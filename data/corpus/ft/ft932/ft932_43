FT  17 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No right to allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM A basic-rate taxpayer aged over 65. My total income for tax purposes is
about Pounds 20,000 and I do not receive an age-related personal or married
couple's allowance. My wife is a 20 per cent band taxpayer aged over 65 with
a total income of about Pounds 4,500. She does get a personal age allowance.
1. Am I right in thinking that I still cannot have an age-related personal
or married couple's allowance? 2. If I am right, and if I were to transfer
my Pounds 1,720 married couple's allowance to my wife, would this then
become a Pounds 2,465 married couple's age allowance for her in 1994/95?
(being too late to apply for 93/94).
3. On a different subject, am I right in thinking that the new advance
corporation tax rates in 1993/94 and in 1994/95 onwards apply to income from
equity-based unit trusts as well as to share dividends (but not to interest
from banks or building societies)?
1. Yes.
2. No.
3. Yes.

FT  17 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Change of ownership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY SON and I own a three-bedroom holiday house in Wales. But I am 91 and my
wife 90 and we are no longer able to go. I am considering giving my half
share to my daughter-in-law. How should I do this? Also, I have two sons,
five grand-children and one great grand-child. Are there advantages in
forming a family trust?
You could give the home to your daughter-in-law, or in trust for your
children and grandchildren. For inheritance tax purposes, if you gave it
away but continued to use it without paying rent, you could be caught by the
'gift with reservation' rules. But if you can no longer use it, you are no
longer getting a benefit from it and the gift can be made without these
rules applying. The effect of the gift with reservation rules would be that
the property would stay in your estate for IHT purposes even though you had
given it away.
Should you die within the next three years, the value of the gift will
become chargeable to IHT. But if property values increase over the next few
years, then the increase in value will escape IHT. Once you have survived
for three years, then tapering relief would apply. But this might not be
helpful as the gift could be covered by your nil rate band, so other assets
in your estate would be subject to IHT at the full rate. For the gift to
create the IHT savings you propose, you would need to live for seven years
so that the gift becomes exempt fully.
It might be worth considering other assets in your estate which could be
gifted. It would be possible for these to be transferred into a trust for
the benefit of your children/grand-children.
One of the drawbacks of giving property is that, if the value of the
property increases in the future, there could be capital gains tax
disadvantages. If your daughter-in-law were to sell the house at some future
time, the probate value might be higher than the present value so less CGT
would be payable. You need to weigh possible IHT savings against potential
CGT disadvantages.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Making CGT work for you - Philip
Coggan considers the pros and cons of a new tax-efficient investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 is one of the great
unexploited tax breaks. Scottish fund management group Ivory &amp; Sime will
launch a new investment trust in May which will use the CGT allowance to
offer investors a 7 per cent tax-free income, paid monthly.
Investors in the trust - Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS - will earn their income by
monthly sales of shares. Over the long term, the stock market tends to rise
at a rate greater than 7 per cent. Thus, Ivory &amp; Sime believes investors can
receive their income without depleting their capital long term.
If investors have not used up their CGT allowance elsewhere, this monthly
income plan is highly tax-efficient. A basic-rate taxpayer who gets Pounds
5,800 of dividend income will pay Pounds 1,160 in tax; the higher rate-payer
will pay Pounds 2,320. But there is no tax to pay on the first Pounds 5,800
of capital gains. Put another way, this 7 per cent income is equivalent to
9.33 per cent gross from the building society for basic rate-payers.
Another point in favour of the monthly income plan is that there are no
initial or annual charges; nor are there any dealing costs when selling
shares. And the trust does not need to invest in high-yielding (and possibly
low-quality) stocks for investors to earn their income. ISIS will buy growth
stocks in the FT-SE 350 index and will have a below-average portfolio yield,
giving scope for capital growth.
One potential snag is that the steady sale of shares by income investors
will create an ever-widening discount. But I&amp;S hopes to get round this
through its monthly savings scheme, which will offer a loyalty bonus (in the
form of warrants) for those who put money away for a full year. It hopes the
added value provided by the warrants will lure enough people into the
savings scheme to provide a regular demand for shares and eliminate the
discount problem.
Like the monthly income plan, there are no initial or annual charges. The
savings plan does not pay income but, for those who are likely to pay CGT,
there is a Pep option at no extra charge. Those who buy shares in the trust
will receive no conventional dividend income. Instead, the future dividend
income stream is being sold to institutions in the form of convertible
annuity shares, with a seven-year life.
There are two advantages to this structure. The first is that the sale of
the future income stream generates cash up-front which immediately boosts
the asset value of the ordinary shares. The second is that the annuity
shares absorb Ivory &amp; Sime's annual management charge.
It all sounds too good to be true, so what could go wrong? If there were to
be a repeat of Black Monday, or a prolonged bear market, investors could
find they were rapidly eating up capital to provide their income. This could
also occur if I&amp;S managed the portfolio badly and underperformed the market
substantially.
The existence of the warrants will also have a dilutive effect on the net
asset value per share performance - but Ivory &amp; Sime argues that, since the
warrants are available only to monthly savings investors, the dilution will
be small.
Probably the biggest question is whether the structure will work and enough
monthly savings plan investors will be found to buy the shares sold by the
monthly income investors. If that does not happen, shares will have to be
sold at a discount to pay the income, which could erode investors' capital.
Still, this is an ingenious, low-cost and tax-efficient scheme. As Robin
Angus of County NatWest has argued, investors should concentrate on total
return rather than aiming for high income alone. This trust gives them a way
of doing so. You could argue about whether it can be classified as a split
capital trust. What is certainly true is that there are no classes of shares
with a prior claim on its assets; thus, the ordinary shares represent a
'clean' investment.
Full details of the trust will not be available until next month but a
helpline is open on 0800-441 441.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Proof that he who ventures wins -
Philip Coggan examines the record of Pantheon International Participations,
which profits from a somewhat esoteric strategy - Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE best-performing investment trusts over the past year could well
be one of the least known.
Indeed, the trust's name, Pantheon International Participations, or PIP for
short, does not give much of a clue as to what it does - investing in other
people's venture capital funds.
This rather esoteric-sounding strategy has been fairly successful in recent
times - according to Micropal, it was the fourth best-performing non-split
capital investment trust over the year to April 1 (mid-market to mid-market
with income re-invested) with a rise of 93.5 per cent.
It was top of the venture capital sector over that period and third over
both the three- and five-year periods.
What is the rationale for PIP's investment policy? Most venture capital
trusts buy direct equity holdings - but this can involve them in a lot of
hands-on management if the companies get into difficulties. PIP avoids that
problem.
Furthermore, PIP's policy means its portfolio is highly diversified. Each of
the funds in which it invests has a wide range of holdings - so the damage
caused by the failure of any one company is much smaller.
Other venture capital trusts, such as Drayton Consolidated, have been hit
badly by prominent corporate collapses.
PIP also can benefit by buying so-called 'secondary interests.' Many venture
capital funds are launched on a private basis, with fund managers persuading
a number of institutions to participate.
If one of those institutions then wants to sell, PIP can acquire their
holdings. And given the lack of alternative purchasers, usually it can buy
at a discount.
Some of the recent uplift in performance, however, has come from a special
factor. In February 1989, the trust purchased approximately Pounds 20m of
unquoted assets from the water authorities.
The bulk of the consideration was in the form of convertible loan stock.
This had a nominal rate of interest - 3 per cent - which was rolled up to
allow the water authorities to purchase more ordinary shares when conversion
became profitable.
Since then, the water authorities have been replaced as owners of the
convertible by the National Rivers Authority, which decided it wanted to
realise the convertible for cash. PIP has agreed to buy it back, but at a
discount to face value.
This resulted in a double boost to net asset value per share - the value of
the debt fell and the prospect of the creation of a large number of new
shares disappeared.
But there is hope of a more fundamental pick-up in net asset values as the
US and UK economies recover. Venture capital funds tend to lag behind the
quoted sector. Valuations are based on the previous year's profits, and thus
will reflect the depressed conditions of 1992.
Stock market investors already are anticipating the increases in profits in
late 1993 and 1994; eventually the unquoted sector could catch up.
Of course, the whole issue of valuation is one which has dogged the venture
capital sector. Investors have been disillusioned as managers have written
down their previous valuations in response to bad news.
The result has been that trusts have traded at wide discounts to net asset
values - 33 per cent in the case of Electra, the biggest trust in the
sector. (PIP stands at a 20 per cent discount.)
PIP says it scrutinises the valuations given by the managers of funds in
which it invests - and applies a discount if necessary. It never increases
the manager's valuation.
But Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, says that PIP has
in the past bought portfolios at a discount and then written up the holding
to asset value. 'That is not necessarily a conservative approach,' he points
out.
He stresses, however, that manager Rhoddy Swire probably has the best
knowledge of US venture capital funds of anyone he has met.
The group has a large concentration of its portfolio in the US, where the
venture capital market is more developed than elsewhere.
At June 30 1992, its UK content was 43.8 per cent (funds 27.2, unquoted 8.4,
gilts 8.2) and the US portion was 51.4 per cent (funds 44, unquoted 5.8,
quoted 1.6). Japanese and continental funds made up the remainder.
PIP's largest 10 investments at June 30, 1992 were: Juno International
Participations; Scotia Holdings; Sequoia Capital IV; Grosvenor Technology
Fund; Apax Ventures II; New Enterprise Associates III; APA Excelsior Venture
Capital Holdings (Jersey); Southwest Enterprise Associates; Fleming
Ventures; and East of Scotland Industrial Investments.
The trust was floated in September 1987 as GT Ventures. Although it was
launched a month in advance of the crash, it did not invest any money before
Black Monday, and so was unaffected by the stock market turbulence that
followed.
Since then, Swire has set up an independent management company, Pantheon, to
run the trust. GT sold its remaining holding in Pantheon last year and the
trust's name was accordingly changed from GT Venture.
Any venture capital fund is risky, and PIP is not for the cautious or for
the short-term, investor.
Warburg's Aaron says the trust might be attractive to those who believe,
like him, that it is quite a good time to be exposed to the US venture
capital sector - particularly in view of the stimulus package proposed by
President Bill Clinton.
Key facts
At the end of December, the trust's gross assets were Pounds 35.3m and the
net assets were Pounds 27.8m. As of April 14, the trust's net assets per
share were 176.1p, according to NatWest Securities. At 142p, the shares were
trading on a discount of 19.6 per cent and a yield of 2.2 per cent.
Board
Thomas Griffin, chairman, was one of the founders of GT Management. The
other directors are: John Brakell, the manager (venture capital) at Postel
Investment Management; Alain Lefebvre, a director of a number of continental
investment companies; Richard Stanley, a director of Friends Provident;
Lionel Sackville, chairman of Union Jack Oil; and Swire.
Savings scheme and Pep details
Pantheon has no savings scheme and does not qualify for Pep status.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S table is dominated by directors taking advantage of the new tax
year to exercise and sell options. The large sales by nine of the directors
of Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, included disposals by Hugh
Armytage, Kevin Grant-Dalton and David Low, who sold Regis Low to SBJ and,
under the terms of the sale agreement, were entitled to sell 928,555 shares
on or after January 7 1993. They have now sold most of these. Six other
directors sold various amounts of stock while the three non-executive
directors, including the chairman, made small purchases.
Over the past 18 months, the directors of Rathbone Brothers have sold shares
to satisfy demand from the market; and the recent disposals by four of them
leave the board still owning about 34 per cent of the issued ordinary
shares.
Shares in Granada Group, the television and leisure company, have continued
to perform well. The recent exercise and sale of options by Graham Wallace
at prices between 393p and 402p, follows purchases by Charles Allen of
100,000 shares at the end of March and 85,000 in August at prices of 350p
and 235p, respectively. Last week also saw an announcement that the finance
director had purchased 10,000 at 398p.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Lender offers to explain - A credit
confession by Barclaycard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYCARD, which turns down almost half of new applicants for its credit
card, is to explain to applicants its reasons for rejecting them.
Until now, issuers of credit cards have fought shy of disclosing too much
information, claiming that this would make them vulnerable to fraudsters.
Last year, however, Sir Gordon Borrie, Director General of the Office of
Fair Trading, said lenders should be more open about their use of credit
scoring - a technique used to decide whether to grant credit.
The system works by allocating points to various characteristics which the
lender believes will help predict whether an applicant will repay credit.
These include age, occupation and residential status. The total score is
then used by the lender to decide whether to issue a card.
Barclaycard, which ran a pilot study on 3,000 people late last year, says it
has decided to tell applicants why they failed the credit scoring process
because it believes many creditworthy customers slip through the net. It
hopes to accept thousands of new customers a year as a result.
'Being refused a new credit card must come to many customers as a shock,'
said Bob Potts, managing director of Barclaycard. 'This new scheme is
designed to explain why a card has been refused and will particularly help
consumers whose ability to repay credit cannot easily be established from a
standard credit card application form.'
Although there may be many areas in which a low overall score is made, Chris
Tucker, of Barclaycard, says that one section may let down an applicant more
than others. Pilot tests showed that the most common reason was an inability
by Barclaycard to verify bank or building society details. This was not
necessarily because of bad relations between an individual and their bank
but because it was not the bank's policy to provide details.
Sometimes an applicant is refused because they have not made clear what
their job is. A house move could also contribute to a low score because the
applicant may not yet be on the electoral roll which Barclaycard would use
to verify details of where they live.
'We've been asking card issuers for a long while to do this and we applaud
Barclaycard for providing this improved service,' said Graeme Jacobs, of the

Associated British Foods, the bread to sugar group, reports interim results
on Monday and is likely to show little change on the Pounds 175.2m pre-tax
made in the comparable period. While baking margins are still under
pressure, the group's British Sugar division is expected to have gained from
the green pound devaluation.
Hammerson, the UK's third biggest property company, will on Tuesday reveal
the damage inflicted by the collapse of the property market in the UK,
Canada and Australia, its main markets. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to
fall from Pounds 55.5m to around Pounds 43m, while net assets per share may
fall from 637p to 470p. It is expected to unveil a cut in its 1992 dividend
payout from 20.5p to 10p, as indicated by its interim results in October.
Smiths Industries, the defence and aerospace components group, is expected
to report on Wednesday a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to
about Pounds 40m. Analysts believe restructuring could lead to exceptional
costs.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, reports interim
results on Thursday, with City expecting a drop in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 37.2m to about Pounds 25m. Some expect interim dividends to be
reduced (1.85p last time).

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Brokers who fail to deliver the
goods - Insurance intermediaries are sharply criticised in a new survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE brokers are quick to recommend their services as the best route to
obtaining value for money from home and motor policies, as well as good
advice and service. But a Consumers' Association (CA) survey, published
today, suggests that brokers and other intermediaries rarely deliver on
their promises.
'The incompetence of some of the insurance intermediaries was truly
alarming,' said Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the CA. 'Breaches of
relevant codes were common and flagrant. Too many intermediaries claimed
false status, offered inappropriate policies, and refused to answer
legitimate questions.'
CA conducted the survey by sending anonymous CA researchers to visit a
random selection of 82 intermediaries - brokers, who sell policies on behalf
of a number of companies - and agents, who sell for a limited number of
companies - in six towns - Rotherham, Chichester, Preston, Bolton, Norwich
and Hemel Hempstead. Each of the researchers sought advice over the purchase
of a home contents insurance policy. Their requirements were standard apart
from two factors: an expensive portable computer (not used for business) and
a possible absence on holiday of more than 30 days.
The conclusions of these interviews show that too 'often, intermediaries
were incompetent and ill-informed.'
The survey shows that the majority of insurance intermediaries breached
'virtually all the provisions of the codes of practice which supposedly
govern the sale of non-life insurance.'
Flagrant breaches of the codes of the Association of British Insurers, the
industry trade association, and Insurance Brokers Registration Council
included the following:
Sixty-five of the 82 intermediaries did not disclose the amount of
commission they received, even when asked.
Many brokers did not state whether they were tied or independent. Some of
the insurance sellers 'clearly did not understand the requirement to
disclose their status: one even said that he did not know what being tied or
independent meant.'
Only four intermediaries were able to hand over a full copy of the insurance
policy they were selling. Most of the intermediaries surveyed did not appear
to have a copy of their policy for their own reference, usually working from
rating guides. One intermediary said as he handed over a policy document:
'Will you understand it? We don't'
Among other shortcomings highlighted in the report:
Intermediaries rarely warned buyers about the consequences of non-disclosure
of information. Some 53 intermediaries recommended 'clearly inappropriate'
insurance policies. Few intermediaries provided adequate information about
policy details.
'In the majority of cases, terms with a distinct meaning under the policy,
such as 'valuables', were left undefined . . . information on exclusions was
virtually never volunteered . . . researchers were rarely warned of any
excess (the part of any claim that the policyholder must pay).'
Most intermediaries asked too few questions to establish customers' needs -
out of six possible questions (picked from typical proposal forms), 50
intermediaries asked questions in only one or two categories. 'It is
therefore hardly surprising that whether policies were suitable (eg in terms
of having few exclusions that would be a problem for the customer) appears
to have been a matter of chance,' says the CA.
Concluding, the CA report pulls no punches. It says that although the
insurance market is highly competitive, individual consumers are poorly
placed to benefit without good information and good advice. 'At the moment,
in too many cases, they are receiving neither, and instead are burdened with
the costs of being sold unsuitable products,' it says.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Protect yourself against school fee
inflation - John Authers with timely advice on how to pay for your child's
education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARENTS with children of school age must feel trapped between the devil and
the deep blue sea.
The strife over national curriculum tests in the state sector is
well-publicised. Meanwhile, the independent sector makes life harder for
parents by continuing to increase its fees far faster than inflation.
According to a provisional estimate by the Independent Schools Information
Service, fees have risen by 8 per cent in the last year - way ahead of
earnings or price inflation. ISIS's figures show that in 1992 at the senior
level girls day schools cost from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 2,100 per term
while boarders paid from Pounds 2,100 to Pounds 3,500. Boys' schools tended
to be more expensive, with fees ranging up to Pounds 2,600 per term for day
boys, and Pounds 3,700 for boarders.
If school fees inflation resumes at its average rate for the last few years
of ten per cent, projections of the total bill sound alarming. According to
Sun Life, educating a child born in 1992 at independent schools from the
ages of seven to 18 would cost Pounds 310,000.
Perhaps it is not surprising that parents are resorting to desperation
tactics.
Group Captain David Goucher, bursar of Bryanston, elaborated on some
techniques in the latest edition of the Headmasters' Conference magazine:
'The common ploys, familiar to all bursars, for delaying the day of
reckoning include the accidental misdating of cheques, an irate telephone
call ten days into a new term complaining that the bill has not arrived and
delivering dire threats if the next account includes a surcharge for late
payment, computer breakdowns in the international bank credit transfer
system, fees not yet released by trust funds, insurance companies and
building societies, and, not least, the pathetically disabled duck excuse
that the cheque must have been lost in the post.'
None of these techniques is recommended. It makes more sense to save in
advance, which will lessen the burden of fees once you have to pay them, and
to take out insurance against sudden falls in income.
It is also worth analysing what the school is intended to achieve. If you
just want good exam results, then the best 'value for money', assuming your
child is able to beat the competition, should come from big city single-sex
day schools. They are cheaper than boarding schools.
Once you have decided on a school, you should find out from the bursar how
much it will cost.
Parents who think that meeting fees will be difficult should ask the
following questions:
How much help can the state provide?
The government-backed assisted places scheme will pay fees for children from
low-income households. The amount of government help will depend on your
family's 'relevant income', which includes the total pre-tax income of both
parents, and any unearned income from dependent children. It does not
include social security benefits, and an allowance of Pounds 1,105 is
deducted for each child in the family who is not applying for an assisted
place.
On this basis, families with income up to Pounds 9,056 are eligible to have
their fees paid in full. Assistance for families on higher incomes is
available on a declining scale. The maximum income you can have is Pounds
25,000. Parents interested in the scheme should contact the Department for
Education Assisted Places team, Mowden Hall, Darlington, Durham DL3 9BG
(tel. 0325 392163), which provides details of the scheme and the schools
involved.
Can the school help out?
Several schools offer pre-payment plans, which can work out as offering
better value than paying as you go along. The volume of fee income which
arrives late leaves them feeling grateful for the improved cash flow. Some
also have scholarship funds.
School schemes can be inflexible. Some, such as Harrow's, will allow you to
transfer money to another school. Others will not.
Are the fees protected for the future?
This is most important if you have not saved in advance, and need to fund
fees out of your regular income. Life term insurance for the main bread
winner of the family, to last until the end of your youngest child's
projected school career, makes sense and should not be expensive.
Permanent health insurance, to protect your income in the event of ill
health, could be vital. ISIS has launched three schemes, administered by the
broker Mason &amp; Mason, to help when economic life gets tougher.
Future Term allows you to cover against death, disability, and redundancy
(or bankruptcy for the self-employed) for the period of your child's
education. The rates are expressed as a percentage of fees covered, and will
increase at the end of June. They are - 1.5 per cent for death, 1.75 per
cent for disability, and a maximum of 3 per cent for redundancy. The entire
package would therefore cost 6.25 per cent of fees, and the scheme will not
pay out if you are made redundant within 90 days of joining.
That is an individual scheme. Rates are lower if your child goes to a school
covered by Feesure. This covers the fees against disability, redundancy or
bankruptcy, again with a 90-day period at the beginning of the policy. It
will pay out for a maximum of 12 months.
A scheme launched this week will be administered by schools. Educare will
cover all fees against redundancy or disability for a flat premium of 1.5
per cent. The risk for the insurers is sufficiently reduced by covering so
many parents that they can afford not to bother with the 90-day exclusion at
the beginning of the scheme.
Contact ISIS on 071-630-8793, or Mason &amp; Mason on 0625-529 536, for further
details.
It is best, while you have time, and a high income, on your side to save
capital to be protected against these problems. If that is no longer
possible, there is no reason to allow independent education to become even
less accessible by failing to take out protection.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pibs may fit the bill - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu considers fixed-interest instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED-interest instruments are attractive against today's economic
background of low inflation and relatively low interest rates.
To those looking for income, the fixed-interest market is able to offer
higher yields than the building societies. Two of the most accessible
fixed-interest instruments for private individuals are bond funds and
permanent interest bearing shares.
Bond Funds
Bonds are simply IOUs where the issuer agrees to pay interest and to return
the capital on maturity. But since they can be traded, their market price
varies during their life.
They come in a variety of forms, the best-known in Britain probably being
government-issued securities gilts).
Few people hold a bond from issue to maturity, and the price at which they
buy it might not be the same when they sell. Most gilts trade 'above par
value' (in the jargon), so there is always a risk of capital loss - the
sacrifice for getting a higher income than might otherwise be available.
The relationship between the interest rate and the bond's price is measured
by the yield. The running yield is calculated by dividing the interest rate
by the market price. As prices rise, yields fall, and vice-versa.
Many people feel they lack the expertise to buy individual bonds and find
bond funds a convenient alternative.
Most bond funds are unit trusts which, by investing in a portfolio of bonds,
aim to provide the client with income and/or capital growth. Since investors
must pay both initial and management charges, they will want to make sure
the fund's performance makes up for the fees.
The table of the 10 largest UK bond funds with three-year records shows the
yield and performance in terms of percentage growth.
Most of the funds listed invest in gilts but some, such as CU Preference,
invest in the fixed-interest shares of companies.
Since companies can go bust and the UK government cannot, the increased risk
of CU Preference is reflected in an above-average yield, but its performance
 -the lowest of the 10 - should caution investors not to look simply at the
yield when choosing a bond fund.
Some funds might offer a high yield which is achieved purely by eating up
capital. That might be attractive to some investors, but they should know
what they are buying.
Investors should also be aware that profits from a bond fund are subject to
capital gains tax - which is not the case if the investor had bought
government securities directly.
Barclays Unicorn gilt fund, the largest, has both a high yield and the best
performance over three years of the 10 quoted.
Apart from gilts, it also holds fixed interest securities in companies such
as British Telecom and Barclays bank. The initial charge is 3.25 per cent on
amounts up to Pounds 5,000 and reduces after that; the yearly fee is 0.75
per cent.
Not all bond funds aim to give a high income. Whittingdale's Short Dated
gilt fund, which has the lowest yield - 3.5 per cent - of the funds listed,
is aiming for capital growth through investment in short-dated,
fixed-interest securities. But its performance is lower than the sector
average, although it is top over five years.
Permanent Interest
Bearing Shares
These are issued by building societies to raise capital and are classified
as debt. The market is small so far and began in July 1991 when Leeds
Permanent launched the first issue.
Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of basic-rate tax. Any gains when
selling are exempt from CGT. But they are deeply subordinated - which means
that if the society collapsed, holders would be last in the line of
creditors for repayment. These risks are reflected in the yields, which are
higher than those for bond funds.
Since Pibs are irredeemable, the building society is under no obligation to
repay the principal, so the original investment can be regained only by
selling them.
Like bonds, the investor is exposed to the risk of a capital loss. So far,
though, most holders have seen the value of their shares rise. Indeed, since
we published a table last month showing prices at midday on March 11, all
have risen - gently, in most cases. Skipton and Bradford and Bingley 11 5/8
have risen by 0.5p, while Bristol &amp; West has seen a rise of just under 4p.
Yields have fallen correspondingly but are still some of the highest
available on the fixed-interest market. Hoare Govett says that, of the Pibs
on issue, it believes Bristol and West 13 3/8 is the most under-valued.
The society had a setback last year when interim results showed a 65 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits, but it went on to register full-year figures
which were down 42 per cent on the previous year. Hoare Govett says it
believes the price for the Pibs fails to reflect the upturn at the full-year
stage.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: FT Quarterly Review of Personal
Finance - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession may be easing, but redundancy continues. Increasingly, those
who lose their jobs are middle-class professionals and executives, many of
whom have found redundancy a mixed blessing, allowing them to embark on new
careers. Meanwhile, steps can be taken to soften the impact, and to protect
one's financial position during a traumatic period. The spring issue of the
FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be published with next Friday's
paper and repeated with Saturday's, suggests 10 sensible steps to take if
the axe should fall. The Review also includes a survey on Investment Trusts.

FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Analysts divided over gold price
direction - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices wobbled this week after achieving a five month high on April 2.
Analysts appear divided about whether the recent rises mean a rally in a
bear market or the beginning of a new bull market. Ted Arnold, metals
specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, suggested that
gold prices probably had bottomed out but thought it unlikely that prices
would rise rapidly. 'There is little doubt that Asian demand would dry up
very rapidly and we would expect to see selling by investment jewellery
holders in both Asia and the Middle East,' he said.

FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Bond's the name, bank stock is the game - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THEY say in the baseball park: 'It ain't over till it's over,' a point
the New York Yankees learnt the hard way in the dying moments of two games
against the Kansas City Royals this week. Like the Bombers from the Bronx,
the US stock markets also got hit by a bolt from the blue this week - but
this one did more good than harm.
Ten days ago, the bond market rally, which had proved a source of strength
for equity investors for the best part of the year, looked to be over. The
yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond, which had fallen to an
all-time low of 6.72 per cent in early March, had jumped back up past 7 per
cent and appeared to be heading even higher.
Fixed-income investors were selling bonds because they feared inflationary
pressures were building up again in the economy.
The retreat unsettled equity investors, who had been looking to declining -
or at least low - interest rates to provide fuel for economic growth for the
rest of the year. Their concern peaked on April 2 when bond yields returned
to 7 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up almost 70 points
in one day, dropping below 3,400 in the process.
This week, however, everything seemed to go in reverse. Reassured by recent
low inflation statistics, and pleased bythe news from the White House that
President Clinton was prepared to compromise over his economic stimulus
plan, treasury investors began buying bonds again and pushed the yield down
to 6.71 per cent - the lowest since the government began regular auctions of
30-years in 1977.
The stock markets, delighted by this unexpected turn of events, rallied. In
the 6 1/2 days since bond yields dropped back under 7 per cent, the Dow
gained 75 points and is now trading above 3,450.
Not surprisingly, interest-rate sensitive stocks - banks, other financial
companies and utilities - have been at the forefront of the rally.
Undermined initially by fears of rising rates, they all have rebounded in
recent days.
Bank stocks have been particularly buoyant, not just over the past week but
for the entire year so far. The shares of a host of big commercial operators
 -including Citicorp, Wells Fargo, Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica, Banc One
and First Chicago - all are trading at, or close to, their 52-week highs.
Improved asset quality and impressive earnings momentum have contributed to
the boom.
The improvement in earnings has been particularly spectacular - and
industry-wide, judging by the first batch of quarterly bank reports out so
far. Five banks posted the following percentage increases in their
first-quarter earnings this week: First Union, up 158 per cent; First of
America, up 125 per cent; NBD, up 94 per cent; Bank of New York, up 56 per
cent; and Huntington, up 48 per cent. Anticipating such gains, investors
have been buying bank stocks all year.
According to American Banker, the market value of the largest US banks
jumped 12.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, and the
publication's index of bank shares climbed 10.7 per cent in the quarter,
nearly triple the gains achieved by the Standard &amp; Poor's index.
JP Morgan has been among the very best performers in the sector. Yet, the
New York group has ridden the coat-tails of the boom in brokerage stocks
this past week, an indication that the market regards JP Morgan stock as
just as much of a securities industry play as a banking play.
As one of the few US banks allowed to operate in the domestic securities
markets, JP Morgan earns more from its underwriting of new debt and equity,
and from its trading of securities and sophisticated derivative products,
than it does from such traditional banking activities as lending. Its Wall
Street-type business spurred the bank to pre-charge profits of Dollars 432m
in the opening quarter, news of which helped to lift the shares Dollars 4
3/4 to Dollars 73 1/2 this week. Fortunately for JP Morgan, it is not
identified so closely with brokerage stocks that when profit-taking hits the
sector, as it did on Thursday, it gets trampled in the rush to sell.
In the first three days of the week, investors could not get enough of
brokerage stocks. Another impressive quarter from industry leader Merrill
Lynch, which unveiled record three-month profits of Dollars 342m, had
sparked the buying.
By Thursday, however, there was a feeling that the buying might have been
overdone and that it was time to take some profits in the sector. Even
shares in discount broker Charles Schwab, which announced record earnings,
were hit hard.
To borrow another baseball saying, it seems as if the Fat Lady has sung for
brokerage stocks - at least for now.

FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Sweating in the Crucible - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO REPORT profits bang in line with forecasts and then watch your share
price tumble 20 per cent must be a chief executive's recurring nightmare.
But this has happened at Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group.
Its Pounds 61.3m profits, reported last week, triggered a 66p fall to 279p
at the close yesterday.
Hurt and chastened, chief executive Bruce Farmer, whose acquisitive approach
has built Morgan Crucible, continued with a walking holiday in Scotland
while the company and its advisers prepared for a hard round of
presentations to institutional investors. Their main concern is Morgan's
apparent inability to generate cash. Implicit in this is the fear that
Pounds 174m raised in two rights issues in 1990 and 1991 might not have been
spent wisely.
But the catalyst for the sell-off last week was concern about the group's
red-blooded use of acquisition provisions. The habit has been losing favour
rapidly since the Accounting Standards Board proposed that most such
provisions should be taken as expense items through the profits and loss
account.
Morgan Crucible greeted the share price fall by pleading it was no worse
than other acquisitive companies like Hanson - which set up more in
provisions last year than it made in profit. But what distinguishes Morgan -
with 'only' Pounds 17m of provisions - from Hanson is that gearing at the
Anglo-US conglomerate is modest. Morgan has gearing of 67 per cent and will
really have to battle to generate the cash to keep this under control.
Herein lies the rub. Morgan Crucible's plight is the result of several
factors, none of which on its own is particularly new but which, together,
were too much for the markets.
First, City analysts looked at what profits would have been had the ASB's
rule changes been in place and the provision items been expensed to the P&amp;L.
Answer: Morgan Crucible would have had a dividend barely covered by
earnings. Could the company sustain this over time? the market asked. What,
if not the yield, was there to support the stock?
Then there was the poor cash flow. At operating margins of 10 per cent, the
group is self-funding only if it makes no further acquisitions and cuts back
capital spending in line with depreciation.
Had past provisioning led to a sharp increase in profitability and cash
generation, the markets might well have been more forgiving. Finally, there
was debt. Some of the jump in gearing was a result of translating
dollar-denominated debt, and interest cover remains high. But even by
selling Holt Lloyd, the car care products company, and some other lower
margin companies for about Pounds 60m, debt might not fall dramatically.
Investors are going to need some convincing that they are not going to be
asked to stump up more cash in the near future.
Morgan Crucible recognises a cash call would not wash for some time. 'Before
we can breath a word about any sort of fund-raising exercise, shareholders
have a right to see an improvement in performance,' says Graham Swetman,
finance director.
The market's short sharp shock might, therefore, have a good effect if
Morgan does indeed focus on raising margins, squeezing cash from working
capital and resisting the acquisition trail.
And there are other things going for it. It has cyclical recovery potential;
the sale of Holt Lloyd would not only raise cash but increase the overall
group operating margin; in the long term, the carbon and thermal ceramics
business should be cash-generative, if not growth businesses; while
technical ceramics and speciality materials - after some pruning - should be
profitable growth businesses.
So, the prescription for Morgan seems clear. The greatest problem could be
Farmer's sometimes overwhelming enthusiasm for technology, which might not
always be good for profitability.
No doubt he will return, rejuvenated, from springing across the Scottish
heather. He could find this energy being channelled firmly - by advisers,
investors and some not too far from his own board - towards sweating the
businesses he owns already.

FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Steering a safe course offshore - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD of the offshore fund is one which many UK investors choose not to
explore. Certainly many funds are best suited to expatriates. But while the
offshore market will not suit every domestic investor, it does have its
peculiar attractions.
It is a mistake to think that by investing offshore, you are escaping the UK
tax system. Resident UK citizens are liable to pay tax on all their
worldwide income.
But offshore funds can pay income gross and this has a number of potential
advantages. The first is that a non-taxpayer can receive a full income
without the hassle of claiming back tax from the Inland Revenue.
Of course, for cash investors, this facility is now available onshore from
banks and building societies. But onshore bond funds cannot pay gross
income. Given that long term interest rates are now above short term
returns, income-seeking non-taxpayers may well be attracted to offshore bond
funds, which can. These funds frequently invest in Eurobonds, which pay
interest gross.
The second potential advantage is that of cashflow. An investor who receives
gross will have to declare income at the end of the tax year and may not
have to pay tax for several months.
A so-called 'roll-up' fund allows the investor to postpone this tax payment
for even longer. These are deposit-based funds which accumulate interest;
tax is not paid until the income is repatriated. So the income compounds at
a gross, rather than a net, rate; and investors could wait to repatriate
their income until they fall into a lower tax band. This could benefit those
about to retire.
But Graham Barker of Fidelity points out there are many other potential
uses. A non-working spouse could earn exactly as much as their personal
allowance; or children could accumulate income until they reach adulthood,
and become entitled to their own personal allowance.
There is no tax reason for a UK investor to invest in an offshore equity
funds, and in the case of UK equities, it can prove a disadvantage.
It is a golden investment rule that one should not invest purely for tax
reasons: and two other factors are important, security and performance. The
term 'offshore' may conjure up the image of the scandals created by Barlow
Clowes, or for those with longer memories, Bernie Cornfeld.
But it would be wrong to assume that 'offshore' is the equivalent of
'shady'. There is an increasing tendency for funds which want to attract
international investors to move offshore, often to Luxembourg or Dublin.
One reason is that UK tax laws do not allow onshore unit trusts to pay
income gross. International investors do not want to receive income net of
UK tax which must later be reclaimed.
As a consequence, many offshore funds are run by the same perfectly
respectable names, such as Fidelity and GT, that sell unit trusts in the UK.
One of the consequences of European integration is the creation of UCITS
(Undertaking on Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) - funds
authorised in one state which can be sold across the European Community.
Many such funds appear in the back of the Financial Times under the heading
Managed Funds. If a fund appears under the heading 'SIB-recognised' that
means the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's leading financial
services regulator, has accepted that regulation in that centre is of an
equivalent standard to that in the UK. Examples include Bermuda and
Guernsey. The funds also have to satisfy the SIB that they are run in a
proper manner.
If a fund comes under the 'regulated' heading, that can mean one of two
things. The centre may have its own system of regulation, but SIB does not
consider it equivalent to UK standard; or the fund managers have not gone
through the rigmarole of getting UK approval (perhaps because they are not
interested in the UK market). Such funds cannot be promoted in the UK.
The upshot is that if the fund is run by a well-known name, and is
SIB-recognised, the investor has no cause to worry.
As for performance, there is no intrinsic reason why a fund should be better
run offshore than onshore. Our sister publication Money Management lists
rankings for these funds every month. It is important to note that some
funds have a bid-offer spread (as in the UK); others have a single price,
but add on an initial charge. As a result, funds are ranked on a
offer-to-offer basis, and thus the performance shown is slightly better than
the investor has actually achieved.
Offshore funds can offer a slightly wider range of investments. Martin
Harrison of GT points out that onshore trusts are prevented from investing
more than 10 per cent in 'emerging markets', not recognised by SIB. An
offshore fund does not have this restriction. And many of the offshore
currency funds represent a cost-effective way of getting exposure to a
foreign currency.
But this is definitely a field where care and professional advice is needed.
There are plenty of funds to choose from. As of April 1, Finstat listed some
1,762 funds under the offshore heading.

FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Sometimes, a Mars bar just isn't enough - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE those British walkers stranded in the Caucasus, the stock market has
been getting by this week on a handful of Mars bars and a bit of melted
snow.
Not surprisingly, it has failed to put on weight in the process: the FT-SE
100 index closed yesterday at 2824.4, up only 2.6.
The Mars bars were the week's tasty economic statistics; the melting snow
came with indications that customer attitudes to price rises were thawing.
The most important economic figures were Wednesday's statistics for
manufacturing output in February, which showed a 1.2 per cent rise over the
previous month. The rise - the third successive monthly increase - took
manufacturing output to its highest level for 18 months.
Other equally tasty indicators were a sharp improvement in business
expectations of sales in the current quarter, recorded in a survey of 2,000
companies by Dun &amp; Bradstreet; and a healthy rise in air traffic in March.
Estate agents reported good business over the Easter weekend, traditionally
the start of the year's house-hunting season.
Customers' softer attitude to price rises showed up in announcements from
basic materials companies. British Steel announced its second round of price
increases this year, after price rises implemented in recent weeks were
accepted by customers. And RMC and Blue Circle said they planned to raise
prices for building materials such as sand, gravel and concrete.
These signs provided welcome confirmation of the recovery the stock market
has been expecting since sterling left the ERM seven months ago this week.
They were greeted as appetising mouthfuls: the FT-SE 100 index jumped 25
points on Tuesday, the day the Dun &amp; Bradstreet numbers were announced, and
British Steel gained 16 per cent on the week, to close at 94 3/4 p. But the
market is still looking for the more lasting sustenance that will allow it
to move from the trading range in which it has been trapped since January.
Perhaps it has been looking in the wrong place. That is the implicit message
of the equity analysts at SG Warburg Securities, who point to an apparent
irrationality in the way investors have been treating different sectors.
The chart shows the best performing sector of the past seven months,
Contracting and Construction, which has outperformed the FT-Actuaries
All-Share index by 45 per cent since Britain left the ERM. Some of the
individual stocks in the sector have doubled.
The Warburg analysts point out, though, that there is as yet no evidence of
construction activity recovering. Any revival in housebuilding, they say, is
likely to be swamped by further falls elsewhere. 'This must raise questions
about the scale of the rally in the construction sector since last autumn,'
they add.
Other sectors where there is more substantial evidence of economic
improvement have yet to show the same stock market performance. The big
gainers in terms of manufacturing output, according to Wednesday's figures,
have been the pharmaceuticals and computer industries. Capital equipment
producers have also done well: investment goods output was 2.6 per cent
higher in the first quarter of 1993 than in the preceding three months, and
4.1 per cent higher than a year ago.
In stock market terms, though, there is little sign of companies in these
sectors significantly outperforming their peers. Indeed, the pharmaceuticals
companies continue to be the market's dogs, as evidenced by Glaxo's 3.3 per
cent fall in heavy volume on Tuesday merely because US fund manager told a
New York magazine that he disliked the stock.
The Warburg analysts put down these anomalies to investors' recent obsession
with high-yielding shares, an enthusiasm which they view as misplaced, since
there is little dividend growth to come from such companies in the
foreseeable future. 'At best many of the sectors and stocks which have led
performance tables recently are perhaps best regarded as 'fixed interest'
securities in yield terms,' they say, rather sniffily.
The comparison with bonds is an interesting one, since it goes some way to
explain what has happened since September. The stock market slid last summer
after its post-election rally because it had started to fear that sterling's
ERM membership would prove a Doomsday machine for British industry.
Devaluation dismantled the machine. High-yielding shares, the ones closest
to the machine's jaws, benefited most. 'Fixed-interest' securities they may
be; but in bond market terms they had just received a significantly upgraded
rating. Their subsequent share-price performance reflects that fact.
Still, seven months is a long time in stock market terms; by now you might
have expected investors to have moved on, to be looking for those specific
sectors that stand to do well from the pattern of this particular recovery.
Instead, the market still seems to be looking backward.
It has an excuse. The awful effects of the past three years are still
showing up in company figures: Forte cut its dividend this week for the
first time in two decades, reporting pre-tax profits after exceptionals for
the year to January 31 of Pounds 164m, propped up by the Pounds 275m sale of
its Gardner Merchant contract catering business.
And Queens Moat Houses, still suspended, dropped out of the FT-SE Mid 250
index. The change produces a one-off reduction in the index of 10 1/2 points
 -a reminder that, even though the stock may eventually come back to the
market at a higher figure, some Pounds 439m of shareholders' wealth is up in
the air. Queens Moat is still trying to make its figures add up; its
shareholders are on the accountant's version of a walking tour of the
Caucasus.

they beat the stock market. It is a trick far more often claimed than
achieved.
If you look at the performance figures published by Caps, a firm which
measures the investment returns of pension funds, you will find that the
median return on UK equities in 1992 was 22.4 per cent whereas the return on
the All-Share Index was 20.6 per cent. Over ten years, however, these
pension funds have only performed just about in line with the All-Share, and
have underperformed foreign equity markets by about 2 per cent a year.
Have fund managers at last got their act together? In fact it looks as
though their gains resulted from favourable patterns in the market rather
than from bursts of new inspiration. There are detailed explanations, one of
which is the pharmaceuticals effect.
Briefly, Glaxo and Wellcome together account for a significant percentage of
the aggregate value of UK equities (about 5 1/2 per cent at the end of 1992,
down from 7 per cent 12 months earlier). They have a detectable influence
upon the UK market indices but many of their shares are owned by foreigners
or in Wellcome's case by the Wellcome Foundation. In the jargon, UK
investment institutions tend to be underweight in pharmaceuticals.
It follows that when drugs shares are strong the British fund managers
mostly fail to keep up with the market indices, but when Glaxo and Wellcome
tumble, as they did in 1992, and have continued to do in 1993 so far,
British fund managers can hardly help beating the market. If you meet a fund
manager he may prefer to describe this effect more positively but opaquely
as 'stock selection' or 'sector rotation'.
In fund management things are rarely quite what they seem. Investors spend
too much time chasing the impossible and too little pursuing achievable, if
duller, objectives. Such thoughts are stimulated by a re-reading of Charles
Ellis's book Investment Policy: How to Win the Loser's Game, in its new
US-published second edition. Although Ellis, a top US investment services
consultant, originally wrote the book for a professional audience he has
added a chapter for private investors. He says, for instance, do not add up
your wealth more than three or four times a year or you may get too caught
up with what the crowd are doing.
Choosing stocks to beat the market is the classic case of hope triumphing
over experience. Between 1970 and 1990 over 75 per cent of professionally
managed funds in the US underperformed the broad measure of the US stock
market, the S &amp; P 500. Of course, some managers appear to do well: over the
past five years the best UK pension fund managers have outperformed the
average fund by about 3 per cent a year. But will they do so over the next
five years? It would be very surprising.
Fund managers have manoeuvred themselves into the strange position of
offering almost guaranteed disappointment. Other professionals do not fall
into this trap: your doctor and lawyer do not promise to beat their peers,
just that they will do a competent job. But the competent fund manager who
does an average job will underperform his over-ambitious benchmark and will
eventually be sacked.
The only reliable way to achieve higher returns is to invest in higher-risk
assets - in equities, say, rather than fixed interest bonds, or bank
deposits. But this only works in the long run. And it only works if you can
tolerate a sudden market setback without being forced to sell at the bottom.
British pension funds are valued on a smoothed-out actuarial basis, and can
accept a lot of risk, so can have a high equity exposure. US funds are
valued at market prices, are less risk-tolerant and must therefore have a
high proportion of fixed interest securities. Thus, creating the right
framework is much more important in the long run than picking an ace
investment manager who promises to perform better than all the others (he
may well produce some historical figures to back up his claims).
Risk is often ill-understood by professional investors, let alone by
amateurs. Private investors live in dread of another 1987 crash, although
from a long-run perspective Black Monday's collapse was just one of those
temporary misfortunes which must be expected from time to time.
Retail investment institutions are currently doing a roaring trade in
guaranteed products which offer downside protection against a stock market
setback. Often these make ingenious use of the futures markets. But is there
really any point? The market pays equity investors to accept risk. These
fancy products often lose four or five points of gross annual return, of the
same order as the extra return available on equities compared with bonds.
Moreover there are early surrender penalties, plus an unquantifiable risk
that the guaranteed returns will not actually be delivered because of market
failures in a crisis, as happened in the US with so-called 'portfolio
insurance' during the 1987 crash. It might be better to opt for lower-risk
non-equity products in the first place.
Private investors, Ellis points out, also usually fail to understand the
risks involved in high stock market valuations. For the long-term investor
it is best that share prices stay low, so that the future stream of
dividends can be bought more cheaply. However, private punters prefer to buy
into a rising market which creates a glow of prosperity but offers poorer
and poorer value. On the other hand they shun a weak stock market even
though it offers greater future rewards. It is, of course, difficult to
avoid mixing up short-term valuations with long-term objectives: we all like
to make a quick paper profit.
In any case, your friendly fund manager will generously offer to take your
money and beat the market for you. After all, look at what he did last year

FT  17 APR 93 / On song at the opera: Covent Garden has confounded its
detractors but the once-mighty ENO is in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEREMY ISAACS, general director of the Royal Opera House in London's Covent
Garden, can look forward to his dinner tomorrow night. While his colleagues
among the arts world glitterati in the Great Room at London's Grosvenor
House will be awaiting nervously the announcement of the annual Laurence
Olivier awards for excellence in British theatre, opera and dance, Isaacs is
serenely confident.
Not for him the stomach-churning moment when the winning envelopes are
opened and success or failure becomes public property. The reason is that
all eight nominations in the opera categories are for productions or
performances which took place at Covent Garden in the past year.
For Isaacs, it is a change in fortune that would be meat and drink to one of
Verdi's tragic heroines. Last summer, not only were the daggers out for the
combative Scotsman - but they were entering right between his shoulder
blades.
The media was full of an orchestrated campaign criticising his management of
Covent Garden and suggesting that an Arts Council investigation - chaired by
Baroness Mary Warnock, former Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge - would
produce an extremely critical report. The hostile headlines were timed to
influence the board of the ROH as it considered whether to renew his
contract.
In the end, the board wavered only slightly under the pressure and extended
Isaacs' contract for two rather than three years, until 1995. And the
Warnock report, although censuring Covent Garden for giving artistic
considerations priority over finance (not in itself a heinous attitude for
an opera house), was not totally negative. The would-be assassins melted
away and Isaacs ran up many successes.
On Wednesday, he put on a typically bullish performance for the media,
announcing a profit for the year of Pounds 750,000 (reduced to Pounds
266,000 by contingency payments towards early retirements and redundancies)
and audiences over the year of 85 per cent of capacity for opera and 86 per
cent for dance. He also confirmed that the Covent Garden board was
determined to go ahead with its controversial Pounds 150m re-development
programme for the opera house and its surrounds, despite the marked lack of
enthusiasm shown for the project by Warnock and the council, Covent Garden's
main paymaster.
There was even some speculation that Isaacs would be able to announce this
week that the funding for the 'new' Covent Garden, which involves
modernising a back-stage mechanical system that pre-dates the first world
war, was actually in place; but it was not to be. A meeting last month with
John Major, the prime minister, produced expressions of goodwill but not a
firm promise to deliver the Pounds 45m the ROH is seeking from public funds.
It is pledged to raise a matching Pounds 45m itself, with the remaining
Pounds 60m coming from an adjacent commercial development. But Isaacs'
willingness to pursue the project publicly suggests that Covent Garden is
confident the scheme will go ahead.
A few hundred yards down the road at the Coliseum, Peter Jonas, director of
the English National Opera, also has experienced the vicissitudes of
fortune. While Covent Garden could do little right, the ENO was riding a
critical high. Just before last year's general election, its success in
attracting a new, and younger, audience to its acclaimed productions, always
sung in English, was rewarded by the government with the gift of the
Coliseum's freehold, worth Pounds 11m.
It marked a fitting climax to the nine-year reign of Jonas, who had
previously announced he was quitting this summer to take over as supremo of
the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He seemed to be handing over the musical
success story of the age to his successor, Dennis Marks, head of music
programmes at BBC Television. Even when the ENO took considerable risks,
such as a season devoted solely to 20th century operas, the challenge
succeeded.
In the past few months, though, the ENO has lost its glitter. The critics
have started to quibble at the perverse modernistic gloss - often involving
a tilted stage - endemic among its new productions and audiences have been
deserting the Coliseum in worrying numbers.
The failure to win even one nomination for the Olivier awards was
confirmation that Marks takes over a nervous ENO, troubled both artistically
and financially. Audiences this season are down from around 80 per cent to
nearer 65 per cent and the Coliseum reported an annual loss of Pounds 1m,
building towards an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.4m.
By its very nature, opera, as the most expensive and exaggerated of art
forms, always attracts dramas (not to say melodramas) and recent events in
London are tame compared with the traumas in Milan, where the local audience
turned against its former hero and booed Pavarotti loudly; and Paris, where
the new Bastille opera house has been dogged by strikes, resignations and
vast deficits. Yet, beneath the superficial story of an heroic figure
defying hostile forces and subduing them, the recent history of Covent
Garden has a more sinister sub-plot.
Last year, for the first time, there was questioning at the very heart of
the arts establishment as to whether Covent Garden need continue to exist.
Its annual grant of Pounds 19.5m was a sizeable slice of a total Arts
Council budget of Pounds 226m: think how many new arts ventures could be
nurtured on this sum, said the critics. The populists also were shocked by
Isaacs' attempt to solve the ROH's ingrained financial problems by raising
prices way above the rate of inflation, so that a top seat for opera could
easily cost over Pounds 100.
Lord Palumbo, the chairman of the council - who has pioneered the idea of
big building projects to celebrate the millennium - was enthused by a new
national opera house to rise up on London's South Bank, where the capital's
big concert halls are sited. A modernised Covent Garden seemed a second-best
use of scarce resources.
Isaacs' opponents seized upon some lacklustre new productions, plus a series
of disputes with orchestra and chorus which suggested Isaacs was
heavy-handed in labour relations. They also claimed he had an easy-going
attitude to financial controls, At the same time, they could point to the
Coliseum as an opera house for the age, contemporary in approach and
attracting a new audience at popular prices. But, at the crunch last summer,
Covent Garden could still call enough well-connected friends to its defence,
and the improvements in programming came through in time to charm critics
and audiences alike. Now, the scenario has changed radically.
Not that Covent Garden is totally free of problems. The makings of a deal
are in place, but they depend on the present run of good fortune continuing.
The government seems inclined to allocate some of the proceeds from the
proposed national lottery, which should come on stream by the end of 1994,
towards the re-building fund.
In return, Isaacs will eliminate the Pounds 3m deficit by the 1995-96
season. This will be achieved by fewer new productions, a safer repertoire,
and clever programming involving more matinees, popular revivals, and an
acceptance of the Warnock recommendations on reducing operating costs. But
the ballet company seems destined to continue as the poor relation, starved
of the funding needed to increase the number of dancers to an acceptable
performing level, and of fresh productions. This reflects its position as
the inferior revenue-spinner.
Isaacs also has promised that his successor should be in a position to
accept that the modernisation of the opera house will enable savings to be
made backstage, especially in overtime payments. This could increase the
number of performances and, along with an additional 113 seats, reduce the
size of the annual grant, thus saving the government money in the long run.
His hand has been much strengthened by the support of two rich patrons: Lord
Sainsbury, the supermarkets tycoon, and Vivien Duffield, who oversees the
charitable foundation set up by her late father, businessman Sir Charles
Clore; they have pledged most of the Pounds 45m to be contributed by Covent
Garden.
The recent visits by the company to the Far East have paid off handsomely,
too, not only in lucrative sponsorship deals but in uncovering a Japanese
benefactor whose contribution of Pounds 2.5m will help to ensure that the
deficit is paid off by 1995-96.
There are obvious pitfalls ahead. The staff accepted a pay freeze last year
and will be asked to accept a minimal increase, if that, this year. They may
feel they have been squeezed enough. On top of this, the reductions in
overtime could mean employees have less time to spend on quality control in
productions.
The experience of the ENO suggests that audiences are very fickle. In a
recession, too, they are more selective in their occasional visits to the
opera. So far, the ENO has suffered most because its policy of extra
performances of popular revivals lost it the support of those discriminating
opera-goers who went to the Coliseum for an intriguing experience.
The Covent Garden audience probably is richer and more conservative and has,
to date, accepted more evenings of Madama Butterfly and La Boheme. But its
patience could be exhausted soon, especially as seat prices next season have
been raised by 4 per cent, making an average price of Pounds 62 for an opera
performance. At the ENO, the top performance price is Pounds 39.
Isaacs is forcing the pace because the decisions on temporary closure have
to be made in the next three months. The plan is to re-open the modernised
Covent Garden with a great gala, probably of the Berlioz opera Les Troyens,
on December 31 1999. This would involve extended summer breaks in 1996 and
1996 and a total closure from 1997, with the opera company probably confined
to touring abroad or doing seasons at a venue such as London's Royal Albert
Hall while the ballet company camped down in what could be London's new
dance house (lottery money willing).
The favourite sites for this are the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, or the
derelict Lyceum nearby - but both would require a government hand-out almost
as big as that for Covent Garden. So, the imponderables abound. As in many
aspects of national life, much depends on the revenue from the lottery,
which could be worth Pounds 60m a year to the arts.
After a stormy start, Isaacs seems to be getting to grips with the politics
of opera. Marks will have a shorter learning programme. He, too, must raise
money - around Pounds 15m - to shore up his theatre. And, in the short term,
he must stamp a new, popular face on the ENO. The departure of Jonas
coincided with the resignation of his two right-hand men, musical director
Mark Elder and David Poultney, the director of productions.
This gives Marks a clean sheet - but extra responsibilities. His new music
director, Sian Edwards, has little experience of working in an opera house
and has few productions in her conducting repertoire. Her most recent
performance at the Coliseum, in The Queen of Spades, drew mixed reviews.
Jonas is leaving London in a relaxed mood. He has done his bit, taking it
upon himself to fight the corner for the arts - although he feels he failed
to convert the government to the proposition, accepted on the Continent,
that a thriving, publicly-funded arts scene is essential in a civilised
society. There were periods when the message seemed to be accepted but, in
the past two years, the philistines have got the upper hand. Worrying about
finance was the biggest concern of his job - and the reason why the ENO
never performed a complete Ring cycle during his stewardship.
This is an obvious challenge for Marks, and one that could feature when he
announces his 1993-94 programme later this month. He is planning an
attention-grabbing repertoire, including an opening production of La Boheme
in Italian, a provocative break with ENO philosophy. But all Marks' plans
will be controlled by the financial imperatives. The really important ENO
performance takes place on April 27 when the board meets to discuss the
sudden and potentially disastrous financial short-fall. So for some time to
come the dominant theme behind the programmes of both of London's opera
houses will be the same: Money, Money, Money, Money . . .

FT  17 APR 93 / European banana war looms after Fyffes rejects Pounds 421m
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED battle over market share in the European banana market loomed
yesterday with the announcement by Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit and
vegetable distributor, that it had rejected a IPounds 420m (Pounds 421.5m)
bid for the company.
News of the approach, widely believed to have come from the California-based
Dole Foods, drove up Fyffes' share price to around 130p. It followed two
days of heavy trading in the stock as rumours grew of an imminent takeover
bid. Dole said it had no comment to make on the Fyffes' announcement 'at
this stage'.
The board of Fyffes said last night that, having considered the approach,
'which may or may not' have led to an offer of IPounds 1.15p per share, it
decided 'that the proposals involved in the approach are not in the best
interests of the company or its shareholders and, accordingly, the
discussion has terminated'.
Fyffes has become a tempting takeover target for the three world leaders in
the banana business, namely Chiquita (United Brands), Dole (Castle and
Cooke) and Del Monte, which face substantial cuts in their access to the
fast-growing EC market under new Community quota arrangements due to be
implemented in July.
Under the arrangements, the cheap 'dollar' bananas sourced in Central and
South America by the three majors, which supply about 63 per cent of the
European market, will face a quota limit of 2m tons.
Any excess triggers a tariff of Ecu850 (Pounds 677) per ton, around 170 per
cent. About 2.3m tons of 'dollar' bananas were imported by the EC last year,
two-thirds by Chiquita. Fyffes stands to benefit strongly from the new quota
arrangements. Mr Neil McCann, group chairman, said the new quota regime was
vital for the future of the company.
A former UK subsidiary of United Brands, Fyffes was sold for IPounds 29.4m
in 1986 to FII, an Irish fruit distribution company built up by the McCann
family from Dundalk, during the 1960s and '70s. Fyffes received a full
listing on the stock exchange in 1987. At IPounds 1.15p per share,
yesterday's bid values Fyffes at about IPounds 420m, including some 60m
convertible preference shares on top of the 278m ordinary shares.

FT  17 APR 93 / Tarmac in row over stake for US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, the UK construction group, was embroiled in a political row
yesterday over its plan to give a US group a 50 per cent stake in PSA
Projects, the building design division it bought from the government five
months ago.
The Labour party immediately attacked the proposed joint venture with Black
&amp; Veatch, saying it was 'tantamount to handing over a subsidy to an American
company for British public-sector assets'.
Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government minister, said he had written to
Mr John Redwood, his opposite number at the Environment Department, asking
when the government had become aware that Tarmac had 'no intention' of
operating PSA Projects and whether it now proposed to act.
The sale to Tarmac of PSA Projects - formerly part of the state-run Property
Services Agency - proved controversial because of unexpectedly high costs to
the taxpayer. It involved a government payment to Tarmac of Pounds 54.9m to
cover unpaid bills and to meet the cost of putting the business on a
commercial footing, and a further Pounds 40m to cover redundancies.
The Environment Department dismissed Labour charges, saying: 'Those monies
are not going to Black &amp; Veatch. We were not conned; we knew about the
relationship.'
Its officials, it said last night, were aware that Black &amp; Veatch had been
interested in PSA Projects at the time of its deal with Tarmac last
November. However, the department said the proposals for equal control were
a recent development.
Tarmac said the government subsidies were to develop the maximum number of
jobs in PSA Projects and guarantee the terms and conditions of the
workforce. 'To suggest otherwise is nonsense,' it said.
There will be no consideration payment for the joint venture. Tarmac expects
to double its Pounds 50m fee income from PSA's capital projects, at present
worth about Pounds 3.5bn.
Black &amp; Veatch is expected to be given an immediate role in PSA Projects.

FT  17 APR 93 / Inflation rises to 1.9% as retailers lift prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rate of UK inflation nudged higher last month, buoyed by food, clothing
and shoe price increases. Economists, however, believe the introduction of
the council tax this month will have a downward influence on the retail
prices index.
Prices rose by 0.4 per cent in March, compared with February, taking the
annual rate to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent. The underlying measure, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, rose to 3.5 per cent in the year to
March, from 3.4 per cent.
The latest figures indicate that retailers are more confident about raising
their prices as consumer confidence recovers. Clothing and footwear prices,
for example, rose by 1.9 per cent last month compared with February, and by
0.3 per cent year-on-year, the first increase in the annual rate for four
months. Sharper food price rises than a year ago also affected the index.
The rise in inflation led dealers in the money markets to take the view that
the UK government would not cut interest rates below the present 6 per cent.
For the first time since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism
in September 1992, prices in the sterling cash and futures markets implied
that base rates would move upwards from their present levels.
Three-month interest rates in the sterling cash market - often seen as a
bellwether of future rate movements - rose more than   1/16 of a percentage
point to close at 6 1/16 per cent. The cost of borrowing sterling for one
year moved up even more sharply, to 6 3/16 per cent, from a previous close
of 5 7/8 per cent.
The gilt-edged market also reacted badly to the news, with long-dated gilts
shedding a point on the day.
The Treasury said it was 'unconcerned' at the official figures from the
Central Statistical Office. 'We have said all along that there will be a
slight rise in the underlying rate as a result of the devaluation of the
pound, but there is still downward pressure on inflation,' it said.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said inflation had started to rise.
'By the end of the year it will be considerably higher than that of most
other major industrialised countries.'
Although prices often rise in April, it is possible that the annual
inflation rate will drop back this month as the council tax replaces the
poll tax. Council taxes are generally expected to be lower than the poll tax
and statisticians said its introduction would exert a downward influence on
the index.
Some economists, however, said the sharp increase in clothing and footwear
prices heralded renewed inflationary pressures. Mr Leo Doyle, of Kleinwort
Benson, said: 'As the economy gathers strength, it is going to be harder to
repress the inflationary potential that devaluation entails.'
The official figures add to evidence that the UK economy is recovering. They
come after a sharp monthly increase in manufacturing output, and a big rise
in house sales in the first quarter of the year.

FT  17 APR 93 / European banana war looms as Fyffes rejects bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A RENEWED battle over market share in the European banana market loomed
yesterday with the announcement by Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit and
vegetable distributor, that it had rejected a IPounds 420m (Pounds 421.5m)
bid for the company.
News of the approach, widely believed to have come from the California-based
Dole Foods, drove up Fyffes' share price to around 130p. It followed two
days of heavy trading in the stock as rumours grew of an imminent takeover
bid. Dole said it had no comment to make on the Fyffes' announcement 'at
this stage'.
The board of Fyffes said last night that, having considered the approach,
'which may or may not' have led to an offer of IPounds 1.15p per share, it
decided 'that the proposals involved in the approach are not in the best
interests of the company or its shareholders and, accordingly, the
discussion has terminated'.
Fyffes has become a tempting takeover target for the three world leaders in
the banana business, namely Chiquita (United Brands), Dole (Castle and
Cooke) and Del Monte, which face substantial cuts in their access to the
fast-growing EC market under new Community quota arrangements due to be
implemented in July.
Under the arrangements, the cheap 'dollar' bananas sourced in Central and
South America by the three majors, which supply around 63 per cent of the
European market, will face a quota limit of 2m tons.
Any excess triggers a tariff of Ecu850 (Pounds 677) per ton, around 170 per
cent. About 2.3m tons of 'dollar' bananas were imported by the EC last year,
two-thirds by Chiquita.
Fyffes stands to benefit strongly from the new quota arrangements. Mr Neil
McCann, group chairman, said the new quota regime was vital for the future
of the company.
A former UK subsidiary of United Brands, Fyffes was sold for IPounds 29.4m
in 1986 to FII, an Irish fruit distribution company built up by the McCann
family from Dundalk, during the 1960s and '70s. Fyffes received a full
listing on the stock exchange in 1987. At 1.15p per share, yesterday's bid
values Fyffes at around IPounds 420m, including some 60m convertible
preference shares on top of the 278m ordinary shares.
Cash-rich Fyffes is a debt-averse, but acquisitive company. In 1990 it began
a strategy to develop its own sources of 'dollar' bananas in Central
America, with a view to expansion in the post-1992 European Single Market.

FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is logic in the removal of Queens Moat Houses from the FT-SE Mid 250
index at a nominal price of 1p. Its current value is zero because holders
cannot sell. However, assuming the quotation will eventually be reinstated
at a higher price, the move amounts to an unintended distortion of the index
which will come as a blow to the infant derivatives market. The problem
could be avoided if the suspension was lifted, allowing the market to
establish a clearing price. US investors do not expect to be trapped by such
long suspensions.

FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Fyffes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a slice of the banana market changing hands quickly has
slipped away with the rejection by Fyffes' board. It remains to be seen
whether the putative bidder will return for a more aggressive bite. If one
of the large American companies is interested, the temptation must be
strong. The new EC regime has cut the market share of dollar-based producers
and handed it on a plate to Fyffes and Geest. US companies - particularly
Dole, which is the best placed - must be tempted to buy that quota back.
Geest has its own dollar-based plantations, so would not offer an outlet for
more US bananas. Fyffes is thus the more tempting target.
Presumably the Fyffes' board faced a nice calculation. On the one hand, it
might not be sensible to sell out when earnings are about to jump. On the
other, the company is probably at its most attractive to a US acquirer now.
The EC quota system may, after all, be eased in future. If the McCann family
wishes to sell its holding, it may not get a better moment. Perhaps the
offer was seen as inadequate. In which case the board must hope that the
buyer's taste for bananas encourages him back at a fuller price.

FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see a connection between the Dollars 10 rise in the gold
price in the last six weeks and the first mutterings about the inflationary
consequences of recovery. Fighting inflation has taken second place to
restoring growth as a priority of economic policy, not only in the US but
also in the UK and in Japan. In theory that should be good for gold. The
bullion market may be saying that the inflationary risk should be taken
seriously.
Over a slightly longer period, though, the signal is not very strong. Gold
is still Dollars 20 short of its 1992 high and there are other reasons for
its lustre, the latest being fresh political worries in South Africa. In the
background is strong demand for jewellery use, particularly in Asia. The
crisis in Russia also makes the D-Mark less attractive as a financial
investment. Gold, like the Swiss franc, has increased in relative attraction
as an alternative to the dollar. These factors might underpin its price
without any discussion about inflation, but they are offset by the threat of
sales by central banks. More striking is the trend in currencies other than
the dollar. Take the commercial rand for instance. After averaging R980 an
ounce last year, the price has risen to R1080, enough to make a significant
impact on the margins of South African producers. As long as supply is not
disrupted, mining stocks may continue to offer a better return than the
metal itself.

FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the fine details of the business plan being prepared for the
Lloyd's insurance market, it must not fail to attract fresh capital. A
Pounds 2bn loss for the 1990 underwriting year would mean a serious erosion
of capital. Lloyd's cannot be far from the point where it is simply not
viable as a marketplace for big international risks. There is a good
opportunity to attract corporate capital while insurance rates are
hardening, but new entrants will need insulating from mistakes of the past,
such as long-tail claims on pollution and asbestosis.
The idea of leaving underwriting years open right across the market seems to
have been rightly dropped. That would have been unfair on profitable
syndicates. A central fund to manage such long-tail risks would be a more
equitable solution. What remains open is quite which risks should be covered
 -and exactly how it should be funded. New entrants might readily accept a
levy, but only if they can expect a decent return on capital.
Tackling Lloyd's bloated cost base is thus an obvious place for the business
plan to start. Central overheads are only part of the problem. The complex
system of managing agents and members' agents entails too much duplication
of effort. That leaves the sensitive question of pricing, especially the
solvency requirements applied to different forms of capital. If that can be
cracked too, Lloyd's would have at least a fighting chance.

FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lacklustre gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK authorities must be painfully aware that their borrowing programme
leaves them little latitude to choose the timing of gilt auctions.
Yesterday's announcement of a sale of short-dated paper came on a day of
disappointing inflation figures at the end of a week in which the chancellor
has reaffirmed his reluctance to cut interest rates. The inflation news may
be less serious than it looks. Some impact on food prices from the green
pound devaluation was inevitable and it is natural for stores to limit
discounts on clothing and footwear as retail demand returns. That does not
add up to a serious inflationary threat, but it was enough to unsettle long
gilt prices. Since it also makes the prospect of lower base rates even more
remote, there is even less incentive than before at the short end.
It is unclear where the natural demand for the new auction stock lies. This
contrasts with the last sale when domestic institutions were queueing up to
lengthen the maturity of their holdings. The government must hope the
difference of nearly one percentage point between five-year gilts and
three-month deposit rates will again attract hedged funds, but the gap may
have to widen further to entice.
It would be different, of course, if sterling's strength were to change the
government's mind on base rates. Then it could sell short gilts hand over
fist and the equity market might awake from a lethargy which caused it to
all but ignore Wednesday's manufacturing output figures.

FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gains as investors digest
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended a volatile day in mostly positive territory, thanks to
news of some strong quarterly earnings and late options expiration-related
buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.69 at 3,478.61, the
high for the day and a new record. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 finished 0.54 higher at 448.94, while the Amex composite ended up 0.50
at 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite down 3.54 lower at 666.78. Trading volume
on the New York SE was 300m shares.
The market opened in a positive mood, in spite of declining bond prices and
mixed economic reports. The trade deficit widened in February to Dollars
7.2bn as exports, after months of solid growth, fell because of weakness in
overseas economies. March industrial production, meanwhile, was flat.
Although the severe winter storms of last month were partly to blame for the
lack of output growth, the data suggests nonetheless that the economy is not
exactly firing on all cylinders.
Investors, however, chose to ignore the economic news. Attention was
primarily fixed instead on quarterly earnings, and on the afternoon
expiration of options contracts. The expiration led to a backup of buy
orders in many large stocks, temporarily halting some trading. By the close,
the expiration-related business had added about 15 points to the Dow.
Affected by earnings news, Storage Technology jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to
Dollars 25 5/8 after the company reported first quarter operating profits of
14 cents a share, down from a year ago but better than expectations.
One of the day's biggest losers was Gillette, which plunged Dollars 5 to
Dollars 49 after brokerage house Bear Stearns downgraded the stock from a
'buy' to a 'hold'. On Thursday, Gillette announced higher profits, but
static sales.
Wal-Mart, which earlier in the week told analysts that sales growth at its
stores this year would not make it into double-figures, continued to suffer
at the hands of sellers. The retailer's stock fell another Dollars 1 to
Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 6m shares. The stock is within Dollars 1 of its
52-week low.
Manufacturers of brand-name consumer products remained out of favour.
Pepsico fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37, Coca-Cola dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 38 and Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed at a high for the day, as the exchange set a new
volume record. The composite index rose 17.63 points, closing at 3651.86.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 377 to 305.

FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region volatile as
Nikkei declines
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A wave of profit-taking by dealers, investment trusts and arbitrageurs left
equities 1.8 per cent lower ahead of yesterday's summit in Washington
between Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Bill
Clinton, the US president, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 377.98 to 20,297.86, still 1.9 per cent higher on
the week, after a day's high of 20,743.20 and a low of 20,225.78. The
broader Topix Index of all first section issues ended 24.63 lower at
1,565.10.
Volume was estimated at 550m shares compared with Thursday's 637m. Declines
led advances by 821 to 271, with 99 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 1.48 to 1,233.92.
Losses were attributed to political uncertainty and to some nervousness over
Monday's money supply data for March. Data reflecting private bank lending
and demand for time deposits rose last February for the first time in six
months. However, some economists expect negative figures for March,
indicating slower economic recovery.
In spite of the day's declines, the consensus among market participants is
that the Nikkei will hold above 20,000 in the short-term. One analyst at a
British brokerage said that investors were looking for fresh incentives to
join the market.
Profit-taking pushed Sumitomo Metal Mining, again the day's most active
issue, Y22 lower at Y950. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dropped Y10,000 to
Y1.01m.
The financial sector was also under pressure, with Fuji Bank down Y60 at
Y1,990. Mitsubishi Bank lost Y50 to Y2,440 and the Industrial Bank of Japan
dropping Y40 to Y2,600.
Mazda Motor, developing a fuel efficient engine, was actively bought,
gaining Y51 to Y601.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 193.86 to 21,984.83, in volume of 22.5m
shares.
Roundup
THE REGION was mixed, and volatile.
SINGAPORE hit a third consecutive closing high, the Straits Times Industrial
index closing 31.95, or 1.85 per cent higher at 1,763.35, 2.6 per cent up on
the week, as volume fell to 398.9m shares from Thursday's record 550.1m.
KUALA LUMPUR, likewise, saw volume shrink from a record 1.04bn shares to
512.5m as the KLSE composite index rose 1.29 to a new high of 662.02, a
fraction higher on the week.
BANGKOK saw foreign buying and climbed by 1.6 per cent, the SET index
closing 14.44 higher at 888.96, 3 per cent higher on the week, in turnover
up from Bt3.1bn to Bt4.6bn.
AUSTRALIA closed mixed after a strong week, with banking and industrial
stocks ahead and mines mostly easier as the All Ordinaries index eased 0.9
to 1,703.2, up 2.3 per cent on the week.
HONG KONG fell on profit-taking, the Hang Seng index finishing 57.70 lower
at 6,732.04, still 7.1 per cent higher on a week enlivened by news of
renewed Sino-British talks. Turnover was HKDollars 5.68bn against
Wednesday's record HKDollars 7.74bn.
TAIWAN dropped 3.4 per cent on late selling after unconfirmed local media
reports that the country might be included on a list of unfair traders by
the US. The weighted index slid 161.30 to 4,534.19, 6.5 per cent lower on
the week in turnover of TDollars 42.87bn.
SEOUL tumbled as cautious investors pulled back before the market could
reach a new high for the year, the composite index falling 9.90 to 706.86,
0.6 per cent up on the week, as volume rose from 50.9m to 63.2m shares.
BOMBAY picked up to close marginally ahead after a hesitant start. The BSE
index finished 6.66 higher at 2,299.78 - or 0.4 per cent lower on the week -
after recovering from the day's low of 2,259.71.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses continued to mark time yesterday, waiting for next week's
Bundesbank meeting in the hope of more interest rate cuts, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended the week 1.4 per cent ahead, with the DAX index up 3.64 to
1,678.85 in turnover down from DM5.6bn to DM4.8bn.
Volkswagen rose DM6.40 to DM317.70. Dealers liked the fact that the VW brand
name sold 5.2 per cent more cars in March than it did in the same month of
1991.
Mannesmann rose DM3.50 to DM260.50 as it confirmed a DM1.1bn financing
arrangement for its D2 mobile telephone network; Veba climbed DM4.50 to
DM388 on expansion plans at its PreussenElektra power generation unit, and
following a recent Merck Finck buy recommendation which looked for better
things from its cyclical chemicals and oils divisions.
BRUSSELS turned its attention from Petrofina, active this week on unfounded
speculation that Elf Aquitaine might be building on its 5 per cent stake, to
Solvay.
Reports that a number of brokers had reduced their 1993 eps forecasts and
issued sell notes left Solvay BFr300 or 1.8 per cent lower at BFr12,500,
after an intraday low of BFr12,350.
Petrofina suffered some profit-taking as it closed BFr50 lower at BFr9,350,
still 4 per cent better since Tuesday. The Bel-20 index shed 4.86 to
1,254.07, barely changed on the week, in turnover of BFr1.45bn.
MILAN picked up, taking its lead from strong demand for telecoms and helped
by end of account book squaring. The Comit index rose 4.94 to 513.26, little
changed on the week.
Telecoms climbed on proposals to change tariff. Stet, the state holding
company, rose L122 or 5.2 per cent to fix at L2,450 while Sip, the main
telephone utility, added L70 or 3.9 per cent to L1,829. Strong foreign
buying was reported.
ZURICH edged marginally higher ahead of a holiday weekend. A firmer trend in
the dollar helped exporters late in the session and the SMI index rose 2.0
to 2,162.9, 1.1 per cent lower on the week.
Sulzer, the engineering group, rose SFr29 or 4 per cent to SFr755 ahead of
next week's annual news conference which is expected to unveil a bright
outlook for the company.
Alusuisse dipped SFr9 to SFr485 in response to Thursday's late announcement
of a one-for-10 rights issue.
MADRID moved up gently again, the general index closing 0.75 higher at
239.83 for a 2 per cent gain on the week on the conviction that interest
rates are coming down.
PARIS drifted into the weekend with the CAC-40 down 1.94 to 1,986.69 and
unchanged on the week. Turnover slipped to FFr2.1bn.
Total continued to attract buyers but the shares only nudged up 80 centimes
to FFr272, while Elf Aquitaine, which denied that it might be lifting its
stake in Petrofina, rose FFr2.60 to FFr371.50.
Eurotunnel, which is expected to release results on Monday, lost 25 centimes
to FFr38.85.
VIENNA saw an operating loss and a passed dividend take Austrian Airlines
Sch45 or 3 per cent lower at Sch1,485. The ATX index fell 9.81 to 765.46,
off 2.3 per cent on the week.
AMSTERDAM was supported by options expiry as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.1
to 109.7, up 2 per cent on the week. Among the insurers ING added Fl 2.30 to
Fl 67.60 while Amev lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 71.10, on switching following results
from both earlier this week.
DUBLIN extended its gains on the week to 4.5 per cent as the ISEQ overall
index rose 17.93 to 1,591.74, a placing of 55m shares in Irish Life at a 5
per cent discount to Thursday night's price being offset by a IPounds 1.15 a
share bid for Fyffes, the fruit wholesaler, and another half-point base rate
cut to 9 per cent.
Dealers noted that Fyffes promptly outpaced the bid price, closing at
IPounds 1.22 after IPounds 1.30, and that it took other food companies up
with it.
ISTANBUL continued its relentless drive higher, adding 5.3 per cent for a
weekly rise of 8.7 per cent. The market index rose 374.23 to 7,341.37,
firmly through the 7,000 level and establishing this month's eighth record
high.

FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo rally fails to change the
sceptics's minds - Emiko Terazono reports that serious doubts remain about
the recovery of the Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden rise of the Tokyo stock market in recent months has renewed
enthusiasm for stocks and increased the confidence of Japanese brokers.
The Nikkei average has risen by 20 per cent since the beginning of the year,
and volume has risen to levels reminiscent of the late 1980s bull market.
While the index corrected down 1.8 per cent to 20,297.86 yesterday, Japanese
brokers continue to cheer prices on.
The unexpected rally, however, leaves many investors still sceptical about
the recovery of Japan's economy, and has raised concerns about a resurgence
of asset inflation, seen in the days of loose credit in the late 1980s.
The change in investor sentiment was initially triggered by a wave of
government buying through public funds at the beginning of last month.
Foreigners were quick to respond to the rise, and a jump in Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, a benchmark for investor sentiment, fuelled further optimism.
Share prices received another boost earlier this week with the government's
Y13,200bn emergency economic package, and the Nikkei recovered the
psychologically important 20,000 level for the first time since March last
year.
Japanese brokers have been quick to point out that the stock price movements
reflect rational investor behaviour, and that share prices were reacting to
the bottoming out of the economy and future corporate profits. 'The economy
has hit the bottom and investors are discounting future earnings,' says Mr
Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities.
Indeed, some economic indicators have been encouraging. New car sales in
March rose 1.5 per cent after 14 consecutive months of decline. Money supply
expanded by a slim 0.2 per cent in February after a 0.3 per cent contraction
in January.
However consumer demand has yet to recover, as indicated by a 11.4 per cent
fall in March department store sales, the sharpest fall since the Japan
Department Store Association started collecting statistics in 1965. Capital
investment is still weak, and some economists are expecting last month's
money supply figures to indicate sluggish growth.
The speed of the market's rise against the mixed economic backdrop has
triggered concerns over a potential recurrence of the asset 'bubble' last
seen in the late 1980s. Low interest rates, a Y6,000bn emergency package,
and a higher yen triggered the sharp rise in asset prices in 1987. While
government officials point out that they are keeping a close watch, cynics
suggest that the Japanese authorities are now trying to counter the sluggish
economy by shoring up share prices.
Some analysts point out that the Japanese economy is closely linked to asset
prices. Since a rise in share prices will help Japanese companies and banks
by relieving them of losses on their stock portfolios, the rise in share
prices will help to increase the flow of funds into the economy.
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo reckons that a 15 per cent rise in the stock
market creates Y45,000bn of financial wealth. Thus, while the economy has
yet to recover, a sustained recovery in share prices may lead to an
improvement in economic fundamentals.
The emergency economic package may also help property prices. The package
includes a total Y1,600bn to be pumped into the property market through
advance land purchases for public works projects and increased funds for the
Housing Loan Corporation, which provides a third of all mortgages in Japan.
Brokers are already resuming the trading patterns seen in the late 1980s,
using 'themes' to sell stocks and whipping up market activity by rotating
trading from one sector to another. The big question is whether economy and
corporate earnings will catch up with the 'bubble' on the stock market,
which is currently trading at a price/earnings ratio of 74 times. Mr
Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, says the package will help
the economy, but adds that it will recycle existing cash rather than pump in
new funds.
Although Japanese brokers maintain a bullish stance, foreigners, who led the
recent rally, are starting to take a cautious stance as the index approaches
its forecast ceiling of 22,000. Technically, some analysts consider the
index overstretched at 17 per cent above its 200-day moving average of
17,200. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel says: 'Normally if the market is 11
to 13 per cent over the 200-day average, there is a correction.'
However, with more public funds waiting to be invested, a floor is expected
around the 19,500 level. The earnings reporting season in mid-May is
unlikely to bring big surprises and the focus will be on companies' profit
estimates for the current year to next March.
Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson says that unless the higher yen forces
the Bank of Japan to ease its monetary policy, the next few months may see
few events for investors to get excited about.
Meanwhile, smaller stocks have also recovered, with the over-the-counter
market yesterday closing at 1,581.67, up 44 per cent from its low in
November. Foreigners seeking exposure in Japan have been leading buyers;
investment trust funds have also actively purchased shares.
However, Mr Takehiro Tsuda, at Ichiyoshi Securities, a medium-sized
brokerage specialising in OTC stocks, says the index may be at a near-term
peak. 'The OTC index will face a correction to the 1,400 level ahead of the
March earnings announcement season.'

FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of recent currency shifts, arbitrage activity and analysts'
caution conspired to push down Reuters Holdings. The shares, already under
pressure, fell a further 25 to 1277p. At that level analysts said the stock
was well supported.
The shares are ex-dividend in the UK but not in the US and the disparity
between prices has prompted arbitraging which has forced the price down.
Also, UBS discussed the company at the morning meeting, particularly reports
that a broker had switched from Reuters new electronic trading system
Dealing 2000-2.
News that Hanson was returning to the acquisition trail added encouraged
further buying of the stock which added 1 1/4 at 233 3/4 p on heavy turnover
of 8.9m.
RTZ, the world's largest mining company, fell 10 1/2 to 647 1/2 p after
copper prices hit a five and a half year low.
SmithKline Beecham lifted 6 to 419p in the 'A's as a result of the
announcement late on Thursday that the company had settled its patent
dispute with Glaxo over the anti-nausea treatment ondansetron. The removal
of uncertainty was broadly positive for both companies but was unable to
counter the persistent selling pressure on Glaxo which ended the day a net 8
lower at 554p.
Transport and distribution group NFC shook off recent weakness after SG
Warburg turned buyers of the stock.
Pointing out that NFC had underperformed the market by 15 per cent over the
last quarter, Mr Andrew Fitchie at the securities house said NFC remained
attractive on fundamentals with good US and UK exposure. The shares rose 6
to 247p on turnover of 2.8m.
Shell Transport edged up 2 1/2 to 583 1/2 p with heavy turnover of 5.8m
shares said to have been stimulated by sizeable switching from Royal Dutch.
An early attempt at a rally in the regional electricity stocks (recs) and
the power generators prompted minor gains in the sectors but these were
mostly eroded as the wider market tumbled after the inflation numbers. One
securities houses was said to have been especially positive on the
generators, citing expectations of above average dividend growth.
All the utilities sectors have come under pressure this week as some
institutions have switched from the safer high-yielding areas of the market
into recovery stocks.
PowerGen was the most resilient, closing 3 up at 347 1/2 p. National Power
edged up 1 1/2 to 341 1/2 p.
Water stocks, which outperformed the market by 8 per cent during the first
quarter, remained out of favour. The Footsie stocks were given another
mauling, with Thames 13 off at 513p, North West 11 lower at 491p, Anglian
down 10 at 505p and Severn Trent down 11 at 491p.
SG Warburg continued to tell clients to reduce weightings. It says the
sector will underperform ahead of next summer's expected outcome of the
regulatory review. The water companies are expected to reveal capital
expenditure plans for the next five years later this month.
Irish-based fresh produce and foods group Fyffes jumped 23 to 123p, after it
said it had received an approach which might lead to a bid. Geest moved 4
ahead to 448p, in sympathy.
Bid speculation was once again heard in United Biscuits sending the shares 5
up at 389p.
Engineering and defence group Vickers hardened a penny to 132p as Robert
Fleming Securities yesterday reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock
predicting a recovery for Vickers on the back of a better performance from
its Rolls Royce cars subsidiary begining in 1994.
Investors appreciated the enhanced scrip alternative to the final dividend
offered by BICC and the shares jumped 13 to 358p.
In the rest of the transport sector, P&amp;O fell 15 to 547p, on suggestions
that James Capel had cut profit expectations.

FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo flounders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil exploration and production group Lasmo ended a difficult week under
renewed pressure. The shares closed 5 1/2 lower at 142 1/2 p, having
equalled the 1993 low of 141 1/2 p at one stage. Dealers said that the
sellers appeared on the scene after SG Warburg Securities lowered its net
asset value for the group, along with a general reappraisal on the
exploration production sub-sector.
Lasmo was the worst performer in the Footsie 100 index last month, falling
by more than 14 per cent after the troubled group slashed the final
dividend.
Dealers said the continued selling also reflected lingering worries that
Lasmo might lose its Footsie 100 status when the FT-SE Steering Committee
meets on June 9.

The continuing recovery of cyclical stocks was illustrated by the further
advance in British Steel. The shares gained another 4 to 94 3/4 p, having
touched 96p earlier in the day, as volume rose to a hefty 16m shares.
This week's strong performance of British Steel began on Thursday after SG
Warburg upgraded profit recommendations, and James Capel reiterated a buy
recommendation. Both said the recent price increases are likely to hold and
will thus prompt a recovery in the group's figures.
Other brokers remain cautious but several are expected to turn positive in
the next week or so.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that AT&amp;T, America's biggest telephone operator, intends to attack the
UK market focused attention on UK telecom operators BT and Cable &amp; Wireless
yesterday and sent both stocks lower in what some analysts considered a
knee-jerk reaction.
Many telecoms specialists were surprised to see BT shares slip 9 1/2 to 411p
on heavier than average turnover of 11m. They argued that as BT had already
applied to operate in the US it should have been no surprise that its US
counterpart would make a quid pro quo move. They added that AT&amp;T's proposals
posed a far greater threat to Cable's telecom subsidiary Mercury, which was
targeting the international market.
Cable shares fell 13 to 729p with 2.6m traded. The shares have performed
very well on the back of a strong Hong Kong market and several UK buy
recommendations. However, both stocks were further hit yesterday by the
shift away from recession defensive stocks to issues geared for recovery.

FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weaker gilts unsettle equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE improvement in market sentiment for much of the week all but disappeared
yesterday as dealers reacted strongly to extremely disappointing inflation
numbers as the long three-week Easter account drew to a close.
Already shortened by the Easter Monday bank holiday the week's trading was
severely disrupted by the second national railway strike in two weeks. Many
trading desks were badly affected by the industrial action but its was the
inflation statistics which took the heart out of the day's trading. 'The
market's appetite went out of the window with the inflation figures,'
commented the head of trading at one of the leading UK securities houses.
Equities took their cue from the gilts market where early minor falls
rapidly turned into substantial losses after the inflation details were
published.
The Footsie 100-index ended a thoroughly disappointing session 15.3 lower at
2,824.4, leaving the index only 2.4 higher on a week which provided strong
evidence in the form of increasing business confidence, rises in house
prices and an upturn in car sales, that the recovery in the UK economy is
well and truly underway
The session began quietly with dealers opening share prices marginally below
their overnight closing levels after a less than convincing performance by
Wall Street, which rallied after some hefty early falls. And London dealers
were unhappy at the steep decline on the Tokyo market.
Opening some 1.7 lower the Footsie 100 did little more than mark time until
the release of news that the underlying rate of inflation had risen to 3.5
per cent shook the market. It triggered a sharp sell off in gilts where the
longer dated stocks, down around an eighth of a point at the opening,
quickly went into reverse and eventually ended a busy session with losses
extending to just over a full point. Index-linked issues settled with falls
of around  5/8 .
The inflation numbers doused lingering hopes that UK interest rates could
move lower in the short-term. Sterling fell heavily against the dollar
although it was only marginally lower against the D-Mark.
The Footsie future immediately fell sharply as the inflation implications
filtered into The market, taking the cash market with it. At its worst the
Footsie 100 was down 22.6 at 2,817.1 with traders noting the appearance of
some large lines of stock.
A modestly firm opening by Wall Street helped steady the London market which
managed to recoup some of its earlier losses. Turnover was a creditable
586.7m shares.

THE release of worse than expected inflation figures led to a retreat in
stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The tentative start in trading of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at
2,853 was the first indication that a poor session lay ahead.
Sporadic buying in the first hour however saw it climb to 2,860 but this
soon ran out of steam leaving the contract to drift lower. The release of
disappointing inflation figures at 11.30am led to active selling which sent
June falling to 2,835.
By 3pm it had fallen to the days low of 2,819. However this proved a spur
for bargain hunters and it bounced to finish at 2,832, a fall of 57 on its
previous close and at a four-point discount to its estimated fair value
premium to cash of around 11. Volume improved to 7,434 lots.
Expiry of the April stock options was the main feature in the traded options
which saw total volume of 25,178 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was
10,223. United Biscuits was the busiest stock option.

FT  17 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Mixed fortunes for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR had mixed fortunes in the currency markets yesterday, showing
further strength against the D-Mark but weakening once more against the
Japanese yen, writes James Blitz.
Despite the lack of any fresh currency-related news in the European morning,
the dollar rose against the German currency, peaking at about DM1.6170.
The recent sell-off of the US currency has been strong enough to trigger
some short covering by dealers in recent days. At the same time, there were
growing expectations in the market yesterday that the Bundesbank might cut
rates at its council meeting next Thursday, narrowing the differential
between short term US and German rates which is capping the dollar's
progress.
However, the dollar eased off against the D-Mark at the end of the day,
partly as a result of lacklustre US economic indicators. The Michigan
university consumer confidence index raised new fears about the pace of
economic recovery, falling to 84.0 per cent in April from 85.9 per cent in
March. The market had been looking for a small rise.
The US currency later closed in London at DM1.6135 from a previous DM1.6025.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes
that the Bundesbank could ease rates on Thursday. Much will depend on the
figures for M3 money supply growth which are due out next week. 'If these
prove to be on the weak side, the Bundesbank might lean towards easing
again,' he said.
By contrast, the dollar was very weak against a yen that strengthened across
the board.
The main concern in the market was that neither President Bill Clinton of
the US nor Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, would register
any concern about the strong yen at their meeting yesterday.
Although the Japanese authorities announced a large fiscal stimulus to the
economy this week, Clinton administration officials appeared sufficiently
concerned by the Japanese trade surplus to want to see the yen rise further.
There were also signs yesterday that the Japanese are not too perturbed by
their currency's progress. The head of research of the ruling LDP party in
Japan said that Japanese exporters would not feel any pain from the
yen/dollar rate until it reached the Y110 level.
All this helped to boost the yen to a close of Y112.60 against the dollar in
London from a previous Y113.20. The Japanese currency also performed very
strongly against the D-Mark closing at Y69.75 from a previous Y70.62.

FT  17 APR 93 / Money Markets: UK futures tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a sharp change of mood in both the sterling cash and futures
markets yesterday, with dealers taking the view that UK base rates could
soon be on an upward trend, writes James Blitz.
On the futures market, there was a substantial sell-off in the June and
Septmber sterling contracts following the announcement that the headline
figure for inflation in March had risen to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent
year-on-year.
The unexpected rise in the data raised speculation that the UK authorities
might have to tighten monetary policy if inflation were to remain within the
government's target range.
The data also came at the end of a week which has seen a raft of indicators
suggesting that the UK economy is in the midst of an unswing, and that
another cut in base rates might not be needed.
Compounding the change of mood was the Bank of England's announcement
yesterday that it will set another gilt auction on April 28. This may mean
there is a drain on liquidity at the end of the month, bringing tighter
money market conditions and rates.
All these factors created a strong view in the market that 6 per cent may
mark the bottom for UK rates in this cycle. Last night, there was a clear
upward sloping yield curve in both the cash and futures markets for the
first time this year.
The strongest reaction to the RPI data came in the futures market, where the
June contract fell 14 basis points to bottom out at 93.92. It later closed
at 93.94, pricing 3-month money in June at 6.04 per cent.
There was an even stronger reaction in the March 1994 contract, which lost
44 basis points on the day to close at 93.60.
Cash rates firmed sharply in the wake of the figures with 3-month money
closing up more than  1/16 per cent at 6 1/16 per cent. One year money moved
up even more sharply at 6 3/16 per cent from a previous 5 7/8 per cent.
Despite the stark change of mood, some dealers expressed the view that the
market had heavily over-reacted.
One dealer pointed to more UK economic data due out next week, including
unemployment figures and retail sales figures for March. 'The market will
retrace this latest move if these point out any sluggishness in the UK
economy,' he said.

FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: First Chicago lifts profits to
Dollars 179m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST CHICAGO, the mid-western US bank with Dollars 48.5bn of assets,
yesterday unveiled first-quarter 1993 net profit of Dollars 179.1m (Dollars
1.97 per share), up significantly from the Dollars 86.8m (Dollars 1.08)
earned a year ago.
The first-quarter comparison is based on stripping out an extraordinary
accounting gain a year ago that resulted from the valuation of venture
capital investment securities.
Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said core earnings were improving and noted
that the burden of bad debts was decreasing as revenues increased.
First Chicago also said it had entered an agreement with GE Capital during
the quarter, under which it would sell up to Dollars 1bn of real estate
loans for about Dollars 500m.
Non-performing assets declined by 9 per cent to Dollars 377m during the
first three months of 1993, while bad debt provisions were 44 per cent lower
year-on-year at Dollars 65m.
Net write-offs were Dollars 74m, of which commercial write-offs accounted
for Dollars 46m and consumer write-offs Dollars 28m.
Non-interest income rose by 29 per cent to Dollars 490.5m, while net
interest income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 305m.
First Chicago strengthened its capital position by issuing Dollars 200m of
convertible preferred stock.
The bank's Tier One risk-adjusted capital ratio - the ratio of capital to
assets used by US regulators - stood at a healthy 7.7 per cent as at March
31.
On Wall Street, First Chicago's share price declined by Dollars  1/4 to
close at Dollars 43 5/8.

FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Gambro rights issue aims to fund
expansion

<TEXT>
GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, has announced plans for a
SKr424m (Dollars 57m) rights issue to strengthen its capital base and fund
further expansion.
The company is to issue 1.84m new shares at SKr230 a share, which is 33 per
cent below the current stock market level of SKr345. The move will boost its
share capital by SKr36m from SKr547m.
Mr Jan Gustavsson, chief financial officer, said the group had no specific
acquisition target in mind, but was looking to ensure it had adequate
strength to continue the expansion that has seen it buy a number of
companies in the US and Europe over the last five years.
The group's current equity-assets ratio is just above 30 per cent.
For 1992, Gambro disclosed a 27 per cent increase in profits to SKr753m and
raised its dividend 20 per cent to SKr4.50 per share.
The company's two largest shareholders in terms of voting power - Cardo,
which holds 58.4 per cent of Gambro's votes, and the Crafoord Foundation,
which has 11.3 per cent - have both said they would fully take up their
preferential rights under the issue.
The company's A-shares, which have 10 times the voting power of the
B-shares, are being offered on a one-for-five basis, and the B-shares at a
one-for-15 ratio.

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier which is integrating
operations with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, is offering to buy USAir's
Baltimore-London route for Dollars 5m. Northwest said that it would then
seek government approval to switch the route to Detroit-London.
The US carrier has long fought to obtain a route between London and Detroit,
where it has a large hub. However, the bilateral aviation agreement between
the US and the UK permits only one non-stop authority between London and
Detroit, which is held by Delta Air Lines.
A US bankruptcy court judge has approved the reorganisation plan put forward
by Continental Airlines, meaning that the fifth-largest US carrier is poised
to emerge from bankruptcy. As part of Continental's re-emergence, Air Canada
and a Texan investment partnership are investing in the US carrier, in
return for minority stakes. Continental went into bankruptcy - for the
second time in its history - in 1990.

next week

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to restructure financially Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance
group which collapsed last August, is expected soon following a breakthrough
in negotiations between creditors and potential investors.
A choice is expected to be made next week between two proposals.
The collapse followed Uni's NKr4.7bn (Dollars 692m) acquisition of a 28.3
per cent stake in Skandia Forsakring, Sweden's biggest insurer, financed
through short-term loans. A joint bid for the Swedish group with fellow
insurer Hafnia failed, and the value of Uni's stake more than halved when
Skandia's share price plunged. Uni's creditors called in their loans and the
insurer was unable to pay.
One proposal calls for a foreign investor to take a significant stake in
Uni. Last month Norwegian authorities cleared the way for such a solution by
expanding the allowance for foreign ownership in domestic financial
institutions to 33 1/3 per cent from 10 per cent.
Sources close to Uni said yesterday that a large French insurer has been
undertaking a due diligence process over the past few months with a view to
taking a stake in Uni.
The other solution, due to be presented soon to Uni's administration board
by two domestic brokerage firms, calls for a share issue to raise up to
NKr2.8bn.

Reuter reports from Milan.
The group will offer one ordinary share for every four ordinary or savings

average price on the Milan bourse of L3,838 per share in the first quarter
of this year. The shares closed yesterday at L3,979.
The rights issue is subject to shareholder approval.
Pirelli &amp; Co also reported a preliminary loss of L125.6bn in 1992, against a

GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was taken over in
1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday reported an impressive jump
in 1993 first-quarter net income to Dollars 14.3m - more than four times the
level of a year ago.
The profits, which translate into earnings per share of 12 cents against
three cents a year ago, were struck on revenues of Dollars 153m, up from
Dollars 129m in the same quarter of 1992. Higher product sales, royalty
income and contract revenues contributed to the 19 per cent increase in
turnover.
Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said that while the results
were very good, it was 'even more important' that the company had filed for
approval to market Pulmozyme, a new cystic fibrosis drug, in the US, Europe
and Canada.
Pulmozyme is claimed to reduce the rate of respiratory infection and improve
lung functioning in patients. Mr Raab noted that as recently as five years
ago the drug was merely a 'scientific idea'.
In line with Genentech's heavy investment in research and development,
first-quarter R&amp;D expenses were Dollars 74.2m, up from Dollars 66m in the
first quarter of 1992.
The R&amp;D spending represented 48 per cent of total revenues in the quarter.
Sales of Protropin, a human growth hormone, increased by 8 per cent to
Dollars 52.2m. Sales of Activase t-PA, a heart attack drug, were 11 per cent
higher at Dollars 49.2m.
Genentech also said it had begun Phase II trials of a genetically-engineered
treatment drug for patients infected with the HIV virus.
On Wall Street, where biotechnology stocks have suffered along with other
drugs stocks amid concern about the Clinton administration's plans for
healthcare reform, Genentech's share price declined by Dollars  1/2
yesterday to Dollars 33 5/8 before the close.

FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Desperate days in Daf's demise -
Kevin Done charts the final months of the Dutch truck maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE waters closed over Daf at the end of January, the troubled Dutch
commercial vehicle maker had finally begun to achieve an operating profit on
its core operations.
The signs of a tentative recovery provided cold comfort to the hapless
holders of the now worthless shares in old Daf (Daf NV), however, at
Thursday's emotional, six-hour shareholders' meeting.
Mr Cor Baan, formerly chief executive of old Daf and now chief executive of
the reborn Daf Trucks, tried to justify past management actions. 'The
question everyone is asking themselves . . . is, how could Daf get into this
state? We are convinced that we did everything possible to guide Daf through
the difficult period.'
Daf filed for protection from its creditors in The Netherlands on February
2. Leyland Daf, its UK subsidiary, went into administrative receivership a
day later.
Mr Baan drew back the veil from the intractable problems that confronted the
increasingly desperate Daf management, as it battled last year to stave off
collapse. For the first time, he disclosed:
the extent of Daf's mismanagement of its finance subsidiary, which by the
end of 1991 had landed itself with a debilitating mismatch of long-term
loans financed by short-term funding;
that Daf had planned to close its van operations at Birmingham in an attempt
to rescue the rest of the business (the UK van operation, now close to a
management buy-out, has actually been saved by Daf's financial collapse);
he implicitly accepted that Daf management had been misled by its ambition
to match its much bigger competitors, such as Mercedes-Benz and Iveco
(Fiat), in continuing to develop and renew its entire truck range without a
strategic partner, in spite of Daf's much smaller sales and production
volumes; he expressed regret that Daf had agreed to take over British
Leyland's van operations (Freight Rover), when it also acquired Leyland's
truck operations in 1987.
'The whole of 1992 was marked by a difficult and time-consuming process
concerning short and long-term financing,' said Mr Baan.
He revealed that Daf's banking consortium had already sought collateral for
their loans at the start of 1992, as the company was failing to meet some of
the ratios stipulated in its loan agreements.
'The financial situation throughout the second half of 1992 was such that
discussions took place with the banking consortium virtually every month
concerning an extension of the bank facility agreement,' he said.
Mr Baan disclosed that it was the banks that had finally forced the company
to find a deal that would force it to give up its independence. The banking
consortium set the condition in its facility agreement in June 1992 that Daf
should enter 'co-operation with a financially strong partner' as quickly as
possible, he said.
The prime candidate for a partner was Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's
biggest truck maker. The Dutch group's bankers insisted that Mercedes-Benz
should be persuaded to take an equity stake in Daf, however, which the Dutch
company's managers found difficult to bear.
Mr Baan said that Daf also held exploratory discussions with Hino of Japan
and Cummins, the US engine manufacturer, but 'no longer-term structural
solution was offered'.
By October 1992, with no progress on the Mercedes-Benz alliance, the company
had begun to formulate 'a new, accelerated and far-reaching plan for
reorganisation'. The earlier action plan Operations 92/93, implemented only
10 months before, had already become 'completely inadequate', admitted Mr
Baan.
By the end of January this year, Daf planned:
to cut another 4,000 jobs, or a third of its workforce (the payroll had
already fallen from 16,782 in 1989 to 12,289 in 1992);
to cut the management board from six to four, and to halve the corporate
staff to 75;
to end van production in Birmingham, which employed 2,000, and to pull out
of a project with Renault to develop a new generation of vans; to sell the
Daf Finance subsidiary 'as soon as possible'.
This drastic restructuring was expected to cause an extraordinary charge of
Fl 700m (Dollars 389m), which would have wiped out the group's entire Fl
458m equity.
Mr Baan revealed that the deep-rooted problems of Daf Finance meant that for
the whole of 1992 the group was forced to operate without a captive finance
company.
The slide in Daf Finance's fortunes meant that financiers were no longer
willing to provide long-term funds, so expiring long-term borrowings had to
be converted into short-term debt. In 1991, 56 per cent of Daf Finance's Fl
1.3bn portfolio of long-term loans was funded by short-term debt.
As funding to Daf Finance dried up, the group's liquidity problems
intensified. Mr Baan admitted that in late-1991 and early-1992, Daf 'was
already considering stopping the financing activities entirely, but it was
not deemed advisable to signal this to the market'.
Daf could wait no longer. Mr Baan said that sales financing was
substantially reduced from mid-1992 and 'finally completely stopped'. Daf
Finance made a loss of Fl 130m last year, including a Fl 95m charge to
facilitate its disposal.
Daf Finance's balance sheet had mushroomed from Fl 849m in 1986 to Fl 2.66bn
in 1991. Mr Baan insisted, however, that 'conclusions suggesting that Daf
bought market shares through the finance company and that the company
attracted customers who by definition can be regarded as being in the
category of doubtful debtors are absolutely incorrect.'

FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Dutch group to resume dividend
payments

<TEXT>
INTERNATIO-MULLER, the Dutch trading and technical installation group, is to
resume dividend payments for the first time since 1989 after swinging back
into profit in 1992 following substantial losses in 1991.
The company, which has divested 40 companies over the past two years as part
of a strategy of refocusing on its core businesses, said it posted a net
profit of Fl 30.1m (Dollars 16.7m) in 1992.
This marks a significant improvement from the losses of Fl 121.3m suffered a
year earlier, when charges of Fl 92.4m were incurred for book losses and
reorganisation costs. In 1992, charges fell to just Fl 7.2m.
Internatio-Muller said it intended to pay a dividend of Fl 1 a share over
1992 results, compared with its last pay-out of Fl 3.60 per share over 1989
results.
Sales fell by nearly 10 per cent to Fl 2.8bn last year, mainly as a result
of divestments and deconsolidations. In the two years since it began its
divestment drive, Internatio-Muller has sold off businesses which generated
a total of Fl 700m in sales.
Operating results, excluding extraordinary charges, swung into a profit of
Fl 43m from a loss of Fl 25.2m a year earlier.

FT  17 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African riots push up
platinum - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL DISTURBANCES in South Africa following the killing of black leader
Chris Hani produced strong reverberations in the platinum market this week.
South Africa accounts for about two-thirds of western world platinum
supplies so the market is particularly sensitive to the prospect of
escalating unrest in that country. An erratic rise saw the New York
Mercantile Exchange's July futures position touch Dollars 374 a troy ounce
at one point, the highest since December, but in late trading yesterday it
was quoted at Dollars 371.90 an ounce, up Dollars 13.10 on the week.
Analysts say Dollars 373.50 an ounce remains a strong resistance level and
that a break above Dollars 375 is needed to trigger a sharp rise. Dealers
will be watching Mr Hani's funeral on Monday for indications as to whether
tensions in South Africa are likely to intensify or relax in the near
future.
At the London Metal Exchange sentiment was dominated by the continued slide
in copper prices to fresh 5 1/2 -year lows. Following the heavy pre-Easter
fall a recovery was attempted on Tuesday. But that proved short-lived and by
Thursday's close the psychologically-important Dollars 2,000-a-tonne level
had been breached. Overnight selling in the Far East set the tone for
yesterday's opening and stop-loss and options-related selling quickly pushed
the three months delivery price to Dollars 1,877 a tonne. By the close the
price had recovered to Dollars 1,903 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 113
down on the week.
Mr William Adams of LME trader Rudolf Wolff said yesterday that the copper
market was very over-sold but suggested that the price was likely to remain
volatile because of options-related activity. The latest falls, which took
losses over the past ten days to Dollars 270 a tonne, or 12.5 per cent,
seemed to have been partly influenced by panic selling, he said. 'Copper
hasn't been down here since October 87. . . it is running off the charts.'
The price was now close to break-even level for some of the higher cost
producers, Mr Adams pointed out. But he did not expect to see production
cuts yet as 'people are still making profits'. Producers would not begin to
scale down output until the market price was well below costs, Mr Adams
said, 'and producers have to believe that it is going to stay there'.
Copper's weakness affected sentiment in the other LME contracts. Nickel was
particularly weak with the three months price slipping Dollars 235 to a
10-week low of Dollars 5,840 a tonne at one point after the breaching of the
Dollars 6,000-a-tonne support level triggered the operation of stop-loss
selling orders and commission house and merchant selling. The price rallied
yesterday, however, and broke through resistance at Dollars 5,900 a tonne to
close at Dollars 5,397.50 a tonne, up Dollars 90 on the day and Dollars
137.50 down on the week.
The zinc market began the week in a relatively buoyant mood as chart-based
resistance around Dollars 1,030 a tonne for three months metal was overcome
and investment fund short-covering was triggered. There was also talk of
production cuts in Pacific Rim countries, though this remained unconfirmed.
Overhead resistance appeared at Dollars 1,050 a tonne, however, and
disappointment at the modest scale of Chinese production cuts helped to push
prices lower. The three months zinc price closed yesterday at Dollars
1,025.75 a tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day and up a mere Dollars 7.75 on
the week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices regained
some more of their lost ground but once again ran into resistance as the
Dollars 900-a-tonne level for the July contract was approached. The price
reached Dollars 885 a tonne on Thursday but slipped back yesterday to
Dollars 876, up Dollars 27 on the week. Dealers were encouraged,
nevertheless, by signs that the coffee market was building a solid base and
suggested that the break-out from the present range, when it came, was
likely to be on the up-side.
The collapse at the end of last month of attempts to renegotiate a
price-supporting International Coffee Agreement seems to have done the
market little harm. In fact it may have helped sentiment by removing any
lingering uncertainty about the prospects for a new pact.
Producing countries are not yet ready to abandon all hope, however.
Officials of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation told the Reuter news
agency yesterday that ministers from Africa's 10 main coffee nations,
including Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Zaire, were expected to
attend a meeting in the Ivory Coast on April 26-27 to consider their next
step after the failure of the pact talks.
Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivorian commodities minister and the current IACO
chairman, said last week that African countries wanted to try to revive the
negotiations in a desperate bid to force up languishing world prices which
have crippled poor producers. He explained that the Abidjan meeting would
examine new proposals to be put to a session of the International Coffee
Organisation's 16-member executive board in London on April 28-30.
Sugar prices continued their retreat from recent highs this week but
analysts were suggesting after a modest bounce yesterday that the 'rout'
might be over. The July futures position in New York was quoted at 11.12
cents a lb, up 0.12 on the day but down 0.36 on the week.

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat replaced by Norcros in FT-SE
Mid 250
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS Moat Houses, the hotel company the shares of which were suspended
last month amid financial difficulties, was yesterday removed from the FT-SE
Mid 250 and replaced by Norcros, building products and packaging group.
Under rules introduced last year, Queens Moat was withdrawn from the index
after yesterday's close at a nominal share price of 1p compared to its
suspension price of 47 1/2 p.
Although this leads to falls in the value of the FT-SE Mid 250, the
FT-Actuaries All Share and other indices, the new rules are designed to be
more realistic.
In the past, shares were withdrawn from the FT-SE 100 at their suspension
price, which few shares could match if and when trading resumed.
This meant it was often impossible for fund managers to match the
performance of the index.
The following is the full text of the statement issued by the FT-SE
Actuaries UK Indices Committee after the stock market closed yesterday:
'The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee has today approved, following the
suspension of shares in Queens Moat Houses on March 31 1993, that Queens
Moat Houses be removed from the FT-SE Mid 250 at a nominal price of 1p and
replaced by Norcros after close of business today.
'The removal of Queens Moat Houses has been made in accordance with Rules
7.4.2 and 7.4.3 of the Ground Rules for the Management of the FT-SE
Actuaries Share Indices. Rule 7.4.3 allows for a suspended constituent which
subsequently restores its quotation to be reinstated at the value at which
it was removed (eg, 1p).
'Norcros will be promoted to the FT-SE Mid 250 from the FT-SE SmallCap.
'No replacement company will be included in the FT-SE SmallCap.
'The removal of Queens Moat Houses from the FT-SE Mid 250 will result in the
following adjustments to the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices after today's close:
FT-SE Mid 250: -10.47 index points;
FT-SE Actuaries 350: -1.05 index points
FT-SE-A 350 Hotels &amp; Leisure Industry Basket: -48.97 index points.
FT-Actuaries All-Share: -1 index point;
FT-A All-Share Hotels &amp; Leisure sector: -40.9 index points.'

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Vardon moves into bingo with Pounds 9m buys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARDON, the acquisitive leisure company which owns the London Dungeon, is
moving into bingo with the purchase of 12 clubs for up to Pounds 9m.
Vardon, which was listed last October, will fund the acquisitions through a
placing and open offer at 72p a share to raise Pounds 13.5m. The shares
added 1p to 79p.
Mr Nick Irens, chief executive, said bingo would broaden Vardon's base away
from seasonal businesses. As well as the London and York Dungeons, Vardon
also owns Sea Life Centres and a seal sanctuary, all of which rely on summer
turnover.
He added that there were also growth opportunities as new, edge-of-town
sites were developed to compete with existing facilities. The extra money
raised in the placing would be used to build new clubs.
Vardon is buying Ritz, a private company which owns three clubs and is about
to open a fourth, and Lion Leisure, a subsidiary of Wembley, which operates
seven clubs. Both companies were profitable in their latest financial year.
The open offer, underwritten by SG Warburg, is on a 2-for-5 basis.
Causeway Smaller Quoted Companies Fund, one of Vardon's largest
shareholders, has sold its 12.5 per cent stake, which was placed by Warburg.
Mr David Hudd, Vardon's chairman, said Causeway invested in Vardon at 45p
and had decided to take its profits.

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hanson pays Dollars 116m for US
housebuilder - Deal is part of strategy for bolt-on acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON INDUSTRIES, the American arm of the Anglo-UK conglomerate, is
expanding its property interests with a Dollars 116m (Pounds 75.5m) purchase
of a residential housebuilder with assets in California, Arizona and Nevada.
Beazer Homes Inc, an affiliate of Hanson Industries, is buying the assets
from Watt Housing Corporation.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, said: 'The
acquisition of Watt Housing at an appropriate time in the homebuilding
economic cycle, further expands Hanson's operations in building materials'.
The move is also part of Hanson Industries' strategy of buying bolt-on
acquisitions to existing core businesses. Mr Clarke said recently it was
part of 'a continuing programme ofexpanding Hanson's core businesses'.
After being in recession for five years since the end of 1986, the building
industry is recovering with new work rising by 3.5 per cent last year.
NatWest Securities estimates that it will rise by 5 per cent this year and
that the recovery should continue at least until 1995, when total work in
place will be more than 15 per cent higher than it is today.
California remains the weakest state, and NatWest Securities believes it
will continue to underperform the rest of the US for another two years.
Mr Martin Taylor, Hanson's vice chairman, said: 'You would expect us to take
that into consideration when we did our due diligence and decided on what
price we would pay for the assets'.
Last year Beazer Homes sold 1,182 homes in the south-east of the US. Beazer
Homes Limited, the UK's third largest homebuilder, sold 4,948 houses.
Combined Beazer sales for the US and UK homebuilding operations in 1992 were
Dollars 602m with pre-tax profits of Dollars 80m.

As part of its strategy of concentrating on its core activities, HTV, the
independent television company for Wales and the west country, has reached
conditional agreement to dispose of Cordmate Investments, poster planning
and buying agency.
Alban Securities, which has been formed by a management team supported by an
institutional investor, will pay Pounds 2.2m cash on completion of the sale.
However, HTV is required to repay certain inter-company balances which will
reduce the sale proceeds to about Pounds 500,000.
In 1992 Cordmate, which is a holding company for three subsidiaries:
Concord, Alban and Cordmate, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 426,000. At the
end of December net assets amounted to Pounds 1.9m.
An extraordinary general meeting is to take place on May 4 to seek

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wharfedale restructure hits Verity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS AT Wharfedale Loudspeakers, which were more intransigent and deep
rooted than earlier thought, were the main reason behind continuing pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1.54m at Verity Group in the six months to December 31,
against Pounds 1.71m.
In addition the expected launch of the car alarm was delayed due to design
and licensing problems.
On turnover of Pounds 6.84m (Pounds 4.75m) the USM-quoted electronics
products producer incurred operating losses 69 per cent higher at Pounds
1.01m (Pounds 597,000). The figures included a contribution from the Mission
companies from their acquisition in October which contributed turnover of
Pounds 3.13m.
Net interest payable was Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 299,000) and there were
exceptional charges of Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 809,000) relating to costs of
reorganising Wharfedale. Further costs of Pounds 750,000 are expected in the
second half.
The figures are produced in accordance with FRS 3. Last year's reported
interim pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.34m.
On prospects Sir Gordon Brunton, chairman, said that the board was confident
the problems at Wharfedale had been largely resolved and in the third
quarter the core audio business was trading profitably at the operating
level.
Losses per share came out at 2.2p (7.7p).

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dublin nets IPounds 104m in sale of Irish
Life shares
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has disposed of just over half of its remaining 33.6
per cent stake in Irish Life, the largest fund manager in the Irish
Republic, for a total of IPounds 104m.
The 55m shares were sold at IPounds 1.90 a share, to 'a large number of
institutional investors, both domestic and foreign' according to the finance
department.
Two thirds went to Irish investors. Market analysts said the government
chose a good moment to sell. The price realised represented only a 5 per
cent discount on the last traded price.
Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, said at the time of the budget last
January, that the government intended to raise some IPounds 150m this year
by selling off part of its remnant shareholdings in the former state-run
companies Greencore and Irish Life, which were both privatised in 1991. The
hangover of the government shareholding has tended to depress the price of
both stocks.
Irish Life said it was pleased at the broadening of its shareholder base and
particularly encouraged by the overseas interest in Irish Life stock.
Government efforts to sell its 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, a sugar,
milling and malting concern, have not progressed so smoothly, however.
Interest has been shown by ADM, the US food conglomerate, but fears over
losing control of the Irish sugar quota to a foreign company have fuelled
political opposition to the sale, forcing the government last month to open
the sale to tender with the intention of encouraging a bid by Irish food
companies. None came forward however, and ADM is now playing hard-to-get,
presumably with a view to beating the government down on an earlier offer of
IPounds 2.60 a share.

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: A pan-European pipe-dream come true - Delta
has seized upon the opportunities presented by the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF A company could treat the single market like a blank canvas, it would be
easy to establish a pan-European business.
In manufacturing, the company could site its factories according to wage and
skill levels to give the lowest production costs; in marketing it could
promote a single brand and corporate name; in management it could be
cosmopolitan, making it easy to spread best practice through the group.
Delta, the UK electrical cables and engineering concern, has tried to follow
such guidelines in building up a pan-European business for copper-alloy
plumbing fittings.
It started with a small UK subsidiary, manufacturing in Birmingham and
Dundee. The home market was, however, mature as the vast majority of
domestic sanitary and heating systems had already been converted from
galvanised iron to copper.
Continental Europe held much more potential, with only half the old systems
converted in the west and plenty of virgin territory in the east.
Delta decided that the market offered enough scope for a Europe-wide
approach in spite of local variations - in pipe diameters for instance  -
and local loyalties to companies and brands.
The first step came in 1987 with the acquisition of NIBCO Europe from a US
group, bringing in German, French and Spanish subsidiaries.
After a total investment of about Pounds 55m, IBP - the name adopted for the
Europe-wide business - has factories in five countries and a marketing and
distribution network extending to about 20. Sales have doubled since the
original NIBCO purchase.
IBP accounts for nearly half of Delta's engineering division, the group's
biggest operating profit earner in 1992 with Pounds 22.2m on sales of Pounds
320.1m.
The NIBCO deal brought in two key executives: IBP's managing director, Mr
Rudi Brodkorb, a German, part of whose education was in France, and the
production director, Mr Luis Adarraga, also MD of ATCOSA in Spain, whose
family has worked in copper for two generations.
Their first aim has been to reduce production costs. The idea is to make
low-volume items in areas with lower labour costs, such as Spain and Poland,
while the emphasis in Germany is on high volumes and automation.
When you look at the data on labour, however, 550 of the near 1,200
employees are in Germany. This is partly because it is the biggest market
and partly historic. With NIBCO, Delta inherited a copper pipe factory,
which supplies a third of in-house needs, a red-brass facility (for threaded
components) and a foundry.
Mr Brodkorb acknowledges that if the group were starting from scratch it
would not locate a foundry in Germany. But the planning barriers to building
one elsewhere are prohibitive.
In ATCOSA's factory in Cordoba, southern Spain, 800 different products are
made - although 26 of them account for 75 per cent of the volume.
Some product lines have been transferred to this plant to take advantage of
lower labour costs, but such moves are always accompanied by an effort to
improve the process. 'We develop a more automated system to deal with a
future problem of higher wages,' Mr Adarraga says.
Typical improvements are to knock two procedures into one and to find ways
of saving material - the next highest cost after labour. For instance the
Cordoba factory has developed a method of making an 'elbow' joint that
simplifies the cutting process and saves copper in the pipe walls.
Such advances can be extended to other areas of the group. But it would be
wrong to attribute much of the momentum to the single market. International
competition and customer demands for flexibility of supply are the driving
forces.
On the marketing side, the promotional effort operates on three levels. The
bulk of the products, wherever they are on sale in Europe, come under the B
brand. This means the customer does not know where they are produced.
Mr Brodkorb says that transportation costs are relatively small. Here the
single market has saved time and paperwork.
However, it has yet to provide a common set of standards. These are supposed
to be hammered out by 1994, but Mr Brodkorb is pessimistic about the
timetable because national quality standards are still being generated,
effectively forming barriers to entry.
The next level of branding is the subsidiary name. Here IBP has respected
the local loyalties of customers - typically regional plumbing wholesalers -
and kept historic names. Finally the pan-European banner is promoted via the
IBP prefix.
Product prices are an important part of the marketing equation. Before
Britain left the ERM, a big effort had been made to bring prices into line.
Mr Brodkorb says the variation had been reduced to 7 per cent, which
minimised the incen-tive for cross-border under-cutting. The pound's
devaluation has severely disrupted this effort.
With both manufacturing and marketing presenting a cross between
single-market values and historic national constraints, the third ideal of
having a cosmopolitan management might seem harder to achieve.
However, the IBP board is surprisingly international. The managing and
marketing directors are German, the production director Spanish, and the
finance director English. Product development and purchasing is split
between English and French directors.
The benefits of the cosmopolitan approach are the exchange of ideas and
technology, and the overview that informs the endless process of
rationalisation.
This was put to the test when IBP took over Atub in Normandy in 1990.
Changes had to be made to both management and technology. But Atub insisted
that one of its processes was the best. As a PR exercise initially, IBP
decided to hear them out. It turned out that Atub was right, and now some of
its technology is being spread through the group.
As IBP extends its ambitions, both geographically and in terms of product
range, that open-mindedness will increasingly be called upon to ease the
tension between European goals and specific regional situations.

FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enhanced scrip from BICC - Companies hope
to attract increased take-up and make ACT savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and constr-uction group, yesterday joined the lengthening
list of companies offering an enhanced scrip dividend. However, analysts
believe that most companies for which the scheme has attractions, have by
now decided whether or not to pursue them.
Like other companies which have introduced enhanced scrip dividends in
recent weeks - BAT Industries, RTZ, Coats Viyella, Ladbroke, Forte and
Redland - BICC will offer shareholders a 50 per cent higher dividend in
shares as an alternative to its final cash dividend for 1992.
The net final dividend proposed was 13.25p, the scrip alternative is
19.875p.
BZW, the stockbroker, is offering to buy any shares issued to shareholders
who take up the scrip offer, at a price of 18.875p, free of commissions.
The scheme enables companies to cut their advance corporation tax bills, as
ACT is not payable on scrip dividends, and is beneficial for groups which
are paying more ACT than they can offset against mainstream corporation tax.
However, changes to the ACT regime announced in last month's budget are
expected to make the scheme redundant.
If they take up the scrip offer, tax exempt shareholders who normally
reclaim ACT on dividends, would not receive a tax credit but this would be
more than offset by the higher dividend. Tax-paying shareholders would be
better off, although the extent of the gain depends on individual tax
positions.
Companies therefore hope for a much higher take-up of the offer than is
usual with ordinary scrip dividends, which are rarely accepted by more than
5 per cent of shareholders.
Mr Ron Henderson, finance director of BICC, said earnings per share would be
increased by 1.5p in 1993 if there was a 50 per cent take-up of the scrip
offer. BICC's 1992 earnings per share were 20.2p before exceptional charges.
Full take-up would result in a 5.4 per cent increase in the group's share
capital.
Mr Henderson said the group had about Pounds 30m of surplus ACT and the
final dividend would have required an ACT payment of between Pounds 12m and
Pounds 13m.
He said the group would use the cash retained, which could total Pounds 28m,
to reduce gearing. Mr Henderson said the money would not be used for a
specific project but that the group would continue to invest in its
continental European and North American cable operations.

FT  17 APR 93 / Computers that put the 'face' into interface: A race to
apply the personal touch to the world of information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be someone new in your future.
You will be able to choose the appearance, name and personality of this new
companion and nobody, not even your spouse, should raise any objections,
even if you take it home with you.
This 'person', who you may be spending many hours with, will be a computer
'agent', an electronically created personality that acts as your personal
assistant; arranging meetings, finding information, making travel
arrangements and reminding you that it is time to pay the phone bill, get
the car serviced or send a birthday card to your mother.
And when you are tired after a long day at work, you can look forward to
coming home to find that he or she has recorded television programmes
selected to match your tastes and ordered your favourite dinner to be
delivered.
It may sound too good to be true. But not if the visions of some of the
world's largest computer and telecommunications companies are realised. By
2000, the 'personal' in personal computing could take on a very different
meaning.
Making computers companionable will require some big advances in
semiconductor, communications and computer software, but already the
electronics industry is moving forward rapidly on several fronts.
International Business Machines, for example, has several projects under way
to develop what it calls 'human interfaces' for computers; speech
recognition technology that will enable a computer to comprehend spoken
commands and visualisation techniques that could be used to give the
computer a human-like 'face'.
IBM recently demonstrated this technology by creating a computer-version of
its vice-chairman, Mr Jack Kuehler, who engaged in a mock conversation with
his computer-simulated image.
Apple Computer is also in the forefront of making computers more 'user
friendly'. This year it will launch its first 'Newton' product, which it
calls a 'personal digital assistant', a pocket-sized device that can be used
to send hand-written messages electronically and keep track of your personal
diary and notes.
Competing with Apple is a group of companies including AT&amp;T, Matsushita of
Japan, and Olivetti of Japan, which is backing EO, a Silicon Valley venture
that has launched a 'personal communicator' a device that combines a
computer and a cellular telephone. Wireless communications systems that
extend cellular technology to allow electronic handsets to send or retrieve
messages 'anytime, anywhere' are a critical element of this new world. So
too is digital technology which converts electronic signals into binary
codes.
Digital systems store a much larger amount of data than existing analogue
systems and process the data much more quickly.
Motorola, one of the leaders in communications technology, has formed an
international alliance with telecommunications companies from the US, Europe
and Asia to help fund Iridium, an ambitious Dollars 3.8bn satellite system
that would provide global wireless communications. In the US, Ardis and Ram
Mobile Data are building competing national wireless data networks. Such
wireless networks could free office workers from their telephones and
facsimile machines and enable them to take their work with them wherever
they care to go.
Yet if you see yourself conducting business while basking on the beach of
some remote island, keep in mind that in the future you may not want to
stray too far from an 'information superhighway'; a fibre optic cable that
can transmit video signals as well as voice and text messages.
US telephone and cable television companies are rushing to build these high
 -speed data channels. In California, for example, Pacific Bell, a regional
telephone company, has announced plans to provide such a service to nearly
half of the residents of the state within the next decade and to all
Californian homes by 2015. Over the next 18 months, the company will begin
trials of services such as 'movies on demand', video games, home shopping
and tele-education.
The prospect of enhanced communications services has set off a race to
provide devices that will connect to these new networks. Intel, the leader
in microprocessor chips - the 'brains' inside a computer - is working with
Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, and General
Instruments, a supplier of cable television control boxes, to develop a
decoder device that will take the signals from the information superhighway
and display them on a television set.
General Magic, another Silicon Valley company which is developing software
for personal communicators, calls the approach 'whole person' computing.
Computers should be fun to use, not devices that try the patience and test
the technical acumen of users, the company maintains.
Not everyone will be excited at the prospect of having vast quantities of
information available at their fingertips whether it be the 500 TV channels
promised by cable companies or instant access to libraries full of
publications over the phone. People are already inundated with information
from newspapers, television, junk mail, facsimile and telephone messages.
But this is where the friendly computer 'agent' comes in. Your electronic
assistant will filter all your messages, throw away the 'junk' and sort the
rest according to your priorities.

FT  17 APR 93 / Bank at the heart of the new Europe: Ron Freeman, first vice
president of the EBRD, responds to criticism of the institution's
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RON FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in May
1990 by 39 member countries (this is now 54), including the UK, and two
international institutions, primarily to finance privatisation in eastern
and central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
To date the board has approved investment of more than Pounds 1.6bn (Ecu2bn)
of the EBRD's own funds and we have raised an additional Pounds 6.3bn from
third party lenders and investors for 88 projects. No other institution,
public or private, has mobilised anything like these sums for eastern
Europe. Headquartered in London, the bank also provides a unique opportunity
for British industry to obtain 'local' financing for British investments and
business development among the 300m consumers in the eastern European
markets.
Last month Prince Charles inaugurated our new headquarters in the Broadgate
development in the City of London. We were gratified to be able to become
the anchor tenant in this building at very attractive terms. Our presence in
the Broadgate complex reinforces the City's standing as the heart of the
European financial community.
An article in the FT on March 29 confirmed that we had been able to fit out
the interior of this building without detracting from the quality of the
Broadgate complex. The article concluded that: 'The bank is indeed welcome
in London as a crucial and inventive catalyst for the new Europe. If the
creative atmosphere of culture and commerce, which is so evident in the new
headquarters, is indicative of its approach to the rejuvenation of formerly
communist Europe then the future in the east will be bright.'
Therefore, it was with decidedly mixed emotions that we read in the FT on
April 13, rapidly followed by other national papers, that we spent too much
money on ourselves, not enough on central and eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union and were too slow in disbursing funds.
On the one hand, we recognise such press attacks as a feature of life today,
as the BBC, the Bank of England, the government, and even the Crown can
confirm. As such my immediate reaction was to view this assault as a wry
form of acknowledgement that the EBRD had joined the UK establishment.
However, as a public institution it is our responsibility to set the record
straight on a number of the criticisms we have had levelled at us over past
few days.
First, let me deal with the costs of establishing our headquarters at
Broadgate. Before we committed to Broadgate, our advisers conducted
athorough review of all accommodation options in London. Our intention
throughout was to secure best value for money. We achieved this at
Broadgate, agreeing terms for our building which were highly competitive.
The building was finished to a 'shell and core' basis and needed then to be
fitted out for occupation.
The overall fitting out cost was Pounds 55.5m which we financed through a
variety of sources: a contribution from the landlord of Pounds 9.5m; a
29-month rent-free period for the new headquarters granted by the landlord,
saving the Bank Pounds 38.4m; a Pounds 250,000 contribution from the City of
London and Pounds 7.95m which would have been spent on rent at our temporary
accommodation at Leadenhall Street had the new building not been completed
in record time. Tight cost and budgetary control was exercised throughout by
us and the teams acting for us. In the event, the building was finished well
ahead of time and to budget, at a cost per square foot which is fully
comparable with other headquarters buildings in the City and indeed with
other international institutions.
Inevitably, there will be comment about some features of the building and
whether some things could have been done differently or at lower cost. In
overall terms, however, the approach which we adopted and the result which
we achieved in establishing our new headquarters will stand up to objective
scrutiny. We have ended up with a good building which suits our particular
requirements as cost effectively as any other we have found in London.
The second criticism was the level of funds we had disbursed to the
countries of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Compared with commitments made, the disbursement figure of Pounds 144m may
seem rather limited.
The reality is that disbursement of funds lags behind board approval
deliberately and by our own bank rules. First, since the majority of our
financing is for the private sector, state owners of entities we finance
must be 'implementing' a programme of privatisation. For state sector
financing, we must normally obtain sovereign guarantees. Either of these
alternatives requires government action prior to our disbursement.
Second, we co-finance nearly all our operations. This is consistent with our
goal of multiplying the impact of our financing. As indicated above, our
multiplier ratio is currently four to one, as the Pounds 1.6bn of EBRD
project approvals is accompanied by Pounds 6.3bn of third party
co-financing. To ensure this multiplier, we normally require that our
co-financiers' money goes into the project before ours.
Third, we must comply with international tender procedures in all our
projects. And finally we only disburse our funds directly against invoices.
These factors are all evidence of our caution. We are dealing with
taxpayers' money. We carry out all our operations according to sound banking
principles.
As a result, disbursement takes time. I would rather be accused of caution
in our disbursement process than of taking unnecessary risks with taxpayers'
money. Notwithstanding, we have disbursed as fast as any other funds
provider.
Let us now look to the future. We have already committed substantial funds
to projects in eastern Europe which will be disbursed as soon as the process
allows. We have this week been asked by the G7 group of leading
industrialised countries to establish a Dollars 300m fund with the specific
aim of promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the Russian
Federation.
We are also charged by the G7 with implementing a Nuclear Safety Fund, with
a secretariat in the bank, which will allow the dangerous nuclear power
plants in eastern Europe to be overhauled. Finally, we have launched 260
technical assistance projects with a total value of Pounds 52.7m, much of
which is provided by British accounting, legal and consulting firms. Thus,
we have not been either slow to disburse or slow in any other respect as our
beneficiary countries have repeatedly confirmed. And, we are continually
looking at new proposals.
Next week, we hold our annual meeting in London. On this occasion we will
welcome more than 2,500 foreign guests out of 3,000 participants
representing both governments and business communities, to London. All will,
I am sure, share with us our pride in the fast start we have made in
carrying out our mission, the splendid staff we have assembled and the role
we assume as the sole international institution headquartered in the UK.
I anticipate that as a result of this meeting many new proposals will come
to the bank. The bank provides a forum where investors from both eastern and
western Europe can meet to finance investment opportunities in eastern
Europe.
I am confident that the UK business community will not be distracted by the
misdirected focus of current press coverage, but will instead participate
fully with us in the extraordinary opportunity presented by the greatest
event of our times; the opening of the European continent.

With reference to Dominic Lawson's article, 'What the President did not say'
(April 10/11), Mr Lawson is within the bounds of propriety in analysing
President Clinton's letter and even in attributing ulterior motives to him.
However, what I think is particularly distressing is the last paragraph of
his letter in which he suggests that President Clinton and others would be
'stinking hypocrites' if they do not in the future send messages of sympathy
on the occasion of the death of a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Given the fact that neither President Clinton nor most other politicians are
likely continually to send messages of condolence whenever an atrocity is
perpetrated, Mr Lawson would in effect have us conclude, in advance, that
President Clinton and other are 'stinking hypocrites'. Now really. . .]

FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: A surfeit of scorn, a tilt at British institutions -
and meanwhile the barbarians are at the gate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J G FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was sickened by Michael Thompson-Noel's two articles,
'Travel-Soothing luxury of the 'real' Bali', and 'Hawks &amp; Handsaws' (April
10/11). The first was an unoriginal piece of nastiness: the journalist from
his all-expenses-paid five star hotel pouring scorn on the local culture
which he has neither the wit nor the inclination to research.
But it was the second piece, about the Grand National, which really made me
see red. How dare he compare the voided race with the fall of Saigon? How
dare he label as unintelligent all those who enjoy or are involved in
National Hunt racing and the Grand National in particular - no football
hooligans these but the widest possible cross section of the British public?
Has he ever been to a race meeting?
Yes, the anachronistic starting system will be modified; but it worked well
enough in previous years. Significantly, it was delay and the resulting
over-anxiety at the start which exposed the flaws in the system. And what
caused the delay? An animal rights protest.
But Mr Thompson-Noel is not really interested in horses. He has just used
the event as an excuse to tilt at Britain's traditions and institutions
(including the poor old monarchy again) - his target being those special
attributes of English heritage which in the past have earned the respect and
admiration of the rest of the world.
And what shall we have left when these traditions and institutions have been
dismantled? A mediocre England in a mediocre Europe, governed by classless
politicians and media men, a country within which the pseudo-intelligentsia
like Mr Thompson-Noel can flourish.
The irony is that one of these respected institutions, the Financial Times,
can allow a member of its staff to publish such subversive propaganda.
And what will he achieve from this, the odious Mr Thompson-Noel, the middle
class revolutionary with the double-barrelled name? Well, probably another
freebie holiday in an even more exotic place than Bali, well beyond the
means of those who earn their living from a less distasteful profession.
I despair more and more for the future of this country. Truly, there are
barbarians at the gate.

FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: A model with something important to say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BRITTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to respond to Wynne Godley's letter about the use of
macroeconomic models in forecasting and policy design (April 14). A model is
not a 'monster', but a convenient way of setting out in formal mathematical
terms the lessons you think you have learnt from experience. One advantage
of doing this explicitly is that the basis on which you form your judgment
is there for the public to see and to criticise. It makes economic
forecasting less like soothsaying, and more like applied science.
After the devaluation of sterling last September, we decided at the
institute to back our model and to predict a significant economic recovery
beginning in the early part of this year. In doing this we were using the
relevant information about the way that the economy had responded to
exchange rates and interest rates in the past. But we were going against the
forecasting consensus and the gloomy mood of industry at the time. That mood
has changed now, and it begins to look as if the model had something rather
important to say.

FT  17 APR 93 / A squall over Street: A small town awaits the outcome of a
family row over the Clark shoe business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is amiss in the town of Street, Somerset. The Clark family is
falling out.
The Clark's shoe business - based in Street since it was founded 168 years
ago - has been built on market expertise and family harmony, in the Quaker
tradition. Now, the future of the UK's biggest shoemaker is obscured by an
emotionally charged dispute between family members. The town's inhabitants
are watching anxiously, concerned about employment and the local economy.
The arguments in the family have been prompted by the question of whether to
sell the business. They have been brought to a head by an approach from
Berisford International, the UK property and agribusiness group. A formal
offer for C&amp;J Clark is expected within the next few days. From then until
the company's extraordinary general meeting on May 7, when the shoemaker's
fate will be decided, board relations are likely to become increasingly
tense.
Disagreements are not new. Since the early 1980s, when the growth of cheap
imports from Asia started to affect profits and margins, shareholders have
been divided over the best way forward for the private company. The problems
in the market have been compounded by recession. Pre-tax profits have fallen
from Pounds 30m in 1990 to just Pounds 1.7m last year. Not surprisingly the
500 members of the Clark family which own about 80 per cent of the company
are worried. Most have all their personal wealth tied up in the shares,
which have fallen from almost Pounds 2 in 1990 to 90p.
But if all are agreed that the business faces problems, the Clarks differ
over the best solution. There are three basic factions: sellers, sellers at
a price, and non-sellers.
Many of the sellers are in need of money. Some shareholders have suffered
losses in the Lloyds insurance market, while others have found their incomes
sharply reduced by last year's cut in the company's dividend from 7.5p to
3.8p.
Those advocating a sale also include directors such as Daniel Clark,
great-great grandson of the founder and a former chairman, with a 7 per cent
stake. Daniel has stated publicly that only a sale could end years of
shareholder interference in the running of the business.
Daniel, one of two family members on the 11-member board who favours a
change of ownership, has personal reasons to complain. While chairman,
between 1967 and 1986, he and his team were strongly criticised by a
triumvirate of retired directors, including his own father and a
predecessor, Bancroft Clark. The three executives had ruled over Clark's in
the glory days of expansion after the second world war and controlled the
bulk of the family shareholding. They felt that Daniel was resisting their
advice, in particular their calls for increased overseas sourcing, and
forced him to make way for the company's first non-family chairman, Larry
Tindale.
Others, such as Anthony Clothier, the grandson of a Clark daughter, say they
have no alternative to a sale. With the shares traded only twice a year many
investors find it difficult to take advantage of their inherited wealth. A
previous attempt to float 25 per cent of the company in 1989 failed when
shareholder support fell just short of the required 75 per cent.
Mr Clothier, a former director who parted company with Clark's in 1986, also
contends that the difficulties of running a company with such a vociferous
family shareholding are too great at a time of deep recession. 'Things
cannot go on as they are,' he says. 'We need a proper board to get on with
the running of the business.'
Nevertheless, Mr Clothier is prepared to consider alternatives. These
include the creation of a voting trust to represent the family stake, thus
reducing the impact of board divisions. This would be followed by eventual
flotation. The problem is, he says, there are no concrete proposals on the
table. Thus, 'it would be stupid not to consider the Berisford bid.'
The second faction is prepared to sell, but not at the 205p a share which
Berisford is expected to offer. It includes non-family shareholders who,
having seen last week's balance sheet, believe the decision to sell has come
at the wrong time. In its annual statement, Clark's showed a net asset value
of 278p, against 282p last year.
Mr Henry Cook, who retired from Clark's retail division in 1987 after 39
years at the company, has changed his mind about the bid in recent days.
'Now I'm wondering whether we would not be giving the business away too
cheaply,' he says.
This last argument has been used by those resolutely opposed to a sale,
including four family board members. Mr Charles Robertson, a founder member
of the lobby group, Shareholders Opposed to an Enforced Sale (Shoes), is
adamant that to sell now, when Clark's has just finished a Pounds 12.5m
restructuring programme, would not be in anyone's interest. He believes that
many of the difficult tasks facing the company have been achieved, including
the closure of the original factory in Street last year and a sharp
reduction in the workforce.
The feelings of this last group run deep, rooted in 168 years of tradition
based in the town where Cyrus and James Clark set up their sheepskin slipper
factory in the farmyard of their elder brother Joseph.
The town of 11,000 has been largely built by the Clark family which, in the
Quaker tradition, promoted the welfare of its workers through the provision
of libraries, schools, swimming pools and social clubs. Many members of the
family still live there.
The original farmhouse where the first Clark set up house in 1720 still
stands. It is inhabited by Richard Clark, one of the rebel board directors
who jealously guards the family's position in the company. Richard, along
with many of the non-sellers, are determined to retain family control of
Clark's for a variety of reasons. The less sentimental argue that any
sensible investor, with their wealth tied up in one company, would want
control of that investment.
For this group, who claim it is not a family row, the troubles started when
outsiders began to wield influence. About 20 years ago, they say, the board
was made up mainly of family members. 'There were not meetings of the family
to alter anything, partly because there were a lot of family members in the
company's management,' says Robertson.
However, Shoes has accepted that the formula of 20 years ago may not apply
in the 1990s. Hugh Pym, a Clark and founding member of the lobby group, says
Shoes backs 'work already being done . . . to set up a board which is
realistic for the needs of the company'. This would include a shareholder
council to channel views to directors.
Opponents of a sale also believe that Clark's troubles of recent years are
almost over. 'The company is actually recovering and it will happen quite
quickly,' says Nathan Clark, the 76-year-old great grandson of the company's
founder and inventor of the desert boot. 'As soon as we are making better
profits again, people will not want to sell.'
In Street the locals watch the dispute with a degree of resignation. 'We
just wish they would knock their heads together so we can get back to work,'
says one local resident.

FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: British Rail - self-delusion in industrial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So Sir Bob Reid has his revenge. No more check-off ('Rail strike looms
as talks break up after eight minutes', April 15). The unions can collect
their own dues. We have come a long way from the pre-Second World War days
when it was the unions who organised the training for footplate men who
wanted promotion, when unions helped work out fair duty rosters and
promotion systems which accorded with workers' sense of fairness by taking
account of seniority - 'service' - as well as of merit. And when people
rather enjoyed travelling by rail.
There were two ways to go from there; the German/Japanese way of formalising
this kind of 'microcorporatist' union involvement, sometimes thereby
sacrificing potential short-term profits in the interests of (i) the
flexibility needed for long-term change, and (ii) the concern for quality
(eg, caring about service to the 'customers' and whether trains run on
time), which comes from high worker morale and a spirit of co-operation. The
alternative is the US way based on two principles: (i) efficiency is to be
defined in terms of the effect on profit and loss in the short term; (ii)
the only effective work incentives are short-term, in cash and based on
individual not group performance. Rigorous application of these requires
total managerial control; the only good union is a dead union.
British and American managers have seized on the transitional slow-down in
German and Japanese growth to proclaim the bankruptcy of those countries'
recipes. Self-delusion can always find evidence to sustain itself. Luckily,
some leading private sector companies - eg, ICI - are wiser. But BR is still
ours, subject to political decision. Parliament is about to intervene to
push it further down the US road. One-nation Tories, where are you?

FT  17 APR 93 / Revival reawakens old demons: Barry Riley examines the
extent to which the end of the UK recession may mark the beginning of higher
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in the annual headline inflation rate from 1.8 to 1.9 per cent last
month might not seem very significant, but it was enough to set off a minor
attack of the jitters in the financial markets yesterday.
The background is an apparent revival of the British economy. Once again the
forecasters appear to have got it wrong, this time by being too cautious,
and manufacturing output in February was 1.5 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Meanwhile a frisson of expectation spread through the housing
market over Easter, and the press positively glowed at the indications of a
recovery in house prices.
But will the downside to the economic recovery be a revival in inflation?
This week's wholesale price indices for March appeared to show that industry
is still absorbing much of the inflationary year-on-year 8.3 per cent rise
in input costs of materials and fuel which has resulted from last year's
devaluation. Output price inflation has remained stable at about 3.7 per
cent for several months.
But if demand picks up substantially industry could decide to take advantage
of the opportunity to rebuild its battered profit margins.
Mortgage interest rate cuts in the past few months have allowed the headline
rate of retail price inflation to fall below 2 per cent, the lowest level
for 26 years, but the underlying rate excluding mortgage interest has stayed
obstinately at around 3 1/2 per cent.
This is the version of the inflation rate that the government is targeting
within a 1 to 4 per cent range. Both the Treasury (which has forecast a 3
3/4 per cent rate for the final quarter of 1993) and the Bank of England
appear to believe it is touch-and-go whether the 4 per cent ceiling will be
exceeded later this year which may explain why the government has been so
pleased to see sterling strengthening in recent weeks.
Indeed the sterling index has bounced up by more than 5 per cent since its
February low point, and although exporters may not be pleased at losing
competitiveness, nevertheless there will be benefits for inflation, for
instance from this week's cuts in petrol prices.
But these are very short-term effects. Does anybody really believe that over
the longer run Britain's bad inflationary habits have been cured? Certainly
the long end of the government securities market weakened on this week's
evidence of economic recovery. Long gilt yields of about 8.3 per cent strike
an awkward compromise between the 4 and 6 per cent returns in Japan and
Germany, regarded as low inflation countries, and the double-figure yields
of, for example, Italy and Spain.
There are two schools of thought. One argues that almost regardless of what
the British government does the country has entered a period of strong
deflationary tendencies. It could be quite misleading, and indeed dangerous,
to look back to the 1970s and 1980s and follow over-restrictive policies.
But many other people are scarred by their inflationary experiences of the
past 25 years, during which average annual inflation has been 9 per cent.
Professional investors in the City of London are deeply cynical about the
ability and integrity of the government. They fear that the huge scale of
prospective public borrowing will eventually force the government down an
inflationary path.
To begin with, however, the optimists. The first point is that the decline
in inflation is common to most developed countries, even to those like Italy
which have the worst financial problems.
Average inflation in the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations has
dropped from 4.7 per cent in 1990 to maybe 2.5 per cent this year.
Besides the short-term cyclical effects from the current recession, there
has been a long-term downtrend in commodity prices. Moreover the emergence
of big new industrial powers, notably China, has depressed the price level
of traded goods, which in turn has caused industrial recession and a
shakeout in the labour markets, especially in Europe. Pay pressures have
collapsed: yesterday's UK rail strike was about job security rather than
incomes, while pay inflation is now below 5 per cent and hitting new lows.
Moreover many of the English-speaking countries (together with Scandinavia
and Japan) are in the grip of so-called debt deflation, as they seek to
throw off the after-effects of bank lending binges and property market
bubbles.
The UK is a prime member of this group. Through the 1980s the broad measure
of the money supply, M4, grew at an average annual rate of 16 per cent,
fuelling eventual inflation.
But now M4 growth has collapsed to little more than 3 per cent, which
according to monetarist economists makes a revival of inflation quite
impossible in the near future.
Finally, the social balance in Britain has changed substantially over the
past 25 inflationary years. The trade unions, primarily representing
aggressive younger workers, have dwindled in importance; pensioners and
other older age groups who fear inflation have grown in relative numbers.
The inflation of the 1970s, it can be argued, was triggered by a combination
of trade union power and commodity price shocks.
By the 1980s inflation had been brought right down (to 2.4 per cent in the
summer of 1986) but a new burst was set off by irresponsible financial
deregulation leading to excessive monetary growth.
Now, however, monetary growth is, if anything, too low. There is no need to
worry about inflation any more.
Investors, on this argument, may be making a dangerous mistake - the reverse
of the error made in the postwar period when fixed interest securities were
bought without proper regard to the danger of future inflation. This time
investors are staying in equities or in short-term deposits instead of
buying long-dated gilts on yields of 8 per cent-plus. When those yields
tumble to 5 or 6 per cent as fears of inflation dwindle, big profits will be
made. Investors clinging to the equity market or building society accounts
could be left more or less stranded.
But experienced British investors who have spent a lifetime combating the
menace of inflation cannot change their mind set quite so easily. Above all
they are concerned about the vagueness of government policy. If a fiercely
independent central bank like the Bundesbank were in charge it would be very
different. But the British government bungled its participation in the
European exchange rate mechanism and is now wallowing in apparent confusion.
For instance, until recently it was targeting the narrow version of the
money supply M0, which was supposed to rise no faster than 4 per cent
year-on-year. Recently, however, M0 growth has accelerated - to 4.9 per cent
for March. The government's response has been purest Sir Humphrey: it has
changed the target band to a 'monitoring range' which it says requires no
action.
Similarly, but in reverse, when M4 growth sank below the 4 per cent lower
limit of its previous monitoring range the Treasury simply widened the range
to 3 to 9 per cent. If the government's approach to monetary control is as
wishy-washy as this, how seriously can we take the target for underlying
inflation? This is for a range of 1 to 4 per cent in the near term, falling
to the bottom half of the range - that is, 1 to 2 1/2 per cent - by the time
of the next election in, say, 1996.
This kind of target in itself may be ill-advised. It has, for instance,
ruled out early rises in indirect taxes.
It also fails to differentiate between imported inflation, which may be a
good thing if it encourages a revival of production of traded goods in the
UK, and domestic inflation deriving from the public sector or the services
sector, which should unquestionably be avoided.
Inflation sceptics point to the desperate need of the government to get the
British economy moving ahead, which may cause it to bend its monetary
policies further. But the biggest problem arises from government borrowing,
forecast to reach Pounds 50bn in the current financial year, or 8 per cent
of gross domestic product, a level of excess spending not seen since the
inflationary 1970s. Borrowing on a similar scale could easily persist for
several years.
On March 31 the Bank of England auctioned Pounds 3bn of a 20-year gilt at a
yield of 8.53 per cent. Such issues are now coming monthly, and if inflation
is really to tumble to 2 per cent or so they will prove cripplingly
expensive for the taxpayer to service.
You can look at this problem two ways. On the one hand, faced with wary and
suspicious capital markets the government will find it difficult to pursue
inflationary policies, or interest rates will move up further. On the other
hand, the high interest rates will eventually make the debt burden
intolerable. At some point - which might be several years off - the
government would end its long-term funding programme and would resort to
financing itself through the banking system.
This would set off a new spiral of rapid inflation, and the holders of the
vast volumes of government debt now being issued would be the victims,
effectively, of progressive de facto default. So you can imagine two
profiles for the UK inflation rate. In one case there will be short-term
pressures as price rises suppressed during the ERM period emerge through the
pipeline, but deflationary forces will dominate as we move into the
mid-1990s.
On the alternative model, however, inflation will become re-established as
the economic recovery proceeds, and the difficulties of funding the public
sector deficit will become acute.
In practice, the key to the riddle may lie in how the government reacts to
economic shocks. But for the rosy scenario to unfold, surely at the very
least public borrowing must be reduced well below current medium-term
projections, and the authorities must develop a coherent and consistent
framework for monetary policy.
The government must resist delights such as a renewed house price boom, and
must initiate large-scale cuts in public spending. If you believe it will,
you may believe in its inflation targets.

FT  17 APR 93 / Leading Article: Clinton, Japan and Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER Mr Clinton will succeed in rejuvenating the US economy may be
doubted. What is noticeable, however, is how far he has changed the US
domestic debate. The same is true on the global economic stage. The week's
events in Tokyo - the Dollars 43bn package of assistance for Russia from the
group of seven industrial countries and the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn)
emergency spending programme announced by the Japanese government on Tuesday
 -bear witness to his impact.
It is not that either is an altogether new departure. Assistance for Russia
and stimulus packages in Japan were on last year's agenda as well. As often
happens, however, developments in policy preceded a change in
administration. Where the Bush administration was tentative, Mr Clinton's is
aggressive. At the top of its international agenda are the twin aims of
helping Russia and dealing with Japan. But its goals for the two countries
conflict. Mr Clinton wants to introduce market forces into Russia's
controlled economy and controls into Japan's market economy.
Naturally, that is not how he would put the point. The US view is that the
Japanese trade surplus is the result of obscure obstacles to the proper
working of the market. This week Japan announced an overall trade surplus
for fiscal 1992-93 of Dollars 111.34bn (Pounds 73bn), up 26 per cent on the
previous year. The bilateral surplus with the US was Dollars 46.1bn, up 20
per cent. Such figures reinforce US determination, as Mr Clinton must have
told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington
yesterday.
Pre-emptive
Japan's response was a shrewdly-timed pre-emptive fiscal strike. The
Japanese government produced its plump rabbit from the fiscal hat just as Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Warren Christopher, US
Secretary of State, arrived in Tokyo for the meeting of the group of seven
industrial countries on help to Russia and immediately before Mr Miyazawa
went to Washington. The Ministry of Finance even argued that the spending
and tax concessions would produce a 2.6 per cent increase in nominal gross
national product.
Governments would be sorely embarrassed if laws governing truth in
advertising applied to their pronouncements as well. As so often -
including, indeed, the Dollars 43bn supposedly on offer for Russia - the
rabbit was thinner than it looked. Many analysts believe the Japanese
package will generate at most half the growth envisaged by the government.
Unfortunately for Japanese international public relations, amongst the
doubters appears to be the redoubtable governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr
Yasushi Mieno.
Even the government claims that its measures would boost the country's
imports by only some Dollars 8bn, a mere dent in the surplus. Partly for
this reason, but still more because lobby-infested Washington views trade in
industry-specific terms, the Japanese package is unlikely to achieve its
chief strategic goal, which was to ward off US pressure for
'results-oriented' agreements on trade. Mr Christopher, for example, was not
so busy urging more support for Russia that he did not find time to persuade
Japan to solve individual trade issues.
Bottomless pit
Yet if the Japanese government is to secure target shares of particular
imports in the Japanese markets, it must first force its citizens to make
the necessary purchases. As foreign appetites grow upon what they feed, such
arrangements will spread, not just within Japan but to other successful
exporting countries. A market-oriented international trading system would
then be replaced by a sort of mini-Comecon.
Yet Mr Clinton's emissaries also put great pressure on Japan to assist Mr
Yeltsin in his attempts to rebuild the ruins left by the collapse of the
real Comecon. As usual, Tokyo did not dare to say 'no'. Japan did not raise
the vexed issue of Russian occupation of the Kurile islands. Instead, it
agreed to increase its planned bilateral assistance from Dollars 1.2bn to
Dollars 1.8bn. This it did despite its well known conviction that Russia is
the closest thing on earth to a bottomless pit.
If this perfectly plausible conviction is to be proved wrong, Russia must
have a coherent and effective government implementing a coherent and
effective reform strategy. At present doubters have good cause for their
doubts. Mr Yeltsin is going into a referendum on April 25 that poses great
risks for him. No likely result will give him the decisive victory he needs
if he is to rule where now he reigns.
It is only the extraordinary importance of the effort that justifies its
being made at all. But the same applies to Japan's wish to avoid
results-oriented trade. In Tokyo the Europeans - particularly the Germans -
insisted upon the importance of helping Mr Yeltsin, but stressed that they
themselves had done enough. Germany's position is certainly defensible. But
Europeans do have a fresh role to play in the US-Japan bilateral trade
conflicts. They should support Japan if it decides at last simply to say
'no'.

FT  17 APR 93 / Man In The News: A narrowing of horizons - Rocco Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rocco Forte is in Warsaw today where Lady Thatcher is due to reopen the
92-year old Bristol Hotel. The Bristol, a joint venture between Forte and
the Polish tourist agency, is a striking demonstration of the UK hotel and
restaurant group's drive to expand outside its home market.
Or so Mr Forte might have said a few months ago - expanding in continental
Europe has been Forte's priority for years. However, when this Thursday he
presented his first full-year results since taking over from his father as
chairman, the message was markedly different.
Forte is to sell Pounds 500m of assets over the next few years. It is
scaling back its US operation. The Continent will have to wait. Forte's
pre-tax profit of Pounds 72m before exceptional and property items was only
slightly up on last year's Pounds 70m, itself well down on the year before.
The value of the property portfolio has fallen by Pounds 344m. Gearing has
risen to 48 per cent. There are few signs of recovery. The dividend was cut
for the first time in 20 years.
These are burdens piled on top of the one Mr Forte has faced ever since, as
a 16-year old, he spent his holidays working in the cellars of the company's
Cafe Royal: that no-one is prepared to judge the son of Lord Forte,
Britain's greatest hotelier, in the way they would any other businessman.
'Poor old Rocco is trapped,' a City analyst once said. 'If things go well,
it's because of the company his father built up. If they go badly, it's
because Rocco cocked it up.' It is an observation with which Forte insiders
grimly concur.
Investors criticised the group's announcement last October that Mr Forte was
adding the title of chairman to the position of chief executive he had held
since 1983. Unease was heightened by the news that the 84-year old Lord
Forte was remaining on the board as president  - suggesting that little
would change.
The appointment of three new non-executive directors - Sir Anthony Tennant,
former chairman of Guinness, Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo, and Mr
Alan Wheatley, departing chairman of 3i - has only partly mollified critics.
The question of bringing in outside senior directors provokes an
uncharacteristically fiery response from the mild-mannered Mr Forte. He
says: 'There are a lot of people who would want to be on the Forte board.
But I went out and chose some high-powered and independent individuals.'
The critics accept that the three new non-executives are not pushovers. They
concede, too, that their appointment has changed the Forte board's balance
of power. 'These are Rocco's choices rather than his father's colleagues,'
says one. Several close observers note that Mr Forte seems more confident
since becoming chairman. Other board changes are likely to follow.
Mr Forte says that Sir Anthony, who is now Forte's deputy chairman, plays an
active role in the group. But when asked how often he sees Sir Anthony, it
turns out to be once a week at most.
City critics still want Forte to appoint a strong managing director. Mr
Forte says the group will appoint one eventually, but that it will not be a
complete outsider. He also makes it evident it will not be the sort of
person who might shrug him aside.
'It would have to be someone who has worked in the business for at least a
year,' he says. 'Someone from outside might have very different views. We
don't want to have rows. You've got to have harmony. The idea that you can
have two equally powerful men is complete nonsense. You either have a strong
chairman or a strong chief executive.'
The Forte group knows all about rows. The struggle between Lord Forte and
Lord Crowther, chairman of Trust Houses, rocked the City when the two groups
merged in the 1970s. The 1980s row was with the Savoy group. Mr Forte says
he does not intend to repeat that one either.
An acrimonious takeover battle left Forte with a majority of Savoy shares
but a minority of votes, after which the two sides declared a five-year
truce which ends in November next year. Mr Forte has not hidden his desire
to gain control of the Savoy, but he says he wants the two sides to reach a
civilised agreement when the five years are up. 'I think the way towards a
solution is on a discussed basis - not having a slanging match and punching
each other in public.'
Controlling the Savoy group would give Forte an internationally-renowned
name under which it could group its luxury hotels. Despite owning the Ritz
in Madrid, the Plaza Athenee in New York and the George V in Paris, Forte
has never entirely shaken its image as, in the sneering words of the then
embattled Savoy management, 'a vast combine which, among other things, runs
service stations on the main arterial roads.'
In the meantime, Mr Forte has enough to contend with. Last year, the group
bought the Relais motorway restaurant business in France and announced a
joint venture with Agip, the Italian state petrol company, to manage 18
hotels in Italy. It sold its Gardner Merchant catering company, but the
exceptional profit of Pounds 257m was outweighed by the collapse in property
values.
In the US, 15 Travelodge hotels are for sale. Mr Forte says the remaining US
motels are likely to be floated separately. He still wants to sell Forte's
in-flight catering business. Even the core hotels business might be reduced.
Mr Forte says 70 per cent of hotel profits comes from just 40
establishments.
The group this week offered shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend as an
alternative to the reduced cash payout. Mr Forte says the group will only
consider a rights issue if it has a large purchase in mind. With the City
still stunned by the financial crisis at the rival Queens Moat Houses, the
hotel sector is not currently an investors' favourite.
By the time the hotel business follows the rest of the UK economy into
recovery, memories of Queens Moat may have faded a little. If he can reduce
the group's debt, Mr Forte might then be able to fashion a new, more
internationally-based business. Until then, he will have to make the most of
what he has inherited.

FT  17 APR 93 / Rates on vacant premises at Pounds 574m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES IN England and Wales paid Pounds 574m in rates on empty property
last year, nearly 5 per cent of the total business rate bill, new statistics
show.
This is a sharp rise over previous years, in line with the large increase in
the number of vacant commercial properties. Most of the revenue came from
London, where the Pounds 353m of rates charged on unoccupied buildings was
nearly 9 per cent of the total London commercial rates bill.
The rising bill for rates on empty property, which is levied at half the
cost of occupied property, has become an increasingly heavy overhead for
landlords and those tenants that have been unable to find new occupiers for
unneeded premises.
Some landlords have escaped paying rates on empty buildings by stripping out
services to make their buildings uninhabitable. This option is not open to
tenants, many of whom are facing problems sub-letting unwanted space.
The statistics, which were not previously compiled, were put together by the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Institute of Revenues,
Rating and Valuation.
The body is lobbying the government to cut the empty-rates liability from 50
per cent of the normal levy to 25 per cent. It is also asking the government
to extend the grace period when occupiers are excused from paying rates from
three months to 12 months after they have moved out of their premises.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sharp rise in National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS con-tributed Pounds 4.36bn to government funding in the
1992-93 financial year, an increase of 39 per cent on the previous year.
The controversial fixed-rate First Option Bond, launched in July to increase
National Savings' intake, raised Pounds 880m in the year even though it was
on sale for only four months.
The best-selling National Savings category was fixed-interest certificates,
accounting for a net addition of Pounds 1.35bn. Index-linked savings
certificates were the next most popular category with a net addition of
Pounds 1.1bn.
Premium Bonds made a net contribution of Pounds 229m - more than double the
previous year's figure of Pounds 104m. Sales of Pounds 382m were the highest
for any financial year since they were launched. Capital Bonds made a net
contribution of Pounds 582m.
National Savings said the amount contributed to government funding for the
year was 'in line with expectations' against a background of 'falling
interest rates and strong competition'.
Net receipts for March amounted to only Pounds 87m. Total gross sales were
Pounds 627m but National Savings made repayments of Pounds 540m. The
contribution to government funding in March, including accrued interest, was
Pounds 198m, with fixed-interest savings certificates making the highest
contribution.
The total amount invested in National Savings at the end of March was Pounds
44.1bn.

FT  17 APR 93 / Building materials groups act on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME construction materials companies are managing to raise prices to
rebuild profit margins, but many are having difficulty making the increases
stick.
Customers of cement group Blue Circle have already received notification of
price rises of between 2 per cent and 3.5 per cent to take effect from June.
For the rise to stick, Blue Circle needs its big customers, such as RMC, to
pass on the increase through higher concrete prices. RMC has not officially
decided on such a move yet.
The pattern across the whole construction materials industry is similarly
patchy.
Redland tried to raise the price of concrete roofing tiles in January.
Yesterday, Mr Gerald Corbett, the company's financial director, admitted
that discounting was still going on, although volumes were up.
Brick prices, which have fallen by a third over the past two years, remain
depressed.
Mr Michael Rose, managing director of Butterly Bricks of Ripley, Derbyshire,
said: 'Stocks have peaked at record levels in the last few months.'
Timber importers have tried to raise prices, spurred by the fall in the
value of sterling as much as a desire to rebuild margins, but have so far
failed.
Mr Bruce Wright, finance director of London-based Meyer International, said:
'The sterling price of softwood is the same as it was 10 years ago.'
Plywood and chipboard have fared a little better, helped by Japanese demand.
Prices are 1 per cent to 2 per cent higher this year.
Mr David Taylor, building materials analyst at stockbroker UBS, said that
the PVC industry, which supplies piping and guttering, has also tried to
raise prices without success.
Plasterboard price rises in the first quarter had trouble in holding but
since the end of March the increases have become more widespread.
Knauf (UK), the Kent-based subsidiary of a German company increased prices
by about 10 per cent on March 29. Mr Tony Galloni, marketing manager, said:
'It is too early to tell whether the new prices are holding.'
Pilkington raised glass prices by 8 per cent in February and says the prices
have held. The company said: 'The glass merchants are keen to see prices
rises stick so they can raise their own margins.'
Pilkington is also raising the price of insulation materials by between 7.5
per cent and 10 per cent from April 26. But the company acknowledged it has
been 'very difficult to get these rises to stick in recent months'.

FT  17 APR 93 / Another Group 4 prisoner escapes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE WERE last night searching for another prisoner who escaped yesterday
from a court guarded by Group 4 Court Services, Britain's first private
prison-escort service.
The man fled from Sheffield magistrates' court shortly after being sentenced
to 14 days in prison. Group 4 said one of its custody officers suffered
facial injuries while trying to prevent the escape.
Yesterday's incident increased to five the number of escapes since Group 4
took over prisoner-escort services last week in the east Midlands, Yorkshire
and Humberside.
Another two prisoners have been wrongly released.
At a meeting with Group 4 on Thursday Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of
the Prison Service, held the company responsible for only one of the first
four lost prisoners. Further problems with the Group 4 contract since the
meeting will, however, add considerably to pressures on Mr Lewis and Home
Office ministers, who are facing opposition ridicule over the escapes.
The issue is certain to be raised by MPs when Mr Lewis and Mr Peter Lloyd,
the Home Office prisons minister, appear before the cross-party Commons home
affairs committee on Monday.

FT  17 APR 93 / Water purity boils down to a question of price: Next week
the results of surveys by water companies will start to emerge. They have
taken the unusual step of asking their customers how much they are prepared
to pay for purer water before they commit themselves to the huge investment
needed to bring English and Welsh water into line with EC standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, JIMMY BURNS and RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE water companies' customers are so concerned about rising bills that some
companies may ask industry regulators to allow them to delay expensive
modernisation.
That is one of the results to emerge from the first nationwide surveys of
water customers' attitudes, which water companies will start to publish next
week.
Water companies have found that where customers are offered a choice in
standards of service or water quality, they often prefer to have lower
bills, even if that means forgoing some improvements.
The exceptions are improving the taste of drinking water, the cleanliness of
beaches and replacing lead piping.
Customers' strong feelings about bills in many regions of England and Wales
are likely to play a part in government deliberations over whether to
privatise the Scottish water industry, already emerging as a political
battleground.
Most of the 33 companies in England and Wales will soon publish the
conclusions from months of interviewing customers, domestic and commercial,
in the biggest exercise of its kind in the industry.
The consultations were ordered last summer by Ofwat, the industry regulator,
at the same time as it published its controversial report, The Cost of
Quality, which warned that ambitious environmental regulation would continue
to push up bills above the rate of inflation for many years. Ofwat told
companies that they had to gauge customers' reactions before committing
themselves to further investment between 1992 and 2005.
In the past month Ofwat has clashed with the National Rivers Authority, the
water quality watchdog, over whether all these improvements - which could
cost about Pounds 45bn in the 1990s - are necessary. Friction has arisen
because Ofwat, which fixes price rises, does not control the environmental
regulations, which are set by the European Commission, the UK government and
the NRA.
The survey methods chosen by the 10 large companies to get round this
problem ranged from Welsh Water's questionnaire posted to all customers, to
Thames Water's 'quality circles' with hand-picked panels, and long
face-to-face interviews by many of the others.
Customers were keen to have their say. Welsh Water said: 'We have been
overwhelmed by the speed and volume of the response. Within five days of the
first questionnaires going out, 67,000 of our 1.2m customers had replied.'
North West Water, which conducted hour-long interviews with its chosen
sample, said that more than half did not realise that the company managed
sewage as well as water, and so were unaware of the link between their bills
and the company's spending programme of more than Pounds 5bn this decade.
Preliminary analysis suggests that the surveys will strengthen Ofwat's
argument that the pursuit of perfection in water standards, beyond levels
necessary for health, is resented by many cus-Tomers.
Companies have found that:
Much customer concern focuses on the spending needed to meet the EC urban
waste water directive, one of the most expensive of all the new rules, which
covers treatment of sewage and its discharge to estuaries and coasts.
Water companies have estimated that this directive alone could cost Pounds
8bn. Many customers would like to see the most ambitious improvements - such
as waste water treatment - stretched out over a longer period to slow the
rise in bills.
Customers are prepared to pay more for some 'aesthetic' improvements such as
avoiding discoloured water in the Northumbrian region and, in Wessex,
better-tasting water and a solution to the problem of rivers running low.
While customers are wary of future price rises, they are generally
appreciative of the investment that has already been made. They tend to
accept the principle that much of the cost of improvements is passed on to
them - Anglian Water reports that more than three quarters of its customers
are willing to pay more for higher standards.
The companies will publish these responses and their spending plans in
'market plans' which Ofwat says must be made available to customers in a
'short, illustrated document in non-technical language'.
The market plan will be a main part of the business projections which the
companies must submit to Ofwat next spring, as a basis for Ofwat's periodic
review.
The review will be the first wide-ranging assessment of pricing formulae
since the 1989 water privatisation and will set price rises until 2005.
Ofwat said last week 'customers were not involved in setting price rises at
privatisation and this time Mr Ian Byatt (Ofwat's director-general) wants
them to play a part'.

FT  17 APR 93 / Developers are urged to take up public cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY COMPANIES are failing to take advantage of billions of pounds worth
of public-sector funding, a local-government minister said yesterday. Mr
John Redwood appealed for action from commercial developers to spark the
market into life.
He warned property specialists that they risked missing the bottom of the
market if they did not act now. He said nearly Pounds 3bn of government
money was available over five years for those working in tandem with public
bodies under schemes such as City Challenge partnerships and urban
development corporations.
Mr Redwood said in a Commons debate on local-government services that the
present state of the property market presented 'enormous opportunities'.
There had rarely been a better conjunction of rental yields and borrowing
costs.
'When do the property specialists think they will next be able to buy
properties and undertake developments at current high yield levels and
current low interest rates?' Mr Redwood asked. 'Why did so many clamour to
buy land at Pounds 1m or more an acre in 1988, which they would now turn
down at Pounds  1/4 m an acre?'
The government would benefit from a revival in the property market because
it wants the private sector to play a leading role in reviving urban areas.
It is also seeking to dispose of large tracts of land and property through
organisations including the Commission for New Towns, which has about Pounds
2bn of property to sell; English Estates, the government's property
development arm; and public-sector bodies such as British Rail.
The property industry is reluctant to increase investment as it is hamstrung
by the oversupply of buildings - particularly offices in the south - its own
weak finances and the reluctance of banks to make further loans to property.
Property companies are especially reluctant to invest in the inner-city
areas favoured by the government.
The few developers which are still active in inner cities say that an
increasingly high proportion of public money is needed if schemes are to be
viable.
Turning to local government, Mr Redwood made clear that the government had
no philosophical objection to councils contracting private companies to
provide any service for which they were responsible. Under the government's
concept of the 'enabling' council, authorities decided 'how much service the
community requires but does not necessarily employ the people providing it'.
Councils should move to 'make the best use' of what the marketplace had to
offer. Market testing was not just a way of cutting costs but could also
improve service quality.
Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local-government minister, said the government's
'real' policy over 14 years had been to dismantle local democracy in order
to centralise power in Whitehall.
He accused the government of contributing to the 'failure' of the Canary
Wharf development by ignoring the advice of the local community.

FT  17 APR 93 / Boost to food costs pushes up inflation: Prices are up 1.9%
but construction suppliers say it is difficult to make rises stick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPER PRICE increases for food were the main influence behind the rise in
inflation last month, official figures showed yesterday.
The retail prices index rose by 0.4 per cent in March from 138.8 in February
to 139.3. Compared with a year ago, prices were up by 1.9 per cent,
marginally higher than in February, when the annual rate was 1.8 per cent.
Although mortgage interest rates fell more steeply last month than at the
same time last year, increases in food prices were sharper than a year ago.
This, with price rises for motoring, clothing and household goods, nudged
the all-items index upwards.
The Central Statistical Office reported that excluding mortgage interest
payments - an underlying measure favoured by the Treasury - the annual rate
rose to 3.5 per cent in March from 3.4 per cent. The month-on-month rise in
this index was 0.7 per cent.
The sharpest price increases were for seasonal food, in particular fresh
vegetables and home-killed lamb. The CSO said price increases for
non-seasonal foods such as beef, dairy products, sugar and soft drinks
reflected the recent devaluation of the 'green pound' in which agricultural
products are priced.
Overall food prices rose 0.8 per cent on the previous month and 1.5 per cent
in the year to March, the largest March rise since 1986.
There were also big price increases for clothing and footwear. On the month,
prices rose 1.9 per cent, reflecting recoveries from the sharp reductions in
the winter sales and increases for the new seasons' fashions in the shops.
A 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise in fuel and light prices reflected
increases of domestic heating oil prices. The final phase of the recent
increase in telephone charges was behind a 0.5 per cent rise in household
services prices compared with February.
Motoring expenditure prices rose by 1 per cent on the month, mainly as a
result of increases in petrol and second-hand car prices.
City economists had been expecting an unchanged inflation rate in March,
although the modest increase is unlikely to generate new concerns about
growing pressure on price increases.
Increases in excise duties announced in the Budget will start to affect the
retail prices index this month. Statisticians said the effect on the annual
rate would be fairly neutral, however, because of similar rises a year ago.

FT  17 APR 93 / Tax adviser in court over deception totalling Pounds 330,896
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER owner of an accountancy firm and former chairman of Nottingham
Forest Football Club yesterday admitted obtaining a total of Pounds 330,896
by deception.
Mr Julian Baughan QC, prosecuting, said Mr Maurice Roworth, 63, from
Lowdham, Nottingham, had posed as a taxation expert and offered to invest
clients' money although he had no qualifications and was not registered to
carry out any kind of investment business.
He had started work at the Nottingham accountancy firm of White and Co as a
clerk in 1949 and worked his way up to managing director, eventually owning
the firm outright and conducting a tax-advice business.
Birmingham Crown Court heard that through the firm he took up to Pounds
750,000 from friends and business associates, telling them he was investing
their money in the Isle of Man.
He used the cash to pay off personal bank overdrafts while assuring friends
their money was safe.
It was alleged that the deception was carried out between 1982 and 1991. He
was arrested in March last year.
Mr Baughan said: 'Over a nine-year period he received a total of 34 payments
from clients, but none were invested in the Isle of Man or anywhere else.
They all went to credit his two NatWest bank accounts and had the effect of
reducing his overdrafts.
'Despite substantial payments into his bank he was still overdrawn by Pounds
450,000 at the time of his arrest and has since been declared bankrupt.
There are no funds available to compensate the losers.'
Mr Roworth pleaded guilty to eight specimen charges of obtaining money by
deception. Flanked by two prison officers, he sat perfectly still as the
prosecution outlined the case against him. He was remanded in custody to
await sentence in four to six weeks, when mitigation arguments will also be
heard.

FT  17 APR 93 / Sharp rise in National Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS con-tributed Pounds 4.36bn to government funding in the
1992-93 financial year, an increase of 39 per cent on the previous year.
The controversial fixed-rate First Option Bond, launched last July to
increase National Savings' intake, raised Pounds 880m in the year even
though it was only on sale for four months.
The launch of the bond provoked charges of unfair competition from building
societies, which blamed the government for their own shortfall in funds last
year.
But the shortfall far exceeded the amount taken by the First Option Bond.
Building society net receipts were Pounds 295m in 1992, down from Pounds
5.8bn in 1991. There was a net outflow of Pounds 262m in the third quarter
last year, when the bond was launched.
The best-selling National Savings category was fixed-interest certificates,
accounting for a net addition of Pounds 1.35bn. Index-linked savings
certificates were the next most popular category with a net addition of
Pounds 1.1bn.
Premium Bonds made a net contribution of Pounds 229m - more than double the
previous year's figure of Pounds 104m. Sales of Pounds 382m were the highest
for any financial year since they were launched. Capital Bonds made a net
contribution of Pounds 582m.
National Savings said the amount contributed to government funding for the
year was 'in line with expectations' against a background of 'falling
interest rates and strong competition'.
Net receipts for March amounted to only Pounds 87m. Total gross sales were
Pounds 627m but National Savings made repayments of Pounds 540m. The
contribution to government funding in March, including accrued interest, was
Pounds 198m, with fixed-interest savings certificates making the highest
contribution.
The total amount invested in National Savings at the end of March was Pounds
44.1bn.

THE Bank of England said yesterday it will hold its next auction of gilts on
April 28, when the stock on offer will have a maturity between 1996 and
1999, Peter Marsh writes.
The Bank will announce further details on April 20. It is thought the Bank
will seek to auction Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn worth of bonds as part of the
effort of funding this financial year's government deficit which is expected
to be about Pounds 50bn.

FT  17 APR 93 / Skills fear over Tecs' policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONWIDE supply of skilled electricians is being jeopardised by the
local emphasis of Training and Enterprise Councils, according to the
Electrical Contractors' Association, the main supplier of trained
electricians.
The association provides a broad-based national training programme through a
joint training organisation with the unions.
However, the 82 Tecs in England and Wales have different priorities for what
they perceive as local skills needs and this is reflected in the amounts
they offer to employers to take on young people under the Youth Training
programme.
The association said that the amount offered to employers by Tecs varied
from Pounds 15 to Pounds 40 a week, making it much less attractive in some
areas for employers to recruit young people. This development, combined with
the recession, had resulted in the intake for electrical installation
apprentices halving from 4,607 in 1990-91 to 1,770 in 1992-93.
There was no organisation, either of Tecs or at government level that was
looking at what the UK as a whole needed. Mr Harry Simpson, the
association's director, said: 'A consistent, uniform provision of training
funding and qualifying procedure on a national basis is essential if this
national training initiative and requirement is to be fostered and
fulfilled.'
The complaint is a common one among trade associations, which have a
national perspective of skills needs. Attempts by the associations and
industry training organisations to feed their requirements into Tecs'
planning procedures have not proved successful.
The government has sought to address some other concerns of national
training providers which have complained of the bureaucracy of negotiating
with up to 82 Tecs. The National Training Partnership is being set up to
negotiate funding with Tecs on behalf of the big national providers.
Amounts will still vary for the same training, however, and training
organisations will still be responsible for providing separate attendance
records and other details of each trainee's activities to individual Tecs.
Mr Simpson said these procedures absorbed much of the efforts of trainers.
Devonport Management, which runs the Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth, will not
take on any apprentices this year. Mr Ian Williams, for the company, said
this was because of job reductions and a much younger profile of the
workforce.
The dockyard has taken on up to 50 recruits a year in the past and
traditionally has been an important provider of craft and technology
training for the region.

FT  17 APR 93 / Smith seeks air strikes on Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, last night responded to growing public
alarm over Bosnia by backing for the first time 'punitive' United Nations
air strikes against Serb supply and communication lines, Ralph Atkins
writes.
He said an ultimatum should be issued to Serb forces in Bosnia threatening
that unless they agree to an immediate ceasefire 'the UN will begin air
strikes. . . consistent with the proposals being made by Lord Owen, the EC
peace envoy'.
His remarks broke the near-consensus between the Labour and Conservative
front benches that has prevailed so far. Mr Smith also called for an
immediate UN Security Council meeting to intensify economic and military
sanctions.
His decision to step up Labour's demands reflects pressure within the party
for a more aggressive stance.
Two frontbench spokesmen yesterday urged sending ground troops to Bosnia -
an escalation of UN involvement greater than Mr Smith has envisaged. Mr
Keith Vaz, local government spokesman, and Mr Tony Banks, spokesman on
London, said troops should be sent to enforce peace.
Separately 17 Labour MPs issued a letter calling for 'the active engagement
of troops on the ground' if required.

FT  17 APR 93 / Blizzard of publicity for Mars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GOOD old Brits came through with a Mars bar,' said the front-page headline.
Now Mars, the confectionery company, has launched an advertising campaign to
capitalise on the tale of the four British climbers who were rescued on
Thursday after spending six days stranded in the Russian Caucasus mountains
with their local guide.
Since the first Mars bar emerged from the original factory at Slough,
Berkshire, in 1932, Mars has probably spent more on advertising than the
annual gross domestic products of some countries.
In the UK alone last year the confectionery company spent Pounds 5.6m on
advertising the Mars bar.
For Mars the story of the climbers has been a case of some of the best
publicity coming free. One public-relations executive said: 'You can't even
buy (advertising space) on the front pages of the tabloids. The first page
you can buy in the Daily Star is page 11, and that will cost you thousands.'
The confectionery company is backing up the welcome free publicity with its
own advertising campaign. Today the British press is saturated with large
advertisements from Mars, featuring the part the chocolate bar played in the
survival of the lost climbers.
They are said to have endured the ordeal sustained only by snow and three
Mars bars.
Mars said yesterday: 'We're obviously absolutely delighted for the chaps
themselves. The fact they had the presence of mind to take Mars bars with
them is a terrific bonus.'
Out of near-tragedy, Mars has gained an almost priceless marketing benefit -
not just masses of free publicity, as the tabloids latched onto the story,
but an endorsement for its most famous product splashed across front pages
of national newspapers.
Mars did admit, however, to being a little puzzled. 'It's bizarre . . .
clearly there is not sufficient nutrition in a Mars bar to keep one person
going for a whole day, let alone five of them for more than one day,' the
company said.
So today's campaign does its best to reinforce the company's advertising
slogan: - 'A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play'.
Today's hurriedly created advertisements welcome back the four British
climbers, adding: 'Thank goodness they took their Mars bars with them.'
But for Mars, the most important message to get across is the punchline:
'There really is life on Mars.'

FT  17 APR 93 / Strike 'fails to halt many pits'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL said that half its 40 operational pits were producing coal
yesterday in spite of a 24-hour strike called by the National Union of
Mineworkers in protest at pit closures.
British Coal said this was twice the number of collieries that produced coal
on the first one-day stoppage on April 2. But it would not specify how many
miners reported for work.
The corporation suggested that pits were operating far beyond the moderate
Nottinghamshire coalfield, which as a stronghold of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers did not strike. But it would not specify which areas these were.
It added that many miners were also reporting for work at other collieries
where they were carrying out installation and salvaging work.
Mr Kevan Hunt, employee relations director, said: 'An increasing number of
NUM members have recognised the futility of staying away from work in a
protest to save their jobs.
'Mineworkers at pits producing today are giving a clear message that
industrial action is not the answer to the changes facing the coal industry
at this time,' he added.
Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire area of the NUM, accused the
corporation of 'propaganda'. He said the only jobs being undertaken were
concerned with safety and maintenance.
Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM president, said that all the collieries were
shut down by the strike.
Yesterday British Coal announced the end of production at two more mines,
Clipstone and Bevercote on the Nottinghamshire coalfield. From this weekend
all development work will end and production will cease on April 30. For the
time being the two pits will be placed on a care and maintenance basis. It
added there would be no compulsory redundancies with redeployment of men to
other pits.

FT  17 APR 93 / Asian bank considers acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEGHRAJ BANK, the private banking arm of Meghraj group, is exploring the
possibility of acquiring Equatorial Bank, which served about 3,000 Asian
small-business customers in the UK before it went into administration last
month.
The Asian community has been affected by the closure of four banks in the
past year, following the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International in 1991.
Roxburghe Bank went into administration earlier this month. Mount Banking
was wound up last October while Albaraka International Bank's deposit-taking
activities have been suspended.
Mr Anant Shah, chairman of Meghraj Bank said: 'With liquidity at around 60
per cent and with assets of over Pounds 225m, we are in a strong financial
condition. This gives us the ability to consider acquisitions and affords
Meghraj Bank a unique opportunity to strengthen its presence in the Asian
community in the UK.'
The bank has offices in the Isle of Man, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein and an
associate company in Jersey. Meghraj said it had instructed Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the accountants, to investigate the possible acquisition.

MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday attacked Baroness Thatcher's
claim that there was 'no such thing as society'. It marked a further
distancing of the government from the former prime minister's political
legacy.
After a week in which Lady Thatcher has embarrassed the government over its
Bosnia policy, Mr Lang said: 'Whoever said there is no such thing as society
was talking nonsense.'
At a meeting of the Scottish Tory Reform Group in Glasgow, Mr Lang urged the
Conservative party to 're-establish its ground'.
Lady Thatcher 'had a task to do: to destroy socialism and all its works. She
largely succeeded and that destruction is apparent not just in Britain but
around the world.'
Mr Lang argued it was 'self-evident' that society existed 'in every nation
or people that has found pluralistic form, whether tribal or clannish,
communal or colonial, national or imperial'.
He adopted a tone similar to calls by some senior Labour figures for a
government that addresses the aspirations of individuals.
Mr Lang urged Conservatives to seek 'the fulfilled society' in which
'talents are developed, where each has the chance to find a measure of
contentment in passing through life'.

FT  17 APR 93 / AT&amp;T 'ready to dig up Britain's streets'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US telephone company, is ready
to dig up Britain's streets to build its own telephone network if its
application for a UK telecommunications operator's licence is granted.
It said yesterday that it was prepared to spend millions of dollars on the
infrastructure necessary to reach private and business customers and that no
option was being ruled out.
The possibilities include buying lines from BT and Mercury, strategic
alliances with cable television operators with licences to offer
telecommunications services, radio links to homes and business premises and
laying underground cable.
AT&amp;T applied on Thursday for a licence to provide communications services in
the UK and between the UK and the US. Its application is direct retaliation
for BT's equivalent approach to the US Federal Communications Commission
last month.
Sources close to both companies said yesterday reciprocal licences were
likely to be granted within a year. Both the government and BT have welcomed
the AT&amp;T move. The government is keen to open the UK market to competition,
while BT sees it as a lever in its efforts to enter the US market.
AT&amp;T plans to move into the UK market in three phases if it wins its
licence. In the first it would offer international business customers the
same voice and data transmission services it offers in the US. A company
based in the US would be linked with UK subsidiaries by a single network.
Network management and billing would be handled comprehensively by AT&amp;T.
In the second phase it would add advanced services that are not marketed
extensively in the UK. In the US, for example, AT&amp;T handles 135m calls a day
 -40 per cent of which are generated by its 'free phone' service. Businesses
pay for their customers to make toll-free calls to them, generating business
worth Dollars 6bn a year to AT&amp;T.
The third phase would involve extending the service to domestic customers.
In the US customers pay Dollars 6 for their own free phone number on which,
for example, their children can call home without charge.
Mr David Haddington, director-general of the UK Telecommunications Managers
Association, welcomed the prospect of a new competitor in the UK market
prepared to invest heavily in the telecommunications infrastructure. Both
quality of service and prices would benefit.
He was concerned, however, that to boost cash flow AT&amp;T would concentrate in
the first instance on 'cherry picking' the more lucrative business services,
upsetting the delicate balance between BT and its smaller rival Mercury.
He said the emergence of global superplayers such as AT&amp;T and BT would
benefit business, leading to:
Harmonised global numbering schemes, where customers would 'own' their
telephone numbers and so be free of interference and manipulation by the
telephone operators.
Harmonised tariff structures. Mr Haddington said he did not expect uniform
pricing, but he did believe telephone calls between subscribers should cost
the same regardless of which of them initiated the call.
Harmonised standards for inteconnection between different telecommunications
systems to create a seamless global network.
BT plans to offer similar services in the US if granted a licence, through
its 'international virtual network' service - codenamed Cyclone - expected
to start this autumn with switching in London, New York, Sydney and
Frankfurt.
The key issue remains terms on which reciprocal licences will be granted.
AT&amp;T is determined that it should not have to negotiate with BT over access
to the UK company's network. In the US terms for access are published and
standard.
There are signs that BT finds the prospect of competing in the US market
sufficiently enticing to soften its stance on the price of access to its
network. About 40 per cent of the world's multinational companies have their
headquarters in the US and would be potential customers for Cyclone.

FT  17 APR 93 / Tougher rules for insurance brokers urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSUMERS' Asso-ciation yesterday called for tougher rules for insurance
brokers. It said advice offered to people buying policies was of poor
quality and sometimes 'abysmal'.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the association, described the
incompetence of some brokers and agents as 'truly alarming'.
The criticism follows a Consumers' Association survey published today which
revealed flagrant breaches of industry codes of practice governing the
activities of brokers and agents.
Anonymous researchers visited a random selection of 82 intermediaries in six
towns and cities. They found that intermediaries frequently failed to
disclose the amount of commission payments or to provide customers with
copies of insurance policies.
Many intermediaries also failed to give details of their status when
requested. More than half the intermediaries recommended 'clearly
inappropriate policies'.
Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the Association of British Insurers, said
he believed the survey overstated the problem. 'I don't think it's as bad as
that. Most people have perfectly satisfactory policies. It's always possible
to pick holes in a system.'
Ms Ruth Rooley, director-general of the British Insurance and Investment
Brokers Association, which represents 3,000 brokers, said the conclusions
underlined the need for greater investment in training and acknowledged the
need for regulatory reform.
She said the association's inability to enforce its code of practice was a
weakness in the system.
The Consumers' Association is recommending that the insurance brokers'
registration council or a new independent body should enforce regulations
more actively. It says the association 'has no effective sanctions' and 'has
neither the will nor the motivation' to fill the dual role of trade
association and regulator.
It is also recommending the introduction of minimum standards of
professional competence and better training.

GENERAL MOTORS is to supply Toyota of Japan with right-hand drive cars for
the Japanese market, the US motor group said yesterday.
The two companies agreed that GM would manufacture right-hand drive cars
with the Toyota badge in the US which would be marketed in Japan through the
Toyota dealer network, GM Japan said.
The agreement was reached between Mr John Smith, GM president and Mr Tatsuo
Toyoda, president of Toyota, in the US on April 5, GM said.
Toyota would neither confirm nor deny the deal, which was revealed by GM as
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, visits Washington for his first
meeting with President Bill Clinton.
Car and car parts exports to Japan have become an increasingly important
issue for the US. When former President George Bush visited Japan last year
Japanese motor manufacturers agreed to make efforts to import and locally
procure more US cars and car parts.
However, there has been increasing criticism in the US of what is seen to be
a lack of progress by the Japanese companies in carrying out their proposed
procurement plans.
Toyota, at the time, indicated it would make efforts to purchase Dollars
9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) worth of car parts worldwide by 1994. Of this, Dollars
5.28bn was expected to be purchased from the US, including local procurement
by Toyota's US manufacturing facilities.

THE SLUMP in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll on
companies, with a sharp rise in corporate bankruptcies last month and a
further fall in confidence among small businesses.
There were 14,441 corporate failures in the year to the end of last month,
up 22.7 per cent from the year before, according to a report by the Teikoku
Databank, the private research company. The rise in bankruptcies is
increasingly concentrated among smaller companies.
The rise was mainly accounted for by a 42.7 per cent increase in
manufacturing failures, a 29 per cent increase in failures in the service
sector and a 22 per cent rise among construction companies.
The severity of the slump among smaller companies was reflected in figures
published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which show
small business confidence declined sharply in the first three months of the
year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday announced that a protest
campaign calling for early all-race elections would continue to the end of
May.
The move came as South Africa braced itself for a weekend of potential
violence, with mass protests planned to mark the funeral of slain Communist
party leader Chris Hani. Mr Hani's body will lie in state from tomorrow and
he will be buried on Monday.
Business leaders and the ruling National party immediately condemned the ANC
announcement that mass action, which might include strikes, would not end
after the funeral as planned. ANC leaders were seen as struggling to placate
radical ANC youth, who regarded Mr Hani as a hero. A similar campaign last
May led to scores of deaths in clashes with police, and between rival black
groups.
ANC officials said they were concerned that negotiations had so far yielded
nothing concrete for their supporters. 'So far, all the negotiations have
accomplished is to get Chris Hani killed,' said one ANC official, quoting a
common view among angry young supporters.
Meanwhile, gunmen shot and wounded a white businessmen in the Transkei black
homeland, the fourth such attack in recent days. In South Africa itself, the
government declared emergency measures in 19 districts including
Johannesburg and drafted in police reinforcements. In these areas, police
may arrest without warrant, detain without trial and impose curfews.

FT  17 APR 93 / Spring rite keeps Swiss woman in her place at home / A look
at obstacles to women having a role in national life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY afternoon, a strange annual spring tribal rite will be played out
on the streets of Zurich.
According to a 650-year-old tradition, the (male) pillars of the city's
business establishment will dress up in medieval garb and, having had slap
up lunches in the halls of their various guilds (zunfts), will parade down
the streets of the old city on foot or on horseback. The procession ends in
a city park where a symbolic figure of winter, known as Boogg and capable of
being pronounced only by Swiss, is put to the torch.
The strangest part of this ritual is the audience. Lining the streets will
be mainly the men's wives, mistresses, secretaries and other female friends
and acquaintances, many of whom will have been dragooned into being there.
Their role is to throw flowers at their preening menfolk. The man who
accumulates the most flowers by the end of the parade acquires new prestige.
He is easily identifiable because he will have acquired a woman assistant
along the way to help carry his load of flowers.
Whatever else may be said about this festival, called Sechselauten, it is an
example of male domination in Swiss society. This is the country, after all,
where women have had the right to vote only since 1971, and that only at the
federal level. The tiny half canton of Appenzell Inner Rhodes (population
13,600) was finally forced by a federal court just three years ago to give
their women the vote in local matters.
Swiss women are still not permitted to work night shifts in factories and
they have so far made little headway in senior business circles. Moreover,
strong social and logistical pressures force them to stay home and look
after their children.
Primary school schedules, for example, are perversely arbitrary. A mother of
two may find that one child must attend school for two hours early in the
morning and two hours late in the afternoon, while the other has different
hours. She is thus in effect prevented from taking a regular job.
Swiss women soldiers have only been allowed to carry firearms since 1991 -
just pistols for self protection.
The army is undoubtedly one of the main clues to the strong strain of
misogyny in Switzerland. The Swiss army is a militia force in which every
able-bodied male must serve for an average of three weeks every two years
until he is 50.
While on army service, men from Switzerland's many different social and
cultural backgrounds rub shoulders and assess each other thoroughly in
trying circumstances. They then take the contacts and assessments back and
apply them in their civilian lives with a confidence that they could never
extend to women.
Meanwhile, women's main role in the country's defence is to stay home, look
after the children and do their menfolk's laundry which is sent back
regularly from the front by special free post.
There are signs Swiss leaders have finally recognised that they must change
their ways. A few leading companies have appointed a token woman to their
board. The army held its first mixed 17-week training course for recruits in
March. The air force will begin training its first women pilots in May.
But Swiss women are also growing more impatient, as was demonstrated three
months ago when a woman, Ms Christiane Brunner, was put up for election to
the federal cabinet. The overwhelmingly male parliament, which had only once
before agreed to put a woman in the country's supreme governing council,
bristled.
Ms Brunner was attacked for her militant feminism, her casual dress habits
and her past - she has had three husbands. To the surprise of the
parliamentarians, women throughout the country stood up and protested
against this muck-raking.
In the end Ms Brunner was not elected, but the parliamentarians felt obliged
to vote in another woman, Ms Ruth Dreyfuss. Ms Dreyfuss made clear that her
views were identical to those of Ms Brunner, notably on the idea that some
day women should be in the majority in the cabinet.
If that ever happened, their first move might be to outlaw Sechselauten.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC and US negotiators have apparently failed to make a breakthrough in two
rounds of talks this week in Brussels aimed at resolving the trans-atlantic
dispute over government buying rules.
The impasse raises the stakes ahead of next week's talks in Washington
between Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations,
and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'Everything depends on the
Brittan-Kantor talks,' the Commission said yesterday.
The US has threatened to impose sanctions against the EC unless the
Community agrees to suspend Article 29 of its utility directive which gives
a 3 per cent price preference for EC businesses bidding for contracts in the
gas, water, transport and telecommunications sectors.
The EC is prepared to waive the article, but only in return for reciprocal
concessions in the US market.
The sanctions would amount to just Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) on existing EC
contracts in the US, but the political fall-out would be much greater. EC-US
relations have soured over disagreements on steel subsidies and the stalled
Gatt world trade talks.
During next week's talks, both sides will discuss how to give fresh impetus
to the Gatt Uruguay Round, focusing on improving market access through lower
tariffs.
EC officials expressed disappointment yesterday with US tariffs proposals,
but said President Bill Clinton's decision last week to press ahead with
'fast track' negotiating authority for the Gatt round was encouraging.

FT  17 APR 93 / Clinton offers Dollars 4bn cut to spending plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday offered to cut about Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) from his Dollars 16bn economic stimulus package, but Senator Bob
Dole, Republican leader, promptly rejected the compromise and again demanded
offsetting spending cuts.
Mr Clinton's new approach, made 'reluctantly' according to the White House,
is intended to break the Republican filibuster and will be first tested in a
Senate vote on Tuesday.
The White House said the essence of the jobs creation proposals remained
intact, as did the immunisation and Aids programmes to which the Republicans
have objected as inappropriate for economic stimulus. The administration
also added yesterday another Dollars 200m for recruitment of more policemen.
Mr Clinton, who has been lobbying intermittently to break the filibuster,
criticised the 'unwillingness of the minority' to appreciate the need to
create more jobs. The White House spokesman said 'the ball in now in the
Republican court.'
The latest data yesterday provided further evidence that the economic
recovery had begun to lose some steam. Industrial production last month
remained unchanged from February, breaking a run of five consecutive monthly
advances. In February the index had risen by 0.6 per cent and in January by
0.3 per cent.
The mid-March blizzard that shut down much of the east coast particularly
affected textiles, steel, furniture, tobacco and clothing.
The Commerce Department also reported a fractional widening in the US
merchandise trade deficit in February, to Dollars 7.2bn from Dollars 7.16bn
in January. Exports and imports were virtually unchanged, but the export
growth rate turned negative, mostly a reflection of weakened demand among
the main US trading partners.
The figures, announced just before Mr Clinton was to meet Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in the White House, showed the US
deficit with Japan growing to Dollars 4.13bn in February from Dollars 3.90bn
in the previous month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN voters look set to endorse a major change in the electoral system in
Sunday's referendum that proposes to reduce the importance of proportional
representation and introduce the principle of majority voting in the Senate.
As the referendum campaign closed last night opinion polls indicated a
majority of the 48m voters backed a reform of the voting system. But the
polls also showed continued widespread uncertainty.
This has been blamed at least in part on the fact that seven other issues
are being voted on the same day - ranging from de-penalising personal drug
use and ending state funding of political parties to the abolition of the
ministries of agriculture and tourism.
A survey by pollsters Doxa published yesterday showed 57 per cent in favour
of a change in the voting system, 10 per cent against and 33 per cent
undecided.
Polls, only ever approximate in gauging Italian voter intentions, have
consistently given a majority for the change but the percentages have varied
widely.
With polling stations also open on Monday, the result will not be known
until late that night. But already yesterday there were signs that Mr
Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, was preparing the ground for significant
changes in government next week in the aftermath of the referendum.

FT  17 APR 93 / Bankruptcies rise in Japan

THE SLUMP in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll on
companies, with a sharp rise in corporate bankruptcies last month and a
further fall in confidence among small businesses.
There were 14,441 corporate failures in the year to the end of last month,
up 22.7 per cent from the year before, according to a report by the Teikoku
Databank, the private research company. The rise in bankruptcies is
increasingly concentrated among smaller companies.
In spite of the rise in the number of business failures the combined debts
of the companies involved fell by 4.2 per cent to Y7,445bn (Pounds 43bn).
The rise in bankruptcies was mainly accounted for by a 42.7 per cent
increase in manufacturing failures, a 29 per cent increase in failures in
the service sector and a 22 per cent rise among construction companies.
In March there were 1,340 bankruptcies, up 18.2 per cent from the year
before and 20 per cent up on February.
The severity of the slump among smaller companies was reflected in Ministry
of International Trade and Industry figures which show small business
confidence declined sharply in the first three months of the year.
A Miti survey of more than 17,000 small companies found that business
confidence fell to minus 36.6 per cent from minus 32 per cent in the
previous three months. The index measures the percentage of companies
reporting an expected improvement in business conditions, minus the
proportion of pessimistic firms.
The sales index for the three months to the end of March stood at minus 35.5
per cent, down from minus 28.9 in the final quarter of last year, while the
pre-tax profits index stood at minus 39.8 per cent, compared with minus 34
per cent in the previous quarter.

FT  17 APR 93 / Asian economies head for growth spurt: Asian Development
Bank survey credits strong performance from China

DEVELOPING Asian economies are likely to grow at more than 7 per cent a year
in 1993 and 1994 and to continue outperforming other regions of the world,
according to Asian Development Outlook, the annual survey published
yesterday by the Asian Development Bank.
Gross domestic product in the 26 Asian countries covered by the report
increased by 7 per cent last year, up from 6.1 per cent in 1991.
The Manila-based ADB attributes Asia's success to:
Strength of the Chinese economy.
Growing importance of intra-regional trade and investment.
Continuation of rapid export growth through greater market penetration and
diversification.
Rise of domestic demand.
Upgrading of technology and increased productivity flowing from foreign
direct investment.
Widespread adoption of policies promoting competition and efficiency.
Exports from developing Asian countries rose 13 per cent last year - twice
as fast as world exports - to reach Dollars 555bn (Pounds 367.5bn), while
inflation fell to 6.7 per cent from 8.4 per cent in 1991.
The Asia-wide figures embrace divergent performances: the Chinese economy
grew by a remarkable 12.8 per cent last year, after 7.5 per cent in 1991,
while the growth rate for the four newly industrialising economies (Hong
Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan) slipped to 5.3 per cent, the lowest
since 1985 and down from 7.3 per cent in 1991.
South Asian economies recovered strongly last year, with the regional growth
rate rising to 4.7 per cent from 2.1 per cent.
Although the ADB praised the broad thrust of economic policy in Asia - and
published a section in its report analysing the continuing development of
capital markets and the tax reforms being undertaken throughout the region -
it also warned that future growth could be stunted by the deadlock in world
trade negotiations and by a shortage of investment in infrastructure.
Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, ADB president, criticised the congestion and pollution
suffered by Asian cities in his foreword to the report.
'The pressing need for additional infrastructure investment is apparent
nearly everywhere,' he said.
'If not addressed quickly, bottlenecks in power, transport, communication
and urban services could well become a drag on future economic growth.'
Chinese economic growth is forecast to remain in double digits, but the ADB
predicts that the rate of expansion will decline from last year's level
because of such bottlenecks and a rising rate of inflation.
'To avoid the emergence of excess demand and an overheated economy' the
report urges China to establish a strong, market-oriented system of
macroeconomic management that uses indirect instruments, including interest
rates and bank reserve requirements, rather than direct controls on credit
expansion.
The report forecasts that Chinese exports will continue to grow at annual
rates of 15 to 16 per cent, largely as a result of new production financed
by foreign investment.
Chinese imports will rise even faster - at 20 or 25 per cent a year - and
the current account surplus is expected to shrink this year and poss-ibly
turn into a deficit in 1994.
India's economy is expected to grow by between 5.5 and 6 per cent annually
over the next two years, the ADB says, while Malaysia and Thailand are
likely to be the star performers in south-east Asia with annual GDP growth
of around 8 per cent.
The report acknowledges the validity of some Asian fears about the creation
of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and
Mexico, noting that manufacturing wages in Mexico are highly competitive
with those of Asian exporters and that investment funds might be diverted to
Mexico from Asia.
But it says that proposed lower tariffs within Nafta may have only a minimal
effect in diverting trade from Asia because tariffs between Mexico and the
US are already 'quite low'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's Bundesbank, said yesterday the
Maastricht treaty had created tensions because some countries felt
threatened about loss of national identity and the road towards full
political union remained undefined.
'Just how uncertain people are in assessing the treaty is reflected in the
outcomes of the referendums in Denmark and France, perhaps even in the
avoidance of such referendums in other countries,' he said. 'The essential
debate on Europe's future political shape, a federal state versus a
federation of states, has not even reached major parts of the general public
as yet.'
Mr Schlesinger warned that uncertainty regarding further developments
towards political union, had a direct impact on plans for monetary union.
In a speech to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, Mr Schlesinger set
out Bundesbank reservations about the pace of European political union and
monetary union. 'I believe it to be short-sighted simply to regard European
monetary union as the logical conclusion to the process of economic
integration. Monetary union is rather a step with a significance of its very
own. A single market can exist and be beneficial without inevitably
requiring further moves towards integration in the monetary sphere.'
He also warned that the creation of a completely independent European
Central Bank as a plank for monetary union was not a 'cure-all' for ensuring
price stability. 'Monetary policy cannot reverse a grave misdirection of
fiscal and wage policies. Anti-inflation policy cannot be reduced to the
problem of providing the proper set of technical instruments.'
The Maastricht treaty has already established four criteria for entry into
monetary union. But Mr Schlesinger, quoting Chancellor Helmut Kohl, repeated
that there was 'no side entrance for candidates who do not meet the
stringent prerequisites'.
The Bundesbank president questioned how consensus on the need for currency,
budgetary, and fiscal stability could be achieved once monetary union has
been established, particularly following the uncertainity arising from
political union.
IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, indicated yesterday it
would focus its pay campaign in east Germany on enterprises it believes can
afford to meet the union's wage demands. Its leaders will decide on Monday
on a ballot of members in eastern Germany for an all-out strike in support
of higher wage increases.

FT  17 APR 93 / Palestinians to seek peace talks postponement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PALESTINIANS said yesterday that they would seek a delay in the resumption
of Middle East peace talks scheduled to open in Washington on Tuesday.
The proposal, in protest at Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians, was
put to a meeting of the four Arab delegations to the peace talks who
gathered in Damascus yesterday for a two-day meeting aimed at reaching a
joint response to the US-Russian invitation.
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to return to the
negotiating table, but are reluctant to resume bilateral talks with Israel
in the absence of the Palestinians.
Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, who heads one of three PLO factions directing the
Palestinian negotiators, said in Damascus: 'We did not say we are leaving
the peace process. We are not quitting. All we are saying is let us postpone
for a short period of time - we insist a short period of time - in order to
reach a compromise.'
He added that Israel's recent closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
had caused serious hardship by stopping 100,000 Palestinians crossing to
work in Israel, had added a further obstacle.
'We have not received any clear and concrete answers,' Mr Abed-Rabbo said.
'There are various promises and ambiguous suggestions which do not convince
us or convince Palestinian public opinion.'
In the occupied West Bank, two Arabs died and seven Israeli soldiers were
wounded yesterday when a bomb exploded in a roadside cafe. The attack
appeared to be timed to increase tension in the run-up to the peace talks.
Security forces said that an Arab had driven a truck at the cafe and had
died when it exploded, causing serious damage and setting fire to vehicles
parked nearby.
The Palestinians whose expulsion from the West Bank and Gaza in December
provoked the crisis in the peace process, launched their own protest
yesterday by marching from their makeshift camp in south Lebanon towards
Israeli military positions.
Israeli troops responded with artillery and tank fire and the march was
called off several hundred metres short of the positions after a shell
injured one of the marchers.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the
peace talks, said in Washington after two days of talks with US officials
that it was not possible at this stage to recommend a resumption of the
negotiations.
The Palestinians have been pressing Israel to accelerate the timetable for
allowing the men expelled to Lebanon to return home. They also want a
commitment from Israel that it will not again carry out mass expulsions.
President Bill Clinton has promised that the US will become more closely
involved in the peace talks and together with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has expressed hope
that substantial progress can be made this year.
All sides have also agreed that no time limit will be placed on the next
session, the ninth since the inaugural meeting in Madrid in October 1991.

FT  17 APR 93 / UN prepares for Srebrenica's evacuation: The enclave's fall
would be a devastating blow to Moslem-led forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UN RELIEF workers yesterday finalised plans to evacuate tens of thousands of
civilians from Srebrenica, as Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on
the enclave in eastern Bosnia.
The fall of Srebrenica would be a devastating blow to the Moslem-led Bosnian
forces. One of the few remaining strongholds in the once mostly Moslem
region of eastern Bosnia, it has become a symbol of resistance against Serb
forces.
Conflicting radio messages yesterday were the only reports out of
Srebrenica, cut off from the outside world for a year by a Serb siege.
Crowded with Moslem refugees from the Serb onslaught on neighbouring towns
in eastern Bosnia, Srebrenica's population has swollen to some many times
its original size.
Bosnian leaders broadcast desperate appeals to the outside world for help in
defending the town. 'It is a question of hours. . . of whether they will be
slaughtered or run over by tanks,' said Mr Stefan Siber, a Bosnian official.
Amateur radio reports received in Sarajevo said Serb forces had stepped up
their shelling of the town. They described panic among the battered
population, hiding in underground shelters. Most are hungry, suffering
scabies and body lice. 'In the name of God, do something,' said one
Serbian TV said Serb forces had come within 1km of the town. UN reports said
Serb attacks had subsided to two shells an hour, in the foothills of the
Drina River valley. 'We have been saying since February that Srebrenica
would fall if some protective measures were not taken,' said Mr Laurens
Jolles of the Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is likely that Serb forces, after seizing control of Srebrenica, would
seek to advance on the two other Bosnian government strongholds, Gorazde and
Zepa, to the south.
This would further undermine the international peace plan on Bosnia which
envisages Moslem control of most of eastern Bosnia, on the frontier with
Serbia. Bosnian Serbs have rejected the proposed maps because it separates
Serb-designated provinces from Serbia.
The fall of nearby Kamenica, which cut off a vital route to Srebrenica, left
it completely vulnerable. Further, Croat forces severed supply lines into
Moslem-held territory which helped Serb forces advance on the badly
outgunned Bosnian fighters.
UN officials believe an artillery attack on Srebrenica on Monday, which
claimed at least 56 lives, left local military leaders reeling with little
hope of defending the town. 'I saw bodies everywhere. The streets had been
packed with people, taking advantage of a lull in the fighting to get out
because they live in hellish conditions,' says Mr Louis Gentile of the
UNHCR, who was in the town centre.
'Serb artillery guns pounded the town from north to south for over an hour
in an attack clearly designed to hit the main street. They (Serb forces) can
probably lob the odd shell without orders. But for the mass and systematic
shelling, approval must have come from above,' he added.
Refugees from Srebrenica tell how special forces from the Yugoslav army have
been operating around the town. 'The people who are attacking us are not
from Srebrenica. I lived there; I know who is local and who isn't. They are
from Serbia,' said Mrs Azreta Habibovic, a Moslem refugee who recently fled
Srebrenica to Tuzla.
UN officials have confirmed reports of Yugoslav Army presence in the area.
Diplomats based in Belgrade also say there is evidence of army involvement
crossing from Serbia to Skelani, just south of Srebrenica.

FT  17 APR 93 / Yeltsin comes under attack on two fronts

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia sustained attacks on two fronts yesterday,
as his vice president accused the president's closest associates of
corruption and Russian industrialists laughed at his claim that the worst
was over in the economy andinflation was going.
The ferocious attack from General Alexander Rutskoi, in his capacity as
inter-departmental fighter against corruption to the Russian Supreme Soviet,
accused Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, head of the federal information service, and
Mr Gennady Burbulis, former first deputy prime minister and until recently
the closest of Mr Yeltsin's advisers, of being involved in crime rings.
Mr Burbulis, he alleged, was implicated in the 'Red Mercury' scandal, in
which a company in Ekaterinburg (the former base, as Sverdlovsk, of Mr
Yeltsin) called Promecologia had received monopoly export rights for
mercury.
Mr Poltaranin was implicated in the theft of money for the sale of former
Red Army property in Berlin, and in the diversion of German aid to the
Russian military to build houses, he said.
Making explicit the link between criminal circles and radical reform, Gen
Rutskoi told parliament that officials most involved in corruption 'are very
interested that the present course of reform be maintained, since it's
filling their pockets'.
Striking the populist note which could make him a formidable electoral
opponent for Mr Yeltsin, Gen Rutskoi said: 'The people of Russia were robbed
twice last year: once because of shock therapy and the liberalisation of
prices, and once because of those sums of money and resources which, without
any control, were sent abroad.'
Mr Yeltsin hinted this week that he would ask Gen Rutskoi to resign.
Mr Yeltsin's humbling before a 4,000-strong gathering of the Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in a hall within the Kremlin came when he
claimed inflation had dropped from nearly 30 per cent in January to 17 per
cent in March. The last figure was drowned in a chorus of jeers and
catcalls. 'I don't understand. . . ', said the president, turning to Mr
Arkady Volsky, the union's president, for assistance.
Inflation, according to figures compiled by the state statistical service
Goskomstat, has come down in the first quarter, though its estimate is 21
per cent for March. The underlying rate of credit expansion, the root cause
of inflation, has itself come down sharply, to as little as 10 per cent in
February from highs last year of over 30 per cent a month.
As Mr Yeltsin came under fire in Moscow, leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States yesterday produced an orchestrated chorus of support for
the Russian president.
The meeting in the Belarussian capital of Minsk, called by Mr Yeltsin to
decide the future of the CIS, became a campaign rally for the president a
little more than a week before his crucial constitutional referendum on
April 25.
Even President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, a bitter critic of Russian
policy, was induced to endorse Mr Yeltsin as the best Russian president
Ukraine was likely to get. He said the referendum would determine whether
the Commonwealth would continue to exist and added that 'there are forces in
Russia which want a return of the Soviet Union, but that way lies
bloodshed'.
Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov said: 'We fully support the Russian
president even if we do not support every action of his government.' There
was no overt disagreement but it is doubtful that this unity will survive a
more detailed examination of Mr Yeltsin's proposals in a month.
Mr Yeltsin could gain the support of 60 per cent of voters in the referendum
on April 25, according to polling by the Gallup organisation.

<TEXT>
GERMANY will not take part in any Nato-backed selective bombing in the
former Yugoslavia because of constitutional constraints and its legacy in
the Balkans in the second world war, the Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
Although the constitutional court last week allowed German-manned Awacs
aircraft to help impose a United Nations no-fly zone over Bosnia, the
ministry stressed this was a 'one-off' arrangement.
'We fully understand the emotion and engagement of David Owen facing these
terrible pictures of the Serb offensive in Srebrenica. We have lost any
belief in the Serbs' will to find an honest and peaceful compromise,' said
Mr Hanns Schumacher of the Foreign Ministry. 'The next step can only be the
tightening of the sanctions, although the idea for selective bombing has
been proposed before.'
'As regards military steps by Germany in the former Yugoslavia, everybody
knows (about) our constitution and our historical burden. We do not want to
participate in a public debate about our participation.'
Germany's involvement in military activities outside the Nato area is
constrained by the interpretation of the constitution.
Even if the constitution was amended to state specifically Germany's
military role in the post-cold war era, Mr Schumacher said, 'there is a
clear majority' in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, against
involving German solders in Yugoslavia.
A Nazi-backed regime was set up in Croatia during the second world war.

Farmers' leader Mr Heikki Haavisto will replace Mr Paavo Vayrynen as Finnish
foreign minister, a senior government official said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Helsinki. Mr Haavisto is known to be a critic of proposed
Finnish membership of the European Community although he is showing signs of
softening his anti-EC stance.
Finland applied to the EC in March last year and the government aims for
membership in 1995 after a referendum. But public support for joining the
Community has declined.
Mr Vayrynen said this week he would leave the four-party coalition
government led by his agrarian-based Centre party to concentrate on
campaigning for the presidential election in January next year.

<TEXT>
IRELAND'S Central Bank yesterday reduced its short term facility (STF)
interest rate by half a percentage point to 9 per cent, the seventh
reduction in the official rate in eight weeks, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
The STF is the rate which underpins wholesale money market rates and is now
at its lowest level in four years.
Wholesale money rates in Dublin soared to as high as 100 per cent during
autumn's ERM currency crisis, as the Central Bank struggled to defend the
punt against speculative attacks and exhausted its foreign currency
reserves.
The punt's devaluation in January however, and the easing of German interest
rates, has since enabled the Central Bank substantially to rebuild reserves
and therefore sharply to reduce interest rates in the Irish market.

FT  17 APR 93 / World Bank, IMF wage bills to rise by 6%: Institutions
defend pay increases against opposition of rich member countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have voted
for a pay increase that will increase wage bills at the two Washington-based
institutions next year by more than 6 per cent.
Despite opposition from the US, UK, Canada and Australia, which together
represent a third of the voting capital of the IMF and World Bank, the two
boards this week approved a pay increase of 4.6 per cent with effect from
May 1.
This will result, because of additional recruitment and pension costs, in a
rise of 6.9 per cent in the IMF's total personnel bill, budgeted at Dollars
273m (Pounds 180.7m) for the year ending April 30.
At the World Bank, staff costs will rise by 6.2 per cent from Dollars 804m
budgeted for year ending June 30.
Bank and Fund officials said the pay rises were based on comparisons of
public and private sector salaries in the US, France and Germany, collected
by Hay Associates, a consulting company. The move, at a time when the US
plans to freeze federal workers' pay and other countries are actually
rolling back civil service salaries, was attacked by outside critics of the
two institutions as well as by some inside the two institutions.
'Considering that the donor countries are financing an institution that is
not performing well, to pat themselves on the back and give themselves a
raise is not the thing to do,' said Ms Peggy Hallward of Probe
International, an environmental group that has criticised many World Bank
projects in the developing world.
'We can't restrain our appetites,' added one Bank official.
The World Bank and IMF pay rise also follows a week of intense criticism of
lavish spending at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a
similar multilateral financial institution. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, have raised questions about EBRD salaries, travel and office
expenses.
Opponents of the pay rise believe it is particularly unfortunate because it
could increase hostility in the US Congress towards funding the US
commitment to give Dollars 3.75bn for the 10th replenishment of the
International Development Association, a World Bank offshoot which provides
loans at concessional rates to the poorest developing countries.
The administration has included Dollars 1.25bn for the first tranche of this
commitment in its budget for 1994.
Officials from the Bank and the Fund said this year's pay rise reflected
historical data. The US pay freeze would show up in next year's
calculations.
They also noted that they had to pay competitive salaries to ensure their
ability to recruit internationally, adding that staff who moved to
Washington often came with spouses who had to give up jobs in their home
countries.
Both the Bank and the Fund have often been criticised in the past for adding
subsidies, perquisites and substantial travel expenses to already generous
salaries.
Neither institution would provide salary figures, but independent guesses
estimate the average for the World Bank group's 7,000 employees at over
Dollars 70,000 a year, and for the 2,200 IMF staff at around Dollars 80,000
a year. Since non-US citizens are not subject to tax, equivalent taxable
salaries would be much higher.
Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, and Mr Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the IMF, earn Dollars 190,000 a year plus a
representational allowance of Dollars 95,000 - salaries which were
substantially increased in 1991, at Mr Camdessus's insistence, to retain
parity with Mr Jacques Attali, president of the EBRD.
Criticism of the World Bank has been particularly barbed because of its role
in helping poor, developing nations.

FT  17 APR 93 / EBRD told to provide details of spending
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 56 countries and inter-national agencies which own the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development have asked the bank's executives for a
detailed breakdown of how it spent Pounds 55.5m on furnishing and equipping
its offices.
The 23 directors of the bank, which represent these countries and agencies,
have also asked for proof that 'proper procurement policies' were followed
and that the bank received the best prices for the construction.
One director said yesterday that the bank's board was unhappy about last
year's process of fixing the budget which was eventually set at Ecu136m
(Pounds 108m) for administrative costs. The board has prepared a working
paper to ensure it receives more detailed information from the banks'
executives when fixing future budgets.
Canada's representative, Mr Don McCutchan, was so concerned he asked Mr
Jacques Attali, the bank's president, to record his refusal to approve the
1993 budget when it was passed on December 14.
The Australian representative, Mr Jim Humphreys, is also said to have
protested to Mr Attali about lax control on spending by the bank, including
the cost of its London headquarters, which the Australian government
believes was excessive.
Mr Humphreys felt so strongly about the allocation of Pounds 52,000 for a
staff Christmas party last December that he wrote to Mr Attali refusing to
attend. He felt it was an 'inappropriate' way to spend shareholders' funds.
Building contractors said yesterday the bank had spent about Pounds 2.5m on
joinery for panelling, door frames and doors. It had bought 600 desks,
designed by leading architect Norman Foster, for more than Pounds 600 each.
Mr Anders Ljungh, the EBRD's vice president in charge of finance, said that
the building had been fitted out within budget and that good prices were
obtained for all elements.
He said it was 'it was not necessarily appropriate' to order more modest
furnishings. 'We got beautiful offices for a useful price,' he said.
One director said proposals to change the budget-making process would be
implemented after the annual meeting beginning next weekend. Several
directors, including those from Canada, Australia and the UK, have been
concerned that the bank's control of overheads should be tighter.
Mr Ljungh said the bank's investments in the money markets had been so
successful last year that all its running costs of Ecu92.8m were covered by
interest earnings and dealing costs.
The bank made a profit of Ecu3.8m before Ecu10m provisions to cover possible
losses on investments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its net
loss for the year of Ecu6m was Ecu40m better than it had been expecting, Mr
Ljungh said.

FT  17 APR 93 / Clinton lectures Japan on access to markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday delivered what amounted to a public lecture
to Japan on the need for 'rebalancing' its bilateral economic and trading
relationship with the US.
Mr Clinton confirmed that the US would seek specific targets for exports in
selected markets in Japan. 'We are concerned not only by how much we sell,
but by what we sell,' he said.
His comments came at a joint press conference after morning White House
meetings with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Clinton
was complimentary about Japan's achievements and implied few disagreements
on issues such as regional security and aid for Russia. However, he focused
most of his remarks on the imperative of forging a new, economically-led
relationship in the post-Cold War era.
'Economics have been at the heart of our discussions,' he said, with Japan's
persistent trade and current-account surpluses and 'inadequate market
access' at the top of the agenda.
While recognising the complexity of many of the issues, Japan, Mr Clinton
declared, 'must accept the challenge of change as we have in the US'. Just
as the US was acting to cut its deficit, 'so it is important that Japan lead
the way to global economic growth'.
He praised the Japanese economic stimulus package as 'an important first
step', but said Japan had to understand that such actions were only part of
a continuous process, in which co-ordinated macro-economic policies played
only a role along with the removal of trade barriers.
Mr Miyazawa replied with untypical asperity. He said economic prosperity was
founded on deep and mutual economic inter-dependence, but added that 'this
cannot be realised under managed trade or under the threat of
unilateralism'. He urged US companies to improve their competitiveness.

FT  17 APR 93 / West warns Serbs as forces close in on Srebrenica: Britain,
US and France pledge early strengthening of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, ROBERT MAUTHNER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France last night agreed that stronger sanctions should
be imposed against Serbia as soon as possible.
The announcement from the British Foreign Office came amid growing fears
that the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia was about to
fall to surrounding Serb forces.
The decision to push for tighter sanctions came shortly after President Bill
Clinton said he believed the situation had now deteriorated to a point where
Russia, the UK and France would have to consider options they had previously
ruled out.
The US did not specify what additional measures it would seek, though one
unidentified Defence Department official was quoted as saying that bombing
Bosnian Serb military installations was under consideration.
In London, the Foreign Office said that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, had been in touch with his opposite numbers in Washington and
Paris. 'In view of the deteriorating situation in Srebrenica and the
seriousness of what the Serbs are doing, the three agreed to adopt a
Security Council resolution bringing in more sanctions against the Serbs as
soon as possible.'
Members of the United Nations security council were last night discussing
what measures might be taken and the timing of a full Security Council
meeting to adopt them.
Under consideration are likely to be measures to turn sanctions into a
complete economic blockade. The resolution pending before the council would
tighten sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - which form the rump
Yugoslavia - by strictly controlling traffic along the Danube and curbing
transshipments through Serbia.
It would also require UN members to impound Serbian vessels, freeze Serbian
assets, and ban all commercial vessels from entering former Yugoslav
territorial waters.
Also last night the council was expected to pass a separate resolution
proposed by non-aligned members declaring Srebrenica and surrounding areas a
safe haven with provision for UN troops to monitor the situation.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, had already told Russian
diplomats that, if the town fell, the US would not wait until after the
Russian referendum on April 25 to seek more UN sanctions. Russia and Serbia
have traditionally been allies, and Washington had originally promised the
delay in order not to jeopardise the position of Mr Boris Yeltsin, who is
seeking popular backing for his presidency.
Serb forces yesterday advanced to within 1km of Srebrenica, the former
silver-mining town which has come to symbolise Bosnian resistance against
Serbia. But there was no confirmation of reports from Paris that Serb forces
had entered the town.
Last night Bosnian leaders broadcast desperate appeals to the outside world
as terrorised civilians cowered in cellars to escape Serb artillery
bombardments. An amateur radio operator in Srebrenica reported: 'I don't
know how much longer we can resist . . . the offensive is unrelenting.'
If Srebrenica surrendered, it would probably mean the end of other
Moslem-held strongholds such as Gorazde and Zepa, to the south. Mr Kemal
Muftic, an aide to Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, said talks were
under way on the terms of surrender of the town. 'The most important thing
is to avoid a massacre,' he said.
About 50 UN lorries were on standby to evacuate tens of thousands of Moslems
from the town, whose population has been swollen to an estimated
30,000-50,000 inhabitants by an influx of refugees. During the past week
some 60 people have been reported killed by the Serb bombardment.
The US warning on sanctions coincided with a statement by Mr Hurd calling
for existing economic measures against Serbia to be tightened into a full
blockade. He also proposed the appointment of 'a heavyweight international
figure' to ensure the full compliance with and enforcement of sanctions.
Contributing to the calls for action against the Serbs, Lord Owen, one of
the international mediators for a peace settlement, said the time had come
for the world to consider the selective bombing of roads and bridges in
Bosnia, to stop supplies reaching the Bosnian Serb forces.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, backed his proposals. Mr Hurd said the British
government was not ruling out air strikes 'but we would have to be clear how
they would help'.
Six RAF Tornado fighter aircraft will leave Britain on Monday to enforce the
no-fly zone.
Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, stressed
that Serb units would not try to take Srebrenica if its Moslem defenders
agreed to disarm but his words were not being taken seriously by the UN.
A small party of Canadian UN soldiers was expected to cross Serb lines to
Srebrenica last night, a move which fuelled fears that the town was about to
fall. The UN Protection Force said the troops would try to 'avert a major
humanitarian tragedy'.

FT  17 APR 93 / Restructuring at Lloyd's to follow record loss of Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London hopes to soften the shock of another record loss totalling
more than Pounds 2bn by announcing plans within the next few weeks for a
radical restructuring of the insurance market's operations.
The Lloyd's 'business plan', however, will not provide for an immediate
settlement to the legal actions dogging the market.
Negotiations to settle out of court will continue, but Lloyd's appears to be
resigned to a continuation of more than a dozen legal actions between Names
 -the individuals whose assets support the market - and the agents who
organise their affairs.
The market's governing council hopes its new business plan will re-establish
confidence in the market by paving the way for a substantial injection of
corporate capital as early as January 1994. It is understood that Lloyd's
council has agreed in principle that corporate investors would be
'ring-fenced' from the heavy potential losses that are emerging from
liability business underwritten in the past.
The price for such 'ring-fencing' would be a higher contribution by the new
participants into Lloyd's central reserve, which meets claims when Names are
unable to fulfil their obligations. Corporate investors might also be asked
to pay an entrance fee.
Senior members of the board now acknowledge that the losses in 1990 - the
latest under the Lloyd's three-year accounting system - will total more than
the Pounds 2.06bn in 1989.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, want
the business plan to be presented before June to a meeting of all the
market's participants.
The market has suffered a sharp decline in its capital base in recent years,
but with insurance rates rising and the prospect of profits returning,
informal contacts are understood to have shown up a substantial interest
among potential corporate investors.
The plan is also understood to include a reinsurance scheme allowing
syndicates to reduce the uncertainty arising from old liability policies,
from which claims are continuing to emerge.

FT  17 APR 93 / Hopes rise of early end to rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, NEIL BUCKLEY and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES ROSE last night that the rail dispute might be resolved early next
week after union officials said British Rail appeared to be shifting its
attitude toward compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour.
The executive of the RMT union meets on Monday to decide its next move after
yesterday's second 24-hour strike, with an early resumption of negotiations
with British Rail now probable.
Union officials said last night that BR seemed to be 'edging forward' and
there was 'the basis for a restart of talks'.
The optimism came after Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, wrote to Mr John
Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, stating: 'The board has no plans
currently for any compulsory redundancies.
'No employer can give such an unqualified guarantee on job security as no
compulsory redundancies, although BR's record here is good with relocation
and retraining resulting in almost all displaced staff who wished to stay in
the industry being able to do so.'
Sir Bob added that the board could not give any unconditional guarantee to
limit contracting of services 'where this can be done safely and
efficiently'. But he pointed out to Mr Prescott that: 'We have no plans for
a major extension of the use of contractors in the area of track maintenance
during the next couple of years.
'The board is continuing to seek to resume discussions and to dissuade the
union from taking further damaging industrial action.'
Last night Mr Prescott said the letter indicated 'a change in BR's
attitude'. He called for the intervention of conciliation service Acas to
help resolve the conflict. 'There is no reason why an agreement should not
now be reached to bring this dispute to a conclusion,' he said.
Yesterday's 24-hour rail strike did not prevent thousands of railway
commuters reaching work while others took the day off or worked from home.
In London, the Stock Exchange and Lloyd's said they were not affected. Mr
Peter Stillwell, vice-president of London's Oxford Street Association and
manager of Marks and Spencer at Marble Arch, said the strike had 'a very
considerable effect' on the central London retail trade.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Strong rebound in trading
profits lifts JP Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN yesterday reported strong first-quarter earnings as a rebound in
trading profits and healthy underwriting revenues helped the New York
banking group recover from a disappointing final three months of 1992.
The bank earned Dollars 432m in the January-to-March period, although that
was reduced to net income of Dollars 295m after a previously-announced
after-tax charge of Dollars 137m related to the adoption of new standards
for the accounting of post-retirement benefits.
First-quarter profits were well up on a year ago, when the bank reported
earnings of Dollars 264m (although that was later restated as net income of
Dollars 716m to reflect changes in the bank's accounting of income taxes),
and on the final quarter of last year, when poor trading results depressed
earnings to Dollars 298m.
The biggest contribution to the improvement came from the bank's trading
business, where revenues totalled Dollars 469m, ahead of the same quarter a
year ago and the last quarter of 1992.
Both of those quarters were affected by losses on the trading of
mortgage-backed securities. In this term, however, the results were boosted
by successes in the trading of swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts,
and global (especially European) debt securities.
In a rare move for a US bank, JP Morgan chose not to make any loan-loss
provisions in the quarter. The ratio of reserves to non-performing loans
stands at about four-to-one (Dollars 1,202m to Dollars 299m), the highest of
any leading US bank.
The corporate finance division also put in a good performance, with revenues
rising 23 per cent to Dollars 119m following strong demand for the bank's
debt and equity underwriting services, both in the US and overseas. JP
Morgan is one of only a handful of US banks allowed to underwrite securities
in the domestic markets.
First-quarter profits were also buoyed by gains of Dollars 74m from the sale
of Brazilian interest bonds, which boosted net interest revenues to Dollars
432m, and Dollars 95m from the sale of foreign government and US Treasury
investment securities.
Among other revenue sources, credit-related fees rose to Dollars 54m,
investment management earnings climbed to Dollars 113m and operational
service fees for custody, clearing and brokerage activities increased to
Dollars 116m.
Operating expenses rose sharply to Dollars 809m, primarily because of higher
performance-related employee compensation payments.

profit rise

<TEXT>
HOLVIS HOLZSTOFF, the Swiss non-wovens and paper distribution group,
revealed yesterday that its 8.3 per cent rise in net profit last year to
SFr32.7m (Dollars 22.1m) was made possible by an SFr9m net extraordinary
profit on the sale of a property.
The sale more than offset the slump in profits from operations caused by a
SFr12m loss at Sodoca, the group's French subsidiary. Sodoca, the company
with which Holvis first began its diversification into the non-wovens
business in 1969, lost orders from a large customer early in 1992 due to the
inadequate quality of part of its production.
Mr Pedro Reiser, chief executive, said there had been some dismissals and
Sodoca was expected to return to profit next year.
Holvis forecast that its net profit this year would rise despite higher
invest-ment and development costs for non-woven activities.
The group, which removed all restrictions on foreign ownership of its shares
last year, said 44 per cent of its shares were now held by foreigners. The
British Rail pension fund, with 15 per cent, and Mercury International
Investment, also of the UK with 10 per cent, were the two largest.
Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium group, plans a one-for-10 rights issue.
The price of the new shares will be revealed on April 28.

Torture is still widespread and systematic in China despite the Beijing
government's claims to have instituted reforms, Amnesty International said
in a report published today, Reuter reports.
The London-based human rights group said the practice of torture had
actually spread in the last 10 years to become endemic in many Chinese
detention centres and prisoners now suffered much more severe abuses.
A Chinese government report to be submitted to the United Nations' Committee
Against Torture on April 22 makes largely false claims that torture cases
are scrupulously investigated and the torturers brought to justice, Amnesty
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Afghan prime minister-designate Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said yesterday he had
drawn up a new cabinet list to try to break a deadlock before more fighting
erupts, Reuter reports from Charasyab, Afghanistan.
His arch-rival President Burhanuddin Rabbani countered with proposals agreed
after consultations among four other main guerrilla parties.
A five-week-old peace accord among the fractious guerrilla groups has become
bogged down amid disagreement between Mr Hekmatyar and Mr Rabbani over
allocation of ministries. Mr Hekmatyar appeared to rule out any discussion
with Mr Rabbani, accusing the government of preparing for more fighting.
Under the March 7 Pakistani-brokered peace accord signed by the Mujahideen
leaders in Islamabad, Mr Hekmatyar was to finalise the cabinet in
consultation with the president in two weeks.
Mr Hekmatyar hinted that his main compromise was over Mr Rabbani's powerful
defence minister, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, who has held the job since the
guerrillas took power from the former communist government last April. Mr
Hekmatyar had vowed to sack him.
In the new cabinet list, Mr Masood is to be one of three deputy prime
ministers and is to head the foreign ministry, which will be run by a
council of all the nine main parties.

Angolan government and Unita rebel delegates met alone behind closed doors
yesterday at peace talks in Ivory Coast, Reuter reports from Adbijan.
United Nations mediators and official observers from the US, Russia and
Portugal agreed to stay away from the conference room during the first
private discussions between the warring parties.
The Abidjan talks, formally opened on Monday under UN auspices, are aimed at
stopping fighting which erupted after Unita rejected its defeat in last
September's elections.
Although all sides have reported a good atmosphere, progress was slow and a
UN official said the Angolans were avoiding divisive matters that would
'poison the situation.'
The Angolan government said it had sharply revalued the kwanza, the national
currency.
The state news agency Angop reported that as of Wednesday the official
exchange rate was adjusted to 4,000 kwanza to the dollar from the previous
7,000 exchange rate. The street market rate is above 10,000 kwanza to the
dollar.
The adjustment had long been expected following a controversial and
unsuccessful move by the previous finance minister, Mr Salomao Xirimbimbi,
to align the official and parallel market rates which effectively devalued
the kwanza.
He was sacked last month and replaced by Emanuel Carneiro.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK currency support plan set for veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS by Britain to increase support for weak currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism seem likely to be vetoed by other countries in a
move which could add a further barrier to the UK's eventual re-entry into
the system.
The suggestion was made during discussions by the European Community's
committee of central bank governors. The group is meeting early next week in
Basle, Switzerland, to finalise a report on possible ERM reforms.
Under the UK's proposal, weak currencies in the system could be helped by
joint efforts by several ERM countries, rather than the single country with
the strongest currency.
These technical moves would be a mixture of both interventions on currency
markets and changes in interest rates. Profits and losses on purchases of
weak currencies to increase their value would be shared by all the nations
in the system.
The UK suggestion, which comes close to following a policy idea from the
opposition Labour party, has received only limited support from the other 11
nations represented on the governors' committee.
One objection, voiced in particular by the German Bundesbank, is that the
proposal might reduce the pressures on countries with weak currencies to
devalue in order to remove currency strains.
However, some support for the concept of sharing out the burden of
supporting weak currencies is believed to have come from nations such as
Spain, Portugal and Ireland. These countries in recent months have been
forced to devalue their currencies during spells of market turbulence.
Britain's proposal was made during recent debate about possible changes to
the ERM in the light of last autumn's crisis on financial markets which
forced both sterling and the Italian lira out of the system.
The UK has made clear that it wants changes to so-called 'fault lines' in
the ERM as a condition for possible re-entry.
While the EC governors are close to finishing their report, a second
document on possible changes to the system was finalised this week by the
Community's monetary committee. This committee comprises officials from
finance ministries as well as central banks. Both reports are to be
presented to EC finance ministers at the end of May.
Britain's suggestion was made in part to answer criticisms from the
Bundesbank that, under current ERM procedures, the country with the
strongest currency in the system at one time is obliged to buy whichever
currency is the weakest.
That arrangement is seen by some commentators as being unfair on the country
with the strongest currency, which by buying weak ones inevitably makes an
exchange rate loss.

FT  16 APR 93 / Delors welcome for Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, said yesterday he was
confident that Swedish entry to the European community would take place on
schedule at the start of 1995.
But Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said a decision would not be taken
until 'the latter part of this year' on when to hold a vital referendum on
membership. With public opinion in Sweden running against membership and
negotiations on entry facing difficult issues such as Stockholm's high
agricultural subsidies, Mr Delors made a strong defence of the community in
a speech to the Swedish parliament.
He played down local concerns that EC rules would slash subsidies to
northern rural communities, saying Sweden's philosophy of helping poorer
regions was exactly the same as the community's.
'We can assist remote regions in particular in a way no individual nation
state can do,' he said, adding that negotiations - begun in January along
with Finland and Austria - were 'progressing well'.
At a press conference with Mr Bildt, Mr Delors, who will visit northern
areas today, said: 'I remain confident that it is possible to maintain the
schedule and have practical entry to the Community at the beginning of
1995.'
However, Mr Bildt struck a more cautious note. He said Sweden's intention
was to join by 'roughly' January 1, 1995. But he would not say when a
referendum would be held and added that no decision on the timing of a vote
would be taken until late this year when the outcome of negotiations was
clear.
If the original timetable for holding a referendum well in advance of the
September 1994 general election slips, entry to the community could be
delayed because of constitutional requirements that membership be ratified
by two successive parliaments.
Mr Paavo Vayrynen, Finnish foreign minister, resigned yesterday to prepare
his campaign as the Centre party's candidate for the presential election
next January.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, are to meet on
Monday to decide the timing of an all-out strike in eastern Germany in
support of pay increases.
Once the decision is made, the union will ballot its members in enterprises
in the five eastern German states. All-out strikes will then take place if
the union gets the support of 75 per cent of its members in any one company.
The steel employers' association Arbeitgeberverband Stahl said yesterday
that no talks were planned with IG Metall before next Monday. A spokesman
said he saw no room for compromise at the moment. 'I think the union will
strike for a few days, and having shown it can strike, it might return to
the negotiating table.'
The employers are recommending pay rises of 9 per cent this year, instead of
the planned 26 per cent in the metal and electrical sectors, and 21 per cent
in the steel sector in eastern Germany.
The planned pay rises were agreed in March 1991 as part of a move to raise
pay in eastern Germany to west German levels, but employers withdrew them on
the grounds that the economy has worsened.

FT  16 APR 93 / Major and Owen reject call to lift Bosnia arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen, one of the
international mediators for a peace agreement in Bosnia, yesterday rejected
suggestions that supplying arms to the Moslems would help resolve the
year-old conflict there.
Mr Major, answering a parliamentary question, said the weapons flow to all
sides should be cut off rather than increased.
The US has said that a partial lifting of the UN arms ban to help the
Moslems defend themselves against Serb attacks was under consideration to
put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
The public endorsement of such a step earlier this week by the former
British prime minister, Lady Thatcher, has provoked a passionate political
debate in Britain about the need for the international community to take
more decisive action to stop Serb aggression in Bosnia.
'The whole European Community takes the view that lifting the arms embargo
is not the right priority at this stage and that the fundamental thing is
tightening sanctions' against the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and
Montenegro, Lord Owen said in a BBC radio interview.
Speaking after talks in London with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special
envoy to the peace talks, Lord Owen said the danger of arming the Moslems
was that it would unleash a sophisticated arms race, with the Russians
supplying Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN Protection Force mission in
Zagreb, also said the lifting of the arms embargo was 'not a very practical
or useful idea. If you put more arms into Bosnia, you get more war.'
The international mediators have always believed Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic can play a key role in persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
plan, which only the Bosnian Croats and Moslems have signed.
At a 40-minute meeting later yesterday with Mr Douglas Hogg, a British
Foreign Office minister, Mr Bartholomew was understood to have accepted that
a decision to lift sanctions would inevitably increase the fighting in
Bosnia and might well result in the suspension of the humanitarian relief
operations.
He also conceded that it would be very difficult to get the Russians to
approve a UN Security Council resolution to implement such a step. But the
US envoy assured Mr Hogg that the lifting of sanctions was not an immediate
issue and would only be considered if tighter sanctions failed to work.
Mr Bartholomew, who later had talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, and Mr Hogg agreed that everything possible should be done to
ensure that a resolution to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia should
be pushed through the Security Council later this month, if the Bosnian
Serbs had still not signed the Vance-Owen plan by then.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: In Srebrenica, the besieged Moslem enclave
in eastern Bosnia, local authorities refused to allow the evacuation of
refugees unless the UN provided helicopters for some 500 wounded. A
spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner of Refugees said a relief convoy
was allowed to evacuate only five elderly women.
Meanwhile, Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on the town and were
reported to be within range of small arms fire.
Elsewhere, Bosnia's Croat forces sealed off key towns in Bosnia-Hercegovina
with the aim of forcing Moslem troops to withdraw from provinces designated
for Croat control under the Vance-Owen plan.

FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market decline upsets equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in international bond markets, influenced by worries that the
Bundesbank will continue to resist pressure for further cuts in German
interest rates, took the shine off a promising performance by London's
equity market.
In a generally muted trading session share prices made good early progress,
led by the Footsie future, before slipping into negative territory as
today's national rail strike loomed and the long three-week trading account
comes to an end.
But dealers said the market was ending the extended account in good shape
and there had been a marked improvement in both sentiment and the level of
genuine customer business in the market yesterday. Turnover totalled 583.4m
shares.
The new trading account is expected to bring out some strong support for the
market as recent evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is well
underway prompts the big institutions to allocate substantial funds to
equities for the second quarter. And overseas investors, particularly in
Germany, are said to be increasingly interested in the UK equity market,
focusing on recovery trends and a strong pound. Mr Ian Harnett at SGST, the
French-owned securities house, said he was much more confident that the
FT-SE 100 will go to 2,950 and potentially to 3,000 over the current
quarter.
The 100 index ended the day a net 2.4 lower at 2,839.7 while the FT-SE
Mid-250 index continued its recent bout of underperformance against the 100
index in closing 6.8 down at 3,085.9.
There was widespread enthusiasm in the market at the outset with trading
statements from a number of the UK's leading companies generally receiving a
warm reception around the City's dealing desks. The announcement from Forte,
one of the UK's leading hotel and leisure groups, of a cut in the final
dividend had been well flagged and saw the shares move up strongly.
A maintained dividend from Blue Circle plus profits from RMC ahead of the
most forecasts led to some aggressive buying of both stocks. Redland,
another of the leading building materials shares, attracted keen support
after offering shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend.
At its best, in mid morning, the Footsie 100 index was up 12 points at
2,854.1. However, a bout of profit-taking, the easier trend in bond markets,
and a slightly disappointing opening by Wall Street, which was down more
than 15 points on the Dow Jones Average shortly after London closed, saw
share prices slip back to close marginally easier on balance.
Water and electricity stocks came under the lash again, both sectors
plunging as institutions continued to cash in some of the substantial
profits in the sectors and switched the proceeds into some of the market's
underperformers. The FT-SE Actuaries water index fell 2.9 per cent while the
Electricity index dropped 1.7 per cent.
The best performer in the Footsie 100 was British Steel, responding to price
increases and a much more positive stance on the shares adopted by at least
two of the market's leading broking houses. ICI maintained its recent good
showing, the shares racing higher as US investors continued to react to the
upgraded earnings estimates instigated by one of the top US brokerage
houses.

FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market debuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First-day dealings in two recent flotations saw both stocks race ahead to
healthy premiums.
Gear and pump manufacturer David Brown made an impressive debut as placed at
170p, the shares raced forward to 209p. Profit-taking late in the session
saw the stock ease to close at 207p with a hefty 12m shares traded.
Nursing homes group Westminster Health Care achieved a more modest premium,
closing at 287p compared to the 260p issue price, which capitalised it at
Pounds 132.6m. Westminster made 6.4m shares available to the public, and
this offer was 4.8 times subscribed. Both issues were handled by BZW.
Water and regional electricity (Recs) stocks continued to tumble as
investors again shunned the sectors and dealers sought to find new levels
for the shares. Sector specialists continued to point out that the stocks
were suffering from a combination of high rating, a lack of news and the
move from defensive to cyclical shares.
Pointing out that turnover was mostly derisory, Ms Angela Whelan at BZW
added: 'Water shares remain fundamentally good value. They probably have a
little further to fall on current sentiment, but this should open up good
buying opportunities ahead of the results season next month.' Among waters,
North West dropped 15 to 502p, Southern 17 to 519p and South West 20 to 533p
and Yorkshire 20 to 556p. In the Recs, Northern slumped 18 to 517 and South
Wales 17 to 540p.
The widely expected cut in Forte's dividend was not as deep as some in the
market had predicted and that, with the enhanced scrip, left the market
relieved. The shares gained 6 1/2 to 188 1/2 p on bulky turnover of 10m.
However, many analysts remain pessimistic about the hotel market in general
and Forte's strategy in particular. Mr Mark Finnie at NatWest Securities,
one of the specialists who first forecast yesterday's dividend cut, said:
'It does not go far enough and barely gives Forte the flexibility for the
rights issue which we believe it needs to recapitalise. The real issues have
not been addressed.'
There was tired takeover heard talk around Cadbury-Schweppes, up 5 at 485p,
while another favourite candidate, United Biscuits, was spurred on by
options activity and the shares advanced 7 to 384p.
A broker's buy recommendation helped Hanson shares lift 3 to 232 1/2 p. Shaw
&amp; Co advised clients that exposure to US recovery and recent falls in the
share price made the stock attractive at 230p.
Big overseas earner Reuters Holdings eased 14 to 1302p in reaction to a
stronger pound and reports that Lehman Brothers had signed on to EBS, an
Electronic Broking System that competes with Reuters Dealing 2000-2.
An AGM statement from BP failed to ripple through to the market. In spite of
a pointed comment by the chairman about the disparity between BP's rising
share price and the pessimism of UK analysts, the stock was flat at 301p. BP
has been well supported by the US although ADR traders in London said
yesterday that enthusiasm was beginning to fade.
News of an oil discovery prompted Cairn Energy to rise 4 to 50p.
Results from cement manufacturer Blue Circle came in ahead of forecasts with
overseas trading making up for poor domestic results. One leading securities
house raised its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 140m,
pencilling in Pounds 175m and Pounds 205m for the following years. The
shares put on 3 1/2 to 241p. RMC Group also beat most market forecasts, the
shares leaping 21 to 629p.
Yorkshire Television rose sharply on little volume as speculation returned
that retailer WH Smith is poised to sell its 14 per cent stake in the group
to Granada. Yorkshire shares gained 19 to 173p, Smith 5 to 414p, while
Granada slipped a penny to 395p.
News that AT&amp;T, the giant US telecoms group, was seeking to enter the UK
telephony market predictably hurt BT, the shares dropping 6 to 420 1/2 p.
Cable and Wireless, which owns Mercury, fell 8 to 742p.
Automated Security Holdings advanced 3 to 165p after announcing sharply
improved first quarter profits.

Healthcare manufacturing group Bespak suffered a sharp fall as the company
broker cut profit forecasts in reaction to US distribution worries. The
group achieves 25 per cent of its sales through US Surgical which last week
warned of lower profits and announced significant distribution changes that
are expected to hit Bespak's sales. Subsequently BZW, cut its 1994 forecast
for the group to Pounds 13.3m from Pounds 14.5m. The shares which had
already fallen by more than 70 tumbled 66 to 561p.

Heavily sold pharmaceuticals stocks recovered some of their losses helped by
a hefty piece of chart analysis from Smith New Court.
Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome were firm as the house, which has all
three as both short- and long-term buy recommendations, argued that the
three companies were 'well positioned to deliver above average growth'.
Glaxo held out against research that claimed combinations of anti-nausea
medicines might be more effective than sole use of Glaxo's Zofran. And,
after the market closed, it was announced that Glaxo and SmithKline had
settled a long running patent dispute. Glaxo closed 7 up at 562p while
SmithKline added 4 1/2 at 413p. Wellcome lifted 10 to 729p.

<TEXT>
Heavy US interest following a strong recommendation by one New York broker
prompted ICI shares to rise sharply for the second consecutive trading day.
PaineWebber, already a keen supporter of the company, raised its
first-quarter earnings estimates and its 1993 prediction. It cites a
recovering UK economy and the benefit of corporate cost-cutting on margins.
Traders said US investors now hold less than 7 per cent of ICI shares
compared with more than 20 per cent of most of the leading internationally
traded companies. They added that there was a growing belief that ICI had
been undeservedly mauled by the UK financial community. In London ICI shares
rose 34 to 1201p.

FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery hopes lift Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN British Steel consolidated their recent recovery after two
securities houses turned more positive and one predicted the company would
return to profit this year. Having doubled in value to become the best
performer in the FT-SE 100 index over the first quarter, Steel's shares
jumped 5 to 91p yesterday on turnover of 8.1m.
SG Warburg told clients that steel price increases announced on Tuesday, and
the prospect of more to come in October, would prompt a turnaround in the
group's figures. Warburg expects a loss for the year to March 1993 but is
more optimistic about current-year performance and predicts a Pounds 70m
profit against its previous estimate of a Pounds 30m loss.
In addition, James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The
agency broker expects Steel to report a loss of around Pounds 150m for the
year to March 1993 but break even this year.
While several other brokers remain cautious, dealers said there was a
reluctance to sell the shares.

INITIAL strength in Footsie futures faded as UK gilts and international
bonds slipped and New York opened on a weak note, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 were seen in the first part of
the session. Having opened at 2,856 it gained steadily reaching the day's
high of 2,877 around 12 pm. It registered a healthy premium to cash at the
higher levels and was also said to have helped pull the underlying cash
market higher.
However, the June contract began to drift lower on weakening sentiment in
the gilts and a decline in the international bond markets. When Wall Street
registered a negative start of trading, sellers of the June contract emerged
driving it lower. It touched the day's low of 2,852 in the last half hour of
trading and it finished at 2,859, three ahead of its previous close and
around 4 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover reached 6,586 lots.
The traded options were dull, and volume fell to 24,650, against Wednesday's
36,605 contracts. The Euro FT-SE 100 option was the busier of the two index
options trading 5,361 lots, while the FT-SE 100 option saw business of 4,361
lots.
In the stock options, British Steel, the subject of a buy recommendation
from SG Warburg, was the busiest with a total of 2,124. It was followed by
Boots at 1,549.

FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares recover to finish
little changed
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices recovered from early losses yesterday to end virtually
unchanged, bringing to a close three day's of solid gains, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,455.92, well
above its low for the day of 3,437.54. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished down 0.26 at 448.40, while the Amex composite ended 1.10
lower at 419.42, and the Nasdaq composite 3.60 lower at 670.34. Trading
volume on the New York SE was 261m shares.
In recent day's the markets have been supported by declining bond yields.
Yesterday, bond yields opened higher in the wake of a stronger-than-expected
jobless claims report.
The absence of an early lead from the bond market left equities to the mercy
of corporate earnings and profit-taking. Brokerage stocks were out of
favour, as were retail issues, which were hit by rumours that the Clinton
administration will introduce a value added tax to pay for healthcare
reform.
Prices recovered in the final few hours of trading, aided by a rally in bond
prices, which pushed yields down to new lows. The bond market turned around
on the news that President Clinton is willing to compromise on his economic
plans.
Forest product stocks were buoyed by Wednesday's late news of improved
earnings at Georgia-Pacific. That company's stock rose Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 64 1/4 , while Weyerhauser, which reported its earnings yesterday,
added Dollars 1 at Dollars 44 3/4 and Louisiana-Pacific firmed Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 73 7/8 .
Declining stocks, which rose early in the week on news of big profits at
Merrill Lynch, were hit by profit-taking and a broker's sector downgrade.
Merrill fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 , PaineWebber gave up Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 26 1/2 , Charles Schwab fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8
(despite reporting record first quarter profits) and Morgan Stanley dropped
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 .
Among retail stocks hurt by talk of a new sales tax were Gap Stores, down
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 28 5/8 , Sears, Roebuck, Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 52 5/8 , and JC Penney, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 84 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were lower, with Apple down
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 47 1/4 and Microsoft down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars
87 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO prices closed little changed in heavy trading, as gold stocks gave
back part of Wednesday's gains. According to preliminary data, the 300
composite index rose 4.38 points, of 0.12 per cent, to close at 3,634.
Imperial Oil fell  1/2 to 47 7/8 . The company said it will permanently shut
down its Ioco refinery operations, resulting in a one-time charge of
CDollars 54m against second-quarter earnings.
Cameco jumped 1 1/2 to 20. The company issued a statement at the request of
the TSE stating that the results of drilling at its 50 per cent owned Fort a
la Corne diamond project 'warrant further exploration of the area.'

boosts Nikkei as Topix eases

ARBITRAGE-related buying led by the futures markets boosted equities to
intraday highs in late trading, but overall share prices ended mixed amid
choppy activity, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 142.46 higher at a session peak of 20,675.84,
after a low of 20,394.14, while the broader Topix Index of all first section
issues lost 3.07 to close at 1,589.73.
Volume was estimated at 620m shares, down from 830.2m, as advances outpaced
declines by 590 to 457 with 144 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 0.16 to 1,254.86.
Traders said that the Topix is more representative of current market
sentiment, and they doubt that the Nikkei's strength will last. An analyst
at a Japanese brokerage said that investors are waiting for stocks to
consolidate before they enter the market more aggressively.
Speculative dealers targeted non-ferrous metal stocks on reports of violence
and rioting in South Africa, together with the subsequent strengthening of
gold prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most active issue, rose Y82 to
Y972 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting by Y26 to Y532.
Sega, the video game and entertainment company, rose Y340 to Y10,100 on
reports that it will co-operate with American cable television companies to
deliver video game software to the US.
Foreign and domestic institutional investors remained subdued, awaiting the
outcome of the G7 meeting here. So far Russian reform has been a primary
focus of the G7 meeting.
Foreign exchange-rate stability gave a boost to Nikon, which ended Y35
higher at Y1,030, while Canon rose Y10 to Y1,540.
Nissan Diesel ended at Y520, up Y80, the maximum high for the day, on
reports that the manufacturer and Ibiden, a Japanese chemical company, had
made progress in developing a filter to cut nitrogen oxide emissions for
diesel engined vehicles.
NTT dropped Y20,000 lower to Y1.02m. The financial sector also suffered
losses across the board. Mitsubishi Bank declined Y50 to Y2,490, Daiwa Bank
lost Y50 to Y1,100 and the brokerage house, Nikko Securities, slipped Y40 to
Y1,040.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 25.59 to 22,178.69 in volume of 27.1m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets put in mostly strong performances with a number of
markets at or near record highs.
HONG KONG, however, turned lower as profits were taken after Wednesday's
record-breaking rally, and the Hang Seng index ended 57.70 lower at 6,732.04
in turnover of HKDollars 5.68bn.
HSBC Holdings continued to top the most active list, falling 50 cents to
HKDollars 73.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.79 to a record close of
1,731.40 in turnover which was also at an all-time high of SDollars 765.31m.
The surge in volume was attributed to demand by fund managers who are
currently underweight in Singapore.
TAIWAN saw late demand for bank shares pull the market to a sharply higher
close. The weighted index rose 119.64 or 2.61 per cent to 4,695.49 although
turnover remained thin at TDollars 31.7bn. Small investors took a lead from
institutions which began buying financial stocks in the last trading hour.
MANILA closed at an all-time high amid heavy buying of oils, on expectations
that drilling projects off Palawan, south-west of Manila, will yield
positive results. Foreign buying helped the composite index 4.4 higher to
1,583.25, surpassing the previous all-time high of 1,580.95 set on June 11.
SEOUL picked up from an easier start after an aggressive, across-the-board
late buying spree. The composite index, which lost 7.69 points during the
morning, ended 11.84 higher at 716.76.
BOMBAY moved ahead as it returned to work after Wednesday's holiday. The BSE
index rose 66.28 to 2,293.12 as the nervousness which had gripped the market
since last week's announcement of a credit policy subsided.
BANGKOK benefited from strong institutional buying of banking and finance
shares and the SET index rose 11.84 or 1.37 per cent to 874.55.
AUSTRALIA edged lower after Wednesday's surge and the All Ordinaries index
shed 0.3 at 1704.1.

FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Malaysia enjoys frantic trading
activity - Investor interest has mainly concentrated on second-line stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brokers forced to sleep in the office at night as they battle with the
paperwork of millions of share transactions; helicopters chartered to fly
scrip in from various parts of the country: the pace is frantic on the Kuala
Lumpur stock exchange.
In terms of trading volume Kuala Lumpur has outperformed New York on several
recent days. Whereas a year ago about 30m shares were being traded daily, by
the middle of this week daily volume was more than 1bn units valued at
nearly MDollars 2.5bn (Dollars 950m). Market values are considerably higher
in New York, but daily trading volume is only in the 250m to 300m shares
area.
Malaysian share prices are also at peak levels, but they have experienced a
far more modest rise. Against a figure of 644 at the end of last year, the
KLSE composite index yesterday hit an all-time closing high of 660.73
against a previous peak of 660.35 last November 5.
Tenaga Nasional and Telekom, the partially privatised electricity and
telecommunications utilities, together account for nearly 40 per cent of
market capitalisation. But trading in these stocks has been light: instead
investors have been trading unprecedented volumes of secondary stocks.
For instance, Idris Hydraulic, a financial and property holding company, has
seen its share value leap by 300 per cent. Malaysia is embarking on a number
of large infrastructure projects, including the construction of another
international airport outside Kuala Lumpur, new sewage systems and power
generation facilities. There have been strong rumours that Idris, said to be
politically well connected, might be awarded work on some of these lucrative
projects.
Renong is a larger company than Idris with interests in construction,
manufacturing and financial services. It, too, is believed to have
substantial political connections, serving in the past as the investment
vehicle of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). There are
rumours that Renong might also be awarded valuable government contracts and
trading in its shares has likewise been exceptionally heavy.
Officials insist that the present frenzied activity, which began more than a
week ago, is a reflection of the country's buoyant economy. In each of the
past five years Malaysia has achieved growth rates of more than 8 per cent
and while some slowdown is evident, most analysts predict 1993 GDP growth of
between 7 and 8 per cent.
But there are plenty of sceptics. 'The fundamentals of the economy are not
that much different from a year ago - if anything things are not looking so
good now,' said one broker. 'There's really no logical reason for all this
activity. It's just that people have suddenly decided to indulge in an orgy
of speculative buying and selling.'
Malaysia's sound economic performance of recent years has encouraged record
levels of foreign capital inflow and analysts say that the liquidity rich
banking system has been an important factor in encouraging market activity.
Kuala Lumpur has also been influenced by the generally bullish sentiment in
other regional markets, particularly Hong Kong and Tokyo. In turn the
performance of the exchange has been the main factor behind the recent rise
in Singapore, with Malaysian-related stocks being the main focus of
attention.
Concern has been expressed about Kuala Lumpur's ability to cope with the
present trading volumes. In early 1990 the exchange could not cope with a
sudden surge in volume and MDollars 250m worth of share certificates went
missing. The incident took several months to sort out and raised questions
about the exchange's management. Hence the warning from Mr Salleh Majid, the
exchange's general manager, for brokers not to trade beyond their financial
and physical capabilities.
There have been allegations that well organised syndicates involving
speculators from Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore have been launching raids on
individual stocks to ramp up the market. The exchange says that it is
closely monitoring the market and that, so far, it has found no evidence of
manipulation.
Most brokers feel that while the present trading surge is unlikely to last
many more days, the market will probably consolidate rather than experience
a steep rise or fall. 'We know it can't go on like this,' said one weary
broker. 'But it's fun to think that, for a few days at least, little Kuala
Lumpur has been outgunning New York.'

FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Intervention rate decision
knocks Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCHANGED intervention rates in Paris gave sentiment a knock yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, too, continued to reflect disappointment at the slight easing in base
rates earlier this week, as the CAC-40 index fell 26.80 to 1,988.63 in
turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Most of the day's activity took place in Total and Elf, with switching from
the latter to the former by some big US houses. Total, recently the subject
of a positive broker's note, closed FFr2 higher at FFr272, while Elf slipped
FFr2.10 to FFr368.90.
Comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, expressing a wish for
the suspension of permits to construct new large retail sites, affected
Carrefour, down FFr56 at FFr2,674 and Casion, FFr4.90 lower at FFr146.00.
Lyonnaise Dumez lost a further FFr21.40 or 4.4 per cent to FFr465.30
following Wednesday's disappointing results.
FRANKFURT's DAX index ended 2.77 higher at 1,675.21, 8.34 off its day's
high, in turnover up from DM4bn to DM5.6bn. Among the market's
superheavyweights, Daimler rose DM2.00 to DM569.50 after an intraday high of
DM571.50, Siemens by DM2.60 to DM645.60 after DM649.00 and Deutsche Bank
DM2.50 to DM713.00 after DM715.50.
Bigger moves were registered lower in the order, with Kaufhof DM16 higher at
DM478 and, in the chemicals sector, Degussa up DM6.50 to DM324, Schering DM8
better at DM767 and Henkel DM8.80 lower at DM546.20.
Mr Roderick Hinkel at Hoare Govett said that Degussa was recovering from a
fall on Tuesday, inspired by unwarranted rumours and by thoughts that
trouble in South Africa would put the platinum price higher, and Degussa's
catalytic converter business at risk.
In fact, he said, the company has made a profit on trading the metal;
secondly, Germany gets 80 per cent of its requirements from recycling; and,
finally, there has been no halt to platinum production in South Africa to
date.
AMSTERDAM was impressed by publishers, VNU outperforming with a gain of Fl
2.20 to Fl 118.20. VNU sold its printing division earlier this week.
Elsewhere in publishing, Wolters Kluwer advanced 80 cents to Fl 94.20 while
Elsevier hit a 12-month intraday high before easing slightly to close 20
cents higher at Fl 136.80.
The CBS Tendency index improved 0.4 to 109.6. ING was another of the day's
best performers as it reported a rise in 1992 profits, closing 70 cents
better at Fl 65.30.
ZURICH continued to be weighed down by the weak dollar, leaving industrial
stocks lower and the SMI index down 4.8 at 2,160.9.
Ciba-Geigy bearers remained under pressure, down SFr14 to SFr623, while
Nestle bearers were SFr5 easier at SFr1,140.
Among engineers, Sulzer gained SFr16 to SFr726 on a bank's buy
recommendation.
Investment banks were also firm against the trend after March figures showed
sharply higher bourse trading volumes. The day's most active issue, Leu
Holding which is losing the chief executive of Leu Bank to Swiss Bank, rose
SFr6 to SFr417.
MILAN was uncertain, the Comit index edging 3.99 lower to 508.32 in largely
technical trading connected with today's end of the monthly account.
Volume remained low ahead of this weekend's referendum on electoral reform,
in which a vote in favour of change is viewed as a foregone conclusion.
However, the size of the majority will be crucial in laying the ground for a
new government to tackle the country's political and economic problems,
which will provide the lead for the future direction of the bourse.
VIENNA saw a fall in the ATX index of 4.59 to 775.27. Austrian Airlines fell
another Sch20 to Sch1,530 ahead of today's 1992 results, which are expected
to show a loss for the first time in 20 years.
ISTANBUL firmed 1.5 per cent after Wednesday's pause for breath, leaving the
market to close at its seventh record high this month. The market index
added 102.2 to 6,962.52.

FT  16 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen recaptures lost ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN yesterday recaptured some of the ground it had lost to the US dollar
on Wednesday amid signs that US officials would still like to see the yen
strengthen to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, writes James Blitz.
Earlier in the week, the announcement of a Y13,200bn fiscal package to
stimulate the Japanese economy appeared to have brought the upward march of
the yen to a halt. In Thursday's Tokyo trading, the dollar strengthened
against the Japanese currency and, at one stage, was even testing the Y114
level, having hit a new record low of Y112.58 on Monday.
The situation changed in yesterday's European trading, however, as more
detail became known about the US response to the fiscal package.
There was a strong focus on a report in the Washington Post newspaper,
suggested that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, might signal
that Japan is prepared to let the yen rise following his meeting with
President Bill Clinton today.
This helped the yen back up to a London close last night of Y113.20 to the
dollar, from a previous Y113.95. The yen was also stronger against the
D-Mark, however, closing at Y70.62 from a previous Y71.66.
Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism was calm, in spite of
what seemed rather hawkish comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president.
Mr Schlesinger said that, if higher interest rates could not help relieve
pressure on weaker ERM currencies, the only solution would be for them to
devalue. He was also reported as saying that the Bundesbank would continue
to lower its interest rates gradually.
The comments had little impact on ERM currencies. There were rumours that
the Bundesbank had announced a press conference to follow next Thursday's
council meeting, but a Bundesbank spokesman said there were no such plans.
The French franc closed a fraction stronger at FFr3.378 to the D-Mark from a
previous FFr3.380. The peseta closed almost unchanged at Pta72.07 to the
D-Mark. Sterling continued to strengthen against the D-Mark following this
week's spate of good data. It closed  3/4 of a pfennig up on the day at
DM2.4775.
However, Mr Steve Hannah, director of IBJ International in London, said the
Bundesbank president's comments might have an impact on the ERM grid in the
longer term. 'We have to recognise that, if ERM pressures did re-emerge, the
peer group of the system feels more-and-more that people should devalue
currencies at an earlier stage,' he said.
The dollar perked up against the D-Mark, helped by short-covering of the US
currency following the recent sell-off. The weekly jobless figure was dollar
positive, falling to 335,000 from a previous 373,000. The dollar closed at
DM1.6025 from a previous DM1.5915.

FT  16 APR 93 / Money Markets: Day out for rate bears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling futures fell again yesterday as dealers took the view
that another cut in UK base rates was increasingly unlikely, writes James
Blitz.
There was no concrete news to make the sterling market so modest in its view
of rate cuts yesterday. But this week's raft of good economic indicators has
robbed the cash and futures markets of their speculative edge.
Although sterling futures dealers had a relatively quiet morning, there was
a sharp sell-off in the front-month contracts at 2 pm.
The June contract fell 6 basis points on the day to a close of 94.06, while
the September contract fell 7 basis points to close at 94.15. At this level,
the market is predicting that 3-month sterling cash rates will be at 5.85
per cent by the autumn, and that they will go no lower.
There was an equally downbeat view in the interbank market, partly
influenced by a huge shortage of Pounds 2.5bn forecast by the Bank of
England.
Three-month money closed a touch firmer at 5 31/32 per cent from a previous
5 15/16 per cent. The cost of overnight lending touched 10 per cent as the
shortage proved difficult to remove, and there was late assistance of Pounds
315m.
One dealer in a London- based commercial bank said he could not remember the
market being as negative about rate cuts for many years. There are now only
15 basis points separating the December 1993 contract from most cash rates
out to 1 year.
Another dealer was more cautious. 'There is something of a recovery going on
in the Uk economy,' he said. 'But we will need more figures in a month's
time before people lose all hope of a rate cut.'
In Europe, dealers were particularly concerned by comments from the
Bundesbank President, who said that, if interest rate cuts did not relieve
pressure on weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, the
only solution might be devaluation.
The June Euromark contract consequently fell back 3 basis points to close at
92.73, nearing the lows seen in January. The June French franc contract was
up 1 basis point at 91.69. German call money rates remained firm at between
8.20 and 8.25 per cent as tax payments drained liquidity from the market.

FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low-cost CIS smelter clean-up
likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States is likely
to go ahead soon with a low-cost scheme drastically to cut pollution from
most of its smelters. It would cost about USDollars 600m, compared with
previous estimates of Dollars 6.6bn to upgrade the CIS plants, according to
Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, chief executive of the Kumera Corporation of Finland,
which would act as manager of the project.
The scheme would go a long way towards answering complaints by the European
Community's aluminium industry that it is being forced to shut down modern
smelting capacity to make way for exports from heavily polluting CIS
smelters.
Mr Kumpulainen said that Kumera, a privately-owned group with an annual
turnover equivalent to about Dollars 100m, had completed studies at some CIS
smelters that showed it would be possible, as an intermediate step, to
convert the existing Soederberg operations rather than to move completely to
the modern, so-called pre-bake technology. This could be done with
well-established technology developed by Reynolds Metals, the US group,
which had used it to convert to Soederberg smelters in its own country.
'The CIS industry can afford this scheme but the cost of converting to
pre-bake technology is not financially viable,' Mr Kumpulainen declared.
As an example of how pollution could be reduced, he said that at one CIS
smelter some 20 kg of emissions a year could be cut to only 2 kg. Upgrading
the Soederberg lines would also produce huge energy savings because the
present power efficiency of 80 per cent would increase to 90 per cent.
Ten of the 14 CIS aluminium smelters use the Soederberg process - including
the two largest, Bratsk (850,000 tonnes a year) and Krasnoyarsk (800,000
tonnes). Kumera has made proposals to them all. Mr Kumpulainen said work was
expected to start at the 60,000 tonnes-a-year Kandalaksha smelter later this
year, which would take two years to complete. It would be possible to
convert all the CIS Soederberg smelters in two to three years.
One side effect of the conversion would be an increase in the annual
capacity of each by 8 or 9 per cent.
Mr Kumpulainen was speaking during meetings here to arrange the formation of
a new organisation to promote and defend the interests of the CIS aluminium
industry internationally. Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy,
the holding company for the CIS industry, said that CIS aluminium output
this year was expected to be in line with the 3.2m tonnes produced in 1992.
He also expected that official exports would be about the same at 850,000
tonnes.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, a few days ago signed a decree
permitting the industry to export 520,000 tonnes of aluminium free of duty
to pay for its raw materials, equipment, food and other necessities, he
said. Last year's duty-free total was 650,000 tonnes. Russia was taking
steps to cut unlicensed and unofficial exports of metal by imposing new
customs regulations between itself and other members of the Federation.
Mr Prokopov pointed out that the CIS industry was producing at well below
its rated annual capacity of 3.5m to 3.8m tonnes mainly because
reconstruction was taking place at smelters to improve their performance.
However, 'political problems' in Tadzhikistan would this year reduce output
at the smelter there to between 300,000 and 320,000 tonnes, compared with
its capacity of 520,000 tonnes.

FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC import restrictions 'wrong

IT WOULD be 'wrong and ineffective' for the European Commission to impose
quotas on imports of CIS aluminium, said Mr Igor Prokopov, president of
Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, yesterday.
The commission is considering a quota system at the request of some European
aluminium producers who claim that their smelters are threatened by an
unprecedented surge in CIS exports since 1991.
Mr Prokopov pointed out the CIS industry had costs which were among the
lowest in the world but all its contracts were related to the world market
price established by the London Metal Exchange. Most exports were handled by
large, reputable western trading organisations. Also, much of the proceeds
from CIS aluminium exports were used to pay for imports of raw materials,
equipment and food for the smelters and most of these came from Europe.
If the EC forced cuts in aluminium exports from the CIS, its own exports
would suffer. In any case, there was no such thing as a 'European aluminium
market' - just a world market in which the CIS was playing a normal role. It
made no sense to put a fence between Europe and the CIS - 'it would achieve
nothing'.

FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's fishmeal industry set
for bumper profits - Production survived last year's El Nino visitation to
reach a fresh record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERUVIAN fishmeal industry is gearing up for a bonanza predicted to last
for the next two to three years. By late 1992, the sardine and anchovy that
form the staple raw material for the industry were back in abundance after
being temporarily affected by the appearance of the dreaded warm current
known as 'El Nino', which last ravaged fishmeal output in 1983.
Contrary to predictions, however, Peruvian production survived last year's
milder visitation and a late boost in fish stocks turned 1992 into yet
another record year. Peru topped the world exporters' league with 1.37m
tonnes, narrowly outstripping Chile's 1.21m tonnes.
'Statistically, the years after a Nino are excellent,' says Mr Espino of
Imarpe, Peru's maritime institute, which is charged with husbanding the
resource and recommending periodic fishing bans. Mr Espino estimates that
the Peruvian catch could be raised by a quarter or a third from the present
6m tonnes a year without detriment to the species.
'And if the fishmeal producers started going for jack mackerel - at present
only about 80,000 tonnes a year are landed, perhaps 5 per cent of total
stocks - then the sky's the limit,' he says.
The main limitation on such expansion is fleet capacity. Most Peruvian
fishing boats are small, with no refrigeration and hug the coast. When El
Nino hits, the fish move into deeper waters farther out to sea where these
boats cannot follow.
Peruvian producers say they have invested more than Dollars 200m in the past
two years in fleet renovation and plant and equipment modernisation ashore.
The industry is moving towards production of higher-quality, low
temperature, steam-dried meal with 'stickwater' plants to maximise protein
recovery. New boats with refrigerated holds are under construction in local
yards. But there's still plenty of room, and a warm welcome waiting, for new
investment from abroad.
Representatives from Chile's huge Angelini group have been in Peru recently
on 'feeling-out' visits. And Venezuelan capital has already entered in the
form of a new fishmeal joint venture under the name of Palangrera Peruana.
But the big surprise of 1993 could be the arrival of the Chinese. Pesca
Peru, the state-owned fishmeal and fishoil giant that produces around 40 per
cent of all national output, is high on this year's privatisation list.
Coopers and Lybrand, with financing from the Canadian development agency and
the World Bank, is currently completing a valuation and will recommend on
sale procedures.
Essentially, the choice is between splitting the company into its 20 plants
and four refineries to sell off individually; or selling the whole company
as one unit.
The only likely buyers on the latter basis would be the Chinese - 'and it's
a possibility that has the private producers in a state of panic', says Mr
Eric Topf, head of the Pesca Peru privatisation committee.
Unofficially, senior Pesca Peru officials say the company should fetch 'at
least Dollars 200m', a ball-park figure considered over-optimistic by
private producers.
The state-owned plants are, by and large, elderly and outdated - though
several are excellently located on the now-desirable extreme southern coast
and have their own quays. Drastic personnel reductions during 1992 put Pesca
Peru back into profit after years in the red, underlining just how
profitable producing fishmeal can be, even from scrap-yard plants.
China has established itself as far and away Peru's largest customer, buying
last year almost 60 per cent of all output. Peruvian fishmeal goes to feed
the Pacific prawn, turbot and eel which China is successfully exporting in
quantity to the US and Japan.
The Chinese are said to be producing at present some 32m tonnes of animal
foodstuffs a year, in which they use 2 per cent fishmeal - a very low
percentage compared with most competitors. A high-level Peruvian delegation
is now in China 'to try to convince them of the bounties of boosting that
fishmeal component,' says Mr Salomon Manzur, Peruvian president of the
Fishmeal Exporters' Association.
If the Chinese do increase the percentage of fishmeal in their current
animal feedstuff production, Peruvian producers will be assured of sales for
their expanded fishmeal output for several years to come.

FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia 'cannot understand'
rubber pact opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA SAYS it cannot understand the refusal of the world's natural rubber
consuming countries to renegotiate the International Natural Rubber
Agreement.
Mr Ahmad Farouk, chairman of the the Malaysian rubber research and
development board and the country's spokesman at meetings of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation, says that the consumer countries
have been inflexible and have mistakenly linked a renegotiation of Inra with
a revision of the Inro reference price mechanism.
The present agreement expires at the end of this year. Last month the main
natural rubber consumer countries - the European Community, the US and Japan
 -voted against a renegotiation saying that such a move would only be
considered if a dispute over a downward revision of Inro's reference price
was resolved.
Earlier this year producing countries - mainly Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia - opposed a 5 per cent cut in the reference price because prices
were then in an uptrend. The reference price guides the organisation's
buffer stock manager in his buying and selling of stockpiled rubber.
'I do not understand the consumers,' says Mr Ahmad. 'They insisted that the
reference price be revised first. But they know that there will be new
proposals on reference price if we go into a renegotiation of Inra.'
The Malaysian cabinet has this week been discussing what measures to take
if, as expected, the agreement collapses at the end of the year. Mr Lim Keng
Yaik, the primary industries minister, has accused the consumer countries of
not caring whether price levels are remunerative for producer countries. Mr
Lim said the consumers wanted to keep the price locked in the present low
range.
'We want Inra but not at any cost,' said Mr Lim. 'Producers must protect
themselves. They should not allow themselves to be trampled on by the rich
and powerful consuming nations.'
A last attempt to save the pact will probably be made when the
organisation's council meets here next month. Producers say if Inra
collapses they will bring in their own supply curbs and alternative pricing
mechanisms.

UKRAINE'S MINISTER of Agriculture yesterday announced that he expects
Ukraine, which last year had to import grain, to export at least 2.2m tonnes
of grain and 500,000 tonnes of sugar this year.
Seeding is drawing to a close in Ukraine and Mr Karasyk said that the
combination of good weather and the beginning of economic reforms in the
agricultural sector would lead to a good harvest.
'It has been a very beautiful spring,' Mr Karasyk said. 'The weather is
working for our independence.'
Mr Karasyk predicted that a harvest of between 42m and 45m tonnes of grain
would be gathered this year, up from last year's yield of 40m tonnes, He
forecast a Ukrainian sugar beet crop of 40m tonnes, compared with the 33m
tonnes harvested last year, when the yield was sharply reduced by drought.
The agriculture minister vowed to resign if Ukraine imported any grain this
year and said the country needed foreign investments in the agricultural
infrastructure, not credits with which to buy western grain.
Mr Karasyk said that agricultural reforms were beginning to take root with
400,000 hectares already owned by private farmers. He said that 200,000 ha
were being cultivated jointly with western investors.

BRITISH PETROLEUM Norway will see its crude oil production plunge by 36 per
cent over the next three years, according to the second annual Norwegian oil
and gas league table soon to be published by Edinburgh-based analyst Wood
Mackenzie.
Total Norwegian crude oil production is forecast to increase by 6 per cent
over the same period.
WoodMac's league table, which ranks the top 20 oil companies in Norway by
the total value of their oil and gas assets, including pipelines, also
reveals that BP Norway has dropped out of the top ten - its NKr6.553bn
(Pounds 625m) valuation having been overtaken by Conoco Norway, valued at
NKr6.743bn.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, remains the undisputed leader with
a valuation at NKr49.204bn, more than twice that of second-placed Norsk
Hydro. According to WoodMac, Statoil's most valuable assets include the
Statfjord, Gullfaks, Oseberg, Snorre and Sleipner East fields. Also included
are the Statpipe and Ulapipe pipelines, which between them contribute some
NKr9bn, or about 18 per cent, to Statoil's asset base value.
Of the foreign oil companies operating in Norway, Elf Petroleum retains the
highest ranking at number three overall, valued at NKr13.987bn, followed
closely by Esso Norge, valued at NKr13.321bn and Phillips Petroleum Norway,
at NKr11.848bn. Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent, retained sixth
place, valued at NKr9.960bn, thanks to last year's acquisitions of DNO Olje
and Norminal, two tiny domestic independents.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COTTON OUTPUT in the former Soviet republics dropped by almost 20 per cent
last year to 6.47m tonnes, the lowest level for 15 years, according to the
Commonwealth of Independent States' central statistical office. Raw cotton
production totalled 7.79m tonnes in 1991 and 9.1m tonnes in 1980.
Two-thirds of last year's total came from the central Asian republic of
Uzbekistan, with Turkmenistan, Tadzhikistan and Azerbaijan supplying most of
the rest.
The CIS statistical office cited shortages of agricultural equipment as the
key reason for falling production. Productivity was relatively inefficient
with only 2.24 tonnes of cotton collected from each hectare cultivated.
However, the collapse of trade links between the former Soviet republics and
the political unrest in Azerbaijan and Tadzhikistan have also drastically
affected the harvesting and processing of cotton.
With the former Soviet republics now increasingly determined to boost their
supplies of hard currency, exports of raw cotton have risen significantly -
last year Uzbekistan increased its overseas sales by 130 per cent to 600,000
tonnes.
At the same time trade with Russia, previously the main receiver of raw
cotton in the Soviet Union, has dropped, leaving its textile industry in
growing crisis.

FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME postpones pre-market
trading session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange has postponed the introduction of a pre-market
trading session on the floor to mop up early morning business now carried
out between traders' offices, writes David Blackwell.
The decision to put off the move was widely expected following the outraged
reaction of several ring-dealing members. 'I don't think there is any LME
ring-dealing member who sees any sense in it at all,' said one prominent
trader at the time.
The LME wanted to introduce pre-market ring trading before the end of the
year in order to give a better service to Far Eastern and Australasian
clients.
'Following extensive consultation the board has decided to postpone for the
time being the implementation of its proposal for the experimental
introduction of a pre-market ring,' LME members were told yesterday.
The original proposal sprang from a study by an LME working party into the
exchange's membership structure. The study itself was set up after
complaints by ring-dealing members that they were carrying a greater share
of the burden of running the exchange. They felt that they were facing more
risks than the non-ring dealing members, and not reaping commensurate
rewards.
The LME said yesterday that 'the board continues to examine the external
directors report on market structure'.

Three-month COPPER moved below Dollars 2,000 a tonne on the LME yesterday
morning, stimulating waves of liquidation and putting other prices under
pressure. Late bouts of bargain hunting and short covering cushioned the
earlier sharp fall. Dealers said that further losses towards recent 5 1/2
 year lows of Dollars 1,965 were likely, but should be punctuated by short
covering rallies. Copper ended the kerb at Dollars 1,979, just above the low
of Dollars 1,975. Three-month NICKEL fell below Dollars 6,000 a tonne,
triggering sell-stops. The market drifted lower on sprees of commission
house and merchant selling, before late short covering stemmed the fall.
Three-month ZINC showed some resilience in the wake of copper's decline and
looks poised to test levels above Dollars 1,030 a tonne. Three-month
ALUMINIUM clawed back some of its earlier losses after encountering solid
support near Dollars 1,130. On the London bullion market GOLD, SILVER and
PLATINUM were softer across the board, but further gains could arise today
as traders cover short positions ahead of any weekend developments in South
Africa following the murder of black leader Chris Hani.

FT  16 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally after jobs data prompts
setback
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER losing ground in early trading on news of a bigger-than-expected
decline in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury prices rallied on the news
that President Clinton is willing to make compromises over his economic
plans.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 105
3/16 , yielding 6.717 per cent, the lowest since the Treasury began issuing
30-years in the early 1970s. At the short end, the two-year note was little
changed, up  1/32 at 100 7/32 to yield 3.741 per cent.
Prices weakened early on after the Labor department announced that claims
for state unemployment insurance fell 38,000 during the first full week of
April. Analysts had been looking for a decline of somewhere between 9,000
and 15,000, so the announcement prompted a rapid, if not particularly
substantial, sell-off.
Treasuries recovered their lost ground later in the day, however, on news of
the president's willingness to compromise on his plans to help the economy.
Fixed-income investors had worried that the Clinton stimulus package might
lead to an overheated economy, and rising inflation.
SPANISH government bonds gained about a quarter of a point, shrugging off
unfavourable comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president.
Mr Schlesinger was reported as saying that if high interest rates cannot
support the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, a
devaluation may be the only solution.
'The weaker currencies, in particular, are more prone to inflationary
expectations and must, therefore, offer higher interest rates to avoid
coming under greater pressure,' Mr Schlesinger said.
'But if the tensions become too strong, only a devaluation of their own
currencies may be of help, as has happened with respect to a number of
currencies between September 1992 and February 1993.'
Dealers interpreted the comments as a reference to the peseta which has come
under pressure since Spain called an early election.
The currency weakened slightly yesterday despite intervention by the Bank of
Spain. The bond market edged up with the Meff futures contract rising from
85.88 to 86.11.
GERMAN government bonds slipped lower, with much of the selling concentrated
in the five-year area.
Dealers said market participants expect the Bundesbank to continue with its
policy of allowing small cuts in interest rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, warned that fast rate cuts could damage investor faith
in the Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy.
In addition, the market expects to see further supply next week with a new
Treuhand bond issue. Dealers expect between DM6bn and DM10bn of 10-year
bonds to be issued.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 96.24, rose to a high of
96.47 and ended the day at around 96.21.
TRADING in UK government bonds was volatile yesterday, and prices ended
lower or unchanged on a combination of supply and economic factors.
After a strong start, gilt prices fell back quite sharply. The Liffe gilt
futures contract opened at 106.15, rose to a high of 106.31, and then fell
back to 106.05 before ending at 106.10.
Dealers said few investors wanted to buy before the release of today's
inflation figures. In addition, the market expects the Bank of England to
announce plans for its next gilt auction this afternoon, with the
five-to-seven year maturities seen as a likely area for new issuance.
However, some dealers have suggested that the Bank may choose to auction a
10-year stock next.
JAPANESE government bonds closed lower, having traded in a relatively narrow
range yesterday.
The benchmark No 145 issue opened with a yield of 4.195 per cent and traded
in a range of 4.19 - 4.265 per cent before ending at 4.22 per cent. The June
futures contract ended at 108.61, compared with its previous close of
108.63.
The yen continued to strengthen against the dollar yesterday, prompted by a
Washington Post report that prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa favours allowing
the yen to rise further.

THE AUSTRIAN stock market, which has been sullied by several insider trading
scandals in recent years, is about to receive a strong dose of reform.
Within the next few months, insider trading is to be made a criminal
offence, punishable by up to two years in prison.
This, and other reforms aimed at making the country's capital markets more
transparent and efficient, were agreed yesterday by a strategy group chaired
by Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister.
The reform process has acquired urgency in recent months as investor
confidence in the Austrian stock market has continued to ebb. The Austrian
market has underperformed most leading world markets since early 1990, even
though the country's economy has been one of the most buoyant in Europe.
Mr Klaus Liebscher, president of the Borse, said yesterday that all his
priorities for improving the credibility and liquidity of the capital
markets had been accepted.
The first step will be an amendment to the Borse Law making insider trading
a criminal offence. It is expected to pass parliament in a few weeks and be
introduced during the summer. It will also oblige the police to take action
if Borse officials report a suspicious case, and will require banks to
reveal the identity of account holders if requested by a judge.
Mr Liebscher said the Borse would soon introduce a code of behaviour for its
own members aimed at preventing insider abuses, including so-called front
running, the practice of placing a house order in advance of a client order
that is expected to move the price.
The Borse would also raise listed companies' disclosure requirements,
notably to include interim and ultimately quarterly reports. And it would
set minimum levels of shares that companies must make available to the
public to maintain their listing. Measures to improve the rights of minority
shareholders were being discussed.
It hoped to have a fully computerised trading system in place by mid-1994.
Then a market-making system, in which brokers' own account and client orders
were clearly identified, could be established.
The committee agreed to set up a securities industry supervisory body, and
will spend the next few months studying experience in other countries.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: UK engineering group in
Dollars 40m private placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VINTEN, a small UK-based engineering company, has raised Dollars 40m of
10-year money through the US private placement market to refinance all its
outstanding debt.
The deal is the latest from a growing line of small European companies which
have secured long-term dollar finance privately from US insurance companies
at rates below those available elsewhere.
Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said that the company had refinanced
its entire short and medium-term debt, a large part of it taken on as a
result of two acquisitions this year, as well as raising additional cash.
The money has been provided by a single unnamed US insurance company.
The 10-year notes issued by Vinten pay a yield of 6.72 per cent, 120 basis
points above Treasuries. Vinten turned to the US private placement market in
part because it could not secure such long-term finance any other way.
'Our view is that now is as good a time as any to fix long-term borrowing,'
Mr Baggott said.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Bonds: New issues focus on continental
European currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW EUROBOND issues yesterday were concentrated on continental European
currencies, as volatile conditions in the gilts and US Treasuries market
held activity in the sterling and dollar sectors at bay.
Positive sentiment on the French bond market encouraged buying of a FFr2bn
long-dated issue for Electricite de France (EDF), the French electricity
utility. The deal, which matures in 2012, took advantage of stronger demand
for long-dated paper following the steepening of the French government bond
yield curve.
Following the French election and the latest money-market rate cuts on
Tuesday, the French yield curve is now positive, except at the short end,
with 20-year yields at 7.40, compared with 7.12 per cent for 10-year bonds.
The yield curve is expected to steepen further, but additional rate cuts are
likely to benefit the long end of the market, if less markedly than
shorter-dated bonds.
The EDF deal was launched at a yield spread of 33 basis points over the
comparable OAT yield, but strong buying by European institutions, which are
mostly bullish on the bond and currency markets, helped the spread tighten
to 31 basis points.
In the D-Mark sector, a DM200m issue for McDonald's Corporation, the US
fast-food chain, caught retail investors' attention. Although the spread of
30 basis points above the Bobl 105 series German government bond did not
appear unusually generous for a double-A-rated credit, the rarity of
McDonald's debt, and its status as a household name, sparked a rush for
paper.
The issue traded as tight as seven basis points over the Bobl, before easing
back to 14 basis points, according to lead-manager Deutsche Bank.
The deal was snapped up by retail investors in Belgium, Luxembourg and
Switzerland, dealers said.
A DM200m five-year deal for Bancomext, the Mexican bank, was also targetted
at retail investors, but was considered rather aggressively priced for a
Latin American credit.
In the dollar sector, a debut Dollars 100m issue for Corporacion Andina De
Fomento (CAF), the Latin-American supranational agency which finances trade
and infrastructure, was also the first straight offering by a Latin American
borrower with an investment-grade rating. CAF was rated triple-B by Standard
&amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, last month.
Previously, CAF, which is jointly owned by the Andean pact countries, funded
itself through the syndicated loans market, but now plans to diversify its
investor base. A small dollar offering in the domestic Colombian market is
also being prepared.
Lead-manager Chemical Investment Bank reported good demand from
institutional investors, encouraged by the investment-grade credit.
A further Latin American deal, for Loma Negra, Argentina's largest cement
company, is expected to be launched today. The Dollars 85m issue of
five-year bonds is expected to be priced to yield 480 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury issue.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser advances 55%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD US prices for timber helped Weyerhaeuser, the forest products group
based in the Pacific Northwest, produce a 55 per cent increase in first
quarter earnings, excluding special one-time gains.
Environmental constraints on logging in the Pacific Northwest, to help
preserve an endangered species of owl, have sent prices for logs, lumber and
plywood soaring this year, benefiting companies such as Weyerhaeuser with
good supplies of timber.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 229m, or Dollars 1.12 a share,
compared with Dollars 86.6m, or 43 cents a share, in the same period of last
year. Net sales rose 6 per cent, from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 2.3bn.
However, some Dollars 44m, or 22 cents a share, of the earnings were due to
a gain on the sale of the company's nappy business, while a further Dollars
52m, or 25 cents a share, was due to the extinguishment of debt.
The company's timberlands and wood products business produced Dollars 226m
of earnings, up from Dollars 111m in the same period of 1992.
However, this contrasted sharply with a drop in profits at the company's
pulp and paper business, from Dollars 75m to Dollars 35m, due to low prices
and an excess of global production capacity relative to demand.
The company said that during the quarter prices continued to erode in pulp,
containerboard packaging and bleached paperboard.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Delta seeks approval for
NY-Heathrow service
</HEADLINE>

DELTA Air Lines, one of the 'big three' US carriers, yesterday submitted a
request to fly daily between New York's JFK and London's Heathrow airports -
just four days before Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, is due
to meet his US counterpart, Mr Federico Pena, in London.
The current US-UK bilateral aviation accord gives only two US carriers -
American and United Airlines - the right to fly into Heathrow. United
acquired Pan Am's Heathrow route authorities for Dollars 290m, while
American paid Dollars 445m for routes between three US cities and Heathrow
from TWA.
Greater access for US carriers to Heathrow was one of the most contentious
issues raised last year, when possible revisions to the US-UK aviation
agreement were being proposed in the context of British Airways' planned
investment in USAir, a smaller US airline. These talks ended in deadlock,
and BA went ahead with a scaled-down investment in the US carrier.
However, the question of liberalising the accord remains on the table. Aside
from the meeting between the two ministers, formal talks on possible
revisions to the agreement are tentatively scheduled for next month.
Delta made its request in a filing with the US Department of Transportation
yesterday. It said it was prepared to begin the one-flight-a-day service by
July 15. It also claimed that 'prompt British approval of the New
York-London application would be a good-faith gesture by the British toward
the full liberalisation (of air services) which the US government must
require'.
Delta enlarged its presence at New York's JFK when it acquired Pan Am's
transatlantic route authorities, along with its terminal at the US airport,
in 1991. However, because Pan Am's Heathrow access had already been sold to
United, Delta did not acquire any New York-London authorities as part of the
deal.
Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent, adds: The UK government will insist on
establishing new rules to ensure large airlines do not abuse their market
power by squeezing out smaller competitors as a prerequisite of any further
liberalisation of air services between the UK and the US.
Mr MacGregor is expected to discuss this proposal as well as renewing
demands for an easing of existing US restrictions on foreign ownership of US
airlines during his talks with Mr Pena.
Both ministers appear anxious to revive negotiations to liberalise air
services between the two countries, interrupted after the US presidential
elections last year.

Apple net
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FEROCIOUS price war in the US personal computer industry led Apple
Computer yesterday to report an 18 per cent drop in second-quarter net
income, despite strong demand for its products.
The company said net income totalled Dollars 110.9m, or 92 cents a share,
compared to Dollars 135.1m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, in the same period of
last year.
Revenues, however, rose 15 per cent to Dollars 1.97bn from Dollars 1.72bn.
The company's gross profit margin dropped to 38.5 per cent of net sales,
compared with 44 per cent in the second quarter of 1992. It blamed this on
new product introductions and 'pricing actions aimed at aggressively
positioning Apple for faster unit growth'.
The company has been suffering a shortage of products because of the
introduction of new machines and short supplies of strategic components.
But it said these problems eased toward the end of the quarter and it
believed it was 'well positioned for revenue and unit growth in the second
half'.
Mr John Sculley, chairman, said that 'demand for Apple systems remains
strong, our revenue growth accelerated during the quarter, and we are
growing market share'.
Sales volume of the company's Macintosh PC products rose 38 per cent in the
second quarter relative to last year, with US sales up more than 50 per
cent.
For the first six months Apple reported net income of Dollars 272.2m, or
Dollars 2.25 a share, compared with Dollars 301.1m, or Dollars 2.45 a share,
on revenues up from Dollars 3.58bn to Dollars 3.97bn.
Domestic net revenues grew more than 23 per cent in the second quarter,
compared with the same period of 1992, and the company said net
international revenues were also growing.

LIPPO Ltd, the listed holding company of Indonesian tycoon Mr Mochtar
Riady's Hong Kong empire, announced a 1,202 per cent increase in net profits
to HKDollars 211.02m (USDollars 27.29m) in 1992, up from HKDollars 16.2m in
1991.
During the year, the group underwent heavy restructuring. It hived off the
Hong Kong Chinese Bank as a separate listing, and purchased controlling
stakes in four other Hong Kong-listed companies, Hong Kong China, Asia
Securities, Morning Star and Hong Kong Building and Loan.
Expansion was funded primarily through the issue of new shares. Mr Li
Ka-shing's Cheung Kong group was issued with HKDollars 300m in convertible
loan stock during the year. Further equity or convertible placements were
made to the Riady family, to China Resources, the mainland group, and to
outside investors.

IMPROVED newspaper advertising revenues helped Gannett, the US publisher of
82 daily newspapers - including USA Today - to achieve a first-quarter 1993
net profit of Dollars 66.3m, or 46 cents a share, compared with a loss in
the same quarter of 1992 of Dollars 91.4m, or 63 cents a share.
The company's 1992 first-quarter loss occurred after Dollars 146m of
accounting charges. With these stripped out, the 1993 first-quarter net
profit was 22 per cent higher than the level a year before.
Gannett's group operating revenues grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 844.7m
year-on-year, while operating income was Dollars 120.1m in the first
quarter, some 16 per cent higher than a year ago.
Newspaper advertising revenues were 9 per cent higher in the 1993 first
quarter, at Dollars 465m. Classified advertising volume was nearly 6 per
cent better in the quarter.
Signs that the US media industry is emerging from the worst of the recession
were apparent at USA Today, the popular national daily paper. USA Today's
paid advertising pages rose by 29 per cent year-on-year, while advertising
revenues were 21 per cent better.
Broadcasting revenues at Gannett, which includes 10 television and 15 radio
stations in the US, grew by 5 per cent, to Dollars 82.9m.
Outdoor advertising revenues, a Gannett speciality, declined by 8 per cent,
to Dollars 47.8m. This reflected in part the sale of a business in Arizona.

MICROSOFT, the leading US personal computer software company, beat analysts'
expectations with a 35.8 per cent jump in third-quarter net profits to
Dollars 243m, or 80 cents a share, helped by the popularity of its Microsoft
Windows and MS-DOS operating systems.
A year earlier, Microsoft earned Dollars 179m, or 69 cents. Revenues in the
three months to March 31 soared nearly 41 per to Dollars 958m. Most analysts
had expected earnings of about 78 cents a share.
For the first nine months, Microsoft earned Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28 a
share, up 38.1 per cent from Dollars 498m, or Dollars 1.70, a year earlier.
Nine-month revenues grew nearly 40 per cent, to Dollars 2.71bn from Dollars
1.94bn.
Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said: 'We have expanded core
businesses, introduced new product lines and maintained our emphasis on
operating efficiencies.'
Microsoft has licensed more than 25m copies of its Windows operating system
since its debut in 1990. Windows is pre-installed in about 60 per cent of
personal computers.
Earlier, Microsoft announced an agreement to work with Compaq Computer to
make personal computers which are easier to use.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits down at SA Gold Fields'
mines despite price rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOLD mines in the South African Gold Fields group performed disappointingly
during the March quarter, with net profits slightly lower despite a firmer
gold price and successful containment of costs. After-tax profits fell to
R267.4m (Dollars 84m) from R270.2m in the December quarter.
At the operating level, however, the group improved, with operating profits
rising by 9.5 per cent to R330.8m from R302m.
The quantity of gold produced was largely unchanged at 30,575kg compared
with 30,661kg, but sales revenue rose to R1bn from R981.9m due to a better
average gold price of R32,716 per kg, up from R31,988 per kg. Production
costs fell to R21,934 per kg from 22,175 per kg.
The group results suffered, however, from a fall in net sundry revenue to
R13.98m from R42.5m in the previous quarter, when the figure was boosted by
seasonal dividend payments and fire insurance pay-outs.
Driefontein, the group's largest mine, had a better working quarter, with
East Driefontein recovering from a poor December performance. Mr Alan Munro,
executive director, said West Driefontein had shown an improvement, 'but not
enough'. Net profits rose to R139.7m from R137.4m.
At the Kloof mine, a good performance from the Kloof division was offset by
a R10.5m operating loss at the recently-integrated Libanon division. This
was the result of disruption to production caused by a fire. Mr Munro said
he was determined and confident that the division would soon be paying its
own way.
Fires also affected production at Deelkraal, which, in Mr Munro's words, had
'a very poor quarter'. A 20 per cent decline in the ore milled fed through
to the bottom line, with after-tax profit falling to R3.4m from R13.7m the
previous quarter. This compares to capital expenditure during the quarter of
R10.6m.
The marginal Doornfontein mine turned a R6m loss the previous quarter into a
R3.4m profit thanks to clean-up operations. The mine is heading towards
becoming a surface dump operation, in which old waste dumps are reworked to
extract residual gold, and Mr Munro said the possibility of closure remained
strong.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S has downgraded the long-term debt ratings of Matsushita Electric
Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer. It was
one of just two Japanese companies which had held a triple-A rating from the
US credit rating agency.
Matsushita's rating, as well as that of three of its subsidiaries, was
downgraded to Aa2 from Aaa. The subsidiaries are MCA Funding, Panasonic
Capital and Panasonic Finance.
Moody's also downgraded the long-term debt rating of MCA, the US
entertainment group owned by Matsushita but not financially supported by it,
to A2 from A1.
The revised ratings reflect Moody's concern about weakening fundamentals in
Matsushita's core consumer electronics business. Sluggish retail demand in
Japan is expected to continue to put pressure on this business, while the
depressed capital expenditure is likely to hit the group's information,
communication and industrial equipment businesses, Moody's said.
Japan's consumer electronics market has been further depressed by a lack of
new products.
In November, Matsushita reported a 66 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for
the first half of the year to March 1993.

ALCAN Aluminium, the Canadian aluminium producer, has fallen deeper into the
red with net losses of USDollars 20m, or 11 cents a share, for the first
quarter of 1993, compared with losses of Dollars 15m, or 9 cents, a year
earlier.
The group's first-quarter sales fell by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.73bn, due to
depressed fabricated metal prices.
The recession in Japan affected Alcan's results. Its share of
equity-accounted companies, including Nippon Light Metal, the Japanese
associate, resulted in a Dollars 2m loss, against a Dollars 22m profit.
In Canada, where Alcan produces most of its ingot, the group's losses were
substantially lower. US operations, which include primary, fabricated and
rolled products, showed a small loss against a slight profit, but Brazil
improved.
The European units weakened, especially in Italy and France, because of the
recession.
Shipments of fabricated products were down 3 per cent and average realised
prices slipped 12 per cent. Ingot shipments were lower, but average prices
received gained a little.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said aluminium was likely to remain over-supplied
in the near term, with depressed prices. Cost reduction and productivity
gains remained the top priority.

THREE investment holding companies in South Africa's Anglo American group -

FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, has paid
Dollars 15m to acquire the Hong Kong-based bank Midlantic (Asia).
This follows the FNB's recent purchase of Henry Ansbacher Holdings, the UK
merchant bank, and its move to set up a branch in Zurich.
Mr Barry Swart, FNB managing director, commenting on the Midlantic
acquisition, said: 'With increasing trading opportunities between South
Africa and Asia, this acquisition forms a key component of FNB's
internationalisation strategy.'
The primary focus of Midlantic's Asian activities is trade finance. It has
an asset base of Dollars 75m, is profitable, and has customers in Hong
Kong's main manufacturing and trading industries.
FNB says Midlantic's activities will shift more towards South African trade
finance than in the past.
The deal, which takes immediate effect, was paid for through the financial
rand.
The name and corporated identity of the Hong Kong bank - previously owned by
Midlantic National Bank of Edison, New Jersey - will be changed to reflect
the new parentage.

financial relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL senior holding companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family
have announced a restructuring of their financial arrangements with one
another.
The changes, the start of an effort to simplify their web of interlocking
private and public companies, will relieve Edper Enterprises and Hees
International Bancorp of contingent obligations relating to Brascan
Holdings.
Brascan is a private company which holds 49 per cent of Brascan Ltd, a
publicly-listed Bronfman holding company.
The changes are complex, reflecting the intricate cross-holdings and
financing arrangements within the Bronfman empire.
As a first step, Edper will contribute CDollars 279m (USDollars 221.40m) of
junior preferred shares to Brascan Holdings. Edper will also have the right
over five years to require Hees to buy its common share holdings in Brascan
for Hees common shares or an equivalent security.
Hees, which owns CDollars 765m of Brascan senior preferred shares, will be
released from an obligation to buy Brascan preferred shares to fund future
purchases of Brascan equity securities.
Hees will also be assured of a more stable earnings and dividend flow from
its investment in Brascan.
The complex structure of the Bronfman empire has made it difficult for
outsiders to judge the extent of recent financial pressures on the group.
This year it has disposed of some of its most prized assets, including
controlling stakes in John Labatt, the brewer and entertainment group, and
MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry company.
As a result of the latest changes, Edper has reduced the carrying value of
its 50.1 per cent stake in Brascan. The CDollars 140m charge pushed Edper to
a CDollars 298.6m loss in 1992, compared with net earnings of CDollars 19.4m
the previous year.
On completion of the transaction, expected in early May, Hees will record a
corresponding gain.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Record quarter at Charles Schwab
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES Schwab, the biggest discount brokerage firm in the US, yesterday
announced record first-quarter profits of Dollars 35.4m, up from Dollars
29.7m a year earlier.
The company continues to benefit from a trend in which individual investors
have moved money out of low-yielding assets and into the stock markets.
Net revenues rose 7 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 236.3m, the highest
in the firm's history. Revenues from brokerage commissions climbed 5 per
cent to Dollars 143.5m, and earnings from mutual fund service fees jumped 54
per cent to Dollars 20.6m as customer assets in the company's funds more
than doubled to Dollars 15.3bn.
The total amount of assets in client accounts at Schwab soared 43 per cent
to Dollars 73bn, with a record 183,000 new accounts opened during the
three-month period.
The company's total expenses rose 5 per cent to Dollars 174.9m in line with
the increase in customer activity.
Despite the record figures, shares in Schwab fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars
35 1/8 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange as investors took profits
in a wide range of brokerage stocks, which had risen sharply earlier in the
week.
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, is opening an office in
Shanghai, the financial capital of China, where it will advise local
companies and investors in financings. Bear Stearns is the second US
securities firm to open a Shanghai office.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), South Korea's largest steel company, may
become subject to anti-trust restrictions, a government official said
yesterday.
Posco is exempt from the anti-trust rules because it is state-run. The
government recently introduced regulations limiting cross-holdings among
subsidiaries belonging to chaebol, the country's 30 biggest business groups.
It also imposed a ceiling on mutual loan guarantees among chaebol
subsidiaries as part of its policy to limit the expansion of the business
groups and reduce their dominance in the nation's economy.
Mr Han Lee-huan, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, said there was
little reason to exempt Posco from these restrictions since it was the fifth
or sixth-largest Korean company in terms of assets, with 20 subsidiaries.
Posco, which enjoyed strong backing from previous governments, has come
under official scrutiny recently after its founder, Mr Park Tae-joon,
opposed the election of the country's new president, Mr Kim Young-sam.
The government recently launched a tax investigation of Posco for possible
illegal use of company funds for political purposes. The tax audit, which
has not been completed, has already forced the resignation of Mr Park and
other senior executives from Posco.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Barrick, the North American gold producer, has again defied the
lacklustre bullion market by doubling first-quarter earnings.
Net income jumped to USDollars 46.1m, or 16 cents a share, from Dollars
23.2m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. The per-share figures have been adjusted
for a two-for-one share split last month.
Revenues rose to Dollars 144.1m from Dollars 81.5m.
The continued surge in profits was due largely to rising production at
Barrick's flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada. Goldstrike produced 307,800
ounces in the latest period, up from 151,800 ounces a year earlier. The
company ascribed the advance to higher-grade sulphide ores.
The higher output and improved grade pushed down operating costs to Dollars
174 an ounce from Dollars 199 an ounce.
Barrick also continues to benefit from its active hedging programme. It
realised an average gold price of Dollars 410 in the first quarter, slightly
below the previous year but still above the average Comex price of Dollars
330 an ounce.
The company said it was on track to meet its 1993 production target of 1.5m
ounces. Its five mines produced a total of 354,800 ounces in the quarter.

UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, yesterday posted a 9.8 per cent
improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 199.2m from
Dollars 181.5m a year earlier. Operating revenues rose 7.2 per cent to
Dollars 932.7m from Dollars 875.8m.
Net income, including the cumulative effect of accounting changes and other
special items, was Dollars 144.6m, or 81 cents a primary share, against a
net deficit of Dollars 85.3m, or 50 cents, a year ago.
Operating income rose to Dollars 184.1m from Dollars 177.6m, with a strong
performance from agricultural operations offsetting a slight decline in
health care.
Mr Ley Smith, chief operating officer said: 'We await the resolution of the
debate over the reform of the US healthcare system, confident that the
strength of our product pipeline and the flexibility of our organisation
will result in a respectable ongoing performance.'
On Wednesday, the company said Mr Smith had assumed the responsibilities of
chief executive because of the deteriorating health of Mr Theodore Cooper,
Upjohn's chairman and chief executive.
Upjohn's R&amp;D expenditure was steady at 16 per cent of sales, but the company
trimmed marketing and administrative costs to 36 per cent from 37 per cent
of sales.
Healthcare sales were flat in the US and up 1 per cent worldwide, with
growth led by antibiotics.
However, several of Upjohn's traditional money-spinners had slower sales in
the quarter.

services - FASB rule may not be as damaging as opponents claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY has there been an accountancy rule as controversial in the US
financial services industry as the decision this week by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board to force the nation's banks, insurers and other
financial institutions to value more of their bond holdings at current
market prices.
The ruling, which takes effect with 1994 financial statements, triggered an
outcry from banking and insurance industry executives, who claimed the rule
would create volatility in earnings, policyholder surpluses and equity
accounts.
The bankers' argument is that by forcing them to revalue their bond holdings
each quarter, their financial results will become more confusing. Insurers
maintain the new rule could force them to shorten the maturities of the
Treasury bonds they hold.
But a closer examination of the rule shows it may not pose as much of a
threat as its opponents claim.
Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has
had nothing but praise for the new rule. He said it would clarify 'the rules
of the road' and lessen the number of enforcement actions needed by the SEC.
Mr Edward Markey, the Democratic member of Congress from Massachusetts who
chairs the House Finance Committee, argued that had the mark-to-market rule
been in effect a decade ago it might have helped prevent some of the savings
and loan scandals of the 1980s by giving investors a more accurate picture
of bank values.
Banks have reason, at least at the political level, to be nervous about a
rule that affects their Treasury bond holdings.
Since 1990, US banks have increased their holdings of Treasury paper
substantially. Three years ago, such paper represented an average of 10 per
cent of US bank assets; by the middle of last year, the proportion had
jumped to 17 per cent, meaning that US banks held Dollars 281bn of Treasury
paper.
Politicians have blamed bankers for causing the credit crunch by reducing
business lending while building up Treasury holdings.
In fairness to the banks, the trend was exacerbated by new capital ratio
guidelines that acted as a disincentive to lenders, who were already wary
because of the commercial property loan crisis that faced US banks between
1990 and 1992.
Mr Tom Jones, senior Citicorp executive in charge of finance, said he could
see no real impact on bank earnings. But he added that one result of the new
rule might be to cause banks to reduce their overall bond holdings to avoid
having to reclassify the values every three months. 'In a pragmatic sense I
can't see why we should bother holding long-term securities at all,' said Mr
Jones.
Another aspect of the rule - causing banks to classify bonds as available
for sale rather than as long-term investments - could force some to move
from longer to shorter term bond maturities.
Ms Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, the bond
market analysts, noted that 'many banks have already been preparing for the
eventuality of having to mark to market by moving to shorter term
maturities. So there should not be an inordinate volatility as a result of
this rule.'
Mr James McDermott, president of Keefe Bruyette, the bank analysts, said
most analysts 'consider this a bogus issue because we already take into
account the real market value of such holdings.'
Insurers' hostility towards greater current cost accounting of their
investment portfolios is just as deep-rooted. Repeatedly, the insurance
community has argued it was misleading - even dangerous - to value assets at
market levels, but not liabilities.
Furthermore, it has protested that a considerable portion of insurers'
investment portfolios were not readily marketable. 'Current' valuations,
therefore, will be subjective.
However, the narrower FASB ruling has prompted critics of the move to
highlight two specific practical implications.
The first is that the new FASB rule will add even more volatility to
insurers' earnings. If there were to be a period of high inflation, and a
sharp jump in interest rates, for example, it might even create 'technical'
insolvencies, requiring regulators to intervene and take over these
temporarily 'ailing' companies.
Second, some in the industry think that insurers will be increasingly
anxious to invest in shorter-term securities to minimise their exposure to
interest-rate-related volatility and improve liquidity.
The numbers involved are not small: life companies alone have assets of
about Dollars 1,700bn. About 60 per cent of this - about Dollars 1,000bn -
is currently invested in bonds, and perhaps three-quarters of that amount in
longer-term bonds.
The counter-argument is that marking more of the bond portfolios to market
will prove a valuable discipline, and the industry's reaction is
unnecessarily alarmist.
'I think the response from the industry is way overdone,' comments Mr Ernest
Jacobs, insurance analyst at Furman Selz. 'Some companies have effectively
already adopted this treatment - and, frankly, I'd be hard-pressed to say
that they've been scarred as a result.'
Arguments can clearly be made from both sides of the issue. What seems clear
is that insurers have more at stake in overall money terms than do banks.
But few people, opponents of the rule included, would be so bold as to claim
mark-to-market is likely to trigger a financial nightmare. The main impact
looks like creating still more bureaucracy for accountants.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Texas Instruments doubles net
income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
yesterday reported a more than doubling of first-quarter net income, due to
strong growth in its semiconductor business.
The company reported net income of Dollars 85m, or 89 cents a share, before
accounting changes, compared with Dollars 40m, or 35 cents, in the same
period of last year. Revenues totalled Dollars 1.88bn, up from Dollars
1.69bn.
Profits from operations totalled Dollars 140m, compared with Dollars 63m.
The company said this rise was 'driven by faster-than-market revenue growth
in application-specific products' in the semiconductor business.
The company's defence electronics business had maintained stable margins at
levels that met TI's goals for return on assets, the company added. Its
information technology business operated at a small loss for the quarter.
Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman, said the company expected 25 per cent growth in
US semiconductor demand, 28 per cent growth in Asian-Pacific, and 13 per
cent growth in Europe.
The world semiconductor market could reach at least Dollars 70bn in 1993, up
17 per cent from 1992, and 'it could go higher based on the current strength
of orders in the US'.
In view of this, the company planned capital spending of Dollars 650m in
1993, about Dollars 220m more than in 1992, with the emphasis on equipment
to support the manufacture of differentiated products.
Mr Junkins said a key element of the company's semiconductor strategy was to
increase the percentage of differentiated products in the portfolio, which
would make its product mix better aligned with growth markets.
In the first quarter, the company's results included royalty revenues of
Dollars 94m, including one-time royalties of Dollars 22m from previously
announced agreements with personal computer manufacturers.

GILLETTE, the shaving and consumer products group, yesterday announced that
after-tax profits rose to Dollars 142.3m in the first quarter of 1993 before
accounting-related changes. This compared with Dollars 129.4m last year.
After a Dollars 138.6m charge, mainly stemming from the new accounting
treatment of post-retirement benefits, net profits in the first quarter of
1993 fell to Dollars 3.7m. Earnings per share, ahead of accounting changes,
increased by 10.3 per cent, at 64 cents. Gillette also announced a 16.7 per
cent increase in the company's dividend.
Gillette's first-quarter sales showed little change year-on-year at Dollars
1.22bn. Operating profits were up by Dollars 262.4m, a 6 per cent rise.
The company said the first quarter reflected strong blade and razor sales in
the US and in Latin America, but continued weakness in Europe and expenses
related to the launch of its new Gillette Series male toiletries line.

FORTIS, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, yesterday tried to
dampen speculation about a likely reshuffle of its banking assets in
Belgium.
The group, which announced a 4.4 per cent increase in net profits last year,
to Ecu419m (Dollars 513m) from Ecu402m, wants to sell part of its 14.7 per
cent holding in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank.
But Mr Maurice Lippens, joint chairman, said yesterday that Fortis would
take its time and did not want to 'destabilise' Generale de Banque. 'We
believe the price (of the bank shares) today is a good price, but it still
could be a little higher,' he said.
Fortis - which groups together the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of
the Netherlands - decided to reduce its stake in the bank after failing to
agree terms on which it could sell its insurance products through Generale
de Banque's branch network.
Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company and a
prominent shareholder in both AG and Generale de Banque, has expressed an
interest in buying the shares.
Fortis is now considering whether to bid for a stake in CGER-ASLK, a Belgian
state-owned savings bank, which is part of the government's privatisation
programme.
Mr Lippens said Fortis was not selling the Generale de Banque stake to raise
funds for a stake in CGER-ASLK, which he described as 'an outstanding
example of 'bancassurance' in Belgium'.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: KIO launches writs in UK in
effort to recover Dollars 500m
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti
government, yesterday launched writs in the UK seeking recovery of more than
Dollars 500m. The KIO alleges this sum was misappropriated from Grupo
Torras, its Spanish business which is in receivership, and a London
offshoot, Torras Hostench London.
It named 22 defendants in the proceedings, including some of the former
managers of Grupo Torras and Torras Hostench London.
The actions are civil claims, based upon conspiracy to defraud, breach of
directors' duties and breaches of trust.
The writs come after the failure of the new management of the KIO to
convince courts in Spain that their complaints warranted investigation and
criminal proceedings. Both efforts were dismissed earlier this year in
Madrid for lack of evidence of criminal acts.
The writs issued in London yesterday draw in many more defendants than the
Spanish proceedings.
The new KIO management has claimed that all Dollars 5bn invested by Kuwait
in its Spanish industrial empire since 1986 has been lost due to gross
mismanagement by former KIO executives and Spanish managers.
The writs name Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the former KIO chairman and a cousin
of the emir of Kuwait, Mr Richard Robinson, a former head of the KIO's
direct investments department, who left KIO in 1989, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the
former KIO managing director, Mr Walid Makezou, a director of Torras
Hostench London, and Mr Plinio Coll Gutierrez, Grupo Torras' former internal
auditor.
In addition, they name Mr Javier de la Rosa, the financier who managed the
KIO's Spanish investments until May last year, and a number of his
associates, Mr Miguel Soler Sala, former finance director of Grupo Torras,
Mr Jorge Nunez, former managing director of Grupo Torras, Mr Narciso de Mir,
a director of Quail Espana, Mr De la Rosa's investment company, which had a
management contract with Torras, and Mr Juan Jose Folchi and Mr Joan Pique,
two lawyers close to Mr De la Rosa.
The writs also name Mr Michael Russell, a Jersey lawyer, and his firm
Russell Limebeer, in addition to eight offshore companies apparently
established in Jersey by the KIO and used in the financing of its Spanish
investments. The companies named are Croesus International, Wardbase,
Oakthorn, Westow, Anslow, Wantley Development, Coggia and Riquel.
If the writs are successful and lead to a trial in the UK, vast amounts of
information on the once highly-secret management of Kuwait's oil fortunes is
likely to be made public.

Dumez

<TEXT>
LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French industrial and utility group which this
week announced a sharp fall in last year's profits, plans to invest FFr500m
(Dollars 93m) in Dumez, its troubled construction subsidiary, through a
capital increase.
The recapitalisation, which has been triggered by the need to repair Dumez'
balance sheet after its heavy losses last year, is expected to take place
within the next few weeks.
Lyonnaise said yesterday that the transaction would raise Dumez'
shareholders' funds to between FFr1bn and FFr1.5bn.
Dumez, one of France's largest construction companies, was taken over three
years ago by Lyonnaise, which has extensive interests in water distribution
and property.
The European construction industry has since suffered severely in the
economic slowdown. Lyonnaise' construction interests, of which Dumez forms
the largest part, almost doubled its losses from FFr276m in 1991 to FFr461m
on static sales of FFr45.9bn in 1992.

<TEXT>
ILVA, the Italian steel group controlled by the IRI state holding company,
yesterday outlined long-awaited restructuring plans to lower its debts and
restore earnings.
The news came as Ilva announced a L2,309bn (Dollars 1.46bn) loss for 1992 on
sales of L10,087bn, down from L10,923bn the previous year. In 1991, the
group lost L504bn after minority interests and after setting aside L411bn in
extraordinary gains in a restructuring fund. Net debts rose to L7,583bn last
year.
Although financial details of the restructuring were not revealed, it is
clear the proposals, to be submitted to the European Commission by the end
of this month, could prompt a clash with officials and big European
steelmakers.
Ilva crossed swords with the Commission over two capital increases,
amounting to L650bn, authorised by IRI. The opening of a formal procedure by
the Commission has been postponed pending details of the restructuring.
The plan envisages the creation of a company specialising in flat laminates.
Although IRI will be sole shareholder, it will aim gradually to lower its
stake below 50 per cent. Other Ilva operations, not deemed to be strategic
but which cannot be sold immediately, will be handled directly by IRI.

collapse

<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed under the weight of its debt in
February, yesterday said it had been pushed into receivership by a
'minority' of unnamed bankers who demanded up to 10 weeks to study the
company's last-ditch restructuring plan drawn up in January.
Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the 'old' Daf as well as of the successor company
which was formed last month, also said it was 'particularly unfortunate'
that the company's bankers had demanded that Daf's attempt to form a
strategic partnership with Mercedes-Benz of Germany in 1992 should include a
form of equity participation.
Mr Baan, who was speaking at the company's extraordinary shareholders'
meeting, said: 'This limited the freedom to develop alternative scenarios.'
The meeting, which lasted nearly six hours, was dominated by Mr Baan's
explanation of the company's fortunes since its merger with Leyland, the UK
commercial vehicle maker, in 1987.
It was also marked by angry recriminations from shareholders who have been
told that they will received nothing for their shares, as well as by
criticism from Daf employees who lost their jobs when the company was
revived in slimmed-down form in March.
The new company, Daf Trucks, includes the core of the old company's
operations in the Netherlands and Belgium but excludes the UK operations,
Leyland Daf.
Daf released figures for 1992 showing that its net loss narrowed to Fl 257m
(Dollars 143m) from Fl 395m in 1991, taking cumulative losses since 1990 to
Fl 880m.
Mr Baan said the figures demonstrated that Daf was making progress in
cutting costs when it ran into difficulties. Operating results swung into a
profit of Fl 22m from a loss of Fl 98m the year before.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group,
said net profit rose by 6.5 per cent to Fl 1.68bn (Dollars 933m) in 1992, as
a strong increase in banking profits more than compensated for a slight
decline in insurance results, writes Ronald van de Krol.
In banking, ING saw an 11.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Fl 1.05bn
and a strong increase in international lending, which was up more than 25
per cent over 1991.
ING's insurance operations faced depressed results in non-life and
reinsurance activities, though life insurance developed favourably. Overall,
pre-tax profits from insurance dropped by 1 per cent to Fl 1.14bn. In early
1993, the company said it was withdrawing from general reinsurance of large
risks such as ships, aircraft and natural disasters.
The 1992 dividend is to be raised 3.6 per cent to Fl 3.20 per share, with a
choice offered between payment in cash or preference shares.

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Bid talk boosts Petrofina shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Petrofina, the Belgian oil and gas company, rose 6 per cent
yesterday morning in heavy trading on the Brussels bourse, amid speculation
about a possible takeover bid for the group.
After reaching a peak of BFr9,750 at 2pm, the shares slipped back to close
at BFr9,400, an increase of 2 per cent on the opening price of BFr9,200.
The group's share price has risen nearly 25 per since Petrofina announced
poor 1992 results in February, and traders have speculated that
Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company, may be a suitor for
the company.
Elf said yesterday that it owned a small stake in Petrofina - less than the
5 per cent threshold for declaration - but said it had not bought stock in
yesterday's heavy trading, which saw turnover reach nearly 74,000 shares.
The group said it held the shares as a financial rather than an industrial
investment, and as a means of maintaining a presence in the north European
market.
Petrofina is in the process of strengthening its defences against a
takeover. However, the company says this is not a reaction to recent
speculation, but the implementation of plans mapped out after Belgium
reformed its stock exchange rules two years ago.
The group hopes to improve the transparency of its share register by making
it obligatory for investors to declare stakes of over 3 per cent. It also
wants to be able to buy in its own shares without obtaining shareholder
permission in advance. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at an
extraordinary meeting on April 27.
The share price of Petrofina, one of Belgium's largest quoted companies,
suffered last year after doubts were raised about the group's investment in
the Ekofisk oil field, and investors realised that the group's main
divisions - refining and marketing, and petrochemicals - were both
experiencing a downturn. The stock fell from a high of BFr11,750 in May to
BFr7,010 in mid-October.
In practice, however, it would be impossible to bid for the company without
the support of Belgium's two largest holding companies, Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert, which controls some 28 per cent, and Societe Generale de Belgique
which owns a further 11 per cent.
Consolidated profit at Petrofina dropped by 72 per cent last year, to
BFr4.6bn (Dollars 195m).

FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Lanvin chairman replaced after
concern over costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Pietrini has been ousted as chairman of Lanvin, the French luxury
goods group, just six months after the multi-million dollar relaunch of the
company.
He has been replaced by Mr Lois Armand, 41, a senior executive at L'Oreal,
the French cosmetics company. L'Oreal three years ago bought Lanvin for over
FFr400m (Dollars 74.38m at current exchange rates) in a joint venture with
Orcofi, the investment consortium founded by Mr Henry Recamier, former head
of the Louis Vuitton luggage business following his defeat in the battle for
control of the LVMH group.
L'Oreal and Orcofi are believed to have become concerned both about the cost
of the relaunch and Lanvin's mounting losses. The luxury goods market has
suffered severely in the world recession. Lanvin is believed to have lost
FFr120m in each of 1991 and 1992.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Radamec recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Radamec Group, which is engaged in electronics and precision mechanical
engineering, continued its recovery in the year to December 31 1992, and
increased its pre-tax profit from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 832,000.
It also reduced gearing from 39 per cent to 20 per cent and, at the
year-end, had turned an overdraft of Pounds 456,000 into cash of Pounds
460,000.
The profit was achieved on a turnover ahead only 16 per cent to Pounds 11.9m
(Pounds 10.3m) and took account of reorganisation costs of Pounds 111,000.
Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 244,000.
Earnings per share surged to 4.6p (1.9p) and the dividend for the year is
lifted from 0.5p to 1.5p with a proposed final of 1p.

red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of its final withdrawal from US coal production put Alexander
Russell, the Scottish quarrying, concrete and coal group, into a Pounds
1.93m pre-tax loss in 1992, against a Pounds 1.66m profit previously.
A one-off charge of Pounds 2.56m related to closure of the coal operation in
Southern Illinois and any foreseeable costs linked to the withdrawal.
The final dividend was passed, restricting the total to 1p (2.15p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 802,000
(Pounds 1.49m) from discontinued operations.
Losses per share were 11.86p basic (2.59p earnings) and 8.26p (3.32p
earnings) diluted.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Risky contract helps Cradley reach Pounds
1.14m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim pre-tax profits of Cradley Group, the lithographic printer, surged
from Pounds 487,000 to Pounds 1.14m, but the result benefited from a large
one-off contract in a 'disappointing half year'.
Mr Donald Jordan, chairman, said the period to December 31 saw a shrinking
market for print, with profit margins virtually zero.
He said the one-off contract for Europe resulted in a considerable
over-recovery of costs. In terms of production schedule it was a high risk
contract, but the very tight schedule had been met.
The magazine printing business, he said, returned a loss of some Pounds
400,000 after tax.
Sales increased to Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 13.7m). Earnings per share were 2.3p
(1p).

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: A scheme designed for better times - Queens
Moat's difficulties relate in part to its incentives plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS Moat Houses' share suspension shocked the City last month as details
emerged of the company's financial difficulties, which were partly caused by
a controversial incentive scheme. But according to some managers within the
scheme, problems were apparent nine months ago.
Several managers said their annual renegotiations of incentive fees suddenly
became tense from last summer. The company started pushing for higher fees
even though hotel revenues were falling. In some cases, Queens Moat tried to
impose shorter contracts which would have squeezed hotel profitability
during the quieter winter months.
One manager, who said he was treated 'bloody well' during his 10 years with
the company, was shocked when Queens Moat turned nasty after negotiations on
fees broke down.
'They knew I was away, but they phoned my wife at home late on Sunday to say
the hotel was coming out of the incentive scheme the next morning. It was
not nice, especially since they were usually quite friendly,' he said.
In retrospect, managers like these were shocked but not surprised when
Queens Moat's shares were suspended last month as it emerged that the
company was expected to announce a loss instead of a profit for the year to
December 31.
According to one manager, the incentive schemes were 'fair but unscientific.
No-one really knew the true story of the profits so everything was done on
trust. Queens Moat couldn't have known what was going on in many cases'.
The incentive scheme, which is now being partly blamed for Queens Moat's
financial troubles, had been running for nearly 20 years and is remarkably
simple. At its peak, the scheme covered 65 of the company's 103 British
hotels, although about half have since come out of the scheme and returned
to direct management.
Each manager agrees in advance their incentive fee, often equal to about a
quarter of annual turnover, and signs a promissory note guaranteeing to pay
Queens Moat. The fee is paid in 13 four-weekly instalments. At the end of
the year, the manager keeps any money outstanding as profit or makes up any
shortfall.
The scheme was designed to give managers greater autonomy to improve their
profits, as well as reduce central management overheads.
But the lax financial controls upon which the scheme thrived were to prove
its downfall as recession mounted. Queens Moat appears to have persuaded its
auditors, Bird Luckin, that promissory notes from managers allowed the
company to book profits early. For example, if the company signed an
incentive contract for Pounds 1m in November, the full benefit of that
guaranteed payment was taken in that year's accounts.
'They appear to have been using next year's profits to meet this year's
forecasts,' according to one manager. In order for growth to be maintained,
the company needed to keep increasing incentive fees, or bring in more
incentive managers.
But as the effects of recession escalated following the Gulf War, more and
more managers found they could not meet Queens Moat's fees. 'I just knew I
could not achieve the levels they were asking,' said another manager, who
came out of the scheme last year.
By some estimates, Queens Moat may have to make provisions of up to Pounds
20m to cover incentive fees which have been booked as profits but not been
paid. One manager, who has since left the company, said he knew of six other
managers who owed Queens Moat fees from two years ago yet are continuing to
manage the company's hotels.
Since Queens Moat's suspension, a veil of silence has fallen over the
company pending a report from accountants Grant Thornton, expected next
month. Mr John Bairstow, the company's founder and chairman, has agreed to a
request from Queens Moat's banks not to talk publicly about the situation.
A meeting was held last week for the company's hotel managers at the Elstree
Moat House. It was led by Mr Gerald Bell, group operations director, who
told managers to deny that any meeting took place if asked. Of about 15
managers spoken to by the Financial Times, none was prepared to be
identified.
Despite uncertainty about Queens Moat's financial position, most managers
report that trading and morale have not suffered unduly. A few managers
cancelled holidays because of the crisis, some said suppliers had called to
check all was well and staff have been reassured about the viability of
individual hotels.
Even managers who have since left retain a sense of loyalty to the company
and to Mr Bairstow. 'I made more money and ran a better hotel because of
those incentives. They should have realised things were wrong earlier, but
they were super people to work with,' one former manager said.
'Quite a few hotels are still trading well,' another manager said. 'We had a
successful Easter and May is looking busy. It was Queens Moat's borrowings
and financial side which went wrong, not the hotels,' he said.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Meggitt rise to Pounds
23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEGGITT, the Dorset based engineering company, yesterday reported a 4 per
cent increase in operating profits, helped by acquisitions, but a fall in
earnings per share.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 25.3m, including losses
of Pounds 493,000 from discontinued operations. Sales improved by 8.5 per
cent, from Pounds 302m to Pounds 328m.
At the pre-tax level, profits rose from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 23m, helped
by a Pounds 3.5m swing from an interest charge to a receipt of Pounds
929,000 from the proceeds of the 1991 rights issue. This was struck after
taking a higher loss on disposal of discontinued operations.
Earnings per share fell from 6.9p to 6.6p, based on the new FRS 3 accounting
standards. Stripping out the loss on discontinued businesses, earnings fell
from 8.4p to 8.1p.
The board is proposing a 2.53p final dividend, giving a total of 3.78p, a 5
per cent increase for the year.
Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said he was very confident about the
future and that the company had had a good first quarter. 'We have had, and
still have, a difficult environment but we have performed better than our
peers,' he said.
In aerospace, margins remained about the same and profits would have been
almost unchanged before acquisitions.
The electronics and controls divisions reported profits broadly maintained.
Profits from the energy division halved to Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds
45m.
The group finished the year with gearing of 14 per cent.
COMMENT
Meggitt has been viewed warily by the market because of its failed 1990 bid
for USH, its sometimes opaque acquisition policy and the 1991 rights issue.
With Tweedie focusing on the provisioning habits of acquisitive companies,
the market might be expected to remain cautious. But Meggitt now looks set
for a period of consolidating what it has acquired and is already showing
quite considerable cash generating powers. The oil business, hit by a lower
oil price, and aerospace, which will be affected in the second half by cuts
at Boeing, might restrict any advances from here. But there seems little
downside at current levels. The company is forecast to make profits of at
least Pounds 30m this year on a normalised basis, helped by currency and the
inclusion of a full year's contribution from Endevco. This gives earnings of
8.8p and a prospective multiple of an undemanding 12.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alex Russell Pounds 2m in red after US
withdrawal costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of its final withdrawal from US coal production put Alexander
Russell, the Scottish quarrying, concrete and coal group, into a Pounds
1.93m pre-tax loss in 1992, against a Pounds 1.66m profit previously.
A one-off charge of Pounds 2.56m related to closure of the coal operation in
Southern Illinois and any foreseeable costs linked to the withdrawal.
The final dividend was passed, restricting the total to 1p (2.15p). The
board hopes to return to normal dividends this year.
Trading profit was reduced from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 625,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 802,000
(Pounds 1.49m) from discontinued operations.
'It is the second loss in our history, which, as with the first in 1925,
arose through terrible coal trading conditions,' Mr Russell Nicolson,
chairman, said.
The quarrying side recorded a 41 per cent decline in profit to Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 2.7m), and in concrete, profits fell to Pounds 513,000 (Pounds
805,000) . However UK coal operations showed a substantial increase to
Pounds 548,000.
There were signs of recovery in the company's markets.
'With the closure of our loss-making US coal operations, an overall
reduction of Pounds 500,000 in labour costs through early retirement and 50
redundancies, and the effects of reduced interest rates, we are confident of
a return to profit this year.'
Losses per share were 11.86p basic (2.59p earnings) and 8.26p (3.32p
earnings) fully diluted.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Old masters sales boost Parambe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Parambe, which deals in investments and works of art, lifted its pre-tax
profit from Pounds 66,000 to Pounds 114,000 in 1992. The growth in asset
value - the company's principal objective - was 6.3 per cent to 60.8p per
share.
Dealing income from works of art doubled to Pounds 170,000 in a sluggish
market. That was largely the result of sales of old master drawings to a US
museum, which was unlikely to be repeated in 1993.
However, there were further write-downs of investments in art dealers and a
sharp reduction in investment income from that source.
Earnings per share rose to 1.27p (0.79p) and the dividend is again 1.1p with
a final of 0.55p.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Brooks Service falls Pounds 392,000 into
loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES CONTINUED into the second half at Brooks Service Group, and for the
full 1992 year the pre-tax figure was Pounds 392,000, against profits of
Pounds 587,000. As forecast, there is no dividend.
Last year the group, which provides textile care and rental services, paid a
total of 4.05p from earnings per share of 3.25p. Losses this time came to
1.76p.
Mr Simon Brooks, chairman, said the group faced unprecedented trading
conditions and the upturn in sales usually experienced in the second half
failed to materialise. The year's turnover was Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 23.8m)
but operating profits slumped to Pounds 117,000 (Pounds 1.11m).
He added that there had been tentative signs since the year-end that the
group's markets were improving.
The drop in operating profit was exacerbated by restructuring costs of
Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 151,000) and higher interest charges of Pounds
532,000 (Pounds 490,000).
The figures have been produced under FRS 3. Last year's reported pre-tax
profit was Pounds 645,000.

MR BRIAN Pearse, the chief executive of HSBC's Midland Bank subsidiary, sold
most of his Midland Bank shares last year for an estimated Pounds 1.3m,
rather than accept the offer of new HSBC securities, it emerged yesterday,
writes Robert Peston.
Midland was acquired last year by HSBC. The annual report of HSBC, which
also owns Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Marine Midland in the US, discloses
that in August 1992, Mr Pearse exercised options granted in 1991 to acquire
300,000 Midland Bank ordinary shares.
Of these, he sold 290,000 shares and transferred the balance to a member of
his family, who accepted the HSBC takeover offer.
The annual report also discloses that Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman,
was paid HKDollars 10.6m (Pounds 883,000) last year, up 14 per cent on the
previous year.

Tudor, the USM-quoted homewares company, made a small profit in the second
half of 1992 cutting the year's loss to Pounds 104,000 after exceptional
charges of Pounds 74,000. In the previous year there was a profit of Pounds

In view of the prospects a single dividend of 0.25p is being paid, against
an interim of 0.5p in 1991. Cost of the payment is virtually unchanged
following the acquisition of MGB Tiles which represented 48 per cent of the
enlarged capital. Losses per share were 1.16p (earnings 0.72p).

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ashley to sell Spanish food arm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashley Group is selling Digsa, the Spanish food retailing operation, to
Parafax, for a deferred cash consideration of Pounds 20m and the assumption
of net debt of Pounds 33m.
Parafax is a Hong Kong company formed for the purpose of acquiring retail
companies by a consortium of investors, among whom are Sir Ralph Halpern and
Sir Michael Sandberg.
Ashley does not expect to pay a final dividend. It said the level of
activity across the group's non-food businesses remained encouraging.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: BP chief defends predecessor's pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Ashburton, chairman of BP, has defended the Pounds 1.5m package of
compensation and pension payments made to Mr Robert Horton, his predecessor
who was ousted in a boardroom coup last summer.
He told the annual meeting that 'the figures are in absolute terms large,
and perhaps larger than are easily understood'. But, he said, the Pounds
780,000 paid in compensation was what Mr Horton could have expected to
receive in court proceedings if the company had not agreed to pay.
Some Pounds 723,000 was also made to the pension fund to ensure his pension
rights were fully funded.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Blue Circle Industries slips 4.9% to Pounds
93.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE Industries, the cement, central heating and bathroom products
group, yesterday reported a 4.9 per cent decline in full year pre-tax profit
and a sharp drop in earnings because of higher tax charges.
Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director, said the results showed
BCI's 'resilience during adverse trading conditions,' but added 'we as a
board are not satisfied with them.'
Pre-tax profits at the group, which has adopted the new FRS 3 accounting
standard, fell from a restated Pounds 98.6m to Pounds 93.8m on turnover
which grew by 19.2 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn (Pounds 1.15bn). The 1991
pre-tax figure was previously reported as Pounds 124.2m.
After a substantially higher tax charge of Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 35.9m)
earnings fell to 4p (8.6p). Nevertheless, as promised at the time of the
group's Pounds 241.6m rights issue last year, the final dividend is being
maintaining at 7.5p, giving an unchanged total of 11.25p.
Operating profits, before exceptional costs of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 42.1m)
and net interest of Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 22.8m), fell to Pounds 131.4m
(Pounds 163.5m).
Profits from the group's cement, concrete and aggregates businesses slipped
by 8 per cent to Pounds 98.1m (Pounds 106.5m) on turnover of Pounds 611.2m
(Pounds 619.8m). Although the recession in the UK hit demand and profits and
the group's South African operations were sold in March, other overseas
operations, particularly those in the US and Chile, increased their profit
contributions significantly.
Operating profits from the fast growing home products division which had a
turnover of Pounds 657.8m (Pounds 422.2m) increased to Pounds 60.2m (Pounds
51.1m) including a Pounds 12.2m second-half contribution from the recently
acquired Celsius French and German central heating businesses.
The property division made an operating loss of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 11.6m
profits) largely as a result of a write-down of its 50 per cent investment
in the Chafford Hundred new town project in Essex.
The Pounds 11.8m exceptional charge comprised Pounds 62.1m in reorganisation
costs in the UK cement business and a Pounds 9.4m property write-down,
partly offset by Pounds 59.7m in profits and provision release from the sale
of businesses in South Africa and the UK.
The group's net debt was largely unchanged at Pounds 404.5m (Pounds 396.3m),
representing gearing of 40.1 per cent.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: GPA agrees leases for 203 aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, yesterday said that in the 12
months to March 31 it had agreed leases for 203 aircraft, up from 161 the
previous year.
Twenty aircraft had been returned because the lessee had defaulted or the
lease had expired.
Mr Colm Barrington, GPA's commercial director, said there had been fewer
repossessions of aircraft than in the previous year.
Last year, to help lessees in difficulty, GPA rescheduled some lease rentals
for periods of four to 24 months.
For the three months to June 30 1992 - the latest publicly available figures
 -profits from aircraft leasing fell to Dollars 11m, (Pounds 7.2m) against
Dollars 24m.
The group said that 58 new aircraft were purchased for Dollars 1.5bn and at
March 31 it had 483 aircraft in its portfolio.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: German side steadies RMC at Pounds 167m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in profits from Germany almost offset reductions in RMC
Group's other locations to leave pre-tax profits for 1992 at Pounds 166.6m,
barely changed from the previous Pounds 167.4m.
The ready-mixed concrete group has benefited from high levels of house
building, reflecting immigration to western Germany and the improvement in
infrastructure in eastern Germany.
RMC also announced that Mr Jim Owen, group managing director, will become
executive chairman on May 1. Mr John Camden, the current chairman who has
been with the group since 1952, is retiring because of ill health but will
become president. Mr Peter Young, deputy managing director, will step up to
Mr Owen's job.
Mr Owen said the high level of demand for housing in Germany would continue
to support the operations there, although margins of 9.7 per cent were
already high. Possibilities in eastern Germany were 'very exciting indeed'.
Operating profits from Germany rose 36 per cent to Pounds 123.2m, making up
two-thirds of the group total of Pounds 186.9m, down 4 per cent from Pounds
194.6m in 1991. The rise in profits from associates, which includes RMC's
Berlin operation, from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 14.1m, also reflected strong
demand in Germany.
Figures also gained from translation at lower sterling rates. RMC uses
year-end exchange rates, and the effect of the pound's fall was to add 4p to
earnings per share of 31.2p (36p), down 13 per cent. Earnings also suffered
through a rise in minority interests to Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 38.5m), again
reflecting the strength of German profits.
The three other geographical areas suffered falls. In the UK operating
profits fell 71 per cent to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 34.9m) although turnover
was only 5 per cent lower at Pounds 859.6m. In 1989 UK profits were Pounds
132m.
Mr John Cooper, head of the UK concrete operations, said since the market
peak RMC had taken 352 truck mixers off the road, cutting capacity by about
30 per cent.
Operating profits from other EC countries dropped 28 per cent to Pounds
39.7m (Pounds 55.1m). The completion of large projects in Spain had cut
volumes by 14-15 per cent and a further fall was expected in 1993. Demand in
France had weakened too.
Profits from outside the EC fell to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 14.2m).
Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said that gearing at 31 per cent (35 per
cent) was not a problem. Interest charges of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 33.9m)
were covered 5.8 times by operating profits. He said that capital
expenditure had been cut to Pounds 114.2m from Pounds 248m in 1991 and
Pounds 311m in 1990. In 1993 it will be about Pounds 125m. The depreciation
charge was Pounds 131.7m (Pounds 117.5m).
An unchanged final dividend of 13.4p is proposed to give a maintained total
of 20p.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Accounting change at TI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in TI fell 2p to 301p yesterday as the market pondered the change in
the specialist engineer's accounting policies which its annual report
revealed this week.
Analysts said there was also concern about the possible affect on
acquisitive companies from the Accounting Standards Board's proposed changes
to fair value provisioning.
TI said it had capitalised Pounds 7.7m of research and development costs in
its Dowty arm. It said the policy of writing R&amp;D off through the P&amp;L account
remained unchanged elsewhere in the group. Dowty was, however, developing
new landing gear for the Airbus A330 and A340. The capitalised R&amp;D was in
the accounts within work in progress.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to pay SmithKline Beecham for use of
drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO and SmithKline Beecham have settled a patents dispute over Zofran, one
of Glaxo's fastest growing drugs. Glaxo has agreed to pay a royalty to
SmithKline Beecham for the use of Zofran in its treatments for all forms of
nausea and vomiting.
Neither company would give the size of the royalty, but both said it was
likely to be a single percentage figure of sales which were Pounds 163m for
the last six months of 1992.
'This is a very good deal for SmithKline Beecham. The royalties will fall
straight through to the bottom line,' said Mr Jonathan de Pass, analyst at
BZW.
SmithKline Beecham has recently been issued European patents for the use of
a class of drugs called 5HT3-antagonists - of which Zofran is a member - for
the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy.
The agreement is particularly good for SmithKline Beecham because it covers
all types of nausea, including post-operative nausea. Glaxo's patents for
Zofran are not affected.
Meanwhile, Glaxo yesterday sought to play down the significance of a trial
suggesting that two cheap generic drugs in combination were more effective
than Zofran.
The trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggested
patients on the two drugs, metoclopramide and dexamethasone, had
significantly less nausea and vomiting during the first 24 hours than those
on Zofran.
Glaxo said the study was in patients receiving weak chemotherapy and up to
50 per cent of patients would not experience nausea anyway.
Mr James Culverwell, analyst at Hoare Govett, said all customers were
looking at the cost-effectiveness of drugs. The trial suggested the two
drugs might be used in preference to Zofran where weak chemotherapy was
involved. Glaxo's shares closed 8p higher at 562p.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Campari just passes Pounds 1m mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPARI International, the sporting leisure wear group, saw its pre-tax
profits drop to Pounds 1.11m in 1992, compared with Pounds 5.27m in the
previous 13 months.
A final dividend of 8.75p maintains the total at 12p, although earnings per
share slumped from 39.24p to 0.79p.
The group wrote down stock worth Pounds 2m and in future plans to write down
stock by 25 per cent per season. It was hit by the devaluation of sterling.
Analysts said the write down was a response to the trend for retailers to
operate just-in-time-stocking systems as well as the drop in inflation.
One said: 'There was a time when companies could simply carry stock over,
and perhaps even get away with selling it at a higher price the following
year.
'With retailers turning to demand-driven, just-in-time stocking systems and
inflation more stable, that just isn't on any more,' he said.
Mr Kit Maunsell, chief executive at Campari, said: 'We are taking a
different view of the spread at which we sell stock.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 54.2m (Pounds 53.7m). However, 71 per cent of sales
were made overseas, and in terms of local currencies turnover was about 4
per cent below 1991.
The net interest charge dropped to Pounds 205,000 (Pounds 424,000). The
company had Pounds 4m cash, but a Pounds 1m overdraft on a UK subsidiary.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley back with Pounds 1.8m but
passes dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY, the international clothing and home furnishings group,
yesterday reported its first pre-tax profit since 1989, in spite of a
management shake-up which resulted in a large operating loss in its US
division.
The group, which sees itself as a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a retailer,
made a profit of Pounds 1.8m before tax for the year to January 30, compared
with a Pounds 9.1m loss after restructuring costs last time.
Earnings were 0.34p (3.86p losses) but the company once again decided that
it was 'prudent' to pass its dividend.
'Whilst it's only a modest profit, it's obviously a milestone,' said Mr Jim
Maxmin, the American who became chief executive in 1991.
But Mr Maxmin said Laura Ashley's performance did not reflect a general
pick-up in high street sales, where he claimed the improvement experienced
by some retailers was due to heavy discounting.
Turnover fell to Pounds 248m (Pounds 263m), but Mr Maxmin said this
reflected the group's concentration on building gross margins rather than
turnover.
A reorganisation of its US division, including cutting buying to reduce a
large stock surplus, led to the virtual collapse of its haphazard
distribution system, and the division plunged to a Pounds 6.9m operating
loss.
But Mr Maxmin insisted yesterday that the problems in the US were
operational, rather than problems with the Laura Ashley brand. He was
determined to bring them under control by the end of the year, using the
same 'Simplify, Focus, Act' formula employed in the UK and Europe.
The US loss contributed to a Pounds 2m reduction in group operating profits
to Pounds 1.1m.
Profits from associated businesses also declined from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds
1.5m, reflecting the high costs of opening shops in Asia, which are carried
by Laura Ashley's Japanese joint venture. But interest payments fell from
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 0.8m.
Operating profits in the UK retail business improved from Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 5.6m. A strong turnround in the second half saw garment sales
increase 3 per cent, following a 14 per cent fall in the first half. Sales
in the current year were running some 30 per cent ahead of last year, Mr
Maxmin said.
Furnishings sales grew in the second half for the first time since 1988, and
were currently 9 per cent ahead.
In Europe, like-for-like sales - which exclude those in newly-opened stores
 -improved 12 per cent for garments and 4 per cent for furnishings.

FT  16 APR 93 / Debt-laden USAir asks for cash with Dollars 260m new shares
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways invested Dollars 300m for a
potential 19.9 per cent voting interest earlier this year, is continuing
efforts to improve its debt-laden balance sheet with an offering of up to
Dollars 260m-worth of ordinary shares.
The company said yesterday it plans to sell 10m new shares to investors  -
or up to 11.5m, if underwriters' overallotment options are added in.
Hampered by its poor financial condition and uncertainty over its future,
USAir has not tapped the equity market since 1987 - in contrast to larger US
competitors like American, United and Delta Air Lines - although it has sold
debt securities.
USAir filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The
document suggested the maximum offering price for the new shares would be
Dollars 22.50. At this price and assuming the full 11.5m shares are taken
up, the issue could raise just under Dollars 260m.
Yesterday, USAir shares - which were suspended briefly on the New York Stock
Exchange - closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 21 3/4 .
USAir's filing was vague about the reasons for the offering, saying only the
proceeds would be used for 'general corporate purposes'. But most of the
Dollars 300m which the carrier received from BA went towards paying down its
Dollars 600m revolving credit facility. USAir's long-term debt at end-1992
stood at over Dollars 2bn.
Under its investment agreement with USAir, British Airways has certain
rights to buy shares of preferred stock, convertible into USAir common
stock, to maintain its underlying interest when the US carrier goes ahead
with an equity issue. But yesterday morning the UK-based airline was
considering how to respond to USAir's announcement and had no comment on
whether those rights would be exercised.
USAir's offering comes in the wake of a rally in US airline stocks and amid
much new stock offering in the US. In the first quarter, for example,
corporate America raised around Dollars 22bn in new equity issues - slightly
more than in the same period of 1992.
The fillip in airline shares reflects hopes that the US government's
attention to the industry's problems and the absence of savage domestic
price-wars may allow stronger carriers to return to profitability this year.

FT  16 APR 93 / Forte cuts dividend, sees no green shoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotel and restaurants group, yesterday cut its dividend for the
first time in two decades, warned that there were few signs of a business
upturn and said it would be reducing US operations.
Forte reported pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 31 of Pounds
164m after exceptional items, using the FRS 3 standard. This compared with a
restated Pounds 59m for 1991-92. Pre-tax profits before its share in Savoy
Hotel, exceptional items and property revaluations were Pounds 72m, compared
with Pounds 70m last time. Earnings per share were 14.1p (4.3p).
The final dividend of 4.75p produced a total of 7.5p (9.91p). Mr Rocco
Forte, chairman, said: 'We feel it prudent to set the dividend at a level
which would be sustainable even if there is no upturn in trading conditions
and which will provide a basis for future growth.'
The group is offering shareholders the alternative of an enhanced scrip
dividend with a value 50 per cent higher than the cash payout.
Mr Forte said trading conditions deteriorated last year and that the
situation had not improved. 'The green shoots that seem to be appearing are
not appearing in our business yet,' he said.
He said, however, that the group's cost reduction programme should produce
improved profits even without a rapid recovery in demand. Over the past two
years, total staff numbers have been reduced by 7,000 to 38,500.
Forte says it is putting 15 of its US Travelodge hotels up for sale,
allowing it to concentrate on the remaining motel operations, which might be
floated off in 18 months' time. Mr Forte said plans to expand on the
Continent would be postponed, since better deals would be available in a
year's time.
There were exceptional charges of Pounds 73m for reorganisation, rebranding
and software. The intended disposal of the Travelodge hotels and other
property losses produced an exceptional charge of Pounds 91m. The sale of
the Gardner Merchant contract catering business produced an exceptional gain
of Pounds 257m.
A revaluation of the entire property portfolio produced a reduction in the
revaluation surplus of Pounds 344m. As a result, gearing rose to 48.4 per
cent.

FT  16 APR 93 / RMC and Blue Circle set to raise prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading building material suppliers, RMC Group, the ready-mixed concrete
company, and Blue Circle, the UK's largest cement maker, indicated that they
would increase prices in the UK in the next few weeks.
Both companies reported results for 1992 yesterday, showing sharp falls in
UK profits. Each said they expected price rises to be effective, in spite of
likely further volume falls. RMC's shares rose 21p to 629p and Blue Circle's
were up 3 1/2 p to 241p.
Mr Jim Owen, managing director of RMC, the UK's leading ready mixed concrete
supplier and the largest buyer of cement, said 1992 'was a damned difficult
year, particularly in the UK'. He said the timing of any recovery was
uncertain, but took hope from a pick-up in housing activity. He added that
price increases 'will be a very important factor in a recovery in UK
profits'. RMC's UK operating profits have fallen from Pounds 132m in 1989 to
Pounds 10.2m in 1992.
RMC is putting up sand and gravel prices by between 6 per cent and 7 per
cent on May 1, and is considering a concrete price rise. Analysts said RMC
is such a large customer of Blue Circle that the latter's price rise would
depend on RMC raising its concrete prices.
Mr Ian McKenzie, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, said 'we believe the
majority of our customers are ready to support a price increase'. He said
customers will be notified about the size of the increase - likely to
average between 2 and 3 1/2 per cent - 'very shortly'.
BCC said UK cement volumes fell 12 per cent in 1992 and prices fell 2 per
cent. It expected a further volume decline of about 5 per cent in 1993.
Mr John Cooper, head of RMC's UK concrete operations, said its volumes fell
8 per cent in 1992 and the business barely broke even. 1993 would be
'tricky' with further volume falls, but, he added, 'the worst is behind us'.
Both groups have cut capacity in response to falling demand. BCC is in the
middle of a Pounds 58m restructuring programme aimed at reducing capacity
and cutting costs. RMC said the ready-mix concrete industry had rationalised
with many smaller players failing, withdrawing or being taken over.

FT  16 APR 93 / Wings of song bring Argentaria to market: Spain's big
privatisation, overshadowed only by the coming election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERA lovers recognise the swirling music as the Slaves' Chorus from Verdi's
Nabucco. Spaniards, who now hear it incessantly on their radio stations, are
being roused by the chant into becoming shareholders of a state-controlled
banking corporation.
With just a week to go before the subscription period opens in the Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) partial privatisation of Argentaria, well over 300,000
members of the domestic public have, in less than a month, telephoned to
register their readiness to invest in its equity.
Argentaria's chairman, Mr Francisco Luzon, said in February that he hoped to
have 200,000 shareholders in the planned placement of up to 25 per cent of
the banking corporation's stock. He could now have double that number.
Around 12m Argentaria shares, representing some 42 per cent of the equity
being privatised, are being offered to the home retail market.
Spaniards may invest a minimum of Pta25,000 (Pounds 143) and a maximum of
Pta8m (Pounds 45,700) in the shares which will be priced, within a range of
Pta3,500 to Pta3,950, on or around April 23.
There is a second Spanish tranche aimed at the institutional market, a third
for Argentaria's employees and a further four tranches, totalling some 8m
shares, to be placed in the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of
the world.
Spain's would-be shareholders seem undeterred by the snap general election
on June 6, which was called after the share offering was announced. Should
it be won by the opposition centre right - currently neck and neck with the
ruling socialists - the new government could in theory replace Argentaria's
present management team.
Following the placement, the group will make up as much as 7 per cent of the
capitalisation of the Madrid stock market, making it the biggest stock after
Telefonica, the state-controlled telecommunications group.
Argentaria, a federation of state-controlled financial institutions with 14
core business units, reported net profits of Pta67.4bn in 1992, its first
full financial year, and average total assets of Pta9,717bn, the second
largest among Spain's banking groups.
Analysts expect it to overtake Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, currently ranked eighth
among financial institutions in the FT's European Top 500, to become Spain's
leading bank group.
Created in May 1991, Argentaria is the only Spanish financial institution
with both commercial bank and savings bank subsidiaries. This gives it a
strong domestic customer base, enhanced by the fact that Caja Postal, its
saving bank unit, is the only caja in the country that is not tied to a
specific region.
Argentaria is run in a strikingly decentralised fashion. At the centre is Mr
Luzon, with a staff of 40, setting group strategy and co-ordinating the
individual business units.
These include a merchant bank, a bank dealing with local government
financing and another serving the agri-business sector, three 'para-banking'
companies dealing with brokerage and fund management and a further four
non-banking ones that provide insurance and property services. Each unit has
its own board of directors and its own profit and loss account.
In the long run, the test will be whether Argentaria is able to combine this
decentralised management with the cross-selling opportunities it hopes for.
As an example, the group points to the way Banco Hipotecario Espanol (BHE),
Argentaria's property financing unit and the only specialist mortgage bank
in Spain, has got together with Caja Postal to offer savings accounts to
home buyers.
BHE has only 50 offices; until now, most of its 800,000 mortgage holders
have held their accounts elsewhere. Last year 85 per cent of BHE's 40,000
new clients opened accounts with Caja Postal.
Argentaria hopes to make gains on costs, too, citing the way it has trimmed
its seven information systems down to two, saving Pta2bn a year in capital
spending and a further Pta2bn a year in running costs.
In the short run, the biggest influence on Argentaria's results will be the
extent to which it can extend across the group the gains in efficiency
already achieved by Banco Exterior, its flagship.
Mr Luzon, formerly managing director at the merged Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, was
appointed to run Banco Exterior in 1988.
His brief from the government was to convert Exterior from an export credit
agency into an aggressive international bank. Mr Luzon raised the bank's
return on assets from 0.33 per cent in 1988 to 0.75 per cent in 1990 and
0.83 per cent in 1992, a figure on a par with its private sector rivals.
Those gains achieved, analysts are now forecasting modest growth for
Exterior, which provided 49 per cent of Argentaria's pre-tax profits in
1992.
The task of rapid profits growth now falls to the group's other units, which
only came under Mr Luzon's aegis in May 1991.
Likely priorities include:
Argentaria Bolsa, the group's broking unit. The size and strength of the
group's balance sheet should allow this unit to boost its derivatives and
capital markets activities. Trading volumes at Argentaria Bolsa rose 40 per
cent last year.
The mutual funds managed by the insurance unit. Argentaria is currently
ranked only fifth among Spanish banks in the volume of mutual funds under
management. It plans to raise these funds by 40-45 per cent this year, from
their current level of Pta330bn.
Mr Luzon is a Socialist government appointee and a close friend of Mr Carlos
Solchaga, the finance minister. Though he has strengthened the group's
management by hiring more than 70 former Vizcaya executives, he remains the
key to Argentaria's future.
It is ironic, therefore, that the flotation coincides with an election that
could cost him his job. Moral: companies that link their fate to opera must
expect a little last-act melodrama.

FT  16 APR 93 / Banks may sell O&amp;Y stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL group of banks is examining ways to dispose of the majority
shareholdings, worth more than CDollars 1bn (Pounds 512m), which they
control in Abitibi-Price, one of the world's biggest newsprint producers,
and Gulf Canada Resources, the Canadian energy group.
The shares are nominally owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property
developer, which pledged them as collateral for a USDollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.6bn) syndicated loan from the banks. But under a debt-restructuring plan
which took effect last month, the lenders have effective control of almost
all O&amp;Y's shares.
Options being considered include seeking new 'strategic' shareholders
willing to buy a substantial block of shares in either company, and a
distribution of shares through an international public offering.
The banks, led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, have appointed Salomon
Brothers of New York and RBC Dominion Securities of Toronto to advise them
on the best way of maximising the value of their collateral.
Representatives of the two investment banks have already interviewed Abitibi
and Gulf executives and are expected to submit a report to the banks within
the next month.
The timing of a sale is uncertain. At current share prices, the banks would
fall far short of recouping the full amount of their loan. The 79 per cent
stake in Abitibi pledged to the banks is worth about CDollars 780m. Of O&amp;Y's
75 per cent interest in Gulf Canada, the 70 per cent stake provided as
security is valued at just over CDollars 520m. Abitibi is gradually
recovering from a deep slump in the North American forestry industry.
However, Gulf Canada continues to experience severe financial problems.
Gulf, which has a debt load of CDollars 1.6bn, lost CDollars 252m from
continuing operations last year and has suspended dividends.
HSBC provided Dollars 750m of the syndicated loan. Other participants were
Credit Lyonnais, Commerzbank, Royal Bank of Canada and Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
In anticipation of a change in ownership, Abitibi and Gulf - in consultation
with the banks - have each named three new directors to replace members of
O&amp;Y's Reichmann family and their nominees. The same three people have been
appointed to each board.

FT  16 APR 93 / Rail strike will close network after union rejects BR's plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S railway network faces shutdown today in the second 24-hour strike
in a fortnight, in spite of last-minute efforts by British Rail management
urging staff to work as normal.
BR says the strike will cost a further Pounds 10m in lost gross revenue and
will threaten long-term business contracts.
The action follows the acrimonious breakdown of talks on Wednesday between
BR and the main RMT rail union which is demanding a guarantee of no
compulsory redundancies and a moratorium on contract work ahead of the
industry's privatisation.
Yesterday BR management encouraged staff to reconsider their strike action.
The RMT commented last night: 'They tried that tactic last time and it did
not work. And it will not work now.'
Members of Aslef, the drivers' union, are also on strike today over changes
in their national agreement, in spite of talks with BR last night that were
described as 'constructive'.
The BR-Aslef negotiations were adjourned after 75 minutes and will be
resumed on Monday. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, said there
was a 'willingness on both sides to find a solution', but Aslef said it was
too late to call off its 24-hour strike.
In the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, denounced the strike as
'utterly futile' and a 'throwback to the 1960s'.
The government and the Confederation of British Industry urged people to try
and work as normal, although car parking restrictions will not be lifted.
Many people will work from home. In London, the Underground and the buses
are running as normal.
BR fears that many business customers and individual travellers will stop
using the railway network.
The Royal Mail said it was hiring four extra flights capable of carrying
400,000 letters to boost the network of 32 chartered aircraft that already
carry mail around Britain.
National Express, the coach company, said extra coaches were being laid on
for cross-Pennine routes; those linking London with Scotland; and the main
commuter routes into London from the south coast, Cambridge and Milton
Keynes. Gatwick airport is providing extra coaches for the link between the
airport and Victoria station in London.

FT  16 APR 93 / Review of English fuels education row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRICTER standards for spoken English in schools and tougher requirements
for teaching Shakespeare are features of radical revisions proposed for the
English national curriculum.
The proposals, announced yesterday by the National Curriculum Council, could
affect all teaching of English in England and Wales. They streamline the
curriculum currently in place and include exhaustive lists of recommended
reading for children up to the age of 16. The number of attainment targets,
or requirements, that children must satisfy during their schooling has been
cut from 159 to 99.
However, the review has added fuel to the confrontation between the
government and teachers' unions over tests for the national curriculum,
which are due to start in June. Opposition politicians attacked the timing
of the proposals, which come only a week after Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, announced a review of the full national curriculum.
All pupils will now be required to read one Shakespeare play between the
ages of 11 and 14 and another by the age of 16. Teachers complained that
that was unrealistic for less able pupils.
There were also doubts about the rules for spoken English. Under the
proposals, primary school teachers would be expected to correct pupils at
Key Stage One (between the ages of five and seven) for making ungrammatical
comments such as: 'We was robbed', and 'We winned at football'.
By Key Stage Two (for 11-year-olds), pupils should be proficient in
'standard English' and should not make mistakes such as: 'Pass me them
books', and 'We haven't seen nobody'.
Mr David Pascall, chairman of the NCC, said: 'By standard English we mean
correct vocabulary and grammar spoken in any accent, with clear diction.'
He added that a command of such English would benefit children in their
'social and professional development', and that the move had been made
necessary by falling standards.
'Does anyone have any serious doubt if we listen to the English in the
playground, in the street and sometimes in the media that we have to raise
standards?' he asked.
Mr Patten said: 'The new proposals will simplify the present English
curriculum by reducing the number of requirements to be satisfied. But they
will increase rigour by making those statements more precise and amenable to

But Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, called for a moratorium on
all changes to the curriculum until the full review had been completed.
There will now be three months of public consultation, and the resulting
guidelines will be introduced in schools between 1994 and 1995.

FT  16 APR 93 / Boost for hopes of upturn as house sales show rise of 40%:
Caution urged over optimistic reports by some estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of an upturn in the UK housing market came yesterday as
estate agencies owned by leading building societies reported increases of up
to 40 per cent in house sales in the first quarter of the year, reinforcing
hopes of a brighter economic outlook.
The rises, compared with the same period last year, were announced on the
day one of the main bodies in the estate agency industry reported a 36.4 per
cent increase in the number of contracts exchanged in March compared with
February.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at UBS, warned against talking
up the market. 'We are seeing a return to 1992 levels of activity before the
reintroduction of stamp duty and no one thought that 1992 was wonderful for
the market,' he said.
A further caution against over optimism at signs of 'green shoots' in the
economy was signalled yesterday by the engineering industry which said the
fragile recovery in UK engineering output was being threatened by deepening
recession in vital European export markets.
Mr Peter Constable, chairman of the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents,
an industry-appointed body, said confidence was strengthening in the housing
market.
The organisation said the contract exchanges reported by its members in
March totalled 35,285, a 36.4 per cent increase on February, compared with a
low last year of 19,027 in September. The March figure represented a more
modest 12.5 per cent increase on March 1992, when the exchanges reported
were 31,351.
Some of the largest building societies also reported increased sales by
their estate agencies. Mr Alan McLintock, chairman of the Woolwich building
society, the fourth largest lender, said yesterday that its estate agency
arm, Woolwich Property Services, had reported an increase in sales of 40 per
cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period last
year.
'There are concrete signs of the long awaited revival in the housing
market,' said Mr McLintock at the society's annual general meeting in
London.
Alliance &amp; Leicester Property Services said it had seen a year-on-year
increase of 38 per cent in sales, while Nationwide Estate Agents reported a
33 per cent increase in sales in the first quarter of the year compared with
last year. Abbey National's Cornerstone estate agency reported a 20 per cent
first quarter increase in sales compared with last year.
Mr John St. Lawrence, chairman of Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based
housebuilder, was also optimistic at the company's annual general meeting
yesterday. He said visitor levels across the company's sites and open market
reservations since mid-February were above the same period in 1992.
But Halifax Property Services, the estate agency arm of the largest lender,
said it had seen a rise of 7 per cent in year-on-year sales. This was in
line with OCEA figures for gross monthly sales - offers accepted - which
were up 7 per cent last year compared with March 1992.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Laura Ashley's new company doctors are clearly learning retailing on the
job. The grievous self-inflicted wound in the US - where the board started
surgery before properly diagnosing the problem - shows that clearly enough.
The Pounds 6.9m loss is all the more painful because it could have been
avoided if the working capital problems of the US shops had been properly
understood. It is also a shock that the company's internal controls were so
poor. The main board seems to have had no idea that the US distribution
system had been a complete shambles for years.
At least the problem is now under control. Mr Jim Maxmin, the new chief
executive, is taking some sensible basic steps to improve the performance of
the stores. In particular, the move away from discounting towards managing
the brand is surely right. Despite the company's best efforts, the Laura
Ashley image has proved resilient. Many of its remaining problems can be
tackled by managers rather than retailing geniuses.
If the retailing operations need only a firm hand and common sense, the
future of the manufacturing operations is more murky. Indeed, investors
might be more prepared to back the company's recovery story with hard cash
if they had a clearer view of what was going on in that area. The hope is
that Mr Maxmin is in a position to tell them.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Building materials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt by building materials companies to force through higher prices is
a sure sign of spring. Having been disappointed so often in the past,
yesterday's aggressive noises from Blue Circle and RMC might seem like hot
air. Yet both have a fair chance of making higher prices stick this time.
Capacity has been taken out of both cement and concrete - witness Blue
Circle's Pounds 62m restructuring charge. RMC barely broke even in UK
concrete last year, so it can hardly stand by and watch prices erode
further. RMC is also Blue Circle's biggest customer; that both companies are
talking tough suggests a degree of common purpose.
That does not guarantee an immediate profits recovery for either company.
Volumes are likely to be lower this year. Even if the housing market comes
back from the dead, commercial building remains in the doldrums. By reducing
capacity and fixed costs, Blue Circle may be better geared to price
increases, but the full benefits of restructuring will not flow through
until 1994. RMC may have to live with undisciplined competition in the
fragmented concrete market.
With a stronger balance sheet, a covered dividend and profitable German
operations, though, RMC is in better shape to live with another
disappointment. Housing the influx of immigrants into Germany is big
business for concrete producers even while the wider economy is sliding. In
contrast Blue Circle's acquisition of French boiler-maker Celsius looks
badly-timed. Yesterday's uncovered pay-out and asset revaluation eat into a
balance sheet damaged by goodwill write-offs. A 6 per cent yield on the
shares should provide some support, but Blue Circle needs a smart recovery
in UK profits to justify the dividend.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Scrip dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte was not alone in slipping in an enhanced scrip dividend yesterday.
Having mulled the option since its results last month, Redland did the same.
The two cases are different, but they do suggest the fashion is becoming
worryingly popular. One way of looking at Forte's decision, for example, is
that, far from just cutting its dividend, it is trying to avoid paying one
in cash at all. A feature of the scheme is that the requirements of those
shareholders who do want cash are met by the placement of fresh shares in
the market.
In Forte's case, the decision looks suspiciously like a response to its
cash-flow constraints. The company points to the contribution the savings
will make to finance its acquisition of the Relais motorway service areas in
France on which it expects a return of 15 per cent. But it had acquired
those anyway last year.
Redland's geographically uneven earnings flow has given it an acute ACT
problem. The enhanced scrip dividend reduces its tax obligations and
transfers financial benefit from the government to shareholders. From that
perspective the move will enhance earnings in the short run. Even so, one
wonders whether, after all the shares it issued to pay for Steetley, Redland
really deserves the extra capital. It is a pity the ACT system has
encouraged the market to forget the discipline inherent in the need to pay
cash dividends.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Rocco in a hard place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If business is as bad as Forte claims, it must regret that the Grosvenor
House is unlikely to host another Christmas party for the EBRD this year. By
and large it is getting no benefit from recovery and almost all the trading
profit improvement during the second half reflected cost savings. That gives
a certain intellectual justification for cutting the dividend. The practical
reason is even more compelling. Forte's balance sheet looks strained despite
the Gardner Merchant sale. At some stage it will still need a rights issue.
With the dividend cut to a level that should allow room for growth as
earnings recover, Forte will have a more encouraging story to tell when the
moment for the rights issue eventually comes. It has also used the Gardner
Merchant disposal profits to shield a kitchen sink approach to exceptional
charges. That will boost the chances of an earnings recovery whatever
happens to the economy. Similarly, the rigour applied to property valuations
will maximise the disposal profit allowable under the new accounting rules
from any hotels that are sold.
In the midst of this, Mr Rocco Forte looks surprisingly cheerful. Perhaps
the new non-executive directors have strengthened his determination to break
with the traditions established by his father, but that does not give him a
free hand with strategy. Talk of further expansion in Europe is muted now,
and the emphasis is on further disposals, starting with the loss-making
Travelodge hotels. All in all, the company is talking of eventual disposals
worth Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m. That is a measure of the extent to which
Forte must shrink before it can grow again.

FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: Italy's big bang
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR SEVERAL months now, next Sunday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
when Italians are called on to vote in eight referendums - has been
virtually the only fixed point in a rapidly disintegrating Italian political
universe. Not surprisingly, therefore, politicians and the media have seized
on the occasion as the starting point of a new era. It is no good imagining,
however, that the following days will reveal a ready-furnished political
landscape. Whatever the voting figures, the scene next week will resemble
the scene this week. The parties and the men who dominated Italian politics
since the second world war have been demolished. New ones have yet to
emerge.
Most of the eight questions on the ballot papers are best described as
populist-nihilist.
The one that comes nearest to expressing the popular mood is that which
seeks to end state subsidies to political parties - and may thereby drive
them to rely even more in future on unorthodox sources of funds. But the one
that is seen as providing the key to Italy's political future is that which
would replace, for two-thirds of the seats in the upper house, the
traditional party-list proportional electoral system with a British-style
majority one.
All parties have now rallied to this proposal, which in the present
atmosphere may be enough to sink it. But if it does pass with a thumping
majority, as expected, it is assumed that parliament will feel obliged to
enact the same system for the lower house, too, and that new elections would
then soon be held.
The effect of such a change in 'normal' times would be to give an overall
majority to the largest party - until now, always the Christian Democrats.
In these abnormal times the outcome is much harder to predict, but one
effect would almost certainly be to increase the strength of parties whose
support is regionally concentrated, such as the Lombard League, thereby
increasing the danger that Italy will fragment.
Whatever the electoral system, democratic politics require strong parties
with clear programmes; and effective government will probably require
constitutional as well as electoral reform. An upheaval as revolutionary as
that now sweeping through Italian politics calls for an elected assembly
with a mandate to revise the constitution, while day-to-day affairs are
managed by a broad-based caretaker government under a non-party figure
commanding general respect. Mr Giuliano Amato, the current prime minister,
can hardly be that figure, though he has done a remarkable job considering
the circumstances.
Meanwhile the investigation into corruption, and into the even worse
allegations now surfacing against veteran political leaders, must be carried
through. When the full truth is known there may be a case for clemency. But
the Italian people would be rightly intolerant of further attempts to keep
any part of the truth a secret from them.

It is hard to imagine a fund manager as a heroic figure, but Robert
Cottrell, who used to pen this column, has fingered one in his book on The
End of Hong Kong.
John Greenwood, chief economist of the GT fund management group, gets a
special mention in dispatches for his sterling work during a particularly
nasty run on the Hong Kong dollar 10 years ago. Local shops had begun
posting signs that they would accept only US dollars and nobody had much of
a clue how to solve the crisis.
No one, that is, apart from Greenwood who had published a paper on 'How to
rescue the Hong Kong dollar', which he had circulated to economists such as
Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. One Saturday afternoon, at the height of
the crisis, he was invited to the Hong Kong monetary affairs department to
discuss his plan. Greenwood came away thinking that he hadn't convinced the
officials of his case.
However, a few days later, HK followed his advice, pegged its exchange rate,
and the HK government won all the credit. 'For my money Greenwood deserved a
knighthood,' says Cottrell, who is already researching his next tome, a
biography of President Mitterrand.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Giving Lord Younger the chairmanship of the four main investment trusts in
the Murray Johnstone stable may be good for Scotland Inc, but what message
does it send to small shareholders?
Lord Younger is a decent chap. A former secretary of state for Scotland and
Tory party big-wig, he is starting to make his mark in business as chairman
of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Since quitting politics, he has been
acquiring a portfolio, such as directorships of Scottish Equitable Life and
Murray Johnstone Holdings itself, that one has come to expect of Scotland's
establishment financiers.
Murray Johnstone, controlled by the four trusts Lord Younger chairs, does
not put its fund managers on the boards of the trusts it manages. So the
non-execs can theoretically fire the managers. True, the arguments are
tangled because firing the managers would damage the trust's investment in
the management company.
Even so, having the same chairman and several of the same non-execs sitting
on the different trust boards as well as the parent of the fund manager,
seems a trifle incestuous especially when investment trusts are trying to
sell themselves to small shareholders as independent companies.
One investment trust chairmanship should have been quite enough for Lord
Younger. Or is it a case of the more the murrayer?

Judging by Lady Thatcher's performance this week, the former prime
minister's ability to catch the public mood is as uncanny as ever. But is
her high-level access to world leaders just as assured?
Certainly, she can still pull the big crowds on the international lecture
circuit, and her schedule in Warsaw, where she opens one of her Foundation's
offices tomorrow, sounds as hectic as ever. But there is some surprise that
President Lech Walesa is not on the Thatcher itinerary.
True, the Polish president tends to go home to Gdansk at weekends. But he
still likes to receive foreign big-wigs at his shipyard in order to
underline Poland's industrial possibilities. Indeed, Lady T popped in there
during her 1988 visit, much to the consternation of the ruling communists.
But it's understood that Walesa is too busy to see the Iron Lady this time
round. A sign that she - or Walesa - are past their prime?

Reconciliation is in the air in the Anglo-French fishing dispute. French

Observer can exclusively reveal that Admiral Sir Benjamin Bathurst, the
First Sea Lord, has been sent a new Union Jack by Jean Le Boucher, president
of the Basse-Normandie regional fisheries committee.
The original from the patrol craft HMS Blazer, mistakenly reported at the
time to be a White Ensign, was set alight during a protest in Cherbourg
marina on March 28.
The new one will be given to Blazer's commander, who is expected to frame it
for display rather than assign it to the flag locker. However, sensitivities
are still raw enough for the Navy to have decided against publicising the
French gesture. Gotcha]-style headlines might just set tempers ablaze again.

FT  16 APR 93 / Pioneer looks east for profit: The challenges facing ABB's
engineering ventures in the former communist bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years after the fall of the Berlin wall, western industry has still not
quite made up its mind about eastern Europe. The opportunities are plainly
there. But, as most of the pioneers have found, so are the problems.
An excellent case study is provided by one of the most successful of these
pioneers, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineer Asea Brown Boveri. ABB now
controls about 20 companies across eastern Europe, mostly former state
monopolies. They make money, if not yet enough to cover the cost of buying
them. They employ some 20,000 people in the region. In five years, ABB aims
to double that.
Talking to those employees today produces a striking story of a clash of
cultures: one driven by production, the other by marketing and finance. In
the old socialist system, says the head of ABB's Hungarian operation,
'people had no feeling for money'. But the system also produced a proud
tradition of engineering. ABB's new workers were mostly eager to embrace
western techniques of management, if only to secure their jobs in a
capitalist world. When it came to their technical skills, they were less
ready to be pushed around.
The German head of ABB Lummus Chemoprojekt, an engineering firm based in the
Czech city of Brno, says: 'You need to be sensitive to what people have done
for the past 25 years, which is to be good engineers.' The second in command
at ABB's Prague head office, an Americanised Czech, puts it more bluntly:
'You can't just say 'wake up guys, everything you've been doing is crap;
let's start from the beginning.' '
But the implied antithesis between eastern engineering skill and western
business methods is essentially false. ABB's western managers agree in their
respect for the technical competence produced by the old system. But when it
came to advanced technology, ABB's new eastern companies had nothing to
offer. Even the turbines and switchgear they turned out were mostly
old-style ABB products made under licences signed in the old communist days.
Updating that technology took time. 'From the beginning', says a director of
ABB's Polish business, 'our approach was to transfer the software first, the
hardware second. We began with a lot of training, for instance in marketing
and sales. Then we started the technological transfer. You don't give a kid
an expensive toy before he knows how to play with it.'
There was a similar gap in factory management. A Polish manager at ABB's
huge Zamech plant, at Elblag in northern Poland, recalls the old days. 'We
were extremely centralised here. We had one manufacturing plant for
everything, with one manufacturing director in charge. Every product was
designed in one central design office: turbines, ship's propellers,
gearboxes. In one process office, they prepared production sheets for marine
products and turbines. We had central purchasing. We had huge overheads. It
was a stupid way of doing things.'
By another quirk of the system, Zamech had to take raw materials in huge
bulk simply to ensure supply - 'minimum deliveries of 10 tonnes of a raw
material, even when we needed only 200kg', the manager says. Since ABB took
over in 1991, inventories have been slashed from over 200 days' sales to
less than 60. The factory area, meanwhile, has been halved for the same
level of output.
The ABB revolution involved other sensitivities. Mr Pavel Olechnowicz, chief
executive of the Zamech plant, says: 'We can change at the top quickly, and
we can then educate the shop floor through training programmes. The big
problem is those in the middle.'
Significantly, Mr Olechnowicz comes new to the job. Shortly before the ABB
takeover, the Zamech workers' council decided to get rid of the old chief
executive and elect a new one. Mr Olechnowicz was plucked from the humble
job of foundry manager to run the whole plant. 'I find it easier to change
my mentality than some of my colleagues,' he says. 'I had limited experience
of the old system.'
Others are less fortunate. Across ABB's eastern empire, one meets senior
managers who are clearly struggling to adjust. These men had spent their
lives working their way to the top of huge organisations, responsible not
just for output but for social life and the surrounding infrastructure. They
are now mere production managers, subject to whippersnappers at head office
who are young enough to master the new skills of finance, marketing and the
English language.
But at least the whippersnappers are mostly local in origin. The
alternative, imposing western management, seems more problematic again. One
of ABB's Hungarian managers spent some months working for a
Hungarian-Italian joint venture, and did not relish the experience. 'There
were 40 Italians in charge, with 40 interpreters', he says. 'No decision
could be taken without at least two Italian signatures. They didn't trust
their own staff.' He draws a blunt conclusion. 'Foreign managers don't
understand the Hungarian way of life. The workers don't accept them.'
Local sensibilities can be offended in other ways. An example much quoted in
Hungary is the 1990 takeover of the lighting manufacturer Tungsram by
General Electric of the US. The deal proved disastrous, with GE sinking
Dollars 500m in a venture which is still heavily loss-making. More important
for GE's local reputation, it was also obliged to axe 18,000 jobs from a
workforce of 28,000.
ABB has proved more adroit. Its method was to negotiate in advance precisely
how much of the business it wanted to take on. The ancillary services, down
to the works canteen, the barber shop or the haulage business, were left
with the state or hived off to management buyouts. Manufacturing employees,
from top management down, were picked individually by interview. As an ABB
executive puts it, 'we don't take the lazy ones, or the ones who are set in
their ways. We leave them to the state.'
It might be asked what ABB gets in return for all this effort. That involves
a strategic question which goes to the heart of the whole issue of
investment in eastern Europe. Is ABB there to develop the local market, or
to switch production from its high-cost plants in the west?
Mr David Hunter, the American president of ABB's Polish operation, says:
'Originally, much of the idea was that Poland could become the Taiwan of
Europe. That's still part of ABB's thinking. But as we get smarter about the
Polish market, we see the potential here.'
What Mr Hunter has in mind is the rebuilding of Poland's infrastructure, its
power industry in particular. 'In power generation, if you include the
modernisation of obsolete plant and cleaning up the rest, there's 10 or 20
years of business.'
Who will fund that is another question. The problem, Mr Hunter says, is
Russia. 'There's a big black hole to the east of us, and if nothing is done
about it that could be catastrophic. In that context, Poland has a very low
priority. The soft loans from the west will go clear over our heads.'
Ultimately, ABB clearly still hopes to switch some production to the east.
The process will be slow. With the power generation industry still in
recession worldwide and ABB's western plants suffering from idle capacity,
now is not the time to make matters worse.
Despite that, it is hard not to be impressed by the high spirits of ABB's
eastern management. They have seen the western future, and it works. ABB's
western competitors might also ponder a simple fact. ABB Zamech made a net
profit margin in 1991-92 - on ABB's accounting principles - of some 9 per
cent on about Dollars 100m of turnover. Next year's margin is expected to be
higher. If that can be achieved when the region is in chaotic transition,
ABB could be on to something.

FT  16 APR 93 / Sainsbury cleans up: A supermarket's detergent is leaving
the market leaders on the shelf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In few consumer markets is the battle for shelf space as ferocious as in
household detergents, and in fewer still are the protagonists as powerful as
Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. The two companies dominate the business in
most countries except Japan and spend huge sums on research, product
development and marketing.
But recently an upstart has contested their supremacy in Britain's Pounds
800m-a-year laundry detergents market, where their combined share of more
than 80 per cent is among the highest in the world.
The success of the new arrival, Novon, not only challenges recent trends in
the detergents industry; if its initial momentum is sustained, it could
herald a serious longer-term threat to the market power of P&amp;G and Unilever.
The Novon range was launched last autumn, not by a manufacturer but by J.
Sainsbury, the grocery chain, which sells a fifth of all detergents bought
in Britain.
Sainsbury says Novon, which undercuts prices of established brands by as
much as 25 per cent, now accounts for more than a quarter of its total
laundry detergent sales by volume, a fifth of basic powders and 40 per cent
of concentrated powders and liquids.
Own-label products are common in many grocery lines and provide two-thirds
of Sainsbury's total sales. However, they have made few inroads until now in
detergents, partly because P&amp;G and Unilever have invested heavily to support
their brands. Last year, they spent about Pounds 80m on advertising in
Britain.
Since the mid-1980s the two companies have further raised the competitive
stakes through sharply increased investment in technology and new products.
Persil, Unilever's flagship brand, which was available in only two versions
a decade ago, now comes in 25.
Sainsbury knew it was taking on daunting odds. It had already launched an
unsuccessful own-label line, Wash and Care, in the late 1980s. It tried
again, it says, because it was keen to widen the chain's strong brand image
beyond food sales - and because of the juicy profit margins available on
detergents.
This time, the company left little to chance. Novon is its most ambitious
product development and involved unusually extensive market research.
However, the 18-month programme cost less than Pounds 2m, a pittance by the
standards of P&amp;G and Unilever.
Sainsbury began by analysing why Wash and Care had failed and concluded it
had underestimated the importance of product features such as particle size,
colour and fragrance. These were given much closer attention in the new
range. Novon was chosen from a short-list of 20 names drawn up by an outside
agency, while a design consultancy was brought in to develop packaging
intended to evoke the imagery of P&amp;G's Ariel and Unilever's Persil.
To ensure uniform quality and regular delivery, production of Novon was
entrusted to a single manufacturer - believed to be McBride, a BP
subsidiary.
Though backed by less than Pounds 200,000 in newspaper advertising to date,
Novon has been strongly promoted in Sainsbury stores, where it is displayed
separately from competing products.
Publicly, P&amp;G and Unilever profess not to be worried by Novon - though both
have recently responded with leaflet campaigns warning against 'cheap
imitations'. Privately, they have good reason to be concerned.
Novon's success shows that, for all the companies' recent emphasis on
high-technology and rapid product innovation as competitive weapons, the
detergent market remains open to new entrants with slender research and
development budgets.
'Though P&amp;G and Unilever may obtain an advantage from a new idea for a short
period, everyone will be working on it. These are areas where patenting is
difficult,' says Mr Michael Rosen, Sainsbury's director of non-foods and
Novon's main sponsor. 'Some of Unilever's raw materials suppliers are
independent, so we can get supplies.'
An even more delicate problem for the two companies is how to gauge their
commercial response. They cannot afford to unleash the full force of their
market power against Sainsbury, because it is no ordinary competitor - it is
also their biggest and most powerful UK customer. 'It is obviously a complex
relationship to manage,' admits Mr Andrew Seth, managing director of Lever
Brothers, Unilever's British detergents subsidiary.
The growing power of supermarkets generally has obliged P&amp;G and Unilever to
tone down their formerly high-handed approach to the retail trade. These
days they, and other big manufacturers, talk of the need for constructive
co-operation and a relationship of equals.
However, Mr Rosen does not sound like a man in a mood to compromise. There
are already too many detergent brands on supermarket shelves, he says, and
manufacturers are 'storing up a lot of trouble for themselves' by flooding
the market with new products. 'Someone will have to decide on storage
space,' he says, adding pointedly: 'Retailers are making decisions today
that they would not have felt strong or courageous enough to make five years
ago.'
Novon, of course, has increased the squeeze on shelf space, while its sales
success promises to strengthen Sainsbury's bargaining power with P&amp;G and
Unilever by countering the power of their expensively supported brands.
For the moment, the big detergent manufacturers are watching and waiting to
see whether their precocious new rival stays the course. If it does - and if
its example is emulated by other supermarkets in the UK and the rest of
Europe - P&amp;G and Unilever may have to fight much harder to remain the
consumer's choice.

FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: Market power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NOVEMBER'S green paper on reforming the law on abuse of market power
was welcome evidence of the UK government's intention to sharpen up
competition policy. There were compelling reasons for change. The government
was committed to reforming restrictive practices legislation in line with EC
law. Leaving the law on abuse of market power unchanged would have been
inherently contradictory - and would have left UK competition policy more
obviously at odds with the rest of the Community than at present.
There was also genuine concern that the present UK system was not working.
It was weak on deterrence as well as slow and cumbersome. What was needed,
it seemed, was what already existed at EC level: clear prohibitions, backed
by substantial fines, full rights for third party redress, enforced by an
agency with strong investigatory powers.
The government's announcement that it intends just to tinker with the
present legislation is therefore a disappointment. It has been persuaded by
industry that the costs of complying with a prohibition-based system,
together with the uncertainty it would create, would outweigh any benefits
to the consumer.
There is some merit to the uncertainty argument. The handful of European
decisions and court judgments on abuse of market power underline the
difficulty in drawing lessons from the application of the EC's prohibition
regime. Industry is right to be concerned about the prospect of being fined
for behaviour which at the time it was undertaken was believed to be legal.
But the argument on the cost of compliance has been overdone. Most companies
of a size to be caught by abuse of market power laws are active in Europe,
and have already borne the costs of introducing sophisticated competition
compliance programmes.
The government's decision will leave the UK increasingly isolated in Europe.
Brussels has recently indicated that in future it intends to leave
run-of-the-mill competition cases to national authorities. Its condition for
this exercise in subsidiarity is that EC states should adopt competition
regimes based on EC rules. Most member states have already done so. Britain
runs the risk of being the odd one out.
This may not matter in the short term, but in the long run could affect its
ability to influence other areas of Community competition policy. Along with
Germany and France, Britain is used to making itself heard in Brussels on
such matters as EC merger policy. That will be harder to do if it is out on
a limb.
Meanwhile, if the government's present approach is to be effective, the
Office of Fair Trading will have to take a more pro-active role in rooting
out abuses of market power. For that, it will require more than the extra
powers which the government seems for the moment inclined to grant.

FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: G7 response to Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NOTHING else, the two-day meeting of finance and foreign ministers of the
group of seven industrial countries in Tokyo has underlined the west's
interest in Russian reform. But the G7 can only propose. It now must wait to
see how Mr Yeltsin fares in the referendum due on April 25. Unhappily, even
this seems unlikely to resolve doubts about Russia's willingness and ability
to implement radical reform.
The immediate question, however, is how much of the announced offer of
Dollars 43bn is new. The answer is that there is less to it than meets the
eye, since it consists mainly of known commitments from institutions like
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
One relatively new ingredient is an innovative Dollars 3bn IMF loan facility
to help Russia start to curb inflation and the budget deficit. There will
also be a Dollars 300m small business development fund mainly financed by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Meanwhile, the US,
Japan and the UK have announced what seem to be additional bilateral loans
of Dollars 4bn. Nevertheless, most elements were well known. Some, notably
the Dollars 15bn in debt relief agreed earlier this month, will add no new
resources, since Russia was failing to service its debts in any case.
The second question is whether offers of assistance are in the right form.
In a recent report, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe called
on the G7 to commit itself to a long-term reform programme on the scale of
the post-war Marshall plan. 'One of the worst outcomes,' it argued, 'would
be . . . a list of short-term measures hastily put together with a maximum
of publicity.'
It is far from clear that the G7 has avoided that outcome. But it has
committed itself so far that it would have to go further, should that be
justified by a serious Russian effort. The imaginative American proposal for
a Dollars 4bn fund to promote privatisation of large state-run enterprises
may yet be agreed in coming months.
The fundamental question, however, is whether there will be a Russian
programme to support. The problem is partly that there is limited agreement
in Russia on either the ends or the modalities of reform. But it is also
that the constitution is perfectly designed to prevent the emergence of
coherent structures of authority, both within Moscow and, as important,
between Moscow and the rest of this vast country.
The G7 has at least provided the moral support for Mr Yeltsin that he
wanted. The tragedy is that the G7 is at last showing serious commitment, as
Russia sinks into ever greater disarray. Mr Fyodorov, the deputy prime
minister, notes that Russia may remain unready for months. In the meantime,
the G7 should not forget that some other countries of eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union deserve assistance no less, although they too would be
greatly helped by a successful Russian reform.

FT  16 APR 93 / Personal View: Japan must now say 'no'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAGDISH BHAGWATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Shintaro Ishihara, the maverick Japanese politician and noted literary
figure, wrote in anguish an essay asking the Japanese to learn to say 'no'
to America's unceasing trade demands, it touched off a storm in the US.
Many in the US display symptoms of a 'diminished giant' syndrome in the face
of Japan's rise as an economic superpower, just as the British did when
Germany and the US emerged as rivals at the end of the 19th century. These
symptoms are so severe that rational discourse about Japan has become nearly
impossible.
The time has come for Japan to draw its line in the sand in response to the
Clinton administration's plans to muscle its way to a new, tough-minded
trade policy on Japan. This would set quantitative import shares (similar to
those for semiconductors) as targets for Japanese industries and so seek
'results' in place of rules.
Japan needs to say 'no' to such demands, which rest on fallacious economics
and are destructive of the rules-based world trading system that America's
presidents have nurtured since the second world war. But this negative
response needs to be combined with positive actions to establish Japanese
leadership of the multilateral trading system.
The present US drive to expand 'managed' or 'results-oriented' trade with
Japan, by setting quantitative import targets, derives from the conjunction
of a false premise with an unpleasant fact.
The false premise is that Japan's persistent trade surplus is proof that its
markets are closed: if manufactured goods could be sold to Japan, it is
argued, the surplus would not exist.
The unpleasant fact is that the Japanese market for manufactured goods is
open. It is even more open than those of the US and the European Community,
both of which have made copious use of voluntary export restrictions (VERs)
and anti-dumping and countervailing duties, the favoured instruments of
protectionists today. Japan has largely abstained from using such measures.
This combination of the false premise with the unpleasant fact implies that
Japan's imports must be restrained 'somehow'. The Bush administration, in
principle sensible in trade matters, decided that the problem lay in Japan's
unique cultural and institutional characteristics. The Clinton
administration, generally intemperate about trade questions, has decided
that Japan is incorrigible. Its preferred solution is to impose import
targets.
Yet the underlying premise is wrong. It is wrong even though President Bill
Clinton embraced it in his untutored remarks about Japan at his first press
conference.
Students of economics should hardly need reminding that trade barriers, as
distinct from macroeconomic policies, do not determine trade balances. But
this is not an argument that can be easily sold to politicians. Where
abstract arguments fail, examples might work instead. A graph of Japanese
trade deficits and surpluses since the second world war would show an
oscillation, as is true of most countries, even though its trade policies
have become steadily more liberal. Americans should also recall that the US
itself ran a trade surplus for many years after the second world war, even
though the US was not particularly protectionist at the time.
Japan is being unjustifiably blamed. But its acceptance of import targets in
response to a charge that is flawed in conception would be a still greater
folly. As the semiconductor case has shown, such targets would be inherently
arbitrary. There would also be no effective way for Japan to ensure that its
private industries would fulfil them. The targets would also be seen as
'export protectionism', allowing any industry with political clout to secure
guaranteed shares of foreign markets.
If the US were to obtain Japanese agreement to such targets, the EC would
not be far behind. Soon, Japan's trade would be governed by politics, not by
competition and rules. Success with an economically powerful country such as
Japan would whet the appetite for use of the same policy vis-a-vis other,
less powerful countries. The practice would spread as businesses, seeking
guaranteed market shares abroad, pressured a complacent administration
towards ever more managed trade.
Japan needs to be firmly 'rejectionist' when the Clinton administration
makes a push for managed trade. It should learn from its semiconductor
experience and heed the adage that if one gives way once, one will be asked
to yield again. But Japan should also be positive. It should propose an
international process to assess complaints of 'nullification and impairment'
of trade obligations. Such a procedure should serve as a substitute for the
establishment of import targets in industries where the US possesses only
prima facie complaints, which it too readily treats as final proof.
The suggested process could be bilateral, as in the US-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, or, better still, multilateral, as in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. The process would, in turn, be available symmetrically to
Japan as a complainant, a feature that is absent from the US Congress's
favourite weapon: the 301 and Super 301 legislation of the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act of 1988. The chance of such a role reversal would itself
moderate the Clinton administration's enthusiasm for what would otherwise be
one-way demands on Japan.
The Gatt is the right institution because it is based on symmetrical rights
and obligations among its contracting parties. The Gatt has to be Japan's,
and indeed the world's, ultimate defence against managed trade imposed by -
and for the interests of - strong nations.
Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has not, contrary to some
assertions, held up the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. It was the EC's
unwillingness to make agricultural concessions acceptable to the Cairns
Group of agricultural exporting countries that was the main early stumbling
block. At the same time, Japan has not given an energetic push towards
concluding the Round either. Mr Miyazawa should use today's summit to
proclaim that he is willing to compromise on opening rice markets.
Mr Miyazawa should also announce that his strategy would be to close the
Round within the year and immediately have a new Round to pursue unfinished
business, such as the interaction between liberal trade and environmental
protection. On this issue Japan is already at the centre of the stage with
its success at the Rio Earth summit.
Japan should say 'no' to the unreasonable and unwise demands for managed
trade. But it needs also to say 'full speed ahead' to finishing the Round,
to starting a new one and to strengthening the multilateral trading system,
now in severe jeopardy.

FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: GEC is also on British Rail's track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS GADD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter, 'BR should use leasing finance to buy British' (April
13), Mr Hugh Bayley MP says that ABB is the only British company that has
the ability to produce modern aluminium bodied railway carriages.
This is incorrect. GEC Alsthom is currently building aluminium bodied trains
for British Rail. These trains are being supplied to Network SouthEast where
priority is being given to replacing old rolling stock.
GEC Alsthom does not itself manufacture aluminium body shells, which
represent only about 10 per cent of the cost of the trains, preferring to
source these from outside suppliers, including ABB's factory located in Mr
Bayley's York constituency.
If GEC Alsthom secures orders for either InterCity or Network SouthEast
trains, ABB will be given the opportunity to compete for the supply of body
shells and other equipment.
On the other hand, if British Rail asks ABB to supply new trains, GEC
Alsthom will offer to supply traction drives and power supplies which ABB
does not manufacture in the UK.
Like Mr Bayley, I am hopeful that British Rail will soon be allowed to
acquire new rolling stock to help underpin the future of the British Rail
transportation manufacturing industry.

FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: Accomplices to Bosnia massacre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From L HATFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At last a leading political figure has come out publicly saying what
many of us feel ('Thatcher attacks Hurd on Bosnia', April 14). Since the
Bosnian crisis began, more than a year ago, we have seen a totally
pusillanimous lack of response from this government - one excuse after
another to do nothing. Yet to do nothing in the face of the daily
overwhelming evidence of genocide is to be accomplices to this massacre.
To deny people the means to defend themselves is utterly unbelievable. We
have the means to do much, yet we do virtually nothing - and absolutely
nothing that works. Picking up the wounded, maimed and tortured people of
Bosnia after the Serbs have done their worst is not an adequate response. We
have a moral duty to do more, much more. Seldom can there have been such a
blindingly obvious case of right and wrong.
What has this government done? We have a silence from John Major, a vacuous
smile that echoes his total lack of policy across the board and will in this
matter. And we have a foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, whose utterances are
truly disgusting, and a 'defence' secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, who sees
scoring debating points as a substitute for action.

FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD: striking a wrong chord and reluctant to lend

</HEADLINE>

   From C R PEER and M COSTELLO

<TEXT>
Sir, We refer to your timely article drawing attention to the low level of
lending by the EBRD.
Many of our contacts in the Ukraine are convinced that the EBRD does not
really wish to assist the Ukraine to develop its economy. Their conclusions
are based on:
The reluctance of the EBRD to allow this republic to sell the products where
it has a real economic advantage - eg agricultural produce and steel - in
the EC;
The extreme difficulty in obtaining loans from EBRD.
We have already had meetings with the director of two Ukrainian factories
which have had dealings with the EBRD and which feel that the bank has not
given them any assistance. Indeed, in the case of the Black Sea Shipyard in
Nikolaev, according to your article 'Old ways dull the call to a new
Ukraine' (January 5), the EBRD justified its refusal to make loans to the
shipyard on the grounds that Mr Yuri Makarov, the yard's director general,
did not wish to build oil tankers instead of aircraft carriers; this cannot
be true as the yard was already building oil tankers of 45,000 tonne dead
weight and Mr Makarov pointed this out to us on our subsequent visit to his
yard.
It appears that the EBRD is insisting on unrealistic conditions in
particular on total privatisation at breakneck speed, before agreeing to
make loans. If it maintains its present inflexible and bureaucratic
approach, we fear that its overheads will exceed its loans for many years to
come.

<TEXT>
Sir, We have learned to live with many of the excesses of the 'conspicuous
consumption' society over the years, but the latest outbreak at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development strikes a really inappropriate chord
in these difficult times ('Spending at the European Bank', April 13). Such
examples of apparent gross abuse of money supposedly destined for aid and
re-development bring the whole process of international aid and development
into question yet again.
It is particularly sickening for those of us who are conscientiously and
carefully trying to help in the rebuilding of eastern Europe. For example,
for the price of half a marble wall, Ashridge has provided in-depth
management development for more than 200 top and senior managers from Czech
and Slovakian companies and supported them in turning their visions into
practical business plans and actions. The work is funded on a shoestring and
thus, for example, can involve travel across Europe by road in order to save
travel funds. Perhaps in future the bank might like to offer any spare seats
in its executive jet to support development efforts like ours]

   From Mr COLIN STANLEY

<TEXT>
Sir, Your attention-grabbing headline, 'Printers win 3.7 per cent rise'
(April 14), hides the true facts.
Since national negotiations in this industry broke down on February 26, our
member companies have been free to effect their own settlements in line with
their own level of affordability. After six weeks of campaigning by the GPMU
print union, only 20 printing companies have 'settled' at the level of the
union's latest standard claim. There are several thousand other printing
companies where no such settlement has been reached. Indeed, of those
settlements recorded by the federation, more than two-thirds are below the
level of the union's so-called 'minimum terms of settlement'.

FT  16 APR 93 / Bosnia waits for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY President Clinton can stop the Serbs. If the job is impossible, at
least he - and only he - is in a position to try. It is up to the United
States to decide whether the artillery used against women and children in
Srebrenica and elsewhere should be bombed. If - when - it does, its Nato
allies will participate or acquiesce. Even the importunate Russians may do
little more than protest. If a policy of arming the Bosnian Moslems is
agreed in Washington it will not easily pass through the Security Council,
but in the end it too may prevail.
In such circumstances there would be much wringing of hands in London.
Grey-faced emissaries would be sent to Washington. Consider the dangers,
they would cry. A rational response would be: yes, we accept that the
immediate result is likely to be an addition to the Serbs' stores of
munitions. So be it. They are already ample. We understand the exposed
position of British troops who are bravely engaged in escorting the convoys
that distribute food and medical supplies and extricate refugees. Very well,
withdraw the troops. We agree that the medium-term effect might be the
resurgence of Russian hostility towards the west. That is a serious risk.
But the murders are taking place now, on network news, at peak hours. The
possible worst consequence of intervening to stop them may never happen, or
can be faced.
Lady Thatcher is aware of Mr Clinton's dilemma. When she was prime minister
she soothed President Reagan as her task force steamed towards the
Falklands. Two election victories later she strengthened the resolve of
President Bush as he assembled his coalition in the Gulf. Thrown out, she
taunted her successor from the sidelines until he evolved the plan to
provide safe havens for the Kurds. Now, freed from the constraints of
office, she is engaged in a passionate attempt to start a war to end the war
in former Yugoslavia.
She has run her campaign on television - including, for good measure,
breakfast TV in the United States. We cannot yet assess the strength of her
appeal to American public opinion, but a fair assumption is that her clarity
and evident strength of character will have won her at least some converts,
especially in a week in which most of the world has been horrified by TV
pictures of dead, dying and wounded youngsters. As to British opinion, the
evidence is that there was support for her view before she uttered a word;
it can only have increased since she spoke.
Her intervention this week has been magnificent. It has forced us to ask
ourselves, 'where do I stand?' My answer is: 'full of dread, trembling at
unpredictable consequences, but in the end nervously on the side of giving
the Moslems the means with which to defend themselves.' For the former prime
minister is right. We must not accept that no military counterforce can be
deployed when a gang of warriors, acting in the name of national identity,
commits every atrocity, every slaughter, in order to gain lebensraum on
European soil. If we do, we are nothing.
It should be admitted at once that there is compromise and perhaps
self-delusion in this stance just as there is falsity in the British
government's pretence that a 'tightening noose' of sanctions will force
Serbia to accept the Vance-Owen plan. For there is no serious call anywhere
 -not in the White House, not in Lady Thatcher's message, certainly not in
Downing Street - for the deployment of active British or French or American
troops on the ground. We may give the Bosnian Muslims the arms they need and
we may risk our pilots in air strikes, but that, rightly, is as far as we
are prepared to go.
It is for this reason that we should consider the 'do nothing' option before
rejecting it. The case runs like this: short of a huge expenditure of
outsiders' lives there is no power on earth that will prevent the Serbians
from winning. There is no justification for piling up body-bags containing
west European and American young men and women by taking one side in an
ancient Balkan conflict. Such wars occur all over the world. They always
have and always will. The greatest saving in human life will be achieved by
standing aside and allowing the natural victors to achieve their ambitions
in the swiftest possible manner.
That case was best put when hostilities first broke out. If there were to be
injustices then, they would at least be the consequence of actions by the
parties directly involved. The case was weakened when, at German insistence,
Croatia was recognised. It was further diminished when, driven by public
opinion, the arms embargo was imposed. That favoured Serbia, which commands
the great bulk of the former Yugoslavian military force, plus equipment. The
'do nothing' argument was finally destroyed by the 'humanitarian aid'
initiative, which assigned the task of assistant-in-chief to ethnic
cleansing to the United Nations.
The initial American response, which was to regard the entire conflict as a
European responsibility, allowed the European Community to blunder in,
wreaking almost as much havoc with its unenforceable good intentions as the
former Yugoslavs managed to create on their own. We outsiders are already
involved. It is too late to pack up and go home.
This is not to say that Mr John Major's approach is, as Lady Thatcher
implies, contemptible. The prime minister and the foreign secretary are
painfully conscious of their responsibility for the safety of British
troops. A parable retailed to me at second hand has Sir Peter Harding, the
chief of the defence staff, warning the Cabinet of the logistical
difficulties of sending troops to the Balkans. Mr Major is said to have
leaned back and remarked 'you have thrown a grenade in my lap.' I cannot
vouch for the anecdote, but its spirit reflects the prime minister's
legitimate and understandable concerns.
Lady Thatcher would not have responded thus. So what? A petty squabble
between the present and former leaders of the British Conservative party is
insignificant when set against the screaming emergency in Bosnia. Mr Major
is doing the job he is cut out to do. That does not embrace leadership of
the Nato alliance or the western world. For such a task it is necessary to
catch the public mood, or correct it. It is up to Mr Clinton to pick up the
challenge, or deflect it with better arguments than have yet been put.

FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: 'Guaranteed' means one thing and one thing only
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In her article 'Guarantees: are they worthless?' (Finance and the
Family, April 3), Scheherazade Daneshkhu looked at building society
'promises' and concluded that many were either worthless or meaningless.
The loose manner in which 'guaranteed' has been scattered about financial
advertising has also given us some concern here at National Savings. We
pride ourselves that we pioneered non-risk, guaranteed rate products when we
introduced National Savings certificates as far back as 1916. Ever since
then we have used the word 'guaranteed' to mean one thing and one thing only
 -interest rates fixed and unchangeable for a specified period of time.
This is how we apply it in relation not only to savings certificates, but
also capital bonds, children's bonus bonds, yearly plan and the recently
revived first option bond.
The use of the term to mean a rate differential above another variable rate
account (usually paying very low interest) is, in our view, a debasement of
the language of finance.
Its use in relation to products where the interest rate is fixed but the
capital is not guaranteed is also disturbing. The various different meanings
assigned to the term can only serve to confuse and may actually mislead
savers, who may be bewildered enough already as the institutions play
musical chairs with their products.
National Savings will continue to use the term 'guaranteed' in the single
sense of rates which are fixed for at least a year. We believe that other
institutions would be doing a service to the public if they were to
standardise their own usage to mean fixed rates offered on capitally secure
products for a set period of time.

Someone should write a PhD on connections between the age of television
staff and the subject matter of comedies. In the 1960s when television was
full of young people there were lots of comedies about young people sharing
flats. As the broadcasters matured the popular subject became young families
with children. Now, with a log-jam of 50-somethings in television, series
are about dealing with senile parents, grown up children, and marriage
breakdown. Whether ITV's new comedy, Conjugal Rites, fits into this pattern
we shall see. We are told it is about a couple's struggle to stay together
after 21 years of marriage. Gwen Taylor and Michael Williams play the
husband and wife (8.00). Anglia's police series The Chief deservedly gets
another series. In the first batch Tim Piggott-Smith played, not a detective
up against city hall, but a chief constable up against the conservative
Establishment. At the start of the new series (9.00 ITV) he is about to
accept a post with Europol in Brussels. Also starting another run is BBC2's
Have I Got News For You, an idea pinched from Radio 4's 'News Quiz'(10.00
BBC2).

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: 'Real Time' from Israel -  Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tmu-Na Theatre of Israel has arrived in Hammersmith and confirms the
company's reputation for passionate intensity. The acting is also full of
conviction. If you want to see writhing bodies against a musical background
in a bar in Tel Aviv on the eve of the Yom Kippur war, here is the
opportunity.
You may see something else besides: an excellent company groping for a play.
Possibly one is too far outside the culture to appreciate them, in which
case I apologise. I saw some wonderful productions in Israel last year, but
my impression even then was that the Israelis have developed a talent for
acting and directing without producing the scripts to match. It was
explained to me that the Israeli theatre suffers from self-censorship: it is
unable to write directly about contemporary questions, such as relations
between Jews and Arabs and what is happening on the West Bank. What it can
just about do is to write about relations between Israelis: newcomers and
old hands.
Real Time has a shot in that direction. Almost the first line is the best.
'I didn't talk for a year after I came to Israel,' says a Russian immigrant
working as the caretaker of Eva's Bar. He was afraid of saying the wrong
thing, making mistakes in the language or generally being misunderstood.
'All countries hate foreigners,' he adds.
The rest never lives up to that. The fact that it is set on the eve of the
Yom Kippur war is about as trite as another play on the night that Kennedy
died: more nostalgia than comment. There is a lot of quite attractive sexual
sleaze: four women to two slightly decrepit men. Some of it takes place on
and around a lavatory bowl, prominently set backstage centre. One wondered
why. If it is satire, it is heavily coded. It looks like outmoded
trendiness.
Tmu-Na is Hebrew for images in motion. The company was founded in 1982 by
Nava Zukerman who wrote and co-directs Real Time. If the company had a real
play, it could be terrific.

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Ohana and Dutilleux - Wigmore Hall recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Roberts's latest London piano recital, at the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday,
was given in memory of the composer Maurice Ohana, who died last year at the
age of 78. The tribute was richly deserved.
Born in Casablanca of Andalucian ancestry, a British passport-holder (his
father had once been resident in Gibraltar) who spent his adult life in
France, Ohana produced a mature compositional voice which, while not
disguising the marks of his exotic upbringing nor denying the potent
influences of Debussy and Falla, remained singularly and fascinatingly his
own. The New Grove calls him a 'fiercely independent figure' - rightly so,
since he steered rigorously clear of the cliques and fashions that dominated
French music in the postwar period and yet managed never to fall prey to
backwater obsessiveness, smallness of vision, or eccentricity.
Roberts, a noted Debussyan who became Ohana's favoured pianist in the last
decade of his life, played here six of the Etudes d'interpretation that
Ohana wrote for him. Each of these is brilliantly written to exploit - as
are Debussy's late Etudes, the obvious starting-point - a particular facet
of pianistic technique; each transports the listener into a world of
Mediterranean air, light and artistic perception, clean, sensually
unabashed, on occasion bracingly harsh.
Melodic lines emerge sharply profiled, often curlicued with the ornate
tracery of North African cantillation or Andalucian folk song. (In the most
striking Study of Roberts's selection, 'Main gauche seul', a sinuously
weaving line for the left hand preserves its independence through all manner
of decorative impositions.) There is a constant sense of Ohana's hard-edged,
non-European, sometimes jazzy vitality extending and developing the Debussy
pianistic canvas.
Roberts, a superbly under-the skin interpreter of these pieces, also played
selections of Debussy, including glittering yet firmly ordered performances
of three Studies, and a bold one of Falla's magnificent Fantasia baetica.
The programme was satisfying both in parts and as a whole, above all because
of the intelligence and precise sense of style with which it was delivered.
Another distinctive senior figure of French music, Henri Dutilleux (b.
1916), figured in the recital of the Ysaye Quartet at the Wigmore the
following evening. His 1977 string quartet - subtitled 'Ainsi la nuit', a
short (17 minutes), tightly packed piece - speaks the languages of Bartok
and Webern yet with a highly 'personal' mode of utterance.
Minute cells, flourishes pile up; the virtuosity of the string writing is
remarkable both for its firmness of purpose and for its lack of ostentation.
The young French quartet, who since their victory in the 1988 Evian
competition have picked up an international career and a Decca recording
contract, played 'Ainsi la nuit' with a devotion sadly missing in their
brusque, jerky accounts of Haydn (Op. 74 no. 1) and Beethoven (the F minor,
Op. 95) earlier in the concert. Even their Mendelssohn A minor, more suavely
disciplined, seemed oddly airless and unloving.
The Ysaye Quartet concert was sponsored by Banque Paribas

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Wilde's 'Happy Prince' to music - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900) also wrote short stories.
The Happy Prince is the subject of an enchanting musical at the Old Fire
Station, Oxford. A cast of four, a small band, minimal scenery, it is the
quintessence of Wilde's apercu that art should aim to conceal the artist
while revealing itself. It makes a fine evening: no sex, no violence, no
reality.
Sue Casson's light score loosely follows Wilde's story. A statue prince and
a migrating swallow help relieve the poverty of a town outside a regal
palace; the swallow distributes fragments of gold and gems from the statue,
pecks out its sapphire eyes to give away, and the two fall in love as the
swallow freezes to death in winter. Wilde left the moral open.
The musical flickers between Wilde's fable and musical-verite, of the City
of Angels type, where the show draws attention to its own construction. The
first number, 'Warm-Up', and the later 'The Tricks of the Trade' are about
theatrical illusion; and since Wilde has been modernised, there are sharp
contemporary jokes, including Dorothy Parker's line about running the whole
gamut of emotions from A to B.
Director Tom Blackmore and the cast (John Herriman, Mina Anwar, Andrew
Bolton, Sue Casson) produce strong performances, but the voices sometimes
fail to meet the demands of Casson's wordy, witty score. The finest numbers
are the lulling 'Twilight City' where the swallow circles down en route to
warmer climes, and the beautiful soaring 'Swallow's Lament' duet between the
statue and the bird. Act two opens with a superb 'The Crowd Scene' which
peoples the theatre musically rather than bodily, four different melodies
making the stage teem with life.

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Ian McQueen's 'Fortunato' - Opera in Scandinavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian McQueen, though celebrated in Sweden, remains a relatively little known
composer in his native Britain. Born in Glasgow in 1954, he studied at the
Royal College of Music, then with Maxwell Davies and in Denmark, where his
Scandinavian connections began, with Per Norgard. He wrote a one-act opera -
Judit och Holofernes - for the season at Vadstena Castle, Sweden, in 1987.
The success of this hard-hitting but lyrical piece led to a commission for a
three-act opera in Swedish from Norrlandsoperan. Several years in gestation,
Fortunato is now completing a triumphant run of (21) premiere performances
at the converted fire-station in Umea which houses this most northerly of
opera companies and one of the most enterprising.
Umea is a medium-sized university and medical town (average age, 35) that
culturally serves an area extending up to and beyond the Arctic Circle. That
it has an opera company at all, never mind one that commissions new work
from foreigners, is due firstly to a central government decision of 1974 to
spread artistic goodness to the regions. But Umea's specific success is the
boldly imaginative spirit of its successive chiefs, Arnold Ostman and, since
1988, Per-Erik Ohrn.
Ohrn receives a total of Pounds 3.6m in central, regional and civic
subsidies, with which he stages two major productions a year and undertakes
a substantial amount of touring. An all-round man of the opera-theatre he
has pursued enlightened creative aims, and no-one could be less provincial
in attitude. British directors such as Clare Venables (Figaro) and Matthew
Richardson (Midsummer Night's Dream) have worked at Umea. Richardson returns
as Fortunato's director; its designer, Jon Morrell, is also British; its
conductor, Gary Berkson, is American; and its librettist, Vanda
Monaco-Westerhal, Italian.
Ohrn's current ambition is to expand Norrlandsoperan into a four-town
federation along the lines of Opera du Rhin in Alsace, thus engendering an
annual total of eight new productions for the region, which would be swapped
around. Meanwhile, activity is concentrated inside the metal-fronted,
unpretty but versatile Umea building, with its shoebox auditorium seating
250 and its single admission price of Pounds 20.
At the performance of Fortunato which I attended the house was full, the
average age half that of the town, and the final acclamation was
overwhelming. Foreigners though they be, McQueen with his music and
Monaco-Westerhal with her story and text have evidently found a way of
speaking to their Swedish audiences with vibrant directness. So much so that
the critic of one national newspaper has pleaded for this work to be chosen
to open the new opera house in Gothenberg. The story, with its Peer
Gynt-like protagonist and his picaresque experiences in a medieval world of
sleaze, violence and opportunism has a message no doubt for the Sweden of
today; but it is a thoroughly archetypal brew, susceptible of any number of
interpretations, religious, sexual, political.
Both creators have been able to sustain their epic - their 'comedy beset
with tragedy' - without narrowing its focus to specific issues but without
ever losing our interest. Fortunato is, in short, a true work of art, at
once ambiguous and inevitable-seeming. McQueen's musical language blossoms
here as never before. He is a composer who has survived early exposure to
ravaging post-war stylistic complexity and achieved a most personal and
mettled directness of utterance. His manner is eclectic but not essentially
allusive: he uses a great variety of means, from the tonal to the
electronic, but only in order to say what he has to say, never in a spirit
of irony or cultural tourism. Even when he writes for Handelian coloratura
soprano, it is with the purpose of thus expressing the icy detachment of a
mysterious 'Woman on the Mountain' (Monica Sjoholm,) not to provide a
parodistic knees-up.
This and most of the other solo lines are sensitively devised for the voice.
His ensembles, of which there is a generous supply, are richly textured; the
tutti finales of the first two acts have an astonishing sureness of touch, a
genuinely cumulative power. His choral writing is zestful and catchy. But it
is his orchestral writing that marks out the opera's high points: the
extraordinary declamation for unison high violins which accompanies
conscience-stricken Fortunato (confined by Richardson in a coffin-sized box)
at the outset of Act 2; the wordless love duet for the semi-supernatural
couple Voland and Mariella, which has the frankness of a pop-song and the
lyrical afflatus of later Tippett.
If the creative team was foreign, the singing strength was powerfully
Swedish. The remarkable Mikael Bellini in the title role had an easy vigour
which intimated a whole new world of operatic naturalness for the
counter-tenor voice. Mezzo Carina Strandberg gave us a sumptuously
impassioned Mariella. Baritone Peter Mattei's Voland was simply bursting
with vocal vitality and stage presence. Morrell's endlessly adaptable stony
box-set was admirable and Richardson's direction signally assured. Berkson
conducted a performance that was all fluidity, confidence, and glowing
happiness. Fortunato simply has to be staged in Britain.

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Royal views of Windsor Castle - Susan Moore reviews
the work of Thomas and Paul Sandby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the major consequences of the Queen's 'annus horribilis' has been an
increase in public debate abut the Royal Collection. The ill-informed have
been tempted to speculate that the Queen might start selling off works of
art to pay the tax man. Yet a splendid if unassuming exhibition at Windsor
comes as a timely reminder that the collection is growing, albeit modestly.
Since the number of paintings, drawings and watercolours is an awesome
10,000, 20,000 and 30,000 respectively, some say that the collection is big
enough, while others press for contemporary acquisitions. As it happens,
portraits of the current holders of the Order of Merit are in the process of
being commissioned, and recent additions to the already rich holding of
Sandby drawings of Windsor represent a special case.
Amid the throng of tourists gripped by the Changing of the Guard and the
burnt-out shells of rooms ravaged by the recent fire, the new drawings
gallery is a haven of tranquility. It has been formed out of a Georgian
Gothick lobby that led to the Grand Staircase before Wyattville remodelled
the castle for William IV. A gallery has been there since the 1960s, but it
has been transformed by the designs of Alec Cobbe into an environment that
is both intimate and grand. Drawings are shown to striking advantage on
Gothic screens against dark burgundy damask.
As a topographical draughtsman to the Duke of Cumberland, and then Deputy
Ranger of Windsor Great Park, Thomas Sandby was resident at Windsor for much
of his life. His views of the castle and its environs, along with those made
by or in collaboration with his younger brother Paul, constitute an
unparallelled record of Windsor and the development of the Great Park in the
second half of the 18th century.
Grand, showy gouaches by Paul open the show. Three out of the four are
relatively recent acquisitions and, given their fragile condition, may never
be exhibited elsewhere. The clarity of light and artfully casual
distribution of figures in his delightful 'The North Terrace looking east',
suggest why Canaletto should have been so readily collected by the British -
and bring to mind the gouaches of his fellow Venetian Marco Ricci.
Thereafter, we move between Paul and Thomas, and sheets that can only be
read as a combination of their talents. Few works are signed and even
signatures need not always tell the whole truth, but it seems reasonably
clear that the most ravishing of all the sheets, those carefully
pencil-drawn and subtlely washed prospects of the castle and the untroubled
landscape beyond, are the work of Thomas. Their meticulous mapping of every
tree, field, turn in the Thames - almost every roof tile - mark them out as
the productions of the trained military topographer who was to become the
first Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts. In one
masterly panorama, a sign undecipherable to the naked eye offers 'Coffie and
Tea' in the old guardroom.
Figures appear to have been largely Paul's responsibility. Here are one or
two larger-scale studies of the personalities found in the Duke of
Cumberland's household in the 1750s. Thus we find Bob Dun, one of the Duke's
gardeners, 'a most facetious fellow', Voules the bailiff, the steward and an
un-named negro servant. More usually, however, the figures are simply
staffage, there to be busy in the Moat Garden wielding watering cans or to
stand guard in immaculate and picturesque uniforms.
Even in this small selection, numbering a slim 28 sheets and representing
perhaps a tenth of the collection, there is considerable evidence of
unevenness. Thomas is seen to best advantage in a series of masterly
panoramas, and more modestly at work designing various rustic structures
like the root house and the rockwork bridge for the Great Park. Paul is
shown capable of bravura gouaches but also of a coarseness of touch which is
even more pronounced beside the precision and delicacy of Thomas.
It is not easy to judge this show purely on its artistic merits, or on its
historical interest. It is impossible not to be seduced by what comes across
as a cloudless golden age before the castle was troubled by the Heathrow
flight path and the bad weather John Piper found there during the war.
One note of high drama reminds us of the present more than the past: Paul's
spectacular watercolour and gouache of 'Windsor Castle on a Rejoicing
Night'. Shooting fireworks confected out of flecks of gold paint light up
the night sky and a massive gold and pink-tinged bonfire ominously
silhouettes the Winchester Tower and sends out billowing black smoke. And
the presence of a drunken man being half-carried away from the revelry
suggests that Saturday nights have not really changed all that much.
The exhibition continues at Windsor Castle until October 3

FT  16 APR 93 / The Property Market: Farmers' barren landscape - The
long-term outlook for agricultural land values remain uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have Agricultural land prices in the UK hit bottom? After three dismal
years, some agents believe the land market is set for a tentative recovery.
'The feeling is that we are at a turning point,' says Mr Jim Ward, head of
research at Savills, the chartered surveyors.
Farm values have dropped by as much as 50 per cent in real terms since their
1980s peak but as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says, 'there
are signs that the recent decline in farm values is coming to an end, as
lower interest rates relieve the burden on hard-pressed farmers.'
Any recovery will be from a low base. Values are at their lowest for a
decade and, in real terms, at their lowest for 30 years. But the decline has
been far from steady: agricultural land has been a particularly volatile
sector of the property market.
In the 1970s, land values rose steeply as a result of a large increase in
farm profitability, stemming from increased production yields and higher EC
support for farm prices. Land values were forced up by greater demand for
land from financial institutions, largely in the belief that property was a
good hedge against inflation.
But by the early 1980s, the EC's Common Agricultural Policy was producing
food mountains - and a constant stream of criticism. Brussels instigated
reforms in an effort to control production and curb costs, leading to
progressive cuts in the prices of farm produce. The resulting constraints on
farm income, coupled with lower inflation, sharply reduced potential
investors' appetite for land.
This decline in demand for land was briefly reversed in 1988, when land
values shared in the general inflation of asset prices. Values were boosted
by new investors who relished the prospect of life in the country. Prices
paid for residential farms in the south and west of England rose by 40 per
cent between 1987 and 1989.
But once recession took hold in 1989, drying up the supply of new
investment, prices began to nosedive. At first, this decline was reinforced
by further pressure on farm incomes. But in 1991, there was a modest
improvement in incomes; the Ministry of Agriculture calculates that in 1991
farm incomes rose by 1.1 per cent, a drastic revision of its earlier
estimate that incomes had fallen by 14 per cent to their lowest level since
1945.
Farmers' fortunes again improved last year. Poor weather, uncertainty about
CAP reforms and the stalled talks on liberalising world trade under the Gatt
Uruguay Round resulted in a mood of despondency among farmers.
The gloom was, in part, ill-founded. Farmers' incomes rose by 23.6 per cent
as a result of a devaluation of the 'green pound' - the currency used in EC
farm trade - following the UK's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism in September and the subsequent easing of British interest rates.
A lower interest burden transformed the profitability of many farms.
But the respite may be temporary. The agricultural land market is still in
the throes of immense uncertainty and change. The benefits from the
devaluation will be eroded in the next few years as inflationary pressures
on imports drive up costs.
Longer term, there is concern about the level of subsidies to farmers. The
set-aside scheme introduced last year by the EC (designed to take 1.5m acres
of farmland out of production, an area slightly larger than Lincolnshire)
involves large subsidies to compensate farmers. In the long term, some
farmers are concerned about how long this official support can be sustained.
The future of farming subsidies is a complex issue concerning EC policy,
international trade negotiations and public finances. Any possibility of
withdrawing support creates alarm in the farming lobby, which argues that
falling prices could make farming uneconomic in some areas and lead to its
abandonment over large parts of the country.
'Agriculture cannot be turned on and off like a tap,' says the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Once farming has been run down and
farmland abandoned, it would be difficult to reverse the situation in the
event of an upswing in demand.'
But critics of the set-aside subsidy believe that falling land values would
merely cause temporary hardship while the removal of subsidies could lead to
less intensive and more environmentally-friendly farming. Cheaper land would
reduce farmers' needs for such high returns, according to the Council for
Protection of Rural England.
Likewise, Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, argues that
the real problem is not a surplus of land but rather that land is farmed too
intensively.
Friends of the Earth is opposed to taking land out of production because of
uncertainty about climatic change, the possibility of a national emergency,
and the likelihood that intensive methods of production may be severely
eroding topsoil and contaminating ground water. 'We do not believe we should
be relaxing strategic reserve of land in the UK,' says Mr Robin Maynard,
countryside campaigner for FoE.
Conservationists are also concerned about the alternative uses to which land
is put once taken out of production. They are fearful that allowing more
development in the countryside would create a knock-on demand for new roads,
housing and shops.
But others believe that agricultural land can be put to better use. 'Are we
right to agonise over every last acre of rural land when, after the CAP
reform package is implemented, so much will lay idle?' asked Mr Christopher
Jonas, president of RICS in a speech in the House of Lords in December. Mr
Jonas criticised the 'almost pathological fear of development in the
countryside.
'All evidence points to the fact that most of us would prefer to work in a
more rural environment. With improved transport links and new technology,
this is increasingly practicable,' he said. The trend is to permit more uses
for agricultural land as businesses and people move to the countryside. This
view won official support early last year when the government told local
authorities that 'little weight need normally be given' to the loss of farm
land of moderate or poor quality - which makes up two-thirds of Britain's
agriculture land - when councils draw up their development blueprints.
The government's attitude to development in the countryside shows that the
value of agricultural land is not wholly dependent on the state of the
agricultural industry. This, together with brighter prospects for farm
profits over the next few years, might give some support to land values.
But hopes of a revival are tentative. And looking ahead, there is immense
uncertainty about the prospects for rural land values.

FT  16 APR 93 / Technology: How to disable a virus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers in the UK unveiled a new approach to vaccination at a medical
conference in the US last month.
The scientists from Cambridge and Sheffield Universities and Cantab, a
Cambridge biotechnology company, have discovered how to disable a virus in
such a way that it can activate a full immune response but not spread within
its host.
The DISC (Disabled Infectious Single Cycle) approach is being developed
first for herpes. By deleting one gene (for glycoprotein H) the scientists
have created a virus which is capable of only one complete round of
replication but which looks normal to the host cells.
Animal studies show that the DISC herpes virus can protect successfully
against infection. It induces protective immunity much more effectively than
vaccination with conventional inactivated virus.
Now Cantab plans to move on to human clinical trials, probably starting next
year.
Alan Munro, Cantab research director, says the company wants to produce a
vaccine against HSV-2, the virus that causes genital herpes. It could
prevent infection in the first place or it could stop the symptoms recurring
in people who had already become infected.
Although there are competing technologies for making vaccines by disabling
or attenuating viruses, the Cantab scientists believe DISC gives the fullest
range of immune responses - and therefore the best protection against
infection.
In principle, it should be possible to extend the DISC approach to vaccines
against other viruses.
'We're thinking about other potential targets,' Munro says.
'Selecting targets is always a combination of assessing clinical need and
technical feasibility.
'Unfortunately the technical problems with the viruses where the need is
greatest, such as HIV, are quite substantial.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Management: An antidote to high health costs - Increased
claims are the latest threat to insurers battling to contain medical bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cost increases are the biggest potential killer of private healthcare in
Britain. Controlling them is now as important an issue for private health
insurance managers as generating new business. But just as the insurers were
congratulating themselves on their progress in containing hospital costs
another problem has arisen.
'Cost increases are not now being driven by rises in healthcare prices, but
by the increased frequency with which insured people are having treatment,'
explains Arthur Large, managing director in charge of membership at Bupa,
the biggest private healthcare group. Last year Bupa's average claim costs
rose by 9.6 per cent - 7.2 per cent resulting from an increased frequency of
claims.
The latest trend is in contrast with the recent improvement which has been
made in curtailing actual medical bills. Recent tough negotiations with
hospital operators have begun to pay off. Innovations such as procedure
pricing - hospitals agreeing to perform all operations of a particular type,
such as hip replacements, at a single set price - have broken the
traditional pattern of medical costs rising faster than general inflation.
Roy Forman, managing director of Private Patients Plan, the second biggest
medical insurer, said when announcing his annual results last month that PPP
had 'made more progress in the important area of claims cost management last
year than we did in the whole of the previous decade.'
The striking growth in claims has many possible explanations, not all
directly clinical. People with private medical insurance sometimes still use
the National Health Service for routine treatment; this seems to be
happening less, however, after several years of publicity about waiting
lists and funding problems in the public sector.
Fundholding GPs, who finance their patients' NHS care from overall set
budgets, have an incentive to encourage individuals with private health
insurance to use it. Last year's sharp growth in claims will have included
some employees who feared redundancy and sought treatment while still
members of their employers' schemes.
Despite these factors, though, Bupa managed to reverse the industry trend in
its corporate business sector - covering bigger companies - where the
frequency of claims showed a slight fall.
The stabilising of corporate claims reflects attempts by Bupa to persuade
client companies to manage healthcare schemes more actively. Companies are
advised to appoint a specific manager to administer schemes and handle
employees' claims. They are urged to consider levying excess charges on
employees - people may think twice about opting for treatment if they have
to pay part of the cost themselves.
Bupa has now advanced from this package of common sense advice to a more
sophisticated Care Support Service for corporate clients and their
employees. It offers Bupa a hope of managing costs by discussing possible
options with patients before treatment begins.
Employees of companies in the Care Support scheme telephone a helpline
staffed by Bupa nurses once they have been referred to consultants by their
GPs. This gives Bupa the option, in appropriate cases, of suggesting that
patients consider day-case surgery, one of the biggest cost-saving measures
currently available in hospitals. Day-case surgery saves around 30 per cent
on typical costs by avoiding the need to keep patients in hospital beds
overnight.
Hospital accommodation and nursing charges amount to more than 40 per cent
of total insurance claims - a night in a private hospital room will usually
cost between Pounds 180 and Pounds 280. When an in-patient stay is necessary
Bupa nurses will, with patients' permission, discuss home-care needs with
their consultants and organise nursing and domestic support to meet them.
Around one-third of large companies insured by Bupa are already enrolled in
Care Support. It treads delicate ground - Large and his colleagues know
patients want to be sure decisions about treatment are made on medical
grounds, rather than to meet the cost-control desires of an insurance
company. To help provide reassurance, the scheme contains provision for a
second specialist opinion for patients undergoing surgery.
But there are prospects of schemes such as Care Support turning everyone
into winners. Health managers like day surgery because it is cheaper.
Companies will like it if it helps keep premium increases down (premium
increases for Bupa's company schemes have been 7 per cent during the past
year - half the level of increase for individual customers). Patients like
it because it avoids having to stay in hospital unnecessarily. And many
doctors say that, for appropriate procedures, day surgery results are better
those of conventional methods.

With increasing environmental pressures on the motor car, engine makers are
trying to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine while
reducing emissions.
Ricardo Consulting Engineers, the engine and transmission specialist, has
developed a combustion system for engines which, it claims, reduces fuel
consumption by up to 12 per cent while radically reducing the levels of
waste oxides of nitrogen.
The CCVS (combustion control by vortex stratification) system recycles inert
exhaust gases back into the system. Previously, exhaust gas recirculation
resulted in an increase of emitted hydrocarbons and high fuel consumption.
CCVS keeps the waste gases separate from the fuel and air mix, which means
the air and fuel burn cleanly. Ricardo: UK, 0273 455611.

A method of turning sludge from sewage treatment plants into agricultural
compost has been developed by the French company Leas, of Saint-Ismier.
The first phase of the process is to extract the sludge and remove most of
the water and then add this to bark, sawdust and household waste to improve
the consistency and increase the proportion of carbon. Air is then
circulated through the mixture to create oxidation so that the organic
matter breaks down. The mixing and oxidation process is computer-controlled
and can be remotely monitored using a modem and telephone line. Leas:

removing a trace of the liquor and mixing it with the antibodies it is
possible to tell if the drink has been tampered with. Biocode: UK, 0904

FT  16 APR 93 / Management: Banking on satisfaction - How Lloyds is trying
to improve service standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you telephone a branch of Lloyds Bank and it rings five times before
there is a reply; if the person who answers does not introduce him or
herself by name during the conversation; if you are standing in a queue with
more people in it than the number of open tills, then something is wrong.
If any of these things happen, then the branch is breaching standards of
customer service set by the bank since last July. The idea of a British bank
having such mechanistic measures of customer service is far from
traditional. Yet Lloyds feels it has little choice but to change its ways.
As banks try to devise new charges to raise income from customers, they are
confronted with increasing alienation. An internal survey at Lloyds found
that while 73 per cent of bank customers were happy with their bank in 1987,
the figure had dropped to 61 per cent by last year. This is a dangerous
trend because many banks have invested in subsidiaries such as life
insurance operations companies to try to sell more to their customers. 'It
is a truism that you can only sell to a customer who is satisfied with the
service he is getting,' says Clive Kenyon of Lloyds.
Kenyon is trying to ensure customers are more satisfied with Lloyds than in
the past. He is in charge of the 'service challenge', which was launched in
the bank's 1,888 branches last summer after being tested in 55 branches in
1990. The initiative will be developed throughout this year.
The reasoning behind it is simple. The bank hopes to raise the level of
service by setting 'core' standards every branch must meet and supplementing
them with local targets. These standards are being measured by a range of
methods including customer surveys and staff questionnaires.
Kenyon argues that Lloyds underestimated the impact of poor service before
because it could not measure service as easily as the loan mistakes that
appear as debt provisions in annual accounts. 'A bad loan is a very obvious
cost, but a mistake in a pamphlet can be just as damaging,' he says.
The emphasis on measurement means the bank's new standards are deliberately
unexotic. Things such as the speed at which calls are answered can be
quantified fairly easily. 'We just want to encourage polite, efficient
service,' says Kenyon.
The bank has tried to encourage participation from staff by allowing groups
of employees working in teams in branches to set their own additional
standards. 'They can choose, but it has to be something that has an impact
on customers, not just watering the plants twice a day,' he says.
Lloyds already has evidence of the impact. Customers were more satisfied
with pilot branches in 1991 than with others. Furthermore, since the
initiative was launched nationally in the summer, average satisfaction with
branch service has risen five points on a 100-point scale to 81 points.
The bank is monitoring the impact using four methods, two of which are
customer surveys. There is a 'first impressions' survey of all new
customers. There is also a general survey carried out every six months which
seeks the views of a weighted sample of 350 customers per branch.
The other two methods are more eclectic. A survey company telephones each
branch anonymously twice a month to test how staff respond to inquiries
about products. Finally, a quarter of each branch's staff answer a monthly
questionnaire about the bank's products to test their knowledge.
Kenyon says this is not intended to create competition among branches. But
it is watching branches that underperform, helped by 24 managers who monitor
the initiative. It is not only angry customers who are keeping Lloyds' staff
under closer scrutiny than ever before.

FT  16 APR 93 / Technology: Chasing the current - A new engine that
outperforms standard induction motors across the board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be no tougher challenge for inventors than to break into an
industrial market with established players worldwide and a mature product
that has been refined and improved over many years of development.
It is hard enough persuading manufacturers that your invention both works,
and works better than the existing product, says Peter Lawrenson. But
getting them to change their product line is even harder.
Lawrenson is founder, chairman and chief executive of Switched Reluctance
Drives, a small Leeds-based company which is trying to penetrate one of the
oldest and most mature product sectors in engineering - electric motors.
Over the past 25 years, Lawrenson and his team have had an uphill battle
convincing the electric motor industry that the so-called switched
reluctance (SR) motor can outperform standard induction motors across the
board - in efficiency, speed, torque, reliability and robustness.
Now, after spending Pounds 35m, an academic idea has been turned into a
business whose managers can begin to foresee - through licensing, joint
ventures and other deals - the taking of substantial shares in several parts
of the world electric motor market, worth Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn (Pounds
20bn-Pounds 26bn) a year in total.
'There are several areas where SR drives could get a 20 per cent market
share,' says Lawrenson. 'Ultimately, when SR drives are totally established,
the share could be as high as 50 per cent.'
Standard electric motors work through the inter-relationship of two magnetic
fields generated by electric current passing through coils in the rotor
(rotating part) and stator (static part) of the motor.
An SR drive, too, has a rotor and a stator, but the rotor is, effectively, a
solid piece of iron - it is made of a large number of laminations of iron -
and does not carry a current.
The idea, says Lawrenson, is to exploit the fact that the forces from a
magnetic field on the iron in the rotor can be many times greater than those
on currents. Unfortunately, though, they can normally be used only for a
short movement, and then stop.
The SR drive makes these forces continuous by switching the current in the
stator on and off - ensuring the poles on the rotor are continually
'chasing' the current. Controlling this process requires semiconductors,
which means that for the first time electronic control is inherent in an
electric motor rather than auxiliary to it.
The result is a motor that, size for size, produces up to three times as
much power as a standard AC or DC motor. Duty for duty, the SR motor costs
half as much to manufacture as its standard rivals, due mainly to the much
simpler rotor, yet uses conventional materials and the same manufacturing
processes - just fewer of them.
It is the falling price of semiconductors - coupled with rising prices for
copper, iron and labour - that is increasingly making SR drives a commercial
proposition, says Lawrenson.
'Until the last year or two,' he says, 'the semiconductors would cost three
times as much as the motors, and that didn't add up.
'So we had to get the semiconductor companies to realise that we were
offering them potentially the largest market they ever had - through
automotive auxiliaries (generators, windscreen wipers etc) and household
appliances.'
Now, in a typical application such as a washing machine, an SR motor would
cost Pounds 16 in total - Pounds 8 each for the motor and the electronics -
against Pounds 16 for a conventional motor and Pounds 2 for its associated
electronics.
SR Drives has spent the past 25 years building up its knowledge of the new
type of motor and has become the acknowledged world leader in all aspects of
the technology, manufacturing and commercial exploitation of SR drives.
Having initially believed that the motor would work best at smaller power
outputs, the company has discovered that there is no theoretical upper size
limit. It has successfully developed motors at sizes approaching 1MW, and
has paper designs for motors of 5-10MW, big enough to power a locomotive.
The company decided some years ago that licensing was the best approach to
exploiting the technology, but has found that the electric motor industry's
customers in a wide range of businesses from washing machines and mining
equipment to aerospace pumps and compressors have been more receptive than
the motor producers themselves.
Some of the latter, says Lawrenson, have considered the SR drive to be
'ivory tower rhubarb' and seem also to have found the prospect of switching
to SR drives too disturbing psychologically.
In Europe, four companies are producing SR drives for general industrial
uses, under licence from the Leeds company, and Sole, a subsidiary of
Zanussi, is expected to be producing an SR motor for white goods within two
years. In Sweden, Besam, one of the world's leading automatic door
producers, is using SR motors - their high torque eliminates the need for a
gearbox and thus saves space.
Now Lawrenson is considering taking SR Drives into manufacturing. It already
sources key electronic components for its licensees and may within a year or
so begin producing one or two motors on a modest scale.
Two leading US companies, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard, are using SR
drives independently of the Leeds company in some of their products.
Lawrenson takes their involvement as a compliment: 'We don't mind, it
authenticates all that we've been saying for the past 20 years.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Management: An organised US alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surging health care costs have forced some US companies, such as Glazer
Steel in New Orleans, to drop health insurance benefits altogether. But
eliminating the perk is not easy. Most unions demand healthcare packages for
workers as part of labour deals; failing to offer them can put non-union
companies at a severe disadvantage when competing for talented personnel.
Soon, eliminating employee health benefits may no longer be an option for
any US company, since the Clinton administration is working on healthcare
reform which will probably require all employers to cover workers' insurance
payments. If they are to remain competitive, companies must find ways of
curbing health costs.
Until recently, most US companies offered benefits under the traditional
'indemnity' system. Under this system, employers pay workers' insurance
premiums. When the workers suffer illness, the insurance company covers most
of the cost. Many companies have found indemnity insurance expensive and
inefficient and have turned to 'managed health care'.
Under managed care, companies join forces with other groups in large-scale
organisations known as 'health maintenance organisations'.
HMOs claim to be cheaper than indemnity insurance. Their size means they
hold substantial bargaining power with physicians, pharmacies and other
healthcare providers.
Many HMOs cover millions of employees, usually concentrated in one region,
and this gives the organisation a great deal of influence on pricing.
Economies of scale help keep a lid on costs at the HMOs. 'Doctors and nurses
often spend an inordinate amount of time on administrative work,' said Alan
Raymond, a spokesman for Harvard Community Health Plan, one of the largest
HMOs in the country. 'If they join our network, we take care of all that for
them and everyone benefits.'
HMOs emphasise preventive medicine. Unlike indemnity plans, HMOs cover
regular check-ups, vaccinations and other benefits. Over the last few years,
many HMOs have extended their coverage to work-site health educational
programmes, diet workshops and fitness clubs.
There are some 550 HMOs in the US, covering about 15 per cent of the
population. According to health benefits consultants Foster Higgins, more
than half of all US corporations now offer HMO options to their employees.
HMO coverage is also extending to smaller companies. This is because many
small companies have joined forces through associations which agree to
handle the small companies' administrative work.
HMO plans are starting to pay dividends to the US private sector. A study by
Foster Higgins noted that the increase in health costs for HMOs rose 8.8 per
cent in 1992, compared with a 14.2 per cent surge for traditional indemnity
plans.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine to give details of
further DTI changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine will next week unveil fresh details of his plans to
revamp the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a closer partnership
between the government and business.
The trade and industry secretary is expected to use a keynote report to
outline the conclusions of his review of the department's structure and to
explain how he intends to refine it. He is also likely to give a summary of
the changes he has made so far.
Completion of the exercise has been delayed by the length of time Mr
Heseltine has had to devote to resolving the coal crisis.
In his first year in the job Mr Heseltine has taken a number of steps -
including reorganising the DTI's industrial divisions along sectoral lines -
which have been designed to make the department a more effective advocate of
the interests of British industry.
Recent moves have added to suspicions that he might be preparing to give his
interventionist instincts a more free rein. He is likely to emphasise in
public that his notion of intervention does not entail spending large sums
of money, however.
Earlier this month Mr Richard Needham, a trade and industry minister,
announced plans to encourage British companies to work more closely together
in bidding for large projects in foreign markets as part of a wide-ranging
effort to boost UK exports.
Mr Heseltine recently started recruiting some of the UK's biggest companies
to help with an initiative to monitor economic activity independently of the
Treasury.
The group of about 20 companies would give Mr Heseltine confidential
information about their sales trends in the critical period as Britain
attempts to move into an upturn, as well as advising him on long-term
industrial goals.
The move has been portrayed as an attempt to turn his department into an
economic powerhouse to rival the Treasury.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler leads effort to hold Newbury
for Conservatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday fired their opening shots in the Newbury
by-election campaign with a concerted attack on the Liberal Democrats'
record as 'natural allies' of the Labour party.
Underlining a key theme of its efforts to hold Newbury, Sir Norman Fowler,
the Tory party chairman, produced a list of examples where Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats were consistent supporters of minority Labour
councils. He cited seven councils in which the two opposition parties had
combined to share power.
Linking the by-election with the county council elections which are being
held simultaneously on May 6, Sir Norman said a vote for the Liberal
Democrats was one not for a 'lighter shade of blue' but for a 'deeper shade
of red'.
As Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat challenger, started his campaign in
the once-safe Tory seat, Sir Norman made it clear that the Conservative
strategy was to convince voters in both sets of elections that two main
opposition parties were indistinguishable.
The party chairman also signalled that the government's claims that economic
recovery was under way were likely to grow stronger and louder as the
campaign progressed. That strategy was echoed by Mr Julian Davidson, the
Conservative candidate, in a speech last night arguing that Newbury was
'uniquely placed' to profit from the move out of recession.
But the Liberal Democrats produced a Tory party document pointing out the
growing threat that the Liberal Democrats posed to the government.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Price for BTG sale is agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has been unable to agree the completion accounts for the sale
last year of the British Technology Group to a management-led consortium,
but has split the difference with the purchasers so that the initial
proceeds of the sale remain unchanged at Pounds 27.75m.
The decision is likely to lead to criticism that the government did not
maximise its profits from the privatisation of the agency for backing
inventors.
Mr Edward Leigh, the junior trade and industry minister, told MPs yesterday
that although the two sides had been unable to agree the accounts they had
agreed that no payment should be made either way.
The government insists that the arrangement represents the best deal
available, because there was a strong case on both sides of the argument,
and by agreeing to differ, both parties have saved the cost of taking the
disagreement to an independent arbitrator.
The arrangement does not affect the further payments - that could reach
several millions of pounds - that will be made for the technology-transfer
organisation over the five years after the sale if BTG's net income from
patent royalties exceeds a base level agreed with the Department of Trade
and Industry.

COMPULSORY tests to check the progress of children attending schools in

He condemned as a 'disgrace' the statement made by Ms Marion Darke,

The prime minister said: 'There is no doubt tests are the key to raising
standards, as our main competitors around the world have shown.'
Mr Peter Hardy (Lab Wentworth), a former teacher, claimed that the English

withdrawal along with that of Mr John Patten, the education secretary.

<TEXT>
Mark Homan, head of corporate reconstruction and insolvency at accountants
Price Waterhouse, is slipping on his surgeon's gloves to take up his
position as the new president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency.
Homan is particularly sensitive to the portrayal of insolvency practitioners
as corporate undertakers, and prefers to see them described as surgeons
helping companies to recover. With a year behind him as the society's
elected deputy president, he has had plenty of time to contemplate his plan
of action.
He says he has two main priorities during his year in office: to improve the
image of the insolvency profession, and to consolidate the position of the
recently-created society.
'Insolvency has been unjustly treated by the media,' he says. 'The press on
the whole is somewhat unthinking and uncaring in its comments. There is a
touch of the journalism of envy about it.'
A down-to-earth man of considerable height, he is well-equipped to take on
the press, though he says his preference is to be out in the field rescuing
companies. He says he will be speaking to journalists and encouraging his
colleagues to do the same, emphasising the strides made by the profession
after the introduction of tough entry requirements since the 1986 Insolvency
Act.
His second priority will be to achieve close liaison with the society's
regional organisations, and he places great emphasis on fostering the
involvement of smaller firms.
He will have to tread a careful path to avoid sensitive toes in the
relationship between the society - founded less than two years ago as a
trade association and proving increasingly active - and the Insolvency
Practitioners Association, which retains its role as a regulator and
licensor.
Homan joined Price Waterhouse as a trainee accountant in 1963 fresh from a
degree in industrial economics, with accountancy and law subsidiary
subjects. In the late 1960s he was seconded to work with Monty Eckman, the
firm's head of insolvency, and found himself effectively taking over the job
shortly after Eckman died unexpectedly in 1972.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Climbdown over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO IMPORTANT procedural decisions on the Maastricht bill yesterday sparked
chaotic scenes in the Commons as MPs pleaded with Mr Michael Morris, the
deputy speaker, to reconsider his ruling not to allow a vote on a
potentially crucial Labour amendment.
Proceedings eventually ended with the government accepting an embarrassing
but not disastrous reverse by declining to challenge a Labour motion that
the day's debate be brought to an early close to afford time for 'a
cooling-off period'.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, immediately hailed the
government's climbdown as a tactical victory, saying it showed it was in a
minority and without authority.
Mr Morris's ruling - delivered amid rowdy scenes on government and
opposition benches - had been followed by no less than an hour of varied and
sometimes heatedly expressed points of order.
The ruling confirmed that MPs would not be given a chance to vote on
Labour's amendment 27 that would remove the protocol containing Britain's
opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter.
His announcement came half an hour after the government indicated it would
accept a separate Labour clause - new clause 75 - that would make final
ratification contingent on a subsequent debate on this opt-out.
The conjunction of events suggested MPs would have no opportunity to vote on
the controversial social provisions of the treaty during the Maastricht
bill's committee stage.
Leading the cross-party chorus of dissent, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow
foreign secretary, provoked loud cheers from the Tory back benches when he
said the ruling set 'a very odd and dangerous procedural precedent'.
The case for a vote on amendment 27 remained 'as overwhelming as it always
has been'. Many would feel the house had been 'cheated'.
Mr Cunningham made clear that Labour would 'demand' the right to reintroduce
the matter at the report stage, which is due to follow the completion of
deliberations in committee and which will be presided over by Miss Betty
Boothroyd, the speaker.
There were particularly angry exchanges when Mr Cunningham said ministers
were briefing reporters that they proposed to ignore the vote triggered by
new clause 75 after it eventually took place.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, challenged him to name the
ministers concerned or withdraw the remark.
Mr Garel-Jones later prompted hilarity when he said he found it 'an
extraordinary proposition' that it should be a majority which decided
whether or not there was a vote on any given issue. One Labour MP commented
that such a remark would 'look good on the 6 o'clock news'.
Announcing his intention to take votes on a total of four amendments, Mr
Morris said the 'easy' option for him would have been to accept amendment
27.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM voices impatience over Serbia
sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S impatience to secure the UN Security Council's approval for action
to 'widen and deepen' sanctions against Serbia was underlined by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday.
He said Britain wanted the necessary resolution passed as speedily as
possible - 'we would have welcomed it today,' he said - and indicated that
the delay reflected concern about the implications for President Yeltsin in
the referendum in Russia next week.
Without naming Russia or its president, Mr Major explained that one of the
permanent members of the Security Council would be unlikely to support the
resolution at present although would do so later in the month.
Downing Street officials later re-affirmed that Russia could be expected to
vote for the UN Security Council resolution on April 26.
Mr Major came under strong pressure from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
to act with greater urgency. Mr Smith said a 'leisurely diplomatic pace' was
unacceptable given the daily slaughter in Srebrenica.
Mr Smith said Britain should be urging the security council to bring the
resolution forward so the international community could take effective
action.
The prime minister defended Britain's attempts to secure an end to the
fighting in Bosnia and distanced himself from the demands by Baroness
Thatcher, his predecessor, that the Bosnian Moslems should be allowed to
secure more weapons.
Mr Major stressed the need to 'damp down and not increase the supply of
arms'. He said Britain was looking for a diplomatic way to end the fighting
as the only 'credible way forward'.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR-union talks derailed - How
unions and British Rail are locked in a fight over the future of the
railways and who runs them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY's 24 hour railway strike, the second in a fortnight, is ostensibly
over the issues of compulsory redundancies and the use of contract work.
But as the conflict drags on, punctuated by interminable exchanges of
documents and arguments over semantics, it may precipitate a final showdown
in the industry on the issue of who runs the railways.
British Rail, the last of the old nationalised enterprises with a trade
union dominated work culture based on regulation and arcane procedure, is
having to adapt rapidly to the approaching challenge of privatisation and
increased competition.
This change will be painful for everybody in BR but most of all for the rail
unions who have exercised virtual joint control over the industry for the
past 45 years.
Faced with the prospect of an upheaval that will destroy their entrenched
positions, they appear intent on fighting a rearguard action that looks
self-destructive as commuters and business learn to live without railways.
BR chairman Sir Bob Reid claims the main rail union the RMT is 'living in a
different world' than the rest of Britain and demands it faces up to change.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, says he is appalled by the way he
and his union is being treated by Sir Bob. The union's left-leaning
executive seems ready to stiffen his resolve.
But from the outside, the conflict looks like a squabble over words.
Documents and letters have gone back and forth in recent weeks over the
quarter of a mile separating RMT headquarters and BR head office which have
often done more to muddy the issue of compulsory redundancies than clarify
it.
A total of 23 hours has been consumed in detailed discussions between the
rail unions and BR since November 19 when BR told the unions its trading
position required staff cutbacks, though every effort would be made to reach
these by voluntary means.
At the first meeting BR executive John Welsby assured the unions 'in the
final analysis staff would have the protection of the industry's existing
arrangements for redeployment and redundancy'. That meant BR would guarantee
no compulsory redundancies on the railways as enshrined in an agreement
signed in 1985 and known in the esoteric language of the industry as RT and
R 464.
This gives a clear 'assurance' that nobody will be dismissed from BR's
employment 'on grounds of redundancy' subject to the proviso they are
'prepared, if necessary, to accept an offer of alternative employment which
might involve a change of work or might require them to move to another
place of employment'.
Confusingly, BR management has not been ready to spell out that commitment
explicitly in its present dealings with the unions, at least on paper.
It was only under pressure from the media at a BR briefing two days ago that
the wording of the 1985 guarantee was finally revealed.
BR management say they cannot give any guarantee of 'jobs for life' but
eight years ago they made a commitment to the unions there would be no
compulsory redundancies on the railways.
This was not a new departure for BR. Three years earlier it accepted there
would be no compulsory redundancies when introduced flexible rostering for
train drivers and staffless stations.
Both sides are trapped by their history of joint regulation.
The RMT even quoted from a 1947 report earlier this week to justify its
position.
Every twist and turn is enshrined in written agreements and letters that BR
and the rail unions throw at each other with liturgical precision. It is
this often pedantic and time-consuming system that is now under threat as
the industry approaches the bracing world of privatisation.
'We are trying to prepare the railways for the next century', says Sir Bob
Reid. But the RMT and ASLEF seem ready to fight against radical change at a
heavy cost both to themselves and the travelling public.
By battling over a form of words the unions threaten Pounds 1bn worth of
business contracts at present under negotiation and Pounds 10m in lost gross
revenue to BR.
As Sir Bob Reid explains: 'Every time we have a shutdown of the railways,
people get used to living without us.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Judge, who staged a highly successful buy-out of Cadbury Schweppes food
interests under the Premier Brands label, is severing his formal links with
the venture capital industry to concentrate on his new task of reorganising
the Tory Party.
Judge, 43, has resigned as non-executive director of Grosvenor Development
Capital, the Slough-based venture capital group which featured, not always
to its advantage, in the recent BBC2 Series The Adventurers.
The Grosvenor link resulted from Judge's friendship with Grosvenor's late
chairman, David Beattie, from their time at Cadbury. Beattie was a one-time
managing director of Cadbury's speciality foods division while Judge was
group planning director.
Judge, who is also chairman of the food promotion organisation Food from
Britain, led a Pounds 97m buy-out of Premier Brands in 1986. He subsequently
resigned when a planned flotation did not go ahead and Premier was bought by
Hillsdown, a food conglomerate, for Pounds 182m in May 1989.
Appointed director general of the Tory Party last November, Judge has since
been engaged in a restructuring of the party organisation to reduce staff
levels and cut costs.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inland Revenue blocks unit trust
capital gains loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has closed a loophole which in effect allowed life
insurance companies to avoid paying capital gains tax on a portion of their
portfolios by investing in internally managed unit trusts.
The tax change, in the Finance Bill released on Tuesday, will force
insurance companies to deem one seventh of their unit trust holdings to have
been disposed of in any one year. If gains have occurred, capital gains tax
must be paid.
Some of Britain's largest unit trust companies are life insurers which sell
relatively few units to the public but use the trusts as internal investment
vehicles for their own life funds. Unit trusts do not incur capital gains
tax on disposals although unit trust holders must pay the tax on their gains
when their units are sold.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association, said:
'The implications for ordinary people are not huge. They may at the margin
reduce the after-tax returns of some life funds.'
The insurance industry, which has known of the change for two years,
initially objected but has resigned itself to the additional taxation. The
Inland Revenue has taken the view that the life insurance industry is
under-taxed and has moved to close a variety of loopholes in recent years.
The Revenue has, however, met a central concern of the insurance industry by
exempting from the legislation unit-linked contracts - where individual
policy holders would directly bear the costs of capital gains tax. The
change had been mooted two years ago but had been delayed pending repeal of
Stamp Duty.
The Association of British Insurers had lobbied the Revenue to ensure that
unit-linked policyholders were not subject to the additional tax burden.
The association expressed relief at the wording of the bill but said it
remained concerned that new rules on advance corporation tax on unit trusts
had unfairly penalised life insurers.
Life insurers, unlike other investors in unit trusts, classify dividends as
interest payments and will lose some tax advantages intended to offset a
reduction in the advance corporation tax which can be reclaimed by
tax-exempt investors.

FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Assisted area map delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is delaying until after next month's local elections an
announcement on the redrawn assisted-area map that will determine which UK
regions qualify for government and European Community aid.
The Department of Trade and Industry announcement this month, as previously
expected, would break informal Civil Service rules on announcements during
local election campaigns.
The re-drawing of the map - the first since 1984 - will provoke a political
row as parts of inner London and south-east England benefit at the expense
of areas in Wales, the Midlands and north-east England.
European Community rules mean the total area covered by the map cannot be
increased.
The plan had to await the outcome of the government's energy review after a
promise by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that some
regions hit by coal pit closures would be helped.
The Civil Service has tough guidelines on politic-ally sensitive government
announcements during general elections.

FT  16 APR 93 / Move to simplify power trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTRICITY industry will try to simplify controversial methods of
trading power as part of a wide-ranging review of the electricity wholesale
pool.
The decision yesterday by the electricity pool executive will be welcomed by
intensive energy users which say the trading system is understood by few and
is open to abuse.
In a three-pronged approach to reform, the executive, comprising
representatives from the electricity generators and regional power
companies, will also focus on 'demand-side participation' and transmission
services.
Supporters of demand-side participation argue that intensive users should be
rewarded more for flexibility over when and how they take electricity.
Examination of transmission services could include a look at whether pool
participants should pay varying prices depending on where they are located.
The reform of the pool was launched last year amid widespread complaints
from intensive energy users that they were paying too much for their
electricity following privatisation of the industry three years ago.
The pool was set up during privatisation. In last month's white paper on
coal, the government said it was considering whether to allow large users to
bypass the pool.
Some companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, have been pressing
to be allowed to buy electricity directly from generators.
Other pool participants say the effect of this would be to put up prices for
other consumers.
The white paper also noted suggestions that demand-side participation should
be introduced and said it would consult on whether this would be beneficial.

FT  16 APR 93 / Revenue computer staff vote for strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INLAND REVENUE computer staff have voted to take industrial action,
including a one-day strike, in protest at their division being
contracted-out to the private sector.
Industrial action by the traditionally moderate Inland Revenue Staff
Federation could disrupt the transfer of tax payments of up to Pounds 500m a
day to the Bank of England.
The Revenue said its management would take 'whatever action was necessary'
to maintain services so that a strike would have a minimal effect, if any,
on the national taxation system.
The information technology division, which employs 2,700 computer staff, is
the largest division to be contracted out within the Revenue.
Other smaller parts of the Revenue have been contracted out following market
testing, the first step in a process that can lead to the contracting-out of
services provided in-house. This year more than 44,000 civil servants are
having to compete against outside contractors to keep their jobs.
In-house bids are not being invited for the information technology division.
Invitations to tender for what unions claim is a privatisation are being
made at present with a rolling programme of contracting-out to begin next
January.
The federation, which represents about 2,000 of the staff, is opposed to the
move and is particularly concerned that staff should not be be adversely
affect.
A detailed 20-point claim has been submitted to management, including
demands for staff to be seconded to the new enterprise with an option to
transfer back to the Civil Service. Other demands include an employee
involvement scheme in the private company, full guarantees on terms and
conditions and pensions to be topped up on transfer.
Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the federation, said that if the
contracting-out went ahead his members wanted real choices about their
future and guarantees should be given about their pensions. He said that
confidential information about every taxpayer and business in the country
was being put at risk by the privatisation.
He added: 'Every week we hear of misuse of personal information by finance
companies and yet the government insists on putting everyone's tax affairs

Two ballots calling for protection of terms and conditions should

FT  16 APR 93 / Commercial role for Radio 1 studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Radio Authority, which regulates the independent radio sector, is to
commission research into the economic feasibility of turning BBC Radio 1
into a commercial channel financed entirely by advertising revenue.
The authority disclosed this yesterday in a response to the green paper on
the future of the BBC. It also demanded that the BBC be required to transfer
to commercial radio some of its existing FM frequency capacity and proposed
that the present system of separate regulation of commercial and
public-service radio and television broadcasting be ended.
The authority said that if any present BBC services were permitted to carry
advertising or sponsorship, they should not remain within the organisation.
It was unsure of the impact on independent national radio operators of
turning Radio 1 into a commercial operation and was commissioning
independent research, to be completed by the end of the year.
However, the authority suggested that if Radio 1 were to be funded entirely
by advertising, it should be subjected to temporary restrictions to prevent
it draining revenue from the three planned independent national radio
broadcasters.
The authority estimated that Radio 1 would need, and could expect, to
generate annual advertising revenue of at least Pounds 30m to be
commercially viable. At present commercial radio generated Pounds 53m
annually from national advertisers.
That figure excluded the revenues of the two independent national services
so far granted licences, Classic FM and Virgin, which needed together to
earn between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m annually to break even.
The authority said: 'It is reasonable to assume that the entry of a Radio 1
type of service into the commercial sector would expand the advertiser base
of radio and that a commercial Radio 1 . . . would break even within two
years.' Soon after that happened, the three independent national services
should return to profit.
It added that the existing distribution of national FM frequencies unfairly
favoured the BBC and damaged the ability of independent national radio to
compete. It called for frequencies to be reallocated, but recognised that
such a change was unlikely to happen during the existing licences of
independent national radio broadcasters.
The authority also urged that, in the longer term, BBC and commercial
broadcasting should be regulated by the same bodies, one for radio and one
for television.

FT  16 APR 93 / Caution over next prison contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT private-sector contract to provide prison escort services will be
introduced on a phased basis, Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison
Service, said yesterday.
Switching the entire east Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire contract to
Group 4 Court Services on a single day was a significant cause of subsequent
problems, Mr Lewis and directors of the security company decided at a
meeting yesterday.
During Group 4's first week of running the contract four prisoners escaped
or were wrongly released, and others were delivered late for court
appearances.
Tendering for the next contract, covering the London area, will begin soon
with Group 4 among the bidders. Companies submitting bids will now be asked
to plan for a gradual switch from the public sector to the private sector.
Yesterday's meeting ended with Mr Lewis saying that only one of last week's
four disappearances by prisoners could be attributed to Group 4.
Two resulted from design flaws in vehicles which had been built to Home
Office specifications, while a local magistrates court had confirmed that
Group 4 was not at fault in the release of the fourth pris-oner.
The government's five-year contract with Group 4, worth Pounds 9.5m a year,
allows for financial penalties but none will be imposed over last week's
problems.
There will, however, be another meeting between the Prison Service and Group
4 in a month to review the operation of the contract.
It requires Group 4 to collect and return a different number of prisoners
each day from 71 police stations, 20 prisons, 72 magistrates courts and 10
Crown courts. Prison Service and Group 4 officials say that last week's
start-up was complicated by a number of unscheduled court sessions.
Mr Lewis stressed that escapes by prisoners under police or Prison Service
escort were not uncommon. 'It is very regrettable and we intend to reduce
them, but the experience of last week needs to be seen in that context.'
Mr Jim Harrower, managing director of Group 4, said the company had been
hurt badly and embarrassed by last week's problems. He was convinced,
however, that 'with all agencies playing their part we will meet the terms
of the contract'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday brushed aside Commons attacks
by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs on the Group 4 contract, insisting that
the number of escapes was 'not out of the ordinary,' Ivor Owen writes.
To laughter and cheers from the opposition benches Mr Tony Blair, the shadow
home secretary, claimed Group 4's performance could have graced one of
Ealing Studios' comedy films.
Mr Clarke maintained that the use of private-sector companies for such
duties freed police officers for their primary role of tackling crime.

FT  16 APR 93 / Lloyd's faces new criticism on regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS of four lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates artificially inflated
their profits in the 1980s through the improper use of specialised
reinsurance policies, a detailed report alleges.
A 200-page report prepared by GW Run Off, which is now handling the affairs
of the syndicates, was passed to the Serious Fraud Office earlier this week,
and has prompted fresh criticisms of regulation at Lloyd's.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which is
co-ordinating the Names' own legal action said: 'It reveals an appalling
state of affairs. It shows a total failure of regulation by Lloyd's'
One agency manager said the events showed that the system had failed Gooda
Names completely. 'We have to recognise that.'
The report's findings have also been sent to the insurance market's
investigation committee, which has been examining the syndicates for some
months. The report could also be used as evidence in the legal action being
taken by more than 2,000 Gooda Walker Names against their agents.
Members of the Gooda Walker syndicates are among the worst-hit of the
insurance market's Names - the individuals who supply its capital. Their
losses amount to more than Pounds 900m, with many individuals facing losses
of more than Pounds 1m.
The report focuses on the use by Gooda Walker syndicates of 'time and
distance' policies - reinsurance policies which allow Lloyd's syndicates to
manage their reserves against long-tail claims - which emerge many years
after the inception of policies - more effectively.
Such deals allow insurers to 'discount' their reserves against future
claims. Policyholders pay a reinsurance premium which is then invested by
the reinsurer, with the proceeds - less a profit for the reinsurer - repaid
at an agreed future date to meet claims.
Insurers are allowed to credit future benefits from such policies in the
year in which they buy the policy. The report shows that between 1980 and
1988 the profits of four syndicates - numbers 164, 290, 295 and 298 - were
increased by some Pounds 37m as a result.
In some years in the early 1980s virtually all profits were generated from
such policies. But few details of the policies were included in syndicate
accounts.
During these same years the profitability of Gooda Walker syndicates
attracted many Names to join, with each of the syndicates' capacity - or
capital base - expanding significantly.
The report says that the re-insurers of some of the policies in turn
reinsured their exposures with the same Gooda Walker syndicates.
The investigators were unable to find any evidence that the Gooda Walker
syndicates had prepared formal cashflow forecasts which would detail when
they expect future claims to emerge. These are essential for the controlled
use of 'time and distance' policies.
Warnings from Lloyd's regulators that 'there could be no question of (a
Gooda Walker syndicate) reinsuring its own risk back to another Gooda Walker
syndicate' were apparently ignored, the report adds.
Investigators have identified three policies purchased from Pinnacle (the
Bermuda-based company which provided reinsurance to the Gooda Walker
syndicates), elements of which were reinsured to other Gooda Walker
syndicates.

FT  16 APR 93 / Government to provide Pounds 5.5m for 'one-stop shops'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 23 business advice centres will be set up in the six areas which
have won official government approval for their 'one-stop shop' programmes.
The six areas will receive Pounds 5.57m of government funding over the first
three years, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a
written parliamentary answer yesterday. The areas are: Birmingham, Halton
(north and mid-Cheshire), Hertfordshire, Manchester, south and east
Cheshire, and Tyneside.
Birmingham will have just one centrally located advice centre. Hertfordshire
and Manchester will each have six; Halton will have two, in Widnes and
Runcorn; Tyneside will have five; and south and east Cheshire will have
three.
The first 'one-stop shops' are expected to open in July starting with three
in Manchester and one each in Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead.
A further nine areas have been allocated 'one-stop shops' provided they
modify their business plans.
The government said it hoped they would be able to establish their centres
within the next 12 months. The nine areas are Chester and the Wirral, south
Derbyshire, Shropshire, Merseyside, Hereford and Worcestershire, Doncaster,
Leicestershire, Surrey and Dorset.
In addition, government funds will be provided to allow Training and
Enterprise Councils and other support organisations in London to prepare
plans for a London-wide network of one-stop shops.

FT  16 APR 93 / Electronic games enter a new level: What a US court victory
for two giant-slayers means for Nintendo and Sega
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE electronic games market is a battlefield, both on and off-screen.
On-screen, Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario the plumber exchange fisticuffs with
a host of enemies. Off-screen, the large manufacturers wage
multi-million-dollar court actions in an effort to protect copyrights. Most
take place in the US, the most lucrative market.
Sometimes the giant-slayers win. Brothers Richard and David Darling, who own
Codemasters, a software publisher, heard last month that the US Supreme
Court declined to hear an appeal from Nintendo in an action against Lewis
Galoob Toys, Codemasters' US licensee, giving them a clear victory after a
two-year case.
Nintendo and Sega, another Japanese company, dominate the international
Pounds 9.2bn electronic games market. Nintendo was required to deposit a
Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) bond in the US courts. It may now be required to
forfeit that bond to Lewis Galoob, Codemasters, and Camerica, a Canadian
licensee of Codemasters' products.
In the US case Nintendo acted against one of Codemasters' best-selling
products, a copyrighted enhancer called Game Genie, which Codemasters claims
has achieved international sales of Dollars 100m.
It is an important victory. The managing director of one of the UK's leading
retailers of electronic games is convinced that opening the door to the
development of independent makers of games peripherals will be good news for
both consumers and retailers. He said: 'For us, peripheral products are very
important. Nintendo have always been able to fix their prices and it's
really been a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Their success was due to their
controlling hardware and software 100 per cent.'
Nintendo is appealing against forfeiting its Dollars 15m bond, of which
Dollars 3.4m is due to the Darlings, and may take their appeal all the way
back to the US Supreme Court. It could be another year before the Darlings
see any cash from the case. By that time legal fees, which US lawyers
involved in the case say may reach Dollars 1.5m, will have eroded the final
pot.
But what really counts is the go-ahead in the US for Codemasters' business.
The stakes in this game are high. Mr Philip Ley, marketing director of Sega
Europe, says 40 per cent of homes in Japan and 30 per cent in the US have a
games console. In the UK alone the electronic games market in 1992 was worth
some Pounds 500m and some industry analysts estimate that could double in
1993.
At the heart of the off-screen conflict are problems of definition
concerning peripherals - a broad category including everything from
joysticks and screen-magnifiers to game 'enhancers', which clip on to game
cassettes and give the player extras, such as additional 'lives' for the
central characters.
The vast majority of the peripherals market is occupied by Sega and Nintendo
products, so independents represent a threat to their grip on an
increasingly important segment of the electronic games market. One UK
retailer said: 'The only way the giants can combat the independent makers of
peripherals is in the courts - and you try and find a jury which understands
the technicalities of computer programming.'
The main question is when is something proprietary - exclusive to the
original system manufacturer - and when not? It's a very grey area and some
main figures in the industry see Nintendo and Sega eventually losing their
control. They expect other big Japanese electronics companies, such as Sony
and Matshushita to get into games software.
Both independent software producers and the large manufacturers run into
conflicts because copyright laws, both in the EC and the US, are thought
inadequate by some legal experts.
A London-based lawyer said yesterday: 'You have difficulties applying
copyright law to computer programs. When copyright law was first designed
computers had never been heard of. Copyright is intended to protect an
expression, not an idea. You get into very difficult questions with computer
programs about what is an expression and what exactly is an idea, where the
two coincide. That is what has caused a lot of the controversy.'
To some extent, Nintendo and Sega have been able to grow by introducing
technologically advanced hardware and feeding an apparently insatiable
demand for new games. But the importance of software peripherals is set to
expand.
It is, industry sources say, impossible to estimate the scale of potential
market, such is the rapid growth in electronic games.

THE USE of security video cameras has helped to cut crime in two towns,
police said yesterday.
In Airdrie, Lanarkshire, the equipment had helped to reduce crimes by more
than 75 per cent in the first five months of operation. Detection rates had
grown from 35.5 per cent to more than 70 per cent.
And Mr Barrie Loftus, project officer for King's Lynn, Norfolk, said car
thefts were down by 91 per cent and thefts from vehicles by 97 per cent.

FT  16 APR 93 / Union discovers vote discrepancies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INITIAL internal inquiry by the Association of University Teachers into
the recent election of its general secretary has uncovered discrepancies,
the union has told the government's Certification Office.
Mr Alan Waton, AUT president, says in a letter to the office that a number
of significant differences had been found in eight local associations
between 'the number of members paying dues last September and the number of
labels received in the general secretary and recent officer elections'.
He added: 'We have immediately put in hand investigations to ascertain the
reasons for these differences.'
The inquiry follows a formal complaint from Dr Peter Borchards who was
defeated by Mr David Triesman, the executive's preferred candidate, by 7,088
votes to 6,812 for the top post in the union in the postal ballot in
December.
A final report on the election is to be made to the AUT executive on July 2.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAYMAKERS will stay away from resorts unless action is taken to clean up
UK beaches, says a study led by the World Health Organisation.
The report, published in the British Medical Journal, says a variety of
litter and medical waste including plastic fishing gear, polystyrene foam,
clothing, glass and syringes, was found by volunteers in an investigation in
1991 by the Norwich Union Coastwatch UK.
The findings were checked by Dr Robin Phillipp, director of the World Health
Organisation Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health Promotion and
Ecology, and a team from Farnborough College of Technology.
The report says: 'If our personal and collective efforts for litter and
pollution control are not improved, the findings reported here suggest that
at least in south-western England, a very popular area for summer tourists,
there could be considerable consequences from adhering to the British
Medical Journal's recent advice that 'if a beach looks filthy, don't swim in
the sea'.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Shell cuts gallon of petrol by 13.6p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL last night cut the maximum price of its petrol by 13.6p a gallon, in
effect wiping out the increase caused by the increase in fuel tax in the
Budget, David Lascelles writes.
Shell's move follows price cuts two weeks ago by Esso and BP. However Shell
said many of its stations were already selling petrol at the lower price
because of local competition.
Falling petrol prices have been made possible by the strength of sterling
against the dollar and the resulting drop in the sterling price of oil.
Shell's new maximum recommended prices are 226.9p for a gallon of unleaded
and 249.6p for 4-star leaded.
BP said last night that it intended to remain competitive, although no
decision on a further price cut had been taken.

FT  16 APR 93 / Miners defy NUM on pit closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS at Easington colliery in County Durham have voted overwhelmingly not
to challenge the closure of their pit in order to safeguard their redundancy
payments.
In defiance of National Union of Mineworkers national policy, the men have
decided their colliery - flashpoint of some of the biggest confrontations in
the 1984-85 miners' strike - should not be put into the consultative
colliery review procedure.
British Coal announced yesterday that Easington and the Westoe colliery, in
South Shields, Tyne and Wear, will cease production on May 7. Both are to be
mothballed in case there is interest from the private sector in taking them
over.
Mr Alan Cummings, Easington NUM secretary, said a mass meeting had
instructed union officials to negotiate the best possible redundancy
payments with British Coal. The miners had turned Easington around from loss
to profit but felt it was futile to challenge closure.
He added: 'They've recognised what's happened since 1985, no pit which has
gone through the procedure has been saved. People have said, why pile on the
agony?'
Behind the decision lies the fear that, should the pit go to review, the
miners would be kept on the payroll on basic pay. This could affect their
redundancy payments, since they are calculated on the final 12 weeks' pay.
Productivity bonuses can boost earnings by as much as 30 per cent.
Redundancy payments for workers with long service could reach Pounds 37,000.
Easington, which now has 1,050 workers, dates back to 1899. Mr Cummings said
geological problems had caused some production problems recently.

FT  16 APR 93 / Reading list that turns new leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARK Twain and Ray Bradbury rub shoulders with Charlotte Bronte and Susan
Hill, and Dickens and Shakespeare jostle with Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Henrik Ibsen in the National Curriculum Council's suggested English
literature reading list for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Even Philip
Larkin gets a mention.
One immediate effect of the list will be to boost sales for writers not yet
widely read in schools, according to Penguin, the publishers owned by the
Pearson Group, which also owns the Financial Times.
Mr Patrick Hutchinson, Penguin's marketing and sales director, described the
list as mainly 'safe and traditional'. But he added that inclusion on the
list would help sales of some of the lesser-known modern authors.
He said: 'When the list for primary schools came out three years ago, many
schools didn't have the resources to buy all the books. Parents then rushed
out to the shops and bought copies for the children, so this is going to
propel authors on to shelves where they may not have been before.'
Appearances on reading lists reliably increase book sales.
The proposals prescribe that children between 11 and 14 (Key Stage Three)
should read at least one Shakespeare play, then read another between 14 and
16 (Key Stage Four). These must come from separate categories - the
histories, tragedies and comedies.
Beyond this, 11-to-14-year-olds should read drama 'appropriate for their
age' - one suggestion is Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood - while
14-to-16-year-olds have to read at least one play by an author from a list
that includes Arthur Miller, J B Priestley, Oscar Wilde, Robert Bolt, Tom
Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Henrik Ibsen.
Requirements for poetry include more imaginative choices. At both key
stages, children must read works by at least five poets, of whom at least
two should have been published before 1900.
The list at Key Stage Four includes a number of writers less well-exposed.
In addition to Blake, Coleridge, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Donne
and Chaucer, modern poets such as Brian Patten, Derek Walcott, Sylvia Plath,
Dannie Abse and Norman MacCaig are included.
Modern writers who might hope for a boost from sales include Jan Mark,
Rukshana Smith, Michelle Magorian, Beverly Naidoo, Anne Holm, Berlie
Doherty, Joan Lingard, Katherine Paterson, Rosa Guy, Marjorie Darke and Gwyn
Thomas.
Teachers reacted with alarm to the amount of Shakespeare prescribed,
regardless of childrens' ability. Ms Judith Rowley, an English teacher from
the Morton School in Carlisle, said: 'I'm certainly not against Shakespeare,
and I would expect to read one of his plays with a top set by the age of 12
or 13, but as far as the lower groups are concerned I would be doubtful
about it.'
She also voiced concern about the inclusion of Ibsen and Solzhenitsyn.

FT  16 APR 93 / Charity shops 'make 27% profit' on small turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TYPICAL high-street charity shop made a profit of 27 per cent on weekly
sales and donations of Pounds 963, a survey published today shows.
Oxfam has the largest sales and profits of any charity, followed by Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, the Spastics Society and Barnados.
The survey, by NGO Finance, a magazine for finance staff in the
non-governmental sector, covered the most recent accounts of 2,760 shops run
by 26 charities - there are estimated to be 4,671 shops run by 41 charities
around the country.
The most profitable shops were the Alzheimer's shop in Teesside, the Earl
Mountbatten Hospice and Age Concern in Sevenoaks, Kent. This partly reflects
low overheads because of the use of volunteer staff.
Cash donations in shops made up just 1 per cent of income, with 85 per cent
from donated goods and 14 per cent from bought-in goods.
The information is particularly important because Sorp 2, the new draft
recommended accounting standard for charities, will require trading
operations to be consolidated into organisations' group accounts.
A number of large charities did not respond to the survey, or provided
incomplete information, including the National Trust, Age Concern, the
British Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
There was a wide range of accounting treatments adopted, with the People's
Dispensary for Sick Animals charging against profits all capital expenditure
in shops in the year in which it is made.
Few shops provided information on return on capital employed or similar
measures of performance.

FT  16 APR 93 / NAO urges better advice on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-EMPLOYED people on low incomes often mistakenly believe they do not
qualify for social security support, the National Audit Office says in a
report today.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, calls on the Benefits
Agency to improve the supply of information for self-employed people working
part-time.
Last year people who were or had been self-employed received Pounds 700m in
social security income support. Almost all the claimants - 250,000 - were
completely dependent on benefit, with only 8,000 still in part-time
self-employment.
The report says that the office, the public spending watchdog, found a
widespread but mistaken perception that, because the self-employed did not
qualify for unemployment benefit, they could not receive other help from the
social security system. If the option of continuing to work were better
publicised, more people might remain in self-employment and top up modest
earnings with benefits.
The report says Benefits Agency offices in southern England faced pressure
from the large numbers of formerly self-employed people now claiming income
support.
The agency recognised the difficulties faced by these customers and was
taking 'strong remedial action' to improve services.

FT  16 APR 93 / Steel users warn over price increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL USERS yesterday warned that they would be forced to pass on to their
customers the second round of price rises to be announced this year by
British Steel.
The company this week notified customers of further price increases of up to
9 per cent which will be imposed during the next three months on a range of
products.
Increases of between 4 per cent and 13 per cent announced in January have
been fully implemented in recent weeks.
British Steel, which recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m in the six months
to last October, said the planned rises would only partly reverse the severe
reductions in steel prices experienced over the past two years.
Some prices had dropped by up to 35 per cent since 1990. British Steel said
continuing inadequate levels of return meant further price rises appeared
likely over the next six months.
The British Constructional Steelwork Association, whose members supply
fabricated steelwork to the construction sector, said that it acknowledged
the need for British Steel to raise prices, given increases in the company's
own costs. But it said its members could not absorb higher prices.
The association said: 'We have cut down to the bone and beyond in terms of
prices. The last British Steel price rises were all passed on and we will
have to do the same again.'
British Steel said that it would reduce rebates available on the majority of
its structural section products from May 1, representing increases of
between 6 per cent and 8 per cent.
A cut in rebates for steel plate, representing rises of 6 per cent, will
take effect on June 1. Strip products will rise in price from July 1 by up
to 9 per cent.
British Steel said that the past six weeks had provided evidence of a marked
improvement in sales, largely because customers appeared to be rebuilding
stocks.

FT  16 APR 93 / Hope for improved language skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS yesterday welcomed the new national curriculum for English, saying
industry was demanding better communication skills from recruits.
Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington Crystal, one of the largest
employers in Cornwall, said: 'Many young people coming into industry do not
have a fully developed command of the English language and I welcome any
steps that seek to remedy that.'
Mr Dancer, like other employers, said young people who were not able to
express themselves adequately were at a particular disadvantage in the jobs
market.
Inability to speak or write English was not only a disadvantage to
recruitment on the shop floor but would disqualify an individual from a job
which involved contact with the public. 'People who are communicating
externally have to enhance, not detract from a company's image,' said Mr
Dancer.
Cadbury, the Birmingham-based confectionery company, said it did not believe
standards of written and spoken English had deteriorated - rather, companies
such as itself were demanding more from recruits, both school-leavers and
graduates.
Mr Neil Makin, Cadbury's personnel director, said five years ago the company
had recruited most of its school leavers through the Youth Training Scheme.
'It did not matter if applications were made in writing that was not joined
up or grammar was shoddy in interviews.'
But the company now aimed to recruit more school-leavers who had the
potential for a full career path, which could take them as high as
management.
'We are now looking for the best, rather than recruiting from an
unemployment scheme,' said Mr Makin. The ability to express oneself fluently
in standard English was important, he said.

FT  16 APR 93 / Fishermen meet to decide next step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN from ports throughout England and Wales meet tomorrow to decide
the next phase of their campaign against the government's fisheries policy.
Some of the representatives - between 30 and 40 - attending the special
meeting of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations executive in
Derby are expected to favour more blockades, which in the past four weeks
have disrupted shipping in and out of Teesport, Plymouth, and the Mersey
estuary ports.
Executive member Mr Bill Madine, chairman of the group's West Coast
committee and organiser of Wednesday's Mersey blockade, has predicted the
meeting will back further similar action.
Protests would continue, he said, until the men received satisfaction from
the government.
'The resolve of MAFF (the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) is
starting to melt,' said Mr Madine, a trawler fisherman from Whitehaven,
Cumbria. 'I would think some members will be saying, we have a roll on,
let's keep it going.'
Yesterday Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the organisation said:
'Nothing is ruled out.'
But he added he felt the maximum publicity may have been obtained from
blockades considering three had been held, and suggested the meeting may
decide on other action, saying: 'It ranges from non-compliance with the new
regulations to doing other things.'
He declined to elaborate further.
The fishermen's blockades hoped to raise public awareness of their
opposition to cheap fish imports and the new Sea Fish Conservation Act,
which will restrict the number of days UK fishing boats can put to sea. The
order allocating the days is to be placed before parliament shortly.

FT  16 APR 93 / London estate agency fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLKARD &amp; HAYWARD Services, one of London's largest independent estate
agents, and its sister company Phillip Charles, yesterday went into
administrative receivership with debts of Pounds 1.3m.
The failure reflects the continued pressure on estate agents' incomes
resulting from the collapse in the housing market over the past three years.
In spite of expectations that lower interest rates would feed through into
an improvement in the housing market, an increased level of interest from
buyers had not been translated into sales. 'The hit rate was not as high as
anticipated,' said Mr Jason Elles of Ernst &amp; Young, who was appointed
administrative receiver.
Folkard &amp; Hayward has 11 offices in London that sell properties valued up to
Pounds 500,000. Phillip Charles, which caters for first-time buyers, has
nine offices in the home counties. Its turnover was about Pounds 2m a year.
Mr Elles said the businesses would continue to trade while they sought other
buyers. There were Pounds 500,000 of deals in the pipeline which he hoped
would go ahead.
Mr Elles said he expected to find a buyer for most shops in the next week. A
number of potential buyers, including some building societies and
individuals, had expressed interest. 'I have already held discussions with a
number of interested parties and am optimistic that any early sale of the
businesses will be achieved,' Mr Elles added.
Folkard &amp; Hayward, founded in 1899, has been through several changes of
ownership. The latest owners, Mr Roger Stanley and his wife, bought the
business five months ago. The previous owner was Birmingham Midshires, the
building society, which was the main lender, together with Provident Life.
London estate agents have reported a surge in interest from potential buyers
in recent weeks, although the activity over the bank holiday weekend was
widely found to be disappointing.

FT  16 APR 93 / Teachers 'will need more support'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of the National Curriculum Council warned last night that some
teachers will need to be coached to teach standard English in their
classrooms.
Mr David Pascall said English was the most important of the 10 national
curriculum subjects. The new proposals were not just for the children's
benefit, but the aim was to improve standards for teachers too, he said.
Proper pronunciation, for example, was defined in the rules produced
yesterday.
The council said that reform of the English curriculum was essential if
standards of written and spoken English were to be improved.
Mr Pascall said: 'Some teachers will need more support because they will
find things within this new order which would be outside their competence.
'We are redressing the balance and we have to do it sensibly.'
Mr Pascall also said that the producers of children's television programmes
would have to take their part in improving standards of English.
'I am appalled by the standard of children's television programmes.
Producers should accept their responsibilities by trying to improve
standards mainly for young children,' Mr Pascall said.
'Producers need to take seriously the content of programmes in order to
complement what we are trying to do.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Auditors seek to limit legal actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST eight UK accounting firms are planning to launch a campaign to
protect themselves from increasing litigation against auditors.
They have hired consultants and are considering a range of options including
legal reform to limit court damages which can be awarded against them.
They are likely to call for changes to Section 310 of the 1985 Companies
Act, which forbids accountants from being able to contractually limit their
liability.
Their concern follows a rise in the number and value of law suits brought
particularly in the US by investors and other users of audited accounts.
Many firms say litigation is rising to levels where it will either drive
them into insolvency or force them to cease acting as auditors.
The campaign follows lobbying in the US by a pressure group of accounting
groups.
The informal gathering last week of the heads of the 'Big Eight' accounting
firms received a report commissioned from a political lobbying group.
It is believed to have suggested that many lawyers, politicians, academics
and accountants were sympathetic to reform.
Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner of Arthur Andersen in London, is
co-ordinating the Big Eight's campaign in the UK. The other firms are
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, Price Waterhouse,
Touche Ross, Grant Thornton and BDO Binder Hamlyn.

FT  16 APR 93 / Engineering recovery 'threatened'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAGILE recovery in UK engineering output is being threatened by deepening
recession in vital European export markets, according to the Engineering
Employers' Federation.
The federation said yesterday in its latest economic trends report that all
the main engineering sectors, except aerospace equipment and metal goods,
could expect higher sales over the months ahead.
Forecast engineering sales for 1993 of Pounds 130bn represent a modest
improvement over the 1992 total of Pounds 128bn and will only restore
industry sales to the level achieved in 1980. Total engineering output by
the first half of 1994 is expected to be 3 per cent up on the level recorded
in the second half of last year, with electronics and components for the
motor vehicle industry showing most growth.
In spite of a calculation by the federation of a 7 per cent improvement in
the cost competitiveness of UK manufactured goods over the last four years,
it forecasts a continuing imbalance between engineering exports and imports.
While exports in the next 18 months are expected to rise 5 per cent, imports
are forecast to increase 10 per cent.
It also warned there will be no significant recovery in engineering activity
until EC markets - which account for 55 per cent of UK engineering exports -
also improve.
Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, predicted a 'very slow and
difficult recovery'. He said EC customers were of critical importance and
that the weakness of European markets was restricting the scope for an
export-led UK recovery.
He warned that the continuing political upheaval over the future shape of
European development was 'becoming dangerous and damaging to UK interests'.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty, he added, would have serious
consequences for the engineering industry, just as it began to detect signs
of growth.
Unemployment in the engineering industries represents another continuing
blackspot. According to federation estimates, the average level of
engineering employment in the first half of 1993 is about 1.7m, compared
with just over 2m at the start of 1990. Employment is expected to fall
another 45,000 over the next 12 months.
The federation also points to continuing under-investment in the engineering
sector, with investment levels forecast to be lower at the end of 1994 than
in 1989.

FT  16 APR 93 / Customers could be the winners in AT&amp;T and BT battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DO AT&amp;T's plans to challenge BT in the UK telecommunications market
mean for its customers?
Cheaper calls for a start, as competition erodes the cosy 'correspondent'
arrangements where national carriers co-operate rather than compete across
national boundaries. Instead there could be head-to-head rivalry in
international and domestic markets.
There is the prospect of cost-effective, 'seamless' international
communications services with only one company and one set of bills.
AT&amp;T says it intends to offer British business customers virtual network
services and digital private lines for high-speed data and voice
communications.
Assuming AT&amp;T's request is granted, what effect will new competition have on
the UK telecommunications market? Analysts yesterday argued that Mercury was
more likely than BT to suffer from AT&amp;T's presence in its home market.
BT, for example, intends to offer similar services in the US to those AT&amp;T
plans to offer in the UK. It believes that access to the lucrative US market
will give it advantages well worth the risk of extra competition from AT&amp;T
in the UK.
Mercury, on the other hand, is much smaller and has specialised in the
business market where AT&amp;T is focusing its efforts.
AT&amp;T's application is the latest move in a complex regulatory game of give
and take being played across global telecommunications markets.
It is no surprise that AT&amp;T is trying to use its influence with the Federal
Communications Commission - the US watchdog - and the Clinton administration
to block BT's application as a bargaining measure. AT&amp;T's stand is similar
to that of the large US airlines, which recently tried to prevent British
Airways buying a stake in USAir on the grounds that US carriers should first
have greater access to the UK market.
It would offer business customers with locations in the UK and US a variety
of 'competitively priced, seamless services' between the two countries.
The principal telecommunications carriers such as AT&amp;T and BT are resigned
to these changes and are preparing themselves for the battle for customers
that will ensue. What remains to be thrashed out are the terms on which the
various players will have access to each other's networks and markets. This
is what lies behind calls for 'equivalence' or reciprocal access
arrangements, guaranteeing a level playing field. For BT and AT&amp;T to fulfil
their goals of becoming global 'supercarriers', they must have access to
each other's markets. Both complain about the regulatory regimes they have
to surmount.
Mr John Berndt, president of AT&amp;T business services, said the greatest
challenge in providing advanced services in the UK was that BT in effect
controlled the local distribution of almost all phone services in the UK and
dominated the British long-distance market.
'As a result, in order to terminate calls to customers, would-be competitors
not only have to invest substantial time and money in building their own
networks, they also have no alternative but to negotiate with BT for access
to customers.'
He said this contrasted with the US where years of pro-competition
regulatory policies had given competitors such as BT the opportunity to
enter the market with limited investment. Mr Berndt added that the US
regulator's approval of BT's plan could adversely affect the US balance of
payments, as more calls are made from the US to the UK than vice versa. US
carriers paid BT more than Dollars 65m last year.

FT  16 APR 93 / Venture-backed companies upbeat

<TEXT>
COMPANIES which have received financial backing from the venture capital
industry have performed well over the past six months and are very
optimistic about future prospects, a survey has found.
The British Venture Capital Association found that 79 per cent of
venture-backed companies expect sales to increase over the next six months
while 49 per cent expect profit margins to improve and 33 per cent expect
their average selling prices to rise.
Forty-eight per cent expect to increase the size of their workforce.
The survey of just over 200 companies carried out last month was the first
of what is intended to be a six-monthly review of business trends among
companies backed by venture capital.
In the preceding six months 61 per cent of companies surveyed reported
higher sales, 49 per cent increased profit margins and 30 per cent higher
average selling prices. A total of 42 per cent increased the size of their
workforce.
Asked which change in the business environment which would benefit their
company most, 59 per cent of respondents said a recovery in economic
confidence, while 14 per cent mentioned lower interest rates.
A lack of demand for their products or services was given as the principal
obstacle to taking on more employees by 46 per cent of businesses, followed
by 16 per cent which mentioned wages and other costs.
Forty-one per cent of respondents said they expected to need additional
finance in the next six months.
Of these, venture capitalists and the banks were joint favourite sources of
funding and each was mentioned by 59 per cent of respondents.

FT  16 APR 93 / IAD receivers confident of sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE administrative receivers for International Automotive Design (UK), the
design and engineering consultancy, hope to agree to a sale of the company
within days.
The company, one of Europe's biggest automotive design and engineering
companies, went into administrative receivership last week with debts of
about Pounds 13.5m.
Mr Maurice Withall of accountants Grant Thornton, one of the joint
administrative receivers, said offers for IAD had been received from several
UK companies. 'We are very hopeful and expect to be successful in selling
the business as a going concern.'
Mr Godfrey Harker, group finance director, said the company's debts included
bank debt of Pounds 7m, trade debt of Pounds 4m and Pounds 2.5m owed to the
Inland Revenue. It expected to make a loss of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m on
turnover of up to Pounds 52m in the year to the end of this month. Turnover
had begun to fall sharply since mid-1992.
The strain on the company's finances was increased by the financial collapse
in February of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, which owed it around Pounds
500,000.
The company, based at Worthing, West Sussex, has carried out contracts for
many of the world's leading vehicle makers since it was formed in 1976 by Mr
John Shute. Mr Shute and his family owns 77.5 per cent while 22.5 per cent
is held by Cinven, the UK's second largest venture capital investor.

THE European Commission has accused a group of shipping companies of
operating an illegal cartel to push up prices for transatlantic cargo and is
telling them to sever all ties, Commission officials said, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
They said the Commission had opened proceedings and was giving those
involved in the cargo-shipping pact - the Transatlantic Agreement - three
weeks to disband the cartel. The companies had broken EC rules on
competition by teaming up on pricing for US-bound cargo shipments from
European ports, they said.
The agreement involves the Danish Maersk line, Atlantic Container Line of
Sweden, Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and DSR-Senator Joint service, Dutch Nedlloyd
Lijnen, P&amp;O Containers of Britain, Swiss Mediterranean Shipping and Polish
Ocean Lines. Others are Korean Cho Yang Shipping, Hong Kong's Orient
Overseas Container Line, Singapore's NOL, Japan's NYK, and Sea Land Services
of the US.
One official said the case was sensitive because EC action against Maersk
could touch a raw nerve in the run-up to Denmark's referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on May 18.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on side-accords for the proposed North American Free Trade Agreements
showed signs of progress yesterday as differences appeared to narrow between
the three countries - Mexico, Canada and the US.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, chief US negotiator, confirmed that Washington was not
pursuing an ambitious side-agreement on controlling import surges. The
existing Nafta chapter on such safeguards would not be reopened. Instead,
the US was looking for ways to improve consultation and procedures in the
detection of surges.
Likewise, Mr Yerxa seemingly confirmed recent reports that the US would not
push for the establishment of special commissions with direct powers to
penalise violators of labour and environmental laws.
He said he thought there a 'distinction to be drawn between the powers that
a supranational commission itself would have and the enforceability of
commitments the three governments undertake to ensure enforcement of their
laws.'
The side-agreements on labour, the environment and import surges have been
demanded by the Clinton administration before it submits Nafta, formally
signed last December, to the US Congress.
While the administration, under pressure from a Congress with doubts about
Nafta, is committed to mechanisms that would enforce these agreements on
labour and the environment, Mexico and Canada are concerned that such rules
would violate their sovereignty and become tools of protectionism.
Mr Yerxa said that the three sides had to 'overcome differences over what
might be the best means to achieve the objectives' of the side-agreements -
that was to protect the environment and labour rights in the North American
economy. He left open the possibility that the three sides would not reach
agreement.

FT  16 APR 93 / Prospect of hung jury looms over LA trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JURORS yesterday ended without a decision their sixth day of deliberations
in the trial of four white Los Angeles police officers charged with
violating the civil rights of a black motorist, Mr Rodney King, in a beating
incident that was recorded on videotape.
Fears that the illness of one of the jurors on Wednesday might delay a
verdict in the closely watched trial proved unfounded as all 12 jurors
returned to the federal courthouse yesterday morning.
However, there was rising speculation that the jury might be having
difficulty in reaching a consensus on the civil rights charges and that the
two-month trial could end with a hung jury on some of the charges.
The officer's acquittal 12 months ago in a state court, where they were
charged with using excessive force in the arrest of Mr King, sparked riots
in Los Angeles and exposed to world-wide attention some of the city's most
deprived districts, including South Central Los Angeles, an area that few of
the city's affluent residents, and most of its many visitors, ever see.
The scene of some of the worst violence in last year's riots, South Central
is the focus of attention once more. There are widespread fears that it
might again erupt in burning and looting if the men are acquitted. Police,
the national guard and US marines at nearby Camp Pendleton are all preparing
for the worst.
Yet on the streets of South Central there is an eerie calm. The area seemed
to have been almost deserted yesterday, with few people on the streets and
only light traffic.
Everywhere the ugly hulks of last year's fires remain. Many burnt-out
buildings have been torn down, the empty lots surrounded by fences scrawled
with graffiti - the trademark of local gangs.
At intersections there are vacant lots where petrol stations once stood. It
was at one such that Mr Reginald Denny, a truck driver, was dragged from his
cab and brutally beaten in the full view of television cameras.
Most depressing are the blocks and blocks of tiny boarded-up, metal-barred
shops and businesses, most of them closed since last year's riots. Of those
that remain in business, most seem to have been fortified and closed.
Yet only yards away, on the side streets of South Central, life goes on
behind locked and grilled doors in row upon row of tiny bungalows. For most
residents of this ethnically mixed community, there is no escape. As
businesses close, unemployment rises, and property values decline. In
Crenshaw, known as one of the toughest parts of the city, the bungalows give
way to four-storey apartment buildings and a large shopping centre.
Although there are fewer visible signs of last year's riots in this part of
the city, it was the scene of numerous shootings and large-scale looting of
department stores and supermarkets. Further north, in Korea Town, target of
attacks by roving gangs a year ago, uniformed security guards now stand on
the pavement outside fortified electronics shops. Additional metal grids are
being installed over the windows of other shops.
The heavy police presence, so widely publicised by city officials, is not
visible in these parts of Los Angeles. In two hours of touring, this
reporter saw only four squad cars - moving in pairs - as well as a few
'undercover' police, not very well disguised, in unmarked cars, apparently
going about their business of searching for drug dealers.
While the 12 jurors in the Rodney King beating trial continue their
deliberations in the federal court downtown, it is on the streets of South
Central, Crenshaw, Korea Town and other poor neighbourhoods of Los Angeles
that the verdict on civil rights and social injustice will ultimately be
cast.
The efforts of community leaders - black, Asian and hispanic - may be
successful in preventing an uprising of the devastating proportions seen a
year ago. More pragmatically, people who live in South Central say simply:
'There is nothing left to burn.'

FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: US trade barriers criticised - European
report pinpoints discrimination against foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US rhetoric about free trade contrasts with its own significant barriers to
trade and investment, according to a new study by the European Commission
released yesterday.
The Commission's annual report on US trade barriers pinpoints protectionist
trade legislation, discrimination against foreign investors, high tariffs
and 'Buy American' laws in the US. 'The number of such impediments has not
decreased since last year's report was published,' the study concludes.
The 90-page Commission study comes as Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for
external economic relations, is preparing to visit Washington for talks
early next week with the Clinton administration. The aim is to head off US
sanctions in the dispute over US/EC procurement legislation and to make
progress in the Gatt world trade talks.
A Commission spokesman stressed yesterday that criticism of US trade
practices did not amount to proof that the new Democratic administration was
more protectionist than its Republican predecessor. 'We continue to give
them the benefit of the doubt.'
The chief barriers cited in the report are:
US tariffs of 20-50 per cent on textiles, ceramics, glassware, vegetables
and footwear.
'Buy American' legislation at federal and state level which shuts out
foreign suppliers, or sets down local content requirements of 50-65 per
cent. Telecommunications equipment remains excluded from the Gatt
procurement code.
Unilateral US legislation such as the 'Super 301' law which, though lapsed,
may be revived by the US Congress. The clause provides wide discretion to
retaliate against trading practices deemed unfair or burdensome to US
commerce.
New extra-territorial legislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act (1992)
which restricts trade with Cuba to humanitarian and food aid operations. It
also extends to US-owned or controlled foreign companies.
The US failure to renew favourable tariffs on dozens of farm and industrial
products valued at Dollars 1.27bn (Pounds 841m). Some of the duties
currently applicable are as high as 38 per cent, the report says.
Mr Ove Jorgensen, the Commission's North America director, said yesterday
most of the Dollars 200bn annual two-way trade was 'largely trouble-free'.
The report however raises concerns about the new US preoccupation with
national economic security - an apparent shift from the old national
security considerations often used to justify trade barriers.

<TEXT>
FIAT'S subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina are planning a cross-border
venture to build a replacement for its Uno compact model, currently made in
both countries.
Mr Franco Macri, whose Argentine company Sevel builds Fiats and Peugeots
under licence, said planning was still at a very early stage.
However, the new project already figured in Fiat's L40bn (Pounds 16m)
long-term investment planning up to the year 2000. Fiat owns its Brazilian
subsidiary outright, but only 15 per cent of Sevel.
Production will maximise available industrial capacity in Argentina and
Brazil. The two companies will buy components from suppliers on both sides
of the frontier, and to a lesser extent from elsewhere.
As well as selling in Brazil and Argentina, the car would be exported to
Italy and other markets. Both countries' car industries have developed
strong trade links in recent years. Sevel already swaps vehicles, motors and
gearboxes with Brazil and its parent company's factories in the rest of the
world.

FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: US tires of waiting for bite of Japanese
apple market
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'EMPTY boxes, empty promises' reads a sign hanging from empty apple crates
displayed at an American food fair in Osaka this week. The display by the
Washington Apple Commission, which represents growers producing 60 per cent
of the US apple crop, reflects mounting frustration at Japan's reluctance to
open its market.
Although Japan officially liberalised this market in 1971, it has been
rejecting imports through strict quarantine rules about pests and diseases.
Such import restrictions are viewed as a structural trade barrier by foreign
agricultural exporters, although the Japanese contend the matter is purely
technical.
The US took action to meet Japan's rules for pest control in 1975. However,
after 18 years of waiting, it is accusing Japan of dragging its feet. Last
week, the US embassy in Tokyo filed an official complaint claiming the
technical aspects had been resolved and that Japan's slow processing was a
non-tariff barrier.
'Apples are symbolic of Japan's attitude,' says Mr Tom Hale, president of
the Washington state group. 'We've been patient and thorough with the
Japanese, and it's not a matter of science any more, but of politics.' The
US wants the market open by next January.
The US has spent considerable sums trying to meet Japanese requirements for
controlling the codling moth pest and fireblight disease. However, when the
US Agriculture Department sent data on treatments, Japan then raised concern
about another pest.
A Japanese official warned the US not to treat the matter as a trade issue.
'We still haven't received a proper explanation from the US why it does not
allow Japan to export mandarins to orange-producing American states,' he
said.

THE US may announce its backing for the bio-diversity convention, which it
refused to sign at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, as early as
next week, according to US officials.
President Bill Clinton is expected to deliver a speech on environmental
policy next Wednesday, and some officials believe he may be ready by then to
announce the US's intention to sign the convention, which lays down
obligations to list, monitor and protect endangered species.
But the US wants to add an interpretative statement to its signature,
clarifying its view of ambiguities in the treaty on intellectual property
and financing mechanisms, and is keen to have the European Community and
other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
sign on to this statement.
The treaty is open for signature until June 3.
White House environmental advisers last week gave a list of concerns to Mr
Svend Auken of Denmark, the current president of the EC council of
environment ministers, and are circulating a draft interpretative statement
they hope other governments might sign.
Many developed countries share US concerns about the vagueness of the treaty
language, and the EC had been planning to lodge its own statement.
Nevertheless, some of the proposed US language will need reworking if it is
to attract support.
At the heart of the US objections was the possibility that ambiguities in
the treaty could weaken the intellectual property rights of biotechnology
companies by forcing them to share the benefits of their research and
patents with the countries in which they found genetic material.
The US also objected to what it saw as an open-ended commitment to fund
bio-diversity protection in developing countries.

FT  16 APR 93 / Soaring dollar hopes come down to earth: Why the currency
has failed to live up to forex dealers' expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY FOREIGN exchange dealers predicted that this would be the year of the
soaring dollar. But, nearly four months into 1993, investors in the US
currency are still waiting for it to make its next big move upwards.
Last September, the dollar hit a historic low of 1.3860 against the D-Mark,
the world's second most traded currency. In the next four months, it rose
some 29 pfennigs against the German currency, boosted by the election of
President Bill Clinton and a sharp upturn in the US economy.
But New Year predictions that the dollar would break through the DM1.70
level by April have been dashed. Yesterday, it was trading at around
DM1.5970, some two pfennigs below its level at the start of January - and
some people in the currency market are predicting that it will go even
lower.
'The dollar is at an interesting turning point,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, an
economist at UBS in London. 'At these levels, fund managers are comfortable
holding dollars. But if the currency were to slip further from here, we
could see a large scale shedding of their dollar positions.'
The dollar has been capped because short-term interest rates in the US
remain nearly 5 percentage points below those in Germany, providing a
smaller return for investors in the US currency. This makes it expensive for
investors to hold dollars for long.
Several factors have ensured that this differential has remained so wide.
Growth in the US economy was more sluggish than expected in the first
quarter of this year. Currency investors bought dollars in large quantities
at the start of the year following US gross domestic product growth in the
fourth quarter of 1992 at an annualised 4.7 per cent. The comparable figure
for the first quarter of this year is expected to be down to 3 per cent.
This slowdown in growth suggests that the Federal Reserve will refrain from
raising interest rates in the near term.
The Bundesbank's cuts in official interest rates have been more modest than
expected. Germany's discount rate has been reduced by 75 basis points so far
this year. But the central bank has cut rates in 'salami-sized slices'
rather than introducing the aggressive easing of policy that had been
foreseen.
The yen, the third most traded currency in the world, has risen to historic
highs against the dollar in recent weeks amid speculation that Japanese
leaders would promote a strong yen to reduce the country's huge trade
surplus with the US. The new Japanese fiscal package of Y13,200bn announced
this week has led to a slight strengthening of the dollar in recent days,
however, in the belief that the package will help to reduce Japan's trade
surplus.
There is speculation that the Bundesbank is selling dollars on the foreign
exchange market as a means of rebalancing its reserves. The Bundesbank
acquired an estimated Dollars 20bn in foreign currencies during last
autumn's crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. These funds are thought to
be being sold back to the market, supporting the D-Mark.
Views differ sharply over whether the US currency will go up or down from
here.
Mr Persaud of UBS believes the dollar has bottomed out at its current level
and that it will be at around DM1.63 by the end of the month.
He believes US growth will look increasingly favourable compared to that of
Germany. He also thinks that the Bundesbank has proved that it will cut
rates for domestic reasons, and that this is a good augury for more policy
easing.
However, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in
London, believes there is some chance that the dollar could move as low as
DM1.30. He points to 'disturbingly weak' US money supply growth and poor
consumer confidence figures as signs that the economic slowdown is set to
continue.
He also believes that the current holding of Dollars 500bn of reserves by
the world's central banks is far more than is justified by the economic
performance of the US; and that a reaffirmation of French and German central
banking ties in Europe could lead to greater cross-holdings of francs and
D-Marks by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France.
'In these circumstances, there would be little point in major central banks
continuing to have such large holdings of US dollars,' he said.

THE North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Canada and Mexico,
could run into difficulties in the US House of Representatives, Mr Julius
Katz, former deputy US trade representative, said yesterday in London.
President Bill Clinton would need to persuade his party, the Democrats, to
accept the key measures on labour and the environment, particularly on the
US-Mexico front. The second round of talks on such issues has been going on
this week in Mexico City.
Nevertheless, Mr Katz, who now works as a trade consultant for his former
boss, Mrs Carla Hills, the erstwhile US trade representative, told a
conference that Nafta, signed last December, 'represents one of the most
important achievements of the Bush administration'. It would be 'of great
significance to the further development of the Mexican economy'.
Mr Katz said that at the outset of the Bush administration priority had been
given to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Bilateral free
trade agreements 'were second order priorities'.
The initiative taken by President Carlos Salinas in February 1990 to join
Nafta had been his, not that of the US. It had been motivated by the
development of the European Community's Single Market and growing attention
to the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe.
Nafta, because of its health and cleanliness provisions in particular, had
been described as 'the greenest' trade agreement ever negotiated, he said.
He saw continuity in US trade policy under the Clinton administration in
that there had been commitment to negotiate with Chile to expand Nafta.
But, he said, 'a more immediate problem for President Clinton is to secure
the approval of Nafta by the Congress, something which is widely assumed,
but is not assured.'

FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: East Europe calls EC's bluff over free
trade - Community proposals are short on specifics where it matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING this week's international conference in Copenhagen on economic
development in central and eastern Europe, ministers from the former
communist bloc served notice on the EC that it was time to put up or shut
up.
Dropping diplomatic niceties, the east Europeans pressed hard for further
trade liberalisation with the EC and early membership of the Community. Mr
Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, compared their struggle to that
of ancient gladiators fighting wild beasts in the Circus Maximus in front of
an indifferent (western) Caesar.
The Community's response was less dramatic. Looking sheepish, Mr Niels
Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, trotted out the standard EC line
that there was no point in setting a firm date on membership. Other free
trade-minded delegations pledged to dismantle trade barriers, but were short
on specifics where it matters most: agriculture, fertilisers, steel and
textiles.
It was left to Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic
relations, to raise the free trade flag. He warned western ministers not to
use the recession as an excuse for delaying trade concessions, saying the EC
enjoyed a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 861m) trade surplus with the chief east and
central European economies of the former Soviet bloc.
Sir Leon is eastern Europe's standard-bearer in the battle for accelerated
trade liberalisation to be considered at the EC summit in Copenhagen in
June. Political steam for a more generous approach is building - if only
because at some point the EC will have to confront the contradiction between
its political desire to help the former communist countries and the economic
reality that so far its concessions on market access have been niggardly.
There are signs of a new approach. In Copenhagen, several western
delegations said it was time for the eastern Europeans to rebuild commercial
ties among themselves and with the former Soviet republics as part of a
grand design to strengthen trade liberalisation across the continent,
including eventually Russia.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, the new French minister for European affairs, said
greater commercial integration in the east would offset the loss of markets
caused by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, but it would also serve a broader
aim: to teach the east Europeans 'la vie communautaire', just as France and
Germany learnt to overcome their old enmities after the second world war.
More bluntly, Mr Lamassoure spoke of the 'absurd paradox' that east
Europeans were demanding free trade with the west while continuing to put
barriers to trade with their eastern neighbours.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, British foreign minister, was more cautious.
Regional co-operation was no substitute for market access to the EC, but it
made sense to forge closer trade links between the Visegrad Four  - Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - and Romania and Bulgaria. 'Ways
too should be found to revitalise trade with neighbouring states in the
former Soviet Union.'
Yet all the east European countries are wary of being pushed back into the
orbit of the former Soviet Union. Their fears are not only political. Mr
Jeszenszky, colourful as ever, recalled that Lada car models built with Fiat
spare parts in the east bloc never worked properly. East-west trade was
simply superior to east-east trade, he said.
Nor is it clear how Mr Lamassoure's ideas fit into the new patterns of trade
which have sprung up since the fall of the Berlin Wall: the EC's single
market, the European Economic Area (between the EC and Efta countries); free
trade agreements between Efta and the Visegrad Four, between the Visegrads
themselves, and between the EC and the six 'associate' EC countries
(Bulgaria, Romania, and the Visegrad Four).
Confusing the picture still further, the Baltic states have free trade
agreements with Norway, Sweden, and Finland but not with the EC - a tricky
subject which remains to be tackled during the Nordic countries' accession
negotiations to the EC this year.
The eastern European queue for membership is equally tangled. By extending
association agreements to Bulgaria and Romania, the EC has offered the same
privileges to the Visegrad Four and undermined its claim to be a privileged
club. At the same time, the aggressively free-market Czech republic is
sprinting ahead; Slovenia, the former Yugoslav republic, is also making
rapid progress. Germany is quietly pushing both countries' cause.
EC leaders will soon have to offer clearer priorities, even if this
conflicts with the ad-hoc approach favoured by the Community. In the
meantime, it is clear that the east Europeans are less willing to play a
supplicant role toward their rich western neighbours. The EC's temporary ban
on meat and dairy products because of suspected foot and mouth disease in
the region unleashed prompt retaliation and howls of rage in Copenhagen.
Mr Pavel Bratinka, Czech foreign minister, noting that there had been no
foot and mouth disease in his country since 1974, uttered what could be a
prophetic warning: 'From now on, the almost automatic support given hitherto
by the Czech republic to anything bearing the label EC will exist no more.'

ARGENTINA is to begin privatising YPF, its national oil company, in June or
July, instead of October as planned.
YPF's net worth is estimated at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) and is to be
floated on local and international equity markets. The sale will be the
country's biggest privatisation.
Mr Daniel Marx, Argentina's chief financial negotiator, said yesterday: 'We
feel the opportunity (of) markets being receptive generally to stocks,
particularly oil and Latin American stocks. The stars have not been aligned
like this for a long time.'
He denied the new timing was due to domestic political factors or to
worsening government cash-flow. He said the privatisation's detailed
planning and marketing strategy would have to await appointment of advisers.
However, he said the government had already decided to sell as much of the
company as quickly as possible. It holds 100 per cent of YPF stock and is
legally required to retain a 20 per cent stake.

liberalisation

<TEXT>
INDIAN industrial organisations yesterday welcomed government moves to
liberalise investment in the motor, white goods and leather industries.
The measures, which were announced late on Wednesday, are a significant
extension of the economic reforms of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, who is trying to deregulate the economy and integrate it with the
global trading network.
The changes will permit companies, including foreign groups, to enter the
motor, white goods and leather industries without the need for government
licences which, until recently, have been used to limit competition and keep
out foreign competitors.
The Confederation of Indian Industry said yesterday that the measures were a
step in the right direction.
However, they are unlikely to prompt an immediate rush into the
newly-liberalised sectors, since much of Indian industry has been suffering
from weak demand for the past year.
Foreign car makers have held talks with Indian vehicle makers, but have yet
to commit themselves to any large projects until the outlook for the economy
is clearer. They have also been held back by the global economic slow down.
In separate moves, the government approved state-sector investments
totalling Rs35bn (Pounds 737m), including the expansion of import facilities
for natural gas, the modernisation of the Digoil refinery in Assam, power
station construction, and the building of a new passenger terminal at Bombay
airport.
Ministers also approved the award of an oil and gas exploration contract for
an onshore area in Gujarat, north western India, to a consortium of US,
Australian and Indian companies.
A parliamentary Committee probing the Rs40bn Bombay securities market
scandal is considering recommending tough penalties for foreign banks
involved in the affair.
According to the Economic Times, India's leading business daily, the
committee's draft report recommends that the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank, should consider banning the offending banks from repatriating
profits earned from irregular transactions. The committee's final report is
due to be published next month.
The scandal erupted when fake and unrecorded transactions were discovered in
the inter-bank securities market.
Investigators established that money had been siphoned out of the market in
contravention of central bank rules for investment in the stock market.
Four foreign banks were found to have been particularly active in the
securities market - Citibank and Bank of America of the US, ANZ Grindlays of
Australia and the UK's Standard Chartered.

<TEXT>
THE Central Bank of Nigeria has withdrawn its 90-day moratorium on payment
of all letters of credit, a ruling introduced on March 1 which drew strong
criticism from the business community and damaged Nigeria's credibility with
foreign suppliers.
A circular issued by the central bank says that payment for transactions
under confirmed and irrevocable letters of credit at sight is again
permissible.
The change of policy is back-dated to March 1 enabling suppliers to be
credited without further delay.
The private sector in Nigeria has welcomed the decision, which is seen as an
admission of error by the bank.
One banker said: 'The 90-day rule showed a serious lack of understanding of
commercial procedures on the part of leading central bankers.'
The bank's justification for the 90-day ruling in March was to stop abuses
of the exchange rate system.
Bankers believe that the real motive was to delay payment of scarce hard
currency for as long as possible.
The effect was quite different, as importers in Nigeria bore the 90 days
financing costs, passed on by their suppliers, resulting in higher import
prices.
The only beneficiaries of the bank's previous ruling were the suppliers'
banks, outside Nigeria, who were able to have use of the money for an extra
90 days.
The central bank has yet to reverse last month's the other directive in
March which blocked payment of an estimated Dollars 1bn to suppliers who
have allowed Nigerian importers delayed payment terms.

FT  16 APR 93 / Kenyans suspend operations of leading local bank

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA HAS suspended operations of a leading local bank hit by severe cash
problems and arrested several of its officials, the state-run Kenya News
Agency said yesterday.
The agency quoted Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, as saying the
central bank had taken over the affairs of the Trade Bank of Kenya pending
further investigations.
In a statement last month the minister denied allegations that several banks
had been allowed by the central bank to run up overdrafts because of their
connections with the political establishment.
Mr Mudavadi acknowledged that a 'few banks have run overdrafts with the
Central Bank,' but he stressed that they were not insolvent.
Yesterday Mr Mudavadi told the Kenyan parliament that 'auditors appointed to
the bank had reported liquidity constraints, poor asset quality, weak
internal controls and violations of the banking act.'
He said that a manager from the Central Bank had been appointed to run the
trade bank, owned by a group of powerful local Asians 'in order to protect
depositors and creditors and restore public confidence,' Kenya News Agency
reported.
It said several trade bank officials had been arrested. The Asian managing
director was being sought.
An opposition member of parliament told the house on Wednesday that the
central bank was forced to loan the trade bank up to Sh1.6bn (Pounds 23m) to
enable the bank to pay off its debts.
The bank was set up in 1984 with a paid-up capital of Sh230m. It listed cash
reserves of up to Sh212m in February this year.

A CONSORTIUM of companies led by Australia's BHP Petroleum signed contracts
yesterday to exploit Vietnam's Dai Hung (Big Bear) offshore oil field, the
biggest undeveloped field in Asia, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
The contract, calling for total investment of about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
966m) over more than 20 years, is one of the biggest business deals in
communist Vietnam since it started building a market economy in the late
1980s.
BHP Petroleum is the operator for the field, about 250 km (155 miles) off
the coast of southern Vietnam, with a 43.75 per cent stake.
Its partners are Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, with 20 per cent,
VietsovPetro, a Vietnamese-Russian joint venture, with 15 per cent, and
Total of France and Sumitomo of Japan with 10.625 per cent each.
Bringing the Big Bear field on stream in mid-1994 will boost Vietnam's oil
exports, currently coming from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field further
north. VietsovPetro pumped about 5m tonnes of crude from Bach Ho last year.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA was yesterday counting the political and economic cost of
Wednesday's national protest strike which left 17 people dead.
Yesterday an angry mob attacked two whites in the black homeland of Transkei
less than 48 hours after the slaying of two white South African tourists,
police said.
The death toll from Wednesday's protest rose to 17 after 11 people were
massacred in Natal province following a commemoration rally for slain
African National Congress leader Chris Hani.
However, it was not clear how closely the deaths were related to the ANC
protest, given that such massacres have become a regular occurrence in
Natal.
There were further violent incidents in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and on the
East Rand near Johannesburg. The black township of Soweto was reported
quiet.
Further mass protests are planned for tomorrow, Sunday and Monday, raising
the risk of further violence.
The ANC has called another national protest strike for Monday, the day Mr
Hani will be buried.
Yesterday it appeared the political impact of the Hani assassination might
prove positive, as the South African government announced it would drop
crucial preconditions to the establishment of the first phase of a
multi-racial interim government, the Transitional Executive Council.
The council would include representatives of all the main parties, and would
have sub-councils to advise and monitor government actions in areas such as
law and order, defence, finance and foreign affairs.
Mr Roelf Meyer, the ANC's chief negotiator, said the government would no
longer insist that the 26 parties to the multi-party negotiating forum agree
a transitional constitution before this council could be formed. This
removes a big obstacle to formation of the Council, which Mr Meyer said
could be agreed by May.
However, he cautioned that some parties, such as the Inkatha Freedom Party,
might object, causing further delays. Inkatha believes there should be no
extended transition to full democracy.
Meanwhile, the US state department advised Americans to stay away from black
homelands and townships in South Africa. Transkei leader Major-General Bantu
Holomisa said armed police were being sent to protect tourists in the
homeland's popular coastal resorts, but South Africans were advised to avoid
Transkei.
Ms Michelle Cohen, executive director of the US chamber of commerce, said
she knew of businessmen, representing US companies which stuck with South
Africa through sanctions, curtailing visits to the country because of the
turmoil.
She expected a hefty rise in the cost of insurance on trade with South
Africa. 'We'll be on the same list as Vietnam. . . Sarajevo.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Doubts on aid disbursement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AID package announced by the Group of Seven ministers yesterday gave a
strong message of western support to Russia, but it may not have removed the
obstacles to aid disbursement.
Mr David Roche, head of global strategy at Morgan Stanley International,
said that only between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 6bn would be available
relatively quickly.
'This is far short of the mega sums in the plan's headlines,' he said.
'Just as hyperinflation is part of the Russian scene, so hyperbole is a part
of the western aid package to save Yeltsin.'
This assessment was borne out by economic commentators in Moscow.
One said that the package risked duplicating the mistake made last year,
when the headline sum of Dollars 24bn remained partly unspent because of IMF
conditionality, and the remainder - about half - was given in the form of
tied credits, further increasing the overall Russian debt.
As these funds went in, an estimated Dollars 15bn-Dollars 25bn was illegally
squirrelled away by Russian companies and individuals in western bank
accounts.
Further, the success of the package is, as ever, dependent on the politics
within Russia.
Only if Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, wins the referendum on
April 25 and, more important, acts on that victory by giving the go-ahead to
his government to restrain credit and create the conditions for a stable
currency, can the 'black hole' of Russian reform be closed and the reforms
be implemented.

FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Something old, something new for
embattled Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue,
the finance and foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised
nations yesterday pulled together a package of financial support for Russia
with the impressive price tag of Dollars 43bn.
The package to bolster Russian economic reforms has three main components.
About Dollars 14bn has been earmarked for macro-economic stabilisation,
particularly to help bring inflation under control. A similar amount will be
spent on structural reform, mainly trade assistance, aid to develop the
energy sector and small and medium-sized businesses. About Dollars 15bn will
be debt rescheduling.
The package thrashed out during two days of talks at a Tokyo hotel dwarfs
the much derided Dollars 24bn plan agreed last year. It is on top of
bilateral commitments of more than Dollars 4bn announced during the meeting
by the US, Japan and the UK.
According to the plan's authors it is designed to deliver practical and
visible help to hard-pressed Russian consumers and unemployed workers who
are bearing the brunt of the dislocations of reform.
With President Boris Yeltsin preparing for a critical referendum on his
political reform plans on April 25, the G7 leaders yesterday claimed to have
met the historic challenge they set themselves, to throw their weight and
money decisively behind the embattled Russian leader.
Yet, on closer inspection, the G7's achievements are less impressive than
they seem. The new multilateral money committed in Tokyo was well short of
Dollars 43bn. The immediate benefits for men and women in Russian streets
will be even less.
Much of the package drawn up in Tokyo was already in the pipeline. The
Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling had already been agreed by 19 creditor
countries in Paris on April 2.
About Dollars 10bn is in the form of export credits, much of which G7
countries have already offered bilaterally. A further Dollars 10bn is in the
form of a Dollars 4bn IMF standby loan and a Dollars 6bn rouble
stabilisation fund. These loans were offered last year but not taken up. The
G7 is simply reaffirming that the facilities are still available.
About Dollars 5bn is due to come from World Bank loans to promote structural
reform in industry. Many of these loans have been under negotiation for
months.
So the only new multilateral initiatives taken by the G7 in the past two
days amount to Dollars 3.3bn. The main element is an innovative Dollars 3bn
IMF loan dubbed a systemic transformation facility designed to help
economies undergoing sweeping reform.
The remainder is a Dollars 300m European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development fund to promote the development of small businesses, in part
through planning a Russian bank for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Indeed the boldest initiative, a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn fund to
promote large-scale privatisation, met a cool response. Ministers agreed to
study the idea in the run-up to the July G7 summit of heads of state.
The protagonists, including Russia's Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime
minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, dismissed such
calculations of their achievements as crude underestimates. They make four
main claims for the Tokyo agreement:
It marks a more credible western commitment to the process of reform. The
special Dollars 3bn IMF facility - which is conditional on Russian pledges
that it will tackle inflation and reduce its budget deficit - is designed to
kick-start macro-economic stabilisation.
That should make it easier for Russia to negotiate the Dollars 4bn stand-by
arrangement with the IMF. The meeting set an October deadline for concluding
those talks. As Mr Fyodorov remarked: 'This puts us in a stronger bargaining
position with the IMF.'
If the stand-by arrangement is agreed Russia will be in a better position to
take up the additional Dollars 6bn IMF rouble stabilisation fund.
The G7 will make it easier for Russia to take up assistance from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank.
The west is adopting a more practical approach in an effort to make sure aid
makes a tangible and visible difference to everyday life in Russia. The main
symbol of that is the small business fund. As Mr Fyodorov put it: 'The whole
process is better co-ordinated and more practical then before.'
According to the Russians, the political value of the G7 being seen pulling
together its support into a single package at such a critical time should
not be underestimated.
In time, Mr Kozyrev's desire that ordinary citizens should see some of the
fruits of foreign assistance in their daily lives may come true. In the
meantime the main effect of the Tokyo talks on daily Russian life will be
the headlines generated in this morning's newspapers.

WHEN Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russian deputy premier, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
foreign minister, took the stage at the end of the two-day Group of Seven
meeting, they were convinced Russia had done well from the gathering.
Mr Kozyrev suggested that the get-together was evidence that 'democratic
forces on both sides won the cold war', although that assertion will be put
to the test by the Russian referendum on April 25, a date which inspired the
hurriedly arranged meeting.
That date was also on the mind of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, who explained that 'we simply could not wait for our annual summit in
July to act decisively on behalf of the reform government in Moscow.' If the
'forces of reform' were to be defeated, he said, 'we would face increased
instability' and the 'necessity to continue to invest dollars in defence of
and not in the urgent domestic needs of our people'.
Mr Kozyrev said the aid programme would certainly help the 'day-to-day
lives' of the Russian people, and suggested the international support shown
for Mr Yeltsin would 'give him more authority and more strength'.
Mr Fyodorov said the aid programme was now better linked to the economic
reforms under way in Russia. He said the support promised for small business
was 'very important', as were the 'clear mechanisms' for the implementation
of the aid programme.
His reference to 'clear mechanisms' reflects Russian disappointment that
funds from past programmes have been slow to flow because of international
agencies' strict conditions.
He also cautioned that some detail was yet to be determined: 'There are many
aspects which will require further study. There is much more detail to be
decided.'
Mr Fyodorov said it was understandable that a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.6bn) privatisation fund was not immediately supported by other G7
countries. The fund is designed to help big companies, and the US has
pledged Dollars 500m and expects fellow G7 members to supply at least
Dollars 1.5bn.
'The question of privatisation will be analysed. By the time of the G7
summit in July we will have a better idea of whether it will be supported,'
Mr Fyodorov said.
US officials also said they were not disheartened by the unenthusiastic
response to the privatisation proposal, but made clear the US would be
disappointed if its G7 partners failed to commit funds by the time of the
summit.

France's commercial banks plan to oppose attempts to reschedule Russia's
Dollars 20bn private debt until the Russian financial system is more stable
and corruption has been curbed, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris.
French banks, which account for between Dollars 3.7bn and Dollars 4.6bn of
Russia's private debt, will put their case this weekend to the London Club
meeting of western banks. Gallic banks with heaviest exposure are Credit
Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale.
Mr Michel Freyche, president of the French banking association, said they
would not agree to Russian proposals that commercial lenders should
reschedule loans along the same lines as official creditors agreed earlier
this month with their Dollars 38bn debt. He said they should wait until
proper exchange controls were in place and corruption stamped out.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia changed gear sharply yesterday in his
lackadaisical campaign to win backing for his presidency in a referendum on
April 25.
He told a meeting of supporters he would not obey the rules for the
referendum set by his rivals in the Russian parliament, and he ordered a
drastic cut in the privileges and duties of his rebellious vice president
General Alexander Rutskoi.
He also named Mr Oleg Lobov - a trusted associate who is close to industrial
enterprise managers - as first deputy premier to oversee the economy, in a
move designed to reassure the important industrial lobby. Mr Lobov outranks
deputy premier Boris Fyodorov, who is in charge of economic reform.
At the same time, Mr Yeltstin is working on a decree which would give
massive privileges to Russia's autonomous republics in exchange for their
support in the campaign. The decree would convert the Russian federation
into a confederation, with each of the 21 separate republics acceding to a
new union treaty in a distinctly different way.
The referendum rules set by parliament lay down that any proposition needs
to be approved by more than 50 per cent of the total electorate - an all but
impossible margin. But Mr Yeltsin said he would issue a decree on April 20
to bring these rules into line with the referendum law, which lays down that
only a majority of those voting is required.
He said he had yesterday met Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the
Constitutional Court, to remind him that the court was due to issue a
judgment on the constitutionality of the referendum rules by April 20. Mr
Zorkin, whose pronouncements have become increasingly anti-presidential,
forecast on Wednesday night that Mr Yeltsin's determination to press ahead
with the introduction of a new constitution would bring civil war between
rightist and leftist forces. This came even though Mr Zorkin helped prepare
the draft constitution Mr Yeltsin wishes to introduce.
The president's move against Gen Rutskoi means the vice president's
armour-plated Mercedes has been replaced with a Volga, the middle managers'
workhorse; his bodyguards have been cut to two; and he is relieved of
responsibility for agricultural reforms - an area where, like so many of his
predecessors, he made little mark.
Gen Rutskoi, whose support was crucial to Mr Yeltsin on his accession to
power two years ago and who was chosen because of his military (air force)
background and influence among reformist communists, is now close to being
Mr Yeltsin's main contender for the presidency.
He is a powerful and emotional speaker, has a record of physical courage in
action and is the head of a relatively large party, the Free Russia party -
part of the Civic Union bloc.
Mr Yeltsin, still supported by the dwindling number of radical democrats in
the political class, appears to have plumped for the heads of republics
within Russia as the biggest source of his support. They have called on
voters to turn out on April 25 - though they refused to explicitly endorse
Mr Yeltsin - and they have agreed the referendum may go ahead in all of
their territories.

FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: West foresees more close co-operation -
Summit Communique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Introduction
At the request of heads of state and government of the seven major
industrialised countries and of the president of the EC Commission, and in
the process of preparation of the Tokyo summit, foreign and finance
ministers of G7 countries and representatives of the European Community met
in Tokyo April 14, 1993 to discuss support for reform in the Russian
Federation. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan opened the meeting,
which was chaired jointly by Mr Kabun Muto, minister for foreign affairs and
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, minister of finance.
On April 15 1993, the ministers met with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime
minister and finance minister of Russia, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign
minister, for an extended discussion of the economic and political situation
in Russia and to review how the international community could best support
Russia's reform programme. Our Russian colleagues reaffirmed the
determination of President Yeltsin and his government to move forward with
reform. They welcomed our determination to support the reform process.
2 Support for Russia's Reform
Russia has embarked on a far reaching transformation process with the aim of
building a democratic society, establishing a market economy and improving
the welfare of its people under the leadership of President Yeltsin.
Russia has made courageous and extraordinary progress in the last two years.
Russian reform and progress towards democratisation are essential to world
peace. We want to see a democratic, stable and economically strong Russia,
firmly integrated into the community of democratic states and into the world
economy. We are confident that the G7 and Russia will continue to co-operate
constructively and responsibly in international affairs.
The Russian people themselves must bear primary responsibility for economic
and political reform. The development of a market economy in Russia will be
a long, arduous undertaking which will require difficult adjustments by the
Russian people. We assure them of our support in coping with the inevitable
hardships of the transition period. We remain resolved to work with Russia
to develop lasting co-operation based on the principles of partnership and
help for self-help laid out at the Munich Summit. Our assistance will be
pragmatic, visible, tangible and effective, tailored to Russian absorptive
capacity and phased with the progress of reform.
We welcome the recognition by the Russian government that both monetary
stabilisation and further structural reform. including privatisation, are
critical. A positive environment for private initiatives and investment,
including a proper legal and administrative framework, is crucial for the
transformation of the economy. Better access to export markets is
indispensable to structural reform in Russia.
3 Bilateral and Multilateral Actions
We have agreed on a series of multilateral actions closely linked with our
bilateral efforts as described in the Annex. Close co-ordination among our
countries and international organisations as well as close contacts with the
Russian authorities will be necessary.
Russia is currently experiencing a particularly difficult situation. We are
also mindful of the challenging tasks facing other economies in transition.
The success of the Russian reform programme is in the interest of all
countries. . .
4. Next Steps
Our meeting in Tokyo has helped lay the foundation for the meeting to be
held with President Yeltsin in July in Tokyo. The heads of state and
government of the G7 democracies and the president of the EC Commission will
continue to pay close attention to developments in Russia. They look forward
to a fruitful review in July.

<TEXT>
TIGHT new rules on foreign banks intending to operate in Russia have been
published by the central bank, in a move seen as part of a policy to protect
fledgling Russian industries and financial institutions from foreign
competition.
Mr Dmitri Tulin, a central bank deputy chairman, said in an interview with
the Interfax agency that foreign banks could open only one branch office
besides their Russian head office, while the total capital of all foreign
banks operating in Russia could not exceed 12 per cent of the aggregate
capital of the Russian commercial banks this year.
Already, according to the central bank, aggregate capital of foreign banks
represents 6 per cent of the Russian total. This is even though only two
western banks - Z-Landerbank of Austria and Credit Lyonnais of France - have
received banking licences.
Mr Geert D'Haese, chief representative of the Inter Alpha Group of banks -
which include Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Belgium's Kredietbank and the
UK's Royal Bank of Scotland - said the rules were a compromise with
conservatives in the Russian parliament, who tried to ban foreign bank
operations entirely.

FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Moscow given notice on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven yesterday backed the Russian leadership of President
Boris Yeltsin and his reforms but also put Russia on notice that its full
support is expected in handling the conflict in Bosnia.
G7 foreign ministers attending the two-day meeting in Tokyo were agreed that
much tougher sanctions should be imposed on Serbia through the United
Nations unless there is a settlement in coming days.
The ministers made clear to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister,
that Moscow, a traditional ally of the Serbs, must use its influence to end
violence and should vote in favour of tougher sanctions if a vote is held at
the UN.
A UN vote has been delayed until after Russia's April 25 plebiscite as Mr
Yeltsin is under pressure from conservatives and could be embarrassed by a
vote in favour of action against the Serbs. In recent weeks, Russian
officials have said tougher sanctions would be 'unhelpful'.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the vote was delayed out
of deference to Russia and its apparent attempts to quell the violence, but
Moscow's full co-operation would be expected in the UN after April 25.
He said Russian officials had indicated a settlement may be possible and
insisted they must make genuine efforts to see it was reached. If there was
no settlement, he said, the US would vote for sanctions and Russia should
too.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Heading off into uncertainty - As the
corruption scandal deepens, Italians vote on Sunday to consider the first
steps to fundamental political reform. But the shape of this is unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Italians prepare to vote on Sunday in their country's latest referendums,
what was designed by its sponsors as a protest against the political
establishment has turned into a much more confused affair.
Of the eight separate referendums, two in particular should have been
barometers of the political mood in a country rocked by almost daily
revelations of political corruption and, more recently, allegations of
collusion between leading politicians and organised crime.
But since the proposal to reform the system for electing members of the
Senate, the upper house of parliament, was first mooted by Mr Mario Segni,
the breakaway Christian Democrat who has led the referendum movement, most
of the main political parties have jumped on the reform bandwagon.
Similarly, every political group in parliament has endorsed the referendum
calling for the abolition of state funding for parties. After the exposure
of massive kickbacks to politicians on a stream of public-sector contracts
in recent years, opposing the move would be little more than political
suicide. The alternative to the current system has not yet been outlined but
will have to offer greater transparency and be more rigidly enforceable.
By contrast, some smaller political parties are calling on their supporters
to oppose the call for electoral reform. Their arguments are based on
principle, but with a strong element of self-preservation.
Sunday's referendum only calls on voters to voice their opinion on replacing
the electoral system in the Senate, the upper house of parliament. The
present method, based on proportional representation, would make way for one
whereby 238 of the 315 seats in the Senate would be elected by a majority
vote. It is expected that backing for the change will oblige politicians to
extend the reform to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house.
Less certain is the type of majority voting system politicians will prefer
when it comes to approving a replacement.
According to the opponents of change, shifting to an electoral system based
on a majority vote will strengthen the position of established parties, such
as the Christian Democrats, which have traditionally blocked change in Italy
and are now being revealed as deeply involved in the corruption scandals.
Hence opponents of the referendum, such as La Rete, the small party headed
by Mr Leoluca Orlando, the former mayor of Palermo, and a majority of the
environmentalist Green lobby, say the call for electoral reform is
counter-productive, as it will only enshrine the entrenched position of the
bigger parties, while smaller groups militating for reform will be penalised
in future polls. The opponents of referendum say new elections should be
held now, rather than waiting for a new system to be introduced by a
parliament they claim largely composed of parties shown to be corrupt.
A sizeable Yes vote in favour of reforming the electoral system and party
financing is no longer in doubt after polling booths shut on Monday
afternoon. How politicians will react remains uncertain.
Before the parties backed the two main issues, it was widely expected that
the 'protest' registered by the referendum would trigger the formation of a
new government. The latter, probably headed by an 'institutional' figure
such as the leader of the upper or lower house of parliament, would have
remained in office just long enough to steer through electoral reform.
Once the changes were approved, it was assumed the caretaker government
would call early elections, probably for September. That would allow voters
to elect a parliament, based on the new rules, which would reflect popular
opinion and be better placed to push through tough economic measures.
However, the prospect of an 'institutional' post-referendum government has
waned in recent weeks after growing signs of friction between the Christian
Democrats, the biggest political party, and the Democratic Party of the Left
(PDS), the former Communists.
Earlier this month, the two parties, which would form the main elements of
an 'institutional' post-referendum coalition, appeared unable to agree on
sharing power. The likely price for support by the PDS - having the
government led by Mr Giorgio Napolitano - appeared too high for the
Christian Democrats. Mr Napolitano is the leader of the Chamber of Deputies
and a PDS politician. Meanwhile, the PDS appeared unwilling to back a more
broadly-based government unless strongly represented.
Given the impasse, it now looks more likely that Mr Giuliano Amato, the
Socialist prime minister, will soldier on. It will be up to his tarnished
coalition, which has seen the departure of five ministers on account of the
corruption investigations, to see electoral reform through parliament and
then prompt a formal government crisis which would trigger an early poll.
The Amato government could be 'refreshed' after the referendums by a
reshuffle, albeit one short of bringing in other parties to broaden its
support. The present coalition is based on a flimsy 16-seat majority.
Party leaders may also informally reconfirm their support for Mr Amato, who
has regained some stature after stumbling earlier this year after backing an
amnesty for politicians accused of taking bribes on behalf of their parties.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing partners
 -Parliamentary elections must be held every five years. However, in a
country now on its 51st government since the Second World War,
legislatures have seldom lasted their full course. The elections of
April 1992 marked one of the very few occasions that a parliament had
served its full term.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Early elections can be triggered through a formal government 'crisis,'
which occurs when a government no longer commands the support of
parliament. The crisis can lead to the creation of a new government,
without elections, or, failing that, new polls after the president of
the republic (the head of state) dissolves parliament.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -There is no fixed duration for the election campaign.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Given that the electoral system is based on a very pure form of
proportional representation, elections tend to return a large number of
parties to parliament. Sixteen parties are represented in the current
Chamber of Deputies.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -The president nominates a prime minister, who then seeks to put
together a government. Given the consensual nature of Italian politics
and the ubiquity of coalitions, the process of naming a prime minister
and assembling a coalition is usually very lengthy, involving contacts
with different party leaders. A new government has to be approved by
parliament through a vote of confidence.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  .and the models they are looking at
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

A colaition of like-minded parties
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The current cabinet formed after last month's conservative landslide
in National Assembly elections
UDF (centre-right)    16
RPR (Gaullists)       13
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Parliamentary elections must be called every five years. The president
is elected separately every seven years. Early parliamentary elections
can be called by the government itself, triggered by a parliamentary
vote of no confidence, or by the timing of the presidential elections.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -There are two rounds of voting in a parliamentary election. The
official campaign lasts for three weeks before the first vote, during
which time the parties broadcast their political messages. There are
strict controls over political advertising for six months before the
vote, and opinion polls are banned in the campaign's final week.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -In the first round, candidates winning 50 per cent or more of the vote
in their constituencies win outright. All other candidates winning more
than 12.5 per cent go on to the second round a week later. Then, the
candidate winning the most votes is elected.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -The president chooses the prime minister, normally from the party
which has won the most seats, although the constitution does not require
this. The prime minister appoints the cabinet, but the president is
empowered to object to individuals.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Every French government is influenced by its relationship with the
president, whether or not the president's party is represented in the
government. The constitution is vague on the division of power, but
presidents tend to claim authority over foreign affairs and defence
policy.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UK
A single-party administration
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The cabinet formed after the April 1992 general election, except for the
replacement of one minister
CONSERVATIVES       22
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Elections to the House of Commons must be held within five years of a
government's coming to power, but governments can call early elections
and often do. Or they can be forced to the polls by losing a
parlimentary vote of confidence on an important issue, although it is
possible for the Queen (the head of state) to ask someone in parliament
to form a government without an election provided the new administration
can command a parliamentary majority.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -The minimum period between an election being called and polling day is
three weeks, although convention usually dictates a period of about four
weeks.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -There is a single round of voting. The candidate winning the most
votes in a constituency is elected (known as 'the first past the post'
system), even though the candidate may have received considerably less
than 50 per cent of the vote.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -The party winning the most seats in the House of Commons generally
forms the government, with the party's leader as prime minister. The
prime minister chooses the other ministers. Two seats in the cabinet go
to the Leader of the Lords, who is a member of the governing party, and
the Lord Chancellor, who is the chief law officer in the country.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -If the party with the most seats does not command an overall majority,
which rarely happens, it will seek to form a coalition government or
effect an electoral pact with a smaller party or parties to command an
overall majority.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Segni, the quiet Sardinian on a
collision course - The leaders of the Yes and No campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mario Segni, the 'quiet Sardinian' who is the figurehead of the
referendum movement, is an unlikely candidate for the limelight. Though he
is the son of a former president of Italy, early exposure to the world of
politics has done nothing to alter the character of a profoundly shy man. He
is the champion of using referendums to promote political change, but Mr
Segni conforms closely to the popular image of the reticent Sardinian:
saying little, thinking hard, and taking years to get to know properly.
His rise began two years ago, when he organised a referendum on abolishing
the multiple preference ballot system in some elections, which was widely
believed to be subject to abuse. Popular support for the initiative, in
spite of the indifference or hostility of many established politicians,
created a bandwagon effect in which Mr Segni helped to convince Italians
they could change an ossified political system. The referendum movement he
created has attracted reform-minded politicians calling for more honest and
transparent government.
But Mr Segni's belief in the need for radical reform in Italian politics,
and his growing lack of faith in the willingness of the main governing
parties to promote it, has taken him on an accelerating collision course
with much of the political establishment.
Matters reached a head last month when Mr Segni announced he was leaving the
Christian Democrat party, which he has represented as a Sardinia MP for 17
years.
His move reflected frustration with the party's apparent inability to
appreciate the new mood sweeping Italy and get to grips with reform. Having
at first tried to promote change from within Italy's biggest political
grouping, after months of friction with the party nomenklatura, he broke
free.
The move could trigger a deep split in the Catholic vote and further weaken
a party which has traditionally represented a broad spread of views. By
leaving just as investigations into prominent politicians have switched from
allegations of graft and financial irregularities to links with organised
crime, Mr Segni dealt a crushing blow to the image of the Christian
Democrats at a time when they are struggling to show a new, reform-minded
face.
Still only 53, Mr Segni has often been tipped as a man who could lead a new,
cross-party government after the referendums, or, more likely, the elections
that could follow this year. How much support he could gain, given his
ructions with the rump of his party, remains unclear. Though he is widely
seen as one of Italy's men of the future, his immediate prospects are likely
to be coloured by his strained relations with those of the past.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Naples learns to do without 'jobs' -
How Naples shows the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Naples businessman recounts angrily how he was obliged to employ someone
'recommended' by one of the city's political bosses. Getting a call from the
politician after three weeks, he expected to be thanked for taking on a
person he didn't need.
'I told you to give him a job: not make him work]' the politician
complained.
In this endearing metropolis, the most chaotic and crowded in Italy, jobs
and work are not synonymous. The adage goes: 'Jobs you have; work you do.'
Yet the system which has permitted people to have 'jobs' without working is
now under siege in a way unimaginable even a month ago.
All the top Christian Democrat, Socialist and Liberal politicians who have
run the city for the past decade face charges which begin with corruption
and extend to maintaining links with the Camorra, the local Mafia.
The once untouchable big names - Gava, Pomicino, Scotti, de Lorenzo, Di
Donato - have had their reputations destroyed. One of their own political
class, the Christian Democrat deputy, Mr Alfredo Vito, decided to talk; and
explosive evidence came from Mr Pasquale Galasso, a key figure in the
Camorra. As the financial brains behind the L1,500bn (Pounds 630m) empire of
Alfiero Carmine, the most powerful Camorra boss, Mr Galasso knows intimately
how things worked in Naples.
He has talked of vote-buying and of the 'business committee' formed by the
politicians, businessmen and Camorra to carve up the big contracts. The
revelations are breaking a year behind the corruption scandals in the north;
but the pace has snowballed much faster in Naples as people lose their fear
of retribution and confess to magistrates who in turn are dusting off files.
The confessions are laying bare what has long been publicly assumed: the
largest economy in southern Italy has thrived thanks to abusive use of state
funds and official tolerance of organised crime.
An array of criminal activity has been tolerated, ranging from extortion,
gaming, lotteries, recycling stolen goods and drugs to contraband
cigarettes, arms dealing, importing illegal immigrants and an extensive
counterfeit trade. This illicit activity expanded in the 1980s on the back
of a booming drugs trade.
The other economic prop has been the politician's exploitation of
assistenzialismo - the helping hand of the state. A large public sector
pay-roll in Naples combined with a steady stream of financial transfers from
Rome and a big programme of public works have been fertile ground for
patronage.
The Naples municipality has more than 20,000 employees, excess labour has
been stacked into the local health authorities, fictitious jobs found in the
port.
The public works programme has been sustained by inflated and fake
reconstruction contracts after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the 1990
World Cup football preparations or by spinning out projects such as new
hospitals or the metro (after 17 years work only one tranche is complete).
Public-sector spending, coupled with criminal activity in its various forms,
is reckoned to generate two-thirds of the income in the Naples area. But now
the flow of public funds is cut because of budgetary constraints in Rome;
the big contracts have ended and the large industrial groups are shedding
labour at a time when unemployment is touching 25 per cent, among the
highest rates Italy.
The drama of disinvestment is symbolised by the recent plight of SME, the
state-run agribusiness group due to be privatised.
SME occupies the sole fully-used building in an ambitious downtown
commercial property development of a dozen glass skyscrapers. On January 25,
SME's offices were taken over by the workforce in an attempt to block
privatisation or at least prevent this from being an an excuse to move the
headquarters from Naples and reduce jobs.
The main computer was switched off causing delays in privatisation. Even so,
the authorities did not dare to remove the protesters by force.
This week after lengthy secret negotiations between management and
employees, the workers occupying the building agreed to leave in return for
some concessions on employment.
The sense of anger over rising unemployment concerns the authorities.
'Naples is the Italian city most at risk from an explosion of social
protest,' observes a senior policeman.
Indeed, one reason why the illicit economy has been tolerated and justified
is because it has provided a safety valve.
However, most Neapolitans regard the cleansing process as temporary. No new
party like the Lombard League in the north is ready to emerge, either on the
right or left. The Naples council, renewed this month after half the members
were compromised by corruption scandals (the only place for a quorum was in
jail), is based on the same Christian Democrat-Socialist axis. It merely
contains the names of lesser figures who have ridden on the coat-tails of
the former bosses.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Orlando, more respect abroad than at
home - The leaders of the Yes and No campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Leoluca Orlando, the heavily-built ex-mayor of Palermo and founder of La
Rete (The Network), is, like Mr Segni, an unlikely figure on the Italian
political scene. And at first glance he is an unlikely leader of those
arguing against electoral reform. A former prominent Christian Democrat who
split with his party in 1990, he commands a much better press abroad than at
home. A fluent German speaker, educated partly at the University of
Heidelberg, Mr Orlando, 45, is for many foreigners a model for a new breed
of Italian politicians.
His harsh attacks on leading politicians, whom he accuses of corruption and
collusion with organised crime, have won him an audience among those who see
the Mafia around every corner.
The focus of his tirades has been on his former party, notably Mr Giulio
Andreotti, seven times prime minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the previous
leader of the Christian Democrats. This week's allegations of links between
Mr Andreotti and the Mafia have given Mr Orlando's claims added vigour.
A self-confessed rebel since his youth, Mr Orlando, the son of a university
lecturer, has been accused of using the battle against criminal
organisations as a form of self-advancement. With his escort of bodyguards,
frequently-changing programme to foil potential assassins, and an image of
tireless energy, however, he tends to evoke mixed feelings among fellow
Italians.
Mr Orlando has earned the respect of foreigners. But in spite of his image
as a Mafia-fighter, many voters, especially in the north, feel uncomfortable
about his lengthy political career in Sicily, the heartland of the Mafia.
Elected mayor of Palermo in 1985, he scored immense personal successes in a
stream of subsequent polls. At administrative elections in 1990, he gained
over 71,000 preference votes; in regional elections in 1991, he gained more
votes than any other politician in Sicilian history.
For his supporters, Mr Orlando is a tough and courageous leader, not afraid
of speaking out, even at risk to his life. The party he founded, officially
called the Movement for Democracy, started advocating political reform and
clean government well before the revelations of corruption started to shake
Italy's political fabric last year.
But critics portray him as a demagogue. They accuse him of being
self-centred, making controversial statements without facts to back them up,
and secretly hankering for a more presidential type of government in Italy -
perhaps eventually under his leadership.
Suggestions of opportunism are lent weight by Mr Segni's claim that Mr
Orlando originally supported the call for electoral reform, but had second
thoughts. But then, for a small, if growing, party such as La Rete, moving
to any form of voting system which would erode proportional representation
in favour of reinforcing the bigger parties is bound to lead to second
thoughts.

FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: From the banks to drugs, Yes or No
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE electoral reform and party financing are the main issues on which
Italians will vote on Sunday, six other questions require their attention.
Voters will be helped to distinguish between them as each question will be
on a different coloured voting slip. The six 'other' issues in the rainbow
referendum comprise a mixed bag touching on constitutional matters such as
the balance of power between state and regional government and specialised
issues such as reform of the drugs laws.
The balance of power: Three referendums concern curtailing the role of
central government in favour of devolving power to the regions. They involve
abolishing the ministries of agriculture and of tourism and the performing
arts, and removing the Treasury's right to appoint the heads of municipal
and regional savings banks.
In each case, regional interests claim the tasks can be performed better if
responsibility is handed down from Rome. Regional and local authorities
already have some role regarding tourism and the performing arts. However,
the most important decisions have to be taken in the capital.
Reducing the role of the central government is also the aim of the vote on
bank chairmanships. Foreign bankers find it hard to believe that Italy's
Treasury minister has to choose the chairmen of the country's savings banks.
The shift would mark a step towards de-politicising the highly political
savings bank system, say the referendum's supporters.
Similar arguments surround the vote on abolishing the Farm Ministry.
However, here the case against centralisation is harder to sustain in view
of the integration of European farming in the Common Agricultural Policy and
the need for co-ordinated national positions in Brussels. This explains the
strong opposition by some parties to the initiatives to abolish both
ministries.
By contrast, the fourth referendum on the abolition of the Ministry of State
Shareholdings has been made largely redundant following the decision by the
Amato government to merge the portfolio with that of the industry minister.
The Ministry of State Shareholdings was traditionally a source of power for
the governing parties. However, with privatisation a central part of the
Amato government's policy, its function has been eroded. Environment and
drugs. The two other referendums are a mixed bag. The one seeking to strip
local health authorities of responsibility for environmental controls is
something of an attempt to transfer power back to the state from local
level. The powers would probably end up with the Environment Ministry.
Instances of local health authorities being unable to discharge
environmental responsibilities abound. In the marble quarries of Carrara in
Tuscany, union representatives complain that the local health authority does
not police quarrying or pollution controls.
Lastly, Italians must vote on abolishing a law which makes the possession of
drugs a criminal offence. The motive is not to create a junkie free-for-all
but to reinstate an earlier law, now in abeyance, which tried to distinguish
between drug possession for personal use, which was not a crime, from
holding larger quantities of narcotics, presumably for sale.

FT  16 APR 93 / EC calls for full telecoms competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should open all international and domestic telephone
calls to full competition by 1998, according to one of the two EC
commissioners responsible for telecommunications liberalisation.
In a speech to post and telecoms representatives in Brussels yesterday, Mr
Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said he favoured the
controversial combination of a set target and short timetable for full
telecoms liberalisation.
He ruled out an 'immediate big bang' to open up the telecoms market, but he
said a longer transition period - for example, up to the end of this century
 -'would restrict the development of the single market without
justification', and impede technical advances.
Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, are
expected to submit formal proposals to their Commission colleagues within
the next two weeks in the hope that EC telecoms ministers will be able to
discuss the Commission plans at their meeting on May 10.
If approved, the plans will trigger a long and possibly acrimonious debate
between member states, some of which are fiercely protective of their
national telephone monopolies. France, Belgium and Germany, for example,
think it will be difficult to achieve full liberalisation within five years,
while Britain and Denmark have already made moves to open their markets to
competition.
Mr Van Miert tried to soothe potential opposition yesterday by making clear
that liberalisation had to be accompanied by important safeguards to
preserve benefits for all users. 'What I am aiming for is not a change from
the current highly regulated monopolies based on member states to an
unbridled free-for-all,' he explained.
But he ruled out an intermediate stage during which only telephone calls
between EC member states would be opened to competition. Mr Van Miert said
that most telecoms operators and regulators consulted by the Commission over
the last six months had opposed the suggestion, which was originally
favoured by Brussels.
Liberalisation would give all potential operators, including those from
outside the EC, access to European telephone networks. But Mr Van Miert
hinted in his speech that the Commission should press for equal access to
third-country markets in return.
According to Mr Van Miert, the Community should first reinforce existing EC
measures which open up specialised telecoms services representing 20 per
cent of the market, before preparing full liberalisation of the remaining 80
per cent.

FT  16 APR 93 / UK currency plan likely to be vetoed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS by Britain to increase support for weak currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism seem likely to be vetoed by other countries in a
move which could add a further barrier to the UK's eventual re-entry into
the system.
The suggestion was made during discussions by the European Community's
committee of central bank governors. The group is meeting early next week in
Basle, Switzerland, to finalise a report on possible ERM reforms.
Under the UK's proposal, weak currencies in the system could be helped by
joint efforts by several ERM countries, rather than the single country with
the strongest currency.
These technical moves would be a mixture of both interventions on currency
markets and changes in interest rates. Profits and losses on purchases of
weak currencies to increase their value would be shared by all the nations
in the system.
The UK suggestion, which comes close to following a policy idea from the
opposition Labour party, has received only limited support from the other 11
nations represented on the governors' committee.
One objection, voiced in particular by the German Bundesbank, is that the
proposal might reduce the pressures on countries with weak currencies to
devalue in order to remove currency strains.
However, some support for the concept of sharing out the burden of
supporting weak currencies is believed to have come from nations such as
Spain, Portugal and Ireland.

FT  16 APR 93 / EBRD chairman to question Attali on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who is chairman of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, will question Mr Jacques Attali, the
bank's president, within the next few days over allegations of excessive
spending at the bank.
Mr Waigel will raise the concerns over the bank's expenditure during a
meeting with Mr Attali in Bonn before next week's annual meeting of the
bank's governors.
The controversy over the bank follows the disclosure that it has spent more
than Pounds 200m in the past two years on fitting out its London offices,
travel for executives, entertainment, and other running costs. During that
period the bank has disbursed loans worth about Pounds 125m.
Mr Waigel, in Tokyo for the emergency meeting of the Group of Seven foreign
and finance ministers, referring to questions about the bank's spending,
said: 'These may be points we will discuss at next week's meeting. I will do
my duty as chairman of the bank to test the validity of these allegations.'
Mr Waigel said he had already asked the bank for a report on allegations of
excessive spending on private jets to take Mr Attali around Europe, the
fitting out of the bank's London headquarters and its Christmas party in the
ballroom of a London hotel.
Mr Waigel said: 'If we find any unjustified expenditures we will draw the
appropriate consequences.'
The EBRD last night gave a breakdown of the money it spent on its previous
headquarters in Leadenhall Street, London, which it occupied for 20 months
until last December. Of Pounds 18m, Pounds 11.4m was paid in rent and Pounds
6.6m on fitting out the offices. It said half the Pounds 6.6m was spent on
furniture and equipment, which it is now using at its new headquarters in
Broadgate in the City of London. It added that 1,200 people attended its
Christmas party, which cost Pounds 52,000, so the cost per head was Pounds
40.
It is understood that Britain, the US and Canada have led criticism of Mr
Attali's management of the bank.
The US has been particularly critical of the slow rate at which the bank has
extended loans.
The US was at the centre of recent changes in the bank's management designed
to speed up disbursement of loans, according to senior European officials.

FT  16 APR 93 / Major and Owen reject Bosnia arms call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen, one of the
international mediators for a peace agreement in Bosnia, yesterday rejected
suggestions that supplying arms to the Moslems would help resolve the
year-old conflict there.
Mr Major, answering a parliamentary question, said the weapons flow to all
sides should be cut off rather than increased. The US has said that a
partial lifting of the United Nations arms ban to help the Moslems defend
themselves against Serb attacks was under consideration to put pressure on
the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen.
The public endorsement of such a step earlier this week by the former
British prime minister, Lady Thatcher, has provoked a political debate in
Britain about the need for the international community to take more decisive
action to stop Serb aggression.
Escalation of the debate came as Serbs last night launched a heavy assault
on the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in east Bosnia, according to
Bosnian radio. The defenders were said to have been pushed to within 2km of
the town.
Lord Owen said in a BBC radio interview: 'The whole European Community takes
the view that lifting the arms embargo is not the right priority at this
stage and that the fundamental thing is tightening sanctions' against the
rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro,
Speaking after talks in London with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special
envoy to the peace talks, Lord Owen said the danger of arming the Moslems
was that it would unleash an armaments race.
At a meeting later yesterday with Mr Douglas Hogg, a British Foreign Office
Minister, Mr Bartholomew was understood to have accepted that a decision to
lift sanctions would inevitably increase the fighting.
Mr Bartholomew, who later had talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence
Secretary, and Mr Hogg agreed that everything possible should be done to
ensure that a resolution to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia should
be pushed through the Security Council later this month, if the Bosnian
Serbs had still not signed the Vance-Owen plan.

FT  16 APR 93 / Party may fire heads of Spanish companies
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S conservative opposition party, the Partido Popular, which is
believed to be slightly ahead of the ruling Socialist party in opinion
polls, is raising doubts about whether the chairmen of some of Spain's
largest companies would keep their jobs if the PP won the general election
on June 6.
The party has said it would leave until after the election any decision on
the future shape of the boards of public and semi-public companies. The
uncertainty could upset a partial privatisation programme of public
companies drawn up by the Socialist government.
It includes flotations of shares in Repsol, oil and energy group, sale of up
to 24.9 per cent of Argentaria, the state-owned banking group, and,
possibly, a further reduction of the stake in the tobacco monopoly
Tabacalera and Endesa, the electricity utility.
In the case of Repsol and Argentaria, institutions leading the flotations
have relied heavily on the experience and capabilities of their respective
chairmen - Mr Oscar Fanjul and Mr Francisco Luzon, founding chiefs of the
companies - to generate interest among foreign investors.
Both men are closely identified with the Socialist government, particularly
the finance ministry. Repsol has just rushed through a flotation of 13 per
cent of its stock.

FT  16 APR 93 / No early end to bloodshed: Proposals for outside military
intervention all have their risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE military intervention to stop the bombardment of civilians in Bosnia
is a daunting prospect for a number of reasons, but the sophistication of
Bosnian Serb forces is certainly not among them.
Strong on heavy weapons but low on manpower, they have lacked the infantry
strength for decisive territorial advances. Their numbers, reckoned to have
shrunk in the past year, are put at 40,000-60,000, against about 40,000
Moslem and 45,000 Croat forces. Serb positions are stretched over a long
front, with long lines of communications. The morale of the average soldier
is questionable.
Western military experts see the evidence of high-quality officer training
dwindling below senior levels. Local commanders are loosely controlled.
With crude siege tactics focusing on civilian targets, Serb units have
generally had to do little but protect their gun positions. Their M84 tanks,
versions of Russian T-72s, are employed less in their intended role than as
artillery pieces. Using high positions, Serb gunners can maintain terror
even with a low rate of fire.
This dismal picture fuels the widespread frustration felt by UN troops now
involved in relief efforts. But none of the proposals for more forceful
military engagement under UN authority promises an early end to the
bloodshed.
The main proposals are:
Tighter enforcement of sanctions. This is feasible but would not directly
affect Serb forces' firepower. They have no shortage of weapons or
munitions, even though parts of the former Yugoslav arms industry are in
Moslem or Croat-areas of Bosnia. Current stockpiles could sustain the war at
least through this year and some experts say up to six years.
Air strikes. Among others, Lord Owen, the EC mediator, has said air power
should be considered as a means of pressure on the Serbs. However, the
demonstration of western technology in 1991 Gulf war has led to exaggerated
expectations. Conditions there were ideal: open country, good visibility,
large targets, wide international backing. Bosnia presents a very different
picture.
Strikes on artillery positions would destroy some weapons and force the
Serbs to move others. But the wooded mountain terrain would make identifying
targets difficult. Munitions are not kept in huge dumps like Iraq's.
The risks are that air strikes would force the UN to call off the
humanitarian supply effort - which has arguably saved more lives than have
been lost in the fighting - and would stiffen Serb determination.
To meet Russian objections, the recently-launched Operation Deny Flight,
enforcing the no-fly zone, precludes attacks on ground targets, except in
self-defence. The flight ban is generally seen as more political than
military inpurpose.
If it succeeds in stopping the use of Mi-8 Hip and Gazelle helicopters to
support forward Serb positions it will hamper current Serb tactics. Nato
aircraft could also be given authority to attack anti-aircraft facilities.
Safe havens. Broadly modelled on the successful initiative in northern Iraq,
this would again be more complex in the Bosnian context, and would require
substantial forces. The risk is creating Moslem ghettoes and abetting Serb
war aims.
A full-scale peacekeeping force. Nato has provisional plans for putting
together a force of perhaps 65,000-75,000, with air support, which could be
sent once a genuine ceasefire was established. Going beyond traditional
lightly-armed UN peacekeeping, it would be prepared to tackle flare-ups, but
not a total ceasefire breakdown.
Nato commanders believe Russian participation alongside the main US, French
and British contingents could be crucial to the success of such an
operation, both for even-handedness and as means of exercising a moderating
influence on Serbs.
Tasks would include ensuring the withdrawal, demilitarisation and disarming
of warring militias and the establishment of an effective police. But the
record of UN forces trying to do just this in Serb-controlled parts of
Croatia does not augur well. It is also a role in which the US, which would
be relied on to provide up to 25,000 of the troops, has relatively little
experience.

FT  16 APR 93 / East Europe looks askance at bank: But the Attali row is not
top of the region's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<TEXT>
THE amount of money disbursed by the EBRD compared with amounts it has spent
on its staff and officials is just one of many financial issues preoccupying
east European officials. But it is hardly top of their agenda.
'We are in the middle of debating the budget,' one Bulgarian official said.
'We are in the middle of what could be described as a kind of trade war,'
said a Hungarian official. He was referring to a one-month ban imposed by
the European Community on some meat imports, provoking retaliatory action
from east European countries. A Czech official said: 'We are trying to get
much closer to the Community. The EBRD is not what you call top of our
agenda.'
Despite these other concerns, several east European officials have
reservations and anecdotes about the organisation of the EBRD.
'I'm not that surprised to read about the way the bank spends its money,'
one Bulgarian official said. 'Look, I was told that when the bank set up its
office in Sofia, it bought everything from abroad. It didn't even buy the
nails from Bulgaria. If the bank wants to do business with us, why not at
least make some sort of gesture?'
Another Bulgarian official remarked: 'The nails came from Britain.' He went
on: 'The other complaint we have about the bank is that it is too slow in
investing in the private sector. The bank, until recently, has supported big
projects. But we are not looking for big loans. We want to build up
small-scale industry. When we told the bank this, it said the people to
implement these projects did not exist in Bulgaria. That's bull-shit.'
But he and other east European officials believe the bank has enough vision
under Mr Jacques Attali to push through a plan drawn up by Mr Ronald
Freeman, head of the bank's merchant banking division. 'Mr Freeman's
argument is that if the west is going to provide aid to Russia, why doesn't
the west pay the countries of eastern Europe to supply the food, commodities
and machinery,' said an east European diplomat.
A senior Hungarian official said the bank had 'done some good deals here.
Not all are first class, but we are quite satified.' Yet the official, in
common with other officials from central Europe, admitted the bank was slow
in disbursing money. 'Since April 1991 until the end of last year, the bank
has committed Ecu250m (Pounds 198m) for investment in 11 Hungarian
enterprises. But only Ecu20m has been disbursed. The bank could be a lot
faster. But we appreciate its efforts,' another Hungarian official added.
'I suppose if you are going to criticise the bank, you should not raise the
question of its survival. Instead, the issue of accountability should be
raised - you know, making it more open. Looking at how decisions are made.
That sort of thing,' she added. Similar views about slow disbursement and
decisions were echoed by Czech and Polish officials. A Czech official wanted
the bank to take more risks, despite the limitations of its mandate. A
Polish official said: 'Maybe the bank could be a bit more open.'
But Mr Attali is open when it comes to getting invitations, says a diplomat.
'Whenever there is a state visit or a prominent official coming to London,
Mr Attali insists on getting invited to dinner or receptions. . . He is very
pushy and often very condescending to the east Europeans. But he has put
eastern Europe high on the agenda.'

FT  16 APR 93 / Mladic scorns western threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Ratko Mladic, the commander of Bosnian Serb forces, is unfazed by
threats from the international community to punish Serbs for the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Instead, he simply insists Serbs will never cave in to western demands.
'They can negotiate everything with us but will never achieve anything
through pressure,' he said last week.
The stocky 51-year-old is a mass of contradictions. He had a reputation for
brutality even before the war erupted in former Yugoslavia and the US last
year named him as a potential war criminal. But he has been described by
some UN officials as a 'soldier's soldier', while others view him as an
intelligent officer and a skilled strategist.
Gen Mladic was born in Kalinovik, southern Bosnia, in the second world war.
The death of his father, fighting with Tito's communist partisans, appears
to have instilled in his son a hatred for Germany.
When the war in Croatia erupted in 1991, Gen Mladic was transferred to Knin,
the mountain stronghold of Croatia's rebel Serbs, where he was adored by his
soldiers and the local population. A career officer in the Yugoslav People's
Army, he was picked by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over the
objections of senior officers. 'He was intentionally installed by Milosevic
to supervise the war in Bosnia,' one diplomat says.
Last week's attack on Srebrenica, the eastern enclave, was described by the
UN commander as an 'atrocity'. The attack came in spite of a promise by Gen
Mladic that Serb forces around Srebrenica would not respond to 'Moslem
provocations'.
He has called the onslaught 'protection of Serbian villages under attack by
Moslem soldiers'. He has denied that Moslem villagers are starving. 'They
have plenty of food and what they lacked was delivered by the US air drops,'
he said. But last month he gave the go-ahead to evacuate women and children
from Srebrenica.
Local Moslem authorities initially tried to stop the evacuation on the
grounds it was helping Serbs in their drive to expel all Moslems from
eastern Bosnia. But Gen Mladic told Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior official of
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: 'You should have come with 300
trucks, I am happy if they can all get out.'
He allowed a single Moslem man pleading, 'Sir, sir' to pass with the convoy
of women and children. He said: 'I am not sir, I am General Mladic.' He
turned to Mr Jolles and said. 'You see I've given this man back his life.'
'He is constantly contradicting himself. He can be extremely charming and
extremely brutal,' says a senior UN official.
When Gen Mladic is in an area, convoys pass through check points without a
hitch. UN officials and diplomats believe he is in control in spite of
speculation to the contrary.

FT  16 APR 93 / Heads may roll in Spanish companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S conservative opposition party, the Partido Popular, which is
believed to be slightly ahead of the ruling Socialist party in opinion
polls, is raising doubts about whether the chairmen of some of Spain's
largest companies would keep their jobs if the PP won the general election
on June 6.
The party has said it would leave until after the election any decision on
the future shape of the boards of public and semi-public companies. The
uncertainty could upset a partial privatisation programme of public
companies drawn up by the socialist government.
It includes flotations of shares in the Repsol oil and energy group, the
sale of up to 24.9 per cent of Argentaria, the state-owned banking group
and, possibly, a further reduction of the state's stake in the tobacco
monopoly, Tabacalera and Endesa, the electricity utility.
In the case of Repsol and Argentaria, institutions leading the flotations
have relied heavily on the experience and capabilities of their respective
chairmen - Mr Oscar Fanjul and Mr Francisco Luzon, founding chiefs of the
companies - to generate interest among foreign investors.
Both men are closely identified with the socialist government, particularly
the finance ministry. Repsol has just rushed through a flotation of 13 per
cent of its stock.
The state now owns 41 per cent of Repsol, and all of Argentaria.
Argentaria, which has just announced a pricing range for its flotation,
could be particularly exposed by the timing of the election.
Asked how the boards of public and semi-public companies would be affected
by a PP victory in June, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader said earlier this
week that 'it is something I will decide after the election'.
It is widely expected in Madrid that the PP would place people of its own
choosing at the heads of companies that fall under government control. The
socialists did exactly that when they came to power in 1982 under Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
Controlling these companies - especially those, such as Telefonica, Repsol
and Endesa, whose stock trades in markets outside Spain - are regarded as
part of the prize of winning an election.
Officials at groups such as Repsol and Argentaria, say the loss of their
chairmen would not necessarily affect the businesses, since both companies
have in place strong management structures that would function whoever was
in charge.
One leading broker in Madrid said yesterday: 'Luzon is central to Argentaria
but the strategy has been laid down and a good replacement would surely
continue with the group's growth.'

FT  16 APR 93 / AT&amp;T intends to compete with BT and Mercury in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE BY America's largest telephone operator to challenge BT and Mercury
on their home ground by offering international businesses their own private
networks was yesterday welcomed by the British government.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which favours opening up the UK's
Pounds 15bn telephone market to foreign competition, said the application by
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph would be considered on its merits.
Moves to liberalise the European Community telephone service by 1998 were
backed by Mr Karel Van Miert, EC Commissioner, in Brussels yesterday.
Mr Van Miert's comments were the first clear indication that the Commission,
the EC's executive body, is likely to endorse a policy paper calling for
full deregulation of national telephone monopolies by 1998.
The AT&amp;T application is direct retaliation for BT's application to the US
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a licence enabling it to sell
international customers a broad range of voice, data and video services.
The UK company said it welcomed AT&amp;T's application and the prospect of
competition, but argued that its success should be dependent on the success
of its own application to the FCC.
Mercury Communications' response, however, reflected its difficulties in
negotiating access to BT's UK network. The UK's other licensed carrier said
it welcomed AT&amp;T's recognition that BT's dominance of the local distribution
of telephone calls was the main bottleneck to the growth of effective
competition in the UK.
AT&amp;T's initial intention is to offer international business customers a
range of services based on the resale of telephone lines purchased from BT
or Mercury.
It made clear, however, that the aim was eventually to compete
comprehensively in the UK, selling services to both business and domestic
customers and creating its own network.
AT&amp;T said it was aware its plans needed the approval of both the UK and US
governments. The DTI said yesterday that it welcomed the application as
evidence that AT&amp;T believed there were equivalent opportunities for US
companies in the UK as for UK telecommunications operators in the US.
AT&amp;T said yesterday that it had been urging the FCC and the Clinton
administration to withhold approval of BT's application until US carriers
had comparable access to the British market.
It said once equivalent access had been achieved, it would support BT's
request.

FT  16 APR 93 / G7 backs Yeltsin with Pounds 28bn: Package tied to continued
economic and political reforms in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven leading industrialised nations yesterday threw their
weight behind President Boris Yeltsin and his economic reforms ahead of the
Russian referendum with a financial package worth Dollars 43bn (Pounds
28bn).
Although the bigger-than-expected package includes some existing
commitments, it is explicitly tied to continued economic and political
reform in Russia, strengthening Mr Yeltsin's hand against his opponents.
The G7 package is also tacitly linked to continued Russian co-operation on
foreign policy issues.
It seeks particularly to ensure that Moscow does not stand in the way of
western plans to implement tougher sanctions against Serbia in the attempt
to resolve the deepening crisis in former Yugoslavia.
'Russian reform and progress towards democratisation are essential to world
peace,' the G7 said. 'We assure the Russian people of our support in coping
with the inevitable hardships of the transition period.'
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, warned that the 'world
will be a considerably more dangerous place' if Mr Yeltsin and his reforms
did not prevail. The package was 'in no way a programme of charity', he
said.
The latest effort by the G7 to prop up Mr Yeltsin came as the Russian leader
went on the offensive in Moscow in his efforts to win popular support for
his presidency in a referendum on April 25.
He told supporters he would not obey the strict rules for the referendum set
by his rivals in the Russian parliament and ordered a drastic cut in the
privileges and duties of his rebellious vice president, General Alexander
Rutskoi.
The bulk of the multilateral aid package comprises existing commitments of
assistance from international financial institutions such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund which have been brought together for the
first time.
The main new ingredients are confirmation of an innovative Dollars 3bn IMF
loan facility which will be available in two tranches as Russia adopts
policies designed to curb inflation and its budget deficit.
In addition there will be a Dollars 300m small business development fund
mainly financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The
EBRD will also prepare plans for a Russian bank for small business
development.
The other main ingredients of the package are:
A Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling deal agreed by Russia's 19 creditor
countries in Paris on April 2.
About Dollars 10bn in longer term loans from the IMF which were originally
offered last year but not taken up by the Russians.
The US, Japan and the UK between them made new bilateral pledges of aid
worth more than Dollars 4bn. Much of this is expected to form part of a
commitment from G7 countries to provide export credits totalling about
Dollars 10bn.
Loans from the World Bank to restructure Russian industry worth about
Dollars 5bn, most of which will be made available over the next 15 months.
The ministers also agreed to study a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn fund to
promote the privatisation of large state run enterprises.
US officials said they were not disappointed that the fund had not been
agreed but they made it clear the US expects such a fund to be approved at
the G7 heads of state summit due to be held in Tokyo in July.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian deputy prime minister who attended the two
days of talks with G7 foreign and finance ministers, said Russia was
satisfied with the outcome.

FT  16 APR 93 / Major squares up to social chapter challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT embarked on a high-risk strategy to outflank Tory opponents
of the Maastricht treaty last night by meeting head on a Labour challenge
for an explicit vote by MPs on Britain's exclusion of the social chapter.
Mr John Major signalled a new effort to speed up the pace of the legislation
when he agreed to a Labour demand to make final ratification contingent on a
separate debate on the opt-out from its social provisions.
Amid chaotic scenes in the House of Commons, the decision was immediately
followed by an embarrassing, if temporary, retreat by the government on the
bill's timetable.
The opposition failed to reverse a decision by Mr Michael Morris, the deputy
speaker, to block a vote on an earlier amendment covering the social
chapter.
Under the Byzantine procedures of Westminster, the second proposed change to
the bill - known as amendment 27 - is seen by Labour and by Tory
Euro-sceptics as their strongest hope of derailing the ratification process.
Labour responded to Mr Morris's ruling with a tactical device that forced
the government to curtail debate on the legislation until next week. It said
the government's failure to muster enough votes against the move
demonstrated that it was no longer in control of the Commons.
Mr Major's decision not to contest the first Labour amendment - known as new
clause 75 - means MPs will have the opportunity to vote later in the summer
on whether they want to preserve the social-chapter opt-out. That vote,
though, will come only after the Maastricht bill has passed all its
parliamentary hurdles and received royal assent.
The timing left ministers free to float the possibility - fiercely rejected
by the opposition parties - that at this late stage in the ratification
process the government might simply ignore a defeat and press on regardless.
Senior ministers said their aim in accepting the new clause 75 was to
'disentangle' the social chapter from the wider issue of whether Britain
should ratify Maastricht. They admitted the underlying strategy was to
detach the Tory Euro-sceptics from their alliance with the opposition
parties.
The judgment in Downing Street is that even the strongest opponents of the
treaty on the Tory back benches will not be able to back inclusion of the
social chapter once the rest of the treaty has been enacted into law.
Mr Major's aides refused to speculate on what course the government would
take if the Conservative Euro-sceptics did combine with the opposition to
include the social chapter.
Senior ministers voiced confidence that the present committee stage of
legislation would now be completed within weeks - possibly as early as next
week, when MPs will debate it on three days. The government would then be
free to start its shorter final stage in the Commons immediately after the
Danish referendum next month. Royal assent would follow before the summer
recess at the end of July.
Optimism in Downing Street that the prime minister is now poised for a
breakthrough in his 18-month battle to secure ratification was dismissed by
Labour.
Mr George Robertson, the opposition spokesman on Europe, said Labour was
determined to press its case for a vote on amendment 27 when the legislation
reached its report stage. He insisted that the case for such a vote was
'unanswerable'.
