FT  16 APR 93 / Post Office sell-off postponed until 1994 at earliest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET MINISTERS have agreed to delay privatising the Post Office because
of pressure on the government's legislative programme and a dispute over the
best form for the sell-off.
The cabinet is expected to agree next Thursday on an outline programme for
legislation in the parliamentary session starting in the autumn that
includes the privatisation of British Coal but not the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has still to decide
whether to sell the Post Office as one unit or break it into three - the
Royal Mail, Post Office Counters and Parcelforce.
The sale is sensitive among Conservative MPs because of worries about the
impact on the postal service in Tory-held rural constituencies.
No clear option has emerged that will break the Royal Mail's monopoly,
increase competition and keep the government's commitment to a nationwide
delivery service with uniform prices. The Treasury also wants to ensure
maximum revenue from the sale, which could still take place before the next
general election.
Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and industry minister with direct responsibility
for the Post Office, is a strong supporter of privatisation. But he is
understood to agree with the FLG (future legislation) cabinet committee,
chaired by Mr Tony Newton, leader of the house, that the measure should be
delayed until at least next year.
Within Whitehall, there is no expectation that the full cabinet will
overturn that decision.
The sale of Parcelforce could still proceed without legislation. Under the
British Telecommunications Act 1981, Mr Heseltine has the power to sell Post
Office subsidiaries. But he is unlikely to take a decision on this part of
the privatisation until he has decided on the overall form of the sale.
Mr John Major, prime minister, wants to draw up a distinctive legislative
programme that will rally the Conservative party after a bruising
parliamentary year dominated by the Maastricht bill. The next session is
expected to include a substantial criminal justice bill and the
restructuring of the police force.
The Department of Education wants to end the obligation of students to join
the National Union of Students and reform the training of teachers. The
Department of Trade and Industry plans a deregulation bill and the
environment department a 'green' bill, setting up an environmental
protection agency. Legislation is also expected from the social security
department on reforming - and cutting the cost of - invalidity benefit.
However, it remains unclear whether two politically sensitive bills will be
included: on equalising the male and female state retirement ages and on
Sunday trading. The cabinet may not make a final decision of these for some
time.
The Home Office hopes to publish a draft bill on Sunday trading before MPs
begin their summer recess, probably in late July. That will set out three
options for MPs and ministers hope the bill will proceed in the next
session.
Pensions equalisation is a weaker contender because Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, has still to decide formally on whether to raise the
retirement age for women from 60 to 65 - the same as men.
With the decision to make women work longer likely to be politically
unpopular, some ministers see a strong argument for waiting another year.

<TEXT>
Anglo-Eastern Plantations continued to progress through the second half and
for the full 1992 year achieved a rise in profits from Pounds 471,000 to
Pounds 1.32m pre-tax.
Having returned to the dividend list at the midway stage the rubber, cocoa
and palm oil estates company is now recommending a 1p final for a 1.375p
total.
Turnover totalled Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 3.73m). Earnings per share rose to
3.4p (1.1p).
The directors said the improved results reflected the first full year of
operation of the palm oil mill and a strong palm oil price throughout 1992.
Anglo-Eastern is owned 49.2 per cent by Chillington.

MR Klaus Piltz, chairman of Veba, Germany's fourth-largest industrial group,
was killed in an avalanche on Easter Monday, the company said yesterday. Two
of his three children, Uta and Klaus, and a family friend also died in the
accident in Oetztal, Austria, Christopher Parkes reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Piltz, 57, took control of the energy-to-retailing conglomerate less than
four years ago after the death of Mr Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder.
His main contribution to the Dusseldorf-based company was to restructure his
predecessor's acquisitions, rather than sell them off as expected. He
moulded a group with distinct but interlocking interests in energy,
chemicals, petrol stations, retailing, transport and distribution.

<TEXT>
SEGA, the Japanese video games and entertainment company, is linking with
Time Warner and Tele-Communications (TCI), two of the largest US cable
television companies, to deliver video games software directly to US homes.
The three companies are setting up a joint venture company in the US that
will use satellite broadcasting to send Sega video games software to
subscribers of Time Warner and TCI's cable television.
They will take equal shares in the new company, which is due to be
established in the US this summer.
Details of the video games service have not yet been finalised, but the
subscription fee is expected to be between Dollars 15 and Dollars 20.
Subscribers will need a Sega Genesis video games machine, selling for about
Dollars 100 in the US, and an adaptor, unless they own one of the 7.5m
Genesis machines sold in the US.
Sega said the large base of Genesis users was expected to provide the first
subscribers. It believes the service could attract most of the 20m
subscribers to Time Warner and TCI's cable television service.
The deal places Sega a step ahead of Nintendo, the largest video games
manufacturer and Sega's arch-rival, which has been planning to launch a
similar service.

FT  15 APR 93 / Britain in approach to India on environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government has asked India to form an environmental alliance to help
unblock international 'green' negotiations in the follow-up to the Rio Earth
Summit.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, who proposed the initiative in a
letter on April 6 to Mr Kamal Nath, the Indian Environment and Forestries
minister, said yesterday: 'We both have a good deal of influence at our
disposal, the UK as part of the developed nations group and India as part of
the developing nations.'
He added that 'without some political will behind it' there was 'a great
danger' that the Commission for Sustainable Development, the body that will
follow up Rio's ambitious agenda set in Rio last June, would become 'just
another bureaucratic arm of the United Nations.'
A pact could have con-siderable impact on discussions on how to put last
June's Rio agreements into practice, which have been handicapped by
north-south divisions, in particular over financing.
However, an alliance would have to bridge the wide differences between the
UK and India on many 'green' issues.
Their past disagreements include the future of forests and the role for the
global environment facility, the fund administered by the World Bank and the
United Nations to help the Third World to finance projects which help the
global environment.
Mr Howard said 'we have not established a total identity of view but we have
established a common approach.'

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Banco Central Hispano nears
marketing accord with SocGen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Central Hispano, one of Spain's leading banks, is close to reaching an
agreement with France's Societe Generale which will allow the two banks to
pool their marketing resources outside their domestic bases. The agreement
will also enable the banks to use each other's branch networks.
The pact, which is likely to be signed next week, is seen by the Spanish
bank as an important part of an attempt to restart Europartners, a
consortium that pooled BCH with Credit Lyonnais of France, Banco di Roma of
Italy and Commerzbank of Germany.
The German bank maintains its links with BCH through a 4.7 per cent stake
that it owns in the Spanish bank's equity, but the Europartners initiative
was abandoned after Credit Lyonnais started building up its own branch
network in Spain at the beginning of the 1990s.
Societe Generale, which is poised to replace Credit Lyonnais as BCH's
partner in France, is in the meantime exploring possible joint initiatives
with Commerzbank and with National Westminster of the UK.
A spokeswoman for BCH said that Societe Generale's potential links in the UK
and in Germany were separate from the French bank's forthcoming agreement in
Spain. BCH is seeking a UK partner with which to forge a similar commercial
pact, but this is unlikely to be National Westminster, Barclays or Lloyds,
all of which already have branch networks in Spain.
Last month, BCH exchanged 2 per cent of its equity for a 10 per cent stake
in Banco Commercial Portugues, BCP, in the biggest share-swap agreement to
date between Spanish and Portuguese banking institutions.

FT  15 APR 93 / Interagra applies to court for bankruptcy protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERAGRA, the French farming products business which was one of the most
prominent western suppliers of grain and food to eastern Europe during the
cold war, yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection.
The company, founded in 1955 by the late Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, known as le
milliardaire rouge, the red billionaire, has applied to the Paris commercial
court for protection. The court will announce its judgment on Tuesday.
In its heyday Interagra made annual sales of up to FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn)
by selling the European Community's 'food mountain' - surplus supplies of
subsidised grain, meat, dairy products and powdered milk - to communist
countries.
Mr Doumeng built up the business by exploiting his personal connections with
eastern bloc leaders. He was one of the handful of western businessmen,
alongside Mr Armand Hammer, the US-based oil trader, and Mr Robert Maxwell,
the disgraced British media tycoon, to operate successfully in the old
communist bloc.
But Interagra has floundered since Mr Doumeng's death in 1987. His sons,
Michel and Jean-Baptiste, who took over the business, did not have the
advantage of their father's contacts. The final blows were the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the UN embargo on trading with Iraq during the Gulf
war, which sealed off one of its main markets for wheat and meat.
Interagra's annual sales have fallen to just FFr5bn a year and its debts
have risen rapidly to the present level of FFr500m.
The management has for some months been in discussion with its banks, which
include the Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the French
state-controlled banks, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure new finance.
Four of the old Doumeng businesses, including the Seav Interagra tractor
company and Silos du Sud-Oest farm machinery maker, are already under court
administration. Sepromec, the Interagra parent company, and SCIII, one of
its trading subsidiaries, have also applied for bankruptcy protection.

FT  15 APR 93 / Party puts policies before perks: Emiko Terazono on the
group trying to clean up Japanese politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE MAIN street of Nagata-cho, Japan's political centre, a group of
middle-aged women climb into a tour bus to complete a day of politics and
sightseeing with a boat ride around the Tokyo Bay and an evening variety
show with the compliments of their local MP.
Mr Yoshio Terasawa, a member of the Japan New Party, is still shocked at
such sights. 'These practices have to go,' he says. As revelations of
political corruption have heightened discontent towards the ruling Liberal
Democratic party and existing opposition parties, the JNP has presented
itself as the party which can clean up politics.
He also points a finger at Japanese voters. 'Japanese politics has
deteriorated because people choose politicians who give out the best perks,'
says Mr Terasawa, ex-vice president of Nomura Securities and former
executive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
The party is quickly winning support. According to a poll by the Nikkei
Shimbun 6.7 per cent of 10,000 registered voters supported the JNP, up from
0.7 per cent last June, and 2.8 per cent in December, pushing it to the
third most popular party. The tax evasion scandal involving Mr Shin
Kanemaru, the former kingmaker of the LDP, has given impetus to public
support for the party, which calls for a more transparent political system.
It also calls for free trade, including the opening up of rice markets, and
advocates curbing powers of the bureacracy. However, in spite of its
different outlook on politics, the JNP faces the same problems as other
parties - lack of funds. The JNP is at a disadvantage since it lacks of
connections with corporations and labour unions which exisisting parties
have.
Donations from companies and individuals, which constitute over 50 per cent
of revenues for the LDP, are also sparse for the newest opposition party.
Companies are reluctant to provide funds due to falling profits.
The JNP has raised Y300m by selling party hankies and T-shirts, but will
have to market a lot more if it is going to support at least 60 candidates
in the next general election slated for the second half of the year. Mr
Terasawa is now trying to woo wealthy individuals and owners of small
companies for donations.
A single LDP candidate would need about Y300m, paying for flashy campaign
cars, posters and payouts. 'It's shocking but it happens,' says Mr Terasawa,
describing a case where Y10,000 notes, were distributed hidden in onigiri -
Japanese rice ball snacks.
But Japanese politics is slowly changing, says the 62 year old Mr Terasawa.
'We have the wind behind us, and we must not miss it,' he says. He adds
attitudes of younger people are slowly changing old ways.
However, some old ways die hard. Some voters still expect favours from a
candidate. 'In the provinces, a good politician is someone who can build the
extra bridge or a bullet train station,' says Mr Terasawa.

ARSONISTS set fire to two Berlin department stores overnight yesterday but
caused little damage and no injuries, according to the police, Reuter
reports.
A police spokesman could not say whether the fires, started by incendiary
devices hidden in the stories and set off by timers, were related to
protests against Berlin's campaign to hold the Olympic Games in 2000.
Several banks supporting the Olympic campaign have been damaged by
protesters this year, and the Hertie department store chain, owner of the
two stores affected on Tuesday night, has also come out for holding the
games in Berlin.

FT  15 APR 93 / Pasqua stance on crime dismays Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first serious split emerged yesterday between France's Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand and the new centre-right government when the
president objected to a report on law and order by Mr Charles Pasqua, the
hardline interior minister.
Officials close to the president said Mr Mitterrand had 'expressed
reservations' about Mr Pasqua's presentation at a cabinet meeting of
proposals to crack down on France's rising crime rate.
The president is believed to have been concerned about Mr Pasqua's failure
to refer specifically to last week's incidents when French police killed
three youths suspected of petty crimes.
The controversy over the deaths was stoked yesterday when two police
motorcyclists in Cherbourg fired shots at a 15-year-old boy suspected of
driving a stolen car. The boy was seriously injured when one policeman,
claiming to have aimed at a car tyre, shot him in the back.
The policeman was last night under guard pending an investigation. Last
week's police killings triggered violent riots in Paris and the northern
town of Tourcoing.
Mr Pasqua, one of the most vociferously right-wing members of the new
cabinet, last weekend issued an official apology to the victims' families.
The police have begun an official inquiry into the tragedies.
However, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman, said that the interior
minister referred implicitly to the incidents at yesterday's cabinet meeting
by saying that the police must 'respect individual rights'. Mr Pasqua then
stressed the need to give police the means to curb the rise in crime.
Mr Pasqua later sought to calm the controversy. Speaking in parliament, he
repeated his apology to the bereaved families and described the police
action as 'unjustifiable'.

FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that a US brokerage had raised earnings estimates for ICI helped the
shares recover from recent sharp falls and lift 24 to 1167p yesterday.
UK analysts said PaineWebber increased its first quarter and 1993 earnings
estimates for the group. The shift was apparently on expectations that cost
cutting efforts would help to improve margins and on improved sentiment
about the UK economy.
The share price rise coincided with news that ICI's Zeneca division is to
invest Pounds 26.5m in a new production facility for its low fat protein
food Quorn. Also investors were digesting research from brokers involved in
the Zeneca hive-off ahead of the publication of the pathfinder prospectus
next Wednesday.
Word that Whitbread had revalued its property portfolio, with consequent
write-downs, weakened the shares 5 to 459p. International drinks stocks
continued to strengthen as recovery talk was heard again and brand names
worries faded. Grand Metropolitan gained 5 to 433p on turnover of 4.2m,
Guinness added 4 at 486p and Allied Lyons was steady at 562p.
Holiday tour group Owners Abroad reported that 78 per cent of ordinary
shareholders had applied for the Thomas Cook 12.5 per cent tender offer of
150p per share. In the market, the shares retreated 4 to 110p. Ironically,
arch rival Airtours gained 10 1/2 to 289 1/2 p following a statement earlier
in the week that holiday bookings at Owners were ahead of expectations.
Thorn EMI responded to talk of strong US music results. Kleinwort Benson was
also reported positive. The shares climbed 9 to 875p.
National Westminster shed 7 1/2 to 447p on profit-taking. However, HSBC
extended gains on the back of an overnight surge in the Hong Kong stock
market to record highs. The Hang Seng index was up 360 points, 5.62 per
cent, on the announcement that China and Britain have agreed to hold talks
to resolve the bitter row over local political reforms. HSBC was up 14 in
London pre-trading, although the gain was trimmed later and HSBC ordinaries
closed 8 up at 631p.
A gloomy trading statement from the chairman prompted British Vita to fall 6
to 223p.
Waste Management International lifted 30 to 544p, boosted by a trading
statement from its US parent late on Tuesday. Waste Management Inc said it
was comfortable that first quarter earnings and those of its publicly traded
subsidiaries would be in line with analysts' estimates. It expects to report
first quarter net earnings next week in the range of Dollars 0.40 to Dollars
0.41 per share.
Nervousness over impending first quarter results in the oil sector combined
with the declining price of Brent crude impacted on the majors. BP fell 3
1/2 to 301p while Shell lost 2 at 582p.
Shares in Mirror Group Newspapers, which was floated almost two years ago,
held comfortably above their 125p issue price consolidating Tuesday's
breakthrough to close 4 up at 131p.
The electricity and water sectors were the worst performers in the market as
the move out of defensive and into recovery stocks continued. Waters were
also suffering from their all-time relative high rating and consequent take
profit advice from brokers.
In waters, Anglian declined 11 to 527p and Severn Trent 9 to 515p. Among the
RECs, London tumbled 15 to 484p and Yorkshire 13 to 539p.
Food group Cadbury-Schweppes surged 10 to 480p as Smith New Court reiterated
its buy recommendation, believing the stock to have been left behind and on
the back of good figures from Coca-Cola.
The patchy recovery in food retail stocks continued, Argyll Group leading
the charge. The shares jumped 11 to 334p. Elsewhere, Iceland Frozen Foods
added 11 to 680p and Kwik Save 6 to 750p.
Sparkling figures from Tie Rack sent the shares forward 10 to 126p. A
positive Mr Paul Deakin at Goldman Sachs said: 'On my earnings forecasts for
next year, the stock stands at a 15 per cent discount to the market - but it
should really be at a significant premium.'
Coats Viyella was 3 firmer at 240p as UBS reiterated its buy stance.
Alexandra Workwear jumped 9 to 128p after the company announced improved
profits. for the year to January 31 of Pounds 1.7m against a Pounds 0.5m.
loss previously. The manufacturer and supplier of overalls, medical and
office clothing also announced a raised dividend. Alexandra said it had cut
staff closed a factory and frozen prices.
Concern about the accountancy practices at TI Group following the Tuesday's
publication of the its annual report and accounts prompted the shares to
retreat 7 to 303p.
Bargain-hunting continued to drive Siebe forward and the shares put on 10 at
475p. General investment demand boosted both Smiths Industries and Glynwed
International. The former put on 4 at 328p, while the latter added 3 at
292p.
Trafalgar House ordinaries edged a halfpenny forward to 79 1/2 and the 'A's
put on 2 at 79p after Hongkong Land said it had increased its holding in
Trafalgar to 25.1 per cent rather than its previously indicated figure of
around 29 per cent.
Recommendations from Kleinwort Benson and Robert Fleming boosted
international trading group Inchcape and the shares rose 4 to 605p.
Bargain hunters and vague talk of a predator helped Morgan Crucible bounce 7
to 269p.

FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BOC tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial gases and healthcare group BOC saw its shares fall on worries
that a US competitor is poised to grab market share following January's
expiry of BOC's patent in the US on Forane anaesthetic gas.
Investment bank BZW was telling clients that Abbott Laboratories of the US
had developed a version of the BOC product which was rapidly penetrating
Forane's US market. The house has left its forecasts unchanged but is
expected to reduce them over the next few days.
However, Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said: 'Even if they lost half
the market share to generics it would only reduce earnings per share by 2p
to 48p. The effect is pretty well in the share price by now.' BOC is
expected to fight for its old Forane market share with a new product,
Suprane, which received FDA approval in September and is now in the early
stage of marketing. BOC shares closed 16 lower at 707p with 2.5m traded.

FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Al-Fayeds sell Sears stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Al-Fayed brothers set the seal on weeks of speculation yesterday as they
unloaded their stake in stores group Sears. Market analysts put losses to
the House of Fraser owners at over Pounds 60m on a 10.6 per cent stake they
first began building five years ago at an average price said to be around
140p a share.
The 156m shares were bought by Goldman Sachs at around 100p and sold into
the market at 101p a share in a bought deal. The Sears share price ticked
off slowly during the day, opening at 105p and slipping to the major placing
price of 101p by the close.
However, it was unclear whether the broker had sold the entire stake. Some
dealers suggested that Goldman was still holding around 10m Sears shares. A
spokeswoman for the house said the placing was oversubscribed and the bulk
of the shares got away successfully. The final total recorded on SEAQ,
taking into account both sides of the deal was 309m.
The deal had been hinted in the market for several weeks as talk of various
brokers involved in pre-placing exercises did the rounds, suggesting stiff
competition for the business. The shares were said by dealers to have been
placed with institutions, although it will not be known whether any other
group has taken the opportunity to acquire a large chunk of the stock.

FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures traded in a tight 21-point range as hopes of a cut in
interest rates began to fade, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,869, 4
points ahead of its previous close, and was quickly driven higher. It was
trading at 2,874 within half an hour of the opening.
However, that early demand soon faded leaving the June contract to drift
lower. By 11am it had fallen to 2,860. The release of favourable
manufacturing output figures helped steady it but there was no advance as
dealers came to the view there may after all be no immediate lowering of
interest rates.
A weak gilts sector saw the contract retreat further during the afternoon
and it closed at the day's low of 2,853, some 12 points below Tuesday's
close. Volume remained thin and closed at 5,210 down on the previous total
of 6,328.
The expiry of the April stock options was the main feature in the traded
options and it contributed to the day's total turnover of 37,899 lots. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 6,851 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 4,527
contracts.
British Gas was the busiest stock option with 3,117 lots, though it had no
April series due for expiry. The rest of the days main trades did. Some
2,680 lots were dealt in Asda and 2,145 in Marks and Spencer. Trafalgar
House and Boots were also busy.

FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market struggles after large placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACING of a large stake in Sears, one of the UK market's most important
retailing groups, proved the high point in an otherwise subdued London
equity market.
Apart from a burst of interest triggered by the Sears placing the wider
market did little more than mark time. Senior traders pointing out another
session of low attendance, attributed to many dealers taking an extended
Easter holiday break.
The probability of another nationwide rail strike on Friday did little to
encourage enthusiasm in the market. 'Many of the important trading houses
have written off the week and will not open any sizeable positions until
next week,' said the head of trading at one of the big international dealing
houses.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the session a net 4.7 lower at 2,842.1, again
outperforming the FT-SE Mid 250 index which closed 8.6 down at 3,092.7.
Turnover on the London market was substantially inflated by the placing of
the 10.6 per cent stake in Sears, which, allowing for double counting, spoke
for more than 300m of the market's 822m shares traded yesterday. The Sears
stake, built up by the Al-Fayed brothers in 1987 was acquired and then sold
on to a number of institutions, by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank via
a bought deal thought to have netted the US investment bank a profit of
around Pounds 1.5m. Despite the low attendance levels on Tuesday, the value
of customer business in the equity managed to top the crucial Pounds 1bn
mark, reaching a creditable Pounds 1.026bn.
The equity market began the trading session in good form, with dealers
hoisting opening prices after the latest improvement on Wall Street which
followed up Tuesday's 31 points surge with a rise of almost 16 points.
However, dealers said the Sears placing, which they described as the
equivalent of a Pounds 150m rights issue, took the steam out of the market
which, having improved over nine points within the first hour of trading,
came under pressure for the rest of the day.
Another strong opening by Wall Street, which which was a good 11 points
higher soon after it opened, failed to galvanise a London market looking
increasingly weary as the session wore on. At its worst, the Footsie 100 was
down 8.5 points at 2,838.3.
Marketmakers said the slide was not wholly down to the big Sears placing.
'There were a number of big lines of stock on offer, and that unsettled the
market nearly as much as the placing of Sears,' said one trader. He added
that despite the generally good news on European interest rates there was a
feeling that the equity market would now struggle to make any further
headway.
The utilities areas of the market continued to attract strong selling
pressure with the big institutions said to have switched out of the water
and electricity areas and back into the food manufacturing, retailing and
brewing areas of the market.
Drug stocks, mauled in recent weeks by a succession of bad news, staged a
good recovery led by ICI.
Hong Kong-related stocks, which continued to surge ahead on Hong Kong
markets after the agreement between the Chinese and British governments to
resume talks about the 1995 elections, remained in the forefront of the
Footsie 100 index.

EQUITIES settled lower as institutional investors and dealers took profits
in the afternoon amid active trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average retreated 206.91 to 20,533.38 after a high of 20,874.71
and a low of 20,470.33. The broader Topix index of all first section issues
shed 15.96 to settle at 1,592,80 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 3.6 to 1,260.88. Most investors remain bullish, and describe the
decline as a temporary break.
Volume was estimated at 850m shares, compared with Tuesday's 784.6m.
Advances edged declines by 539 to 535, with 121 issues unchanged. The Nikkei
average is expected to retain its upward trend until it reaches 21,500,
which is seen as a resistance level by some chart analysts.
Beyond this level, said Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at
Nikko Securities, selling pressure is likely to come from Japanese
corporations which invested in tokkin funds, or specified money trusts,
which declined in value last year. Companies, including leading trading
houses, are also said to be offloading their 'zaiteku' or financial
engineering investments.
Large capitalisations stocks lost ground with Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, easing Y7 to Y402.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y30,000 to close at an intraday low of
Y1.04m.
The financial sector suffered broad losses on profit-taking: Sakura Bank
shed Y70 to Y1,440, Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y60 to Y2,640 and the
Bank of Tokyo declined Y30 to Y1,310.
Profit-taking also pushed the export sector lower with Sony declining Y20 to
Y4,980 and TDK settling down Y20 to Y4,100.
In spite of the session's losses, the government's plan to strengthen its
telecommunications infrastructure gave a boost to Tamura Electric Works, the
telecom equipment maker, which gained Y50 to Y794.
Suzuki Motor benefited from motorcycle demand in China, finishing Y12 higher
at Y986.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 39.72 to close at 22,153.10 in volume of
39.4m shares.
Roundup
SENIOR Pacific Rim markets turned in record performances. Bombay was closed
for a holiday.
HONG KONG surged to a record closing high, with investors taking the view
that a resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's future was nothing
but good news.
The Hang Seng index rose 371.53 or 5.79 per cent to finish at 6,789.74,
after an intraday peak of 6,805.66. In subsequent London trading, prices
closed at the equivalent of a further 50 point rise in the index.
Hong Kong turnover was also at a record, reaching HKDollars 7.7bn, compared
with a previous high of HKDollars 6.4bn set last May.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London believes that the market is now
poised to breach the 7,000 level on the Hang Seng, and that a successful
conclusion to the Beijing talks would take the index up to 7,200.
Among blue chips leading the rise, Jardine Matheson rose HKDollars 7, or 15
per cent, to HKDollars 55. The British-controlled trading group has lagged
behind the market since Beijing criticised it late last year for supporting
the governor's democratic reform drive. HSBC Holdings was the most active
stock, adding HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 73.50 while Cheung Kong, the property
group, rose HKDollars 1.20 to HKDollars 23.70.
AUSTRALIAN stocks finished at a three-year high with the All Ordinaries
index adding 15.7 to 1,704.4 in turnover of ADollars 310.1m.
Hong Kong's strong showing provided some stimulus while metal stocks came to
the fore on hopes that Japan's economic recovery package would improve
demand. Among mining stocks, MIM gained 7 cents to ADollars 2.24 and BHP
climbed 14 cents to ADollars 15.08.
SINGAPORE closed higher in record volume of 431.79m shares. The Straits
Times industrial index rose 15.10 to 1,708.61 in brisk trading of Malaysian
shares.
SEOUL, however, saw aggressive profit-taking across the board after the
recent bull run and the composite index fell 15.60 to 704.92 in turnover of
Won887bn.
The mood was unsettled by the resignation of the president's top aide which
triggered concern that discontent in the ruling party might lead to
political unrest.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow consolidated by good
company results

Wall Street
US share prices firmed slightly in moderate trading yesterday, as more
companies reported their first quarter earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.61 at 3,455.64. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.56 at 448.66, while
the Amex composite ended up 0.01 at 420.52 and the Nasdaq composite 0.11
higher at 673.94. Trading volume on the NYSE was relatively light at 257m
shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,022 to 881.
In the absence of fresh economic data, and with Treasury prices mostly flat,
equity investors looked to quarterly corporate earnings for a lead. Although
the reporting season has only just got under way, the early indications are
that first quarter profits will be in line with, or slightly better than,
analysts' forecasts, with a few notable exceptions.
A good set of first quarter reports is vital to ensure that stock market
sentiment remains positive. Recent economic figures, if anything, have
indicated that the pace of the recovery may be slowing down. This may be
good news on the inflation front, but it suggests that corporate earnings,
which have been steadily improving over the past year, might tail off later
in 1993.
Companies manufacturing well-known consumer products ran into selling after
Procter&amp;Gamble announced late on Tuesday that it planned to slash prices on
its most popular brand of disposable diapers.
Coming on the heels of Philip Morris' recent decision to cut prices on its
famous Marlboro cigarette brand, the Procter&amp;Gamble move revived fears that
competition for consumer loyalty could hurt once seemingly price-insensitive
brand-name products.
Procter&amp;Gamble shares fell more than Dollars 1 at the opening, before
recovering to end Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 48 1/4 . Kimberly-Clark,
which is Procter&amp;Gamble's main competitor in the disposable diaper market,
dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 .
Other consumer stocks were mixed, with Colgate-Palmolive ending unchanged at
Dollars 62 1/8 , Gillette down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56, and RJR Nabisco
Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 5 3/4 .
Several large cyclical stocks fared well. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing
climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 113 3/8 , International Paper added Dollars
 5/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 , Allied Signal firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 3/4
and General Electric rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 94 1/4 .
Wal-Mart dropped another Dollars 2 to Dollars 27 1/4 in volume of 10.3m
shares after analysts were disappointed by the retailer's projections of
future sales growth at a meeting in New York. Marriott firmed Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 26 after reporting a sharp rise in net income to Dollars 49m,
while Hilton fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 after reporting
essentially flat first quarter profits. Canada
TORONTO prices closed slightly higher in heavy trading helped by a strong
showing among gold stocks. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300
composite index rose 5.01 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at 3,629.85.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 361 to 311.
Newbridge Networks jumped 1 5/8 to CDollars 77 5/8 as the company said it
received a contract to supply intelligent digital networking equipment for
New York Telephone's new NYNEX Enterprise Services network.
Brascan said a group of banks led by Chemical Bank has asked a British court
to rule whether its recent secondary offering of shares of John Labatt
violated the terms of the USDollars 500m of debentures held by the banks.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bermuda plans focus on Hong Kong and
insurers - Much play is being made of its possibilities as an offshore
equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financiers in the tiny island of Bermuda are moving ahead with plans to
upgrade operations at the local stock exchange, in a bid to establish a new
centre for international equity trading.
Local banks, which still own the exchange, are hoping to develop the island
as a shadow of the Hong Kong stock market, taking advantage of the fact that
over 100 Hong Kong companies have already registered there.
Much play, too, is being made of the island's possibilities as a centre for
trading in the shares of new offshore international insurance companies,
which have made their domicile in Bermuda in recent years.
'We would be the only international offshore stock exchange in the western
hemisphere,' says Mr Charles Vaughan-Johnson, executive vice-president at
the Bank of Bermuda. 'You can see the potential if it becomes fully
modernised. For those who don't want to be in Luxembourg (a rival
international centre) it will have enormous appeal.'
Mr Vaughan-Johnson's vision is an ambitious one. Only 26 equity issues
(including common and preference shares), and four note and bond issues are
currently traded on the exchange. Over a dozen other mutual funds are listed
but not traded. Capitalisation amounts to a respectable Dollars 802m
according to Mr Bill Dolan, a manager at the Bank of Bermuda, who has been
co-ordinating the modernisation effort.
But a handful of stocks, notably the Banks of Bermuda and Butterfield,
Bermuda Telephone and Bermuda Electric Light, account for the lion's share.
The two banks alone have a capitalisation of more than Dollars 485m between
them.
Nevertheless the banks are optimistic and can point to real progress in the
last few months. In February this year Bermuda finally scrapped its system
of weekly trading. This had centred on the 'open cryer' method involving the
three banks that own the exchange: the Banks of Butterfield and Bermuda, and
the smaller Bermuda Commercial Bank.
Each Tuesday three numbered ping pong balls were drawn by bank
representatives to establish the order in which they would make their bids
that week.
The banks are still the only members but screen-based trading, conducted
over the telephone, was introduced on February 24, with the index rebased to
1,000. Two months on the index has dipped to 982.69, with trading generally
within a narrow range.
Mr Dolan is currently reviewing the exchange's constitution, with a view to
establishing a new incorporated entity, easing membership rules and bringing
the exchange within the supervisory authority of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority.
Immediate objectives include efforts to persuade managers of over a hundred
mutual funds currently registered in Bermuda to list on the exchange. In the
medium term Mr Dolan is aiming to introduce an electronic settlement system,
in order to increase efficiency.
In the long-term, however, prospects are closely linked to the island's
future as the favoured offshore centre for both Hong Kong companies and the
insurance business.
Jardine Mattheson, the trading company, was one of the first Hong Kong
companies to register in Bermuda in 1984, and some 130 Hong Kong companies
have followed suit. More recently the growth of a number of offshore
insurance and reinsurance companies has opened up another opportunity.
Since 1985 three companies which between them have net assets of over
Dollars 2bn have been established in Bermuda. Of these, ACE and EXEL were
originally owned by the large US corporations whose liability risks they
insure, but both have launched successful share issues in New York within
the last two years while a third, Centre Re, is planning to follow suit.
Within the last six months two more companies - Mid Ocean and Underwriting
Capital (Merrett) - have also been formed in Bermuda, and more new ventures
are expected.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment varies as Swiss
exporters decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOODS varied among bourses yesterday, as strategists continued to look for a
new theme after the strong European performance in the first quarter, writes
Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH was led lower by exporters in response to the weak dollar. The SMI
index shed 16.10 to 2,165.7 with the fall limited by a firm financial
sector, still hoping for lower interest rates.
'The decline does seem to be rather an over-reaction to the weaker dollar,'
said Miss Felicity Smith at Hoare Govett in London. 'But trading volume was
fairly low, which may indicate that prices were being marked down by local
traders rather than as a result of institutional selling.'
Among exporters, Ciba-Geigy bearers, SFr10 lower at SFr637, were actively
traded. Analysts suggested that the fall had more to do with currency
considerations than the group's announcement of a 4 per cent fall in first
quarter sales.
Sandoz, the chemical and pharmaceutical group, shed SFr40 to SFr2,910, the
uncertain outlook for US sales continuing to weigh on the shares. Nestle,
still suffering from US doubts about the value of brands, saw its bearers
fall SFr20 to SFr1,145.
PARIS took time off after Tuesday's strong performance, although leading
banks shaved 25 basis points off base rates following an easing in the repo
rate. The CAC-40 index eased 2.65 to 2,015.43 in turnover of FFr2.06bn.
There were mixed feelings in the financial sector, with Paribas gaining
FFr1.40 to FFr426.20 and Societe Generale losing FFr4 to FFr640.
Lyonnaise Dumez lost FFr2.00 to FFr486.70 after reporting lower 1992 profits
and plans for a capital increase for its construction division later this
year.
FRANKFURT saw its post-holiday torpor evaporate a little around the
construction sector, although the statements which provoked this were a few
days old.
Turnover fell from DM4.7bn to DM4bn as the DAX index rose 1.39 to 1,672.44.
Mr Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities pointed to a positive statement on
housing development from Germany's construction minister. Meanwhile, Philipp
Holzmann, up DM17 to DM1,074, was also lifted by a good interim report; and
a leak that forthcoming results will be better than expected left
Heidelberger Zement DM35 higher at DM1,090.
AMSTERDAM witnessed another startling performance from Begemann, the
industrial conglomerate, which put on nearly 20 per cent to close Fl 8.50
higher at Fl 51.50. Analysts could cite no particular reason for the rise,
although some short covering was noted. The CBS Tendency index gained 0.6 to
109.2.
MILAN marked time in largely technical trade ahead of the end of the account
on Friday and as options contracts expired yesterday. The Comit index dipped
0.70 to 512.31 as volume declined ahead of this weekend's political reform
referendum.
Fiat, planning temporary lay-offs next month in response to sluggish sales,
fell L59 to fix at L6,261 before L6,270 after hours.
Among privatisation candidates, banks were easier but Sme, the foods group,
picked up L156 to L6,130 as employees, protesting against the sell-off,
ended their occupation of the group's headquarters allowing managers to
collect together the information necessary for the auction.
Mondadori, Italy's largest publisher, rose L100 to L10,900 after reports
that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest is considering the merger and
flotation of its main publishing activities.
VIENNA lost 1.2 per cent with the ATX index closing down 9.33 at 779.86.
COPENHAGEN was encouraged by hopes of a cut in the domestic repo rate and
the KFX index gained 1.40 or 1.8 per cent to 83.51. Unidanmark led the
risers with a rise of DKr12 or 8.3 per cent to DKr157.
DUBLIN continued its upward career with the ISEQ overall index rising
another 21.15 to 1,572.51.

FT  15 APR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling futures fell sharply yesterday after
better-than-expected figures for UK industrial production quashed fledgling
hopes of another cut in UK base rates, writes James Blitz.
There had been slight optimism at the start of the week about a near-term
rate cut following sterling's strong performance on the foreign exchange
markets.
However, yesterday's industrial production figures for February, which
showed a 1.6 per cent rise in the month came as a complete surprise to the
market.
There was an especially strong focus on the figure for manufacturing output,
which showed a 1.2 per cent rise against forecasts of 0.2 per cent.
As a result, the June short sterling contract fell 12 basis points from its
opening level to bottom out at 94.13, before closing at 94.15. The September
contract fell even more heavily, by some 19 basis points, to a low of 94.20
before closing at 94.22.
The 94.22 figure was the high point of the futures yield curve. Dealers were
effectively pricing in no moves in base rates below 6 per cent.
Rates in the cash market firmed by around  1/16 of a percentage point in the
wake of the UK data. Three-month sterling deposit rates closed at around 5
15/16 per cent from around 5 27/32 per cent on Tuesday night.
The rise in cash rates was remarkable considering the very small shortage of
Pounds 450m forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day.
One dealer said that the raft of recent good news on the UK economy had
removed any hope of another cut in base rates. The deposit rate yield curve
closed flat last night with the bid rate at 6 per cent from 1 month out to 1
year.
Another dealer suggested that bullishness could re-emerge if sterling breaks
through the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark. He said that conditions in the
discount market would make it unlikely that deposit rates would rise far
above 6 per cent.
In Europe, the 2 basis point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate depressed
sentiment in French and German futures markets.
With the rate for 14-day funds reduced to 8.11 per cent, the June Euromark
contract fell 7 basis points to close at 92.77. The September contract fell
9 basis points to close at 93.65.

FT  15 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rallies against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING rose one-and-a-half pfennigs against the D-Mark in yesterday's
European trading, following the release of more strong data for the UK
economy, writes James Blitz.
After rising 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark on Tuesday, yesterday's
industrial production figures, showing a 1.6 per cent rise in February after
a fall of 0.1 per cent in January, enhanced the bullish mood.
The pound rose from about DM2.4650 to peak at about DM2.4775 at lunchtime in
London, immediately after the figures were released. Sterling later closed
at DM2.4700, a net rise of  3/4 of a pfennig on the day. The currency's
trade weighted index, which compares sterling with its 1985 value against a
basket of currencies closed at 80.8 per cent, up 0.4 percentage points on
the day.
Several dealers suggested the pound could move higher from current levels.
However, Mr Mike Gallagher, Director of Economic Research at IDEA in London,
cautioned that sterling may be capped by the Bank of England's purchase of
currencies in the foreign exchange market.
He noted that UK reserves had fallen by Dollars 1.7bn in March when the Bank
is thought to have repaid loans received to support its currency in the
run-up to Black Wednesday last year. Mr Gallagher said there were rumours
that the Bank had been buying foreign currencies in recent days to make up
the loss.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, also
cautioned that the pound might fall back today when the Maastricht treaty is
debated in the House of Commons. After several weeks of consistent strength,
the yen weakened against the dollar yesterday following Tuesday's
announcement of a Y13,200bn economic package aimed at reviving Japan's
troubled economy.
After hitting a new record high of Y112.58 against the US currency on Monday
morning, the yen depreciated to a close of Y113.95 in Europe last night.
According to Mr Hawkins of Bank of America, this week's fiscal stimulus is
the first indication from the Japanese that they will reduce their huge
trade surplus with the US by boosting their economy and sucking in American
imports rather than by letting the yen appreciate.
The yen may also have weakened with the passing of the financial year-end in
Japan, which saw much repatriation of the Japanese currency.
The dollar gained a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, despite a very
small cut in the interest rate at which the Bundesbank offers wholesale
funds to commercial banks.
The cut in the repo rate by 2 basis points to 8.11 per cent failed to stop
the dollar rising to a close of DM1.5915 from a previous DM1.5790. One
analyst said there had been profit- taking by dealers with short dollar
positions following the recent sell-off of the US currency.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although no wool sales are being held this week, the last ones held in all
main markets, including British wool itself, show that 'the crippling
imbalance between supply and demand' remains the dominant feature. Prices
are weak and tended to ease at closing auctions. Business further down the
wool textile manufacturing line inevitably takes this into account, and
small covering orders are held till the last minute. Recession in Europe is
damaging and enhances competition, and signs of recovery in the UK are not
of sufficient strength to counteract wider weakness.

Three-month COPPER prices fell sharply in late LME trading, closing weak and
just above Dollars 2,000 a tonne, with the decline pulling other metals
lower. New York's Comex copper futures were more than 2 cents a lb down by
midday. London dealers said late selling pressure and liquidation appeared
to be a fresh attempt to push the market below Dollars 2,000 and trigger
lurking sell stops. Although the market held above this level in initial
after-hours trading, traders were wary of a downward break, as all the signs
suggested that the Dollars 2,000-Dollars 2,050 range was unlikely to hold.
LME ZINC also fell away during late afternoon trading. Overhead resistance
above Dollars 1,050 a tonne for three-month metal eventually proved too
strong, dealers said. The market was also correcting downwards after rising
some Dollars 50 in a straight line on Tuesday, while the Chinese production
cuts which emerged overnight were not as large as many traders had expected.
Production at two Chinese zinc-lead smelters is to be cut by 10,000 tonnes
of zinc and 20,000 tonnes of lead per year. New York COTTON prices were
sharply ahead by midday on fund buying.

FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS smelters marshal their
defences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday
set up an organisation to promote and defend its operations internationally.
Several western companies are represented on the International Aluminium
Committee, which will be based in St Petersburg and have liaison offices in
Brussels and New York. One of its most urgent tasks will be to put the CIS
industry's case to the European Commission, which is considering whether it
should set draconian quotas for CIS aluminium imports.
Virtually all the CIS smelters are represented on the new committee as well
as Concern Aluminiy, the central holding company, whose president, Mr Igor
Prokopov is chairman of the new organisation. Among the western companies,
all of them suppliers to the CIS industry, are the AIOC Corporation, a New
York-based trading company; Granges, the Swedish aluminium group; Joseph
Muller of Switzerland; Kaiser, the US aluminium group; the Kumera
Corporation, a Finnish equipment supplier; and Reynolds Metals, another big
US group.
Mr Sam Manaktala, a Kaiser director who has been appointed a director of the
new organisation, said the western companies' role was to act as advisers to
an organisation which would in concept be similar to the European Aluminium
Association or the American Aluminium Association. 'It will consist of
people with similar objectives, working together. If the Russian aluminium
industry can organise itself in a structured way it will be good for them
and good for the rest of the world's aluminium industry.'
The IAC aims to help attract more foreign investment in the CIS industry,
both at the smelters and in downstream operations. In the longer term the
committee will help the integration of the CIS into the world industry.
Some of the Russian members said they were concerned about the poor image of
the CIS industry being projected internationally and recognised that they
needed an organisation to put their industry's case.
The new organisation has only a few weeks in which to influence the European
Commission's inquiry. Some western aluminium producers have complained that
their smelters have been operating unprofitably for two years and their very
existence is threatened because of a surge in CIS aluminium exports since
1991. They estimate that 600,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium entered the EC last
year and 450,000 tonnes in 1991 compared with an annual average of 82,000
tonnes before 1990.
The commission is inquiring into their complaints under rules that allow
measures to 'safeguard' EC industry. These rules permit the imposition of
quotas or tariffs. The European Aluminium Association is understood to be
pressing for an annual quota of 82,000 tonnes to be imposed, the 'normal'
level before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Genetically improved pig comes
to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOAR guaranteed to be free from a gene that can lead to poor quality pork
was launched on to the market in London yesterday by the Lincolnshire-based
Cotswold Pig Development Company.
The company claims that the UK pig industry would benefit by Pounds 52m a
year if it switched to the new pig. British pig production is worth about
Pounds 1bn a year at the farm gate.
The so-called halothane gene has been known about since the 1920s. It could
be detected only through a pig's reaction to halothane, a human anaesthetic,
until the University of Toronto published a DNA genetic fingerprint in 1991.
Mr John Webb, director of genetics at Cotswold, said yesterday that the
company since 1983 had been breeding a line of pigs in an attempt to
eliminate the gene. It had succeeded in reducing the percentage showing a
positive reaction to the halothane test from nearly 90 per cent in 1983 to
just 3 per cent by 1991, when the company was perfectly poised to take
advantage of the DNA test and eliminate it entirely.
The halothane gene had become widespread because carriers produced leaner
meat than non-carriers, he said. However, it could lead to stress in the
animal, whose meat then became what is known as pale, soft and exudative
(PSE) after slaughter. This made it unattractive to supermarkets and reduced
its shelf life.
Mr Webb claimed that the new boar - the Cotswold 30 - would benefit
producers and processors by providing a better yield, retailers and
consumers by providing better quality meat, and the pig by reducing stress.
Its production did not involve genetic engineering but used genetic breeding
simply to eliminate a problem.
Cotswold has an annual turnover of Pounds 20m and is the second biggest pig
breeding company in the UK industry, which is a world leader. Mr Robin
Shannon, managing director, said yesterday that half the company's
production was exported, mainly to the EC, North America and Japan.
The company has plans to sell about 500 Cotswold 30 boars this year.

FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum prices up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasing tension in South African cities pushed platinum prices up in
both London and New York yesterday, writes Our Commodities Staff. In London
speculative buying and short covering took the price to more than Dollars
370 a troy ounce in late trading, the highest since early February. Nymex
July futures jumped Dollars 9.60 to Dollars 372 in early trading. 'The
market is a bit thin and small parcels can exaggerate price moves,' one
dealer said. South Africa supplies about 75 per cent of western world
platinum, which is used principally in jewellery, autocatalysts and
electronics.

ban angers EC

CENTRAL EUROPEAN countries' attempts to ban imports of livestock and dairy
products from the European Community were condemned as 'unacceptable'
yesterday by Mr Rene Steichen, the EC's agriculture commissioner.
The community last week imposed a one-month ban on imports of live animals,
meat, milk and dairy products from 18 central and east European countries
following the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in Italy, allegedly spread
from Croatian imports.
Mr Steichen told his fellow commissioners yesterday that restrictions
imposed by certain central European countries - including Poland, Hungary,
Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Czech republic - amounted to an unacceptable
political reaction to what was essentially a veterinary matter.
Hungary promptly denied that the imposition of restrictions on EC imports
was retaliation for the community ban, arguing that foot-and-mouth disease
was still present on EC territory.
EC veterinary experts, who meet on April 20 to review the ban, are satisfied
that foot-and-mouth disease has been eradicated in some ex-communist
countries.
But a commission official said yesterday that the EC was worried about east
and central European controls on exports. Fears were aroused when 200 out of
450 Czech and Slovak cattle imported into Britain were found to have been
vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease.
Vaccinated animals cannot be exported, in case they develop the disease
itself. The British imports arrived with false certificates giving them a
clear bill of health.
Commission officials said that the veterinary certificates could have been
falsified as many as three times as the cattle were transported across
eastern Europe.

FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rand fall brings shine back to
S African gold - A much-needed revenue windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAYS when South African mining houses served crayfish tails at their
results presentations are remembered only by the senior generation of
journalists and analysts. There should, however, at least be smiles on offer
when the release of the March quarterly results of the gold mining industry
commences today.
Following five years in which the rand gold price averaged less than R1,000
a troy ounce, the past six months have finally seen it break through this
barrier. Although the average price in 1992 fell by 2 per cent to R979.70 an
ounce from R999.50 in 1991 the fourth quarter average rose sharply to R1,002
an ounce from R962 in the third quarter. During the first quarter of 1993
the average price advanced further to R1,029 an ounce.
For an industry in which many producers are marginal - defined by the
Chamber of Mines as having a profit/revenue ratio of less than 5 per cent -
this revenue windfall can translate into an exponential increase in profits.
Using the 1992 average price, the Chamber of Mines estimates that 11 mines,
producing about 90 tonnes of gold - 15 per cent of the country's annual
production of 608.5 tonnes - and employing about 80,000 workers, were
marginal. At present prices, these figures will be slightly lower.
Ironically, at an industry level, the recent price strength is unlikely to
translate into significantly better profits. This is due to the increasing
portion of South African production that is hedged - about 16.5 per cent in
the December quarter according to estimates made by Ms Robinn Yale Kearney,
gold analyst at brokers Silvis Barnard Jacobs and Mellet. She points out
that the impact of the higher prices of the past quarter will be to crimp
the premium derived from hedging from 2.7 per cent during the December
quarter. If costs rise by 2 per the profit margin at the operating level,
which 20 years ago was well above 50 per cent, will remain flat at 21 per
cent, notwithstanding the 17 per cent increase in the spot rand gold price
over the past six months.
Although producers will gratefully accept improved revenue from wherever it
comes, they would clearly have preferred an improvement in the gold price to
a deterioration in the rand/dollar exchange rate. In fact, based on London
fixings, the bullion price has weakened in recent quarters - from an average
Dollars 347 an ounce in the third quarter of 1992 to Dollars 338 in the
fourth quarter and Dollars 329.4 in the first quarter of 1993. Over the same
period, however, this 5 per cent weakening in the price has been more than
offset by a 13 per cent depreciation of the rand/dollar exchange rate from
2.77, to 3.12.
The depreciation of the rand - which is expected to continue, albeit at a
slower pace - should not, however, be allowed to disguise fundamental
improvements in the health of the gold industry. A year ago Mr Gary Maude,
managing director of the Gengold group, one of the main producers, was
characterising the mood as one of 'grim determination' with survival the
watchword for many marginal mines. Now Mr Maude argues that 'the industry is
in much better shape. It is more efficient now than it was a year ago.
Changes that needed to be made have been made and unions have supported
these changes'.
Mr Maude is referring to not only to wage restraint, which has been
important, but to changes in working practices. He cites, for example,
giving responsibility to smaller working groups at the stope-face. Another
innovation, at the managerial level, being practised at Gengold's
Buffelsfontein mine is giving responsibility for the management of different
shafts to different personnel - including administrative and technical
managers. The aim is to foster improved productivity.
Such innovation is not specific to Gengold, although it has a strong claim
to being the industry leader in this respect. As a general rule, innovation
has been most forthcoming where the need has been greatest - that is, at the
marginal mines.
One of the features of the industry's performance has been the extent to
which it has contained costs. Chamber of Mines figures reveal that industry
unit costs rose by only 0.91 per cent in 1992. Consumer price inflation, by
comparison, was 14 per cent in 1992. The nagging question is whether such
improvements can be sustained without jeopardising production. One person
not in doubt is Mr Maude who comments: 'The feeling amongst my general
managers is that we haven't scratched the surface yet. We haven't really
taken advantage yet of the fact that apartheid has gone. We're a very, very
inefficient industry because we haven't used our people properly'.
An important aspect of cost control has been the introduction of
profit-sharing schemes as a quid pro quo for workers receiving low basic
wage increases. Wages account for 50 to 55 per cent of mine working costs.
Some observers, however, have reservations about the present shape of
profit-sharing arrangements which are - with notable exceptions like
Randfontein and Harmony - a function of profits, not productivity.
Some argue that this is only proper given that workers had been forced to
accept low increases because the weak gold price didn't allow for any more.
Critics respond by asking what compensation shareholders are being offered
for their sacrifices. Chamber of Mines figures show that dividend payments
from the industry fell to R1.39bn in 1992 from R2.2bn in 1988 - a decline of
about 70 per cent in real terms.
Tough times are also reflected in capital expenditure which Ms Kearney
estimates has fallen, as a percentage of working capital, to 14.4 per cent
in December 1992 from 26 per cent five years previously. This level needs to
rise to secure future production and the improved price should aid this.

FT  15 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment climate in PNG
'still favourable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAPUA NEW Guinea was yesterday given a much-needed endorsement by MIM
Holdings, the Australian mining group, in spite of the government's
interventionist approach to foreign investment in resource projects.
Mr Norm Fussell, the MIM chief executive, said the government's recent
insistence on renegotiating major projects had provided 'ammunition to those
who believe the risk of doing business in PNG is too great'. But investment
in PNG remained attractive, especially for major projects, for which the
government had introduced a favourable economic and regulatory climate.
Mr Fussell said overseas companies' anxieties about the risks of investing
in PNG had been increased by disputes over the Porgera and Mount Kare gold
mines, secessionist fighting on Bougainville island, and law and order
problems on the mainland.
Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM, was one of three
Australian companies forced to reduce their shareholdings in the Porgera
project last month after the government insisted on renegotiating its joint
venture contract. Mr Fussell said the three companies involved in the
Porgera venture 'were reluctant to cede a significant part of a profitable
investment after having carried the risk, the exploration, and the
workload'. But MIM was not reconsidering its attitude to investment in PNG,
which also includes a commitment to oil exploration and development in the
South East Gobe oilfield.
'Once the political reality of the sale was accepted, the final negotiations
with the government resulted in a reasonable commercial outcome. And the
government itself, now with a substantial stake in the operation, is
committed to making it work well,' he said.
Mr Fussell also said that PNG's natural resources, part of the so-called
Pacific Rim of Fire, had been barely explored, in spite of the large number
of major minerals projects under way in the country. 'The geology is highly
prospective, and the gold, copper, and oil which have been revealed to date
are indicative of much more to follow,' he said.
The MIM chief executive's comments will be welcomed by the coalition
government, headed by Mr Paiais Wingti, which has adopted an aggressive
approach to PNG participation in major projects.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Bonds: Norway exploits good name with
ambitious DM1.5bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY launched an ambitious DM1.5bn bond issue yesterday at a yield of just
12 basis points over five-year German government bonds in the face of a
falling market. But support from lead-manager Deutsche Bank helped to keep
the spread at its launch level by the close, despite widening at one point
in the afternoon.
Norway, with a AA1/AAA rating, has traditionally been one of the
best-regarded names in the German market, according to one banker involved
in the deal. But he added this may not have been enough to justify such a
tight spread for a large transaction.
The bonds were launched at an indicated yield spread of 12 to 14 basis
points over the Bobl series 105, and were priced at the tight end in the
morning.
As the government market fell with the meagre cut in the German repo rate,
the spread widened to 14 or more basis points at one stage. But, according
to Deutsche, this was because brokers were failing to update prices on their
screens as the market moved.
Two Pounds 300m five-year deals from Japanese electricity companies came as
expected, though they met different initial responses. With so much paper
due, Kansai Electric Power benefited from being launched first, with SG
Warburg and BZW as joint lead managers. The bonds had a yield spread of 47
basis points over gilts - wider than expected - and were reported to have
sold well in the Far East and continental Europe. The issue moved in line
with the gilts market, which fell by half a point on signs of strengthening
in the UK economy.
Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) followed with its own Pounds 300m, five-year
transaction, but at a spread of 40 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt
due 1998. The pricing difference reflected Tepco's stronger credit standing.
Tepco has a triple-A rating from both main US agencies, compared with the
sole triple-A from Moody's for Kansai. And, as Japan's largest electricity
company, Tepco has stronger name recognition among retail investors.
But, coming after the Kansai issue and against a background of rumours that
a gilt auction in the five to 10-year maturity range would be announced at
the end of this week, the Tepco bonds found less support.
During the day, the yield spread on the bonds - Pounds 200m of which were
underwritten by lead-manager CSFB - widened to about 45 basis points,
eradicating much of the difference with Kansai. Given the traditional
pricing differential between the two companies in the bond markets, however,
the gap was thought likely to widen again over time.
With five-year sterling swap spreads at just under 50 basis points
yesterday, both issuers are thought to have swapped into floating rate
dollars at just over Libor, after taking fees into account. The Tepco swap
was handled by Sakura Bank, while Kansai's involved BZW. The proceeds of
both deals were then swapped into fixed-rate yen.

FT  15 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts lose ground as signs of recovery
dash rate-cut hopes

THE UK government bond market lost nearly a point yesterday as the latest
indications of recovery in the UK economy dashed hopes of further interest
rate cuts.
Yesterday saw the release of better-than-expected manufacturing output
figures and a relatively favourable Treasury report on the economy.
Manufacturing output rose 1.2 per cent in February after a revised 1.3 per
cent rise in January, whereas economists had forecast a much smaller rise of
only 0.2 per cent. Industrial output rose 1.6 per cent in February,
following a 0.1 per cent fall in the previous month, whereas a rise of 0.5
per cent had been expected.
The Treasury report pointed to an improvement in demand and activity, while
adding that inflationary pressures remained subdued.
Sterling remained strong yesterday, trading at DM2.4723 to DM2.4733, against
DM2.4616 to DM2.4648 the previous day. Among short-dated issues, the 7 1/4
per cent gilt due 1998 fell  21/32 to 101 3/4 , while at the long end of the
market the 8 per cent gilt due 2013 fell  29/32 to 46 7/8 .
Dealers said the market expected the Bank of England to announce its next
gilt auction tomorrow.
THE Bundesbank disappointed the German government bond market as it allowed
only a small easing in its repo rate yesterday, leading to a fall in bund
prices.
The rate was lowered from 8.13 per cent to 8.11 per cent at the central
bank's latest allocation of 14-day securities repurchase agreements, whereas
many bond market participants had hoped for a more generous easing.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 96.52 and, after reaching a high
of 96.60, it gradually fell back to a low of 96.21, ending the day at about
96.23.
The weaker German government bond market helped to pull down other main
European bond markets, including France and Italy.
Dealers reported profit-taking in the Italian market, despite the relative
strength of the lira. The BTP futures contract fell from 95.36 to 94.90.
SPANISH government bonds recovered recent losses, with the yield on the
10-year benchmark bond falling from 11.71 per cent to 11.61 per cent.
IN THE absence of fresh economic statistics, US Treasury prices traded
firmer yesterday after the Federal Reserve completed the coupon pass dealers
had been hoping for.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 104
23/32 , yielding 6.752 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.757 per cent.
At the opening, prices drew strength from buying on foreign markets
overnight, but failed to match the gains earned on Monday and early Tuesday,
when the market advanced strongly in response to good inflation news. The
main focus of the day was the possibility that the Fed might go into the
market and purchase coupon securities outright (in a manoeuvre known as a
coupon pass) to bolster the banking system's reserves.
In the event, the Fed did take some supply out of the market, by buying
coupons with maturities of November 1993 and beyond. Although prices
fluctuated temporarily after the coupon pass, the market eventually settled
down.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose in futures-driven trading yesterday,
prompted by signs of profit-taking in the stock market.
The futures contract opened at 108.29 and rallied to a high of 108.75. The
contract ended in Tokyo at 108.63, but picked up again in the London session
to trade at 108.68. Dealers are waiting to see if the futures contract will
test the next resistance point of 109.01 soon.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.25 per cent and moved in a
range of 4.195-4.265 per cent, before ending the day at 4.205 per cent.
Dealers said the bond market took its cue from falling stock prices, as the
Nikkei average index closed down 206.01 points, or 1.00 per cent, at
20,533.38 after Tuesday's strong rally.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Derivative portfolios held by
UK banks up sharply in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange and interest-rate related derivatives operations of UK
clearing banks grew rapidly last year, with total portfolios growing more
than 50 per cent, according to banks' annual reports.
The derivative markets also provided the only significant growth in UK
banks' credit exposures: those banks to disclose details recorded a jump of
nearly Pounds 4bn in their risk-weighted assets as a result of their
off-balance sheet derivatives operations.
By comparison, three of the four main clearing banks - Barclays, Lloyds and
Midland - saw a decline in risk-weighted assets recorded on their balance
sheets as they continued to reel from heavy provisions from their UK
lending. Barclays showed the sharpest decline, from Pounds 86.3bn to Pounds
84.9bn.
The growth in derivatives portfolios stemmed both from doing more business
with institutional and corporate customers and from using derivatives more
for internal position-taking, said Mr Barry Hamilton, head of risk
management in Barclays' treasury division. Interest rate swaps, for
instance, are a less capital-intensive way of hedging or increasing interest
rate exposure than the traditional money markets, he said.
The nominal amounts involved in the contracts, though not indicating true
exposures, give the clearest indication of growth in the banks' derivatives
businesses. These show a jump both in exchange-rate and interest-rate
related instruments, though the UK commercial banks remain behind their US
counterparts.
The risk-weighted amounts, calculated according to Bank for International
Settlements guidelines, reflect the mark-to-market value of derivatives
portfolios. Their faster growth rate suggests the banks were not running
balanced portfolios last year, but have benefited from falling interest
rates or from foreign exchange movements.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus has been flowing back into the global money
market, with short-term funds going mainly to the Euromarket, says the Bank
of Japan (BOJ), Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Japan's current account surplus rose to Dollars 117.6bn in 1992, from
Dollars 72.9bn in 1991. Long-term capital outlays showed a deficit of
Dollars 28.5bn in 1992, against a surplus of Dollars 37.1bn the previous
year.
The change in long-term capital outlays was due to a change in the ratio of
inward and outward investment in stocks and bonds, BOJ said.
Inward and outward investment in stocks and bonds showed a Dollars 26.2bn
net deficit in 1992 against a Dollars 41.0bn surplus in 1991. Capital flows
such as short-term capital flows and private banking accounts had a Dollars
78.6bn deficit last year against Dollars 102.2bn in 1991.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Gannett lifted by increased

IMPROVED newspaper advertising revenues helped Gannett, the US publisher of
82 daily newspapers including USA Today, to achieve a first-quarter 1993 net
profit of Dollars 66.3m, or 46 cents a share, compared with a loss in the
same quarter of 1992 of Dollars 91.4m, or 63 cents a share.
The company's 1992 first-quarter loss occurred after Dollars 146m of
accounting charges. With these stripped out, the 1993 first-quarter net
profit was 22 per cent higher than the level a year before.
Gannett's group operating revenues grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 844.7m
year-on-year, while operating income was Dollars 120.1m in the first
quarter, some 16 per cent higher than the level a year ago.
Newspaper advertising revenues were 9 per cent higher in the 1993 first
quarter, at Dollars 465m. Classified advertising volume was nearly 6 per
cent better in the quarter.
Signs that the US media industry is emerging from the worst of recession
were apparent at USA Today, the popular national daily paper. Its paid
advertising pages rose by 29 per cent year-on-year while advertising
revenues were 21 per cent better.
Broadcasting revenues at Gannett, which includes 10 television and 15 radio
stations in the US, grew by 5 per cent, to Dollars 82.9m.
Outdoor advertising revenues, a Gannett specialty, declined by 8 per cent,
to Dollars 47.8m. This reflected in part the sale of a business in Arizona.
On Wall Street, the share price of Gannett yesterday closed Dollars 1 3/8
lower at Dollars 53 3/8 .
City Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial
institution, lifted first-quarter results to 858m new pesos (Dollars 277m),
a 24 per cent increase on the same period in 1992, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.

ALCAN Aluminium, which suffered a 6 per cent decline in first-quarter sales
to USDollars 1.73bn due to depressed fabricated metal prices, reported a net
loss of Dollars 20m, or 11 cents a share, for the term, compared with a loss
of Dollars 15m, or 9 cents, a year ago.
The recession in Japan also affected Alcan's results. Its share of
equity-accounted companies, including Nippon Light Metal, the Japanese
associate, resulted in a Dollars 2m loss against a Dollars 22m profit.
In Canada, where Alcan produces most of its ingot, losses were substantially
lower. US operations, which include primary, fabricated and rolled products,
showed a small loss against a slight profit. However, Brazil improved.
The European units weakened, especially in Italy and France, because of the
recession. Shipments of fabricated products were down 3 per cent and average
realised prices slipped 12 per cent. Ingot shipments were lower but average
prices received gained a little.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said aluminium was likely to remain over-supplied
in the near term, with depressed prices. Cost reduction and productivity
gains remained the top priority.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Bronfman groups simplify their
financial web
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL senior holding companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family
have announced a restructuring of their financial arrangements with one
another.
The changes, the start of an effort to simplify the web of interlocking
private and public companies, will relieve Edper Enterprises and Hees
International Bancorp of contingent obligations relating to Brascan
Holdings. Brascan is a private company which holds 49 per cent of Brascan
Ltd, a publicly-listed Bronfman holding company.
The changes are complex, reflecting the intricate cross-holdings and
financing arrangements within the Bronfman empire. As a first step, Edper
will contribute CDollars 279m (USDollars 221.40m) of junior preferred shares
to Brascan Holdings. Edper will also have the right over five years to
require Hees to buy its common share holdings in Brascan for Hees common
shares or an equivalent security.
Hees, which owns CDollars 765m of Brascan senior preferred shares, will be
released from an obligation to buy Brascan preferred shares to fund future
purchases of Brascan equity securities. Hees will also be assured of a more
stable earnings and dividend flow from its investment in Brascan.
The complex structure of the Bronfman empire has made it difficult for
outsiders to judge the extent of recent financial pressures on the group.
But the group has this year disposed of some of its most prized assets,
including controlling stakes in John Labatt, the brewer and entertainment
group, and MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry company.
As a result of the latest changes, Edper has reduced the carrying value of
its 50.1 per cent stake in Brascan. The CDollars 140m charge pushed Edper to
a CDollars 298.6m loss in 1992, compared with net earnings of CDollars 19.4m
the previous year.
On completion of the transaction, expected in early May, Hees will record a
corresponding gain.

UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, announced a reshuffling of its top
management yesterday following the unexpected deterioration in the health of
its chief executive, Mr Theodore Cooper.
The company named Mr Ley Smith as president and chief operating officer with
the responsibilities of the chief executive in Mr Cooper's absence. Mr Smith
was previously vice-chairman.
Mr William Parfet, the son of Mr Cooper's predecessor, was named
vice-chairman. He was previously president of the company.
Mr Cooper, 64, discovered he had bone marrow cancer in January. The cancer
was diagnosed at an early stage and Upjohn had hoped it would not affect Mr
Cooper's ability to lead the company.
Upjohn's board held a special meeting yesterday after Mr Cooper was moved
into intensive care as a result of a lung infection and respiratory failure.
His condition was described as critical but stable.
Mr Cooper joined Upjohn in 1980 and succeeded Mr Ray Parfet as chairman in
1987.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: General Electric climbs 10% in
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US has reported a 10 per cent increase in
first-quarter profits to Dollars 1.16bn after tax, helped by strong earnings
advances in most divisions other than aircraft engines and technical
products and services.
The improvement translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.36, up by 11
per cent on Dollars 1.23 reported for the first quarter of 1992. If the
discontinued aerospace operations are excluded from the comparisons,
after-tax profits from continuing businesses would have risen by 13 per
cent, to Dollars 1.08bn.
First-quarter revenues from the continuing interests increased by 3 per
cent, to Dollars 12.9bn, year-on-year.
Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, said the earnings growth was 'broad-based as
double-digit increases were reported by GE Capital Services, transportation
systems, motors, NBC, power systems, appliances and plastics'. The lower
profits in the aircraft engines division, which produces Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines, 'reflected an increase in product development costs and
restructuring costs necessary to meet market conditions', he said.
Mr Welch also suggested that the first-quarter results 'positioned the
company for another strong year of earnings growth'.
Within its various operating divisions, GE said that GE Capital Services had
seen net earnings advance by 22 per cent, with the sharpest advances coming
in its speciality insurance and speciality financing units.
Mr Michael Goldstein, vice-chairman of Toys R Us, said he was pleased with
business so far this year.
He said sales had been particularly strong in computer games, although bad
weather had hurt sales of warm-weather products.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Japanese 'mini-bubble' set to
catch a train - A rail group is about to test the strength of Tokyo's
rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rebound of the Tokyo stock market, already termed by some investors as
the 'mini bubble', spells relief for the Japanese government, forced over
the past two years to postpone floating off its holdings in Japanese
companies by falling share prices.
This week, the government is due to decide to go ahead with the listing of
East Japan Railway (JR East), one of the seven regional companies created in
1987 by the break-up of Japan National Railways (JNR), the national railway
operator.
JNR was split up in order to tackle its mounting losses resulting from
inefficient operations and rising debt. A government-owned company, JNR
Settlement Corp, was set up to hold the shares in the resulting six
passenger companies and one freight company, thereby removing them from
direct government control, but not government ownership.
JR East is ready to file a preliminary application to the Tokyo stock
exchange for a listing in October. Half of the company's 4m shares are
expected to be offered in the first tranche, with 500,000 shares to be
auctioned.
JNR Settlement needs to sell the shares to raise funds to reduce JR East's
mounting debt. Initially, the holding company had planned to reduce the debt
by selling railway property.
However, the government introduced restrictions on land sales in the 1980s
after a sharp rise of Japanese property prices prompted fears that railway
company land sales would fuel the surge in property prices.
Meanwhile, Japanese stockbrokers are eager to promote JR East shares, hoping
that low-priced stock will bring retail investors back to the market.
A recent survey by Okasan Economic Research Institute, the research arm of
Okasan Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, showed that 66 per cent of
1,200 investors surveyed were interested in buying JR East shares.
At the same time, an 82 per cent surge so far this year in the share price
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), the privatised telecommunications
group in which the government still holds a 65.7 per cent stake, has helped
lift retail investor confidence.
The earlier plunge in NTT shares, the most widely held stock in Japan,
disillusioned individual investors and sparked distrust in the government
which sold the NTT shares at a high price.
Last August, the NTT stock had fallen 80 per cent from its peak, prompting
the government to postpone offering additional tranches in NTT shares as
well as the listing of JR East. Although some investors are still cautious,
the recovery in NTT shares has set the stage for the JR East listing.
Japanese brokers have already embraced the flotation and are promoting
companies related to the JR group, such as rolling stock manufacturers and
railway construction companies as a new 'theme' for the stock market.
According to the Okasan survey, investors said they were willing to buy the
shares if they were priced at about Y200,000 each.
A figure now mooted in the Japanese press is Y250,000, which, if JR East
decides to maintain its previous year's dividend of Y5,000 a share, would
mean the stock would yield 2 per cent. 'As a stock it's good value,' says Mr
Graeme McDonald, analyst at James Capel in Tokyo.
However, the company is unlikely to grow quickly, and is expected to be
burdened by heavy capital expenditure for the 1998 Olympics in Nagano. The
company reported a 0.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y109bn (Dollars
956.14m) for its last financial year and estimates pre-tax profits will fall
7.1 per cent for the current year to March 1994.
Moreover, unlike other private railway companies that have diversified into
land development and retail businesses, JR East has only its railways
operations to rely on. Ms Kumiko Takase, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
in Tokyo, says: 'JR has nothing to fall back on when the railway business
does badly.'
The Tokyo stock market has rebounded on government support measures, the
recovery in NTT's share price, an increase in liquidity due to low interest
rates, and the release of positive economic news.
Since the outcome of JR East's listing will decide the fate of other
semi-privatised corporations - such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining
Japanese railway companies - government officials are keeping their fingers
crossed that the 'mini bubble' does not burst before October.

<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the world's largest rubbish hauler, said that it expected
to report flat earnings in the first quarter.
The Illinois-based company's stock tumbled to a 52-week low this week as
investors became disillusioned with the company's growth potential.
Waste Management issued the earnings estimates in response to adverse Wall
Street projections earlier this week. It will release official results next
week.
In spite of adding more than 400 salespeople in North America last year,
Waste Management forecast first-quarter earnings of 40 to 41 cents per
share.
This was little changed from last year's first-quarter result of 39 cents
per share.
The group's publicly-traded subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, is also
expecting flat results for the first quarter, at Dollars 29m, or 15 cents
per share.
Waste Management's Wheelabrator Technologies subsidiary is expected to earn
between 17 and 18 cents per share in the quarter, down sharply from last
year's 29 cents per share.
Earnings at Waste Management International, the group's UK subsidiary, were
projected at between 13 and 15 cents per American depositary share.
The company said that first-quarter results for its newly-formed Rust
International subsidiary were expected to meet internal expectations, but
the company did not provide details.
Waste Management, which had been expected to benefit from the new American
administration's interest in the environment, plans to change its name to
WMX Technologies at its annual meeting on May 14.

<TEXT>
SALOMON, the US securities house, has had about Dollars 8bn of outstanding
debt downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. The
downgrade, which could push up the cost of Salomon's borrowings, reflected
the firm's reliance on proprietary trading activity 'which has increased its
vulnerability to quarterly earnings volatility,' S&amp;P said.
Salomon's longer-term senior debt rating was cut to single A minus from
single A. Its subordinated debt rating fell to triple B plus from single A
minus. Preferred stock received a rating of triple B from triple B plus, and
the commercial paper rating was cut to A-2 from A-1.
Mr Donald Howard, chief financial officer said: 'Some rating agencies focus
too heavily on the short-term volatility of Salomon's earnings and give
inadequate weight to our results measured over longer time-frames and to the
exceptional quality and liquidity of our assets.'

QATAR'S Doha Bank, which lost Dollars 28.6m in 1991 mainly because of a
deposit with the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI),
said it returned to profit in 1992, Reuter reports from Manama.
Doha Bank, which is owned by Qatari shareholders, announced a QR38m (Dollars
10.5m) net profit for last year. It made a Dollars 65m deposit with BCCI in
1991 but expected to get back only 40 per cent of the sum.
The bank, with branches in Pakistan and New York, plans to raise its paid-up
capital by 50 per cent to QR78.5m by issuing shares worth QR26.25m. It said
it had won approval from the Qatari authorities to increase its capital, and
the issue would be put before a shareholders' meeting next week. New shares
would be offered to shareholders at a face value of QR100.
Assets rose to QR2.73bn in 1992 from QR2.64bn the previous year.
Shareholders' equity rose to QR200m from QR172m. Earnings per share stood at
QR72.42 in 1992. The bank has an 11.11 per cent capital adequacy ratio,
higher than the 8 per cent required by the Bank of International
Settlements.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco modifies scheme to
create two types of share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the large food and cigarettes manufacturer, is to proceed with
its 'targeted stock' scheme - which will create two classes of shares, one
pegged to the fortunes of its tobacco division and one to the performance of
its food operations - in spite of the cigarette price war begun by Philip
Morris, a rival manufacturer, earlier this month.
RJR Nabisco says its scheme will be modified in two important respects.
First, the group will simply proceed with the sale of 93m RN-Nabisco shares
to new investors. These shares will be pegged to the food operations'
performance and represent a 25 per cent interest in the food group's equity.
RJR Nabisco will not issue RN-Nabisco shares to existing investors in the
company at this stage. Instead, the existing RJR Nabisco shares will be
renamed as RN-Reynolds shares once the RN-Nabisco flotation has gone ahead,
and Reynolds group will retain the remaining 75 per cent interest in the
food group's equity.
This contrasts with the original targeted stock scheme, which envisaged that
another 142m RN-Nabisco shares would be issued to existing RJR Nabisco
shareholders about six months after the flotation of RN-Nabisco shares.
Secondly, the company will delay declaring any dividends on the renamed
RN-Reynolds shares until 'there is a clear assessment of the domestic
tobacco operating environment and the company can initiate a dividend policy
that is consistent with its capital structure and credit rating targets'.
This group of shares will carry a 'pass-through' dividend of about three
cents a share from the third quarter of 1993 onwards, reflecting this
stock's retained interest in the dividend-paying food interests.
The scheme retains the all-important fund-raising elements of the original
package. The flotation of the RN-Nabisco shares is scheduled to raise about
Dollars 1.5bn - a valuable contribution to RJR Nabisco's ongoing effort to
pay down the heavy debts dating back to the Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of

MARRIOTT and Hilton Hotels, two of the largest quoted US hotel groups,
unveiled first-quarter results yesterday which reflected mixed experiences
in the lodging market.
Marriott's lodging operations saw a 17 per cent rise in operating profits in
the quarter, although revenues were up by only 3 per cent.
In the full-service hotel sector, the group saw a gain of 3 percentage
points in occupancy levels, while room-rates were generally static.
But, in the mid-price and economy segment, Marriott reported higher
room-rates. Occupancy at the Courtyard and Residence Inn chains improved,
while Fairfield Inn, the economy chain, saw a one percentage point drop in
occupancy levels.
The profits advances in the lodging division helped Marriott to a net profit
before accounting-related changes of Dollars 19m, up from Dollars 11m last
time. Sales were Dollars 2.08bn compared with Dollars 1.95bn. Contract
services, the group's other large division, saw a 25 per cent gain in
operating profits.
Hilton said its hotels division saw a 3 per cent decline in operating
profits in the first quarter. Occupancy rose by 4 percentage points, but
room rates remained flat and dipped in some important markets.
In Hilton's gaming division, business was more encouraging, leading to an 18
per cent advance in operating profits. That left the group overall posting a
4 per cent increase in after-tax profits, at Dollars 23.1m, before
accounting-related changes. Total revenues were up by one-fifth at Dollars
331.6m.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday posted
first-quarter net income of Dollars 401.5m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, on
sales of Dollars 2.11bn.
A year earlier, the company's results were muddied by a number of special
items which cumulatively added Dollars 90.1m to earnings and brought net
income to Dollars 453.4m, or Dollars 1.43, on sales of Dollars 2bn.
Stripping out a one-time items in 1992, American Home Products's net income
advanced 11 per cent in the latest quarter.
The company's pharmaceuticals business saw the biggest sales gain in the
quarter, rising 8 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn on the back of strong sales of
anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs for women.
In consumer healthcare, sales rose 2 per cent to Dollars 448.5m, reflecting
a less severe cold and 'flu season. Food products sales were flat.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, announced another strong set of
quarterly earnings yesterday, although increased taxes left net income for
the first three months of the year lower than a year ago at Dollars 70.9m
against Dollars 74.3m.
The higher tax rate aside, PaineWebber reported record net revenues of
Dollars 696.8m, up 6 per cent on 1992 and the highest in the firm's 114-year
history. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.26, fully diluted, were also a
record.
The PaineWebber results ensure that the securities industry, buoyed by large
interest in equities from individual investors and heavy demand for
underwriting services from corporations, is on course for its third
consecutive year of record earnings.
Analysts estimated that Wall Street firms would earn more than Dollars 2bn
between them in the first quarter alone.
Revenues from all of PaineWebber's main business segments were higher than a
year ago, mirroring the performance of Merrill Lynch, another big Wall
Street securities house, which reported record profits on Tuesday.
Earnings from brokerage commissions rose 5 per cent to Dollars 242m, while
revenues from principal transactions and investment banking rose slightly,
to Dollars 203.7m and Dollars 100.6m, respectively.
The fastest-growing business, was asset management, where earnings jumped 17
per cent in the quarter to Dollars 73.3m as mutual fund assets rose 24 per
cent and total assets under management climbed to about Dollars 37.5bn.
Interest revenues advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 289.5m.
Within the different business segments, Mr Donald Marron, PaineWebber's
chairman, singled out the performance of the institutional sales and trading
business, which reported 13 per cent growth in revenues, led by
client-driven fixed income and equity sales.
Retail sales and marketing, part of the firm's traditional securities
brokerage business, also fared especially well, said Mr Marron.
About 250 new brokers were added to the workforce during the quarter, taking
the total to 5,150.
PaineWebber's expenses climbed almost 7 per cent to Dollars 580.5m in the
quarter, mostly because of higher performance-related employee compensation.
The company's shares rose Dollars  1/2 in early trading on Wall Street, the
highest level the stock has been in the past year, but closed unchanged on
the day at Dollars 27 1/4.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco deep in red as
provisions almost treble
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Trustco, the crippled financial services group controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, has disclosed the severity of the financial problems which
led to the pending takeover of its operations by Royal Bank of Canada.
The group yesterday reported a record net loss in 1992 of CDollars 852m
(USDollars 676.1m), or CDollars 5.93 a share, compared with earnings in 1991
of CDollars 107m, or 25 cents a share.
Loan-loss provisions almost trebled to CDollars 421m from CDollars 155m.
Much of the increase was blamed on a significant deterioration in its
commercial real estate portfolio in the fourth quarter, especially in
Canada.
The company also took a CDollars 93m write-down of goodwill in the fourth
quarter, while assets fell to CDollars 25.1bn from CDollars 37.5bn.
Royal Trustco was for years one of Canada's most venerable financial
institutions, specialising in home mortgages and fiduciary services. But
ill-advised forays into Europe and the US, compounded by the North American
recession, resulted in heavy losses in recent years.
Trilon Financial, a Bronfman holding company, earlier this year began
seeking an outside investor to inject equity into Royal Trustco. Trilon
Financial last month agreed to sell all Royal Trustco's operations to Royal
Bank of Canada for CDollars 1.65bn.
Royal Trustco will be left as little more than a shell to recoup what it can
from a loan portfolio of CDollars 4.5bn.
The company expects the deal with Royal Bank to close either in the late
summer or autumn.
Several outside shareholders have accused Royal Trustco's management of not
providing timely disclosure of the company's financial problems.
Royal Trustco's share price has plummeted from CDollars 18.25 in 1990 to 40
cents yesterday, down 7 cents on the day.

<TEXT>
SHARES in B. F. Goodrich, the US plastics group and specialty chemicals
group, dropped after the company posted first-quarter financial results that
were much lower than expected, Reuter reports.
The Ohio-based company lost Dollars 7.6m, or 38 cents a share, in the first
quarter, while analysts had expected a profit of about 1 cent a share. For
the same period last year, the company made a loss of Dollars 1.9m, or 16
cents a share, before accounting adjustment.
On Wall Street, Goodrich shares closed Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 46 7/8
.
Goodrich said its aerospace businesses continued to meet expectations during
the quarter and that many of its speciality chemicals businesses performed
well in the quarter.
'But results for the segment overall continue to be hurt by weak demand in
construction-related markets and by generally poor economic conditions in
Canada and Europe,' said Mr John Ong, chairman.
Goodrich has said that it planned to spin off its Geon Viny division as a
wholly-owned subsidiary, offering about 50 per cent of the new company's
stock to the public.

BANK of New York, which last year agreed to buy 62 branches from the US
subsidiary of Barclays Bank, yesterday unveiled a healthy 56 per cent jump
in its first-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 125m.
The first-quarter profit translates into fully-diluted earnings per share of
Dollars 1.37, up from 97 cents in the same quarter of 1992.
The result was achieved on the back of wider interest margins, higher fee
income, lower non-performing assets and better earnings resulting from a
continuing shift in the bank's mix of assets.
The bank, with total assets of Dollars 40bn, said fee income rose by 14 per
cent year-on-year, to Dollars 108m, thanks largely to credit card
processing.
Total non-performing assets dropped by 33 per cent, to Dollars 860m, while
bad debt provisions in the quarter declined to Dollars 100m from Dollars
157m in the first quarter of 1992.
Net interest income was Dollars 334m in the quarter, compared with Dollars
308m a year before. Non-interest income increased by 11 per cent to Dollars
320m in the quarter.
The adoption of new accounting standards resulted in a Dollars 46m charge to
retained earnings for prior periods, but the bank said the charge would have
no future impact. Its return on assets in the quarter was 1.2 per cent, up
from 0.77 per cent.
On Wall Street, the Bank of New York's shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 60 1/2 .
Wachovia, the North Carolina-based bank, reported that its first-quarter net
income rose by 14.6 per cent to Dollars 121.6m, or 69 cents a share.
First of America Bank realised first-quarter securities gains of Dollars
7.2m, pushing earnings for the period to Dollars 58.6m, or 98 cents, Reuter
reports. It earned Dollars 26m, or 41 cents, in the first quarter of 1992.

MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, yesterday beat
analysts' expectations by unveiling a 35.8 per cent jump in third-quarter
net income to Dollars 243m, or 80 cents a share, helped by the continuing
popularity of its Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS operating systems.
A year earlier, Microsoft earned Dollars 179m, or 69 cents. Revenues in the
three months to March 31 soared nearly 41 per cent to Dollars 958m from
Dollars 681m.
On Wall Street, Microsoft shares added to Dollars 89. The results were
released after the close of trading. Most analysts had expected earnings of
about 78 cents a share.
For the first nine months of the company's 1993 fiscal year, Microsoft
earned Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28a share, up 38.1 per cent from Dollars
498m, or Dollars 1.70, the previous year. Revenues grew 39.7 per cent to
Dollars 2.71bn from Dollars 1.94bn.
Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said: 'We have expanded core
businesses, introduced new product lines and maintained our emphasis on
operating efficiencies.'
Microsoft has licensed more than 25m copies of its Windows operating system
since its debut in 1990. The company said Windows is now pre-installed in
about 60 per cent of personal computers.
Earlier this week, Microsoft announced an agreement to work with Compaq
Computer to make personal computers easier to use and to develop new
products and markets.
The company is expected to launch its Windows NT (New Technology) in May.

CITY Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial
institution, lifted its results to 858m new pesos (Dollars 277m) for the
first quarter, a 24 per cent increase on the first quarter of 1992.
The results include a 183m peso revaluation of subsidiary assets. Excluding
the revaluation, profits were 675m pesos, a 12.5 per cent increase on 1992.
Banamex, the recently-privatised bank and the group's largest subsidiary,
contributed 570m pesos to profits, a 14 per cent increase on the first
quarter last year. Mexican banks, unlike other Mexican companies, do not
adjust results for inflation, which in March was 10.4 per cent on an annual
rate.
Mr Jorge Hierro, director of investor relations at Banamex, attributed the
profits increase to the growth in the bank's loan portfolio of 29 per cent
and in retail loans of 62 per cent. In addition, it improved margins and
benefited from cost controls.
Accival, the group's brokerage, had profits of 41m pesos, a 19.5 per cent
return on equity, against the bank's return on equity of 26.8 per cent.

MARRIOTT and Hilton Hotels, two of the largest quoted hotels groups in the
US, unveiled first-quarter results yesterday which reflected mixed
experiences in the lodging market.
Marriott's lodging operations saw a 17 per cent increase in operating
profits during the three-month period, although revenues were up by only 3
per cent.
In the full-service hotel sector, the group saw a gain of 3 percentage
points in occupancy levels, while room-rates were generally static.
However, in the mid-price and economy segment Marriott reported higher
room-rates. Occupancy levels at the Courtyard and Residence Inn chains
improved while the Fairfield Inn, the economy chain, saw a one percentage
point drop in occupancy levels, to about 75 per cent.
The profits advances in the lodging division helped Marriott to a net profit
before accounting-related changes of Dollars 19m, up from Dollars 11m last
time.
Total sales were Dollars 2.08bn compared with Dollars 1.95bn. Contract
services, the group's other large division, saw a 25 per cent gain in
operating profits and an 11 per cent sales advance.
Marriott is attempting to demerge its financially-healthy lodging and
contract services operations into a separately-quoted company, leaving
behind its property assets and the bulk of the group's heavy debts.
It said the plan, opposed by some bondholders, would be voted on by
shareholders at the 1993 annual meeting on June 22.
'Despite the mixed signals in the economic environment, we are optimistic
about the rest of the year,' said Mr J. W. Marriott, chairman.
Hilton said its hotels division saw a 3 per cent decline in operating
profits in the first quarter. Occupancy rose by 4 percentage points, but
room rates remained flat, and dipped in some important markets.
In Hilton's gaming division, business was more encouraging, leading to an 18
per cent advance in operating profits. That left the group overall posting a
4 per cent increase in after-tax profits, at Dollars 23.1m, before
accounting-related changes. Total revenues were up by one-fifth at Dollars
331.6m.

<TEXT>
BANQUES Populaires, the French banking group, yesterday added to the gloomy
mood of France's financial sector by announcing a 21 per cent fall in net
profits to FFr1.28bn (Dollars 239m) in 1992 from FFr1.64bn the previous
year.
The decline at Banques Populaires is the latest in a stream of bad news to
have come from French banks. They have been hit by a downturn in demand for
credit and by the need to make steep provisions on their property portfolios
and industrial investments.
Societe Generale, one of the largest private-sector banks, last week
announced static net profits of FFr3.3bn for 1992. This followed a 26 per
cent decline in net profits for Banque Nationale de Paris, the
state-controlled bank which is a prime candidate for privatisation, to
FFr2.2bn and of a FFr1.85bn loss for Credit Lyonnais, also scheduled for
sale.
Banques Populaires, which operates a number of regional commercial banking
networks across France, has been affected by the impact of the economic
slowdown on the industry.
Despite the competitive credit market, the bank managed to raise net banking
income by 8 per cent to FFr17.7bn in 1992 from FFr16.5bn in 1991. It also
increased operating profits by 26 per cent to FFr4.6bn from FFr3.6bn over
the same period.
However, the group was forced to make a steep increase in provisions on sour
loans and dubious investments.

<TEXT>
AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, has fixed the issue price of its
previously-announced one-for-10 rights issue at Fl 89 per share. The
proceeds of slightly more than Fl 450m (Dollars 253.6m) will be used to
strengthen shareholders' equity after a string of acquisitions in 1991 and
1992.
The rights issue, announced last month when the company unveiled its 1992
results, had come as a surprise because Ahold had not been expected to issue
new shares until it made its next big acquisition.
Ahold's shares closed down Fl 0.80 at Fl 96 in Amsterdam yesterday.
Trading in the rights to the 5.1m new common shares is due to start on April
19 and end on April 29, with payment on May 13. The rights issue has been
underwritten by a banking syndicate led by ABN Amro of the Netherlands.

OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, is planning a FM500m
(Dollars 88.69m) rights issue this year to strengthen its balance sheet and
help finance its investment programme.
The Finnish state has already indicated that it would support the issue in
line with its 57.5 per cent direct stake in the company.
The timing of the move has yet to be decided, but could come as early as the
late spring to exploit improved stock market conditions in Finland following
the sharp depreciation of the markka and the fall in domestic interest
rates. The issue will carry preferential subscription rights for current
shareholders.
Mr Pentti Hakkarainen, a vice-president, said proceeds from the issue would
help the group move closer to its target of a 30 per cent equity/total asset
ratio from its current level of around 17 per cent.
It would also enable the company to maintain its annual capital expenditure
at the FM1.3bn to FM1.5bn level, he stated.
Outokumpu has been encouraged to proceed with the plan by its own improving
financial performance, with losses before extraordinary items narrowing last
year to FM360m from FM768m in 1991. A further improvement in its result is
expected this year.
Outokumpu was one of five Finnish state-owned groups earmarked for possible
privatisation last November. The government said it was looking to expand
the ownership base of the companies and to ensure they had adequate
financial resources for their development.

lawsuit

<TEXT>
A GROUP of investors who hold bonds issued in 1988 by Daf, the liquidated
Dutch truckmaker that has recently been re-established as Daf Trucks, said
yesterday they plan to sue the issue's lead-manager, ABN Amro Bank, as well
as its trustee, Nederlandsche Trust Maatschappij.
Mr Gary Klesch, chairman of London-based Klesch &amp; Co, said that ABN Amro's
1988 prospectus had been 'misleading,' while the trustee company had
neglected to protect bondholders' rights when Daf was restructured in 1992.
A spokesman for ABN Amro said the bank was aware of Mr Klesch's charges but
rejected them.
The investors, who belong to the newly-formed Association for the Promotion
of the Interests of Daf NV Bondholders, will be seeking damages of Fl 150m
(Dollars 83m), which is equivalent to the total value of the 1988 issue of 6
3/4 per cent bonds.
The bonds have a nominal value of Fl 1,000 but are trading at just Fl 7
following the collapse of the original Daf company and the formation of its
successor. Mr Klesch said that, so far, the association represented
investors holding Daf bonds worth Fl 30m and that discussions were taking
place with other bondholders.
At issue is the prospectus's wording on the subject of equal treatment of
current and future creditors. Mr Klesch said holders of the bond issued by
Daf NV, a holding company, were given to understand that they would be
accorded equal treatment if the company provided security to any future
lenders. In the 1992 restructuring, security was furnished to Daf's bankers
by the company's operating subsidiaries, not the holding company itself, he
said.

spending

<TEXT>
X:DEUTSCHE Aerospace, the aircraft and space technology division of
Daimler-Benz, suffered a 17 per cent drop in new orders last year as civil
and military spending cuts took effect.
The company, which lost a net DM341m (Dollars 216m) on sales of DM17.3bn in
1992, was still on course to return to profit by 1995, Mr Jurgen Schrempp,
chairman, said yesterday.
However, planning would be eased and potential capacity problems could be
avoided if the Bonn government made clear decisions now on its future
strategy. Further cancellations of public contracts threatened the whole
defence industry, he warned.
Total new orders fell to DM12.5bn last year from DM15bn. Defence contracts
fell more than expected to DM2.4bn from DM2.7bn.
The company, which made a net profit of DM50m in 1991, would have been in
the black last year had it not been obliged to take extraordinary charges
for personnel and strategic measures, the company said.
Only two of its six divisions - space systems and aircraft, which includes
Deutsche Airbus - made an operating profit last year. Defence and civil
systems alone lost DM264m.
Dasa, a core business within Daimler-Benz, which recently forecast a further
fall in group earnings of up to 30 per cent this year, expects sales for the
year to be little changed from last year's DM17.3bn.
It has been hard hit by the combination of recession and the slump in
defence markets since the ending of the cold war, and first warned several
months ago that it faced the most difficult two years in its history.
Meanwhile, the management has pressed ahead with plans to develop its
interests in civil aircraft.

flotation

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Equity, formerly part of Mr John Spalvins failed Adelaide
Steamship group, yesterday announced a second attempt to float its
Woolworths supermarket chain on the Australian stock exchange.
Woolworths is expected to raise up to ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.43m) if the
offer goes ahead, which would make it Australia's biggest flotation.
IEL abandoned its first attempt in the face of market jitters last year.
IEL said the flotation would proceed unless there was 'a serious
deterioration in the market which significantly reduces the price obtainable
for Woolworths relative to its earnings and value'.
The Australian market has rallied since the last attempted flotation was
abandoned in September. The ASX All Ordinaries index closed at a three-year
high of 1704.4 after the announcement.
IEL said the prospectus would be ready by June, but the exact timing would
depend on market conditions.
It said the offer would be made via a book building process under which
institutional investors would be invited to apply for shares within a
nominated price range. The offer will not be underwritten.
Woolworths, which made an operating profit of ADollars 247m last year, is
the biggest asset remaining in the Adsteam group, which has been controlled
by its bankers since Mr Spalvins was fired by the board two years ago.
IEL is jointly owned by Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, the
group's three main companies. IEL has already spun off its National Foods
subsidiary as part of the financial restructuring of Adsteam, which has
debts of about ADollars 6bn.
IEL reported an improvement in net profit to ADollars 79m last year from
ADollars 27m in the previous year, compared with substantial losses incurred
by its parent companies. It said the improvement would have been larger but
for the ADollars 19m cost of deferring the flotation of Woolworths.
The Woolworths flotation is expected to be followed over the next 12 months
by the privatisation of the government's remaining 75 per cent stake in
Qantas, the sale of a further 19 per cent of the government-controlled
Commonwealth Bank, and the flotation of the Channel Seven television
network.

FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Lyonnaise annual profits tumble
67.5% to FFr379m

LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, one of France's largest industrial groups,
yesterday announced a sharp fall in net profits of 67.5 per cent to just
FFr379m (Dollars 71m) last year from FFr1.17bn in 1991. The company also
said it was considering the flotation of Dumez, its troubled construction
subsidiary.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, described 1992 as an 'unfavourable' year for the
group's public sector building interests, 'dreadful' for property, and
'good' for its service sector activities, which include water and energy.
'We will do everything we can to ensure that 1993 will be better than 1992,'
he said, 'but the economic environment is so uncertain that no company
chairman can be very accurate in their forecasts.'
Mr Monod announced the appointment of Mr Guy de Panafieu as deputy chairman
and head of its construction and property interests, leaving him well-placed
to take over as chairman. Mr de Panafieu, 50, succeeds Mr Jean-Paul Payrare,
former head of Dumez, who left last summer, apparently after a row with Mr
Monod.
Dumez was one of Lyonnaise's main problems last year. The company has been
badly affected by the downturn in the European construction sector. Mr Monod
said he hoped to recapitalise Dumez before the end of this year and may
eventually float it on the stock market.
Lyonnaise is also considering plans to float M6, its television station. In
the meantime, it intends to raise around FFr2bn in cash this year by selling
peripheral interests, including its minority stake in Havas, the French
media group, and its German radio interests.
The group managed to increase overall sales to FFr90.4bn in 1992 from
FFr87.5bn in 1991. It also mustered a slight increase in operating profits
to FFr2.69bn from FFr2.59bn. However, it was hit by an exceptional loss of
FFr198m, against a FFr428m credit. It was also forced to raise provisions to
FFr13bn from FFr10.5bn.
Lyonnaise, which has held its 1992 dividend at FFr10, saw sales increase in
its service interests to FFr32.9bn in 1992 from FFr28.9bn in 1991, although
profits slipped to FFr1.65bn from FFr1.78bn.
By contrast, the construction division posted static sales of FFr45.9bn and
made a loss of FFr461m. The worst area was property, where sales fell to
FFr11.6bn from FFr13.5bn.

CIBA, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals and chemicals group, has reported a 4 per
cent slide in consolidated sales in the first quarter to SFr5.69bn (Dollars
3.93bn).
Sales in the healthcare sector grew 5 per cent to SFr2.07bn, but this was
not enough to offset continuing weakness in the agricultural and industrial
chemical sectors.
Sales of plant protection products, for example, were down 15 per cent to
SFr1.2bn and sales of textile dyes dropped 6 per cent to SFr359m.
Sales in the agricultural sector as a whole were down 13 per cent to
SFr1.4bn, partly due to seasonal factors, but Ciba said there was a
perceptible rise towards the end of the quarter.
The growth of sales in the healthcare sector was substantially lower than
the levels achieved a year ago. Ciba said it was not possible to repeat the
extraordinarily high introductory sales of Habitrol, its nicotine patch to
help people stop smoking, achieved during the first quarter of 1992.
The group said it still looked for a modest increase in sales in the year as
a whole.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tinplate takes the pressure - An important
division for British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE year since Mr Don Turner switched from running British Steel's narrow
strip business to become managing director of the South Wales-based tinplate
division, he has been putting his new colleagues' welcoming remarks to the
test.
'When I came here they said this isn't a cyclical business,' he says. If
anything it was viewed as anticyclical - because people are supposed to eat
more canned food in a recession.
That has not been demonstrated totally in the current recession, he says,
but the cycle is much less pronounced than in the general steel industry.
'It's nothing like what you find in steel markets such as construction and
automobile manufacture,' says Mr John May, marketing manager.
The relative stability of the tinplate business is important for British
Steel, whose other products have taken the full blast of the downturn.
Tinplate - which is 99.75 per cent steel - accounts for about 10 per cent of
the company's finished products and at about Pounds 500 a tonne generates
annual revenues of some Pounds 400m.
Overall, the European can market is showing 'static to slow growth,' says Mr
May - not exciting, perhaps, but a contrast to some general steel markets
which are in structural decline.
In some ways, though, the tinplate business has problems similar to those of
general steel. 'Prices are not what they should be, there is a continuing
cost/price squeeze and there is overcapacity,' says Mr Turner.
Demand in Europe is about 3.5m tonnes, compared with capacity of between
4.5m and 5m tonnes. Consequently, profitability is hardly sparkling, but is
better than average for a steel business. Actual profits are not disclosed.
And, just as in the general steel business, rationalisation within the
industry has left its mark on British Steel Tinplate. A workforce of 14,000
in the early 1970s - including basic steelmaking at the old Ebbw Vale works
in Gwent - fell to 5,000 three years ago.
Then, the Velindre works near Swansea was closed, and employment is now
about 3,200, most of whom are at the two remaining plants, Trostrey near
Llanelli and Ebbw Vale.
But there the similarity with the rest of British Steel ends. The tinplate
business is really part of the packaging industry, says Mr May, and over the
past decade has become much more European in outlook as the structure of its
customer industries has changed.
'There has been pressure on the tinplate industry to concentrate. That has
come from downstream where there has been great concentration in the
packaging industry - and this has happened among the retailers too.'
So the number of can-making customers is much smaller than the huge variety
of customers for general steel. Unfortunately, though, direct customers are
only part of the picture.
Tinplate is also involved in a very public and occasionally acrimonious
battle with the aluminium industry for the hearts and minds of the beverage
industry and its customers - which ultimately means the shopper.
The claims and counterclaims about the relative environmental friendliness,
recyclability, and aesthetic qualities of steel versus aluminium put the
marketing of tinplate on a different plane to that of, say, steel beams for
the construction industry.
The battle to persuade a brewer, for example, to switch from aluminium to
steel cans could start with Mr May's marketing team convincing a London
design house that the can design would work best in steel.
Over the past four years, British Steel Tinplate has spent Pounds 100m to
ensure it maintains its position against its big tinplate rivals and fight
the materials battle effectively. The investment culminates in July with the
opening of a new tinning line at Trostrey.
The company is one of four big tinplate producers in Europe, along with
Rasselstein - part of German group Thyssen - Hoogovens of the Netherlands
and Sollac, part of France's Usinor Sacilor.
Each hold a strong share of their home market, but are trying to boost sales
elsewhere. There are nine other producers, but these lack the full product
lines of the big four.
Most of the investment at British Steel Tinplate has gone towards
productivity improvements, maximising product quality and reducing cycle
times in the manufacture of thousands of tinplate grades.
The biggest single investment was a Pounds 50m continuous annealing plant,
commissioned in 1988. A Pounds 38m line has also been introduced, allowing
the company to offer tinplate strip up to 1200mm wide, initially for the
beverage industry.
Much smaller investments - although no less important in the long term  -
have been made in a Packaging Steels Development Centre at British Steel's
main Port Talbot site.
This is the focus of efforts to capitalise on what Mr Turner sees as steel's
USP (unique selling point) - its greater strength compared with aluminium,
allowing the development of steel cans with ever-thinner walls.
Developments such as the Ecotop, a dual button all-steel can end now being
test marketed in Europe, are particularly important in areas such as the UK
beverage sector, says Mr Turner.
Overall, 12bn steel cans are used in the UK every year, but only 3bn go to
beverage producers - and even those have aluminium tops.
While steel is dominant in food cans, aluminium leads the 7bn-can beverage
market. 'It is important to attack that market,' says Mr May.
The most important development could come next year when British Steel
unveils the all-steel Ultimate Can, made from a new steel allowing for a 30
per cent weight reduction on previous steel cans.
The can is being developed jointly by British Steel Tinplate, Hoogovens and
Rasselstein - a sign that the big groups are prepared to unite against a
common enemy.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels falls 35%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED administrative costs and interest charges resulted in a 35 per
cent downturn in annual profits at Friendly Hotels.
On turnover of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 28.7m), the pre-tax line for the 12
months to December 27 amounted to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.89m), struck after
administrative costs of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.7m) and interest payable of
Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.19m).
Nevertheless, Mr Henry Edwards, chairman of the hotel, catering and serviced
offices group, said the outcome was a 'creditable performance' given the
difficult trading conditions during the year.
He said, however, that trading had improved in the early part of the current
year. The level of advance bookings had shown an 'encouraging' increase
recently. The 17 serviced office complexes achieved 'satisfactory' profits
but margins remained under pressure.
A provision of Pounds 2.16m (Pounds 2.44m) was taken below the line in
respect of further disposals of quick service restaurants and Care Homes;
one of each remain to be sold and no further provisions are anticipated.
The recommended final dividend is raised to 3.5p bringing the total for the
year to 5.7p (5.5p), covered twice by fully diluted earnings of 11.4p
(15.5p) per share.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Yule Catto edges ahead to Pounds
22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YULE CATTO, the industrial chemicals and building products group, yesterday
reported a slight rise in 1992 profits and an improvement in earnings for
the 12th successive year.
The earnings record sets Yule Catto apart from most other chemical companies
which have not sufficiently controlled costs during the recession.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 22.2m on sales up 1 per
cent at Pounds 267.4m. Earnings per share rose from 16.1p to 16.4p and the
company is proposing a final dividend of 3.4p, giving a total of 5.9p - up
9.3 per cent.
Profits in the speciality chemicals division rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds
18.8m and were poised to benefit any cyclical upturn that emerges, according
to Mr Allister McLeish, finance director.
The company is likely to benefit from the decline of sterling and from a
strong position in Malaysia, further strengthened by two acquisitions.
Profits in the building materials side, however, fell 11.8 per cent to
Pounds 7.5m. Improvements in the UK companies were offset by weakness in the
Netherlands and France. Half of the divisions's sales are in the UK and half
in continental Europe. The company sells products specified by architects,
like office space glazing and roof lighting, and is not exposed to the
domestic house building market.
In spite of the weakening German market, Yule Catto's companies were doing
reasonably well and would continue to benefit from exposure in the eastern
part of the country.
Mr McLeish said the company would obviously benefit from any increase in
sales that might emerge from the improved sentiment. But it had succeeded in
maintaining earnings growth through the introduction of new products which
enjoyed higher margins.
Net debt over the year fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 10m, bringing
gearing down to 20 per cent and leaving interest more than 11 times covered.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alexandra in the black with Pounds 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDRA Workwear, a manufacturer and distributor of work clothes,
yesterday announced a return to profits for the year to January 30 1993,
reporting Pounds 1.7m before tax against losses of Pounds 500,000
previously.
The comparison is, however, distorted by a Pounds 1.5m exceptional provision
last time resulting from the closure of a factory in Scotland and associated
redundancies.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'The group's strategy for the year was to
significantly improve its balance sheet and restore profitability. We were
successful in both in the past year.'
Borrowings were reduced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 16m) cutting gearing from 73
to 46 per cent, and the company believes its debt will be halved by the next
year end. Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 1.7m.
The high level of stock was reduced to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 16.6m), with a
further Pounds 2m of cuts planned for the current year. Stock turnover was
about four months.
Mr Dennis said past investment in a computer meant the company would meet
customers orders should demand pick up suddenly.
One analyst said that 'the company outperformed during the 1980s but when
demand fell it didn't take control of its stock levels. This is evidence
that it is repairing that damage and that they are back on track.'
Turnover was virtually flat at Pounds 57m (Pounds 57.2m).
Mr Dennis said that during the first half it had sold 'selected' goods at
less-than-profitable prices to keep its factories occupied and prevent
redundancies.
This had reduced operating profits by about Pounds 900,000 and affected
gross margins, which fell to 42.4 per cent (43.9 per cent).
New 'stylishly personalised' merchandise had given the retail operations a
fillip.
Sales in France advanced 12 per cent and overseas sales were up 3.8 per cent
at Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.3m) in total.
A recommended final dividend of 2p gives a total for the year of 3.8p
(3.6p), payable from earnings per share of 3.5p against losses of 0.8p.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land has 25.1% of Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG LAND, the Jard-ine Matheson-controlled property company, has
tightened its grip over Trafalgar House by taking its stake in the UK-based
company above 25 per cent.
It negotiated the early exercise by the Swiss Bank Corporation of its put
option which may have required Hongkong Land taking its stake in Trafalgar
above 27 per cent.
Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land, said it had decided to 'end
the uncertainty in the market' by winding up the option rather than waiting
until it expired on May 3.
'We have now got to a level that we are happy with,' he added.
It is to acquire 23.5m ordinary and 28.74m A shares, bringing its total to
25.1 per cent of Trafalgar's capital.
Trafalgar's ordinary shares rose by  1/2 p to 79 1/2 p while the A shares
gained 2p to 79p.
Hongkong Land is expected to drift up, over several years, towards acquiring
its stated intention of 29.9 per cent by taking scrip dividends.
It is expected to press Trafalgar's board, when it meets on April 28, to
appoint its chairman, Mr Simon Keswick, as head of the UK construction,
engineering and property group.
Mr Alan Clements, Trafalgar's non-executive chairman, took over the position
last year as a temporary measure.
Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'Hongkong Land's
decision to negotiate an early end to the exercise creates useful headroom
towards reaching its medium term objective by taking scrip dividends instead
of cash.'
This is expected to help Trafalgar's cash flow and its utilisation of excess
advance corporation tax.
Hongkong Land has undertaken not to lift its stake above 29.9 per cent or
make a full bid until April 1 1994, unless a third party offer or tender is
made or a third party acquires 15 per cent.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered chairman's pay rises 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RODNEY Galpin, chairman of Standard Chartered, the international bank,
received a 29 per cent pay increase to Pounds 393,000 last year even though
the bank's pre-tax profits fell slightly.
Standard said the rise was justifiable because 'underlying' profits had
risen sharply - profits before bad debts rose 25 per cent to Pounds 436.5m.
However, the financial performance was hurt by a Pounds 366m charge for bad
and doubtful debts, including a Pounds 272m provision to cover possible
losses from Standard's involvement in an Indian stock market scandal.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 205.3m to Pounds 202m.
In its annual report Standard also disclosed that it had set up Standard
Chartered Holdings (International), a Dutch holding company that would hold
the majority of the group's overseas subsidiaries and associate
undertakings.
The bulk of Standard's operations are in the Far East and Africa.
The bank said the new corporate structure was intended to be more tax
efficient than existing arrangements, but did not disclose further details.
Mr Galpin is retiring at the annual meeting in May, to be replaced by Mr
Patrick Gillam, deputy chairman.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALKER GREENBANK, the restructured wallcoverings group, yesterday reported
higher full-year profits and bolstered its office seating and screening
fabrics business through the Pounds 1.6m acquisition of John Hartley
(Cowling).
The Hartley purchase, which included the assumption of Pounds 700,000 in
debt, was financed through a placing yesterday of 4.32m new shares at 70p a
share. The surplus Pounds 2.17m proceeds will be used to develop the Hartley
business and pay down the assumed debt. The shares closed unchanged at 75p
yesterday.
Greenbank, which has undergone a substantial reorganisation over the last
couple of years under a new management led by Mr Charles Wightman, chief
executive, yesterday reported a 4.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 5.43m to Pounds 5.65m in the year to January 31.
The pre-tax growth was held back by higher interest charges of Pounds
520,000 (Pounds 236,000). Earnings per share increased by 3.6 per cent to
4.29p (4.14p) and the final dividend is unchanged at 1.9p for a maintained
total of 3.1p.
Turnover declined marginally to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds 56.8m) reflecting the
sale of businesses, including loss-making Bloom Signs. Turnover from ongoing
businesses rose to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 47.9m) including a significant
increase in overseas sales to Pounds 12m (Pounds 8.5m).
Operating profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 6.23m (Pounds 5.88m) before
exceptional charges of Pounds 60,000 (Pounds 212,000) including
reorganisation and closure costs of Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 1.43m) and a
Pounds 489,000 property write-down offset by a Pounds 585,000 (Pounds 1.16m)
profit on the disposal of two properties. The property write-down followed a
January revaluation which also led to a Pounds 2.2m write-off against
revaluation reserves.
The results also included an extraordinary gain of Pounds 1.47m comprising
the Pounds 3.56m in net proceeds from out-of-court settlement of its dispute
arising from the 1987 acquisition of Alkar, partly offset by a Pounds 2.1m
loss on the disposal of businesses.
Group borrowings at the end of the year were marginally higher at Pounds
1.6m representing gearing of 6 per cent but have since been reduced to
'negligible levels.'
COMMENT
Greenbank's management team must hope that with the favourable settlement of
their Alkar litigation, the worst is behind them. The group is now focused
on its core commercial and consumer wallcoverings businesses, the balance
sheet is solid and acquisitions like Hartley look sensible. Raw material
costs are rising and will probably trim gross margins this year by about 1
per cent but this should be offset by growing exports, particularly to
continental Europe. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 7m this year
producing earnings of some 5p and a prospective p/e of 15. The shares have
risen sharply since September, but could still go higher.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thos Cook ends up with 21% of Owners -
Tender offer ties up loose ends in Pounds 285m travel industry bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, the travel agency and financial services company, has ended up
with a 21 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, the holiday group it helped
defend against a hostile bid from rival Airtours.
Owners' shareholders rushed to offer stock to satisfy the 150p a share
tender offer made by Thomas Cook at a crucial stage in the Pounds 285m
Airtours' bid.
When the offer closed on Tuesday, Thomas Cook had received tenders from
shareholders representing 76 per cent of Owners' shares.
In line with the terms, which limited Thomas Cook's offer to 12.5 per cent
of the equity, Owners shareholders have been scaled down to about 16 per
cent of what they tendered.
Thomas Cook and its sister company, LTU, the German tour company, will now
forge closer ties with Owners Abroad and will be anxious to see the savings
its new partner promised during the bid.
Owners Abroad's share price closed 4p lower yesterday at 110p, down 37p from
its highest level during the bid.
Owners Abroad's current share price would tend to underline the wisdom of
Airtours' decision to sell in the market the 7 per cent stake it acquired
during the bid.
Airtours is understood to have received about 118p a share, when Owners'
share price was 123p, generating at least 10p a share above the average
price it might have received had it tendered to Thomas Cook and then sold
the balance in the market.
Airtours' share price has also fallen sharply since its 339p high during the
bid. Yesterday it closed up 10 1/2 p at 289 1/2 p.
Only part of this fall reflects the Pounds 9.5m cost of the bid, including
the loss on sale of its stake in Owners.
Thomas Cook's tender ties up the loose ends of the bid which gripped the
travel industry for the first quarter of the year.
Investors and competitors will now be watching with interest to see what
Owners can do with its independence and what Airtours does now that it has
failed to leap into a position to challenge Thomson, the market leader.
The company has already indicated it will spend some of its Pounds 180m war
chest - part of which was raised during the bid through an issue of
convertible preference shares - to increase the size of its retail chain.
Its purchase last October of Pickfords was its first step in this vertical
integration.
While Airtours believes it can continue to grow organically, it also accepts
it cannot continue to grow at the breakneck speed of recent years and is
considering the acquisition of brands.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAYE Communications, a small, privately-held UK company which is a world
leader in wireless telephone technology, has been bought by AT&amp;T, the US
telecommunications group.
The consideration was disclosed, but is thought to be some tens of millions
of pounds. Mr Bill Jeffrey, the founder, will remain chief executive.
Shaye will remain in Winchester and no change of employment is envisaged for
its 60 staff, most of whom are involved in research and development,
The purchase fills a gap in the US company's international portfolio of
wireless telephone products.
Shaye specialises in a form of wireless telephony - CT2 - which has been
unsuccessful in the UK, but looks like being a sizeable success abroad.
Known as Telepoint in Britain, the technology depends on a network of base
stations, or transceivers, in public places which transmit calls from
portable telephones.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH LIFE, Ireland's largest fund manager in the life and pensions market,
reported an 8 per cent drop in embedded value for 1992, from IPounds 540m to
IPounds 494m.
That was better than market expectations which anticipated a fall to IPounds
475m. Funds under management at the year-end amounted to IPounds 4.81bn
(IPounds 5bn).
Principal causes of the fall were adverse tax changes, and losses on
investments of IPounds 40m, of which IPounds 24m was accounted for by the
write-down of the interest in GPA, the aircraft leasing group.
Policyholder funds suffered an additional write-down of IPounds 46m
attributable to the group's shareholding in GPA, but as a result 'neither
our policyholder nor our shareholder funds carry any remaining material
exposure to GPA'.
Overall premium income in the core Irish market fell 8 per cent to IPounds
412m. Individual single premium business, plunged 45 per cent to IPounds
55.7m.
The associated business, Irish Life Finance Group, saw a 29 per cent rise in
its home loans portfolio to Pounds 276m and a 53 per cent increase in its
finance loan portfolio to IPounds 61m.
Premium income in the UK improved 6 per cent in sterling terms, but turned
into an 8 per cent drop on conversion into punts. A drop in dollar premium
income translated into an almost unchanged IPounds 77.7m.
Net profit was IPounds 31.7m (IPounds 30.7m) and earnings 10.54p (10.23p).
The final dividend is 5.44p for a total of 8.44p; last year's payment of
5.44p was the first since privatisation.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Prior placing for Pounds 2.37m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIOR, the property trading and investment group, is proposing to raise
about Pounds 2.37m through an issue of new shares at 2 1/2 p each. The
shares are being conditionally placed by Paribas, but there is an open offer
to shareholders on a 7-for-2 basis at 2 1/2 p.
In addition, it is proposed that the balance of a loan of Pounds 300,000
made to the company by Ardenbell, controlled by the family trust of Mr James
Prior, chairman, be converted into 12m new shares at the placing price. As
Mr Prior and a company associated with him will not be taking up their full
entitlement under the offer, their holding will fall from 61 to 34.74 per
cent of the capital.
It is also proposed to convert each 10p share into one ordinary 1p share and
one 9p deferred share, which will be cancelled.
Agreements have been reached with the group's banks to restructure its
Pounds 4.93m debt. Syndicate banks have agreed to release Prior from its
guarantee of a Pounds 12m loan to a former subsidiary, for Pounds 100,000.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins help Golden Vale rise
13.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDEN VALE, the Irish dairy group, yesterday reported a 13.5 per cent
increase to IPounds 16.7m in 1992 pre-tax profits on turnover marginally
ahead at IPounds 298m, writes Tim Coone.
The company said the increase was due to increases in volume and margins in
the consumer products and food ingredients markets and reduced volume in the
lower-margin primary dairy products markets.
Strong cash flow and working capital management reduced net borrowings to
IPounds 7.5m (IPounds 20.6m), leaving gearing at 8.8 per cent (27.9 per
cent). Mr Liam Irvine, finance director, said that allowed the company to
spend 'another IPounds 30-40m on acquisitions without having to go to the
market'.
The Cork-based company is the largest milk processor in Ireland, processing
700m litres annually - or 11 per cent of the national quota.
Furthermore, through its 74.9 per cent stake in DPP in Northern Ireland, it
is also the fourth largest processed cheese producer in the EC. It intends
to exercise an option to acquire the outstanding stake in 1993. Last month
it made a recommended Pounds 21.7m bid for Leckpatrick, a dairy processor.
Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive, anticipated significant growth in 1993
'based on achieving further development of new products in the consumer
products and food ingredients markets and the expansion of operations in the
UK and Europe'.
A final dividend of 1.13p makes a 1.63p (1.36p) total.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca boosts its Quorn production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, the bioscience wing of Imperial Chemical Industries, is beefing up
production of Quorn, its vegetarian low-fat protein food.
Marlow Foods, Zeneca's wholly owned subsidiary, yesterday announced it is to
invest Pounds 26.5m in new production facilities for its fake flesh food.
The mycoprotein biotechnologically manufacturered product is based on the
micro-fungus fusarium graminearum, a distant relation of mushrooms and
truffles.
The High-Wycombe-based company intends to build two plants, a fermenter at
Belasis, Cleveland, and a processing facility at nearby Stokesley which
should be fully running by 1995. ICI's UK capital expenditure last year was
Pounds 328m.
The plants will increase Marlow's Quorn capacity to 14,000 tonnes a year.
Production is presently less than 7,000 tonnes a year, as a Pounds 37m plant
at Stokesley announced in November 1991 is yet to come fully on stream.
The group refused to give sales figures for Quorn. Two years ago, it claimed
UK sales had increased fivefold from Pounds 3m to Pounds 15m over the
previous five years. Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, believes the
product is a wild card in the company's hand, capable of eventually
generating annual sales of anything between Pounds 200m and Pounds 2bn.
Marlow is part of Zeneca's speciality division, which BZW, one of ICI's
brokers, predicts will increase operating profits from Pounds 26m last year
to Pounds 65m next year on sales up 9.9 per cent. BZW forecasts the
division's profits at Pounds 136m by 1996.
Quorn is commercially available in the UK, Ireland and Belgium. Zeneca said
demand is outstripping supply, and advertising in the UK is being limited to
the London area.
The company aims to capture part of the growing vegetarian food market. Meat
eating is declining in all UK social groups, according to the Vegetarian
Society. More than 5.6m Britons, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the
population, have eliminated red meat from their diets in recent years.
Zeneca said market research suggested 19 per cent of UK households were
willing to try Quorn, and 55 per cent of those were likely to repurchase.
Most of the new capacity will be sold in the Netherlands and Germany and it
will also be marketed in France and Italy. Pilot trials in Amsterdam and
Munich suggests significant potential markets in those countries.
Quorn is available as a fresh ingredient either minced or in chunks and
escalopes. It is also supplied as ready-made casseroles and curries.

FT  15 APR 93 / Digital losses fail to deter as income and costs improve
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment reported larger than expected losses for its third fiscal
quarter, but revenues increased and costs fell, suggesting that the second
largest US computer company is on the way to recovery.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 30.1m (Pounds 19.9m), or 23 cents
per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 311.3m, or Dollars 2.50 per
share, in the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars
3.5bn from Dollars 3.3bn, boosted by favourable foreign exchange trends.
Wall Street had been expecting losses of around 16 cents per share, but
reacted favourably to Digital's financial report. Digital's stock gained
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 41 3/4 yesterday.
'We are meeting the goals we have set for ourselves in returning Digital to
profitability and growth,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief
executive. 'For the first time in six quarters, we generated positive
cashflow from operations and investments, even with restructuring activities
and the loss.'
Mr William Steul, chief financial officer said: 'Our personal computer
business doubled year over year, and service revenues grew 12 per cent.' He
noted however, that without the favourable impact of foreign exchange rates,
revenue would have been flat in the third quarter.
Digital said it shed 4,000 jobs during the quarter, bringing total job
losses to almost 16,000 since the beginning of the fiscal year.
For the nine-month period, revenues were Dollars 10.5bn, up 4 per cent. Net
loss for the nine months was Dollars 364.5m (Dollars 940.4m).

FT  15 APR 93 / Tie Rack increases fivefold to Pounds 5.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIE RACK, the retailer whose neckwear designs range from discreet paisley
patterns to Mickey Mouse, recorded a fivefold increase in profits in the
financial year to January 31.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.1m, up from Pounds 1m in the previous year
when there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 504,000, and the group
doubled its dividend to 1p. Earnings per share rose from 1.99p to 6.1p.
The record results marked Tie Rack's recovery from its dark days in 1989 and
1990 when some commentators predicted it would share the fate of many 'niche
retailers' who failed as the 1980s consumer boom fizzled out.
Tie Rack had come to the stock market in 1987 at a price of 145p. The shares
hit a low of 15p in November 1990, and closed yesterday at 126p, up 10p.
Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said the group had learnt from mistakes, such as
the uncontrolled expansion into the US, and predicted a year of 'solid
progress'. Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said 'it's a marathon, not a
sprint'.
He said the profit rise reflected tighter cost control, a rise in sales
volumes, and closing unprofitable shops and opening new ones. Group sales
rose 23 per cent to Pounds 67m, and operating profits by 155 per cent to
Pounds 4.5m.
Mr Bishko said the group's policy was to run shops itself, rather than to
franchise them, except in particular circumstances. Less than 20 per cent of
the 272 shops are now franchised compared with more than 50 per cent three
years ago.
UK profits were Pounds 4.2m, up 46.4 per cent, and continental Europe and
the Irish Republic made Pounds 1.5m, up 43.3 per cent. Losses in the US fell
from Pounds 856,000 to Pounds 53,000, after the restructuring provided for
the 1991-92 accounts, although losses in Canada rose from Pounds 1,000 to
Pounds 84,000.
Australian profits rose from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 396,000. Associated
profits from the joint venture in France, were up from Pounds 316,000 to
Pounds 333,000 in spite of a weakening of the French economy.
Net cash of Pounds 7.4m at the year-end led to interest receivable of Pounds
292,000, a swing from interest payable of Pounds 539,000. Mr McGinley said
that capital expenditure this financial year would double to Pounds 3m.

FT  15 APR 93 / An industry in great need of a holiday: Queens Moat has
upset the UK hotel sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rocco Forte will today present the results of another miserable year for
the UK's biggest hotel and restaurants group. Analysts who follow the Forte
group expect him to announce a cut in the company's dividend. Expected
profits of just over Pounds 70m compare with Pounds 190m two years ago.
That most City analysts and journalists will be preoccupied with the
financial crisis at the rival Queens Moat Houses will be a mixed blessing
for Mr Forte, who took over from his father as Forte chairman last October.
The positive side of the Queens Moat saga, from Forte's point of view, is
that a dividend cut would now look like a financially prudent step at a
difficult time for the hotel industry. The negative is that the Queens Moat
crisis has cast a pall over the whole sector.
Leisure sector analysts, many of whom had been positive about Queens Moat
until the suspension of its shares on March 31, say investors are likely to
steer clear of the sector. 'Hotels are in bad odour with the City,' says Mr
Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson. 'I can't think of another issue in my
career that's had the effect that Queens Moat has had.'
Buoyed by rising asset values throughout the 1980s, many hotel groups
expanded on the back of borrowed money. Whatever the outcome of the
investigation being conducted at Queens Moat by accountants Grant Thornton,
lenders and investors are likely to be wary about hotel groups' future
growth ambitions, particularly with balance sheets weakened by diminished
property values.
That disillusionment, while intensified by the Queens Moat crisis, has been
evident for a while. Groups with hotel interests, such as Forte, Queens
Moat, Friendly Hotels and Ladbroke, outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share
index for much of the late 1980s and early 1990s, before plunging last year.
Hotels have performed significantly worse during the recession than other
parts of the leisure sector, such as foreign holidays. While the number of
holidays taken abroad last year by UK residents rose to an all-time record
of 21.75m, British hotels suffered the lowest occupancies in living memory.
Mr Andrew Duncan of leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster Associates,
says that while occupancy in London hotels rose 3.8 percentage points to
68.3 per cent last year, this compares with figures in the mid-70s in the 15
years to 1990. Although London occupancies rose as the year went on, the
average room rate fell 3.9 per cent to Pounds 76.97.
In the English provinces, occupancies rose slightly to 56.1 per cent from
55.9 per cent in 1991, but average room rates fell from Pounds 46.24 to
Pounds 44.11. In Scotland, occupancy rose 2 percentage points to 63.1 per
cent, while average room rates remained more or less constant at just above
Pounds 46. When inflation is taken into account, all regions saw substantial
real decreases in room rates. Even last year's occupancy increases are less
impressive than they look, as 1991 figures were blighted by the Gulf war.
Mr Duncan adds that hotel customers who have become accustomed to demanding
discounts are unlikely to drop the habit as economic recovery gains pace.
'The discount culture is very widespread now. The buyers have got used to
value for money over the past few years and it's going to be difficult to go
back on that,' he says.
On the positive side, Mr Duncan says that hotel groups have cut operating
costs during the downturn and that any increase in business will quickly be
reflected in profits. But while occupancies will continue to rise, the hotel
sector's recovery will be slower than many in the industry think. 'It's
difficult to see glimmers of hope,' he says.
Even some hoteliers appear to find it hard to summon up much optimism. Mr
Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Group, which earlier this
month announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.43m in 1992, said only that
'there is a reasonable chance that 1993 will be a better year than 1992'.
Some operators are more upbeat. The devaluation of the pound is bringing
back American visitors, they say. British hotels are of far higher quality
than they were a decade ago. Mr Michael Hirst, chairman of Hilton
International, part of the Ladbroke group, says that unlike some consumer
goods, hotels do not go out of fashion for good. When travel picks up,
hotels do too.
One of the most encouraging features of recent months, he says, is the
increase in UK companies booking hotel premises for training programmes.
'Whenever companies start to accentuate training, it shows they're getting
ready for an increase in business.'
Mr John Jarvis, chairman of the privately-owned Jarvis Hotels group, says he
sees no reason to revise his plans to take his company public within two
years. He says gloom surrounding the industry in the wake of the Queens Moat
saga will lift as summer approaches.
Mr Jarvis says: 'I believe in six months time it will be considered a blip.
This is a high profile industry and it gets far more than its share of
attention compared to industries like engineering or chemicals. I can see us
looking back on this time and saying, 'what was that all about?''
Mr Jarvis says his company's bookings by foreign visitors are up 28 per cent
on last year for the period between now and September. Bookings by
short-break holidaymakers in the UK are up 32 per cent.
Mr Hirst argues that the level of discounting at any time is a reflection of
the balance between supply and demand. When rooms are filled, hoteliers can
afford to reject demands for discounting.
If the tentative recovery in other sectors of the UK economy continues,
hotels are likely to gain from the upturn. While the fax machine and the
telephone have, to some extent, replaced the need to travel, the search for
new customers and the re-establishment of links with old ones requires
face-to-face contact.
Even if the memory of empty rooms fades, however, the shock of the rapid
financial reversal at Queens Moat is likely to linger on.

FT  15 APR 93 / House of Fraser sells Sears stake for Pounds 60m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE of Fraser, the department stores group owned by the Fayed brothers,
yesterday sold its 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears retailing group for a
book loss of about Pounds 60m.
The sale came less than two weeks before Sears was expected to reveal an
improvement in pre-tax profits, and amid reports - firmly denied by House of
Fraser - that the Fayeds have recently been considering a Pounds 300m
management buy-out offer for the House of Fraser stores, excluding the
flagship, Harrods.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, placed the 156m shares at 101p with a
broad range of international institutional investors, having bought them for
100p - a 4p discount to Tuesday's closing price of 104p.
The Fayed brothers have retained a small personal shareholding in Sears.
Mr Michael Cole, a House of Fraser director, said suggestions from City
analysts that the sale indicated the group was in financial difficulties
were 'entirely untrue'. 'Our financial arrangements are entirely
satisfactory,' he said.
Mr Cole confirmed that the Fayeds paid an average of 140p for the Sears
shares in December 1987, making a total of Pounds 218m. Yesterday's sale
represented a book loss of more than Pounds 60m, but Mr Cole insisted the
investment had been 'worthwhile', and had fostered a close relationship with
Sears, including opening concessions within each other's stores.
He said the decision to sell the Sears stake was taken only late on Tuesday
night. The Fayed brothers wanted to realise assets through the sale 'to give
them the flexibility to further their own business plans in the future',
although Mr Cole admitted that some of the money may be used to reduce
gearing.
House of Fraser Holdings' last published accounts, for the year to January
1992, show gross debt of Pounds 776m, with the group due to repay unsecured
bank loans of Pounds 100m and secured loans of Pounds 50m in 1993-4, and a
further Pounds 50m of secured loans in 1994-95.
Mr Cole said yesterday group debt was currently just under Pounds 650m.
Analysts said they were surprised by the timing of the sale.
'I would have thought they would allow themselves the luxury of letting
Sears get their results away before selling the shares,' said Mr Nick Bubb,
retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'The obvious implication is that they
are under financial pressure.'

FT  15 APR 93 / TSB to withdraw from estate agents through N&amp;P deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANKING group TSB is to withdraw from the estate agency business. The
controlled withdrawal will be made by the establishment of a joint venture
company with National &amp; Provincial building society that will manage TSB's
estate agency business and provide a range of financial services.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS estimates that the
deal will cost National &amp; Provincial between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m,
although neither the society nor TSB confirmed the figures.
TSB's chain of 133 residential estate agents has been making losses and in
January the group said it would concentrate on its core businesses of
banking and insurance.
The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 43m in 1992 compared with a loss
of Pounds 47m in 1991. However, there has been little recovery in its
property services division which lost Pounds 6m in 1992 and Pounds 7m in
1991.
TSB is expected initially to retain a 50 per cent share of the estate agency
business, viewing the joint venture as 'an interim step that will lead
eventually to our withdrawal from estate agency business, whilst allowing us
to take advantage of the improving market'.
One analyst estimated that TSB may have invested up to Pounds 50m in its
estate agency chain.
National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth largest society, said that it would
be inviting equity participation in the local estate agency groups and is
expected to buy up the business at the end of the joint venture period.
N&amp;P will be able to use the estate agencies as an outlet for the sale of its
financial services products. The society's branch network is limited and it
is keen to expand its presence in the community. 'The deal suits the
complementarity of each side's strategy,' said Mr Wriglesworth.
A large number of building societies acquired estate agency chains in the
1980s as a defensive measure. They believed that their share of mortgage
lending was threatened by new lenders.
Abbey National last month disclosed that it had lost a total of Pounds 226m
on its Cornerstone residential estate agency.
Woolwich building society disclosed in February that its Woolwich Property
Services estate agency business, which has 257 offices and is the UK's
seventh largest corporate estate agent, incurred a trading loss of Pounds
11m during 1992.

FT  15 APR 93 / US proposes Dollars 4bn fund for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US tried to assert its leadership of international efforts to bolster
Russian reforms yesterday in launching a plan for a Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) multilateral fund to promote privatisation.
The Clinton administration made the proposal at the opening of a two-day
emergency meeting in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrialised
countries, convened to help strengthen President Boris Yeltsin, the
embattled Russian leader.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who will attend the talks
today, delivered a warning that the world might 'slide back to cold war'
without continued western financial assistance to promote reform.
The US proposal is aimed at easing the privatisation of large state
enterprises, which are the most difficult to privatise.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the scheme would free
Russia's central bank of some of the burden of converting the huge oil, gas
and other leading industries to private control; save thousands of jobs; and
reduce inflation caused by the bank's issuing of easy credits to state
industries. Mr Bentsen and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
said the US would provide Dollars 500m for the scheme if other G7 countries
provided a total Dollars 1.5bn. The rest would come from international
instititutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
However, German officials indicated that further large pledges of money were
unlikely, as it had already contributed huge sums to Russian reform. A
senior Japanese official said: 'We have already made our best efforts and we
do not expect to be asked for further money.'
Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said that although
the UK agreed with the emphasis on privatisation, 'all G7 members would want
to consider further how best to pursue that aim'. Canadian officials said
the proposal would require more study, while the Italians emphasised that
the privatisation plan was still a US idea.
Details of the plan will be developed during this morning's closing session,
which will be attended by the Russian representatives Mr Kozyrev and Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister.
The G7 meeting is expected to approve aid worth about Dollars 30bn. Most of
this assistance will be in the form of debt relief and credit extensions
from the IMF that have already been agreed.
Several countries announced new country-to-country assistance yesterday.
Japan confirmed that it was offering Dollars 1.8bn in bilateral assistance,
mainly trade credits.
The UK said it would provide an additional Pounds 383m, while the US said
its contribution to the privatisation fund would be drawn from a Dollars
1.8bn package, details of which are due to be announced today.
Germany, France and Canada said they would not add to existing bilateral
aid. Some ministers complained that 'one-upmanship' was encouraging G7
members to announce ever larger offers, of decreasing effectiveness. One
minister said: 'Our emphasis must be on quality, not quantity.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Government climbs down over changes to competition law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has backed away from radical changes to the law on
anti-competitive behaviour, such as the introduction of large fines on
companies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that ministers
had rejected the idea of a prohibition on abuse of market power by an
individual company, and had decided that the best way forward was to
strengthen the existing law.
The climbdown follows intensive lobbying by the CBI and other industry
representatives, which had expressed deep opposition to the prospect of
fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too cheaply and
refusing to supply certain outlets.
When the green paper outlining options for reform was published in November,
the government indicated that introducing a European-style prohibition on
anti-competitive behaviour deserved 'serious consideration'.
But Mr Hamilton told the House of Commons that consultation had made it
clear that any benefit prohibition might bring to the consumer would be
outweighed by the additional regulatory burden on business. It could even
inhibit rather than promote competition because of the uncertainty it would
create.
He also argued that a prohibition would apply in fewer market situations
than the present law, since to define in legislation what constituted
anti-competitive practices would be less flexible than the existing regime.
Instead, the government plans to strengthen the law in four areas. The
director-general of fair trading will have greater investigative powers,
such as limited rights of entry and seizure. The areas in which he can
accept undertakings enforceable in the courts will be expanded.
The director-general will also be able to make interim orders prohibiting
specific actions by a company while an investigation is carried out by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Ministers will discuss how to deal with cases where specific property rights
are exercised in an anti-competitive way, for example rights of access.
Opposition MPs, who had welcomed the consultation paper, accused the
government of choosing the 'soft option', and expressed concern that
ministers had rejected the call from the Consumers' Association for tougher
action.
Mr Hamilton denied that the government had 'caved in to industry'. It was a
fallacy to believe that opting for a prohibition system would have been in
the consumer's interest.
Not all companies were pleased by yesterday's announcement. Mercury
Communications, which has 11 years' experience of living with a dominant
competitor, BT, said it was 'very disappointed' that the government had not
chosen a more radical option.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, said: 'The costs
argument has been overstated and has been used as an excuse for going for
the option that avoided addressing the real issues.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Tory tensions rise over Bosnia: Attack by Baroness Thatcher
puts British government on defensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Our Foreign Staff and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK GOVERNMENT was forced to defend its policy towards Bosnia yesterday
as a fierce attack by Baroness Thatcher heightened tension among Tory MPs
over the scale of Britain's involvement.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, strongly rejected the former prime
minister's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be allowed to arm themselves -
possibly setting the UK on a collision course with the US.
Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks,
said yesterday that although the US was pursuing 'the diplomatic track', it
was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the peace plan.
Failing that, Washington would soon press its allies for a partial lifting
of the UN arms embargo.
Mr Rifkind said tougher sanctions against Serbia need not be delayed through
Russia's postponement of a UN security council meeting this month - implying
that the 15-day warning period before imposing sanctions could be cut.
He also left open the possibility of Britain's supporting air strikes to
enforce a peace settlement - although such a move would bring the UN into
the conflict as a combatant.
Lady Thatcher continued her attacks yesterday in US television interviews
and in the House of Lords, where she said there was 'nothing moral or right
about leaving a people defenceless in the path of a determined
dictator-aggressor'.
Ministers appeared taken aback by the ferocity of the former prime
minister's words. Although her outburst provoked some ridicule because of
its emotional tone, it found support among some MPs.
Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister, told Lady Thatcher in the
Lords that her proposals might cause 'all-out war' in Bosnia.
An opinion poll today suggests that she also partly reflected public
opinion. A Gallup survey for The Daily Telegraph shows that 61 per cent back
sending an international force to Bosnia to enforce a peace settlement. Two
thirds of those polled said British troops should form part of any such
force.
In Belgrade, the Moslem-led Bosnian government said it would withdraw
support for the international peace plan if Srebrenica, the besieged town
near the Serbian border, was captured by Bosnian Serb forces.
Andrew Hill in Brussels writes: The European Commission will be asked at its
meeting next Wednesday to approve Ecu150m (Pounds 119.55m) of additional
humanitarian aid for victims of the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner responsible for aid, will submit a formal
proposal to his fellow commissioners, with the support of colleagues
responsible for trade, foreign affairs and the EC budget.
If approved, it will bring to Ecu500m the amount of aid granted to the
former Yugoslav republics from the EC's central budget since December 1991.
The Commission approved a first contribution of Ecu60m of aid for victims of
the conflict at the beginning of March.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tour operators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 20 per cent fall in Owners Abroad's share price since it escaped the
clutches of Airtours amounts to an unusually swift judgment. The shares are
still higher than before the bid was launched, but the scramble to accept
Thomas Cook's 150p tender offer hardly amounts to a vote of confidence in
the long-term prospects. Since Airtours has also suffered a bout of post-bid
depression, the conclusion must be that some of the mud thrown during the
fight has stuck.
Yet the prospects look brighter than at the turn of the year. The odds on a
recovery in consumer spending have improved and both report good
early-season bookings. Since the government declined to refer the bid to a
monopolies inquiry, both are free to squeeze independent operators and
improve vertical integration by buying more travel agents. That leaves
plenty of scope for organic growth and piecemeal acquisitions. During the
bid, Owners also promised more savings from its alliance with Thomas Cook.
Bid costs - anything up to Pounds 10m for Airtours, less than half that for
Owners - might take the shine off the shares. More importantly, by
highlighting the scope for price competition the bid did no favours to the
sector. An all-out price war looks unlikely this year while bookings are
well up with expectations and Thomson's market leadership is unchallenged.
Whether the same holds true of next year remains open. The market has
recognised as much.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread's plan to revalue its property holdings has started to generate
nervous anticipation as next month's results draw near. But the move is less
frightening than it looks. Whitbread's south-east presence and its hotels
mean the write-down could be proportionately larger than that of other
brewers. If hints at the interim stage are right, it should amount to around
15 per cent of the Pounds 2.5bn retail property portfolio or Pounds 375m.
But with current gearing of only 16 per cent Whitbread can afford the hit.
That leaves the broader question of the connection between the write-down
and the new accounting standards. Till now companies which sold property
could credit the entire difference between the price and the original cost
to profits. In future, only the difference between price and book value will
count. It thus pays companies like brewers with large property holdings to
reduce the book value of their assets as far as possible, if only to reduce
the risk of having to declare a loss on property sales.
It would be churlish to accuse Whitbread of setting itself up to flatter
future profits. Although property disposals accounted for 17 per cent of
pre-tax profits in 1991-92, sophisticated investors automatically strip them
out. Whitbread's plan for regular property revaluations anyway mean property
profits should largely disappear. The new accounting standards will then
have scored a double hit: stated earnings will be more a reflection of its
basic business and the balance sheet will have become more reliable into the
bargain.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitehall's spin doctors give the impression that only their sensitivity to
Chinese feelings prevents them from crowing about a complete climbdown by
Beijing. The truth is naturally a little more muddy, and the concessions by
both sides show that everyone wants an agreement. There remains a risk that
the talks on democracy in Hong Kong may get bogged down, but a common
interest in success should at least give the discussions some momentum.
Once round the negotiating table, however, it may become clear that the two
sides want very different agreements and are prepared to hold out until they
get them. The enthusiasm of the Hong Kong stock market has thus to be
treated with a little caution. While the tug of war between a strong economy
and poor politics has been temporarily resolved by one side dropping the
rope, the struggle may be resumed. Hong Kong's stock market tends to peak at
a price/earnings ratio of around 12.5. Currently it is trading at around 12
times expected 1993 earnings. Sentiment may pull shares somewhat higher, but
then the rally will be fed by a heavy diet of new issues.
The best of the current rise may thus have passed. Yet unless politics turns
very ugly, the longer-term arguments for Hong Kong are hard to fault. The
economy may grow by 6 per cent in 1993, and a similar amount next year.
Fears that the Chinese economy might overheat are also subsiding. Steady and
sustainable Chinese expansion provides the ideal fuel for Hong Kong's
equities.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Searing pain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About the best that can be said of House of Fraser's investment in Sears is
that the stake was not sold when the shares slumped to 63p. Still, a capital
loss of over Pounds 60m and a similarly painful cost of carrying the shares
leave plenty of room for reflection by all concerned. At present one can
only wonder why House of Fraser has sat with the holding for over five years
only to sell on the eve of a rebound in the economy. Admittedly, Sears is
not the most convincing of the retailing recovery stories. Yet after
enduring the horror of the past few years this hardly seems the moment to
bale out.
Perhaps the answer lies with House of Fraser's very substantial borrowings,
some of which are due for repayment shortly. If the company needs to raise
cash its options are limited. Department stores are not the most saleable of
retailing assets, and the company would struggle to find buyers at anything
like book value. Even putting Harrods on the block might not attract the
kind of clientele which was interested a few years ago.
The company is not alone in its philosophical reflections. Bankers feeling
uncomfortable might also consider that their lending to House of Fraser
looked aggressive even by the standards of the mid-1980s.
For Sears the sale has fewer implications. Sears has to manage the rather
different problem of earning a decent return from its sprawling asset base.
It appears that the new chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, is having some
success with the British Shoe Corporation. Whether he can keep all of the
company's other plates spinning at the same time remains to be proved.

It seems that Russians who smuggled Iraqi asylum-seekers across the Baltic
Sea to Sweden were seeking their own kind of asylum. Life in Swedish jails,
they thought, was better than their cash and job-starved existences back
home.
Prisoners in Sweden are paid allowances of up to 60 crowns a day even for
attending a training course and may be eligible for travel grants when on
parole. So now officials are considering changing the allowances to make a
prison term less attractive for people from countries with a lower standard
of living than Sweden.

Remember, George Bernard Shaw got there first. During the very cold winter

study ways of harnessing the 'monstrous excess of power' in the currents in
the Pentland Firth, which he reckoned could 'electrify half of Europe'. Now
the DTI is catching up. Yesterday's engineering study identified
fast-flowing tidal currents, especially those in the Pentland Firth, between
Caithness and Orkney, as a potential energy source.

The Bank of England is set to lose one of its more cerebral influences. Tony
Coleby, at 57 the eldest of the Bank's four executive directors, is planning
to bow out early next year, thus clearing the way for Eddie George, the
governor-in-waiting, to put his own men into positions of power.
Coleby, the director in charge of monetary issues, intends to go when his
four-year term ends and he turns 58. His replacement in the executive suite
is likely to be 49-year-old Ian Plenderleith, a chain-smoking workaholic who
is 'Hard Eddie's' closest disciple within Threadneedle Street and currently
in charge of market operations.
George, who takes over from Robin Leigh-Pemberton in less than three months,
wants to make sure - whatever the political considerations - that the
government sticks to its inflation target. To help him deal with the
inevitable flak, he will need the help of a similarly hard-boiled colleague.
Assuming Plenderleith makes it into the Bank's top layer, he will join a
team which includes the new deputy governor Rupert Pennant-Rea, 47, chief
economist Mervyn King, 45, international supremo Andrew Crockett, 50, and
banking supervisor Brian Quinn, 56.
Coleby, who joined the Bank in 1961, will be missed at Threadneedle Street
for his erudite approach to economic affairs and a keen interest in choral
singing. He has often brushed with George about the finer points of monetary
policy - a tendency that has not always found favour with the new governor.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What better way to celebrate the start of parliament's new term than to
dabble in Westminster's favourite sport of picking the winners and losers in
the next reshuffle?
Young hopefuls on the Tory backbenches will be ever more effusive in their
public praise of the prime minister, ever more rude about rival aspirants.
The word is that John Major has yet to decide whether his game plan will be
a grand reconstruction, or a cautious refurbishment. But the latter looks
more likely.
Whatever else the PM does, he has to replace Tristan Garel-Jones at the
Foreign Office; he bows out after the Maastricht treaty is ratified. And
there is persistent talk that one cabinet minister is ready to step aside.
But friends of Douglas Hurd dismiss speculation that their man is a quitter.
The foreign secretary will stay at least until mid-1994 before departing for
a lucrative writing and business career.
Michael Heseltine's aides are equally dismissive of talk that their man has
been irreparably damaged by the coal industry debacle and is going to call
it a day. Norman Lamont, meanwhile, has told friends he is convinced he's
safe at the Treasury until next year.
None of that has dented Observer's confidence in presenting a list of
front-runners for promotion. Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury is favourite to
take the first vacant seat in the cabinet, but Jonathan Aitken at defence,
Sir George Young at environment and Roger Freeman at transport are also
showing good form.
Slightly lower down the scale, David Heathcoat-Amory is a strong candidate
for the Garel-Jones job, while Tim Yeo at health and Alastair Burt at social
security are among others who have earned promotion. And if Major does opt
for cabinet reconstruction, watch out for David Hunt, the Welsh secretary.
He deserves grander things than the principality.

FT  15 APR 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia's agony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher's impassion-ed attack on western strategy towards the
carnage in Bosnia has struck a resonant chord. Few who heard can have failed
to empathise with her frustration over the horrors beamed daily to western
television screens and the apparent helplessness of the international
community to do anything about them. Few will have disagreed with her thesis
that the west's current policy of 'feeding people but leaving them to be
massacred' has long ceased to be tenable. It is thus not good enough for
British ministers simply to dismiss Baroness Thatcher's words as 'emotional
nonsense'. The fact is, first, that western policy over the past 12 months
has been worse than ineffective. By making threats against the aggressors
without the will or means to back them up with force, it has encouraged
Serbian territorial expansionism. Second, if the international community
continues to stand aside, seeking to cover its dignity with the increasingly
tattered figleaf of the Vance-Owen peace plan, the land-grabbing will
continue until the vast majority of Bosnia's Moslems have been uprooted from
their homes.
Baroness Thatcher's suggestion is that the UN give the Serbs an ultimatum -
sign up to the Vance-Owen plan, which, though flawed, remains the only
framework for a settlement on the table, or we will selectively lift our
arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia in order to arm the Moslems, while
providing them with air cover.
The merit of this plan is that it would answer the growing moral pressure in
the west for 'something to be done', without entailing the sort of
commitment of ground forces that the US and its allies correctly argue their
domestic public opinion will not wear. Its drawbacks are equally easy to
identify. Apart from prolonging the conflict, it would hopelessly compromise
the existing UN humanitarian relief operation. Even if the Serbs bowed to
such pressure and agreed to Vance-Owen, it would encourage the Moslems to
prevaricate in the hope of western intervention. More importantly, it would
risk provoking a serious split in the UN Security Council as Russia lined up
with Serbia against the west. Far from containing the conflict, it could
help to turn it into a bone of contention on a much larger international
scale.
That danger is what makes this such a delicate moment - especially in
Washington, which is where the important decisions, if any, will be made.
Thus far, the Clinton administration has seemed as uncertain as any of its
allies as to how to handle Bosnia. It appears increasingly tempted to
contemplate lifting the arms embargo on the Moslems - and equally worried
about keeping the Russians and its allies on board. If the pressure for
direct intervention in the war becomes irresistible in Washington, the
challenge will be to square that circle. President Clinton will need all the
cool advice he can muster.

FT  15 APR 93 / Convenient cracks in the wall: Edward Mortimer analyses the
dilemmas and contradictions of European immigration policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few subjects are more intensively discussed between European governments
than immigration, asylum and refugees. There are at least 10
intergovernmental bodies dealing with those issues - 12, if one counts
separately the three sponsored by the Council of Europe. Between them, they
held well over 100 meetings at ministerial or official level in the course
of 1992. Yet most went entirely unpublicised, and very few were front-page
news. Migration is an issue that governments are anxious to talk about among
themselves, but preferably without being overheard.
It is a doubly embarrassing subject. Governments dare not admit to their
electorates that immigration into western Europe has not only increased
steadily (roughly tripling between 1985 and 1992), but will almost certainly
continue to do so. Nor do they like to talk about the methods by which they
try to control it, since these are often hard to reconcile with the human
rights they are pledged to uphold.
Governments are sensitive to public pressure for more restrictive policies -
if possible for the door to be closed completely. They know, however, that
this could only be done, if at all, by methods which would be repugnant to
much of that same public opinion.
Most west European countries stopped recruiting guest workers and introduced
restrictive immigration policies as long ago as the early 1970s. Yet
'regular immigration of foreigners' is now running at 1.3m a year, according
to Jonas Widgren, co-ordinator of the Intergovernmental Consultations on
Asylum, Refugee and Migration Policies in Europe, North America and
Australia. The main source of this immigration is the arrival of family
members joining guest workers who are already in Europe. And, as Doris
Meissner, formerly a senior US immigration official, points out: 'The idea
that a person would be denied the right to have family members with him if
his stay is for long periods is simply unacceptable in many nations.'
Asylum seekers, a category which has recently had much more publicity, were
still only just over half as numerous as 'regular' immigrants in 1992. In
fact the notion of a Europe-wide 'asylum crisis' is highly misleading. The
number of applications in France fell last year from 50,000 to 27,000, and
in Britain, even more sharply, from 44,700 to 9,600. The real crisis is in
Austria, Switzerland, and above all Germany, where nearly 440,000 asylum
seekers arrived last year, and the number is still rising.
In 1992 Germany also took in 300,000 'ex-nationals having a constitutional
right to immigrate' from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. And,
according to the German government, about 310,000 people entered the country
illegally - 'nearly 70 per cent of all illegal migrants to the European
Community'.
The phrase 'illegal migrants' conjures up an image of people packed like
sardines in small boats crossing the Mediterranean or container-trucks on
Channel ferries. But much more typical, according to Clara Maria Bisegna,
diplomatic adviser to the Italian immigration minister, is the cousin who
comes quite legally on a family visit, then illegally finds a low-wage job
in the black economy and overstays his visa. If unlucky he may be caught and
deported. But in a free and open society, his chances of slipping through
the net are good.
The problem is not a purely European one. The influx of people into western
Europe is only a tiny fraction of the overall movement in the world. As Ms
Meissner points out*, 'the vast majority of migrants move within their own
countries, the next-largest share move across national boundaries within the
less-developed world, and a relatively small share cross borders to
developed countries'.
To Americans, accustomed to think of themselves as a nation of immigrants,
European reactions seem unnecessarily defensive. Demetrios Papademetriou,
himself an immigrant, was until recently director of immigration policy at
the US Department of Labor. He argues that in the 'new' countries of the
Americas and Australia 'the process of nation-building has never really
stopped', and people therefore accept that 'national identities are
inherently dynamic, and thus fundamentally mutable'. But this idea, he says,
'is strongly resisted by most intellectuals and publics in Europe', and
therefore mass immigration, especially of people coming from a different
cultural background, is seen as a serious threat to national identity.
Mr Papademetriou was the opening speaker earlier this month at a conference
on 'the security dimensions of international migration in Europe', organised
by an American think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS), but held at Taormina, in Sicily.
Western Europe, according to the American speakers at the conference, is
failing to face up to the facts. It has become a region of immigration. This
is not only the result of 'push factors' - demographic pressure in the
south, war and economic upheaval in the east - but also of 'pull factors'.
In spite of unemployment, there are many low-wage, difficult and socially
undesirable jobs which need doing and which Europeans - along with North
Americans and Japanese - are reluctant to do themselves. 'We must accept the
fact,' said Mr Papademetriou, 'that immigration provides us with prospective
members of our societies who use this complement of jobs as entry-points to
our economies and as access routes to the full rewards of our social and
political systems.' Moreover, the present generation of Europeans has not
produced enough children to provide it with the comfortable old age it looks
forward to; hard-working, youthful immigrants will be needed to make up the
shortfall.
In short, Europe needs immigrants, and Europeans, according to Mr
Papademetriou, are in any case too soft-hearted to keep them out. 'Advanced
industrial countries cannot engage in measures draconian enough to control
situations which have developed their own social and economic logic and
structures without doing gross violence at least to the spirit of their
constitutional order.'
So argue American critics of European immigration policy. Instead of trying
to stop immigration governments should seek to manage it, choosing those
with the needed skills and allowing them to come in legally so that they are
not 'compelled' to pose as asylum-seekers in order to gain admission. This,
supposedly, would give states the 'moral courage' to kick out those whom
they do not want - 'ineligible immigration applicants' and 'fraudulent
asylum claimants'. Eligible immigrants and bona fide refugees could then be
made welcome and given 'full equality'. In due course, they would have the
option of becoming naturalised citizens.
Clearly, European governments are failing in their stated objective of
keeping immigration at, or close to, zero. But it is not obvious that aiming
at a higher, more 'realistic' number would produce better results. The fact
that some immigrants are let in legally will not stop others from trying to
get in illegally. On the contrary, through family connections it will make
it easier for them to do so. It seems quite likely that the number of
immigrants coming in will always be the number allowed plus x. In which
case, if x is the number you actually want, or can more or less cope with,
zero would be the logical number to allow.
What no European government can publicly admit is that illegal immigration
is actually more manageable, and economically more useful, than legal
immigration. Legal immigrants, enjoying all the rights accorded by the law
to indigenous workers, cannot be sent home, and will soon be just as
reluctant as indigenous workers are to do those 'dirty, dangerous and
demanding' jobs. They will naturally expect the same wages and conditions as
indigenous workers, and thus lose their main attraction in the eyes of
employers.
Also, most asylum seekers, even if they do not qualify in the eyes of the
law, are not cynically 'fraudulent'. They are usually desperate people,
escaping from what is by west European standards grinding poverty and
oppression even if at home they were not the poorest or most oppressed. They
are also usually enterprising people, willing to take risks and adapt to
unfamiliar conditions. These might be the very skills an intelligently
'managed' immigration policy would look for. But, again, it is convenient to
keep them in that limbo of 'temporary leave to remain', from which, along
with their illegal brethren, they can be expelled if they cause trouble.
Those, however, are truths that no politician could tell in public.
Offensive as it may be to the descendants of the Pilgrim fathers, a little
old world hypocrisy may sometimes be very useful

FT  15 APR 93 / Leading Article: Doubts about the EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTRAST between the grandeur of Mr Jacques Attali's self-styled
'European Bank' and disbursements of a mere Ecu200m (Pounds 125m) after two
years of existence is bound to attract hostile comment. The institution is
on trial. Yet it is too early to condemn it. The EBRD must be judged on
whether it makes a useful contribution to reform of eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, rather than on the magnificence of its offices or the
flying arrangements of its president.
This does not mean that its housekeeping can be ignored. Some Pounds 200m
was spent on its offices and overheads between April 1991 and the end of
1992. It is difficult to feel confident that the directors responsible for
supervising its expenditures ensured these sums were all essential, since
they are themselves beneficiaries of EBRD largesse.
In this and other respects, the problem lies more with the model on which it
was founded than with the EBRD itself. Politicians complain incessantly
about the 'fat cat' life-style of institutions such as the World Bank. To
this charge, the latter reply that many of their employees enjoy alternative
opportunities in the private sector; that they are not lavish by the
standards of private-sector financial institutions; and that their
performance has been at least as good as that of such institutions.
Populists may dislike these answers, but they have force all the same.
What makes the questions about the EBRD's life-style more pointed is that
many wondered whether it should have been established in the first place.
Some argued that it would divert attention from the need to provide generous
assistance and liberal market access to the newly liberated countries. To Mr
Attali's credit, it is here that the EBRD has been most effective. His bank
offers a fine pulpit. It may be made of Carrara marble, but he has used it
well, particularly on the need for Continent-wide free trade.
Yet the EBRD cannot be justified by the ability of its president to say
sensible things. The question is whether it can also become an effective
lending institution.
Many believed that the EBRD's mandate to lend 60 per cent of its money to
the private sector would prove a crippling handicap. Yet so far the more
important obstacle to rapid disbursement has been the public sector. The
EBRD is affected, like everything else, by the political chaos of most
countries of the former eastern bloc. But lending to the public sector is
not the EBRD's sole problem. Its desire to lend prudently clashes with the
need to take risks in support of the fledgling private sector.
The EBRD has still to justify its creation. It needs to demonstrate control
over its own spending, but above all it needs to lend effectively, without
lending foolishly. This is a fine line to tread. It may never be possible to
be sure that the EBRD serves a useful purpose. But it must make a serious
effort to convince the world it does.

FT  15 APR 93 / Personal View: Morning after the beer bungle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIM WARREN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, British consumers enjoyed a great diversity of domestic and
imported beers and pub prices which were lower than in most other countries.
A rich variety of suppliers served the market, none with a high market
share. Yet the report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1989 found
pub prices to be 'too high', consumer choice to be poor, and viewed the
market as being dominated by big brewers.
The report attributed these problems to brewers owning most of the country's
pubs, where their own products were favoured, and to their offering low-cost
loans to independent pubs in exchange for beer supply guarantees. The
European Commission had found in 1984 that this system benefited consumers,
yet the MMC recommended that large brewers should dispose of most of their
pubs and that supply contracts backed by cheap loans be banned. These
measures would 'increase competition in brewing, wholesaling and retailing,
encourage new entry, reduce prices and widen choice'. Otherwise, it
believed, a few brewers would come to dominate the market.
The government partially enacted the MMC's proposals in 1989, but although
beer supply continues to be competitive, retail beer prices have risen
sharply, and several firms have quit brewing, including local producers whom
the measures were designed to protect. Brand rationalisation continues and
no new producers have entered the market. Indeed, the MMC cleared the
largest brewing concentrations ever seen, involving Grand Metropolitan and
Courage, and Allied Breweries and Carlsberg. Powerful pub groups are
emerging, but independent pubs have closed in large numbers. Since leading
brewers dominate beer markets in countries where tied houses are unknown,
and leading suppliers dominate other UK consumer markets, such outcomes were
always likely. So how did the inquiry produce such proposals?
The Fair Trading Act and Competition Act are both vague in defining the
'public interest'. MMC guidelines suggest that inquiries will focus on
issues of industry structure 'that operate or may be expected to operate
against the public interest'. No evidence of actual harm is needed.
Furthermore, similar evidence may be treated as harmful in one case, but
beneficial in another. Industry structure is presumed to explain and predict
public outcomes. This is a dangerous assumption. Real markets are too
complex to be understood by simple models, largely because they contain
dynamic feed-back effects - a leading firm's market share creates higher
profits that can be reinvested to drive its domination still higher. Such
feedback is common in many social systems, and has unfortunate effects - the
system behaves counter-intuitively and inconsistently, and resists simple
policy changes. This alone may largely explain the unfortunate outcomes of
the beer inquiry.
Problems originating in vague policy objectives and inadequate market models
are compounded by the secrecy of inquiries. Inquiries into beer and petrol
both spent three years collecting considerable data at great cost to firms
and tax-payers. Yet most of this data has nothing to say about the practical
interests of consumers. This omission leads to a largely false view of
industry processes and (for beer) misdirected suggestions for change.
Yet these dangers are not beyond correction. Policy objectives need
clarifying, with more attention being given to practical interests of
consumers, such as choice, quality, service and availability, as well as
price. The priority of inquiries needs to be reversed, placing the public
interest at the forefront, and relegating industry structure to be one
possible explanation of consumer harm, if such harm is proved. Data on
consumers' experiences need greater attention, as does the role of firms
other than those directly under investigation. Reports need to offer a clear
description of industry dynamics for open debate, and explain when and how
expected outcomes will occur, whether or not any change is proposed. An
explicit forecast of how the industry will evolve would focus public debate
on the realism of the assumptions behind the proposals. Finally, a
post-report period for public debate, combined with an open process and
balanced interim reporting, would allow the trade and industry secretary to
arrive at considered changes, rather than having to react quickly to what
might be poor-quality proposals.
The author, who is assistant professor of strategy at the London Business
School, has produced a paper, 'Competition policy and the consumer interest
 -a comparison of recent MMC inquiries', available from the London Business
School

FT  15 APR 93 / Leading Article: Finalising Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration may be right in believing that the new US
Congress would throw out a North American Free Trade Agreement without the
understandings it is now negotiating on the environment and labour
standards. But if it wants a workable agreement, the US should be cautious
about how far it pushes these additional conditions.
One reason for caution is that such side accords could have significant
implications for sovereignty, not only for Mexico but for the US as well.
The envisaged procedures would, after all, be usable not only against
Mexico, as US lobbies desire, but by Mexicans against the US.
Furthermore, the whole point of Nafta is that all the three parties - the
US, Canada and Mexico - should gain from the increased economic efficiency
created by specialisation. Tough side agreements could so load the dice
against Mexican companies that Nafta would become more trouble than it is
worth. It would be wrong and self-defeating for the US to burden a
developing country with the standards of a highly developed one, themselves
rather recently acquired.
In addition, dispute resolution procedures must be transparent and speedy.
Otherwise, they could simply become a way for aggrieved US businesses to
obtain protection. US companies are already all too well practiced at
exploiting such mechanisms, anti-dumping procedures being the chief example.
If it is to avoid these dangers, the Clinton administration needs to keep
reminding itself of Nafta's purpose. True, the main direct beneficiary of
Nafta would probably be the Mexican economy, which should enjoy higher
investment, more jobs and faster growth. But these gains for Mexico would
also bring important benefits to the US.
Pollution should be easier to control, for example, as the Mexican economy
grows, while Mexican industry would also have less reason to cluster in the
contaminated border areas. The differential between US and Mexican wages
should fall, thereby slowing the flow of migrants across the border. A more
dynamic and outward-looking Mexico would become an increasingly important
market for US goods. Not least, the Mexican government would be rewarded for
overturning years of animosity towards the US, while the political
liberalisation of Mexico would be reinforced.
The most powerful economy in the world has little to fear from a free trade
agreement with an economy one-twentieth its size. But it has much to gain
from a stable and increasingly affluent neighbour to the south. The US may
have to negotiate understandings on labour and environment in order to
secure support for Nafta. But it must not deprive Mexico - and so itself -
of the economic and political fruits of this agreement. The US should forget
fair trade theology and remember its interests instead.

FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Contented consultants and their clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was a pleasure to read, in your review of the Centre for Economic
Performance's recent report (Management, April 5), such an elegant
exposition of the guidelines that both clients and management consultants
should follow to favour a productive and satisfying working relationship.
But the review's title, 'A very uneasy alliance', gives the impression that
most relationships end in disappointment on both sides, because the
guidelines are not followed. However, I do not think that the evidence
supports such a conclusion.
For how do consultants go about developing their business pipeline? Doing
new work for existing, satisfied clients is the way that effective
consultants prefer; next comes getting a client's agreement to act as a
reference when approaching new clients. The volume of management consultancy
work that has been carried out in the UK for many years is not consistent
with companies '. . .so often disappointed. . .' with consultants who '. .
.often feel disappointed. . .'
Disgruntled clients and frustrated consultants can always find an audience.
Discontent is more interesting to talk and write about than is satisfaction.
The rest - clients and consultants - are getting on well together, in their
quiet and effective way.

FT  15 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The green shoots sprout again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN

<TEXT>
One reason for the UK Treasury's premature diagnosis of 'green shoots'
recovery was that it took too much notice of surveys which reflected not
hard data such as output, orders or sales, but businessmen's expectations or
their state of confidence. Business expectations are just as much economic
forecasts as computer printouts from the Treasury and have just as large a
chance of being false.
Commentators who have been proved repeatedly wrong about the duration of the
recession and the advent of recovery can grasp at a less ambitious
alternative. This is to recognise the limits of economic prediction and
concentrate on what is happening.
The best procedure is to focus one's attention on a comprehensive aggregate
covering a reasonable period. In the UK context, this is non-oil real gross
domestic product in the first quarter of this year.
The CBI March monthly survey gave a strong hint of an upturn in first
quarter GDP by showing an improvement in reported orders, both overall and
for exports. Even this was far from conclusive because the question is posed
subjectively in terms of whether order books are above or below normal. They
are still below normal but much less so than at any time for over two years.
But the figure I have been waiting for has been the February Index of
Industrial Production which came out yesterday. Here I would concentrate not
on total industrial production, which reflects the vagaries of North Sea oil
output, but on the manufacturing component.
Taking the three months to February, manufacturing output is now estimated
to be 1.2 per cent above both the previous quarter and 1.5 per cent above
the same quarter a year ago. The chart suggests that the year-on-year
movement of the manufacturing index is a good guide to what will afterwards
be reported for GDP, excluding oil and gas, even though the movement in
either direction is often magnified in manufacturing compared with the whole
economy.
Demand indicators give a similar impression. Retail sales have for sometime
been increasing at a moderate rate. The car market has also picked up,
admittedly from a very low level. Construction is probably no longer
declining, although it will take time for the improvement in the housing
market to work its way through to the building sites.
The next question usually asked is whether the recovery can be sustained.
This is wrongly posed. For the tendency in modern capitalist economies is
for output to grow in most years - which enables the governing political
party to make the fatuous boast of record output.
The appropriate question is whether anything is likely to go wrong to derail
or slow down the recovery. The most vulnerable spot is overseas markets. The
world recession came later to Continental Europe than to the US or Japan but
is now quite virulent. The absence of trade figures, while EC recording
methods are overhauled, is no help. Survey data suggests that devaluation
has cushioned it quite a lot. But big feats of export-led growth are
unlikely.
There is another possible leakage. Rising real incomes have been providing
most of the motor for consumer spending, as is normal. But forecasters such
as Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs expect growth in real personal disposable
incomes to dwindle away under the influence of low pay settlements, rising
unemployment and (next year) higher taxes.
They are looking, however, for a falling savings ratio to sustain consumer
spending. The high personal sector debt ratio, which has been acting as a
drag, shows no sign of declining. On the other hand mortgage interest
payments are at their lowest for nearly a decade as a proportion of income.
Too much is probably made of debt deflation and negative equity on the part
of home buyers suffering from price falls. As time moves on the effect of
low interest payments and comparatively low house prices on new buyers will
begin to outweigh the cautionary influence of those who bought their homes
near the top of the boom.
The pain of these earlier buyers will be eased now that house prices have
stopped falling and have risen slightly in the past month. Indeed, looking
ahead, there is more danger of the upturn being threatened by rising house
prices than by any weakness in that sector.
The winter Budget would be a good time to reduce further the fiscal
privileges enjoyed by home buyers. Nothing would do more to stabilise the
economy by 2000 than a new type of housing market, where renting was normal
and an owner-occupied house became a place to live rather than a
speculation.
The most usual reason for pessimism is different; that the British economy
will run into the balance of payments buffers. In fact a so-called payments
deficit can only stop growth if it leads to a run on sterling, which the
government has to counter by a steep increase in interest rates.
So far, on the contrary, sterling has been quite strong and recovered a
little of the ground it lost after leaving the exchange rate mechanism in
September. I would not be surprised if within a year we saw a repeat of the
1987 dilemma in which the government had to choose between letting sterling
rise too far and letting interest rates fall too much.
In the likely circumstances I would let interest rates fall. The recovery of
sterling is welcome as far - or a little further - as it has gone. It should
do something to dampen the impact of rising import prices on inflation and
also discourage the impression now widespread on the Continent that the UK
has embarked on a policy of competitive depreciation. Given a stable pound,
there is enough slack in the economy to take quite a substantial rise in
home demand and still leave room for an increase in exports when the world
economy recovers. Any required real depreciation can be brought about in
slow motion through a lower inflation rate in Britain than in competitive
countries.
This is not a pipe dream. UK unit costs are now falling relative to
competitors - helped not only by low pay settlements but by a rate of
productivity increase in manufacturing substantially exceeding that achieved
at the corresponding stages of previous recoveries from recession.
The straw in the wind about which I do puzzle is the expectation shown in
the Dun and Bradstreet survey that business will take on more workers. Does
this mean that the unexpected fall in unemployment in February was not quite
the freak indicator it seemed? If there really is to be an employment
recovery at such an unusually early stage of the business cycle it may mean
that productivity cannot go on increasing at recent rates. But it may mean
that the upturn is more vigorous than generally supposed. Why back the more
pessimistic alternative while waiting for more evidence?

FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Technology crucial to debate on UK's economic
renaissance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof IAN MACKINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his review ('British culture in the clear', April 8) of W D
Rubinstein's latest book, Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain,
1750-1990, Sir Geoffrey Owen once again contributes thoughtfully to the
debate about the causes of the British industrial malaise. Unfortunately,
however, neither he nor, so far as I could tell, Rubinstein pays due
attention to the importance of exploiting technology.
In my experience, most analysts and historians - whether of an economic or
sociological bent - overlook the salient role which technologies of many
kinds have played in both the rise and fall of the British economy in
relation to most of our international competitors.
For example, the period of Britain's greatest economic (and military) power
was during the 19th century, when it was pre-eminent in its ability first,
to conquer new, basic technologies such as steam and the manufacture of iron
and steel. It then was successful in exploiting these technologies
commercially in the form of artifacts such as bridges, ships, railways etc
and the components (rolling stock and so forth) that went with them.
By comparison, in the most powerful and pervasive technology of the second
half of this century - electronics - substantial British companies able to
compete successfully in relatively free markets on a global scale are
notable only by their scarcity. At the same time, the Japanese (and other
Asian) industrial economies have risen from scratch to giddy heights largely
on the skilful commercialisation of electronic goodies for the home and the
office. And the US economy would be even closer to a sticky end were it not
for its continuing strengths in this massive industrial sector comprising
software, chips, information technology, computers and much else besides.
My main point, then, is that whereas the debate about Britain's elusive
economic renaissance must obviously go on (until we either succeed or relax
finally into a thatched cottage economy), the argument must - simply must -
take technology, and its power to deliver jobs and economic growth, fully
into account in both the analysis of Britain's past successes and failures,
and in building new industrial policies for the future.

FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: No signal of brand's demise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P L STOBART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Morris's decision to impose swingeing price cuts (UK Company
News, April 13) on its Marlboro brand in the US to safeguard its huge market
share in the face of increasing cut-price competition has led to massive
reductions in the share prices of many of the world's leading branded goods
businesses. Suddenly, and in spite of the strong performance of many of
these businesses throughout the recession, some observers are predicting the
demise of the brand.
Surprisingly, it seems that the markets have missed the point. Brand owners
have always had to be highly sensitive to competition from unbranded
products. In commodity areas such as sugar a brand may have no opportunity
at all to establish a price premium while in an area such as fragrances a
branded product may command a price five or six times above that of the
so-called generic.
But the brand is never a licence to charge whatever the brand owner wishes.
At some point the brand will always be susceptible to cut-price competition.
Clearly. a process of readjustment is taking place in the US cigarette
market. But this does not signal the demise of the brand.

FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Central Europe in need of confidence, not handouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JANSEN RAICHL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Marsh's article, 'Caught out by a turning tide' (April 8)
brilliantly highlights the EC's self-inflicted agonies. One has to bear in
mind that the EC is a cold war structure meant to keep Europe divided. For
this reason, central European nations share the wish of most Britons in
seeing the Maastricht process fail.
The central European nations are not as poor and backward as commonly
assumed, and are in fact significant markets. The purchasing power of the
populations of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary at the current
exchange rate is about twice that of Russia; and Poland's is five times as
great. What these nations really need is a boost to their confidence, not
cash or expertise. The foreign press can help in this.
Finally, if Nato becomes more efficient in keeping Russian expansionism at
bay, central Europe will not need to tie itself to the west so desperately.
The anticipated handouts by the Group of Seven nations to Yeltsin are
certain to end up with the Red Army and entail another cold war.

FT  15 APR 93 / Book Review: Pessimistic blast from the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH

<TEXT>
HANDELN FUR DEUTSCHLAND By Helmut Schmidt Rowohlt Berlin, DM 34, 256 pp
When authors start thinking about Germany, they often lie awake at night.
While preparing this passionate recitation of the challenges facing united
Germany (featuring the subtext that, had a certain well-known snuff-taking
statesman remained in charge, things would not be in such a mess), former
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt did not, one suspects, enjoy much sleep.
He reveals that, during preparation of the manuscript, he dreamt a Nazi
government came to power and banned publication of Die Zeit, the weekly
newspaper of which he became co-proprietor after leaving office in 1982.
The nightmare seems to have strengthened Schmidt's conviction that, should
unification go awry, Germany would be threatened by extremism: 'On no
account should we ever again allow a rise of left or right-wing
fundamentalism.'
Schmidt as chancellor between 1974 and 1982 won a worldwide reputation for
brainpower and efficiency. This was, however, only one side of his
character. In this book we glimpse Schmidt the moralist, the schoolmaster
and the patriot.
His point of comparison for today's nation is the Germany of Hitler and the
Germany of the Weimar republic. In view of the legacy of the past, and what
he terms as the Germans' tendency to intolerance and ideological excess,
Schmidt pointedly says that, even after unification, Germany is 'not
normal'.
His central thesis is that reunification is a blessing, but the political
establishment has failed to master the consequences. 'The German nation is
in an infinitely better state than at any time since 1933. All Germans are
free; all are equal before the law; we have elected our government and can
vote for another one; we need fear neither violence by the state, nor secret
police; our standard of living is high; our external security is not
seriously under threat. At the same time our situation is in no way
satisfactory. We have made serious errors, and we are placing ourselves in
further danger through prejudice, egotism and sloth.'
Although his views sometimes appear over-pessimistic, the persistence and
clarity with which Schmidt puts them forward are admirable.
It is a pity that he allows the contempt with which he regards his
successor, Helmut Kohl, sometimes to cloud his judgment.
Kohl wins praise for having seized the chance of German unification in 1990.
Otherwise, the chancellor is portrayed as a combination of knave and
buffoon. 'Practically everything else which Kohl undertook after October 3
1990, the date of German unity, was partly wrong, partly mistaken, too
hesitant and too late.'
Schmidt indulges in his leaning towards apocalyptic views when he writes in
the opening chapter that missed chances since 1990 raise the risk that
united Germany could have 'only a limited life'.
But his overall conclusion is surely correct. The passage of German unity
has been made still more difficult by policy errors in Bonn, principally the
government's underestimation of the hurdles facing economic recovery in the
east. He believes that, unless Germans in east and west show a far greater
willingness to share the burdens of reunification, Europe's pivotal nation
will remain unsettled for a relatively long period.
In laborious detail, Schmidt sets out problems and solutions. He covers
everything from asylum policy and the Bundeswehr to measures to reduce the
budget deficit. In view of the recession, he is against tax increases for
the moment. Schmidt calls on the Bundesbank - his bete noire - to cut
interest rates substantially. And he takes the central bank heavily to task
for obstructing the road to European monetary union. It is 'unhealthy', he
says, that the Bundesbank president appears more powerful than the German
foreign minister.
The best parts of the book are where Schmidt shows his more human side.
There is a somewhat puritanical streak here. A fierce assailant of the
debilitating influence of television, he suggests that schoolchildren hold
regular classroom discussions on the nature and content of television
programmes. Schmidt closes the book with an emotional and eloquent appeal
for ordinary Germans to tighten their belts and show 'solidarity' to make
unification a success.
For all the power of his arguments, the book has some shortcomings. One
lacuna concerns his own previously held views on German unity. As late as
summer 1990 he was on record as predicting East German unemployment would
start to fall as recovery took place from 1992 onwards. Some hint of the
fallibility of his earlier predictions would not have come amiss.
Schmidt also seems to hold fluctuating views on the political reliability of
his countrymen. In connection with post-unity decision-making, he writes: 'I
have no real confidence in the political constancy of our people.' Yet he
also claims that the German electorate 'have understood our position and our
difficulties better than the politicians'.
The most important contradiction involves Europe. Although a convinced
supporter of European union, he indicates that a unified Europe will not be
possible until his own country 'has brought the process of German unity,
politically and economically, to a successful conclusion'.
By then, however, it may be too late. For Schmidt also records that if
Europe does not adopt a single currency by 2000, 'the D-Mark will, with
virtual certainty . . . dominate the whole of Europe'.
Because of the burdens of history, and his lack of faith in the political
acumen of his compatriots, Schmidt does not want the D-Mark to rule Europe.
His account none the less leaves the reader with the impression that this
will be the most likely outcome.

FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Dustin Hoffman versus Our Lady of the Lingerie -
Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCIDENTAL HERO (15) Stephen Frears
BODY OF EVIDENCE (18) Uli Edel
Dustin Hoffman in Accidental Hero plays a petty crook seized by a sudden
surge of selfless bravery. One rainy night he rescues 54 people from a
burning plane.
There he is, juddering through outer Chicago in his noisy-wipered car, when
the steel monster falls from the sky. Soon the passenger plane is lying
across the road, its fuselage steaming, its drooping snout caricaturing
Dustin's own. With a sigh our hero climbs from his car, doffs his Dollars
100 shoes, sloshes through the rain, does his bravest, then vanishes into
the night.
This movie has everything. Comedy, drama, air crash, lovable superstar,
script by David (Unforgiven) Peoples, and the wonderful Geena Davis as a
survivor-newsreporter who sleuths after the 'accidental hero.' Yet we keep
thinking, 'When is it going to start?'
Rhythm is the most elusive of movie qualities and it is
missing-presumed-fled for most of Accidental Hero. Just when the story has
begun to make sweet music with its contrapuntal portraits of Hoffman, the
gutter-bred crook trading in secondhand patter and stolen credit cards, and
Davis, the high-flying journo seeking a 'human interest' scoop, a third
character ruinously interlopes. This is Andy Garcia, underscripted and
underplayed as a sweetnatured hobo who claims a newspaper's Dollars 1m
reward by claiming he was the phantom rescuer. (He has come into a vital
piece of evidence).
And just when we think the story is dancing brightly, caustically to the
themes of press-and-media folly and the paradoxes of heroism, in come
disruptive stretches of andante (Garcia romancing Davis) or adagios of soggy
folk wisdom exchanged between Hoffman and his young son.
British director Stephen Frears usually goes straight for the vernacular of
human behaviour. His best films - My Beautiful Laundrette, The Hit,
Dangerous Liaisons - present human beings demotically, sardonically, as
chattering egos and appetites on legs. But a large-budget Hollywood project
brings its own baggage of populist bet-hedging. Accidental Hero's cluttered
plot and style testify not just to the three names in the 'original story'
credit (Laura Ziskin and Alvin Sargent as well as Peoples) but to a desire
to provide Something For Everyone. Schmaltz with the cynicism; romance with
the misanthropy; young pretender (Garcia) with ageing superstar.
The result is less a healthy balance of ingredients than a recipe for
frustration. By final reel the movie has become mercilessly
multi-directional. Newshound Davis shuttles between her two hero suspects;
Hoffman shimmies between anonymity and limelight; minor characters yell for
their last two cents' worth of screen time (Chevy Chase's newspaper editor,
Joan Cusack as ex-Mrs Dustin). And let us throw in a final suspense vignette
with Hoffman and Garcia teetering on the high ledge of a skyscraper. It is
at once too much and too little. As so often in cinema, 'something for
everyone' means not enough for anyone.
The week's only other release is Body Of Evidence: a large, squishy,
self-important object masquerading as a movie. The star is Madonna, whose
screen career continues to take two steps backward for every one step
forward (Dick Tracy, A League Of Their Own). Here Our Lady of the Lingerie
is accused of using her body to murder a rich old man who died in the throes
of sexual ecstasy.
True or not, she is soon doing much the same to defence counsel Willem
Dafoe. He has no defence against a woman whose love techniques range from
dripping hot wax on his genitals to coupling on a car bonnet strewn with
glass from a smashed lightbulb. (We are in the courthouse's public car park
at night).
Occasionally bits of plot break into the sex scenes, with the awkward
diffidence of a butler asking if Moddom and the gentleman would like some
tea. Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer and other worthies stand about the courtroom
doing the where-were-you-on-the-night-of routines. Then it is back to the
handcuffs, hot wax and car bonnets. If Mr Dafoe were a Chevrolet he would be
in mint condition by the end of this film.
In a thin movie week - no, let us call it skeletal - you can always read
about films rather than seeing them. My spring bookshelf is buckling under
the new movie tomes: not least those representing that major modern trend,
the 'So-And-So on Himself' monograph.
Best of these are Malle On Malle (Faber, Pounds 14.99) and Levinson On
Levinson (Faber, Pounds 8.99). Both are short on preamble and long on
substance. In the first, editor-interviewer Philip French gives us a brisk
prefatorial trip through Malle's early life - born into the Beghin sugar
dynasty, educated by Jesuits (see Au Revoir Les Enfants), baptised as a
film-maker in Cousteau's deep-sea documentaries - and then plays Plato to
Malle's Socrates as we movie into film publishing's answer to a Platonic
dialogue.
Malle's talk is as good as his films, alive with supple details and sudden
revelations. On the difference between cinema verite and cinema direct; on
the Vuillard paintings he looked at as inspiration for Pretty Baby; on the
knack for finding the right unknown actor for a lead role (Pierre Blaise in
Lacombe Lucien); on the challenge of making an all-talk film 'cinematic' (My
Dinner With Andre). His versatility of style and range of interests as a
film-maker have made Malle outlast the New Wavers he grew up alongside
(Godard, Chabrol, Rivette) and next to whose dry avant-gardism he seems a
maverick humanist.
Barry Levinson's articulacy is more plainspun. This gifted social fabulist
specialises in the underside of the American Dream: the lives of the
dispossessed (Diner, Rain Man) or dispossessing (Bugsy). As a talker, his
style can be as tousled and rambling as his characters'. (Editor David
Thompson might have used a bit more scissorwork). But there are witty tales
and revealing insights: especially about the constant war in film-making
between perfect blueprint and brute reality.
For Memory Lane movie buffs, what better than Aljean Harmetz's Round Up The
Usual Suspects (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 15.99)?. Celebrating fifty
years of Casablanca, the author rounds up some usual and unusual stories
about the making of everyone's favourite Hollywood potboiler. You will read
about a casting near-miss for Ronald Reagan, about just what Humphrey Bogart
did say to Dooley Wilson at the piano (after Wilson came in as casting
replacement for Ella Fitzgerald), about Paul Henreid and the 'white suit
controversy', and about whether anyone knew what the film's ending would be
before the day came to shoot it.
As for why the film has become a perennial, Harmetz lays out the choices:
from those seeing a gay subtext in Rick/Bogart's friendship with
Renault/Claude Rains to others claiming an allegory about President
Roosevelt hesitating to commit America to the Second World War. Far-fetched?
Ah, but Harmetz reminds us that 'Casablanca' is Spanish for 'White House.'
Casablanca goes unmentioned in Christopher Palmer's The Composer In
Hollywood (Marion Boyars, Pounds 19.95): no doubt on the grounds that Max
Steiner had to score the film around someone else's tune. But if 'As Time
Goes By' robbed him of royalties, Steiner's Gone With The Wind theme made
up. Who can ever see a poster or still picture from that film without
mentally hearing those soaring strings?
These and other harmonic brainstorms are the subject of Palmer's book.
Despite the odd solecism - The Snake Pit was hardly 'the first picture set
in a lunatic asylum' ( The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari pre-dates it by 30 years)
 -this is a plain man's guide written without plainness. Read Palmer waxing
eloquent on Miklos Rosza's Ben-Hur score, on Bernard Herrmann's screeching
Psycho strings or on Franz Waxman's weaving of styles in the moody and
marvellous Sunset Boulevard score. 'The theme is set in the Phrygian mode
 .Hispanic overtones ..motoric rhythms ..nonchalantly syncopated.' Who says
that scholarship and showbiz cannot live in productive harmony?

FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Order and chaos in Arcadia - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the possible exception of Michael Frayn, Tom Stoppard has long been the
wittiest of contemporary British playwrights and one of the longest running.
His Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead opened at the National Theatre
over 25 years ago and has been an international success ever since. Of the
British dramatists who came to the fore in the early 1960s, only Harold
Pinter has kept up with him in terms of reputation.
Stoppard can cope with a complex brief, like the moral philosophy in
Jumpers, which was reviewed in the Sunday Times not only by the theatre
critic but also by the philosopher A J Ayer. It has been said that he
regards writing a play as an examination: 'He spends ages on research, does
all the necessary cramming, reads all the relevant books, and then gestates
the results. Once he's passed the exam - with the public and the critics -
he forgets all about it and moves on to the next subject.'
In Arcadia, his subject is higher mathematics, not forgetting his work on
physics in Hapgood. The production, directed by Trevor Nunn, is faultless.
The lighting by Paul Pyant is immaculate. There is nothing much wrong with
the acting, but I wish I could say more for the play.
Stoppard has always written about the contradictions and apparent
similarities between order and chaos. Here he takes on too much, some of
which is not remotely theatrical. There is the love life of Lord Byron and
landscape gardening. The presentation of non-linear mathematics will seem
self-evident to anyone who tries, however distantly, to follow economics.
Others will find it distracting in a play that wanders between the early
19th century and the present. Nothing is proved; not much happens.
Kenneth Tynan suggested a rule about Stoppard is that 'the shorter the play,
the harder it is to summarise the plot without sounding unhinged'. Arcadia
defies the Tynan dictum. It runs for over three hours, yet the plot is
unclear. No-one knows who made love to whom, nor is there any reason to
care. Byron never appears. Instead there is a minor poet called Chater who
does not look or sound like a poet at all. There is also a landscape
architect named Noakes who, played by Sidney Livingstone, might develop into
an interesting character if allowed to do so. Stoppard cuts him off.
That is the 19th century bit. The modern bit is - to use a Stoppard word -
no less a travesty. There is a don called Bernard Nightingale (played by
Bill Nighy) who no more resembles a scholar than Chater resembles a poet.
The name, so similar to that of the chief theatre critic of The Times, may
be a private joke by Stoppard. It is not very funny. Bernard Nightingale is
one of the weakest parts. Benedict Nightingale would have written the lines
much better.
There is also Felicity Kendal who is a very good actress. She plays an
author who has written about Byron. Why she is so cold to those about her is
left, like so much else, uncertain. Possibly this is the cooling theory of
the universe.
The paradox is that some of the lines and situations are very good, but none
of them comes from Stoppard's erudition. Most belong to Ms Kendal, such as
her response to the gardener advising her to advertise for a hermit to put
in his hermitage in the newspaper: 'But surely a hermit who takes a
newspaper ..?' This is the Stoppard of old, and there is not enough of it.
Still, do not be deterred. Here we have the National Theatre trying to be
witty and serious at the same time and an audience willing it to succeed.
It's a near miss. Tynan would have cut it. He wrote that 10 days before
first night Jumpers was running close to four hours. Told by Lawrence
Olivier that Stoppard would object, Tynan as dramaturge imposed the cuts
unilaterally: no-one demurred and it became a much better play.

FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Royal Opera House forecasts operational surplus of
Pounds 266,000 for present financial year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera House is projecting an operational surplus of Pounds 266,000
for the financial year 1992-3.
At yesterday's press conference, Sir Angus Stirling, the ROH Chairman, was
in a quietly bullish mood as he revealed how the house managed to confound
gloomy forecasts for the period.
The sum had been achieved by a 'year of steely endeavour' - economies in
night-work, Sunday rehearsal and overtime, a wage freeze from last
September, and alteration of the performance schedule by means of production
cancellations and extra performances.
The opera and dance companies have notched up an average 85 per cent
capacity, more than the house's achievement previously, which compares very
favourably with the West End's 64 per cent during the same period. The
surplus, together with an anonymous donation of Pounds 500,00 (the first
part of a gift of Pounds 2.5m, which is to be spread over the next three
years), will go further toward reducing the accumulated deficit. Since the
house is also budgeting for a surplus in 1993-4, they expect that deficit to
be eliminated by the end of the next season.
At the same time as giving these figures, the ROH published a response to
the recent Arts Council Appraisal under Baroness Warnock in the form of a
point-by-point listing of the committee's recommendations - the majority
accepted by the management - together with the steps that have already been
taken to implement them. Among these is the decision to widen the
constituency of the ROH Board so as to render it more accountable: in
future, all appointments will be made with the approval of the Heritage
Minister.

FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: New York Philharmonic 150th anniversary season -
Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under their new(-ish) music director Kurt Masur, the NYP played the Royal
Festival Hall on both Monday and Tuesday. Monday's was the solider programme
' Mozart, Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel and the Second Symphony of Brahms. On
Tuesday, besides Samuel Barber's familiar Adagio we got only Dvorak's 'New
World' Symphony (probably a bigger draw in the New World than in London
now), and a wholly unfamiliar work by a Sino-American composer: plenty of
room left for encores, and many seats going spare at Pounds 40.
In distinguished form for its 150th anniversary season, the NYP was a
continual pleasure to hear. And not only in the departments where all the
best American orchestras excel - brilliantly reliable brass, strong,
thrusting cellos, ultra-precise rhythms all round; for in Masur the
orchestra has found, after some post-Bernstein ups and downs, just the
echt-European musician they needed and deserved ('at this point in time', as
they might say).
Most of those other orchestras are happiest when loud and dazzling, and a
few of them cultivate a dramatic pianissimo too. Masur, however, seems to
have made the NYP sensibly, graciously at home with all the gradations in
between. Even in their Strauss it wasn't the extremes that counted most, but
the main argument - steady, temperate, scrupulously shaded, with each
orchestral section contributing a unanimous voice. They seemed two or three
times as well-rehearsed as our London orchestras do at home (but so do ours,
often, when they're abroad).
The glory of these two concerts was beyond doubt the NYP's Brahms no. 2. It
is not a personal favourite: many a music lover may think, as I usually do,
that Brahms's towering academic ingenuity here was disproportionate to a
fairly tame range of feeling, and would for choice hear his 1st or 3rd or
4th symphonies instead. While Masur's performance lasted, one couldn't have
thought that. From top to bottom the polyphony sounded vital, fluent and
pointed, at once densely expressive and sunnily transparent. To jaded ears
it came as a tonic and a hugely professional revelation; it flowed cogently,
glowed and convinced.
Strauss's Till was more 'interesting' than persuasive. Masur's natural
sympathies do not run to unbuttoned fun. We had to be content with a vivid
(but always coolly contrived) pounce-and-splash here and there, amidst the
deliberate workings-out. There was an ace first horn, and for the violin
solos the NYP leader's bright, sweet, fast-vibrato tone was just right. Less
so in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, where he sounded tight and over-pretty
 -probably because his young co-soloist Cynthia Phelps, the NYP's new(ish)
first viola, is a model of lovely, straight-speaking musicianship.
On Tuesday Dvorak's 'New World' seemed to aspire beyond its homely deserts '
ethnic cosiness is not Masur's forte ' toward a slightly fictitious
grandeur, despite Thomas Stacy's dewy cor anglais solo in the Largo.
'Bright' Sheng's H'un (his American forename translates his Chinese 'Liang',
and the title means something like 'wounds') proved to be a bitter epitaph
for the Cultural Revolution, through which he lived in his teens before he
fled to America in 1982. From a standpoint of Political Correctness his
20-minute piece is faultlessly sincere: first, variously shrill evocations
of horror (with Chinese bass drum), and then numb, grievous reflections.
On first hearing, nonetheless, H'un struck me as short-breathed and
under-composed. Further acquaintance might discover deeper patterns; or
perhaps its patterns respond too closely to the folk-music of Qinghai
Province on the Tibetan border, where Sheng spent his formative years, for
Western ears to cotton on to them easily. While the passing sounds were
pungent, the musical sense remained opaque, bitty and generalised.

Patsy Bloom, managing director of Pet Plan, was yesterday named the 1992
Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year.
Her company, which specialises in insuring small animals and horses, was set
up 16 years ago with a Pounds 250 loan when Bloom discovered that no company
would insure her dog. Pet Plan now holds 51 per cent of the small animal
market and a large slice of the leisure horse market; the concept is
franchised in Italy and Canada. Turnover has increased from Pounds 7.8m in
1989 to a projected Pounds 20m in 1992.
Previous winners of the award include Anita Roddick, founder of the Body

Colin Mayer is returning to Oxford for the second time since his
undergraduate days, this time as Peter Moores professor of management
studies, a flagship post for the university's new business school.
It was only at the beginning of this academic year that Mayer took up the
chair of economics and finance at Warwick; but he says that the Oxford
position was 'made available a bit earlier' than expected. There will be
some overlap in the jobs, as he has agreed to see out his responsibilities
at Warwick for the next academic year as well, while formally starting in
Oxford next April.
As deputy director responsible for the school's academic development, he
will report to the director of the School of Management Studies, Clark
Brundin. The two have crossed paths before; when Mayer read engineering
science and economics, Brundin was one of the lecturers; later, when Mayer
was appointed to the Warwick job, Brundin was vice-chancellor.
Of the Warwick connection, Brundin comments: 'It was genuinely pure
coincidence. I chaired the committee that appointed him to Warwick, but it
is not proper to go headhunting in one's old institution.' Instead Mayer's
name was put forward by a member of the electoral board.
Mayer, 39, worked in the Treasury for two years before taking up a
fellowship at St Anne's College, Oxford. More recently he was professor of
corporate finance at City University. He has researched extensively into the
effect of financial systems on corporate activity, and says he is shifting
focus now more towards relations between companies - cross-shareholdings and
the like.
Aside from research, he sees his new role as 'attracting the very best
academics and helping to design first-rate courses'.
Oxford is now looking for a deputy director in charge of the MBA programme,
at Reader level.

FT  15 APR 93 / People: Investment Trust figurehead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund manager, has reaffirmed its strong
Scottish roots by appointing Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger as
its investment trust figurehead.
Lord Younger, 61, a member of the George Younger brewing family and former
secretary of state for Scotland, has been appointed chairman of Murray
Income Trust, Murray International Trust, Murray Smaller Markets Trust and
Murray Ventures, the four main trusts which are managed by Murray Johnstone
and which also control the firm. He takes over from Sir Ian Denholm, 65, the
Scottish ship-owner, in the chair since 1985.
Nick McAndrew, Murray Johnstone's chairman, has known Lord Younger since
their schooldays together. 'I asked him if he would like to have a job on
the west coast as well as the east coast, and he accepted,' says McAndrew,
who notes that Younger lives halfway between Murray Johnstone's base in
Glasgow and the Royal Bank's Edinburgh headquarters.
Although it is relatively unusual for a fund manager to appoint the same
chairman to all its investment trusts, McAndrew says that 'it is the way we
have historically done it'. He did not think the practice raised any
corporate governance issues and stressed that the boards of the Murray
trusts were made up of independent non-executive directors. Unlike some
competing trusts, his fund managers did not sit on the boards of the Murray
trusts.

FT  15 APR 93 / People: Interventionist climbs Whitehall ladder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taking a further step up the Whitehall career ladder is Robin Mountfield,
53, who is to become the Treasury's new deputy secretary in charge of civil
service pay and management. The job provides a broad perspective of the
civil service and has been used in the past to train promising mandarins for
the top Whitehall role of permanent secretary.
Mountfield, who has been at the Treasury for less than a year after a
19-year stint at the DTI, is currently head of the Treasury's industry
division.
For most of his civil service career Mountfield has been known as an
unashamed interventionist, who was thrilled by his 1970s job of taking the
aerospace industry into state ownership. It is testimony to his flexibility
of character and good nature that he continued to prosper during the laisser
faire years of Lady Thatcher.
With the UK government now stepping up efforts to make Whitehall more
sympathetic to the needs of industry, Mountfield probably feels his star is
in the ascendancy. Taking over from him as head of the Treasury's industry
division, which also carries the rank of deputy secretary, is Steve Robson,
49, who is currently in charge of the Treasury's public enterprises group
and is an expert on public expenditure.
Mountfield replaces Michael Scholar who becomes permanent secretary at the
Welsh Office. Scholar displaced Hayden Phillips, who left the Treasury to
become permanent secretary at the Department of National Heritage.

FT  15 APR 93 / Technology: Breathing life into the oilfields - The Brent
field is making world oil history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell UK rolled out the superlatives last week when it announced a Pounds
1.3bn project to extend the life of the Brent field in the North Sea. It
said the project was unique, a landmark in world oil history and the biggest
single project undertaken in the history of the UK North Sea, with the
possible exception of the development of Brent in the first place.
The scheme, which Shell and its subcontractors have already begun, is aimed
at extracting more oil and a great deal more gas from the Brent field,
already the biggest combined oil and gas field in the UK North Sea. It means
Brent should still be in production by about 2010, instead of closing as
originally planned in 1998.
The project entails reducing the pressure in the field, by making large
modifications to three of its four production platforms. Depressurising an
oilfield is almost unheard of, but depressurisation is standard practice in
gas fields. What is happening is that Brent is gradually being converted
from an oilfield into a gasfield.
Shell UK believes this operation has been carried out on an oilfield only
once before, on a tiny scale in the US. The Brent redevelopment is unique
because of its scale and because it is being carried out in the notoriously
hostile waters of the northern North Sea - about 120 miles off the Shetland
Islands. The field will remain in production at a reduced level during the
five years the work goes on.
Though the work will be carried out on the vast steel platforms, its effect
will be felt in the unseen world of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, lying
between 8,700 and 9,400 feet below the seabed. The two reservoirs, one above
the other, consist of porous sandstone which contains oil in which gas is
dissolved.
In common with most reservoirs, pressure in Brent was high when Shell began
producing in 1976. This helped the oil to flow through the wells up into the
platforms, but so that pressure was maintained as oil was removed, water was
pumped in, a standard oilfield method known as waterflood. The high pressure
locks the gas into the oil and currently the gas is separated from the oil
on the platforms, which are really offshore process plants. The theory
behind depressurisation is that the gas is allowed to come out of the
solution of oil and gas naturally.
The first stage of depressurisation, beginning in 1997, after two of the
platforms have been converted to low pressure facilities, is to stop
injecting water. The reservoir pressure will begin to fall, liberating
increasing amounts of dissolved gas from the oil. However, to prevent the
reservoir ceasing to produce oil at all, some gas will be injected into the
wells to bring the fluid up to the platforms for separation.
The second stage - deep depressurisation - will begin early in the next
century. This time, pressure will be allowed to drop further by limiting the
flow of water into the reservoir from the aquifer which lies underneath it.
To do this the wells and pumps which were previously used for injection will
be used to extract water, supplemented by submersible pumps.
By the end of the operation in about 2010 the pressure in the reservoir
should have fallen to 1,000lb per square inch (70 times atmospheric pressure
at sea level) from the 5,500lbs per sq inch in 1997.
To make the operation possible the Brent Bravo, Charlie and Delta platforms
will each be shut down for a year to remove redundant gas separation and
compression equipment and install new process modules. Brent Alpha will be
upgraded but not converted to low-pressure operation. All four will be
refurbished and upgraded for longer life and new safety standards.
By the time the Brent field is abandoned, some 55 per cent of all its oil
and 80 per cent of its gas should have been recovered. Brent's recoverable
gas reserves should have been boosted by 1,500bn cu ft to 5,400 bn cu ft,
and its recoverable oil reserves increased by 34m barrels to almost 2bn
barrels, the equivalent of adding a small oilfield and a medium-sized
gasfield to the UK's hydrocarbon reserves.

FT  15 APR 93 / Technology: Fax for advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A perennial problem for advertisers is to ensure that readers, listeners or
viewers of their commercials phone up for more information. Freefone
telephone numbers are 'instant', but they are expensive to operate.
LBC, the independent London radio station, is pioneering a service in the UK
which is considerably cheaper to operate than traditional 'phone-in inquiry
services and is available to anyone with a facsimile machine.
Advertisers give a fax number at the end of their commercial and supply LBC
with the documents to send to listeners. When the consumer telephones the
number the document is automatically transmitted.
The cost to the advertiser is Pounds 25 per week for the telephone line plus
15p per minute for the calls. 'The advertisers have control of the costs,'
says Bob Cole, chief sales manager for LBC. 'If they want to send 10 pages
of information it's up to them. If they can squeeze all the information on
to one sheet then it's much cheaper.' The caller pays the cost of an
ordinary telephone call.
The Q-fax service works because almost every fax machine in the country has
a little-used function known as 'polling'. During the transmission of a
normal fax message the transmitting machine first sends out a message giving
its identity. With polling, the other machine recognises this number and
then sends back the required document.
Henry Fletcher, managing director of Eurofax Communications, which offers
the Q-fax service, believes it could be used to support many kinds of
advertising and promotion.
Cole believes the initial interest, however, will be for
business-to-business advertisers. He cites the example of financial advisers
who can use the radio to advertise generic services and then send details,
including all the small print, by fax. 'It makes radio a much more
measurable medium,' he says. 'It's existing technology but with a major
twist.'

In the office, at home, in the car, in a briefcase, the facsimile machine
has crept into everyday life. But few companies have any policy on the way
fax machines are used, or even know how much they cost to use.
'The true bottom line of running a fax machine is never known. There is no
centralised control whatsoever in many companies,' says Meredith Fischer,
vice-president of marketing at Pitney Bowes' fax division. 'It's time to
start setting fax policies,' she continues. If not, she warns, companies
'will continue to bleed money'.
Companies which have set a fax policy have noted tremendous financial
savings coupled with improved management control.
CT Bowring, one of the UK's largest Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance
brokers, installed a centralised fax switch from Comwave. Clement Lim, UK
director of Marsh and McLennan Information Services, which owns CT Bowring,
reports substantial savings - Pounds 500,000 over five years is a
'conservative' estimate, he says. Nor does that take into account the
tremendous increase in the number of faxes sent - up from 1.2m pages a year
to 2m.
Although the boom years for fax equipment are over, the use of fax machines
is spiralling upwards. A survey conducted by Gallup for Pitney-Bowes shows a
remarkable surge over the past year. In 1991-92, Britain's top 1,000
companies reported sending an average 40 documents a day; this year, that
figure was up to 93 documents. 'Unless something fundamentally changes in
the way we use fax there is really no escaping that volumes will go up,'
says Fischer.
Fischer argues that companies are slow to calculate the accumulating costs
of faxed documents. She advocates analysing for each machine the number of
pages received and sent and the proportion of those received on thermal
paper which are then photocopied. 'If you don't go through this process you
don't know what you're spending. The numbers get so huge, everybody laughs
at you.'
At the most basic level, there is the decision about whether to swap cheaper
thermal fax machines for machines which use photocopier paper. Recessionary
times have forced down the price of plain paper faxes to around Pounds
2,000, scarcely more than thermal machines.
Savings can be made by switching to plain paper ones 'in the right
application', says Andrew James, consultant at BIS Strategic Decision - that
is, where lots of faxes need to be photocopied if a thermal fax machine is
used. Taking secretarial costs and paper into account, Fischer reckons that
it costs 60p to copy each document.
Steve Robinson, marketing manager for fax at Rank Xerox, believes that when
the 1m thermal fax machines bought in the UK over the past four years are
replaced, they will be ousted by plain paper machines. Such optimism is
borne out by Dataquest, the IT research consultancy. 'The middle market of
the high-end thermal machines has been killed off,' says industry analyst
Jeffrey Goldberg.
Whereas 1992 saw the predomination of laser fax machines, which use laser
printers to print out the document, Goldberg believes 1993 will be the year
for inkjet fax machines, where tiny dots of ink are squirted on to the
paper. Inkjet technology is cheaper than laser equipment, but each sheet
received works out to be more expensive.
Other types of machines can produce greater savings, even if many of those
are difficult to quantify. A fax card, fitted into the back of a PC, costs
about Pounds 600 but enables the user to send a fax directly from the PC.
There is no need to print out the document or hover over the fax machine to
ensure it is sent.
Offices with larger PC networks can give users access to fax technology at
their desktop. Some systems need an operator to guide each incoming fax to
the correct recipient but others attach a code to the fax number to identify
the individual PC.
One of the basic requirements for fax switch user CT Bowring was to have a
centralised number for all faxes to prevent outsiders having to learn up to
60 different ones - for marine, aviation and so on. But many additional
management controls have resulted.
The fax switch logs and saves all messages for two weeks, so that if a fax
is mislaid a copy can be made. After two weeks all messages are copied on to
optical disc and stored for 10 years.
'We have installed everything from mainframes to complicated PABXs. But the
thanks and praise we got for installing the fax switch were out of all
proportion,' reports Lim. The quality of the final fax, he believes, is what
really impresses CT Bowring employees.
Other advantages accrue. 'Fax switches cut down maintenance costs
dramatically and greatly reduce the cost of consumables (paper, toner),'
reports Rank Xerox's Robinson.
However, for many companies the stand-alone fax is still the only answer. 'I
think we're a long way from the one PC per desk scenario, and until then
there will still be a need for stand-alone faxes,' points out Graham
MacIntyre, fax marketing manager at Canon.
However, recognising that companies need centralised control of their fax
machines in order to cut costs, manufacturers are looking at ways of
controlling the desk-top machines centrally, says Keith Wright, national fax
sales manager at Panasonic Business Systems.
Within the next 18 months, electronic wizardry will be available to filter
out all outgoing faxes to popular locations - from the London office of a
big corporation to the New York office, for example. They will then be
stored and sent at off-peak times. 'What happens at the moment is that these
documents are sent at peak times and there's no one there to see them
anyway,' says Wright.
As well as using off-peak transmission times this service would cut down the
length of the call because the 'handshake', which takes up valuable time at
the beginning and the end of a call, would only be transmitted once. The
calls could also be routed via cheaper data lines, or faxes could be sent
via another office - from London to San Francisco via New York - if cheaper
lines could be used.
Such centralised systems would greatly reduce the need for training - for
many companies training today is minimal. As Fischer puts it: 'Most of the
time training is left to the person who sits nearest to the machine.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The sound of cheap
CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK's national heritage select committee begins hearings today on the
high price of compact discs, one Hong Kong-based company continues to sell
CDs at less than half the price of the large groups while claiming to be
twice as profitable.
Naxos, an independent classical label, says it sold 5m CDs worldwide last
year for about Pounds 4.99 each. Although there is a wide range of prices in
the UK, CDs featuring well-known performers can sell for nearly three times
the Naxos price.
Klaus Heymann, Naxos's founder and owner, says the secret of cheaper CDs
does not lie in reducing manufacturing costs. Although the company has its
headquarters in Hong Kong, it manufactures in Germany, Japan and the US.
Heymann says to reduce costs by manufacturing in lower-wage countries would
hurt Naxos's sales in Asia. 'The south-east Asian market will only buy CDs
made in places like Japan and Europe - preferably Germany,' he says. It
costs 80p to manufacture a CD, even in Japan and Germany. As the large music
companies never tire of pointing out, manufacturing is a small part of the
cost of producing a CD.
Heymann says he has some advantages over large companies when it comes to
manufacturing. The company owns no factories. It contracts out all its
manufacturing. Its repertoire is classical rather than popular, so that
demand is more predictable.
But Heymann says he makes savings elsewhere. He does not use well-known
performers such as Luciano Pavarotti and Herbert von Karajan. Instead he
searches for artists who are keen to reach a wider public. Naxos orchestras
include the UK's Northern Chamber Orchestra and the Budapest Symphony. Naxos
performers are paid a flat fee rather than royalties.
Naxos, unlike the large record companies, does not produce more than one
version of any particular piece of music.
With staff of only eight people in Hong Kong, Heymann estimates his overhead
costs are 5p for each CD sold, compared, he says, with more than Pounds 1
for the large companies.
He sells his CDs to distributors around the world for Pounds 1.70 each. They
sell them to retailers for an average of Pounds 2.78.
Heymann says that his net profit margin on sales of Dollars 20m (Pounds
13.2m) last year was 25-30 per cent.
Given public demand for well-known names and orchestras, many of Naxos's
cost-savings could not be replicated by the large companies. But Heymann
believes the big producers could still cut costs if they were less
profligate. Naxos has no champagne signing ceremonies, he says.
'I'm not critical of the majors because of their prices,' he says. 'With the
way they operate, they need those prices. I'm critical of the way they
operate. Paying an artist a Pounds 50,000 advance for a recording that will
sell 10,000 copies is crazy.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Catering for the
ethical shopper / A look at a growing consumer trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICOLE DICKENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have long responded to green consciousness by making concern for
the environment an important business objective. But a growing number of
consumers claim to base their purchasing decisions on a much wider range of
ethical issues.
David Grayson, managing director of the business strategy group at Business
in the Community, uses the term vigilante consumer, coined by US
trend-spotter Faith Popcorn, to describe consumers who are not just
interested in the products or services they buy but the behaviour of the
company behind the brand and the way the product or service is developed.
Vigilante consumers are a powerful force in the US, where the Council of
Economic Priorities, a consumer group, has sold over 4m copies of its
booklet Shopping For a Better World. This lists companies which have scored
top marks on their record on issues ranging from animal testing to links
with South Africa. The UK edition launched by the publishing house New
Consumer in September 1991 has sold just 7,662 copies. But Grayson asserts
that these consumers are a growing and vocal minority. A Mori survey showed
that the number of consumers who rated a company's activities in the
community as very important has grown from 33 per cent in 1991 to 35 per
cent in 1992.
Sceptics say there are already signs that the prolonged recession has
blunted the impact of green consumers. But proponents of the vigilante
consumer argument maintain that ethical concerns will become integral to
corporate decision-making in the 1990s.
Grand Metropolitan has long taken the view that corporate ethics affect
consumers' purchasing decisions. Its public policy issues scan system in the
US - a forward-looking data base of consumer concerns - tracks a wide range
of issues that go beyond the food and drink industry. The most pertinent
issues that are likely to arise in the next three to five years are sent to
Grand Met's operating companies to assess their likely impact. Managers then
decide whether to change policy, lobby government or direct efforts into
re-educating the public.
Raymond Krause, senior vice-president of government and community affairs at
Grand Met, believes the company's system is more sophisticated than its
rivals. It is also expensive - updating the data every three years can cost
Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) - but Krause claims there is a tangible benefit.
He points to Grand Met subsidiary Green Giant which identified in 1989 that
the use of CFCs in freezing vegetables was a legitimate issue of public
concern. It began phasing them out that year before individual states
imposed taxes on their use and public concern reached fever pitch.
Levi Strauss, the jeans manufacturer, believes companies must scrutinise
their business practices and those of their suppliers, retailers and
business partners. Last year Levi issued global sourcing guidelines setting
out new terms of engagement with suppliers and retailers, excluding those
operating in countries with 'oppressive' regimes.
The same principle is being tentatively taken up by Premier Beverages, a
division of Premier Brands. Last year the company became aware of growing
public and staff concern over the employment policies of its tea suppliers.
In February Premier Beverages launched its fair trade initiative of
selecting plantations on social and environmental criteria and placed the
'Caring for tea and our tea pickers' logo on all Typhoo tea packaging.
Dragon International, a London-based marketing design consultancy, says
consumers are often unaware of companies' ethical policies, and that
responsible companies can benefit from promoting their good deeds.
Last December, Timberland, the shoe manufacturer, ran an advertising
campaign against racism in the US and Germany in partnership with charitable
bodies. In the US, Timberland linked up with Boston-based organisation City
Year which is campaigning for the public to help regenerate inner cities.
The press ads did not just publicise Timberland's stance on racism but
encouraged consumer support for the City Year project. It set up a phone
line manned by employees and received 300-500 calls a week.
Companies which have been the target of consumer boycotts are increasingly
on the defensive. Nestle has been the target of a long-running campaign by
the International Baby Food Action Network over its practice of promoting
bottle feeding in the developing world. Although Nestle says the campaign
has not had a discernible impact on UK sales, figures from market research
organisation Nielsen show that Nescafe's share of the instant coffee market
dipped to 40 per cent in 1992 from 41 per cent in 1991 when the Church of
England Synod lent its voice to the boycott.

FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The man who would
make kings - A campaign to sell royalty to the Brazilians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helio Bloch is a kingmaker. Not, he hastens to explain, in the metaphorical
sense used for US political consultants with presidents to sell, but with a
real throne in his sights.
Next Wednesday Brazilians will vote in a plebiscite on whether to restore
the monarchy. Bloch, from the Rio-based Meet advertising agency, is in
charge of mustering the support of those disenchanted with the 104-year-old
republic. 'It's the first time this century that anyone has tried to sell a
real king,' he says.
The plebiscite, in which Brazilians must also vote on whether to change the
current presidential system to a parliamentary model, is breathing life into
Brazil's recession-hit advertising industry, with three leading agencies
masterminding campaigns.
Every night for the last two months monarchists, presidentialists and
parliamentarians have been trying to sell their wares in a fixed 20-minute
slot of free airtime to Brazil's 85m voters.
The task for their creators is more challenging than most advertising
campaigns, even of a political nature, because they are not marketing a
product but a concept, one that is hard to grasp by a largely uneducated
population.
Bloch explains: 'This is very different to traditional political campaigns
where one is simply selling a new face or new platform for a party already
established in the public mind. In the UK, for example, John Major could be
sold as the new face of Conservatism without having to explain what being a
Conservative means. I'm having to sell a whole new idea.'
Although latest polls show the monarchists registering only 17 per cent of
the vote, Bloch is confident. His main selling point is the success of
monarchy in modern world, using Spain and Japan as examples.
Brazil's history also plays an important part in Bloch's attempts to
'establish the credentials of monarchy'. 'Brazilians have a very good image
of the last Emperor Dom Pedro II,' he says. 'He paid his own bills, the
country had total liberty of speech and was very advanced with amongst the
world's first railways and telephone systems.'
Bloch's third weapon is what he calls the 'collective subconscious'. He
explains: 'Everything good in Brazil is royal, thus Pele is known as king of
football, Roberto Carlos (a top singer) is the king of music and Xuxa (the
leading children's presenter) is the queen of children.'
With less than Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) at his disposal, Bloch elected to
spend most of the money on short commercials, concentrating on these three
points. Under the slogan 'Help Brazil recover its majesty', recurring themes
in these commercials are the absence of inflation and corruption during
Brazil's 67-year-period as a monarchy compared with today's rapid inflation
and rampant bribery.
Despite Bloch's well-acclaimed campaign, the republicans are far ahead.
Surprisingly, support for presidentialism has not been dented by the
corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of President Fernando
Collor.
Sergio Amado from Denison, the Sao Paulo-based agency running the campaign,
uses the national anthem and footage of important mass protests of the past
to come over as the more patriotic choice. He uses the Collor scandal as a
benefit of the system: 'We decided we must confront the issue so we used the
theme 'You the people elected him and you the people took him away'.'
With more than Dollars 5m to spend, Amado hopes to get seven out of 10
votes, partly through attacks on the other systems, attacking the monarchy
for slavery and blaming the disastrous experience of parliamentarianism in
1962-63 - when the country had three prime ministers in one year - for the
subsequent military coup.
The big loser is parliamentarianism with a didactic campaign involving too
many talking heads trying to explain the concept of parliamentarism and
division of powers to a largely illiterate population. So desperate are the
parliamentarians that they are offering voters the chance of another
referendum after five years.

FT  15 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Profession opts for primacy of public
interest - Andrew Colquhoun explains moves to define a regulatory body's
future role in a fast-changing world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW COLQUHOUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent publication of the first ever mission statement from the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales highlights our
primary commitment to the public interest above narrower members' interests.
Production of the statement, together with core objectives and policy
priorities for the next 3-5 years, was the culmination of an 18-month debate
about the institute's future role.
This debate has obliged the institute's council and the membership to remind
themselves of the reasons why the Empress of India gave Royal Charters to
private bodies like the institute: as the best available means for serving
the public interest in areas where government expertise was limited, rather
than primarily to further the narrow self-interests of their members.
In the intervening period, and particularly in the last 20 years, the
accountancy profession has grown dramatically in size and complexity. As a
consequence, it is totally legitimate for observers to ask whether the
institute (and its fellow professional bodies) has the ability and the
resources effectively to regulate multinational firms with global revenues
in billions of dollars.
There is nothing predetermined which says the structures that served a
social purpose in the regulation of accountancy in an earlier age are
necessarily going to be relevant and effective in the last years of the
twentieth century.
If members of professional bodies like the institute are to retain their
rights and privileges (not least to benefit from the market premium
associated with being a chartered accountant), then they must ensure that
the social radar of their body is tuned to pick up changes in public
expectations and that effective policies follow promptly.
That is why in its planning framework document, the institute's council has
given primacy to the public interest. The council has explicitly restated a
fundamental and enduring tenet: that it will not adopt or support policies
that run counter to the public interest. But it also made an equally
fundamental judgment: that there is a natural convergence over the longer
term between the public interest and the interests of the institute's
membership as a whole.
The key phrases here are 'over the longer term' and the 'membership as a
whole'. In the short term, it is quite possible that the professional bodies
should, and will, take decisions which have an adverse short-term impact on
the commercial activities of some members. For example, the immediate effect
of the tough ethical guidance on specialist valuations from the Chartered
Accountants Joint Ethics Committee (Cajec) will be to reduce the fee income
of some firms.
But Cajec had analysed the issue critically, had consulted widely inside and
outside the profession, and formulated its view accordingly. The three
member bodies believed that this was a necessary step to take in order to
strengthen the independence of the auditor, and thereby enhance the
long-term reputation of the profession as a whole.
Some institute members, particularly from small firms, have asked a
different, but equally legitimate, question: 'If the institute is primarily
motivated by long-term, public interest issues, how are the more immediate
private interests of the members to be furthered?' Or to put the question
more simply: 'Can the regulator also represent and serve the members?'
In answer to this question, the council would argue that policies which
serve the public also serve the members over the longer term. It would also
distinguish between the locus for decisions. In certain areas, the institute
and its committees are the ultimate decision-makers. This applies to
individual disciplinary and regulatory cases and at a corporate level to the
formulation of disciplinary policy, ethical guidance and audit regulation.
In taking these decisions, it would be fundamentally wrong for the institute
to take anything other than an enlightened approach to the public interest.
More to the point, it would be dangerous and unsustainable, because the
government or the courts would either force self-interested decisions to be
overturned or, ultimately, would strip the institute of its decision-making
powers.
In other areas, the institute and the other professional bodies are not the
final decision-makers, but have the ability to make representations to those
who are. Here, for example, the decision-makers are the Department of Trade
and Industry, the Accounting Standards Board, the tax authorities, or the
Securities and Investments Board.
It is an entirely proper role for professional bodies to bring the direct
experience of their members to bear in the representations which it makes to
those external decision-makers. Indeed, it would be strange, if not
undesirable, if the views of the professions, as the greatest repositories
of expertise in certain areas, were not expressed effectively.
In a pluralist society, those decision-makers will be exposed to a whole
range of other views and will weigh them up accordingly. But the fact that
the institute has regulatory functions in certain areas does not mean it
need pull its punches in representing its views on related issues.
Some members of the profession would then pose a further question: 'If my
institute is also my regulator, how can I get help from it with an ethical
or regulatory problem without the institutes' Joint Monitoring Unit finding
out and knocking on my door to inspect what I am doing?'
One could argue that these fears are exaggerated, that the unit does not
work in that way, and that thousands of members are getting help of this
sort from the institute every year. Nevertheless, the concerns are real, and
are being addressed. For example, we are setting up a small firm support
service around the country to assist individual members who want to raise
their professional standards or who face ethical dilemmas.
We are also reviewing the application of a new bye-law which placed an
obligation on members to report professional misconduct. The principle of
this requirement is sound, but needs to be applied with sensitivity if it is
not to deter members facing ethical dilemmas from seeking the proper help.
Underlying these examples is the judgment that it must be fully consistent
with the institute's mission to assist individual members who want to raise
their professional standards or who face ethical dilemmas.
The institute's planning framework has provided it with a powerful tool. It
will assist in deciding how to allocate resources and in communicating with
members. More important, it will help to provide an enduring discipline by
which the institute can ensure that all its important decisions have given
the proper weight to the public interest, and thereby to the long-term
reputation of the profession.
This will not be enough on its own. The process of greater openness which
the council recently adopted for meetings should also help to convince
observers that professional regulation is being effectively discharged by
the institute. A more sensitive set of early warning radar for changes in
public expectations will also need to be spinning, for example for
disciplinary policy.
Taken together with the reform agenda for audit, financial reporting and
associated issues, these changes will help to ensure that the accountancy
profession keeps pace with the changing needs, both of the broader community
and of chartered accountants themselves, to the benefit of all.

Chartered Accountants in England and Wales

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Bill to implement Lamont's Budget
proposals - The Finance Bill was published yesterday.  The Treasury issued
the accompanying guidance, describing the intention of each of its 208
clauses and 23 schedules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR DUTIES
Clause 1 and Schedule 1 introduce new rates of duty on beer, wine, made-wine
and cider from 16 March 1993. The new rates of duty represent an increase of
5 per cent on the rates of duty previously charged. They also implement the
requirement of Article 20 of EC directive 92/83/EEC in respect of wine and
made-wine of an alcoholic strength exceeding 22 per cent by imposing a new
increased rate of Pounds 19.81 per litre of alcohol in the wine and
made-wine. *
Clause 2 provides for a new rate of duty for beer end product duty, when it
is introduced. It replaces the duty rate of Pounds 10.60 per hectolitre per
cent of alcohol in the beer (set by section 7(1) of the Finance Act 1991 for
the new system) with Pounds 10.45. *
Clause 3 extends the definition of beer without changing its duty liability.
The new definition of beer includes any liquor which is made or sold as beer
or as a substitute for beer and is of a strength exceeding 0.5 per cent
alcohol by volume. The previous definition had only included such drinks
that exceeded 1.2 per cent alcohol by volume. Beers exceeding 0.5 per cent
but not exceeding 1.2 per cent alcohol by volume will not be liable for
excise duty. *
Clause 4 and Schedule 23(1)(1) provides for the repeal and amendment of
certain sections of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 (ALDA), which allow
for the refund of excise duty in specified circumstances. Repeals a
requirement for brewers to produce certain records. *
Clause 5 and Schedule 23(1)(2) implement the requirements of the EC
directives on the holding and movement of products subject to excise duty
(92/12/EEC) and the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on
alcohol (92/83/EEC) by prohibiting the blending or mixing of two or more
alcoholic liquors outside of an excise warehouse or permitted premises,
except in specified circumstances. *
Clause 6 and Schedule 23(1)(3) implement a requirement of EC directive
92/83/EEC on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol
by increasing the quantity of spirit which may be mixed with wine in an
excise warehouse from six to 12 litres of alcohol and reducing the permitted
upper strength limit of the resultant mixture to 22 per cent alcohol by
volume. *
Clause 7 implements the requirements of Articles 8 and 12 of the EC
directive on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol
(92/83/EEC) by extending the definition of sparkling wine and made-wine in
Schedule 1 of ALDA. *
Clause 8 implements a requirement of Article 27.1.(a) of the EC directive on
the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol (92/83/EEC)
by extending the appropriate references to methylated spirits in ALDA to
include 'denatured alcohol'. *
HYDROCARBON OIL DUTIES
Clause 9 increases by 10 per cent the rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils
(including the rebates for certain oils) with effect from 6pm on 16 March
1993. *
Clause 10 applies hydrocarbon oil duty to mineral oil fuel substitutes, to
be designated by order, at the duty rate of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil
or road fuel gas. *
Clause 11 and Schedule 23(1)(4) introduce duty on other fuel substitutes,
chargeable when they are set aside for use as motor fuel or as an additive
or extender in motor fuel. *
Clauses 10 and 11 bring UK law into line with EC law, which provides a wider
definition of chargeable oils and extends duty to non-hydrocarbon fuel
substitutes. In both cases, chargeable substances will be designated by
order (to be made shortly after royal assent), and the duty rate applicable
will be that of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil or road fuel gas. The clauses
supersede existing provisions charging petrol substitutes and power
methylated spirits. *
Clause 12 and Schedule 23(1)(5) provide for excise duty to be charged on the
volume of oils corrected to a temperature of 15 degrees centigrade, and for
corresponding adjustments to duty rebates and refunds. This change is in
line with EC law. Regulations made under the clause will prescribe the
method of adjusting volume. The provisions will take effect on an appointed
day, expected to be in October 1993. *
TOBACCO PRODUCTS DUTY
Clause 13 amends the rates of duty on tobacco products with effect from 6pm
on 16 March 1993. *
Clause 14 amends the definition of hand-rolling tobacco for duty purposes,
in line with EC law. The borderline between hand-rolling tobacco and pipe
tobacco moves from a cut width of 0.6mm to 1.0mm; and for anti-avoidance
reasons other tobacco of a kind used for making cigarettes is brought within
the hand-rolling description. *
GAMING MACHINE LICENCE DUTY
Clause 15 increases by 20 per cent most rates of duty on gaming machines for
licences for any period beginning on or after 1 May 1993. Rates for 10p and
20p-play small-prize machines and 5p jackpot machines rise from Pounds 375
to Pounds 450; and rates for 10p and 20p-play jackpot machines rise from
Pounds 960 to Pounds 1,150. The clause makes no change to the Pounds 150
rate for 5p small-prize machines. *
Clause 16 abolishes the duty on 5p small-prize gaming machines for licences
for any period beginning on or after 1 November 1993. The clause makes
extensive consequential amendments to the Betting and Gaming Duties Act
1981, because small-prize machines will then be subject to only a single
rate of duty (on machines costing more than 5p per play), and because 5p
jackpot machines will remain liable to duty. *
VEHICLES EXCISE DUTY
Clause 17 raises the main VED rate for private and light-goods vehicles from
Pounds 110 to Pounds 125 (Section (7) (b)). The other sections raise the
related rates for motorbikes, taxis, some farmers' and showmen's vehicles,
and vintage private and light goods vehicles in the same proportion, rounded
to the nearest Pounds 5. *
Clause 18 raises the duty for heavy goods vehicles which carry exceptional
loads in two stages, the first after 16 March 1993, to Pounds 4,250, and the
second from a day which the secretary of state appoints. The intention is to
raise the tax rate to Pounds 5,000 from the date of the first unified
Budget.
Clause 19 links duty for trade plates for motorcycles, and for all other
vehicles to the main duty rates for cars and motorcycles respectively. Trade
plates duty will thus change automatically when these main rates change in
future.
Clause 20 puts duty treatment of vintage (pre-1933) motorbikes on same basis
as that of vintage (pre-1947) cars by dropping the engine capacity and
weight restrictions. Around 1,000 vintage motorbikes will pay only Pounds 15
duty (previously Pounds 30).
Clause 21 provides powers to modify the current complex lorry VED
legislation so as to simplify its presentation. An order will be published
after royal assent showing the new presentational structure.
Rates for farmers' and showmens' lorries will be expressed as multipliers of
main lorry rates, thereby obviating the need to produce several similar
tables of rates. The clause does not permit any rate to be increased by the
new order.
MISCELLANEOUS DUTIES
Clause 22 implements sections of EC directives 92/108/EEC and 92/12/EEC. In
common with the other member states of the EC, the UK is introducing
measures to extend to excise duties the provisions for mutual recovery of
VAT debts, and for mutual assistance through the disclosure of information
for VAT. *
Clause 23 enables the secretary of state for transport to refuse to issue a
vehicle excise licence for an unregistered vehicle which has been brought
into the UK unless he is satisfied that any VAT and customs duty due on the
vehicle has been or will be paid or remitted. *
LOTTERY DUTY
Clause 24 introduces a new excise duty on lotteries, primarily intended to
cover the National Lottery due to start in 1994. The clause establishes the
normal chargeable event as the sale in the UK of a lottery ticket or chance;
excludes bingo from the duty; and exempts existing lawful lotteries run for
the benefit of charities, local authorities etc.*
Clause 25 sets the rate of duty at 12 per cent of the gross stake.
Clause 26 enables regulations to be made for deferred payment of duty, and
for advance payments on account.
Clause 27 provides for duty payment by the lottery promoter, or under
regulations by another responsible person (for the National Lottery this
will be the main licensee). It also provides for recovery of unpaid duty;
and creates a summary offence for failure to pay.
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Clause 28 gives responsibility for the care and management of the duty to
the commissioners of Customs and Excise and provides for administrative
regulations, and penalties for their breach.
Clause 29 defines the chargeable person (for the National Lottery this will
be the main licensee) and requires them to register; provides for
regulations on registration; and creates an indictable offence for running a
dutiable lottery while unregistered.
Clause 30 applies the 'revenue trade' provisions of the Customs and Excise
Management Act 1979, which include the power to estimate duty due and the
obligation on traders to keep and preserve records.
Clause 31 creates indictable offences for fraudulent evasion of lottery duty
and false declarations.
Clause 32 extends the offence provisions to directors and similar officers
of bodies corporate that commit offences.
Clause 33 provides for forfeiture of any goods involved in fraudulent
evasion.
Clause 34 provides immunity from lottery offences for any person acting on
the instructions of the commissioners.
Clause 35 provides for evidence, by certificate of the commissioners,
concerning registration, returns and payments.
Clause 36 makes lottery duty a preferential debt in insolvency.
Clause 37 provides for disclosure of information between the commissioners,
the Gaming Board and the secretary of state (and through him, the
director-general of the National Lottery).
Clause 38 permits regulations and orders to be made by statutory instrument.
Clause 39 excludes lotteries from the scope of pool betting duty.
Clause 40 contains definitions; applies the lottery duty provisions of the
Act to lotteries promoted on behalf of the Crown; and ensures that the
imposition of duty on an unlawful lottery does not legitimise the activity.
Clause 41 provides for commencement orders (the provisions are likely to
come into effect in late 1993).
Schedule 23(1)(7) makes consequential repeals.
VALUE ADDED TAX
Clause 42 and Schedule 23(II)(1) provide that supplies of fuel and power for
domestic, residential and charity non-business use shall cease to be
zero-rated for VAT.
The clause also provides that from 1 April 1994 the rate of VAT applying to
such supplies shall be 8 per cent and that from 1 April 1995 the standard
rate shall apply. *
Clause 43 and Schedule 23(II)(2) abolish the discount for high business
mileage in the fixed scales used for charging VAT on fuel supplied for
private mileage in business cars. It ensures that the VAT scales remain the
same as the income tax scales for taxing fuel as a benefit in kind. *
Clause 44 and Schedule 23(II)(3) allow the second supply of goods in a
triangular transaction by a supplier belonging in an intermediate member
state, and the supply of goods installed or assembled in the UK by a
supplier belonging in another member state, to be treated as an acquisition
by the UK customer, thereby relieving the supplier of the need to register
for VAT in the UK. *
Clause 45 prevents fraud, by stipulating that a standard rated supply of
gold will be treated as a taxable supply by the buyer as well as by the
seller for the purposes of registration for VAT, and that the buyer must
account to Customs and Excise for the output tax on behalf of the supplier.
It also allows, by order, extension of this special system to other
specified goods, and services related to these goods. *
Clause 46 amends the provisions covering appeals to the Value Added Tax
tribunal concerning input tax recovery. It makes provision that such appeals
are to succeed only if the commissioners have acted unreasonably in refusing
tax recovery. *
Clause 47 changes the circumstances where the gift of a sample does not give
rise to a supply for VAT purposes. It also expressly provides that where a
number of identical or substantially similar items are given as samples to
the same person, only one of the items is deemed not to be supplied.
It ensures that no output tax charge arises in respect of business assets
which are put to a private or other non-business use, unless the taxpayer
has been entitled to prior deduction of input tax in respect of them. *
Clause 48 reduces the qualifying waiting period for VAT bad debt relief to
six months. *
Clause 49 and Schedule 2 (consequential repeals are listed in Schedule
23(II)(4)).
Misdeclaration penalty under section 14 of the 1985 Act (paragraph 1 of
Schedule) revises the base and yard sticks against which a single
misdeclaration made on a VAT return is measured. A new flexible penalty base
capable of adjustment for misdeclarations and voluntary disclosures is
introduced. It uses the total tax managed by the business (eg total VAT on
purchases plus total VAT on sales in the period) instead of the net tax
payable under the current arrangements. It provides for the commencement of
the paragraph by Treasury order. *
Misdeclaration penalty under section 14A of the 1985 Act (paragraph 2 of
Schedule) revises the base against which repeated misdeclarations made on a
VAT return are measured. It also outlines the criteria which must be
fulfilled before a penalty for repeated misdeclarations can be activated. It
provides for a penalty of 15 per cent of the tax that would have been lost
in the period that is subject to a penalty. The penalty base for repeated
misdeclarations is the same as that to be used for single misdeclarations -
the total tax managed by the business. It provides for commencement by
Treasury order and termination of any outstanding penalty liability notices
issued under the current regime. *
Mitigation of penalties (paragraph 3 of Schedule) outlines how Customs and
the VAT tribunals are to mitigate penalties under the Finance Act 1985. It
also entitles VAT tribunals to restore a penalty reduced by Customs. It
defines those matters which are not to be taken into account in determining
the level of mitigation*.
Interest on tax etc. recovered or recoverable by assessment (paragraph 4 of
Schedule) amends the circumstances in which interest on underdeclared VAT is
to be assessed. Interest is normally payable back to the date of the
introduction of interest in April 1990 or to a later date if the
misdeclaration was subsequent to it. The effect of this paragraph is to
limit the interest liability to the latest three years only, where this
period would otherwise have been exceeded. It provides for commencement of
the paragraph by Treasury order. *
Default surcharge (paragraphs 5-7 of Schedule) provides from 1 October 1993,
for the issue of a surcharge liability notice when a person first defaults
on either furnishing a VAT return or paying the tax due; makes a person
liable to surcharge in respect of the next payment default for an accounting
period; removes the liability to surcharge where a person is in default for
an accounting period but there is no tax outstanding for that period;
provides for the rate of surcharge to increase only where there is a payment
default; and introduces a new first rate of surcharge at 2 per cent.
Surcharge assessments at the two lower rates will not be issued unless they
are for Pounds 200 or more.
Also reduces from 1 April 1993 the highest rate of surcharge from 20 per
cent to 15 per cent. *
Clause 50 and Schedule 23(II)(5) amend the Value Added Tax Act 1983 by
deleting three references concerning the valuation and collection of car tax
due on chargeable vehicles brought to the UK from other EC countries,
following the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993. Since car
tax was abolished on 12 November 1992, the legislation was never needed.
INCOME TAX CHARGE, RATES AND ALLOWANCES
Clause 51 reimposes income tax for 1993-94 with the same rates as in
1992-93. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged, at Pounds 23,700 of
taxable income, but the lower rate band is increased by Pounds 500, to
Pounds 2,500 of taxable income. *
Clause 52 sets the personal and married couples' allowances for 1993-94 at
the same level as for 1992-93. The additional personal allowance (mainly for
single parents) and the widows' bereavement allowance, which are linked to
the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65, are also unchanged.
*
CORPORATION TAX CHARGE AND RATE
Clause 53 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1993
at 33 per cent.
Clause 54 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the
financial year 1993 at 25 per cent. It also sets, at one fiftieth, the
fraction used in calculating the marginal rate (currently 35 per cent) for
companies with profits in a band above that to which the small companies'
rate applies.
INTEREST: GENERAL
Clause 55 sets the limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief at
Pounds 30,000 for 1993-94 (the same as for 1992-93). The clause will have
effect from 6 April 1993. *
Clause 56 gives entitlement to mortgage interest relief on a loan originally
used to buy a borrower's old home as though the loan had been used to buy a
new home if, when the borrower moves, the new home is substituted for the
old home as security for the loan. The clause will have effect from 16 March
1993. *
Clause 57 gives entitlement to mortgage interest relief where a borrower
leaves his home. Where the property is put up for sale, interest relief will
be available on a loan used to buy it, or on a loan to an elderly person
used to buy a life annuity, for up to 12 months after the property has
ceased to be the borrower's only or main residence. In the case of a home
purchase loan, the clause replaces rules that required the borrower to take
out a loan to buy a new home. The clause will have effect from 16 March
1993. *
Clause 58 introduces specific powers for the Inland Revenue to recover
amounts overclaimed by lenders operating the Miras (mortgage interest relief
at source) scheme. *
Clause 59 makes a technical amendment to the tax deduction at source rules
to ensure that all UK deposit-takers can pay interest without deduction of
tax to people who are not ordinarily resident in the UK and who have made a
declaration to that effect. An Inland Revenue press release was issued on 21
January 1993.
Clause 60 provides for extension of the circumstances in which the taxes
acts prevent a deduction from profits for loan interest that exceeds a
commercial rate of return.
This is linked to the new rules on foreign exchange gain and losses (Clauses
122-167 below). The clause will apply where a loan advanced in one currency
is repayable by reference to another currency, and the interest charged is
excessive by reference to the amount repayable. *
INTEREST ETC. ON DEBTS BETWEEN ASSOCIATED COMPANIES
Clause 61 begins a set of provisions which provide that interest (or
equivalent return) payable within multinational groups to UK resident
companies on certain loans made by UK resident companies will be taxable as
it accrues rather than when it is paid and will apply to all interest
accruing from midnight on 31 March 1993. The clause sets out the conditions
(including in particular the relationships necessary between relevant
parties) which if satisfied mean that a debt may become a qualifying debt
and be subject to the provisions of the proposed legislation. *
Clause 62 details various conditions, relating primarily to the terms of the
debt, which if satisfied may exempt a debt from these proposals. If interest
is payable at intervals of 12 months or less, bears a constant fixed
relationship to a standard published rate or published index of prices and
the debt is either redeemed within 12 months of its creation or the amount
payable on redemption (excluding interest) does not exceed the consideration
given for it, then the debt will be exempt from these provisions.
Alternatively, if it can be shown to the inspector's satisfaction that the
charging to tax of interest on an arising as opposed to on an accrual basis
was not a main motive for the arrangements and that those terms would have
been agreed on an arm's-length basis, the debt may also be exempted. *
Clause 63 sets out provisions which will apply to qualifying debts which
have the characteristics of debts on accrued income securities. By reference
to the provisions of the accrued income scheme (Sections 710 to 728 of the
Taxes Act 1988) it establishes both a time and a method for determining the
quantum of chargeable income deemed to arise in relation to such debts. *
Clause 64 similarly sets out a time and a method for determining, by
reference to Schedule 4 to the Taxes Act 1988 (deep discount securities),
the chargeable income that will be deemed to arise in respect of qualifying
debts which have the characteristics of deep discount securities. *
Clause 65 details the provisions which will apply to those qualifying debts
having the characteristics of debts on deep gain securities, determining the
chargeable income that will be deemed to arise by reference to the
provisions of Schedule 11 to the Finance Act 1989 (deep gain securities). *
Clause 66 introduces measures to avoid any double charging which could
result from the interaction of these provisions with existing arrangements
relating to accrued income securities, deep discount securities and deep
gain securities. *
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
Clause 67 reduces from Pounds 400 to Pounds 250 the minimum limit for
charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Gift Aid scheme,
from 16 March 1993. *
Clause 68 increases from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900 the annual limit for
charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Payroll Giving
Scheme, from 6 April 1993. *
Clause 69 gives relief for an employer's voluntary contributions to a
charitable agency's costs of running the employer's payroll giving scheme
when calculating the employer's business profits for tax purposes. An Inland
Revenue extra-statutory concession currently ensures tax relief in these
circumstances.
The statutory relief applies to expenditure incurred on or after 16 March
1993. The extra-statutory concession continues to cover expenditure up to
that date. *
BENEFITS IN KIND
Clause 70 sets the car benefit scale charges for 1993-94. *
Clause 71 sets for 1993-94 the scales for assessing the benefit of fuel
provided by employers for private use in company cars and removes for
1993-94 and subsequent years the reduction in the charge for 18,000 or more
business miles a year. *
Clause 72 and Schedule 3 replace the car benefit scale charges by a new
measure of the benefit of a car available for private use. This is 35 per
cent of the price of the car, with discounts for business mileage and for
older cars. The price of the car is defined as its published list price if
it has one or, if not, the notional price which would have been published as
the list price for the car. The price of the car is increased for
accessories provided when the car was first made available. The price of
certain classic cars is their market value. *
Clause 73 and Schedule 4 replace the existing rules for taxing employees'
private use of a company van with a flat rate scale charge of Pounds 500
(Pounds 350 for vans which are four or more years old) on which employees
will pay tax. The schedule contains provisions for allocating Pounds 500 (or
Pounds 350) per van among employees who share a van or a number of vans.
Employees sharing a van will be able to opt to pay tax on Pounds 5 a day for
each day on which they use a shared van. These new arrangements are to come
into effect on 6 April 1993. Inland Revenue press releases * and 14 April
1993.
Clause 74 exempts from tax from 6 April 1993 the benefit employees have from
commercial vehicles weighing more than 3,500 kilogrammes unless the vehicle
is used wholly or mainly for the employee's private purposes. *
Clause 75 exempts in-house sports and recreational facilities from tax as a
benefit in kind. It exempts facilities provided by employers generally. The
exemption is to take effect from 6 April 1993. *
Clause 76 and Schedule 5 introduce an exemption for removal expenses and
benefits paid on behalf of, reimbursed to or provided for employees who are
obliged to relocate with their job or in order to start a new job. The
exemption is limited to Pounds 8,000 and applies to payments made and
benefits provided before the end of the tax year following the year in which
the job is changed or the new job started. The Treasury are given the power
to increase the limit by order.
Employees are not required to dispose of their existing homes to qualify for
exemption. The types of payments and benefits eligible for relief are set
out in the Schedule.
The Treasury are given the power to amend by regulation the types of
payments and benefits which can be eligible for relief. The exemption is
available to employees who start their job at a new location after 5 April
1993. Inland Revenue press releases * and 14 April 1993.
TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS
Clause 77 reduces the income tax charge on dividends (for dividends paid
after 5 April 1993) from the basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of
20 per cent, and brings in an ordering rule so that dividends are treated as
the top part of a taxpayer's income, so that higher-rate taxpayers continue
to be liable to tax at the higher rate of 40 per cent on dividends above the
basic rate limit. These changes will also apply to foreign dividends and
stock dividends (shares received as an alternative to a cash dividend).
Clause 78 sets the rate of advance corporation tax (ACT) for distributions
made after 5 April 1993 and before 6 April 1994 at 22.5 per cent of the
value of the distribution and the ACT payable on it. It provides for the
rate subsequently to be linked to the lower rate of income tax. It also
provides for the value of the tax credit accompanying a distribution to be
reduced from 25 per cent of the value of the distribution and the tax credit
to 20 per cent for distributions made after 5 April 1993.
Clause 79 provides that charities which receive dividends from UK companies
and are entitled to claim payment of the accompanying tax credit will also
be entitled to claim special payments on a sliding scale for a transitional
period of four years from 1993-94. The special payments will ease the
transition to the new reduced value of the tax credit. *
Clause 80 and Schedule 6 make consequential amendments to existing
legislation to take account of the changes in the taxation of distributions.
Clause 81 stops a company from carrying back ACT to set against corporation
tax liabilities of an earlier period in some circumstances when the
ownership of a company changes. It applies to changes of ownership on or
after 16 March 1993.
CHARGEABLE GAINS
Clause 82 provides for the annual exempt amount for 1993-94 to be held at
Pounds 5,800: the annual exempt amount for most trustees will be Pounds
2,900. *
Clause 83 provides for the base month for indexation of the CGT annual
exempt amount to be changed from December to September with effect from
1994-95. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget.
Clause 84 prevents capital gains falling out of charge where shares are
exchanged for certain debentures which are outside the capital gains charge.
It applies to exchanges on or after 16 March 1993. *
Clause 85 enables regulations to be made to modify the capital gains tax
rules when people subscribe to a PEP by transferring newly issued shares, or
shares emerging from an approved all-employee share scheme, into the PEP.
The regulations, to be made shortly after royal assent, will apply where the
shares transferred form part of a larger portfolio. They will make clear
that the transfer does not affect the computation of future gains on shares
which remain outside the PEP. *
Clause 86 adds two new EC agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow
premium to the list of assets which qualify for capital gains tax rollover
relief with effect from 1 January 1993. It also creates a new power for
further assets to be added to the list of qualifying assets by Treasury
order.
Clause 87 and Schedule 7 introduce a new relief which allows capital gains
tax to be deferred where shares in an unquoted trading company are sold and
the gains are re-invested in other qualifying unquoted trading companies.
They also relax the qualifying conditions for capital gains tax retirement
relief. The shareholding condition is reduced from (broadly) 25 per cent
down to 5 per cent and some full time working employees are brought into the
relief (previously restricted to directors). These measures will apply to
disposals on or after 16 March 1993. *
Clause 88 and Schedule 8 restrict the set-off of capital losses brought into
a group of companies as a result of a company joining the group.
The restriction will apply to losses set off against gains arising on or
after 16 March 1993 where the losses came from a company which joined the
group on or after 31 March 1987.
The changes will end the practice of 'capital loss buying' where by capital
losses are bought in from other companies which have nothing to do with the
purchasing group's own activities and where the purchasing group does not
suffer the economic loss involved.*
Clause 89 allows a de-grouping charge which arises when a company leaves a
group with assets on which there is a deferred charge to be treated as
arising at the beginning of the accounting period in which the company left
the group. It applies for accounting periods ending on or after 1 October
1993.
Clause 90 corrects an error that arose on the consolidation of the capital
gains legislation in 1992. It will permit the special capital gains rules
about the transfers of UK insurance business to operate as they did before
consolidation if a non-resident company is involved. (Inland Revenue press
release 17 July 1992.)
Clause 91 defers the starting date for the charge on annual deemed disposals
by life assurance companies of holdings in unit trusts etc. The charge will
now apply to periods beginning on or after 1 January 1993. It amends the
transitional provisions under which assets otherwise caught by the charge
can be exchanged without immediate tax consequences for other assets. It
also amends the relief for assets which were held as backing for investment
linked business on 1 April 1990. Inland Revenue press release 30 December
1992.
CORPORATION TAX: CURRENCY
Clause 92 contains the basic rules that a company's trading profits or
losses are to be computed and expressed in sterling for tax purposes. This
clause and clauses 93-96 are linked to the new rules on foreign exchange
gains and losses (at Clauses 122-167 below). *
Clause 93 enables regulations to be made to allow the profits or losses of a
trade to be computed and expressed in a currency other than sterling in
certain circumstances. *
Clause 94 allows currencies other than sterling to be used in computing and
expressing the profits or losses of different parts of a trade in certain
circumstances. *
Clause 95 sets out how regulations on using a non-sterling currency for
computing profits and losses are to be made and what they can include, and
gives some related definitions. *
Clause 96 extends the use of currencies other than sterling for computing
trading profits or losses to the controlled foreign company legislation
which imposes UK tax on UK companies that control foreign companies in
low-tax areas. *
OVERSEAS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES
Clause 97 and Schedule 9 amend, in the case of UK branches of overseas life
companies, various provisions affecting their liability to corporation tax.
They will be modelled more closely on the provisions generally applying to
UK branches, but with special modifications which recognise the particular
features of life insurance business. Double tax relief will be available for
foreign tax paid on the income and gains arising on the life and other
long-term business of the UK branch. (Inland Revenue press release of 16
December 1992).
Clause 98 amends in the case of UK branches of overseas life companies the
rules according to which the assets of a life insurance company are
categorised for tax purposes.
The assets of the UK branch will be separated from other assets of the
company.
Clause 99 entitles overseas life companies to tax credits in respect of most
dividends from UK companies, where the income forms part of the life
assurance business of the UK branch.
Companies will also be able to make a claim to treat these distributions as
though they were profits chargeable to corporation tax and so set off
management expenses and various other deductions.
These provisions will apply for accounting periods beginning after 31
December 1992. Inland Revenue Press Release of 16 December 1992.
Clause 100 provides that in computing the UK branch income of overseas life
companies, the exemption from tax usually available to non-residents on
particular types of foreign source investment income is overridden.
Additionally, where income on Treasury securities which is free of tax to
residents abroad arises to the UK branch, the tax deductible management
expenses are restricted.
These provisions have effect for accounting periods beginning after 31
December 1992.
Clause 101 and Schedule 10 modify, in the case of UK branches of overseas
life companies, the special rules for calculating life insurance company
trading receipts, and the share of the profits attributable to the
policyholders. The modifications ensure that only the income and gains
related to the branch activities are taken into account and provide
alternative rules where the necessary figures are not available in returns
submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry. The changes take effect
for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992.
Clause 102 and Schedule 11 modify, in the case of UK branches of overseas
life companies, various provisions relating to the calculation of companies'
chargeable gains.
These modifications are consequential on the changes to the scope of the
charge on capital gains made under Clause 97 and on the changes in Clause 91
to the rules governing the deemed disposal of life insurance companies'
holdings of unit trusts.
They apply for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992.
Clause 103 changes the definition of an overseas life insurance company so
that it is tested according to where it is resident for tax purposes rather
than where its head office is situated.
The clause, which applies for accounting periods beginning after 31 December
1992, also repeals the provisions which are made redundant by the measures
in Clauses 97-102.
APPROVED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
Clause 104 provides that the amount of the capital gain on which a company
is chargeable to tax when it grants a share option to an employee under an
approved share scheme will, with effect from Budget day 1993, be the amount,
if any, actually paid for the option by the employee.*
Clause 105 prevents a double charge, to both income tax and capital gains
tax, arising in certain circumstances when an employee sells shares which he
received through a share option scheme set up by his employer. The clause
takes effect from 1 January 1992, Inland Revenue press release of 14 April.
INDEXATION: MISCELLANEOUS
Clause 106 maintains at Pounds 75,000 for 1993-94 the maximum level of
earnings for which pension provision may be made with tax relief. It
disapplies the indexation provisions which would otherwise have operated.*
Clause 107 provides for the base month for indexation of the main income tax
allowances, the basic and lower rate limits, and the earnings cap for
pensions to be changed from December to September with effect from 1994-95.
This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. The clause also
corrects a flaw in the indexation formula for the pensions earnings cap.
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ABOUT RELIEFS
Clause 108 provides an exemption from tax for outplacement services provided
to employees who lose their jobs.
It also ensures that employers paying for counselling services get a tax
deduction for their payments. The exemption is to take effect for employees
made redundant on or after 16 March 1993 or, for employees made redundant
before then, for services bought on or after 16 March 1993.*
Clause 109 extends from five years to seven the period for which businesses
can claim relief for revenue expenditure incurred before the start of
trading. It also brings within the scope of the relief certain expenditure
by companies which is treated as a 'charge on income'.
This applies mainly to interest paid other than to a bank operating in the
UK. These charges are not currently included in the category of expenditure
which qualifies for pre-trading relief.
The extended time limit applies to those who start to trade on or after 1
April 1993. The changes on charges apply to charges paid on or after 1 April
1993.*
Clause 110 fills gaps in the existing relief available for the restoration
and preparation of waste disposal sites.
The clause adds authorisations for the disposal of radioactive waste to the
lists of relevant licences, which in turn determines who can qualify for the
reliefs, and it extends the relief for site preparation to any expenditure
which is incurred before trading starts.
For anyone starting to trade on or after 1 April 1993 such expenditure will
be deemed to have been incurred on the first day of trading and in the
course of carrying on the trade.*
Clause 111 denies entitlement to relief under the Business Expansion Scheme
(BES) to individuals who obtain loans which are connected with shareholdings
they acquire through the Scheme.
It applies for shares issued on or after 16 March 1993.
Clause 112 makes clear that with effect from periods of account ending after
5 April 1993 tax relief will be due only for sums actually paid by employers
into occupational pension schemes and not for provisions or accruals in
respect of such pay-ments.
It also ensures that no deduction can, in any event, be allowed for sums
paid into schemes after 5 April 1993 to the extent that provisions in excess
of contributions actually paid have already been allowed for tax purposes.
Press release with draft clause 30 March 1993.*
CAPITAL ALLOWANCES
Clause 113 introduces the new temporary 20 per cent initial allowance for
industrial buildings announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be
available for new buildings contracted for in the year ending 31 October
1993 and brought into use by the end of 1994. Inland Revenue press releases
of 12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14 April 1993.
Clause 114 and Schedule 12 introduces the new 20 per cent initial allowance
for agricultural buildings announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be
available for new buildings contracted for in the year ending 31 October
1993 and brought into use by the end of 1994. Inland Revenue press releases
12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14 April 1993.
Clause 115 and Schedule 13 introduces the 40 per cent first year allowance
for machinery and plant announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be
available for expenditure incurred in the year ending 31 October 1993.
Inland Revenue press releases of 12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14
April 1993.
Clause 116 clarifies two points in the provisions which limit allowances for
machinery and plant leased within the first 10 years of its life to
non-residents not liable to UK tax.
The changes make it clearer how the provisions operate and have effect from
Budget day.*
Clause 117 amends existing provisions which allow connected persons to elect
to treat the sale of certain assets as having taken place at tax written
down value. It extends the scope of these provisions to qualifying hotels,
commercial buildings in enterprise zones and scientific research assets; and
allows elections only where both parties are entitled to capital allowances.
The changes have effect from Budget day.*
MISCELLANEOUS
Clause 118 amends the rules for UK companies which control foreign
companies. It provides that (subject to certain exclusions) such UK
companies will be liable to UK tax on profits of the foreign company arising
on or after 16 March 1993 where the overseas tax paid by that foreign
company is less than three quarters (previously one half) of the tax that
would be payable if it were resident in the UK.
Clause 119 and Schedule 14 make a number of changes to the legislation which
introduces Pay and File for companies in October this year. The amendments
relate to the transitional periods which straddle the change over date from
the old system; the circumstances in which claims to relief may be made by
members of groups; the payment of interest or repayment supplement where
losses or Advance Corporation Tax are carried back to earlier years; and
allow companies to authorise people other than the company secretary to sign
documents for tax purposes.
Clause 120 provides a power to make regulations about the repayment to a
friendly society of tax suffered on the investment income of its tax exempt
activities. It applies only to societies which are not wholly exempt.
The first accounting period to which the regulations may apply is that
commencing on or after 1 January 1994.*
Clause 121 amends the legislation requiring government departments to deduct
tax from certain payments, most particularly PAYE from wages and salaries.
It ensures that for 1993-94 onwards tax not deducted for earlier years, and
not otherwise recoverable, can be obtained from the government department.
It also brings government departments within the scope of interest and
penalty legislation where relevant.
EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES
Clause 122 and Clauses 123 to 167, with Schedules 15 to 18 introduce new
rules for the taxation of companies' foreign exchange gains and losses.
Exchange differences on qualifying assets and liabilities and forward
contracts to buy and sell currency are to be recognised for tax purposes as
they accrue (the translation basis) and taxed or relieved as income receipts
or deductions.
Clause 122 sets out how exchange gains and losses on qualifying assets
(broadly monetary assets - currency, debts and certain shares) and
liabilities are to be calculated.*
Clause 123 sets out how exchange gains and losses are to be calculated on a
forward contract to buy or sell currency.*
Clause 124 sets out modified rules for calculating exchange gains and losses
on a debt which varies in amount. A debt may vary in amount when part is
repaid, or when an additional tranche is borrowed.*
TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES
Clause 125 provides for exchange gains and losses on assets, liabilities and
currency contracts used for the purposes of a trade to be taken into account
as receipts and expenses of that trade.*
NON-TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES
Clause 126 and Clauses 127 to 130 contain the rules for dealing with
non-trading exchange gains and losses.*
Clause 127 includes the charging provision for net non-trading exchange
gains.*
Clause 128 sets out the rules for relief of any excess of non-trading
exchange losses over non-trading exchange gains.*
Clause 129 ensures that net exchange losses carried forward to a later
accounting period are available for relief in that later period only against
exchange gains.*
Clause 130 sets out how relief for excess non-trading exchange losses under
clause 128 interacts with other provisions of the Taxes Act 1988.*
ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION
Clause 131 and Schedule 15 provide for the amount of an initial exchange
gain or loss to be found in accordance with a method of calculation (the
'alternative method') which allows exchange differences to be left out of
account to the extent that they arise on assets, liabilities or contracts
held or owed in exempt circumstances, debts or currency representing income
that cannot be remitted to the UK or liabilities which are matched with
certain non-monetary assets under a matching election.*
MAIN BENEFIT TEST
Clause 132 denies relief for exchange losses on a foreign currency loan
where the accrual of an exchange loss is the main benefit, or one of the
main benefits, that might be expected to arise from borrowing or lending in
the particular currency.*
ARM'S-LENGTH TEST
Clause 133 provides for the 'ring-fencing' of exchange losses on a loan made
or received by a company which is entered into otherwise than on
arm's-length terms. Such losses will in general be available for relief only
against future exchange gains arising on the same loan. The application of
the clause is however limited in certain circumstances.*
Clause 134 provides for the ring-fencing of exchange losses on a forward
currency contract which is entered into otherwise than on arm's-length
terms.*
Clause 135 deals with the situation where exchange losses are carried
forward, under Clause 133 or 134, for set-off against future gains on an
asset, liability or contract, and there is a change in the local currency of
the trade.
The clause provides for the losses to be translated into the new currency.*
DEFERRAL OF UNREALISED GAINS
Clause 136, together with Clauses 137 to 140, allows companies to defer
taxation of unrealised exchange gains on long-term capital borrowings and
advances where those gains form a significant proportion of the taxable
profit.*
Clause 137 sets out the rules for deferral of unrealised gains which are the
subject of a claim under clause 136 above.*
Clause 138 defines the 'amount available for relief', which determines the
maximum amount in respect of which deferral can be claimed under clause
136.*
Clause 139 deals with the situation where deferral is or has been claimed in
relation to an asset or liability used for the purposes of a trade or part
of a trade whose basic profits and losses are computed in a currency or
currencies other than sterling.*
Clause 140 provides supplementary rules relating to the deferral provisions
in clauses 136 to 139.*
IRRECOVERABLE DEBTS
Clause 141 deals with the situation where all or part of a debt owed to or
by a company is regarded as irrecoverable.
The nominal amount of the debt is deemed to be reduced by the irrecoverable
amount.*
Clause 142 deals with the situation where a debt has been treated as reduced
under clause 141 because all or part of the amount previously regarded as
irrecoverable becomes recoverable. The amount which becomes recoverable is
to be treated as a new debt or as an increase in the nominal amount of an
existing debt.*
CURRENCY CONTRACTS: SPECIAL CASES
Clause 143 deals with the situation where a currency contract is terminated
early, so that there is no acquisition or disposal of currency under the
contract. It provides for a balancing adjustment to be made to recover or
give relief, depending on the circumstances.*
Clause 144 ensures that where a currency contract is closed out by means of
a reciprocal currency contract, no exchange gains and losses are recognised
from the closing out date on either contract, and the first contract is
treated as having been terminated, without delivery or acquisition of the
underlying currency, at that date.*
EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES
Clause 145 provides for a balancing adjustment to be made on an asset or
liability ceasing to exist where net exchange gains have been taxed but
there is an overall loss, not otherwise taken into account for tax purposes,
on the asset or liability, or net exchange losses have been relieved but
there is an overall gain, not otherwise taken into account for tax purposes,
on the asset or liability. The detailed rules are to be set out in Treasury
regulations.*
LOCAL CURRENCY TO BE USED
Clause 146 defines 'local currency' for the purposes of computing exchange
gains and losses under Clauses 122 to 125.*
EXCHANGE RATE TO BE USED
Clause 147 sets out rules for determining the exchange rate to be used in
translating amounts or values into a company's local currency.*
Clause 148 adapts the rules for determining exchange rate in Clause 147 to
cover debts which vary in amount.*
INTERPRETATION: COMPANIES
Clause 149 identifies the companies ('qualifying companies') to which the
new rules on taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses apply.*
INTERPRETATION: ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CONTRACTS
Clause 150 defines the assets and liabilities ('qualifying assets and
liabilities') which are within the scope of the new provisions on exchange
gains and losses.*
Clause 151 sets out rules to determine when a company becomes or ceases to
be entitled to an asset for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and
losses on the asset.*
Clause 152 sets out rules to determine when a company becomes or ceases to
be subject to a liability for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and
losses on the liability.*
Clause 153 contains explanatory provisions to identify debts by reference to
the facts and to deal with debts that do not legally come into existence.*
Clause 154 explains when a company is treated as holding a forward contract
to buy or sell currency for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and
losses on the currencies to be exchanged under the contract.*
INTERPRETATION: OTHER PROVISIONS
Clause 155 defines translation times and accrual periods, by reference to
which exchange gains and losses are calculated under clauses 122 to 124.*
Clause 156 defines the 'basic valuation' of an asset or liability which is
within the scope of the new provisions on exchange gains and losses.*
Clause 157 defines the nominal currency of each type of asset and liability
to which the new provisions apply.*
Clause 158 sets out rules to determine the settlement currency of a debt.*
Clause 159 sets out rules to determine the nominal amount of a debt which is
outstanding at any particular time.*
Clause 160 defines the local currency of a trade.*
Clause 161 contains various interpretation provisions for the purposes of
Chapter II.
MISCELLANEOUS
Clause 162 and Schedule 16 provide that the new rules for taxing foreign
exchange gains and losses are to apply from the first day of a company's
first accounting period to begin on or after an appointed day. Where a
qualifying asset, currency contract or qualifying liability is held or owed
on the commencement date the company is to be treated as if it became
entitled or subject to the asset, contract or liability on that date.
Regulations will provide transitional rules for such items.*
Clause 163 allows a 'just and reasonable' adjustment to be made where a
company changes its accounting date, and hence its commencement day under
clause 162(7), for the purpose of securing a tax advantage.*
Clause 164 contains miscellaneous provisions concerning orders and
regulations.*
Clause 165 allows regulations to provide special rules for the treatment of
exchange differences in respect of assets and liabilities held by insurance
companies.*
Clause 166 and Schedule 17 provide that qualifying assets currently subject
to capital gains tax will cease to be so.*
Clause 167 and Schedule 18 make various amendments to the taxes acts to
accommodate the effects of the new provisions on foreign exchange gains and
losses.*
LLOYD'S UNDERWRITERS ETC MAIN PROVISIONS
Clause 168 provides that the profits from the underwriting business of a
Lloyd's member are to be chargeable to income tax as trading profits.
It also sets out the years for which underwriting losses can be set off
against general income.
Clause 169 sets out the general rules for deciding for which year of
assessment the various categories of profit or loss arising from an
underwriting business are to be brought into account.
Clause 170 and Schedule 19 continue the arrangements for assessing and
collecting tax on underwriting profits arising from a member's syndicates
and from the funds in which his premiums received are invested ('premiums
trust funds').
MEMBER'S TRUST FUNDS
Clause 171 treats assets in premiums trust funds as acquired and disposed of
each year, with the exception of certain UK securities where an exemption
applies for particular non-resident holders.
Clause 172 and Schedule 20 provide the tax arrangements for the new special
reserve fund. Tax deductibility is available for up to 50 per cent of a
member's profits transferred to reserve each year subject to an overall fund
value limit of 50 per cent of the member's overall premium limit.
Income and gains on assets within the fund will be free of tax.
Withdrawals from the fund will be required, notably, to meet losses and
where the member ceases underwriting, and will be treated as trading income.
The new reserve will apply from 1992-93.
The clause and schedule also provide for the winding up of the existing
special reserve fund, for which the last year will be 1991-92.
Clause 173 provides that the gains or losses on the disposal of assets in
funds other than a premiums trust fund or the new reserve fund, continue to
be subject to capital gains tax and are not brought within the computation
of trading profits.
OTHER SPECIAL CASES
Clause 174 sets out that relief for payments ('reinsurance to close'
premiums) which one syndicate makes to its successor to take over its
outstanding liabilities is available to the extent that the payments are
fair and reasonable having regard to the liabilities transferred.
Clause 175 provides rules giving relief for payments and charging receipts
in respect of loss insurance and of the new Lloyd's High Level Stop Loss
Fund. It also provides relief for payments made to transfer to someone else
a member's rights and liabilities in respect of business he has
underwritten.
Clause 176 enables the board to make regulations setting out the extent and
manner of deductibility for accountancy fees payable by members in respect
of their underwriting business.
MISCELLANEOUS
Clause 177 provides that the final year of assessment of a member's
underwriting business is generally that in which his deposit at Lloyd's is
repaid, subject, in cases of death, to the final year not being later than
the year in which the underwriter dies.
Clause 178 sets out that profits from an underwriting business are to
constitute earned income for tax purposes. This applies to profits
assessable after 1992-93.
Clause 179 removes an extended time limit (which is no longer necessary) for
Lloyd's underwriting agents in relation to a claim for a deduction against
profits for a year in respect of emoluments paid after that year. It has
effect for periods of account ending on or after 30 June 1993.
SUPPLEMENTAL
Clause 180 enables the board to make regulations on specified matters
affecting the taxation of members, and provides for regulations made under
legislation which is being repealed to continue to have effect where
appropriate.
Clause 181 makes a number of consequential amendments to references in other
provisions of tax legislation affecting Lloyd's members.
Clause 182 defines various terms used in the legislation.
OIL TAXATION
Clause 183 abolishes petroleum revenue tax for oil and gas fields given
development consent on or after 16 March 1993 ('non-taxable' fields) and
makes amendments so that expenditure can be apportioned as appropriate
between those fields and fields within the charge to the tax.*
Clause 184 reduces the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50
per cent from 1 July 1993 and makes adjustments to the limit on interest
payable on repayments of petroleum revenue tax arising where losses are
carried back.
Those adjustments reduce the limit in line with the rate reduction and
correct an anomaly in the existing rules which discounted advance petroleum
revenue tax in calculating the limitation.*
Clause 185 disapplies the petroleum revenue tax rules relating to returns
and information for fields ('non-taxable fields') outside the charge to
petroleum revenue tax and introduces a PRT version of the corporation tax
powers in Section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, to request specific
information from taxpayers and third parties. Schedule 21 is a PRT version
of the taxpayer safeguards in Section 20B of that Act.*
Clause 186 abolishes relief against petroleum revenue tax paid by 'taxable'
fields for expenditure incurred on or after 16 March 1993 on exploring for
'non-taxable' fields and then appraising them, subject to transitional
arrangements.
These arrangements allow continued relief against the income of existing
fields provided that expenditure is incurred within two years of 16 March
1993 under a contract for exploration and appraisal in force before that
date, or the expenditure is necessary for the completion of the obligation
under that contract.
Expenditure incurred after a break clause in a contract could have been
triggered, or after exercise of an option, will not get the transitional
relief.*
Clause 187 provides for the situation where an asset is used in connection
with a field outside the charge to petroleum revenue tax (a 'non-taxable
field') either before or after it is used in connection with a field within
the charge to petroleum revenue tax (a 'taxable' field), so that relief
against petroleum revenue tax may, as appropriate, be restricted.
This clause also ensures that receipts from asset disposals, or from
third-party use of assets, are limited or charged to PRT at market value, as
appropriate, to prevent artificial reduction of petroleum revenue tax
liability by transactions between connected parties.*
Clause 188 introduces, for claims received after 16 March 1993, a definition
covering the time when expenditure is incurred for petroleum revenue tax
purposes. The definition is based on when the claimant has an unconditional
obligation to pay, provided that the amount of expenditure incurred is not
disproportionate to the extent to which the contract has been performed.
There is an extra, temporary, test to discourage the use of 'front-end
loaded' procurement contracts to obtain 75 per cent PRT relief on future
supplies of assets or services.
This clause also clarifies the effect of an existing anti-avoidance rule
(the 'restriction to cost' rule) limiting relief for expenditure in
transactions between connected persons to costs incurred under the latest
arm's length transaction. That clarification includes a separate new
definition of when such costs are incurred.
It applies to connected-person transactions on or after 16 March 1993.*
Clause 189 introduces provisions preventing expenditure incurred after the
end of a six-month chargeable period getting relief against petroleum
revenue tax in that, or any earlier, period (other than by carry-back of
losses).
The provisions apply to claims received after 16 March 1993 or, in the case
of exploration and appraisal expenditure, costs incurred after 31 March
1993.
Clause 190 makes a number of changes to the treatment for petroleum revenue
tax purposes of receipts from asset disposals or third-party use of assets
and to corresponding payments.
Fields providing services will not benefit from the tariff receipts
allowance when tariffs are paid from a field outside the charge to petroleum
revenue tax (a 'non-taxable' field).
Foreign fields, or foreign parts of fields, will be treated broadly in line
with UK fields. And payments from participators in 'taxable' fields to
connected persons in 'non-taxable' fields will not be allowed relief against
petroleum revenue tax.*
Clause 191 facilitates double taxation relief from PRT chargeable on
receipts arising from the use by UK oil fields of assets connected to
foreign fields, but situated in the UK or on the UK continental shelf.*
Clause 192 defines terms used in previous clauses and provides that the
Board of Inland Revenue will be able to make any amendments to decisions on
expenditure claims and to tax assessments that are necessary following
enactment of the provisions in Clauses 183 to 192 (inclusive).*
INHERITANCE TAX
Clause 193 sets the inheritance tax threshold for the year 1993-94 at Pounds
150,000.
Clause 194 provides for the base month for indexation of the inheritance tax
rate bands to be changed from December to September with effect from
1994-95. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget.
Clause 195 extends fall in value relief to investments which are cancelled
within 12 months of the date of death and to investments quotation of which
is suspended at a date 12 months after death.
The change applies to deaths occurring on or after 16 March 1992.
Clause 196 extends from three to four years after death the period during
which houses or other real or leasehold property may be sold and the sale
price substituted for the value at death. The change applies to deaths
occurring on or after 16 March 1990.
Clause 197 allows the special commissioners to refer to the Lands Tribunal
questions as to the valuation of land.
STAMP DUTY
Clause 198 increases the threshold for the 1 per cent stamp duty on sales of
land, buildings and certain other property from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
60,000.
It also increases from Pounds 300 pa to Pounds 600 pa the rental limit for
premiums under new leases to benefit from the threshold. The increases take
effect for documents executed on or after 16 March 1993 (providing they are
not stamped before 23 March 1993).*
Clause 199 puts right an anomaly in the application of stamp duty to houses
purchased in England and Wales under the 'rents-to-mortgages' scheme being
introduced by the Housing Bill. It ensures that the stamp duty threshold
will apply to houses purchased under rents to mortgages in the same way as
to properties purchased in the wider market.*
Clause 200 makes provision similar to clause 199 for stamp duty in respect
of the parallel scheme, 'rent-to-loan', being introduced in Scotland.*
Clause 201 provides enabling powers for the Treasury to make regulations as
to the method by which stamp duty is denoted. Current legislation requires
the use of 'impressed' stamps. This provision does not affect the amount of
duty payable on a transaction. Inland Revenue Press Release of 14 April 1993
'Stamp Duty: Method of Stamping'.
MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL
Statutory effect of resolutions etc
Clause 202 amends the rules for giving immediate (but temporary) statutory
effect to changes to income tax, petroleum revenue tax, supplementary
petroleum duty, VAT and duties of customs and excise on the passing of a
resolution by the House of Commons. The clause also brings corporation tax
within the scope of these rules. This follows the decision to move to a
November Budget.
Clause 203 allows, if an appropriate resolution is passed by the House of
Commons, assessments to be made to corporation tax for a financial year at
rates which are lower than the rates for that year charged in an Act.
This applies for the financial year 1993 and subsequent years.
Clause 204 amends the rules for resolutions giving immediate (but temporary)
effect to changes in stamp duty. This follows the decision to move to a
November Budget.
MISCELLANEOUS
Clause 205 amends the rules for determining whether individuals who are in
the UK for a temporary purpose only are resident for tax purposes.
It abolishes the rule that those who have accommodation here available for
their use are resident for any year in which they visit this country. This
change takes effect from 6 April 1993 and will apply for both income tax and
capital gains tax purposes.*
Clause 206 ends the liability to gas levy (subject to the approval of the
secretary of state for trade and industry and the Treasury) where a pre-1975
petroleum revenue tax exempt contract is terminated on the grounds that
continued supply has become uneconomic. In those circumstances the rule
allowing up to 5 per cent of cumulative production from the field to be sold
outside the contract without liability to petroleum revenue tax also ends.
Clause 207 and Schedule 22 makes provision to amend the Government Trading
Funds Act 1973. It permits opening capital to be financed by reserves,
enables public dividend capital to be used to finance any expenditure by a
trading fund and make consequential amendments to trading funds borrowing
limits.
Clause 208 this clause allows for technical changes to the arrangements for
issuing gilt-edged securities. The changes are purely internal to the public
sector and have no implications for the gilt market as a whole.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Profession finds few surprises and much to
digest - Tax Practitioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX PRACTITIONERS were yesterday busily digesting the fine print of one of
the lengthiest finance bills in recent years, while stressing it contained
few surprises.
If the chancellor's Budget speech in March provided the hors d'ouevres, the
finance bill represented a substantial main course filling in the details.
'It is a very impenetrable document, very technical and surprisingly thick,'
said Mr Chris Adams, a tax partner with accountants Arthur Andersen. 'They
certainly haven't skimped on the words. This will provide a lot of work for
the profession.'
Mr Roger White, head of tax at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'For
practitioners, this is a bit like being given a new comic as a child. We can
study, enjoy and grow to like it over the next few days.'
The bill runs to more than 300 pages, with 211 clauses and 19 detailed
schedules. Part of its significance lies in the fact that it follows the
Budget speech so closely.
Most important, it showed little sign of backing down from the chancellor's
more controversial proposals, such as the removal of zero-rating on domestic
fuel, and changes to petroleum revenue tax and advance corporation tax
(ACT).
'This very closely follows the Budget speech,' said Mr Maurice
Parry-Wingfield from Touche Ross. 'Everything is in there that we expected.
There is nothing new.'
He pointed out that omissions - as already anticipated - included
legislation on inheritance tax relief for traders at the London
International Financial Futures Exchange.
Much of the wording reflected the intentions laid down in the Budget speech
or the press releases that accompanied it. The clauses on ACT mirrored draft
versions already circulated. Among the lengthier items covered are changes
to excise duties and Value Added Tax; details of the duty on the new
national lottery; the treatment of overseas life insurance companies; and
provisions for underwriters on the Lloyd's insurance market.
There is also a substantial section on the taxation of exchange gains and
losses. Mr Richard Law, a tax partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said
his firm was disappointed that the bill contained this section. This meant
there had been no time to include comments on the draft proposals issued
earlier this year.
There are also many attempts throughout the bill to introduce anti-avoidance
clauses designed to prevent taxpayers from taking advantage of loopholes.
Practitioners said considerable time must have been taken by the Inland
Revenue to close a number of existing loopholes and prevent the creation of
new ones.
Other changes included confirmation of changes in the classification of
residency for tax purposes; tightening taxation for foreign-controlled
corporations; and final details of the pay and file system for corporations
to be introduced from this September.
Mr Andrew Evans, an employee benefits partner at Price Waterhouse,
highlighted as important a new definition of 'accessories' to be applied to
company cars, and amendments to discretionary trusts affecting funded
unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
Mr Adams said there were clauses in the legislation which would lead to test
cases in the courts, such as clarifying when interest is payable in relation
to debts between associated companies. 'The wording is not as clear and
straightforward as you might expect,' he said.
Mr White added: 'The bill is a whole collection of bits and pieces.'
'It's a terrible mish-mash, which jumps from one provision to another. If
one thing stands out, it is advance corporation tax.'
But he stressed the bill would be very interesting for specialists and
generate considerable work: 'You won't find tax practitioners jumping out of
windows.' The firm will be analysing the bill and encouraging its
professionals to sell on their advice to clients so they can be guided 'down
the cheapest route.'
'We will have a pretty good workload,' he said. 'And there is another Budget
at the end of the year.'

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Government stands firm on oil reforms -
North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government stood firm on its controversial reforms of North Sea oil
taxation yesterday. The Finance Bill left unchanged the proposals put
forward by Mr Norman Lamont in his Budget last month, in spite of protests
from parts of the oil and gas industry.
Under the bill the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) will be reduced from
75 per cent to 50 per cent on existing oil and gas fields, and abolished
altogether on those given government consent after the Budget.
But rules which allow oil companies to set exploration and development costs
against profits from existing fields will also be changed. The cost of new
fields started after the Budget cannot be offset against profits from older
fields.
However, transitional arrangements are proposed to cushion the impact of the
changes: contracts entered into before the Budget will continue to be
eligible for relief for two years.
The bill also proposes provisions for streamlining North Sea oil taxation.
The tax reforms were said by Mr Lamont to be necessary to encourage oil
companies to become more efficient in both drilling for oil and gas, and
extracting it.
The existing rules were 'anachronistic', he said, and belonged to a time
when oil prices were high and the typical oilfield was very large. Oil
prices were now low, and it was important that companies have an incentive
to extract the maximum from their fields.
The changes would transform what was in effect a tax subsidy for oil
explorers to a revenue earner for the Treasury: the yield in 1994-95 would
be Pounds 300m and in 1995-96 Pounds 400m.
Mr Lamont's proposals have already been welcomed by large North Sea
operators such as BP which maintain that the old tax regime discriminated
against large producers.
But they were strongly opposed by exploration companies who claimed that the
changes would discourage new drilling and cost thousands of jobs in offshore
services, and onshore support and fabrication industries.
Although some oil companies said yesterday that they were disappointed by
the bill, they said further changes might still be possible as the oil lobby
gears up to influence the debate in parliament.
The UK Offshore Operators Association, which earlier warned that the changes
would 'put a substantial burden on the industry', declined to comment on the
Finance Bill yesterday. The association said it would be discussing contents
of the bill with its members.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Names' affairs simplified by rules -
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S finance bill contains nothing to surprise tax practitioners who
specialise in the affairs of troubled Lloyd's insurance market.
'Above all the new rules simplify taxation arrangements for Names and make
them easier,' said Mr Mike Voller, specialist with BDO Binder Hamlyn, the
accountancy firm. He said the bill simply supplied greater detail about
changes first announced in last month's Budget.
He is positive about new arrangements for reserving, which 'make it much
more attractive to be in Lloyd's, always assuming that Lloyd's can do
something to clear the decks of its past problems.'
The new arrangements do nothing to help Names already hit by heavy losses,
but allow them to establish tax-free reserves against heavy losses they may
incur in the future.
Under the new arrangements - which come into in effect to cover the 1992
underwriting year - Names will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of
profits to the new reserve each year, provided the value of the funds in the
reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income
limit. Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls
withdrawals that are not used to meet losses will attract tax.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: New tax break for lump-sum payments -
Company Cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW tax deduction is to be introduced for employees who make 'lump-sum'
payments to the initial expenditure on their company cars, the government
announced yesterday.
The government is also prepared to consider suggestions for other detailed
changes to the proposed company car tax reforms announced in the Budget, the
Inland Revenue said yesterday.
Any further changes must be aimed at achieving the objective of 'a fair and
efficient tax charge on company cars'.
The present system of company car taxation is to be significantly overhauled
with the introduction of a new scheme from April 1994.
The chancellor said in the Budget that the new system was intended to make
the tax charged on company cars a more fair measure of the benefit people
received. The new system should eliminate distortions in the new car market
and encourage the use of more fuel-efficient cars.
The present broad scale of charges will be replaced by a new measure of the
benefit of a car for private use, based on a charge equivalent to 35 per
cent of the list price of the car.
There will be a discount of a third if the employee drives more than 2,500
business miles in a year, or two thirds if the employee drives 18,000 or
more business miles.
The most significant further change announced yesterday in the Finance Bill
makes provision for employees who contribute capital sums to the initial
expenditure on their company cars - for example in order to have particular
accessories added to their cars.
The bill defines the the list price of a car as 'the price for the car
published by the manufacturer, distributor or importer of the car, when the
car was first registered, including VAT and any other relevant tax and any
delivery charge; plus the price for any optional accessories provided with
the car when it was first made available to the employee'.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Indexation month to change - Personal
Allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of a November Budget means that the base month for the
indexation of personal allowances will also have to change. Traditionally,
these are increased annually in line with inflation, although this year Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, broke with that tradition by
deciding to freeze personal allowances.
Until the last Budget, the amount of increase was based on the retail price
index measured from the 12 months to Decem-ber. However, the new base month
from this year will be Septem-ber.
This means that if the chancellor were to decide to increase personal
allowances for April 1994 the amount would be based on the in-crease in the
RPI from September 1992-93.
According to Mr Michael Bishopp of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm,
the new base date should not have a significant effect on individuals,
mainly because of the chancellor's decision to freeze personal taxation
allowances this year.
'The chancellor had decided to lose this year's indexation so there is no
longer a con-tinuous period on which the next increase would be based,' said
Mr Bishopp.
The new base month of September will apply to all personal allowances, the
amount of capital gains tax exemption, the inheritance tax threshold, the
pensions earnings cap and the limit between the 20 per cent and 25 per cent
rate tax band.

FT  15 APR 93 / A sherry by any other name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SHERRY is to be called 'fortified British wine' from the end of
1995, the British Wine Producers' Committee said yesterday.
Disagreement over the name almost reached the European Court of Justice last
year. Spain argued that UK excise duties were used illegally to discriminate
in favour of British sherry, which contains less alcohol than the Spanish
variety.
Spain dropped the court action when the government promised to stop calling
the British product 'sherry' after 1995, and to reduce the duty difference
to 25 per cent by the end of 1996.
Genuine Spanish sherry must come from the Jerez region and be matured for
three years in wooden casks.
British sherry is made in vats from reconstituted grape juice imported from
Cyprus and elsewhere.
Mr Tony Grayson, chairman of the committee, said the term fortified British
wine 'will be understood and readily accepted by consumers, who are
particularly loyal to the product type'.

FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Relief for moving expenses - Job Transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES who buy another house because their job requires them to move will
be able to claim tax relief on moving expenses, even if they do not plan to
sell their former home, the Finance Bill made clear yesterday .
The new home must be the employee's main residence. If the former home is
rented out, or is just visited at weekends, the new house will qualify as
the principal residence, the Inland Revenue said.
The main change on tax relief and relocation expenses, announced in the
Budget and set out in the bill, introduced a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 on
relief from April 6. Before that relief was, in effect, uncapped.
The move has been condemned by the Confederation of British Industry which
says relocation costs average Pounds 25,000 and can rise to more than Pounds
50,000. The Budget also scrapped concessions on payments to employees if
they had to move to more expensive areas.
The government said yesterday it intended to introduce two amendments to the
Finance Bill at the committee stage. One will provide some relief for
employees whose bridging arrangements include a loan from their companies;
the other will make it clear that tax relief for international travel will
be in addition to relief for removals.
It also emerged yesterday that further regulations, beyond the Finance Bill,
will be needed to implement all aspects of the new relocation rules. The
regulations will be needed so employers do not have to deduct tax under PAYE
if total payments and benefits exceed Pounds 8,000.

FT  15 APR 93 / Production rise spread evenly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEBRUARY'S RISE in manufacturing output was fairly evenly spread across all
sectors, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The sharp 1.2 per cent increase in February, compared with January, lifted
output above the very narrow range it languished in for most of last year,
and followed a revised 1.3 per cent month-on-month increase in January.
Compared with a year ago, output was 1.5 per cent higher.
This was the third successive monthly increase in manufacturing output and
led a number of analysts to conclude that, at least in the manufacturing
sector, the recession was over.
'It looks as though the turning point was in the fourth quarter of last
year, and that we are now in the early stages of an upturn,' said Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London.
Output over the three months to February was particularly buoyant in the
chemicals and engineering industries.
Higher production of pharmaceuticals boosted chemicals output by 2.7 per
cent compared with the previous three-month period.
In the engineering industries, a 1.6 per cent three-month on three-month
rise in output was driven almost entirely by the computer industry where
sales have been particularly strong and exports healthy.
Engineering was given a further boost by increased output of computer
components and electronic consumer goods.
There was an unusually steep rise in the output of investment goods.
Investment goods production was 2.6 per cent higher in the latest three
months, and 4.1 per cent higher than in the same three months a year ago.
The CSO said the healthy computer and electrical goods figures were behind
the steep increase.
Output of the food in-dustries over the past three months was fairly flat,
although a bumper sugar harvest boosted production sharply in February. Food
industry output rose by 0.2 per cent in the latest three months compared
with the three months to November, but rose 3.2 per cent, month-on-month, in
February.
Production was weakest in minerals output, which rose only 0.1 per cent in
the latest three months. In February, however, increased demand for building
materials boosted output sharply.
Energy output was 2.1 per cent lower in the three months to February
compared with the previous three months. Oil output fell 2.4 per cent as
winter storms in the North Sea disrupted oil production.
Other energy production was 1.9 per cent lower over the same period after
mild weather reduced the demand for gas and electricity.
Within consumer goods, a rise in the production of durable goods and
pharmaceuticals more than offset a drop in car production over the three
months to February.
During this period, overall output rose by 0.9 per cent, compared with the
previous three months.
The CSO estimates that manufacturing output is now increasing at a trend
growth rate of 3 per cent year-on-year once monthly fluctuations are taken
out.

FT  15 APR 93 / Confidence up in financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in nearly all sectors of the financial services industry
has strengthened markedly for the second successive quarter, a Confederation
of British Industry survey shows.
The survey, conducted quarterly with accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand,
covers more than 300 companies including banks, finance houses, building
societies, life and general insurance companies, fund managers, securities
traders and venture capitalists.
The survey, which covers the period to the end of February, found that while
business volumes fell slightly, they fell more slowly than in the previous
quarter and are now expected to increase in the three months to June.
Volumes picked up for most fund managers, insurance brokers and security
traders, while the sharpest declines were reported by life insurers and
venture capitalists. Some 39 per cent of life insurance respondents said
that sales volumes actually fell in the period, in spite of expectations
that they would rise. Sluggish demand, intense domestic competition and the
threat of legislation are all seen as impediments to future business.
While profitability is improving for the banking sector, 49 per cent of
respondents reported an increase in non-performing loans which has
restrained the improved earnings which should have accompanied the rise in
fee and commission income.
Meanwhile, the survey found that in all sectors of the financial services
industry, margins widened further and average fees, commissions and premiums
grew strongly over the last quarter, although their value grew more slowly
than in the previous quarter.
Industry respondents also reported lower costs for the sixth consecutive
survey period. The sharpest cost reductions were reported by venture
capitalists, general insurers, finance houses and building societies.
Profitability also increased moderately overall, with fund managers,
insurance brokers and general insurance companies reporting the largest
increases.

FT  15 APR 93 / British Coal considers court help in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL seems certain to ask the High Court to resolve a dispute over
10 pits earmarked for early closure unless three of its four main unions
have a change of heart in the next few days.
Following a High Court ruling that its original closure plans were illegal,
the corporation has given the unions until today to respond to its latest
proposal on consultations.
This involves the appointment of a single scrutineer to study all closures
'in a single procedure', rather than each one individually, as suggested by
the National Union of Mineworkers.
The British Association of Colliery Management has said it is willing to
accept the suggestion. Other unions are still considering how to respond.
In spite of today's deadline, British Coal is likely to allow the unions
several days before returning to the High Court for a ruling.
It has for some months been indicating it will not apply the Modified
Colliery Review Procedure, previously used as the conciliation procedure for
closures in the industry, either to the 10 or another nine the corporation
wants to close, mothball or cease large-scale production at. MCRP procedures
can take nine months.
British Coal believes the court would be satisfied by its use of John T.
Boyd, the US consultancy which has already evaluated the pits, and by the
appointment of a single scrutineer. In a letter to unions before Easter it
said the scrutineer could consider each pit individually. A review could be
carried out by mid-May, it said.
The corporation has also told the unions it does not believe an 'independent
element' is required in consultations involving the nine to be closed,
mothballed or placed on development work only.
British Coal wants to cease coaling at the six to be mothballed at the end
of April.
The government has formally rejected calls by the Commons employment
committee that it failed to take into account the full financial cost of pit
closures.

BRITISH COAL and managers of its pension scheme said yesterday they expected
the High Court to consider within the next month a dispute over the use of
part of a Pounds 1bn surplus. The government and British Coal want to
recover the corporation's share of the surplus, thought to be worth Pounds
480m, by withholding payments due to the fund to cover the cost of early
retirements. British Coal and the scheme said they wanted the issue sorted

FT  15 APR 93 / Doubt over orimulsion projections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP BITOR, the sole importer of orimulsion to the UK, is expecting to keep
sales at existing levels during the next few years. Its hopes cast doubts on
government assertions that consumption of the bitumen-based fuel is likely
to fall.
Mr Stuart Johnston, BP Bitor commercial director, says the company aims for
sales to continue at about 1.3m tonnes to 1.5m tonnes a year for the next
few years and hopes to increase the figure further by the end of the
century.
The ambitions of BT Bitor, a joint venture between BP and Petroleos de
Venezuela, will cause concern at British Coal which is already struggling to
find a future for 12 pits reprieved by the government last month.
In its coal white paper, launched after the public outcry over previous pit
closure plans, the government said it had been informed by the Venezuelan
authorities that orimulsion exports were likely to stay at their minimum
contractual level for the foreseeable future.
'This should entail a reduction in the consumption of orimulsion in the
United Kingdom of at least 500,000 tonnes of coal equivalent a year from
current levels,' the white paper said.
In subsequent interviews, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, made frequent mention of the likely decline in demand for
orimulsion.
Energy industry analysts agreed there could be some reduction because of the
government's intention to subsidise coal, which would make orimulsion less
attractive to the electricity generators.
However, they were surprised at the prediction of a drop of as much as
500,000 tonnes, given that the government had rejected suggestions that
orimulsion should be subjected to stricter environmental controls that coal.
In the short term, competition from orimulsion will affect demand for
British coal only at the margins, although existing import levels are the
equivalent to the output of one pit, or about 1.5m tonnes of coal.
In three or four years time, however, the fuel will pose a greater threat as
subsidies for coal run out and stricter pollution controls on all fuels come
into practice. Electricity generators believe that recent rulings by the
Pollution Inspectorate mean they may have to fit equipment to reduce sulphur
levels on all coal-fired and oil-fired power stations in heavy use.
This would favour orimulsion, which is burned in oil-fired stations. If
generators had to choose between fitting such equipment to coal-fired or
oil-fired power stations they may opt for the latter because they have been
used less in recent years and have a longer life expectancy.

FT  15 APR 93 / British Coal considers court help in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL seems certain to ask the High Court to resolve a dispute over
10 pits earmarked for early closure unless three of its four main unions
have a change of heart in the next few days.
Following a High Court ruling that its original closure plans were illegal,
the corporation has given the unions until today to respond to its latest
proposal on consultation procedures.
This involves the appointment of a single scrutineer to study all closures
'in a single procedure', rather than each one individually, as suggested by
the National Union of Mineworkers.
The British Association of Colliery Management has said it is willing to
accept the suggestion. Other unions are still considering how to respond.
In spite of today's deadline, British Coal is likely to allow the unions
several days before returning to the High Court for a ruling.
British Coal has for some months been indicating it will not apply the
Modified Colliery Review Procedure, previously used as the conciliation
procedure for closures in the industry, either to the 10 or another nine the
corporation wants to close, mothball or cease large-scale production at.
MCRP procedures can take nine months.
British Coal believes the High Court would be satisfied by its use of John
T. Boyd, the US consultancy which has already evaluated the pits, and by the
appointment of a single scrutineer. In a letter to unions before Easter it
said the scrutineer could consider each pit individually.
A review could be carried out by the middle of May, it said.
The corporation has also told the unions it does not believe an 'independent
element' is required in consultations involving the nine to be closed,
mothballed or placed on development work only.
Consultations on closure or mothballing procedures should be 'initiated at
local level.'
British Coal wants to cease coaling at the six to be mothballed at the end
of April.
Meanwhile, the High Court is expected to consider a separate dispute over
staff pensions within a month after the corporation and the pension scheme
managers agreed the terms of litigation arising from a fund surplus.
The dispute centres on the government's and British Coal's desire to cease
making payments into a fund for early retirement as a result of the surplus.

FT  15 APR 93 / Sea 'could provide 20% of energy': Experimental tidal power
station to be developed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TIDEMILLS to harness fast-flowing sea currents around the coast could supply
almost one fifth of the UK's electricity needs, says a report commissioned
by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The report, by a group led by Engineering and Power Development Consultants,
a subsidiary of Balfour Beatty, the civil engineering group, says the main
potential for 'tidal stream energy' lies in the Pentland Firth, between the
Scottish mainland and Orkney - where tidal currents can run at up to 12mph -
and around the Channel Islands.
The Pentland Firth alone could supply three times as much electricity as
hydro-electric power stations, at present Britain's biggest source of
renewable energy, with 1,000MW of installed capacity.
Other areas with significant potential include the Bristol Channel and parts
of the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, together with
smaller sites off Port-land Bill in Dorset and off Scotland's west coast.
The report recommends the use of proven technology, mainly derived from
offshore engineering and windpower expertise.
It envisages arrays of 'tide mills' using underwater propellers with
diameters of 20 metres. These would either be fixed towers tied to the
seabed, dropped from sea surface floats or suspended in mid-water below wave
level, using a small-scale adaptation of the technology used in
'tension-leg' oil platforms.
The authors are cautious about costs, stressing that these are tentative as
no tide-mills yet exist. However, they believe that some of the best
Pentland Firth sites could produce power at under 10p per kilowatt.
Mr Peter Fraenkel, one of the authors, says experience of other renewable
energy research suggests that costs could be cut to half or less of
estimates once tidemill generating sets were mass-produced.
This summer his 12-strong company, IT Power, will co-operate with Scottish
Nuclear and NEL - formerly the National Engineering Laboratory of East
Kilbride, near Glasgow - in installing the world's first sea-current power
station on an experimental basis in the Corran Narrows in Loch Linnhe, near
Fort William. The 10KW unit is regarded as 'a proof of concept' experiment
costing just under Pounds 200,000.
Mr Fraenkel said power from sea currents was '100 per cent predictable,
making it far more reliable than electricity wind energy farms or wave power
sites, which produce nothing when the air or sea is calm'.
The study was carried out for the DTI by Engineering and Power Development
Consultants, with civil engineering consultants Binnie and Partners and
builders Sir Robert McAlpine as part of the Renewable Energy Research and
Development Programme managed by the Energy Technology Support Unit.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Overburdened but optimistic - John
Authers listens to teachers in conference at Bournemouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS spent most of their time in Bournemouth yesterday trying to
demonstrate that they are overworked. With almost equal dedication,
delegates to the NASUWT conference also tried to prove they are
professional.
These are the two main planks in the union's opposition to the government's
proposed national curriculum tests: the dispute is over workloads and the
claim that implementing the tests places an unreasonable work burden on
them. This is a legitimate ground for industrial action.
The union won its case in the High Court against Wandsworth Borough Council
by taking this stand. If their action is held to be politically motivated,
it could yet be ruled illegal by the Appeal Court, whose judgment is
expected next week, or by the House of Lords.
A large quote from Wandsworth's director of education even hangs above the
stage of the conference. In it he is quoted as calling the national
curriculum 'over-bureaucratic and unworkable. The sooner it is buried the
better.'
Support from parents, who are said to be asking for children to be withdrawn
from the tests, has also been claimed.
NASUWT members are also taking heart from the actions of other teachers'
unions following the Wandsworth ruling.
The decision by the traditionally moderate ATL union, which is not
affiliated to the TUC, to ballot its members on a test boycott came after Mr
John Patten, the education secretary, addressed the ATL conference.
Mr Richard Hinton, an NASUWT delegate and history teacher at a Staffordshire
comprehensive, said: 'Anyone who can go to the ATL and make them take action
after 25 years of inaction has a great talent.'
Support from the ATL, with a membership roughly the same size as NASUWT's,
increases the chance that action could be effective.
But the decision by the NUT, the biggest teachers' union, to ballot members
over performance-related pay, caused anger because it was felt this might be
seen as political activism.
This could undermine support from parents, which will be vital for teachers
if a compromise is not reached before June when the tests are due to take
place.
Cheers greeted a delegate who said: 'What's taking place elsewhere at other
conferences I think we should abhor. It's not tolerable to see this
profession, which we cherish, portrayed this way.'
Complaints about workload made up the bulk of conference speeches. Every
teacher had their own statistic.
Apart from the 8,085 pages of national curriculum documentation which Mr
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, presented to conference, delegates were
told that primary school teachers had to make 100 statements for every pupil
in each class, which, according to one delegate, meant 80 hours of work a
week.
A Socialist Workers party stall in the conference foyer was the strongest
evidence of leftwing infiltration.
But the stand facing it, where a life insurance company was selling
teachers' pensions, seemed to be doing a better trade.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher rekindles her old fire
over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher proved yesterday that she has not lost her political
touch.
However strong the private annoyance of ministers and however rationally
argued the public denunciation, the former prime minister's remarks on
Bosnia stirred Westminster into passionate debate over the role Britain
could play - and struck a chord with a surprising number of Labour and Tory
MPs.
'The unofficial view is that she has flipped - gone completely mad,' said
one MP ally of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. 'It was good Dog
and Duck stuff for a Friday afternoon in the pub.'
That was a careless assesment - although it was true that scarcely a Tory MP
was prepared to support Lady Thatcher's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be
armed and few had concrete alternatives to present government policy.
Government officials' attempts to pretend that Mr Rifkind's Commons
statement was planned were half-hearted. The government was clearly on the
defensive, anxious that her views should not become common currency or be
seen in the US as policy. The private scorn of loyal MPs, fed up with Lady
Thatcher's attacks on her successor as prime minister over Maastricht, was
coupled with an admission that her views chimed with swelling anxiety beyond
Westminster over Bosnia.
'Her comments have struck a chord with the public,' said a Tory MP who
fiercely opposes increasing Britain's military involvement. 'I had an old
man speaking at a meeting in my constituency who said 'I remember 1945 and
never thought that we would see the return of concentration camps.''
For Thatcherites, Lady Thatcher's outburst echoed her time as prime minister
when, at least in their minds, Britain was either totally involved in
overseas military operations, or not at all.
Lady Thatcher's intervention may have been clumsy. Her decision to grant
several interviews to television news programmes rather than make a
considered speech, allowed ministers to pick holes in her argument. But in
the Commons there was a growing 'something must be done' mentality that Mr
Rifkind at times struggled to contain.
'There is a ghastly parallel between the feebleness of the United Nations as
it now stands and the League of Nations some 60 years ago against
expansionism,' said Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for South Wirral.
'There is a real danger of being dragged into a far wider and more difficult
conflict unless some check is imposed on the Serbian-driven expansion,' said
Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee.
Reaction among some Labour MPs too was surprisingly strong; the condemnation
of inactivity by leftwing backbenchers more vociferous than the front bench.
Ms Clare Short, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, drew parallels between
the plight of Bosnian Moslems and the failure to protect Jews in the second
world war. Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, said the former
prime minister had articulated at least 'the deep anger and frustration of
people in this country'.
To an extent, Lady Thatcher was voicing the frustration of Tories wanting
firm leadership after a year dominated by rows. She has served warning that
ministers must work hard to hold the party together over Bosnia.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten moves to seize initiative
over controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday sought to regain the
initiative in the controversy over testing in schools by writing to all
Conservative MPs to explain why a boycott by teachers would damage the
prospect of further improvements to the government's education reforms,
Alison Smith writes.
In a letter to his colleagues, Mr Patten acknowledged that there were a
range of concerns among teachers, and he said that his announcement in
February of a review of testing and also of the national curriculum was in
response to those views.
That review would be hindered if there were no results available from this
year's tests for it to consider, he argued. This view had also been
emphasised by Sir Ron Dearing, who will chair the review.
Mr Patten said that the English tests for 14-year-olds, which are due to
start this summer, had been the subject of particular anxiety.
He accused the NUT and the NASUWT teachers' unions of exploiting concern
about those tests in their plans to boycott all the tests.
Opening his attack well in advance of the boycott itself, Mr Patten
described any such action as 'counter-productive and unnecessarily damaging,
including to the professional standing of teachers'.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Prison management's first rule
proves hard - Group 4's prisoner escort services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAIL systems throughout the world share a common first rule
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
hang on to the prisoners.
Officials of Britain's prison service will be anxious to ensure that Group
4, the private security company, is able to fulfil the rule when they meet
its managers today. The meeting has been called to review the inglorious
start last week to Group 4's handling of Britain's first private contract
for escorting prisoners between prisons and courts. Four men escaped or were
wrongly released within as many days.
There is more at stake in today's meeting than the usual embarrassment over
escapes. The government's ambition to extend private management to wide
areas of the criminal justice system depends on the private sector being
able to deliver a reliable service.
Group 4, one of the largest security organisations in the world, is at the
forefront of this. In addition to gaining the contract to escort prisoners
in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside it runs Wolds, the first
privately managed prison in the UK. And it is among this week's bidders to
manage Strangeways prison, Manchester. Security companies were natural
candidates when the government sought private-sector involvement in the
criminal justice system. But their established activities in cash delivery,
guard services and security patrols still left them short of the specific
expertise needed to run prison services. The new court escort service is
operated by 400 prison custody officers and support staff - recruited from
6,500 applicants since it was announced in November Group 4 had won the
contract.
Custody officers undergo a six-week training programme. Group 4 Court
Services' Nottinghamshire training centre contains a mock courtroom and
cells, and training is the responsibility of Mr John Bown, a former police
service head of training recruited by the company. Mr David Corbally,
quality manager responsible for maintaining performance standards on the
escort service, is another former senior police officer.
Group 4 has recruited some high-ranking staff from the public sector. Mr
Charles Erickson, a senior Home Office civil servant, and Mr Walter
MacGowan, a former governor of Strangeways, joined the company last year.
Group 4's director of the new prison escort contract is Mr Michael Hirst,
until January chief constable of Leicestershire.
'Bidding for government prison contracts is in line with our business
objective of remaining in security activities rather that diversifying,' Mr
Stephen Brown, managing director of Group 4 Total Security said yesterday.
'We needed the most experienced staff available to run prison and escort
services, and in Britain that expertise is in the public sector.'
Mr Brown says Group 4's line-up of senior staff with police and other
specialist experience demonstrates that it has the necessary skills
necessary to deliver the court escort service. The company blames deficient
design of vehicles, built to Home Office specifications, for two of last
week's escapes and says a third man was released on the order of the court.
'There was always a possibility of complications in taking over a complete,
complex contract on a single day.' said Mr Brown. 'But it should be
remembered that since Group 4 started managing Wolds prison a year ago we
have been responsible for escorting prisoners between Wolds and the courts.
We have handled 8,000 movements in a year without incident.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Morris warning on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPUTY speaker chairing the detailed discussion of the Maastricht bill
last night warned the government it could face a vote of no confidence if it
ignores MPs' demands over the treaty's social chapter.
Speaking on BBC 2's Westminster Live programme, Mr Michael Morris
acknowledged the government could ignore a vote in favour of a proposed
Labour new clause but said 'all sorts of things could flow - votes of
confidence et cetera' if it did so.
Mr Morris selected the new clause - which would prevent powers being
transferred under the bill until MPs had decided whether the social chapter
should apply to the UK - in a ruling last month.
At the same time he announced there would be no vote on a separate and
potentially crucial Labour amendment that would remove the protocol
containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter.
But with the bill due to return to the Commons today, Mr Morris was last
night under intense cross-party pressure to reconsider this decision. During
a 30-minute meeting in Mr Morris's chambers, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow
foreign secretary, pleaded the case for allowing a vote either during the
current committee stage or the subsequent report stage.
If the deputy speaker reversed his decision by allowing a vote while the
bill is in committee, the division - which could deal a severe blow to the
government - would probably come later tonight.
Mr Morris made clear he would listen to MPs' views regarding his ruling: 'It
may be that I have missed some aspect, in which case I will take it very
very seriously.'
There were rumours last night that Tory Euro-sceptics might attempt to call
a vote of no confidence in Mr Morris if he confirmed no vote on the
amendment would be allowed.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Teachers give strong backing to
test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second-largest teaching union, the NASUWT, yesterday underlined its
commitment to boycotting all tests for assessing pupils on the national
curriculum.
Delegates to its annual conference in Bournemouth unanimously endorsed a
motion upholding the total boycott which the union had already announced.
The motion stated that 'the resentment of teachers against their existing
heavy workload' would be 'greatly exacerbated by the miserable salary award
made to teachers for 1992-93'.
The confirmation of the boycott on tests adds to the pressure on the
government to abandon the tests for this year. The move follows votes last
week by the other two leading teachers' unions, the NUT and the ATL, to
ballot members on similar action.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, yesterday stepped up the
union's opposition to the government's education reforms when he produced a
pile of documents for the national curriculum which he said ran to 8,085
pages.
He told the conference: 'I don't know what more evidence we have to present
to the world that the system is fundamentally flawed and that Mr Patten must
act not next year but now.'
The leadership, however, suffered a defeat on the issue of school league
tables and examination results at the hands of its delegates who voted for a
harder line.
The executive was defeated when delegates declined to back a commitment to
present strong alternative league tables to the Department for Education -
which would have taken additional factors into account - in favour of
outright opposition to league tables.
There was applause when one delegate told the conference that co-operating
with the tables would mean 'giving future league tables the legitimacy now
denied to them by almost every leading commentator'.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'One-stop' business centres
finalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has decided on the locations of 16 pilot 'one-stop' business
advice centres which will form the core of a national network of 200
'one-stop shops'. A disproportionately large number are in north-west
England and the Midlands.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to announce
the names of six areas which have successfully tendered to operate a
'one-stop shop', and nine which will be granted official recognition if they
modify their business plans and a special case - central London - which will
receive additional funds for further development.
Bids for 'one-stop shop' status were made by 57 partnerships of local
business support organisations headed by Training and Enterprise Councils -
which administer government training schemes in England and Wales - and
comprising chambers of commerce, enterprise agency and local authority
economic development departments. From these, 20 were shortlisted, of which
16 have been selected.
The six areas awarded one-stop shops are south and east Cheshire,
Manchester, Birmingham, Hertfordshire, Tyneside, and Warrington.
The nine areas which will qualify if they carry out further work on their
proposals are Chester and the Wirral, south Derbyshire, Shropshire,
Merseyside, Hereford and Worcestershire, Doncaster, Leicestershire, Surrey,
and Dorset.
The bias towards the north-west and the Midlands reflects the preponderance
of bids from those areas in response to the original tender announcement
last December.
In some areas the 'one-stop shops' will be set up in areas with strong
existing business support networks such as Manchester and Birmingham. In
other areas such as Surrey and Hertfordshire they will be established in
areas with fragmented support networks.
In central London, Mr Heseltine has accepted a provisional combined bid from
four Tecs - Central London, City &amp; Inner London, South Thames and London
East. A bid from Aztec, covering Kingston and Wandsworth, was rejected but
it was advised to combine with the four other Tecs.
These five London Tecs, the London and Westminster chambers of commerce and
the London Enterprise Agency, are to carry out a Pounds 500,000 study,
part-funded by the government, aimed at establishing a central London
'one-stop shop' linked to satellite advice centres in the outer boroughs.
The central London bid was complicated by the large number of business
support organisations including nine Tecs, more than 30 chambers of commerce
and about 25 enterprise agencies.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke to hear City on insider
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the home secretary, last night promised further
consultations with the Stock Exchange and other City authorities to ensure
that more stringent curbs on insider dealing do not inhibit legitimate
trading processes.
He told the Commons that Treasury ministers handling the Criminal Justice
Bill believed they could allay fears that normal practices based on
expertise might be affected.
Mr Robert Maclennan for the Liberal Democrats led protests that City
interests and the CBI had not been adequately consulted before the bill was
given a second reading by the Lords last November.
Mr Clarke acknowledged the difficulties experienced in mounting successful
prosecutions under the existing law and stressed the importance of ensuring
that the new provisions were correctly drafted so that the law could be
effectively enforced.
Insisting that legitimate business practices would not be jeopardised, he
said: 'Nothing in the bill will prevent the sort of contact between
companies and investors which properly take place today.'
Nor would it require changes to the legitimate practices of investment
analysts, or involve any modification of underwriting arrangements.
Mr Clarke confirmed that it would continue to be an offence for an insider
who possessed inside information or someone who had obtained information
from an insider to take advantage of it by dealing in securities to make a
profit or avoid a loss.
Mr Clarke said the new legislation would apply to all listed securities, and
to all securities which were traded on exchanges throughout the EC, rather
than just those which operated in the UK.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said nothing in the
bill would prevent meetings between companies and institutional investors,
or occasional meetings with analysts.
The bill was given an unopposed second reading.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Newbury ballot tied to council
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government set the stage yesterday for the most important test of its
popularity since last year's general election by announcing that the Newbury
by-election will be held on May 6.
The date for the by-election, where the Conservatives face a powerful
challenge from the Liberal Democrats to their 12,357 majority, has been
chosen to coincide with the county council elections. The reasoning in
Conservative Central Office is that the impact of a defeat might be
cushioned by a stronger performance in the local polls.
Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives were being careful
yesterday not to overstate their confidence of winning the seat. Senior
officials on both sides said privately that they regarded the result as 'too
close to call'.
Newbury has traditionally been regarded as part of the Conservatives' home
counties heartlands, but the recession has severely eroded support for the
government. The Liberal Democrats also have a strong presence on the
Berkshire county council where their support ensures a Labour
administration.
The poll, caused by the death of Mrs Judith Chaplin, is regarded by the
Liberal Democrat party as a key test of its ability to re-establish its
political profile after a lacklustre year.
The 9.3 per cent swing it needs to win the seat is well within the margin of
its by-election victories during the last parliament. Labour, which polled
fewer than 4,000 votes in the constituency last April, is not regarded as a
serious contender.
For Mr John Major the stakes are still higher. Apart from the obvious
psychological blow, a defeat would reduce the government's Commons majority
from 21 to 19. With several Tory MPs now 'semi-detached' from the government
as a result of the row over Maastricht, its 'reliable' majority on many
issues is already in single figures.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, who yesterday launched his party's campaign for the local
elections with a prediction that it would win a record number of seats, said
Newbury had the opportunity to 'speak for Britain' in rejecting the
government's policies.
Mr Ashdown rejected Conservative charges that his party had established
informal pacts with Labour, insisting that no deals had been struck at local
or at national level.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that he
had asked for a report on the withdrawal of some Labour candidates in
Berkshire in an apparent attempt to help the Liberal Democrats.
Prospective candidates named for the by-election so far: Julian Davidson
(C), David Rendel (Lib Dem), Steve Billcliffe (Lab), Jim Wallis (Green), Dr
Alan Sked (Anti-Federalist), Colin Palmer (21st Century party), Lord David
Sutch (Monster Raving Loony 30 Years party).
General election result, April 1992: Mrs Chaplin (C) 37,135; David Rendel
(Liberal Democrat) 24,778; Richard Hall (Lab) 3,962; Jim Wallis (Green) 539.
Unemployment has risen five times faster in Conservative-controlled counties
than in their Labour counterparts, Labour claimed yesterday in its local
election campaign.
Launching a survey on the 'success' of Labour councils in protecting
companies and jobs, Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief Treasury secretary,
said that Labour had promoted economic development and attracted inward
investment.
Labour said the jobless total in the last four years had risen 193 per cent
in Tory-controlled counties against an average of 37 per cent in counties
under Labour control.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht 'chaos' rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS HIT out yesterday at the 'chaotic' state of affairs that has left them
ignorant of which amendments to the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty
they will be asked to vote on when they conclude detailed consideration of
clause one of the bill, probably tonight.
On the eve of the measure's return to the Commons, Mr Peter Shore, the
veteran Labour Euro-sceptic, called on Mr Michael Morris, deputy speaker, to
clarify the position as early as possible when today's debate gets under
way.
Mr Shore was supported by Mr Nigel Spearing, another Euro-sceptic Labour MP.
Mr Shore said he would be adding his voice to cross-party calls for Mr
Morris to reconsider a decision not to allow a vote on Labour's potentially
crucial amendment 27 - which would remove the protocol containing Britain's
opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was last night due to see Mr
Morris in person to plead the case for allowing a vote.
If the deputy speaker does reverse his decision, the vote - which could deal
a severe blow to the government - would probably come later tonight.
If he sticks to his guns, there would be a vote on a separate Labour clause
to prevent powers being transferred under the bill until MPs had decided
whether the social chapter should apply to the UK.
There were rumours last night that disgruntled Tory Euro-sceptics might
attempt to call a vote of no confidence in Mr Morris if he confirmed that no
vote on amendment 27 would be allowed. Hard-core Tory rebels were expected
to meet to discuss tactics today before the committee stage resumed.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: InterCity turns trains to hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERCITY is taking steps to earn at least some revenue during tomorrow's
planned 24-hour rail strike, Roy Terry writes.
Rather than see its fleet of 125 Pullmans standing idle at Paddington
station, InterCity is offering sleeper accommodation for commuters tonight
and tomorrow. The cost is Pounds 20 a night for a shared cabin and Pounds 30
a night for a single cabin.
In addition, a full first class Pullman dining service is available from
8pm. Weary travellers or, in this case, non-travellers, may retire to their
sleeper berths at 9.30pm.
They will be awakened with a BR coffee.
InterCity said: 'We are trying to give something back to our customers in
difficult circumstances by offering a service to meet a known demand.'
There have been some bookings, and BR expects many more. A similar service
at Euston and King's Cross in previous years proved very popular. Bookings
can be made by calling 071 922 6766.

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Trouble with the first rule of
prison management - The shaky start to Group 4's prisoner escort services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRISON systems throughout the world share a common first rule
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
hang on to the prisoners.
Officials of Britain's prison service will be anxious to ensure that Group
4, the private security company, is able to fulfil the rule when they meet
its managers today. The meeting has been called to review the inglorious
start last week to Group 4's handling of Britain's first private contract
for escorting prisoners between prisons and courts. Four men escaped or were
wrongly released within as many days.
There is more at stake in today's meeting than the usual political
embarrassment over escapes. The government's ambition to extend private
management to wide areas of the criminal justice system - offering valuable
business opportunities for security companies - depends on the private
sector being able to deliver a reliable service.
Group 4, one of the largest private security organisations in the world, is
at the forefront of this. In addition to gaining the contract to escort
prisoners in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside it already runs
Wolds, the first privately-managed prison in the UK. And it is among this
week's bidders to manage Strangeways prison, Manchester. Dutch-based Group 4
Securitas has 32,000 employees worldwide - 8,000 of them in the UK - and
operates in 33 countries.
Security companies were natural candidates when the government sought
private-sector involvement in the criminal justice system. But their
established activities in cash delivery, guard services and security patrols
still left them short of the specific expertise needed to run prison
services.
The new court escort service is operated by 400 prison custody officers and
support staff - recruited from 6,500 applicants since it was announced in
November that Group 4 had won the five-year contract. Between 20 per cent
and 30 per cent of the successful applicants had previous experience in the
prison service, police or armed services.
Custody officers undergo a six-week training programme, ranging from routine
duties to handling emergencies and restraint techniques. Group 4 Court
Services' Nottinghamshire training centre contains a mock courtroom and
cells, and training is the responsibility of Mr John Bown, a former police
service head of training recruited by the company. Mr David Corbally,
quality manager responsible for maintaining performance standards on the
escort service, is another former senior police officer.
Group 4 has recruited some high-ranking staff from the public sector. Mr
Charles Erickson, a senior Home Office civil servant, and Mr Walter
MacGowan, a former governor of Strangeways, joined the company last year.
Group 4's director of the new prison escort contract is Mr Michael Hirst,
until January chief constable of Leicestershire, and his two senior
controllers are former chief superintendents.
'Bidding for government prison contracts is in line with our business
objective of remaining in security activities rather that diversifying,' Mr
Stephen Brown, managing director of Group 4 Total Security said yesterday.
'We needed the most experienced staff available to run prison and escort
services, and in Britain that expertise is in the public sector.'
'But we have not gone out to poach or headhunt public sector managers. We
regularly receive approaches from people in the public sector who are
interested in joining us.'
Mr Brown says Group 4's line-up of senior staff with police and other
specialist experience demonstrates that it has the necessary skills
necessary to deliver the court escort service. The company blames deficient
design of vehicles, built to Home Office specifications, for two of last
week's escapes and says a third man was released on the order of the court.
He added: 'There was always a possibility of complications in taking over a
complete, complex contract on a single day.' said Mr Brown. 'But it should
be remembered that since Group 4 started managing Wolds prison a year ago we
have been responsible for escorting prisoners between Wolds and the courts.
We have handled 8,000 movements in a year without incident.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour claims success on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT has risen five times faster in Conservative-controlled counties
than their Labour counterparts, Labour claimed yesterday as it opened a
fresh line of attack in its local election campaign, David Owen writes.
Launching a survey on the 'success' of Labour councils in protecting
companies and jobs, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said
Labour had promoted economic development despite 'disastrous' Tory economic
mismanagement.
Labour said the jobless total in the last four years had risen by 193 per
cent in Tory-controlled counties against an average of 37 per cent in Labour
counties.
The party also used a mid-campaign press conference and a party political
broadcast to reinforce its principal election message that Labour councils
provided better services and cost local taxpayers less.
Labour claims that average council tax bills under Labour councils were
Pounds 14 less than under Tory councils.

FT  15 APR 93 / Record N Sea oil output forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRODUCTION by the main countries involved in the North Sea will reach a
record level of nearly 5.5m barrels per day in 1995 - a 41 per cent increase
on 1991 - according to a report from Mackay Consultants, oil industry
analysts.
Mackay says output from new oil fields coming onstream mainly in the UK and
Norway sectors will more than compensate for declining production in some of
the older fields.
Mr David Rennie and Mr Tony Mackay say the expected increase is a result of
a high level of development work over the last five years. They do not
expect a continuing rise after 1995 because the level of such activity is
much lower.
In their report, Prospects for the North Sea Oil and Gas Industry 1993-95,
they say a significant factor in the UK will be the oil industry's reaction
to tax changes in last month's Budget, which they expect to lead to a
further contraction in exploration drilling.
They admit their prediction that UK oil production will peak at 2.5m barrels
a day in 1995, to be followed by a slow decline, is in marked contrast to
other experts who forecast continuing growth for the rest of the decade.

FT  15 APR 93 / Call to cut prices of CDs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSUMERS' Association last night call for restrictions on imports of
cheaper compact discs from the US to be lifted and the savings passed on CD
buyers.
The association is to give evidence today to the first hearing in the
Commons national heritage committee's investigation of CD prices. Last night
it produced a list of discs with UK prices higher than those in the US.
The MPs will also be hearing evidence from rock groups which are demanding
lower prices for their own CDs. WH Smith, Britain's biggest record retailer,
will present evidence on April 22.
Mr Derek Prentice, Consumers' Association assistant director said: 'CDs are
a rip-off. CD buyers in the UK are a small-scale, high-profit, largely
captive market. Exchange rates and other factors cannot explain the
persistent gap between the cost of CDs in the UK and US.'
The association called on the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the
'possibly anti-competitive effects' of the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988, which it said was used to block imports.
The British Phonographic Industry said that although it might cost just
Pounds 1 to manufacture the disc, other expenses such as copyright fees,
recording sessions and cover designs added to the cost.

FT  15 APR 93 / Industry beats off radical plans: Tackling market power of
dominant companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's decision to do little more than tinker with the present
legislation for tackling abuse of market power by dominant companies
represents a significant victory for the industry lobby.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, was quick to deny yesterday
there had been a government climbdown. It had not 'caved in to industry', he
said. But the decision will come as a severe disappointment to businesses
used to competing with a dominant player in the market to consumer
organisations and to competition lawyers who had all argued for radical
reform.
But in general industry will welcome yesterday's announcement. The
Confederation of British Industry, after extensive consultation with its
members, strongly opposed radical change. It told the Department of Trade
and Industry: 'If-it-ain't-bust-don't-fix-it.' Radical change was
unnecessary and would be very costly for industry, it argued.
In the November green paper the government canvassed three options for
reform:
To retain the existing case-by-case approach under the 1973 Fair Trading Act
and the 1980 Competition Act for dealing with anti-competitive practices.
Under this option the Office of Fair Trading would have been given stronger
investigatory powers and businesses would be made liable for damages and
possible civil penalties for continuing abuse.
To introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power based on Article
86 of the Rome Treaty backed by tough investigatory powers for the OFT and
fines on companies of up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover.
To introduce a general prohibition backed up by fines of up to 10 per cent
of worldwide turnover and give the OFT tough investigatory powers, but
retain the existing Fair Trading Act provisions for investigating
monopolies.
At the time of publication the government was thought to prefer option
three, seen as the best chance of an effective deterrent while retaining the
breadth and flexibility of the existing legislation.
Mr Hamilton said yesterday the government had approached the issue with an
open mind. There had been no consensus among respondents to the green paper
and the government had 'concluded that the regulatory costs which would have
arisen from options two and three would have been disproportionate to the
gains to consumers.'
The government now proposes to strengthen legislation in four ways: wider
powers of investigation for the Office of Fair Trading allowing it to search
and seize documents in certain circumstances; additional scope for companies
to give undertakings to the OFT which can be enforced through the courts;
power for the director-general of fair trading to make interim orders
prohibiting any further anti-competitive behaviour; and extension of the law
to cover some property rights, such as rights of access.
The government, however, has dropped the proposal to make companies liable
for penalties and damages for continuing abuse. Mr Hamilton said a number of
respondents had argued this would be unjust and might lead a company to
abandon a practice that was later found not to be against the public
interest.

FT  15 APR 93 / Building societies look for security in their funding: The
reasons why mortgage lenders are considering a fresh method of raising
finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE years ago the concept of repackaging mortgages for sale as securities
was anathema to most building societies.
Now, many societies are preparing the ground so that they will be ready to
securitise their mortgages, if the need arises. The Leeds Permanent building
society may go ahead as early as September, and other societies, such as
Nationwide and Bristol &amp; West, are making adjustments to their computer and
administrative systems to ensure that they can cope with the logistics of
securitisation.
So what lies behind this change of heart? Not, as in the case of some
foreign banks, the need for capital. Securitisation allows financial
institutions to remove assets from their balance sheets, reducing the amount
of capital they have to hold for regulatory purposes. But the constraints
facing building societies have actually diminished in recent years.
The real reason for the change is that societies have become increasingly
worried about their ability to meet their funding needs through traditional
channels when the housing market starts to improve.
During the housing boom of the late 1980s, centralised mortgage lenders,
such as The Mortgage Corporation, were able to win market share using
securitisation as their main method of funding.
At present building societies have two main sources of funds, and both
appear constrained. The most important is retail deposit accounts, but
falling interest rates have prompted a withdrawal of funds. The other
mainstay is the wholesale market, where building societies can raise up to
40 per cent of their funding, under Building Societies Commission rules,
through bonds and loans.
In practice, however, the average limit, dictated by the BSC on an
individual basis, is closer to 20 per cent, and many building societies are
already approaching their limits.
'Any society in the top 20 that is wholesale-funded up to 25 per cent or
more must be looking at the prospect of securitisation out of necessity,'
said Mr Simon White, assistant treasurer at the Halifax building society,
which has only 15 per cent wholesale funding.
Any increase in deposit rates, in order to attract more retail funds, would
squeeze building societies' margins - or push up mortgage rates.
Securitisation is off-balance sheet financing, which does not count towards
the 40 per cent funding rule, and allows building societies to lock in a
profit margin.
At present there is a differential of about 2 percentage points between
Libor (the London interbank offer rate, the main reference for wholesale
funding) and the mortgage rate. If building societies were able to finance
securitised mortgages at, say,  3/4 of a point above Libor, they would still
have locked in a margin of more than a point.
Securitisation has other advantages: the maturity of mortgage-backed
securities is matched with the life of the mortgage, so that, unlike other
types of funding, it does not leave building societies with any exposure
when refinancing is necessary.
Clearing banks are also looking at securitisation, but only Barclays Bank
plans to securitise both mortgages and two to five-year consumer loans this
year. It is 'highly likely' that the bank will securitise about Pounds 300m
of mortgages this year, according to Mr Brian Worsley, deputy treasurer.
Apart from Barclays, which already securitised one batch of mortgages four
years ago, building societies are expected to lead the way. But for all its
theoretical attractions, some societies such as the Halifax and Alliance &amp;
Leicester do not believe that securitisation is commercially viable for
them.
The start-up costs are extremely high - one Swedish bank is estimated to
have spent Dollars 1m on its first issue of mortgage-backed securities.
When mortgage-backed financing was first introduced in the US, the result
was cheaper housing finance in some areas as the available pool of mortgage
funding was spread more evenly. Even the most optimistic observers see
little prospect of any benefits to homebuyers here. At best it may provide
'a new source of funding at levels not significantly higher than . . in the
wholesale market,' according to Mr Mark Stadler, director in charge of
securitisation at Merrill Lynch.
All the same, if the long-awaited recovery in house prices finally
materialises in the next year or so, at least the building societies will be
ready, and able, to lend.

FT  15 APR 93 / European Bank of Reconstruction and Development loans to be
investigated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO cross-party Commons committees are likely to investigate the spending
and loans of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and whether
the UK government exercised sufficient care in preventing its Pounds 40m
grant to the bank being misspent.
Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the public accounts committee,
described the bank's expenditure as 'quite astonishing'. He is planning to
ask the comptroller and auditor-general, Sir John Bourn, whether the
spending of the UK's Pounds 40m grant - given to the bank as an incentive to
locate in London - was suitable for investigation.
He said examination of the Common Agricultural Policy provided a precedent
for examining whether the government had taken appropriate steps to ensure
that a contribution to a European institution had been spent wisely.
Meanwhile, Mr Giles Radice, a Labour member of the Treasury and Civil
Service committee, said the committee had agreed yesterday that it would
'look at how effectively the bank is lending money in Eastern Europe'.
To date the bank has disbursed just Pounds 101m.

FT  15 APR 93 / Further twist in war over air fares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, one of Britain's biggest travel agents, gave a new twist to the
war over business air fares yesterday by offering yet bigger savings to its
corporate clients in exchange for a fee.
Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director, suggested that savings of up
to 40 per cent were possible on corporate travel. However this would eat
into the agency's traditional income, derived from a 9 per cent commission
on the price of an air ticket.
Following similar plans in the US, Thomas Cook is also offering to manage
corporate travel spending. It wants to bypass companies' in-house travel
managers and provide spending reports directly to budget holders.
American Express, one of Thomas Cook's rivals, said that it was already
offering similar cost-management services to corporate clients.

FT  15 APR 93 / Talks on sale of Leyland Daf plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE management buy-out team seeking to acquire the Leyland Daf truck
assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, has started formal negotiations with
the administrative receivers, Kevin Done writes.
Mr John Gilchrist, who is leading the buy-out team, said yesterday 'a number
of offers of funding support' had been received from leading financial
institutions.
The MBO team has received a letter of intent from Daf Trucks in the
Netherlands for the supply of its UK-built range of Leyland Daf light trucks
to the Dutch company's European dealer network.
The management buy-out team is also negotiating with the receivers on behalf
of Lancashire County Council, which is seeking to acquire the entire Leyland
site for development into a business and high technology park.
The MBO team is seeking to secure the use of the truck assembly plant
itself, but the remainder of the 230-acre site includes a range of other
industrial buildings, including the Leyland components plant and Leyland Daf
headquarters building.
Mr Gilchrist said the bid from the management buy-out team was in its 'final
stages'. Negotiations were expected to continue for several days, but it was
hoped a final agreement could be reached by the end of the month.
The future ownership of the former African subsidiaries of Leyland Daf, the
subject of separate management buy-out negotiations, was 'not in any way
critical' to the success of the Leyland MBO team's bid, Mr Gilchrist said.
Automotive Products, the automotive components maker, which has stopped
supplying brakes and clutches to Leyland Daf pending the repayment of debts
totalling Pounds 758,000, said last night it was 'on the verge' of
completing an agreement with the Leyland truck MBO team to resume supplies
of clutches, if the buy-out bid succeeded.

FT  15 APR 93 / Car design company goes into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent

<TEXT>
IAD (UK), one of Europe's leading automotive design and engineering
consultancies, has been forced into administrative receivership with debts
of about Pounds 13.5m.
Mr Maurice Withall and Mr Peter Flesher of accountants Grant Thornton have
been appointed joint administrative receivers. Mr Withall said last night
that offers for IAD had been received from several companies and a sale
could be completed before the end of next week.
'We are very hopeful and expect to be successful in selling the business as
a going concern,' he said.
Mr Godfrey Harker, IAD group finance director, said the company's debts
included bank debt of Pounds 7m, trade debt of Pounds 4m and Pounds 2.5m
owed to the Inland Revenue. It expected to make a loss of Pounds 2m to
Pounds 2.5m on a turnover of up to Pounds 52m in the year to the end of this
month. Turnover had begun to fall sharply since mid-1992.
The company had been profitable until halfway through the present financial
year, but turnover had declined significantly from about Pounds 60m achieved
in both the previous two years. The strain on IAD's finances was increased
by the financial collapse in February of Daf, the Dutch truck maker, which
owed IAD around Pounds 500,000.
International Automotive Design, based at Worthing, West Sussex, has carried
out contracts for many of the world's leading vehicle makers since it was
formed in 1976 by Mr John Shute. The company is owned 77.5 per cent by Mr
Shute and his family, and 22.5 per cent by Cinven, the UK's second largest
venture capital investor.
The company, which won three Queen's awards for exports in the late 1980s,
has established a presence in most of the leading car producing countries
with subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain and the US and liaison offices
in Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow.
It has played a leading role in the design and prototype development of a
wide range of vehicles including the Ford Scorpio estate car, Ford's Lincoln
Town Car in the US, the Volvo 440 and the Mazda MX-5 sports car. It has
played a leading role in the development of electric vehicles and recently
won a substantial design and development contract from Telco, the large
Indian commercial vehicle maker.
The IAD group has a workforce of close to 1,000 worldwide, including a large
number of independent consultants working under contract. The company
employs just under 300 in the UK mainly at its Worthing headquarters.
Only the UK parent company and five UK subsidiaries have been placed in
receivership.
Mr Harker said last night: 'It is the back end of the recession catching us.
We had been looking for additional capital for a little while and had been
trying to interest the venture capital market, but falling turnover did not
help.'
Under Mr Shute's forceful leadership IAD has been built into the UK's
leading automotive design and engineering consultancy. Its concept vehicles
have been exhibited at many of the world's leading international motor
shows, and the company had started to rival many of the long-established
Italian automotive design houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign and
Bertone.

FT  15 APR 93 / EBRD staff told to fly economy class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the furore over the use of private jets by Mr Jacques Attali, president
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank disclosed
yesterday that all other staff have been instructed to fly economy class.
There are only two exceptions to the rule: Mr Attali and Mr Ron Freeman, the
first vice president. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the EBRD's budget director, said
the ban on business class flights was made five weeks ago. Mr Attali and Mr
Freeman were exempted because it is in their contracts, Mr Pissaloux said.
Mr Pissaloux also said that 'a few months ago' he introduced a new system
for controlling the costs of hiring jets for Mr Attali. The new system means
that each time Mr Attali needs an aircraft, three charter companies are
asked to submit bids. Mr Pissaloux said this was not a direct response to
pressure from the bank's board of governors, though one of those governors,
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said yesterday the governors had become
concerned about the costs of the private airplanes.
Mr Pissaloux added that each three months he informs the chairman of the
bank's audit committee, which consists of representatives of the countries
which own the bank, how much Mr Attali has spent on jets and other items in
the previous quarter. 'We desire to be entirely transparent,' Mr Pissaloux
said.
Mr Attali, who is facing mounting criticism over internal spending at the
bank, said in a recent interview it would be impossible for him to do his
job without the use of private jets.
'I am sorry, I cannot do without it', he said. Such aircraft were needed, he
claimed, for trips which were incompatible with commercial airline
schedules.
He gave an example of his schedule from 25 March to 29 March, when he flew
from a meeting with the Prince of Wales, who was inaugurating the bank's
head office, to Bucharest in Romania, for an environmental meeting. Then he
went to Paris and from there to Hamburg. Finally he flew to Moscow where he
had breakfast on the 29th with Mr Boris Federov, the Russian deputy prime
minister.
Mr Pissaloux insisted that private jets could sometimes work out cheaper
than flying in a commercial aircraft, when large numbers of bank executives
needed to be travelling together.
The EBRD spent Pounds 600,000 on renting private aircraft last year and is
budgeting to spend up to Pounds 400,000 this year for between 15 and 18
trips - roughly Pounds 22,000 for each use of a jet.
Aircraft brokers said yesterday that even a small Learjet, seating three or
four people comfortably, would cost around Pounds 2,000 an hour to charter.
The bank recently called for tender offers for a chartered Learjet from at
least one London area air charterer.
It also wanted details on the British Aerospace 125 jet, which can carry six
or seven people in luxury but costs about Pounds 3,000 an hour to charter.
One air broker yesterday described the BAe 125 as 'the Rolls-Royce of
private aircraft' and the Learjet as 'the Mercedes'.
Private jet charter is a business that thrives on secrecy as much as
economics. Corporate dealmakers like to own or charter private jets to
conceal their movements from potential rivals who may monitor the public
areas of airports.
Mr Brian Wigham of consultancy, International Bureau of Aviation, says that
private charterers buy 'convenience and security'.
Luton is one of the biggest centres of private jet chartering in the UK,
followed by Heathrow, Gatwick and Biggin Hill, Kent.

FT  15 APR 93 / N Sea oil rig workers evacuated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 30 oil workers were evacuated from a North Sea platform last night
after it was hit by a power failure.
Oil company Amoco said they were airlifting non-essential personnel from the
Montrose Alpha platform, about 130 miles east of Aberdeen.
The Aberdeen coastguard said no-one was understood to have been injured and
the platform, which is permanently secured to the sea-bed, was in no danger.
The coastguard added: 'We don't know why there was a power failure. There's
no danger of the platform drifting anywhere, but the loss of power means
that communications are difficult.'
Oil production by the main countries involved in the North Sea will reach a
record level of nearly 5.5m barrels per day in 1995 - a 41 per cent increase
on 1991 - according to a report from Mackay Consultants, oil industry
analysts.
Mackay says output from new oil fields coming on-stream mainly in the UK and
Norway sectors will more than compensate for declining production in some of
the older fields.
In their report, Prospects for the North Sea Oil and Gas Industry 1993-95,
Mr David Rennie and Mr Tony Mackay say the expected increase is a result of
a high level of development work over the last five years. They do not
expect a continuing rise after 1995 because the level of such activity is
much lower.

FT  15 APR 93 / Businessmen give conduct pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading has received written undertakings from two
businessmen involved in the collapsed Club Riviera timeshare company that
they will abide by various consumer protection laws.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the OFT, said yesterday that the
future conduct under the Fair Trading Act of Mr Simon Clarke and Mr Lawrence
Werner would be 'carefully' monitored.
Club Riviera was compulsorily wound up in the High Court on February 3 this
year. In July last year the OFT revoked the company's consumer credit
licences, the first time the OFT had taken such action against a timeshare
company.
Sir Bryan said yesterday that if Mr Werner or Mr Clarke failed to abide by
their undertakings the matter could be taken before the courts, with
ultimately the threat of a fine or imprisonment.
The OFT has invoked part three of the Fair Trading Act, which empowers Sir
Bryan to require written assurances from company executives to desist from
apparent breaches of a wide range of civil and criminal laws.
Among the offences that Mr Werner and Mr Clarke have agreed to refrain from
committing are: making false or misleading statements regarding services,
accommodation and facilities, or which induce consumers into entering
contracts; sending threatening letters; retaining consumers' money paid in
error; failing to return deposits; and obtaining property by deception.

PLANS FOR a shark tank at London's Planet Hollywood restaurant have been
scrapped after architects found the fish too unreliable, Rhodri Davies
writes.
The theme restaurant (shown left in design and under construction) is due to
open in the West End on May 17. It will have exhibits from films Terminator
2 and Rocky and the handcuffs from 9 1/2 Weeks, but architects Blair
Eastwick abandoned plans for a live shark exhibit. Partner Michael Eastwick
said: 'Baby sharks cost a small fortune and you have no guarantee of an
extended lifetime with those fish.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Talks on sale of Leyland Daf plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE management buy-out team seeking to acquire the Leyland Daf truck
assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, has started formal negotiations with
the administrative receivers.
Mr John Gilchrist, who is leading the buy-out team, said yesterday 'a number
of offers of funding support' had been received from leading financial
institutions.
Crucially the MBO team has also received a letter of intent from Daf Trucks
in the Netherlands for the supply of its UK-built range of Leyland Daf light
trucks to the Dutch company's European dealer network.
The management buy-out team is also negotiating with the receivers on behalf
of Lancashire County Council, which is seeking to acquire the entire Leyland
site for development by Lancashire Enterprises, its economic development
agency, into a business and high technology park.
The MBO team is seeking to secure the use of the truck assembly plant
itself, but the remainder of the 230 acre site includes a range of other
industrial buildings, including the Leyland components plant and Leyland Daf
headquarters building, Lancaster House.
Mr Gilchrist said the joint bid would give the truck business 'a future' and
contribute to the regeneration of the Leyland site.
The bid from the management buy-out team was in its 'final stages'.
Negotiations were expected to continue for several days, but it was hoped a
final agreement could be reached by the end of the month.
The future ownership of the former African subsidiaries of Leyland Daf, the
subject of separate management buy-out negotiations, was 'not in any way
critical' to the success of the Leyland MBO team's bid, said Mr Gilchrist.
Automotive Products, the automotive components maker, which has stopped
supplying brakes and clutches to Leyland Daf pending the repayment of debts
totalling Pounds 758,000, said last night it was 'on the verge' of
completing an agreement with the Leyland truck MBO team to resume supplies
of clutches, if the buy-out bid succeeded.

FT  15 APR 93 / Pilot 'one-stop' business advice centres chosen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has decided on the locations of 16 pilot 'one-stop' business
advice centres which will form the core of a national network of 200
'one-stop shops'. A disproportionately large number are in north-west
England and the Midlands.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to announce
the names of six areas which have successfully tendered to operate a
'one-stop shop', nine which will be granted official recognition if they
modify their business plans and a special case, central London, which will
receive additional funds to carry out further development work.
Bids for 'one-stop shop' status were made by 57 partnerships of local
business support organisations headed by Training and Enterprise Councils -
which administer government training schemes in England and Wales - and
comprising chambers of commerce, enterprise agency and local authority
economic development departments. These were whittled down to a shortlist of
20 from which 16 have now been selected.
The six areas awarded one-stop shops are south and east Cheshire,
Manchester, Birmingham, Hertfordshire, Tyneside and Warrington.
The nine areas which will qualify if they carry out further work on their
proposals are Chester and the Wirral, south Derbyshire, Shropshire,
Merseyside, Hereford and Worcestershire, Doncaster, Leicestershire, Surrey,
and Dorset.
The bias towards the north-west and the Midlands reflects the preponderance
of bids from those areas in response to the original tender announcement
last December.
In some areas the 'one-stop shops' will be set up in areas with strong
existing business support networks such as Manchester and Birmingham. In
other areas such as Surrey and Hertfordshire they will be established in
areas with fragmented support networks.
In central London, Mr Heseltine has accepted a provisional combined bid from
four Tecs - Central London, City &amp; Inner London, South Thames and London
East. A separate bid from Aztec, covering Kingston and Wandsworth, has been
rejected but it has been advised to combine with the four other Tecs.
These five London Tecs, the London and Westminster chambers of commerce and
the London Enterprise Agency, are to carry out a Pounds 500,000 study,
part-funded by the government, aimed at establishing a central London
one-stop shop linked to satellite advice centres in the outer boroughs.
The central London bid was complicated by the large number of business
support organisations including nine Tecs, more than 30 chambers of commerce
and about 25 enterprise agencies, and further research needs to be done.
The aim is to create a national network of business advice centres to equal
the government-backed chambers of commerce in much of continental Europe and
to end the fragmentation of support services for business.
The Tecs are free to establish their own business centres outside the
'one-stop shop' network but official recognition guarantees government
finance of about Pounds 230,000 in the first year and continuing government
backing for the next two years. Ultimately the 'one-stop shops' are expected
to become self-funding.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: Boeing looks for more lift from Chinese
orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING is trying to follow last week's Dollars 800m aircraft sale to China
with further orders of a similar size.
The Clinton administration is nearing a decision on its Most Favoured Nation
status trade policy towards China while the soaring US trade deficit with
China remains an intractable problem. For China to lose MFN status would
make imports more expensive, and China sees aircraft purchases as a way to
buy political goodwill.
Boeing, too, has a strategic need to sell to China. While loss-making
western airlines are cancelling orders, China has the world's
fastest-growing aviation market. Air travel rose last year by about 30 per
cent, and there has been a surge of smaller regional airlines. Over the next
decade, experts forecast China will need 50 aircraft a year to meet
passenger demand.
That demand has already led to a series of orders by Beijing for Boeings.
The Dollars 800m contract was for 20 737-300 aircraft and one 757-200.
Boeing is hoping Beijing will now buy wide-bodied 767 aircraft, which can
carry 260 passengers, as well as its yet-to-be launched, longer-range 777
aircraft, which seat 380 people. In principle, Air China of Beijing would
acquire the 777s and China Southwest would purchase the 767s.
Whether Beijing goes through with another bloc purchase of Boeings, however,
will depend on whether it believes such a step will reap it political
dividends. 'If they are not buying the goodwill they had hoped, they will go
to Airbus,' said one aviation analyst. Airbus - the European consortium of
French, German, British and Spanish companies - is number two in the world
market for commercial passenger aircraft.
The Chinese buying mission to the US, led by Gan Ziyu, vice-chairman of the
State Planning Commission, has become a yearly event, as Beijing seeks to
persuade the US to continue granting it MFN status, which allows Chinese
exports to qualify for the lowest US tariffs.
This is not the first time Beijing has sought to use aircraft buying as
political leverage. With its recent purchase of 12 Airbuses and options for
more through Germany, it showed it could by-pass France, the headquarters of
Airbus. China has tried to blacklist French makers over the sale of Mirage
jets to Taiwan last year.
Both Airbus and Boeing want Chinese sales to plug the gap in aircraft
deliveries over the next two to three years until profits at western
airlines recover. The stage is set for a tough battle,but the winner could
emerge through a political decision in Washington in June.

Finnair, the loss-making Finnish national airline, has taken a step towards
replacing its 44-strong fleet of McDonnell Douglas and Airbus aircraft with
Boeings by the end of the decade, Hugh Carnegy writes from Stockholm.
The airline, 70 per cent state-owned, said it had signed a letter of intent
with Boeing and International Lease Finance Corporation to restructure the
fleet based on the Boeing 767 long-haul and 737 short-haul families of
aircraft. Discussions would be completed within three months after which
Finnair would decide whether to proceed.
Mr Antti Potila, president of Finnair, said the agreement was preliminary
and non-binding and did not close the door to Airbus and McDonnell Douglas.

THE European Commission yesterday played down the significance of French
concern about the recent EC-Japan deal on exports of Japanese vehicles to
the Community during 1993.
Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, and Mr Alain Lamassoure,
minister for European affairs, have written to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC
industry commissioner, expressing worries about the deal, which should lead
to a 9.4 per cent drop in the number of Japanese cars and vans exported to
the EC this year.
The Commission has not yet received the letter, but officials said yesterday
they believed the concerns were mainly 'technical'.
France is one of five EC countries which have had to lift national quotas on
Japanese vehicles, as part of a 1991 agreement which should lead to a
completely open EC market by the end of the decade.
In spite of the overall drop in exports to the EC, Japanese exports to
France will actually increase this year from 69,016 to 77,300, as the
liberalisation of the French market begins to take effect.
The new French government wants to know how the EC estimated demand in the
Community for 1993.
Japanese and Community officials agreed earlier this month that European
demand would fall by 6.5 per cent against 1992, but the French industry
estimates that its national market could shrink by as much as 10 per cent.
French manufacturers are also concerned about the impact of imports of
Japanese cars made in other Community countries.
These so-called 'transplants' were taken into account by EC and Japanese
negotiators but not included in the agreed figures.

US, CANADIAN and Mexican officials have started a series of negotiations on
side agreements to complete the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the
same time, however, US legislators were raising doubts about the binational
dispute settlement mechanism already operating between the US and Canada.
The US National Pork Producers' Council warned that a decision against their
group by a binational appeals panel, the extraordinary challenge committee,
has 'cast a shadow over the entire binational panel process' set up under
the US-Canada free trade pact.
The three-member committee ruled that, while a lower binational panel, which
ruled against the US, 'may have erred' in its interpretation of a US
Commerce Department application of the countervailing duty law, 'on balance
the committee was not persuaded that the panel failed to apply the properly
articulated standard of review.'
'The committee itself said the panel may be wrong,' said Mr Karl Johnson,
president of the pork producers. 'Why have the extraordinary challenge
committee process at all if a binational panel's blatant flaws cannot be
overturned?'
One issue was a decision by the original binational panel to refuse
documents from the Commerce Department which were alleged to have shown how
Canadian subsidies support the pork industry there.
The committee said the refusal was 'somewhat surprising', in that a previous
panel had ruled against the US on the grounds that there was not substantial
evidence shown to support a Commerce decision.
US parties have not done well in the binational process, according to Ms
Joanna McIntosh, one of the attorneys for the pork council.
Of the 10 cases brought concerning US agency determinations, six have gone
against the US and three ended with no improvement - the US side has won
just once.
More than a third of the US Senate wrote to President Clinton in January,
warning that a negative decision in the pork case 'could have grave
implications for pending cases'.

FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: E Europe urged to renew ex-Soviet ties -
No firm dates offered for EC membership
</HEADLINE>

EC member states yesterday urged central and east European countries to
rebuild commercial ties with the former Soviet republics to strengthen trade
liberalisation in Europe.
The call came at the end of a two-day international conference in
Copenhagen, but several delegations cautioned that greater regional
co-operation in the east should not be a substitute for improved market
access to western Europe and eventual EC membership.
Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign affairs minister who emerged as the
champion of the former communist countries in eastern Europe, said: 'This is
not a bad idea. But it only makes sense if integration goes ahead with
western Europe.'
A free trade zone in east Europe would complement existing efforts to cut
barriers between Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary and Slovakia - the
so-called Visegrad Four. But it remains politically sensitive as east
European countries fear being pushed back towards markets in Russia and the
former Soviet Union.
The Copenhagen meeting was organised by the Danish government to discuss how
best to foster economic development and political stability in central and
eastern Europe. In addition to delegates from the 12 EC countries and the
Visegrad Four were members of the European Free Trade Area, the Baltic
states, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia. Russia was not represented.
The conference highlighted the contradiction between western European
countries' political desire to help the former communist countries and the
economic reality of recession, which has made them reluctant to offer
generous concessions on market access.
Despite misgivings among free trade-minded countries such as the UK,
Denmark, Switzerland and the Nordic states, the final communique avoided
concrete offers on market access. It noted only that the EC and Efta, among
others, had an important role in opening markets progressively 'on a
mutually advantageous basis'.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, suggested the conference
could increase political support for faster moves to open the EC's markets
to central and east European imports. The issue is to be considered at the
EC summit in June.
At present the EC has struck association agreements with six east European
countries, including the Visegrad Four, Romania and Bulgaria. These provide
for progressive dismantling of trade barriers, but contain restrictions on
sensitive items such as agriculture, textiles and steel - all of which
remain key export earners in eastern Europe.
The conference, which was non-binding, did not offer a firm date for EC
membership for Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Mr Niels
Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, spoke of a 'clear perspective' on
membership but added: 'It makes no sense to set a time. It can't be done. It
would not help.'

FT  15 APR 93 / World Trade News: Miyazawa confident of import rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, leaves Tokyo today for
Washington, confident that the Dollars 117bn domestic economic package
announced on Tuesday, and the benefits it will have in increasing domestic
demand for imports, is sufficient to soothe US concerns about its Dollars
46bn merchandise trade deficit with Japan.
But he will not, by all official accounts, be bringing a new trade
initiative to his first meeting with President Bill Clinton. The latter will
have to be satisfied, for the time being, with a stimulant package designed
to lift the Japanese economy out of its doldrums and thereby help boost
world growth, and with a Japanese willingness to lend an attentive ear to
any US ideas on how Japan might help reduce its massive trade surplus.
Mr Miyazawa will convey his belief to Mr Clinton that the package will put
the Japanese economy firmly on the road to recovery and that such
macro-economic measures are the proper way to address the nagging problem of
the two countries' trade imbalance. The lift that the new measures will give
to imports is estimated by Japan's ministry of international trade and
industry at more than Dollars 8bn.
Also, the package includes government procurement of many products in which
the US is competitive, such as medical equipment and computers.
Mr Miyazawa may find, however, that US enthusiasm for Japan's efforts is not
quite what he had expected. US government officials now in Tokyo, for the
meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers, have shown a measured response
to the economic package.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, while acknowledging Japan's recent
efforts to reduce the deficit, suggested that the US expects more. He
stressed the need for continued stimulation and increasing demand, calling
the economic package 'a step forward - but you need to look beyond the
headlines.'
Mr Clinton is unlikely to be pleasantly surprised by a Japanese proposal on
addressing sectoral issues. Japan has repeatedly stated that it will not
discuss quantitative market-opening targets, which are favoured by US
officials as a means to reduce the trade deficit with Japan.
However, leading trade officials in Tokyo indicate that, targets aside, they
are prepared to be flexible towards any proposals the US has on trade
issues, including the setting-up of a new forum for discussing bilateral
issues.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: In an effort to boost sales of US auto
parts in Japan, the US Commerce Department and Japan's Miti will sponsor a
two-day conference on June 2-3 at Dearborn, Michigan. The aim is to lift
sales to Dollars 19bn in 1994. In 1991, the US sold some Dollars 10.5bn of
auto parts to Japan.
US parts producers have complained that they are being discriminated against
by Japanese companies manufacturing in the US.
The conference will bring together senior Japanese auto executives and US
parts suppliers to discuss Japanese procurement practices and future
opportunities for the sale of US auto parts in Japan.

Korean shopkeepers were putting up razorwire in Los Angeles yesterday, as
the city waited for a verdict in the federal trial of four white policemen
accused of a 1991 beating of black motorist Rodney King. Hopes that a
decision had been reached were raised briefly when the judge recalled
lawyers to the court late yesterday. However, he announced that one of the
jurors had become ill and had asked to see a doctor. The jury was expected
to reassemble this morning for a sixth day of deliberations.

FT  15 APR 93 / VAT may finance US health plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VALUE added tax is back as an option for financing the Clinton
administration's healthcare reform plan, senior US officials said yesterday.
Ms Alice Rivlin, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget,
told a Washington conference that VAT or some other form of national sales
tax was 'clearly a possible candidate' for financing the overhaul of the
healthcare system.
'Certainly, we are looking at a VAT,' added Ms Donna Shalala, health and
human services secretary, interviewed by the newspaper USA Today.
VAT, common in most other developed countries, is backed by several US
senators and seen by others as inevitable in the long run. Most advocates,
however, have argued it should be introduced as part of a comprehensive
reform of the US tax system, in place of a considerable portion of the
revenue now raised from income taxes.
President Bill Clinton said two months ago that he did not want to
complicate his economic plan with such a radical change as the introduction
of VAT, ruling the idea out for at least the next four or five years.
White House officials have also said in recent weeks that VAT had been
explicitly ruled out as a way of financing the healthcare reform.
But Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House spokesman, confirmed yesterday
that the idea of VAT was again under consideration, although Mr Clinton had
made no decision.
White House officials say at least 20 different tax options are still on the
table for financing the healthcare reform, with 'sin taxes' on alcohol,
tobacco and guns especially favoured because they curb unhealthy habits that
burden the medical system.
Ms Rivlin said yesterday that a national VAT had 'a good deal to recommend
it' because of the US need to boost investment rather than consumption. On
the other hand, it would be regressive in its impact, and could also hurt
states' revenues from local sales taxes.
A White House task force is still at work on the administration's healthcare
reform plan, expected to be completed in mid-May.
The core goals of the reform plan are to ensure all US citizens have some
form of health coverage and a guarantee that this not be jeopardised if they
change jobs or become sick. All that is almost certain to cost the
government a great deal more than the current system, where most people have
health insurance provided by their employer.
At least in the short term it will prove expensive to extend coverage to the
estimated 37m people who have no employer-provided health insurance but do
not qualify for the government's Medicaid or Medicare schemes, which cover
the poor and the elderly.
Over the longer term the administration hopes that the reforms will pay for
themselves by bringing medical costs under control.
Administration officials say the outlines of their plan include a health
security card that would guarantee every citizen access to a standard
package of health benefits.

The TGWU said the two unions would consult about developing a co-ordinated
approach toward the United Parcel Service company.
The co-operation agreement would also cover an exchange of information and
educational facilities but concentrate on developing common interests in
global transport.
'As capital becomes more internationally mobile, so must organisations of
labour co-ordinate their work across national boundaries', said Mr Bill
Morris, TGWU general secretary.

HAITI'S military-backed prime minister has said he will resign to make way
for democracy, but has also laid out conditions that would further delay
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
Prime Minister Marc Bazin's statement came immediately after Mr Dante
Caputo, UN special envoy, put forward proposals to end the country's
18-month-old political crisis.
Mr Caputo suggested a blanket amnesty to the leaders of the September 1991
coup if they made way for an Aristide-approved government. The plan is
strongly supported by the Clinton administration.
Mr Bazin said he would resign as soon as Mr Aristide had designated a new
cabinet leader, but the new prime minister should be subject to approval by
the army, the two main parliamentary groups, and business, community and
church leaders.

FT  15 APR 93 / Caribbean goes shopping for citizens: Canute James sights
Far Eastern businessmen looking for a haven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISTANT ramification of the diplomatic skirmish between Britain and China
over the future of Hong Kong is being felt on the eastern Caribbean island
of Dominica, where citizenship is 'for sale'.
Dominica has been casting its net throughout south-east Asia for the past
year, in an effort to entice, with the offer of passports, new 'economic
citizens' in exchange for investments. Businessmen from the Far Eastern
British colony have been visiting.
The prospective citizen pays the government USDollars 25,000, which goes
into a trust fund, and makes an initial business investment of not less than
Dollars 35,000 in a venture producing for export and employing Dominicans.
The country is not alone in making an eastern Caribbean pitch for wealthy
citizens. The government of St Kitts-Nevis plans to sell several hundred
passports to residents of Hong Kong, who appear concerned about the future
of the colony when it comes under Chinese control in 1997.
St Kitts-Nevis officials say they will not grant more than 3,000 'economic
citizenships' and that many of those who qualify would not live in the
twin-island country, which has a population of 50,000 people. However, the
phantom immigrants would have a haven in case of need.
In the same region, the government of Antigua is studying a similar
programme to attract investors from the Far East. An official said the
administration favours issuing economic visas, as in Canada.
To the west across the Caribbean, Jamaica has launched a programme to
attract 'business migrants', to draw both their professional skills and
their money. The programme was launched in Hong Kong but the Jamaican
government says it is willing to consider applicants from any country.
Jamaica has stipulated no minimum investment, but preference will be given
to prospective migrants willing to commit no less than Dollars 100,000 in
ventures creating local jobs. Indirect investors will also be favoured, if
able to put Dollars 100,000 in a venture capital fund, in non-transferable
government bonds for at least 10 years, or in approved private joint
ventures. A successful applicant will receive resident status and a
passport, and will be able to apply for Jamaican citizenship.
There is, however, concern over the consequences of some of these programmes
in the Caribbean's labour-surplus economies. There is little to prevent an
investor shutting up shop on one island when his tax holiday - one of the
many incentives - has expired and starting anew in a neighbouring country.
Government spokesmen in Grenada say they have turned down requests for
special citizenship for Hong Kong residents.
Besides the extra strain of an influx of new citizens on a social and
physical infrastructure already overstretched, their presence could affect
external financing of island economies.
Many eastern Caribbean governments have complained repeatedly and bitterly
about the tendency of international financial institutions and aid agencies,
applying per capita income criteria, to place their countries outside the
category of those entitled to cheap loans. The presence of a few well-heeled
economic citizens could push the island economies even further away from
soft-money windows.

FT  15 APR 93 / Unpopular governor asks for more time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Jim Florio of New Jersey has given encouragement this week to all
incumbent politicians who have plumbed the depths of unpopularity while in
office. He announced that he will seek re-election in November to a second
term.
The east coast Democrat is by no means sure of success. Most state polls
show him behind, or level with, two prominent Republicans, Mrs Christine
Todd Whitman and Mr Carey Edwards. Both have recently been saddled with
another contemporary US problem, failure to pay taxes on their domestic
staff.
But the fact that the governor is now given a fighting chance has made him
very much the Easter week candidate, for few politicians have ever been
declared so politically dead, so often, as has the 55-year-old Mr Florio.
If he recovers and wins in the autumn, then many others who had fallen on
hard times through their attempts to impose fiscal disciplines on their
states may take heart. Among them are Mr Pete Wilson, Republican governor of
California, and even Mr Mario Cuomo, Democratic governor of New York and no
longer a candidate for the next vacancy on the US Supreme Court.
Mr Florio, elected in 1989 by a landslide, had seemed the quintessential
victim of the Republican era of revulsion to higher taxes. He immediately
pushed through the state legislature, then in Democratic hands, a Dollars
2.8bn tax increase, plus other controversial measures covering education,
insurance and gun control.
Political retribution was immediate. Within two years the legislature was in
Republican hands and the state's most popular politician, Democratic Senator
Bill Bradley, nearly lost his re-election bid to Mrs Whitman because of his
association with Mr Florio.
However, in recent months a recovery seems to have been under way in the
state economy and in the governor's fortunes. A victory was recorded this
year when the legislature withstood great pressure from the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and refused to override his veto of attempts to eviscerate
his tough gun control law.
The fact that Mr Florio has recruited Mr James Carville, President Bill
Clinton's strategic mastermind last year, to direct his re-election effort
is considered important. The 'ragin' Cajun', who also engineered the
stunning Pennsylvania Senate by-election victory in 1991 by Mr Harris
Wofford, the Democratic longshot, is the hottest political adviser in the US
at present.
In declaring his candidacy this week, Mr Florio sought to cast himself, not
unlike Mr Clinton, as a man unafraid to take tough decisions in difficult
times. Also borrowing from earlier in the president's political career, he
said he had learned in his first term 'to talk less and listen more'. Mr
Clinton lost his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas largely
because he had tried to push through a series of measures considered too
radical by his state.

RIOTS swept South Africa yesterday and at least six people were shot dead
after one of the largest political protests in the country's history, called
to mourn slain activist Chris Hani.
President F W de Klerk announced further security measures in advance of
Monday's funeral of the murdered Communist party leader.
But political leaders, including officials of the African National Congress,
made clear that the death toll yesterday was lower than might have been
expected, given that hundreds of thousands of people attended rallies and
protest gatherings and millions stayed away from work. Employer
organisations said 80-90 per cent of workers remained at home.
On national television, Mr De Klerk said that yesterday had been 'a dark day
for South Africa,' adding 'what happened. . . cannot be tolerated in any
civilised country.' He said 3,000 extra police would be added to anti-riot
units in the wake of the violence, more unrest areas could be declared, and
that authorities might clamp down on types of protest allowed.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, took a less gloomy view of the
day's events, saying the countrywide mourning had gone off 'relatively
peacefully.' He believed the pace of constitutional negotiations would pick
up, and that there would be joint black-white control of the security
services within two months.
Mr Ramaphosa criticised what he said was an unprovoked attack by police on
demonstrators in Soweto, where marshals struggled, but succeeded, in
controlling a crowd tens of thousands strong. At least four people were
killed and some 250 injured, five of them critically.
But in Cape Town, Durban, Pietermaritzburg and Port Elizabeth ANC officials
appeared to lose control of the large crowds, which attacked police, smashed
windows and looted shops after breaking away from rallies addressed by ANC
leaders.
Police appeared to act with restraint in the areas, although there were
unconfirmed reports that at least two people had been killed in Cape Town.
The Soweto shooting broke out when an angry crowd marched on a police
station after attending a rally addressed by Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader.
Mr Mandela implored a packed stadium to act peacefully.
He praised the white Afrikaner woman whose eyewitness evidence had led to
the apprehension of Mr Hani's alleged murderer and said to South Africa's
youth: 'Your duty is to take such examples and use them to build a new
non-racial nation.'
Violence erupting erupted only after he had departed to address a rally in a
nearby town.
However, Mr Carl Niehaus, an ANC spokesman, warned after the Soweto
shooting: 'This kind of action by police is exactly what will lead this
country to bloodshed and. . . the consequences in days to come must be laid
squarely at the door of the police force.'
Financial markets reacted nervously to events. The financial rand - a
barometer of foreign investor confidence - closed at R4.82 against the
dollar, compared with R4.56 before Mr Hani's death. The stock market index
fell by 31 points to 3,498, having shed 51 points on Tuesday.
Although yesterday's unrest will have depressed businessmen, few would have
been surprised.
Mr Jeff Liebesman, chairman of the W&amp;A group, an industrial conglomerate,
said he was 'disappointed and upset' at yesterday's events, but not shocked.
'We were braced for it as a group.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG yesterday celebrated the end of the Sino-British political
deadlock in traditional fashion, with the Hang Seng Index surging 371.53
points to a record high of 6,789.74.
Local politicians displayed rather less optimism, however, that the four-day
talks to be held by Britain and China would resolve the dispute over Hong
Kong's political development, and Beijing issued further warnings indicating
that the stock market reaction could be premature.
A UK foreign office spokesman said Hong Kong's three representatives would
join the negotiations with China on April 22 as equal members of the team,
implying that Britain had won a diplomatic concession from the Chinese.
However, Mr Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of
Xinhua News Agency - the official mouthpiece for China - yesterday declared
that the Hong Kong representatives would merely adopt the role of advisers
or experts, in accordance with China's initial demands.
Regardless of the semantics, a stumbling block has clearly been overcome in
allowing talks to be resumed. But as one Legislative Councillor said
yesterday: 'It is possible that the gap between the two sides is still
large. China wants the freedom to appoint its own lackeys, while the British
want an honourable retreat.'
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said he was not optimistic
about a resolution. But he argued that Mr Patten, the Hong Kong governor,
appeared to have won an important procedural point, and had proven that
Britain could successfully stand up to China.
He said: 'Let us hope this is a sobering reminder to the China clique
(so-called Foreign Office Sinophiles such as former Beijing Ambassador Sir
Percy Craddock) that theirs is not the right way.'
Foreign investors took more encouragement from the diplomatic breakthrough.
Stock market turnover hit an all-time high of HKDollars 7.7bn (Pounds 652m)
compared with the previous record of HKDollars 6.3bn set in May 1992.
Brokers expected follow-through buying from London and New York to push the
index further today.
A resolution to the dispute would stimulate corporate earnings. It would
spark an increase in property prices and provide the economic benefits of a
go-ahead for several big infrastructure projects, which have become pawns in
the political conflict.
The most politically marked company in the stock market, Jardine Matheson -
which in December was singled out by China as a 'bad element in Hong Kong's
business community' - was the best performing blue chip stock of the day,
climbing HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 55.
Mr William Overholt, managing director of Bankers Trust (Hong Kong) said: 'I
don't think that there is a view that things will go smoothly. But the Hong
Kong community has now come to the conclusion that China will do nothing to
harm Hong Kong. The basic fear of 1997 has evaporated.'

FT  15 APR 93 / Rabin and Mubarak meet in bid to put peace talks on schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB delegations to the Middle East peace talks will wait until Saturday
before deciding whether to attend the next round of negotiations scheduled
for Washington on Tuesday.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the last effort at conciliation
yesterday when he met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, in Ismaliya
on the Suez Canal. The talks were the final stage of a series of contacts
involving the US, Israel, Egypt, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon.
Senior representatives from the four Arab delegations will meet in Damascus
tomorrow and Saturday to make their decision.
Mr Mubarak said there were 'very great hopes' that peace negotiations would
resume on schedule but neither he nor Mr Rabin offered any details on the
substance of their talks.
While Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to proceed
with negotiations, the Palestinians have demanded that Israel should pledge
not to repeat the December deportation of more than 400 men from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza.
Israel has indicated that it may be prepared to take back some Palestinians
who had been deported over the past several years and also allow
Palestinians from east Jerusalem to become members of its negotiating team.
Mr Rabin confirmed yesterday that Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who comes from east
Jerusalem and is the leading Palestinian in the West Bank, could in future
head the Palestinian delegation. It might indicate some easing of Israel's
previous insistence that it would not discuss the status of east Jerusalem,
which it annexed after the 1967 war.
At a news conference later the Israeli leader reassured Palestinians that
their two peoples would ultimately settle their conflict based on a swap of
land for peace.

gushing 81st birthday tribute to 'Great Leader' Kim Il-sung, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
In a keynote speech to a 'national celebration' in the capital, Mr Kang
hailed Mr Kim's birth on April 15, 1913, as 'a big stroke of luck which
heralded the dawn of national liberation and rebirth on the dark land of the
country ..'
Pyongyang's defiance of demands by the UN atomic watchdog agency for access
to suspected nuclear weapons sites has prompted the UN Security Council to
consider punitive sanctions.

More than 70,000 people came out in a scorching summer sun yesterday to call
for an end to the politics of religion which has led to widespread
Hindu-Moslem riots in India, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The rally to
affirm India's secular constitution was called by 13 left and left-of-centre
political parties near the historic Red Fort in the old city of Delhi.
Speakers at the rally charged the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), which spearheaded the movement for building a temple on
the site of the mosque, for injecting religion into politics.
The Indian government has removed cars and white goods, such as
refrigerators and washing machines, from the list of industries requiring
licences, the Press Trust of India said, Reuter adds from New Delhi.
It quoted an official spokesman as saying that, since the government has
introduced full convertibility of the rupee, investments should be
determined by the availability of foreign exchange, making licensing in
these sectors unnecessary.

IRAN'S central bank devalued the rial 6.7 per cent against the dollar
yesterday, and stepped up the sale of foreign exchange in a bid to take
control of a volatile currency market, Reuter reports from Tehran.
In its second devaluation in three weeks, the bank set the rial at 1,648/50
to the dollar against Tuesday's 1,538/41.
Several dozen state bank branches in Tehran began selling up to Dollars
5,000 (Pounds 3,300) to any buyers after Tuesday's announcement that the
rial would be fully convertible.
The central bank acted after the rial sank to a new low of 1,830 to the
dollar on Sunday, raising fears of a free-fall after an official devaluation
of up to 95.6 per cent on March 27.
The first devaluation jolted prices. Newspapers report a 30 per cent jump in
prices of household goods since early March - about equal to the rise in
wholesale prices in the 11 months to February 19 over the same period a year
ago.
Meanwhile, Irna, the official news agency said a British trade mission to
Tehran planned for next month was likely to be postponed because of London's
public support for novelist Salman Rushdie, ordered killed by Iran for
alleged blasphemy.

</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WITHDRAWAL of Khmer Rouge officials from the Cambodian capital on
Tuesday night has raised fears that the guerrilla group will step up attacks
across Cambodia ahead of next month's UN-sponsored elections.
Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, said in a letter yesterday
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who chairs Cambodia's interim Supreme National
Council (SNC), that Khmer Rouge officials no longer felt secure in Phnom
Penh, although the UN has blamed most of the recent violence in the country
on Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
The withdrawal will make it difficult for the 22,000-strong UN Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (Untac) to communicate with the Khmer Rouge
leadership, except via Thailand. It was not immediately clear if Mr Khieu
Samphan would be prepared to visit Phnom Penh to attend future meetings of
the SNC, which brings together the four main factions and the UN.
The attitude of the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of 1m
Cambodians when it ran the country between 1975 and 1978, is regarded as
crucial for the peace process because its guerrillas and the rival army of
the Phnom Penh administration are the only substantial Cambodian military
forces.
The group has effectively pulled out of the peace process already, by
seeking to disrupt the elections, refusing to disarm its fighters and
rejecting UN attempts to gain access to Khmer Rouge territory.
Seven UN peacekeepers have been killed in the past three weeks, and the UN
blames the Khmer Rouge for most of the deaths.
Yesterday Untac attempted to lure the Khmer Rouge back to its compound
behind the royal palace in Phnom Penh by saying that UN forces could provide
extra security for Mr Khieu Samphan and his followers.
In Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries
said the elections should go ahead. Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign
minister, urged Untac to persevere because the alternative would be
'uncontrolled fighting again in Cambodia'.

FT  15 APR 93 / US isolation grows over Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'road map' set out by former President George Bush for normalising
relations between Vietnam and the US has already led the two countries into
a few dead ends and several potholes.
The discovery in Moscow of a document apparently showing that Vietnam may
have held twice as many US prisoners of war as it ever admitted seems sure
to throw another obstacle in the way of their awkward march towards full
links.
While US policy towards Vietnam is officially under review, it has been
widely assumed in Washington - although without any explicit statement from
President Bill Clinton himself - that the new administration would not
depart dramatically from the Bush road map.
This set out a phased progression to lifting the US trade embargo and
establishing full dramatic relations in exchange for Vietnam's co-operation
on accounting for US servicemen listed as missing in action during the
Vietnam war and on the UN sponsored peace process in neighbouring Cambodia.
The next phase foreseen in the road map would involve the US lifting its
trade embargo against Vietnam, ending its opposition to reinstating the
country in the International Monetary Fund and supporting loans by the IMF
and the World Bank for basic human needs.
The US is growing more and more isolated in its insistence on maintaining an
embargo against Vietnam.
Other western nations, which have until now held back out of deference to
the US from helping Vietnam back into the IMF, now seem increasingly
inclined to press ahead willy nilly.
A support group led by France stands ready to provide a bridging loan to pay
off Vietnam's arrears to the IMF of around Dollars 140m (Pounds 92m). Mr
Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, has made it clear he feels
Hanoi's economic policies would already qualify it for normal IMF financing,
allowing it to repay this bridging loan.
This, in turn, would pave the way for World Bank infrastructure lending
which Vietnam sorely needs.
The support group had been expected to meet during the IMF's spring meetings
later this month. Until the prisoners of war document surfaced in Moscow
this week, Fund officials had expected the Clinton administration to signal
its acceptance of Vietnam's reinstatement by lifting the embargo.
Such a move now appears, in the short term at least, to be politically
impossible for Mr Clinton: whether or not the Moscow document is authentic -
and the Vietnamese are not alone in crying 'forgery' - it has the ring of
truth to a substantial body of US opinion, which is unlikely ever to be
reconciled to the probability that no MIAs are still held in Vietnam.
Opinion in the Senate, however, is increasingly shifting towards the view
that the best way of ensuring progress on MIA issues, as well as on other US
concerns such as human rights violations in Vietnam, is to establish closer
relations.
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations committee, and Senator Richard Lugar, his Republican opposite
number, wrote together last month to urge Mr Clinton to lift the embargo.
'We believe that an aggressive and enlightened bilateral and multilateral
dialogue with Vietnam will eventually result in democratic change in Vietnam
and achieve a more complete resolution of the POW/MIA issue,' they wrote.

<TEXT>
PAKISTANI President Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued a stern warning to Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif yesterday to resolve what he called grave problems and
to end a crisis that threatens his government, Reuter reports from
Islamabad.
Mr Sharif met the president for the third time in 10 days to try to end a
bitter feud that many ministers have said could prompt Mr Ishaq Khan to use
his powers to dissolve the National Assembly (lower house).
Mr Sharif enraged the president in February when he set up a committee to
modify the Eighth Amendment, martial law-era legislation that empowers the
president to dissolve parliament and appoint the armed forces chiefs of
staff.
Six cabinet ministers and two advisers have resigned in an apparent show of
support for the president in the present tussle.
Mr Sharif undertook to act on 'an urgent basis' and to report to the
president with precise measures, the statement said.
Fears that Mr Sharif's 2 1/2 -year coalition government, weakened by several
desertions in the past year, could fall sent the stock exchange into a
tailspin.
'The stock market has nose-dived and business activity is suffering because
of the political instability,' Mr Sharif told reporters earlier in the day.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index has plunged 25 points since Sunday.
'The uncertain political situation will affect the economy, which in turn
will bring unemployment,' he said. 'Unemployment breeds anarchy.'
Mr Sharif said political instability could reverse Pakistan's ambitious
reform programme to deregulate the economy.
Last week the prime minister nominated Mr Ishaq Khan for a second term to
try to end the hardening antagonism.
Mr Ishaq Khan, whose five-year term expires late this year, used the Eighth
Amendment to dismiss former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on charges of
corruption and misrule in 1990 and feels betrayed by her successor's bid to
curb his authority.
General Abdul Waheed, chief of army staff, postponed a visit to France due
to begin today. His visit to the US from April 20 will go ahead.
Diplomats said Gen Waheed may have postponed his departure because of the
mounting domestic political crisis.
Should the president decide to dissolve parliament, they said, he would be
unlikely to act without consulting the chief of army staff - the most
powerful pillar in the ruling troika with the president and prime minister.
The army has governed Pakistan for most of its 45 years since independence
from Britain and partition in 1947.

NEW ZEALAND consumer prices in the year to March 31 rose by 1 per cent, a
result only bettered by Australia in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the government statistician said yesterday.
Australia's inflation rate was 0.3 per cent. The low New Zealand annual rate
continues a trend, with the CPI registering 1.3 per cent in the year to
December and 1 per cent in the 12 months to September.
In the three months to March the CPI was 0.1 per cent, a figure that
surprised economists who had been predicting a rise because of an increase
in home mortgage rates in January.
This followed the Reserve Bank's decision to intervene to support the New
Zealand dollar in pursuit of its low inflation target when it appeared
likely the currency would fall below its target of 52 on the index which
measures the value of the dollar on a trade weighted basis with the
country's main trading partners.
The statistics department also reported yesterday that food prices had
fallen 1.3 per cent in March.
This followed increases of 1.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent in February and
January, which were due to poor weather affecting the price of fruit,
vegetables and meat.

<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy will start to recover only gradually towards the end of
the year, in spite of the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) emergency spending
programme announced by the government on Tuesday, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank
of Japan's governor, warned yesterday.
His remarks came as retailers confirmed the depth of the slump in consumer
spending, with an 11.4 per cent fall in sales at Tokyo's 27 main department
stores last month.
Mr Mieno's cautious assessment of the special package's impact on the
economy, which is mired in the worst downturn for two decades, sharply
contrasts with the government's view that it will pave the way for a
sustained recovery.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, in a speech to executives from
trust banks said the Y13,200bn package, mainly made up of public works
spending, would promote sustained recovery in the second half of the 1993
financial year.
Mr Mieno said that recent increases in car sales, industrial shipments and
the surge in the Tokyo stock marketmight indicate that the decline in
business confidence was coming to a halt.
However, he cautioned that it was too early to say the economy was ready to
recover given the depth of the slump in consumer spending and corporate
investment.
The March fall in Tokyo department store sales was the sharpest monthly drop
recorded since the Japan Department Stores Association started collecting
statistics in 1965.
Sales of clothes, furniture and household appliances were particularly hard
hit.

FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Coup defendants protest at trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trial of 12 former Soviet and Communist party leaders charged with high
treason for organising the unsuccessful coup in August 1991 began yesterday.
It opened with a flurry of claims by the defendants that they were being
tried in a non-existent country by the wrong people on a punishing schedule.
One of the defendants, Mr Alexander Tizyakov, 67, was taken ill half an hour
before the end of the afternoon session. Mr Tizyakov, a less prominent
member of the 'State Committee for the Extraordinary Situation', as the
plotters called themselves, was head of the state industrialists'
association.
Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, former speaker of the Soviet parliament and an intimate
of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, argued that the prosecutors,
drawn from the military department of the Russian Supreme Court, were
biased. He noted that they would be under the command of General Pavel
Grachev, the defence minister, who will be one of the witnesses.
Gen Grachev came out against the plotters during the coup.
Major General Anatoly Ukolov, the presiding judge, dismissed the claim, as
he did an earlier plea that the case be dismissed as the court had no
jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the Soviet Union. The
defendants also argued unsuccessfully that the court's schedule be relaxed
to reflect the age of the defendants - many in their sixties - and the fact
that they had spent a year in prison.
The trial of the plotters promises to be long and at times rivetting - as
several of them, including Mr Lukyanov and Mr Valentin Pavlov, the former
Soviet prime minister, have made clear that they will point the finger at Mr
Gorbachev as having been at least a passive accomplice in developing the
coup. Mr Pavlov said in a recent interview that the former Soviet president
had indicated that he would return from his vacation villa - where he was
under house arrest - to lead the country if the plot succeeded.

A RUSSIAN company's attempt to ship a banned chemical to Libya was blocked
by Ukrainian customs officers at the southern port of Illichevsk last week,
writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
The seizure comes amid growing western concern that Russian defence
officials are seeking to profit from their nation's economic chaos by
selling dangerous substances to countries subjected to international
embargoes.
The action also suggests Ukraine is trying to tighten export controls in
response to western allegations that it was breaching sanctions against
Serbia by allowing oil to be shipped up the Danube from Ukrainian ports.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said 80 tonnes of ammonium perchlorate, being
shipped to Libya by the Moscow firm 'Pavoks', was seized by customs
officials. This can be used as a rocket fuel, although it also has medical
and farm applications.

FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Lamont sets a 10-year target for free
trade

THE G7 countries should commit themselves to establishing completely free
trade with Russia within 10 years to hasten Russian integration into the
world economy, Mr Norman Lamont, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, told
the Group of Seven's finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo.
He said such a timetable would be a symbol of economic partnership, rather
than merely aid.
Mr Lamont also announced a Pounds 380m addition to the UK's bilateral aid
programme to promote economic reform in Russia and other countries of the
former Soviet Union.
The additional assistance would bring British aid to the former Soviet Union
to Pounds 1.1bn, including the UK's commitment to the EC's aid programme.
It is mainly in the form of Pounds 320m in export credits and insurance for
British companies investing in Russia.
Technical assistance to Russia will be doubled to Pounds 120m. Most of this
will go into an international fund to support the development of small and
medium-sized enterprises, with the rest to expand the recently launched
scheme to second Russian managers to British businesses to give them
experience of working in a market economy.
Mr Lamont said: 'Russia could be one of the biggest export markets for
British firms in the next decade. We want to help and encourage them to get
in on the ground floor and to establish links with Russia at an early
stage.'
However, the British proposal for a free trade agreement appeared to win
little immediate backing, apart from support from Japan.
Before yesterday's announcement Britain had pledged about Pounds 130m in
bilateral aid, including Pounds 38m for military safety and Pounds 60m to
the Know-how fund for business development. It had also provided Pounds 323m
in export credits and Pounds 321m for the EC aid programme.

FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Nations rival each other in Moscow aid

BEFORE Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, began negotiating with his
Group of Seven partners in Tokyo yesterday on the future of Russia, he noted
that nowadays the group is not as concerned with 'the balance of power as
with the balance sheet'.
Apart from agreement that, by international accounting standards, the
Russian balance sheet is definitely in poor shape, several of the G7 members
were ready to find fault with each other's reckoning of bilateral
contributions to the Russian cause.
'It has become a numbers game,' a Canadian official lamented. Mr Bentsen
himself observed that a Dollars 1.82bn (Pounds 1.2bn) Japanese package for
Russia announced yesterday was heavy on trade insurance, while Japanese
officials insisted the weighting of the aid stood comparison with that of
fellow members.
'Some commitments (by G7 members) are new and some commitments are not. When
you compare the Japanese commitment it is not as miserable as you might
think,' one said. Out of the Dollars 1.82bn, Japan is providing direct
grants of Dollars 320m for food, medical equipment and technical help and
Dollars 1.1bn in trade insurance and a Dollars 400m loan facility.
The US is also expected to announce a package of around Dollars 1.8bn at the
meeting, which ends tomorrow. This will include Dollars 500m towards a
Dollars 4bn privatisation fund for Russian industry. US officials proposed
the fund yesterday, but they are dependent on other G7 members mustering
another Dollars 1.5bn and international agencies, in particular the World
Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, supplying
about Dollars 2bn.
Japan had planned to announce only Dollars 1.2bn in assistance this week,
but apparently increased the figure to ensure favourable comparison with the
US.
German officials said they felt under no obligation to announce another
headline-grabbing figure, as the country's contributions account for an
estimated 67 per cent of the bilateral aid promised by G7 members over the
past two years and about 75 per cent of that already disbursed.
Italian representatives explained that the country is prepared to consider
future assistance, but would like Russia to remember that it has yet to
repay two outstanding commercial bank loans. French officials said the focus
should be on multilateral assistance, rather than bilateral figures.
The UK was generous in applauding the Japanese package as 'welcome,
excellent and a major contribution', though, as Mr Bentsen would say,
Britain's extra Dollars 600m package announced yesterday was also heavy on
export credits, which account for Dollars 500m.
The European Commission wanted to emphasise that its Dollars 3bn in already
announced assistance has been listed in its budget. A spokesperson said the
Commission put the stress on strategic technical assistance. 'We notice that
the Japanese package does contain technical assistance,' the EC said.
However, another US official said that comparing the respective packages of
the members was as difficult as 'comparing apples to oranges'.

FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Yeltsin seeks backing for attack on his
foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday promised 'more decisive action'
against the 'negative activities' of the Russian parliament if he wins the
support of the people in this month's referendum. He said he would resign
immediately if he were not supported.
The president said he had prepared a 'range of urgent measures' to present
to the country on April 26, the day after the referendum. Though he did not
specify in his meeting with the press what these would be, it was clear from
other remarks that ensuring a legal base for individuals to hold private
property would be foremost among them.
Mr Yeltsin has called for a Yes vote on all four questions in the
referendum.
These, decided by the Congress of People's Deputies during a bitterly fought
session, are on trust in the president; approval of the economic reform;
early elections for the presidency and for a new, one-chamber parliament. He
said he would define 'losing' as receiving a No vote on trust in himself and
on early parliamentary elections through which the Supreme Soviet and
Congress - a hangover from Soviet days - would be transformed to a bicameral
parliament on the democratic model.
Mr Yeltsin has done little campaigning and much of that has been lacklustre.
He has no single opponent - but Vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, have propelled ever-harsher
criticism of him and his government.
Asked if he sought the resignation of General Rutskoi - considered a
possible presidential contender - Mr Yeltsin said Gen Rutskoi was
'completely opposed to the reforms being introduced by the president'. He
asked: 'How can he work in such a situation?'.
Mr Yeltsin said he would define early elections as taking place in autumn
this year rather than, as had been mooted, in spring 1994. He said a new
constitution, guaranteeing all civil rights 'to world standards', was
already prepared and would now be sent for discussion to the republics and
regions of Russia.
The constitution, he said, could then be adopted either by a referendum or a
constituent assembly, or by the Council of the Federation itself. Mr
Yeltsin, who has increasingly used regional and republican leaders as allies
in his struggle with parliament, suggested that the last of these might be
the better way and said that the new constitution put the upper house of the
two-chamber parliament, the Chamber of the Federation, as the highest
legislative body.
Later, in talks with leaders of the Russian republics in Moscow, Mr Yeltsin
said a new constitution would create a presidential republic and a
'full-blooded federation'. He told the republican heads that the present
constitution, a patched version of the old Soviet era document, was an
'explosive mixture'.
Mr Yeltsin also said that he would meet other heads of the Commonwealth of
Independent States in Minsk tomorrow 'to discuss only one question - the
future of the CIS, when integration would begin and which (of the states)
would continue in an integrated community'.
However, he said Russia would cease to sell energy to former Soviet
republics at subsidised prices.

FT  15 APR 93 / Bosnia to reject peace plan if Srebrenica falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday warned it would withdraw support
for the international peace plan if Srebrenica, the besieged town near the
Serbian border, were captured by Bosnian Serb forces.
As reports came in that another eight people had been killed and 21 wounded
in the latest Serb artillery attack on the town on Tuesday night, the
Bosnian foreign ministry said: 'The fall of Srebrenica will signal the final
demise of the Vance-Owen (peace) plan.'
Under the plan - already signed by Bosnian Croats and Moslems, but rejected
by Serbs - the country would be divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
Srebrenica, surrounded by Serb militia, is in a region allocated to the
Moslems but which Bosnian Serbs want to absorb into their territory because
it is in a region adjoining the Serbian border.
The renewed attack on Srebrenica, after a fierce Serb bombardment of the
centre of the city last Monday during which at least 56 people were killed,
coincided with a fresh diplomatic offensive by the US and Russia in support
of the Vance-Owen plan.
Both the US and Russian special envoys to the Bosnian peace talks, Mr
Reginald Bartholomew and Mr Vitaly Churkin, had talks in Belgrade yesterday
with Serb and Yugoslav leaders, including President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia.
Mr Bartholomew emphasised time was running out for Bosnia's Serbs to sign
the plan.
He warned that, while the US was pursuing 'the diplomatic track' for the
moment, it was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the
peace plan. If it failed to do so, Washington would press its allies very
soon to help Bosnian Moslems arm themselves by a partial lifting of the UN
arms embargo.
'The military action must stop, the atrocities in places like Srebrenica
must stop,' Mr Bartholomew said, warning that otherwise Serbia would be
subject to the stiffest sanctions ever imposed. Yugoslav officials said Mr
Bartholomew, who also saw Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs,
wanted Serbs to come up with proposals on what modifications they wanted in
order to agree to the peace plan.
Mr Karadzic said he was not ready to sign the plan but that peace was still
possible. 'We are working hard on possible corrections that have been
announced (by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state) and we do hope
that we will make some progress.'
However, he made clear he would never concede control of the corridor across
northern Bosnia which links Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia with
Serbia.

FT  15 APR 93 / Sharp fall in Euro car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 9.4 per cent last month as demand
dropped steeply for the third month in succession.
In the first quarter, new car sales declined by 17.3 per cent to around
3.06m.
Sales in March declined to 1.18m from 1.3m in the equivalent month a year
earlier, according to industry estimates. Demand in March was lower than a
year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with higher sales
registered only in the UK and Greece.
The rate of decline moderated in March, following steep falls of 23 and 17
per cent in January and February, but leading carmakers are being forced to
lower further their already pessimistic sales forecasts for the full year.
General Motors, the US maker, said yesterday it now expected new car sales
in west Europe to fall by 11 per cent to only 11.95m this year from 13.45m
in 1992 compared with a 1993 forecast of 12.3m.
In Germany, the single biggest market in west Europe, sales fell by 14.9 per
cent in March to an estimated 363,000. Sales plunged by 21.7 per cent in the
first quarter.
Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement short-time
work and are cutting workforces in the face of shrinking profits or mounting
losses.
The rate of decline has accelerated in Italy, where new car registrations
fell by 20.8 per cent in March to 190,000.
New car sales in France in March were 9 per cent lower than a year ago,
while demand in Spain dropped steeply by 22.7 per cent.
The only significant relief is being shown in the UK, where sales in March
were 12.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in the first quarter rose
by 11.6 per cent. After plunging by a third during more than three years of
recession, sales in the UK have been higher than a year ago in each of the
last six months.

WEST Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5 per cent in 1993 because of the
continuing international recession, a relatively strong D-Mark and
persistent high domestic costs, the Cologne-based Institute for German
Economy (IW) said yesterday.
The report said the recession could only be overcome if prospects for
investment and profits improved and the Bundesbank obtained more room for
lower interest rates. But it warned unless domestic costs and price pressure
are dampened, economic recovery would not begin in 1993.
The report came out as figures released by the federal statistics office
showed West Germany's wholesale prices in March increasing by 0.2 per cent
against the previous month. This followed a similar rise in February and a
0.7 per cent increase in January.
In mid-March, West Germany's consumer prices were 0.3 per cent higher thanin
mid-February, bringingthe inflation rate to 4.2 per cent.
In east Germany, consumer prices increased in mid-March by 0.2 per cent to
8.8 per cent.
In its yearly spring report, the IW said investment in machinery and
equipment will fall by 9 per cent in 1993. Only the constructionsector shows
an upward trend,increasing by another 1 per cent this year.
The gloomy forecast was partially offset by brighter prospects in the east.
Real GDP in eastern Germany can be expected to rise by 6.5 per cent in 1993.

FT  15 APR 93 / French grain supplier applies for protection

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERAGRA, the French farming products business which was one of the most
prominent western suppliers of grain and food to eastern Europe during the
cold war, yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection.
The company, founded in 1955 by the late Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, known as le
milliardaire rouge, the red billionaire, has applied to the Paris commercial
court for protection. The court will announce its judgment on Tuesday.
In its heyday Interagra made annual sales of up to FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) by
selling the European Community's 'food mountain' - surplus supplies of
subsidised grain, meat, dairy products and powdered milk - to communist
countries.
Mr Doumeng built up the business by exploiting connections with eastern bloc
leaders but Interagra has floundered since his death in 1987.
The final blows were the collapse of the Soviet Union and the United Nations
embargo on trading with Iraq during the Gulf war. Annual sales have fallen
to just FFr5bn a year and its debts have risen rapidly to FFr500m.
France's commercial banks yesterday responded to the recent fall in money
market rates and to Tuesday's reduction in the Bank of France's repurchase
rate by cutting base rates from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent.
The reduction was triggered on Tuesday night by Credit du Nord. French base
rates had been held at 10 per cent since December as the French authorities
battled to defend the franc from speculative attack in the run-up to last
month's parliamentary elections.

FT  15 APR 93 / Andreotti inquiry told of link with Mafia killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, yesterday began
what could be the toughest battle of his long political career as hearings
began into lifting his parliamentary immunity.
The Senate hearings opened amid explosive new allegations of collusion by Mr
Andreotti, now a Christian Democrat life senator, with the Mafia. Implicit
in the allegations is that he was involved in two political assassinations.
New testimony from Mafia informants, revealed by the Senate yesterday,
includes details of three alleged meetings between Mr Andreotti and senior
Mafia figures in the 1970s. The informants also allege that two
assassinations attributed to the Mafia were carried out on political
instructions from Mr Andreotti.
The murder in 1979 of Mr Mino Pecorelli, a right-wing journalist with links
to the secret services, and that of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa in
1982, the senior Mafia-fighter sent to Palermo, allegedly took place because
both were privy to sensitive information regarding the earlier kidnap and
assassination of former prime minister Aldo Moro.
The request to lift the immunity of Mr Andreotti was made last month by
Palermo magistrates investigating organised crime. This week the magistrates
supplied additional information to support their request after new
interrogations of Mr Tommaso Buscetta and Mr Francesco Marino Mannoia, the
two Mafia informants now under protection in the US.
The two collaborators, who had until recently refused to talk about links
between politicians and crime, also claimed that Mr Salvatore Lima, the
senior Christian Democrat politician in Sicily and member of the European
parliament, liaised with the Mafia on behalf of the Christian Democrats. Mr
Lima, murdered in March 1992, was a close friend of Mr Andreotti and his
main aide in Sicily. It has long been rumoured that his assassination was to
show the Mafia's displeasure with the growing unwillingness of senior
politicians in Rome to comply with its wishes.
Mr Giovanni Pellegrino, chairman of the Senate committee, reacted cautiously
to reports that the new testimony could require the re-opening of
investigations into the assassinations. The new material could be 'an
advance warning of other requests for immunity to be lifted on the part of
other magistrates,' he said.
Unconfirmed press reports yesterday said details of the new testimony,
collected by Mr Giancarlo Caselli, the chief public prosecutor in Palermo,
had been sent to Rome magistrates responsible for investigating the Moro
assassination and the murder of Mr Pecorelli.
Mr Andreotti has presented the 23-man Senate committee with a 66-page
document defending his position. The document casts doubt on the points
raised in the magistrates' allegations. It accuses the magistrates of
persecution, attacks their stand on procedural grounds and casts doubt on
the motives of the Mafia informants. The former prime minister has faced
down 26 previous attempts to have his parliamentary immunity lifted on a
variety of grounds.
Rome magistrates investigating allegations of corruption in aid to
developing countries issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Ferdinando Mach
di Palmstein, a financier associated with the Socialist party. It alleges he
was involved in extortion in connection with aid to Senegal, Argentina and
unspecified other countries.
Separately, Mr Vito Bonsignore, a Christian Democrat junior minister in the
budget ministry, has said he will resign next week. Mr Bonsignore has been
told by magistrates he is under investigation.

FT  15 APR 93 / Guns and butter on the road to Tuzla: Laura Silber travels
the war-devastated route aid officials call Bosnia's Ho Chi Minh trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a Sieg Heil salute, the Croat militia man waves the packed car through
a check point on the road to Tuzla.
Peering through his sun-glasses, he asks the driver for a permit from the
Croatian Defence Council (HVO) allowing him to leave Herceg-Bosna, as they
call the self-styled Croat state.
Emir, a Moslem worker, shows his pass to the militia man, who has a gold 'U'
pinned to his uniform - in honour of the Ustashe, pro-Nazi Croats during the
Second World War.
The latest war has devastated the infrastructure of former Yugoslavia. A
once simple two-hour journey between Tuzla and Belgrade has become a
harrowing three-day expedition in which you have to travel a near circle
around a shattered country patrolled by gunmen. This war is about territory
and control of the roads.
To travel between 'free' Bosnia and Serbia involves a 12-hour drive via
Split on Croatia's Adriatic coast, a flight via Zagreb, and another drive
through Croatia on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, watched over for the past
year by UN peacekeepers.
Passenger cars, battered lorries and white UN vehicles ply the Tuzla road to
and from Split, nicknamed by relief workers the Ho Chi Minh trail.
The road is circuitous, hazardous and above all slow. This lifeline for
Tuzla, a region of some 800,000 people, at some points is little more than a
rutted dirt track.
It weaves through villages which have been all but destroyed by Serb
bombardment. It runs past Mostar, where months of pounding by the Yugoslav
army deliberately reduced to rubble most of the centuries-old mosques and
churches.
An olive green US army bridge now spans the River Neretva, replacing one of
the old stone Turkish bridges, Mostar's trademark, which was knocked out by
Serb mortars.
Croat militia men control more check points on the road than their mainly
Moslem Bosnian counterparts. They have set up a kitchen table in front of
the ruins of Zitomislici, a 16th century Serbian Orthodox monastery, blown
up last year. The guards barely look at the passing cars in an apparent sign
of confidence that they are in control of this vital route.
'This is Croatia, from here to the Adriatic,' says one closely cropped
soldier in a grey uniform. 'It always has been Croatia,' he adds, dismissing
the Bosnian forces on the grounds as too lightly armed.
Rows of freshly dug graves fill parks in Breza, a mostly Moslem town in the
heart of Bosnia.
In anticipation of further Serb bombardments, logs have been used to cover
windows not already shattered in the relentless attacks. Villagers haul
sacks of flour donated by international relief organisations.
Moslem children ask the passing convoys for sweets. Refugees crowded into
houses wave glumly at the lorries. Some sell knitted socks. They are tired
and undernourished. Many have scabies. The blown-up mosques testify to the
destruction of their culture.
The route grows narrow in central Bosnia, running through remote mountain
passes to avoid Serb artillery and front-lines. Traffic jams are frequent as
10-tonne aid lorries slip off the road or get stuck in the mud.
It can take 24 hours to reach Tuzla from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, a
stretch of only 90 miles. Tempers flare as vehicles queue up along the
winding trail. A Bosnian lorry driver pulls a gun on a Danish relief worker
who asks him to back up.
Some locally hired aid trucks have seen better days. But they slog through
the rivulets and pools of mud. One driver has been stuck overnight waiting
for someone to tow his petrol tanker.
'I can't leave because someone may steal the oil,' he says. He appears
pathetically grateful as he is offered an apple and a packet of cigarettes.
The lorries must drive at full speed outside Kladanj, where Serb fighters
bombard the road to Tuzla. It is dubbed 'bomber alley'. Soldiers wearing the
Bosnian fleur-de-lys advise people to drive quickly.
Helmet and flak jacket are needed for the last stretch to Tuzla within easy
reach of Serb guns. The industrial city is almost a reservation, cut off
from the outside world except for one road. Serb and Croat blockades have
stopped almost all traffic but relief lorries.
On the return trip to Belgrade, at a check-point in UN Sector West some 50
miles east of Zagreb, Croat policemen offer coffee.
'Tell them to come over for some ham and Easter cakes,' orders one
policeman. It is unclear to whom he is referring.
'The Jordanians whose checkpoint divides you from the Serbs?' he is asked.
'No, silly, they don't eat pork. Invite the Serbs over for cake.'
With some trepidation the Serb policemen are told that they were invited for
an Easter celebration with their Croat neighbours.
'Hello neighbour,' he bellows over the walkie-talkie. 'Thanks for the
invitation. We'll come over.'
'You bring the beer,' said a Serb militia man.
From there it is down the abandoned Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, once the major
route joining Europe with the Middle East.
It has been a three-day journey back from Tuzla through the former
Yugoslavia. At the roadside just outside Belgrade there is a sign: 'Tuzla
70km'.

FT  15 APR 93 / West Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5%
</HEADLINE>

WEST Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5 per cent in 1993 because of the
continuing international recession, a relatively strong D-Mark and
persistent high domestic costs, the Cologne-based Institute for German
Economy (IW) said yesterday.
The report said the current recession could only be overcome if prospects
for investment and profits improved and the Bundesbank obtained more room
for lowering interest rates.
But it warned that unless domestic costs and price pressure are dampened,
economic recovery would not begin in 1993.
The report came out as figures released by the federal statistics office
showed West Germany's wholesale prices in March increasing by 0.2 per cent
against the previous month.
This follows a similar rise in February and a 0.7 per cent increase in
January.
In mid-March, West Germany's consumer prices were 0.3 per cent higher than
in mid-February, bringing the inflation rate to 4.2 per cent.
In east Germany, consumer prices rose in mid-March by 0.2 per cent to 8.8
per cent.
In its yearly spring report, the IW said investment in machinery and
equipment will fall by 9 per cent in 1993. Only the construction sector
shows an upward trend, increasing by another 1 per cent this year.
The gloomy forecast was partially offset by brighter prospects in the east
where an 'autonomous investment prospect had started.'
Real GDP in eastern Germany can be expected to rise by 6.5 per cent in 1993,
just slightly less than in 1992, the report said.
German state governments had a net financing deficit of DM30.3bn (Pounds
12.4bn) last year, DM12.3bn less than had been foreseen, the German Finance
Ministry said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Bonn.
Mr Jurgen Echternach, parliamentary state secretary, attributed the
better-than-expected result to 'the positive economic development in
Germany, which continued far into last year.'

THE Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday warned it would withdraw support
for the international peace plan if Srebrenica, the besieged town near the
Serbian border, was captured by Bosnian Serb forces.
As reports came in that another eight people had been killed and 21 wounded
in the latest Serb artillery attack on the town on Tuesday night, the
Bosnian Foreign Ministry said: 'The fall of Srebrenica will signal the final
demise of the Vance-Owen plan.'
Under the plan, already signed by Bosnian Croats and Moslems, but rejected
by Serbs, the country would be divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
Srebrenica, surrounded by Serb militia, is in a region which has been
allocated to the Moslems, but which Bosnian Serbs want to absorb into their
territory because it is in a region adjoining the Serbian border.
The renewed attack on Srebrenica, which followed a fierce Serb bombardment
of the centre of the city last Monday during which at least 56 people, many
of them children, were killed, coincided with a fresh diplomatic offensive
by the US and Russia in support of the Vance-Owen plan.
Both the US and Russian special envoys to the Bosnian peace talks, Mr
Reginald Bartholomew and Mr Vitaly Churkin, had talks in Belgrade yesterday
with Serb and Yugoslav leaders, including President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia.
Mr Bartholomew, appointed by President Bill Clinton in February to give a
fresh impetus to the peace effort, emphasised time was running out for
Bosnia's Serbs to sign the plan.
He warned that, while the US was pursuing 'the diplomatic track' for the
moment, it was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the
peace plan. If it failed to do so, Washington would very soon press its
allies to help Bosnian Moslems arm themselves by a partial lifting of the UN
arms embargo.
'The military action must stop, the atrocities in places like Srebrenica
must stop,' Mr Bartholomew said, warning that Serbia would otherwise become
a 'pariah state' subject to the stiffest sanctions ever imposed.
Yugoslav officials said Mr Bartholomew, who also saw Mr Radovan Karadzic,
leader of the Bosnian Serbs, wanted Serbs to come up with concrete proposals
on what modifications they wanted to agree to the peace plan.
Mr Karadzic said he was not ready to sign the plan but that peace was still
possible. 'We are working hard on possible corrections that have been
announced (by US secretary of state Warren Christopher) and we do hope that
we will make some progress.'
However, he made clear he would never concede control of the corridor across
northern Bosnia which links Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia with
Serbia.

FT  15 APR 93 / Sharp fall in Euro car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 9.4 per cent last month as demand
dropped steeply for the third month in succession.
In the first quarter new car sales declined by 17.3 per cent to around
3.06m.
Sales in March declined to 1.18m from 1.3m in the same month a year earlier
according to industry estimates. Demand in March was lower than a year ago
in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe with higher sales registered only in
the UK and in Greece.
The rate of decline moderated in March following steep falls of 23 and 17
per cent in January and February, but leading carmakers are being forced to
lower further their already pessimistic sales forecasts for the full year.
General Motors, the US carmaker, said yesterday it now expected new car
sales in west Europe to fall by 11 per cent to only 11.95m this year from
13.45m in 1992 compared with a 1993 forecast of 12.3m.
In Germany, the single biggest market in west Europe, new car sales fell by
14.9 per cent in March to an estimated 363,000. Sales plunged by 21.7 per
cent in the first quarter.
Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement extensive
short-time working and are cutting workforces in the face of shrinking
profits or mounting losses.
The rate of decline has accelerated in Italy, where new car registrations
fell by 20.8 per cent in March to 190,000.
New car sales in France in March were 9 per cent lower than a year ago,
while demand in Spain dropped steeply by 22.7 per cent.
The only significant relief to the downturn across Europe is being shown in
the UK, where new car sales in March were 12.7 per cent higher than a year
ago. Sales in the first quarter rose by 11.6 per cent.
After plunging by a third during more than three years of recession new car
sales in the UK have been higher than a year ago in each of the last six
months.
Rover, the UK car producer and a subsidiary of British Aerospace,
increased its sales in west Europe by around 11 per cent to 86,000 in the
first quarter supported by a 22 per cent increase in volume in the UK.
Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, which recently disclosed a net loss
of DM1.25bn (Dollars 750m) for the first quarter, suffered a 17.9 per cent
fall in new car sales in west Europe in the first three months to 515,000.
Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of executive and luxury cars, has been
hardest hit with a 29 per cent sales decline in the first quarter.

FT  15 APR 93 / East Germans warned strike could cost 100,000 jobs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 100,000 workers could lose their jobs in eastern Germany if IG Metall,
Germany's engineering union, calls an all-out strike in support of large pay
increases in the region, Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the country's
employers' association, warned yesterday.
At the same time, he asked IG Metall to return, without preconditions, to
negotiations because a strike 'now would be at the wrong time,
inappropriate, and destructive'.
However, IG Metall, which has already held warning strikes in eastern
Germany's steel, metal and electrical sectors, wants the employers'
associations to rescind a decision which ended a contract equalising eastern
and western German wages by April 1994. Under the terms of that contract,
eastern German steel employees were due this year a 21 per cent pay increase
and the metal and electrical sectors 26 per cent.
The union, unsure about the extent of its support for an all-out strike in
eastern Germany, has accused the employers of illegally breaking the
contract. It claims the employers want to destroy the principle of
collective wage bargaining which has shaped industrial relations in Germany
for five decades.
Mr Murmann yesterday denied both charges, saying 'we uphold the principle of
collective wage bargaining.' He also stressed that employers were entitled
to invoke a revision clause in the March 1991 agreement, allowing them to
end the contract because of changed economic circumstances in eastern and
western Germany. He said heavy pay increases, apart from economic reasons,
could not be sustained in view of the fact that other sectors of the eastern
German economy have settled for pay increases of around 9 per cent, in line
with the annual inflation rate in the five eastern German states.

FRANCE'S commercial banks yesterday responded to the recent fall in money
market rates and to Tuesday's reduction in the Bank of France's repurchase
rate by cutting base rates from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur told the National Assembly he would do
'everything possible to make sure this fall in interest rates continues'.
The reduction was triggered on Tuesday night by Credit du Nord and yesterday
followed by other banks. French base rates had been held at 10 per cent
since December as the French authorities battled to defend the franc from
speculative attack in the run-up to last month's parliamentary elections.
The franc has strengthened since the conservatives' return to power and the
announcement last week of Mr Balladur's economic reform package. Yesterday
the D-Mark closed unchanged on the day at FFr3.380. However the French stock
market slipped on profit taking, following its surge on Tuesday. The CAC 40
Index fell by 0.17 per cent to close at 2,015.43.
The base rate reduction is too small to alleviate the pressure on the French
economy, still squeezed by sluggish consumer spending and investment. Mr
Philippe Toussaint, chief executive of Credit du Nord, said the cut was 'an
essential gesture'.

FT  15 APR 93 / Rise in output reinforces signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH EVIDENCE that the UK is emerging from recession came yesterday with
news that manufacturing output increased sharply in February.
Output rose by 1.2 per cent compared with January, the third successive
monthly increase. The rise took manufacturing output to its highest levels
for 18 months and prompted the government to come closer than ever before to
an official declaration that the recession had ended.
The Central Statistical Office figures brought an unequivocal assessment
from 10 Downing Street that the recession was over. A senior official said
it was clear that 'we have a much more broadly based recovery'.
Last night, Mr John Major said: 'We have come through the worst of our
difficulties and very few people now doubt that the economy in this country
is getting better.
'Most of our competitors are still in difficulties or going into
difficulties and that means for British industry and commerce a very
remarkable series of opportunities that lie ahead of us.'
Optimism about the economy was reflected in British Steel's decision
yesterday to announce a second round of price increases for the year. Price
rises announced in January and implemented in recent weeks have been
accepted by customers and fully implemented, unlike last year when they
failed to stick.
The upbeat news was also underlined by a report from the Confederation of
British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. This found that business confidence
in the financial services industries had 'strengthened markedly' for the
second successive quarter. Business volumes had fallen slightly compared
with the previous quarter, but the rate of decline was slowing.
On the foreign exchanges, the much better than expected industrial
production figures prompted gains for sterling although they failed to
inspire share prices.
The sharp month-on-month rise in manufacturing output was backed by a
sustained rise over the three months to February, a measure which gives a
better picture of underlying trends.
According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO, manufacturing
output rose by 1.2 per cent in the three months to February, compared with
the previous quarter. Against the same period a year ago, output was 1.5 per
cent higher.
Speaking in Tokyo at the G7 meeting of foreign and finance ministers, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday's figures were 'excellent
news'.

FT  15 APR 93 / UK to urge curbs on EBRD: Lamont says government made
earlier pleas for greater economy

THE BRITISH government will next week press for tighter controls of spending
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development following disclosure
that it had spent more than Pounds 200m on overheads and equipping its
building in the past two years.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said yesterday he had become so concerned at
the level of spending by the EBRD that the government had frequently called
for greater efficiency and economy in the way the bank was run.
The call for tighter budgetary controls will come at the EBRD's annual
meeting next week and follows disclosures in the Financial Times that the
bank has spent Pounds 55.5m equipping its London headquarters, Pounds
600,000 hiring private jets and Pounds 52,000 on a Christmas party.
The FT disclosed that from April 1991 to the end of last year, the EBRD had
disbursed Pounds 101m in loans and investments against Pounds 201.5m spent
on furnishing its offices, paying staff, travel and administrative
overheads.
Mr Lamont, who represents Britain on the board of governors and is in Tokyo
for the emergency meeting of G7 finance and foreign ministers on aid to
Russia, said he would make sure the government's concerns about efficiency
would be fully considered at the meeting of governors.
The EBRD governors are typically finance ministers from the 53 mostly
western and east European countries, the European Community and the European
Investment Bank, which make up the bank's shareholders.
Mr Lamont said several of the bank's 23 governors, meeting informally, had
voiced concerns about the EBRD's spending in the two years since it was set
up.
He indicated that the concerns were mainly about salary levels, as well as
issues such as the use of private jets to ferry Mr Jacques Attali, the
bank's president and founder, to meetings.
Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the bank's executive director in charge of the budget,
said the bank had become aware that spending on the jets was 'sensitive'.
He introduced a new system for hiring jets 'a few months ago' by which the
bank asks for tenders from three charter companies. All executives except Mr
Attali and senior vice-president Mr Ron Freeman were also told a month ago
to fly economy class.
It also emerged that the bank's 23 directors, who are civil servant
representatives of the shareholders, are pressing for greater control over
the bank's budget-making process.
'There is a lack of transparency and accountability,' a UK official said.
Mr Pissaloux said: 'We are very anxious to respond to requests for any
additional information (from directors).'
Founder European Community shareholders of the EBRD are also expected to use
the bank's annual meeting to quiz Mr Attali about its spending record.
But officials from the European Commission and European Investment Bank,
which together hold 6 per cent of the EBRD's shares, said yesterday they
were sympathetic to the difficulties of funding projects in the economic
chaos of the former eastern bloc.
Mr Lamont said: 'Britain is at the forefront of those calling for economy
and efficiency.' The UK would continue to make such calls, but he noted that
the bank was playing a vital role in the reconstruction of eastern Europe.

Thatcher attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fierce attack by Baroness Thatcher heightened tensions among Tory MPs over
the scale of Britain's involvement in Bosnia and forced the government into
defending its policy. Defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind strongly rejected
the former prime minister's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be allowed to
arm themselves.
Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks,
meanwhile, warned that the US was not prepared to wait much longer for
Serbia to endorse the peace plan. Page 24; Guns and butter on the road to

FT  15 APR 93 / Four die in Soweto as police fire on marchers: Patti
Waldmeir witnesses the bloody end to a peaceful protest over the death of
Chris Hani
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the largest and most peaceful demonstration I had ever seen in Soweto
 -until the shooting started.
Without warning and without apparent provocation, police guarding the main
gate of the police station opened fire on demonstrators protesting at the
assassination of prominent black activist Chris Hani.
Four people were killed and 250 injured by police firing birdshot, buckshot
and rubber bullets. At least six people died across the country during a day
which saw one of the largest political protests in South African history,
marked by rioting in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Pietermaritzburg and Durban.
In Soweto, the black township where violence had erupted in 1976, a huge
crowd of angry but disciplined blacks surrounded the heavily fortified
station.
The mostly young, black and white policemen besieged inside appeared to lose
their nerve; shooting spread down the line guarding the station's barbed
wire perimeter fence. The crowd fled in terror. Thousands of people, scores
of them covered with blood, surged forward.
I took refuge in a car as rocks and teargas canisters flew in the confusion.
Colleagues and I helped to lift a young man, his shirt front soaked with
blood, into the car. Another injured man fought his way inside; many more
people tried to crowd in too. We could not help them.
We raced through the streets to deliver our injured to Baragwanath Hospital
where 250 people lay on stretchers in the car park outside the crowded
examination rooms. The young man moaned in pain, clutching a blood-soaked
rag to his head.
Sixteen years ago Sowetan youths took to the streets in an uprising that, in
many respects, marked the start of the South African rebellion. The fearsome
prospect of impatient angry youngsters going on the rampage, out of control
of the African national Congress marshals, seemed to carry the danger of
South Africa slipping into ungovernability.
It raised the prospect of confrontation with police, unable to contain their
own fear, or to allow the demonstrators to disperse peacefully, which they
had already begun to do when the shooting started.
Earlier a young 'comrade' from the South African Communist party had
celebrated the order and discipline shown by the huge crowd milling outside
the station. 'This is marvellous, fantastic, unbelievable,' he said, clearly
delighted that ANC leaders had managed, against the odds, to control the
angry crowd. Then the shooting started.
The truce which reigns in South Africa at the moment is fragile. 'We wanted
peace, but we can see that they want war,' said an angry young African
National Congress marshal, Rose Malawu, who said two BBC journalists
standing next to her were shot - though she is sure police were aiming at
her. 'Now we are prepared to fight,' she said.
Weston Shabangu, a senior official of the Soweto Civic Association, said he
could see the hatred in police eyes before the shooting started: 'The way
that meeting was so disciplined - I could see that their (the police) hearts
were bleeding.
'They think they are sending a signal that we must think twice before
burying Chris (Hani) in Boksburg white cemetery,' Weston said, shaking his
head.
Earlier, in the day, as we approached the police station in our car, picking
a careful path through thousands of walking demonstrators, scores of
marchers greeted us with smiles, cries of 'Dumela' (a greeting in the Sotho
language); one man called me 'my sister'. Seeing my frightened face, an ANC
marshal stopped to smile and say: 'This is Africa. It's our land. You don't
worry.'
One group of very young men called out the radical slogan 'one settler, one
bullet'; but others nearby shook their heads in disapproval, and smiled at
our car full of white journalists. Everywhere there was anger  - but not at
us, even though we were the only white targets in sight. The demonstrators
made clear they hated the government and the police - not whites for the
simple fact of being whites.
That positive mood was dissipated by the police attack. Chris Hani, who has
already become black South Africa's greatest martyr, is no longer there to
contain the anger.

FT  15 APR 93 / Rail strike looms as talks break up after eight minutes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S railway network is set to be closed down tomorrow by a second
24-hour strike after the breakdown of talks between British Rail and the
main RMT rail union last night.
Talks lasted only eight minutes before breaking up in acrimony. Mr Jimmy
Knapp, RMT's general secretary, accused BR of 'bully-boy tactics' and of
being 'totally intransigent'.
He said Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, had been 'abusive' to him. 'I have never
been treated like that in 35 years in the industry . . . There is no chance
of averting tomorrow's strike.'
Sir Bob said he did not believe the union was 'interested in negotiating a
settlement'. He accused the RMT of playing politics in an industrial
dispute. He was 'very disappointed' at the union's position which he said
had hardened since Tuesday. 'I saw no point in prolonging the meeting,' he
added.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee relations director, accused Mr Knapp in a
letter of following 'a political, not an industrial, agenda' which ignored
the interests of railway workers and focused on the 'narrow sectional
interest' of the RMT's executive.
'Your action is the biggest threat to jobs that the BR board now has to
confront', said Mr Watkinson. He urged Mr Knapp to reconsider calling the
strike.
Sir Bob confirmed that BR - in retaliation for tomorrow's strike - would
scrap the check-off system under which union dues are deducted from railway
worker's pay packets and sent to the unions.
The RMT will have to find another and more expensive way of collecting their
membership subscriptions which bring Pounds 500,000 a month.
The angry exchanges between BR and RMT last night indicate a sharp
escalation in the dispute. Today BR meets the train drivers' union Aslef to
try to resolve their dispute, but it seems likely that Aslef will also go
ahead with its stoppage tomorrow.
Hopes of a settlement of the dispute over union demands of a guarantee for
no compulsory redundancies and use of contract labour faded during the day
as attitudes hardened.
BR expects to lose a further Pounds 10m gross, and freight business
contracts worth Pounds 1bn are at risk, as a result of tomorrow's stoppage.
Last night BR released its final bargaining position. It told the RMT that
it 'did not foresee the need for compulsory redundancy amongst existing
general staff during the next couple of years, providing that staff avail
themselves of the opportunities for redeployment and retraining spelt out in
the various rail agreements and there is full co-operation with any
programmes of voluntary severance.'
BR added that there was less certainty over jobs in the rail workshops,
though every effort would 'continue to be made to avoid any compulsory
discharge of staff'.
It went on to assure the RMT that it had 'no plans for a major extension to
the use of contractors in the area of track maintenance during the next
couple of years'.
BR confirmed there would be no compulsory redundancies over contract work.
Finally, it promised to consult the RMT on preparing track and signalling
maintenance staff to meet the 'emerging requirements' of the railway network
as it underwent privatisation.
Both sides last night accepted that the differences between them over
compulsory redundancies had come down to 'the order of words in a sentence'.
But the RMT continues to insist on a moratorium on contract work, something
BR refuses to accept.

FT  15 APR 93 / US proposes Dollars 4bn fund for Russian economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US tried to assert its leadership of international efforts to bolster
Russian reforms yesterday in launching a plan for a Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) multilateral fund to promote privatisation.
The Clinton administration made the proposal at the opening of a two-day
emergency meeting in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrialised
countries, convened to help strengthen President Boris Yeltsin, the
embattled Russian leader.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, who will attend the talks
today, delivered a warning that the world might 'slide back to cold war'
without continued western financial assistance to promote reform.
The US proposal is aimed at easing the privatisation of large state
enterprises, which are the most difficult to privatise.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the scheme would free
Russia's central bank of some of the burden of converting the huge oil, gas
and other leading industries to private control; save thousands of jobs; and
reduce inflation caused by the bank's issuing of easy credits to state
industries. Mr Bentsen and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
said the US would provide Dollars 500m for the scheme if other G7 countries
provided a total Dollars 1.5bn. The rest would come from international
insititutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
However, German officials indicated that further large pledges of money were
unlikely, as it had already contributed huge sums to Russian reform. A
senior Japanese official said: 'We have already made our best efforts and we
do not expect to be asked for further money.'
Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said that although
the UK agreed with the emphasis on privatisation, 'all G7 members would want
to consider further how best to pursue that aim'. Canadian officials said
the proposal would require more study, while the Italians emphasised that
the privatisation plan was still a US idea.
Details of the plan will be developed during this morning's closing session,
which will be attended by the Russian representatives Mr Kozyrev and Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the deputy primeminister. The G7 meeting is expected to
approve aid worth about Dollars 30bn, most of which will be debt relief and
credit extensions from the IMF that have already been agreed.
Several countries announced new country-to-country assistance yesterday.
Japan confirmed that it was offering Dollars 1.8bn in bilateral assistance,
mainly trade credits.
The UK said it would provide an additional Pounds 383m, while the US said
its contribution to the privatisation fund would be drawn from a Dollars
1.8bn package, details of which are due to be announced today.
Germany, France and Canada said they would not add to existing bilateral
aid. Some ministers complained that 'one-upmanship' was encouraging G7
members to announce ever larger offers, of decreasing effectiveness. One
minister said: 'Our emphasis must be on quality, not quantity.'
The foreign and finance ministers agreed that further aid for Russia should
be conditional upon economic, political and foreign policy reform being made
irreversible.
The meeting agreed that aid should be linked to progress in controlling
inflation; establishing greater discipline at the Russian central bank; and
the restructuring of Russian industry, particularly through the development
of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The other main focus for aid was decommissioning Russian nuclear weapons.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign minister, will today emphasise the
importance of Russia's playing a constructive role in international affairs,
particularly the support for international efforts to end the war in former
Yugoslavia by putting greater pressure on Serbia.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: US stores blame poor weather for
flat sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE severe winter storm that swept across the eastern US last month was
blamed for the generally disappointing March retail sales figures reported
by the largest US store groups last week.
K mart, which takes in a leading chain of discount stores and specialty
retail operations, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in same-store sales last
month, for example.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, managed only a 3 per
cent gain, far below the double-digit increases that investors have come to
expect from the Arkansas-based company.
Sears, Roebuck, another big retail group based in Chicago, also posted a
fall - in this case of 1.4 per cent.
Some of the traditional department stores fared slightly better, however.
May Department Stores managed a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales;
Neiman Marcus posted a 3.8 per cent gain; and Federated Department Stores,
which owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Straus, reported a 2.5 per cent
advance.
But among the specialty retailers, there were some pronounced declines: The
Gap, the San Francisco-based fashion chain whose 'star' reputation has
become somewhat tarnished lately, reported a 6 per cent fall in same-store
sales, for example.
Retailers admitted that the weather might not have been the only influence,
with waning consumer confidence also a factor.
'Uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and the prospect of higher
taxes is translating into lower levels of consumer confidence and a modest
reduction in consumer activity,' said Mr Allen Questrom, chairman of
Federated.
'If these trends continue, they can be expected to have some impact on
retail performance for the remainder of the year,' he added.

FT  14 APR 93 / Long and winding road to recovery: Michael Cassell follows
an export manager to the front lines of the battle to boost UK sales abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ed van Der Heijden tunes his car radio to the BBC while he speeds towards
Antwerp and a hotel bed. A highway exit sign beckons motorists to nearby
Boom as Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, unveils his Budget for sustained
recovery.
There is to be extra help for Britain's exporters. Mr van der Heijden knows
a lot about exporting. He also knows a great deal about deep fryers, coffee
grinders, rice cookers, blenders and mixers. Ask him anything about German
buns, Belgian bread or Danish meatballs. Test him on calibrated food
pushers, juice centrifuges or cordless kettle jugs.
As an export manager for Kenwood, the Hampshire-based manufacturer of food
preparation appliances, Mr van der Heijden, 49, is a mastermind on his
products and his marketplace. That is a requirement of the job if you battle
daily for business against big guns such as Philips, Moulinex, Braun and
Bosch.
Kenwood, with a strong brand name behind it, annually turns out 1.75m
appliances from its Havant factory and survives on exports. Two-thirds of
its Pounds 100m annual sales are made outside the UK, one-third of them in
continental Europe.
At Kenwood's heart is the Chef, a food mixer launched 45 years ago and which
has since whisked and beaten its way into more than 7m kitchens. Something
of a cook himself, Mr van der Heijden talks of the appliance in reverential
tones.
He and his colleagues are at the sharp end of Mr Lamont's calls for an
export-led recovery. His job relies on encouraging and cajoling distributors
and agents to sell Kenwood. His salary is performance-related; fewer sales
mean less take-home pay for him and lower earnings for Britain.
The completion of the single market, with its 344m customers, means little
for companies already well entrenched on the Continent. Trading barriers may
be down but markets are still characterised by wide differences in pricing,
distribution and retailing patterns.
There is no such thing as common pricing. The Chef, for example, costs twice
as much in Switzerland as in the UK. While big, national retailers ease the
logistics of distribution in the UK, a proliferation of small independent
businesses in Germany means more complicated supply chains.
There may have been big strides towards technical harmonisation across the
EC but UK consumers still often find themselves expected to pay extra for a
three-pin plug.
For Kenwood and other British companies selling in Continental Europe, the
more immediate challenge lies not in adapting to structural change but in
winning orders. Deepening recession means shops empty of goods and falling
sales.
But Mr van der Heijden relishes the challenge. His particular patch includes
Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and some former communist countries. A
long-time UK resident, German-born, with a Dutch father and English and
Danish former wives, he can talk small appliances in four languages.
Kenwood's man has today notched up a few more of the 25,000 miles a year he
drives to help win sales. The company's pioneering founder, Kenneth Wood,
may have buzzed about Europe in his own executive aircraft, but Mr van der
Heijden stays firmly on the ground.
When he started, he had to scour Europe for sales in his own, ageing
Mercedes. 'If I did more than 200 miles, my mileage allowance was halved.
Every bit of the route had to be approved in advance, to make sure it was
the shortest.'
In 1989, however, Kenwood's executive directors, led by a former Treasury
official, Tim Parker, organised a management buy-out from Thorn-EMI and last
July the company floated on the London Stock Exchange. Now Mr van der
Heijden has a 5-series BMW and is not afraid to use it.
His long day had begun in the Netherlands at the offices of Beska Nederland,
a Kenwood distributor near Eindhoven owned by Henk Beckmann, whose
ocean-going yacht testifies to his success in importing electrical
appliances.
Nicola, his daughter, is product manager. She says British electrical
products now enjoy the confidence of Continental consumers. 'Kenwood
products are as good as any. Reliability is excellent; prices are stable and
competitive'.
As Mr van der Heijden leaves the room to take a telephone call from a Polish
customer, Mr Beckmann welcomes Kenwood's recent expansion into products such
as shavers and hair dryers. But he adds: 'They left it very late. They were
seen as a one-product company without the range needed to take on the
competition.'
With a Pounds 50,000 order in the bag, Mr van der Heijden returns to explain
that Beska can now import some Kenwood-designed products direct from the
company's new, low-cost production base in China. Quality is guaranteed, he
says, drawing a discreet veil over a recent setback with an early
consignment of Chinese-made coffee-making machines.
Mr Beckmann looks over a draft contract to extend his Kenwood partnership
for another four years. He has one big complaint, shared by other Kenwood
suppliers: 'There is nothing like enough spent on advertising. The
competition spends millions.'
Kenwood accepts the criticism but cannot escape its status as a second
division manufacturer without the financial resources available to big
league players such as Bosch and Braun. Distributors must, therefore, play a
large part in promoting products.
After a quick Taiwanese meal, Mr van der Heijden checks out a huge
electrical superstore at Cuijk. Kenwood products seem swamped; Mr van der
Heijden admires an in-store video promotion by Philips and wants the same.
More store visits follow.
Next morning, he is in Aartselaar, near Antwerp, for a meeting with Jacques
van den Bogaert, the growling proprietor of Asogem, Kenwood's Belgian
distributor.
Thirty years ago, Mr van den Bogaert struck a deal with Kenneth Wood over a
bottle of Scotch. His business now sells more than Pounds 2m of Kenwood
products a year, less than Kenwood sales in France, Austria, Denmark or
Germany, but still an important market.
The conversation is conducted in English, French and Flemish. Mr van den
Bogaert generally holds Kenwood in high regard but reckons it has been slow
off the mark with new products: 'Belgium buys 600,000 coffee-makers a year.
What have I got to offer from Kenwood? - nothing.' Patience, says Mr van der
Heijden, the Kenwood models are on their way.
Mr van den Bogaert is also concerned about Kenwood's prices. 'Why aren't
they reflecting the near-20 per cent devaluation in sterling?' he asks.
Kenwood, Mr van der Heijden reminds his customer, has changed to invoicing
in local currencies in order to stabilise selling prices. 'Devaluation was a
bonus but we bear the risk on currency fluctuations. He didn't phone up
offering to take lower margins when sterling strengthened,' says the export
manager.
Mr van den Bogaert laughs but is not amused. He adds: 'They (the British)
are financially very bright but still not commercial enough.' But Thierry
Vander Elst, Asogem's commercial director, balances the criticism by heaping
praise on the commercial section of the local British consulate: 'It is
excellent. They leave the others standing.'
Lunch at the local tennis club ends in a skirmish about plans to expand the
network of family-run Kenwood dealer centres around Belgium. Asogem had
originally suggested up to 150 but now talks of 75. It is the first Mr van
der Heijden has heard of the plans.
He next drives to Brussegem near Brussels, where Agnes Willems runs just
such a Kenwood centre. She seems unhappy about selling quality products
marked 'Made in China'.
It is early evening and the man from Kenwood is done for the day. He sets
off for the Luxembourg border and another hotel. At the weekend he will be
home to see his 15-year-old daughter and to plan the next trip.
He says he still loves his job, but insists that he works to live, not the
other way round. But ask him for a personal ambition and he instinctively
responds: 'Five per cent of the European market for mens' shavers - that
would be great.'

FT  14 APR 93 / VNU sells print operations to focus on publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VNU, the largest publishing group in the Netherlands, is to sell its
printing division to De Boer Boekhoven, a Dutch printing group, in a cash
and paper deal that will leave it with a 30 per cent stake in the new
printing company.
The transaction will create the largest printing group in the Netherlands,
with annual turnover of Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 665m). It will enable VNU to
concentrate on its core publishing activities, in line with a strategy
pursued successfully by Elsevier and Wolters-Kluwer, the Netherlands' other
two dominant publishing groups, since the early 1980s.
VNU is to receive Fl 100m in cash, shares worth Fl 19m and 1.88m five-year
warrants in De Boer Boekhoven. It will provide the new printing group with a
Fl 40m subordinated loan and a Fl 18m convertible bond. Last month, it took
a Fl 80m charge on 1992, reflecting expectations that it would sell its
printing division for less than book value.
Mr Joep Brentjens, VNU's chairman, said VNU intended to hold its stake at
around 30 per cent, which means that it may sell shares that it gains
through the conversion of loans or exercise of warrants.
De Boer Boekhoven is only one-third the size of the printing activities that
it will be acquiring from VNU. The Fl 100m in cash is to be provided by a
banking consortium led by ABN AMRO, which owns 42 per cent of De Boer
Boekhoven.
When VNU announced in 1990 that it planned to sell all or part of its
printing activities, expectations were high that the company would find a
foreign buyer. However, talks with other potential buyers had been upset by
the currency turmoil in Europe in the autumn, which changed the outlook for
export orders.
The new printing company, which has yet to be given a name, will benefit
from the receipt of long-term printing contracts from VNU, the largest
publisher of consumer magazines in both the Netherlands and Belgium.
Other customers are publishers of radio and television guides, as well as
international magazines such as Time, Newsweek and The Economist, which have
part of their international circulations printed in the Netherlands.

FT  14 APR 93 / Morocco plans petrol station sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   RABAT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Moroccan government is offering its 50 per cent stake in seven petrol
station networks to domestic and foreign investors, Reuter reports from
Rabat. It plans to sell off its stake in a total of 112 enterprises worth
Dh35bn (Dollars 4bn) by 1995, including distributors of petroleum products.
The seven networks are Mobil Oil, Shell, Total, Dragon-Gaz, Societe Petroles
du Maghreb (Petrom), Societe Marocaine de Stockage (SOMAS), and the
Compagnie Marocaine des Hydrocarbures (CMH). They are capitalised at Dh360m.
Petrom shares worth Dh122.4m and CMH shares worth about Dh100m are among
those on offer. Societe Nationale des Produits Petroliers (SNPP), the state
agency, holds 51 and 50 per cent in the two companies. Bids close on May 12.
'In 1992, domestic sales (of petroleum products) were between Dh12bn and
Dh14bn, an increase of 12.6 per cent compared with 1991,' the mines and
energy ministry said.
The SNPP owns 50 per cent of the seven companies to be privatised and
controls 75 per cent of the Moroccan petroleum distribution market. It was
set up in the 1970s when the authorities launched a 'Moroccanisation'
programme to avoid multinational control of the distribution network.
'The government is preparing a large-scale return of multinationals to the
strategic oil sector,' the opposition daily Al Bayane said. However,
officials deny foreigners will control the oil industry. Mr Moulay Zine
Zahidi, privatisation minister, said yesterday: 'The state is responsible
for crude oil imports and the SNPP and other companies distribute refined
products only.'
Officials said the state-owned oil refineries at Mohammedia, near
Casablanca, and at Sidi Kacem, north-east of Rabat, were strategic
enterprises and not for sale.
When the oil distribution companies have been sold, the SNPP will return to
its status before 'Moroccanisation' and will also be privatised.
SNPP, whose oil stock at the end of last year was worth an estimated Dh2bn,
will probably take over gas distribution when the trans-Maghreb pipeline
taking Algerian natural gas across Morocco to Europe is completed in 1995,
analysts said.

FT  14 APR 93 / Bank of France faces battle to keep its powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France plays a bigger role in its national economy than any
other European central bank. Its 17,000 employees implement monetary policy,
regulate commercial banks, compile corporate data, run the payments clearing
system, even provide management advice to industry and conduct some private
banking.
But French politicians will soon decide whether some of the bank's roles
should be hived off to a separate authority. Mr Edmond Alphandery, finance
minister, has said he will produce a draft statute on the bank's future by
the end of this week, which he expects parliament to pass before the summer
break.
The Maastricht treaty dictates that national central banks must be made
independent in the transition to economic and monetary union (Emu), with
their board members having 'irrevocable' tenure for at least five years and
being forbidden to 'solicit or accept' instructions from outside bodies. The
treaty is, however, silent on what other roles independent central banks
should have, beyond conducting monetary policy.
It is in this grey area that bureaucratic battle has begun between the Bank
of France, which naturally wants to move into its new era of independence or
autonomy with all its powers intact, and other institutions, notably the
influential Tresor department of the finance ministry, which sees merit, not
to say self-interest, in slimming down the 'Old Lady' on the Rue de la
Vrilliere.
The odds are the central bank will keep its present powers. This was indeed
the provision in the draft statute produced earlier this year by the UDF
party in the ruling conservative coalition, from which Mr Alphandery hails.
However, the finance minister has chosen, as the director of his private
office, a Tresor official, Mr Christian Noyer, who has openly suggested that
the central bank suffers from a potential conflict of interest between its
job of controlling liquidity and its role of lender-of-last-resort.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Bank of France governor, said he saw no reason to
remove banks from his supervision. Mr de Larosiere said the split in Germany
between a Bundesbank in charge of monetary policy and a Berlin office
responsible for supervising banks was more apparent than real, since the
latter institution was dependent on the former.
The French Association of Banks does not have a formal view on who should
best regulate its members. Most banks seem to favour the devil they know
intimately (the Bank of France), rather than one they know less well (the
Tresor), or not at all (in the case of some new body).
One solution, suggested by an adviser to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,
would be to leave day-to-day bank supervision with the Bank of France, with
its network of 212 branches and data base on banks and their clients.
The same network enables the central bank, its officials claim, to intervene
at the first sniff of trouble. They cite the fact that the Bank of France -
and the Banking Commission which Mr de Larosiere chairs - stepped in to
inspect the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) France in
October 1990, and to forbid BCCI taking deposits from French residents in
January 1991, months before that banking scandal blew up publicly.
By contrast, the Bank of France should perhaps play less of a role in the
Banking Regulation Committee, of which Mr de Larosiere is vice-chairman,
because of the potential for divided interests. The committee sets rules
which the Banking Commission enforces, among which are the level of
non-interest bearing reserves which commercial banks must place with the
Bank of France. 'But the level of these reserves affects the central bank's
profits,' notes the Balladur adviser.

FT  14 APR 93 / Fininvest poised to raise cash by activities merger
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FININVEST, the privately-owned media and financial services group of Italy's
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is poised to raise cash by merging and floating its
main publishing activities.
The scheme, which has yet to be given a formal go-ahead by Mr Berlusconi,
involves merging Silvio Berlusconi Editore, Fininvest's magazine publishing
and industrial printing business, with Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher,
which Fininvest controls.
Shares in the amalgamated unit, which would have annual sales of about
L2,000bn (Dollars 10m), would be offered to domestic and international
investors, with Fininvest retaining 51 per cent. The proceeds would be used
to bring down the group's debts, officially about L3,000bn, although some
bankers put the total higher.
'We are looking seriously at these hypotheses, but no final decision has
been made,' said Fininvest.
The group has steered clear of some of the over-ambitious takeovers which
have driven other international media concerns into difficulties, and has
not visibly suffered from the recession. However, Mr Adriano Galliani, head
of its television interests, and one of Mr Berlusconi's main lieutenants,
said it was 'in a consolidation phase'. Indirect confirmation that
preparations for the deal are well under way came with news last weekend
that SBE had bought 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares from the
Fininvest parent company.
No price for the intra-group transaction was disclosed. However, the
transfer has been seen as a first step to the merger between the two
publishing operations later this year.
Goldman Sachs and Banca Commerciale Italiana have been appointed to advise
on the deal. However, bankers note that Mr Berlusconi, on whom the ultimate
decision rests, has not yet fully committed himself.
Two years ago, the widely-expected flotation of Fininvest's Silvio
Berlusconi Communications film subsidiary was shelved because of opposition
from Mr Berlusconi, who remains hostile in principle to the participation of
outside shareholders in his activities. However, bankers believe a
cash-raising exercise is much more likely now in view of the greater
financial pressures on his group.
The merger of SBE with Mondadori is likely to come through a reverse
takeover, which would precede placing a large proportion of the shares in
the combined unit.
SBE is best known for publishing Italy's biggest-selling magazine, TV
Sorrisi e Canzoni and a new magazine, Noi. The company made net profits of
L29.7bn on sales of L320bn in 1992.
Mondadori is Italy's biggest book publisher, and also has sizeable magazine
interests, including Panorama, the country's biggest-selling news magazine.
Sales amounted to L1,600bn last year.
Fininvest gained control of Mondadori's book and magazine interests after a
long-running battle for control between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De
Benedetti at the end of which Mondadori was split, with Mr Berlusconi
retaining its publishing and magazines.
Although still listed, Fininvest controls almost 90 per cent of its ordinary
shares and 80 per cent of its savings stock. Mondadori's share price has
risen sharply this year on rumours of a deal.
Bankers believe up to 40 per cent of the shares being sold could be placed
with foreign investors, explaining the role of Goldman Sachs in the
transaction. However, in contrast to the planned flotation of Fininvest's
film interests, which had been slated for the New York Stock Exchange, the
SBE listing would only involve Milan.

FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued speculation of a dividend cut at Forte, which is due to announce
full-year results tomorrow, weakened the shares. They closed 2 adrift at
181p. There were also renewed rumblings over a possible rights issue to
reduce the hotel group's high debt, although most leisure specialists
believe it is likely to happen until later in the year.
However, further evidence of how gloomy the market has become over the
short-term prospects for the stock was seen in the traded options market
where one leading securities house bought put options suggesting that
Forte's shares will be below yesterday's closing price in two months time.
Among banks, participation in the BT3 sale continued to boost SG Warburg and
the shares improved 9 to 658p. Merchant bank Hambros gained 7 to 331p, with
dealers focusing on the improved prospects for Hambro Countrywide which may
benefit from the recovering housing market.
The composite insurers were carried by the strong market trend with a sell
recommendation on Sun Alliance the only noteable feature. Mr David Nisbet at
NatWest Securities believes the 'shares are overpriced an should be either
switched within the sector or sold.' He suggested that Royal Insurance
Holdings and Commercial Union may offer a better investment opportunity and
dealers reported switching activity during the course of the day. Sun
Alliance closed at 349p xd. Royal hardened a penny to 307p, while CU
advanced 17 to 628p. Also wanted was General Accident up 19 at 613p.
A detailed research note from Hoare Govett on Granada Group helped the
shares gain 2 to 395p. Analyst Mr Hamish Dickson argued that Granada was one
of the few companies that offered investors the opportunity to 'deliver two
to three years of significant earnings growth regardless of whether or not
the UK economy improves.' He believes the shares have an upside of 450p.
International drinks stocks were lifted by a combination of confidence over
UK, European and Japanese recovery. Allied Lyons gained 10 to 562p, Grand
Metropolitan 5 to 428p and Guinness 15 to 482p.
Water stocks were among the worst performers in the market as broker advice
and press comment drew attention to the sector's relative high rating. This
combined with the shift of mood away from defensive and into recovery stocks
sent the shares down. Kleinwort Benson was among those advising clients to
'reduce holdings' in the sector. Anglian declined 8 to 538p, Thames 6 to
550p and Wessex 3 to 638p.
Oil shares substantially underperformed the rest of the UK market despite
big gains in oil shares on Wall Street overnight. The strength of sterling
was put forward as one of the prime restraining factors.
BP settled marginally easier ar 304 1/2 p after relatively good turnover of
6.9m with the market still reacting to last week's hints that the company's
latest well in Colombia has proved dry.
Vodafone Group resisted the mood in a positive telecoms sector, the shares
standing steady at 388p. Smith New Court revised its profits forecasts,
shaving Pounds 5m from this year's to Pounds 320m and moving to Pounds 350m
the year after. The securities house blames increased start-up costs
overseas for the cut.
Bargain hunters were seen in BAT helping the shares gain 13 to 900p. Also in
demand were Williams Holdings and Tomkins. The former gained 8 to 335p,
while the latter finished 9 better at 253p.
The recent overhang of stock in Siebe appeared to have been cleared leaving
the shares to move strongly ahead. An initial retreat gave way to good
buying and a squeeze was later seen. The shares closed 15 better at 465p,
with volume having reached 1.6m.
Continued speculation that British Aerospace will soon announce a Pounds
500m order for Hawk aircraft from Indonesia helped the shares finish 5 up at
278p. TI Group added 5 to 310p, boosted by a buy recommendation from BZW.
Favourable weekend press comment on VSEL saw the shares jump 15 to 650p.
Dividend hunters sought out Booker, shares in the food manufacturing and
distribution group bounding forward 11 to 382p. Unilever rebounded from last
week's downgradings, the shares closing 11 ahead at 1126p.
Food retailers, shunned by investors in recent weeks on price war fears,
also caught the recovery mood. Asda added 1 1/2 to 67 1/2 p, with Robert
Flemings suggesting that the company's new format stores will produce good
trading news.
Elsewhere, J Sainsbury lifted 14 to 472p, while Tesco rose 5 to 230p.
DIY stocks initially bounded forward but faded as talk was heard that
reports of strong sales had been overdone. Do It All owner WH Smith slipped
3 to 420p, while B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher was held to a rise of 5 to 590p.
Ladbroke, owner of Texas, added 3 to 175p.
In the transport sector, UK airports operator BAA revealed a 6.2 per cent
year on year improvement in March passenger traffic. The shares closed 10
better at 793p.

FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: HK lift for C&amp;W
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that talks were to resume between the UK and Chinese authorities
over the future of Hong Kong sent related shares sharply forward on the
London market yesterday. Among the best performers was Cable and Wireless,
helped also by a weighty tome from Hoare Govett and a positive note from
NatWest Securities. The shares jumped 17 to 747p in turnover of 2.9m.
Hoare's predicts earnings growth of 16 per cent per annum between now and
1996-7, while productivity and efficiency improvements are forecast to add
Pounds 50m to annual profits. The securities house also draws attention to
the growth potential for Hong Kong Telecom in the Pacific Rim. In
reiterating its positive stance, NatWest also drew attention to C&amp;W's low
relative weighting due to weakness in the first quarter as Hong Kong worries
overhung the stock.
Elsewhere, HSBC climbed 13 to 623p, Standard Chartered 11 to 709p and
Inchcape 5 to 601p.

FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by US sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGATIVE remarks from a leading US fund manager over the outlook for Glaxo,
published on Monday in a Wall Street financial newspaper, sent shares in the
UK pharmaceutical group into reverse and renewed worries over the future of
its leading drug, Zantac.
In the article, the fund manager suggested that Glaxo's reliance on its
anti-ulcer product - which supplies nearly half of group profits - was
worrying given the threat of competition, recent regulatory concerns and the
lack of other lines coming through for development. A 40 per cent fall in
Glaxo's ADR price was predicted in the article.
The reaction of UK drugs analysts was more sanguine. Mr Andrew Porter at
Nikko said that the article was further evidence of the anxiety among the US
investment community over President Clinton's plans for drug prices, yet to
be announced. 'Today's fall has been overdone,' he said, 'and represents an
excellent opportunity to get into the stock.' The shares fell 19 to 553p in
turnover of 8.4m, the most heavily traded stock of the day.
It was announced yesterday that the number of shares held by US investors
has fallen by almost 1 per cent since last November, down from 23.8 per cent
to a current level of 22.95 per cent, or 695m shares.

FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of further reductions in interest rates and a feeling that the UK
economic recovery was at last on the way together led to an active day
derivatives trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the strong opening in dealings in the June contract on the FT-SE
100 at 2,846 - some 11 points above its close last Thursday - was clear
evidence of the positive mood in the market.
The contract advanced steadily throughout the morning, pulling the
underlying equity market higher along the way, though turnover remained
thin. By 12.30pm the June contract was trading at the day's high of 2,870.
A period of sideways trading then followed but the June contract continued
to trade at the higher levels boosted by the firm opening on Wall Street but
a slight bout of profit-taking was seen towards the close.
The June contract finished at 2,865, up 34 on its previous close and around
9 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 11. Turnover was poor
with a mere 6,328 lots dealt by the close.
In traded options, volume reached 29,715 lots, with 8,512 contracts of that
total dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and 5,071 lots in the Euro FT-SE 100
option.
Among stock options, Glaxo was the most active with a day's total of 2,437
trades. It was followed by J Sainsbury at 1,596.

FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally as pound strengthens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPRESSIVE performances from most of the world's bigger stock markets plus a
strong showing by sterling and and an improving outlook for international
interest rates brought a halt to six consecutive downside trading sessions
on London's equity market. Vague suggestions that a predator could be
constructing a sizeable takeover bid helped sentiment in some of the
so-called bid targets.
Adding to a generally optimistic mood in London was an exceptionally strong
performance by companies heavily involved in Hong Kong after it was
announced that the UK and Chinese governments are to resume talks on April
12 about the colony's elections scheduled for 1994/5.
The only disappointing aspect of an otherwise positive day on the London
market was the low level of actual business transacted as the market moved
back into action after the long Easter holiday break.
The FT-SE 100 index closed the session at 2,846.8, clawing back 25 points of
the 56.6 it had fallen over the previous six trading days. Another highlight
of the session was the outperformance by the 100-share index of the FT-SE
Mid 250 index which closed only 17 points up at 3,101.3.
The performances by the Wall Street and Tokyo markets during London's
closure over the holiday period ensured that London would open on a positive
note. Wall Street's 31-point rise on Monday and a much needed rally in the
US bond market after better than expected inflation news at the end of last
week, were viewed by London dealers as real boosters to market confidence.
So,too, was the Pounds 79bn package unveiled by the Japanese government
designed to kick-start the Japanese economy.
The Footsie 100 index opened more than two points higher and progressed
smoothly to reach the day's high, up 26.2 at 2,848.0, ahead of the opening
of Wall Street. Sterling's latest rise plus a reduction in one of the French
interest rate instruments prompted renewed talk that a cut in German
interest rates, and possibly another reduction in UK rates, may not be too
far away.
The latest UK economic data - producer price figures for March - announced
in mid-morning was much in line with estimates and had little impact on the
market. This morning will see the official figures on industrial output for
February while inflation figures for March are scheduled for Friday. A near
20-point jump on Wall Street shortly after the opening failed to produce
fireworks in London and the Footsie 100 index, after reaching the day's
high, moved narrowly for the rest of the session.
There were, however, a number of poor performing areas of the market with
the recently bruised and battered drug sector worst hit. A bearish report on
Glaxo in one of the leading US newspapers saw the shares retreat further
with matters hardly helped by news that US investors have been continuing to
lighten their holdings.
Water stocks, among the market's best performers over the past year, were
upset by press comment.
Dealers were relieved at the extent of the market's rally yesterday, but
pointed out that the Footsie was due for a substantial rise against a
backdrop of very positive news.
Turnover, always expected to be low, was 419.5m shares. The value of
customer business on Thursday was Pounds 1.06bn.

FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy rebounds on hopes of a recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a week shortened by the Easter holiday break, Italy emerged with strong
gains as investors reacted to comments by the governor of the Bank of Italy
that the economy was showing signs of recovery.
Japan was another significant feature with the Nikkei average breaking
through the 20,000 barrier during trading on Thursday before closing
slightly below, but still at a new year's high.
The gains in Italy were also encouraged by the government's restatement,
towards the end of the week, of its determination to press ahead with its
privatisation programme, together with final cabinet approval of the law on
private pensions.
But it was the growing belief that economic recovery was under way which
really provided buying stimulus, at least among domestic investors. Some
analysts noted that foreign institutions remained absent last week as they
awaited this weekend's referendum on constitutional changes.
Cautioning against too much optimism, Goldman Sachs in its regular monthly
strategy note comments that 'on earnings the Italian equity market
(short-term) still looks overvalued by about 27 per cent and faces a
difficult reporting season'.
On a longer perspective, Goldman says that 'the upside largely depends on
how long it takes to build a perceived stable political equilibrium through
new elections. Great emphasis should also be put on the 1994 budget law and
(the government's) ability to sustain the fiscal discipline recently
introduced'.
While Spain was not a feature last week, the decision by Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the prime minister, on Monday to call a snap election for June 6 could
provide a short-term boost for equities. Mr Victor Galliano of Baring
Securities comments that pressure on the peseta may lead to lower interest
rates, even before polling day.

FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Higher bond prices help lift
US equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FOR the second day running US stock markets moved higher in tandem with
government bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.94 at 3,444.05. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.86 higher at 449.23, while
the Amex composite finished up 2.43 at 420.51, and the Nasdaq composite up
0.71 at 673.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was 286m shares.
Once again, rising bond prices and falling yields helped stock market
sentiment, even though part of the upward momentum in bonds came from bad
news on retail sales, which fell 1.0 per cent in March.
Ultimately, however, bond prices were rising steadily because recent news on
consumer and producer prices allayed fears that inflationary pressures have
been building up in the economy.
Stocks were also boosted by big gains in overseas markets, notably in Tokyo,
where the main index jumped 4.3 per cent after the Japanese government
unveiled an ambitious fiscal stimulus package aimed at helping the ailing
economy.
The market held its form even after bond prices fell back mid-afternoon,
with prices supported by some program buying. Brokerage and investment
banking stocks were in particularly good form, lifted by news of another
quarter of record earnings at the securities industry's biggest company,
Merrill Lynch, which reported profits of Dollars 342m for the period, up 57
per cent on a year earlier.
The earnings helped Merrill shares rise Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 in
busy trading. Also firmer were PaineWebber up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 27
1/4 , Morgan Stanley Dollars 2 5/8 higher at Dollars 64 7/8 , Dean Witter
Discover Dollars 1 1/8 stronger at Dollars 38 1/8 , and JP Morgan up Dollars
2 at Dollars 72 3/8 . while Primerica rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 49.
Motorola remained buoyed by Monday's news, released after the close of
trading, of strong first quarter earnings. The stock rose more than Dollars
2 initially, before dropping back to end up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 1/8
in volume of 3.2m shares.
Other big computer issues were flat or weaker, with IBM down Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 49 3/8 , Digital Equipment Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 39 7/8
and Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 at Dollars 74 5/8 .
Other notable stocks to be aided by first quarter earnings were Westinghouse
Electric, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 1/4 , and CBS, Dollars 7 1/8 higher
at Dollars 237 1/8 .
Citicorp rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 as reports continued to
circulate that Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the bank's largest individual
shareholder, had sold almost 9m shares on Monday.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed higher in heavy trading. According to
preliminary figures, the TSE 300 index rose 9.83 points, or 0.27 per cent,
to close at 3,624.84.
Newbridge Networks jumped 4 to CDollars 76. SoundView Financial Group of New
York rated Newbridge a "buy" for the short term and a "hold" for the long
term in its rating of the stock.

EQUITIES climbed by 4.3 per cent to a new 1993 peak as the announcement of
Japan's Y13,200bn supplementary budget to resuscitate the economy triggered
active buying from dealers, arbitragers and public fund managers, writes

The Nikkei average closed 858.15 higher at 20,740.29, after reaching an
intraday high of 20,753.74 during the final minutes of trading and opening
at its session low of 19,902.42. The last time the average closed above this
level was March last year.
Volume shot up again to 750m shares compared with Monday's 336.6m. Advances
overwhelmed declines by 1,055 to 65, with 66 unchanged, the Topix index of
all first section issues rose 53.35 to 1,608.76 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.75 to 1,268.43.
Traders had initially expected share prices to fall since the stimulus
package, although the largest ever, was in line with expectations. However,
hopes of a sustained bullish trend offset concerns over weak economic
fundamentals.
Mr Ryoji Tanaka, head of Japanese equity trading at Kidder Peabody
International, said that most investors believed that additional buying will
enter the market as the Nikkei average has settled above the 20,000 level.
Large-capitalisation stocks were bought aggressively, with Nippon Steel, the
most active issue of the day, settling Y16 higher to Y409 while Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries rose Y27 to Y682.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the recent market rally,
closed up Y40,000 at a session high of Y1.07m. Reports that the fiscal
package announced yesterday included government investments in
telecommunications infrastructure encouraged broadly based buying in the
sector. Nippon Comsys, the telecommunications engineer, soared Y130 to
Y1,400. Electric wire and cable issues were also strong with Fujikura up Y40
to Y1,040 and Furukawa Electric rising Y23 to Y724.
Exporters were higher in spite of the higher yen. Hitachi rose Y39 to Y908,
Sony gained Y200 to Y5,000 and Toyota Motor advanced Y50 to Y1,740.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 660.89 to settle at 22,113.38 in volume of
33m shares.
Roundup
WIDELY divergent routes were taken by equity markets around the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG went into a slow burn. Shares surged 2.1 per cent in anticipation
of the announcement, which came after the market closed, of a resumption of
Sino-British talks on the colony's future. The Hang Seng index rose 132.54
to 6,418.21 as turnover improved slightly to HKDollars 2.54bn.
The mood subsequently carried over into London trading of Hong Kong shares.
HG Asia in London said that prices peaked at the equivalent of a further 300
point rise in the Hang Seng before settling to close 275 ahead at 6,693. One
analyst said: 'This was a big surge for trading in London but we are used to
this kind of volatility.'
Gains in Hong Kong were recorded across the board, with banks and utilities
leading the way. HSBC Holdings, which topped the actives list, climbed
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69.50 and Hong Kong Telecom rose 20 cents to
HKDollars 10.
Jardine Matheson bounced HKDollars 2 higher to HKDollars 48 on hopes of a
thaw in Sino-British relations. There was also talk of disposal of its
Hongkong Land subsidiary, on which the group declined comment.
AUSTRALIA closed at a 17-month high, taking its lead from the strength of
the Japanese and US markets. The All Ordinaries index rose 23.0 to 1688.7,
its highest since November 11, 1991.
BOMBAY ended with slight gains in a declining market on intervention by the
state-owned Unit Trust of India. The BSE index rose 13 to 2,235, having
fallen in early trading to a 14-month low of 2,175.
KARACHI closed lower on political uncertainty after the resignations of two
more cabinet ministers and the 100-share index ended 15.53 down at 1,094.11.
SEOUL failed to maintain the momentum that took shares to an 18-month high
on Monday and the composite index edged 0.44 lower to 720.52 in turnover of
Won807.9bn after Monday's Won933.2bn.
SINGAPORE was prey to profit-taking after last week's rally and the Straits
Times Industrial index shed 14.33 to 1,693.51.
TAIWAN was lower for the fifth straight day in thin turnover. The weighted
index spent most of the session moderately easier before a late wave of
selling pushed it down 84.61 or 1.8 per cent to 4,597.66.

FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French interest rate cut
signals further reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES offered a limited response to the overnight strength in the US and
Japanese equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Anthony Thomas, European strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that
Europe, these days, is looking inward much more than before, influenced by
the German recession on one hand and by the fall in continental interest
rates, on the other.
PARIS reacted to the cut in the 5-10 day repo rate with a 1.6 per cent gain
in the CAC-40 index which closed 31.22 higher at 2,018.08. While the 2
percentage point cut had been anticipated last week, the market now expects
a decrease in intervention rates, perhaps before the weekend. The central
bank's decision reflected the resilience of the franc, which many
commentators had expected to come under pressure in the currency markets as
speculators tested the new government's commitment to the franc fort policy.
March inflation figures, much in line with expectations, also supported
trading in average turnover of FFr2.3bn.
Interest-rate sensitives were among the best performers with SocGen gaining
FFr13 to FFr644, Paribas FFr8.80 to FFr424.80 and Credit Local FFr24 or 6
per cent to FFr429.
FRANKFURT registered its biggest gains in a month as the DAX index closed
15.32 higher at 1,671.05, but opinions on the market continued to conflict.
Turnover was reported to have been thin. Financials were strong as bond
markets rose following the decline in US bond yields, Deutsche Bank rising
DM8.80 to DM707.40, although dealers said that the DM35 gain to DM2,220 in
Allianz reflected a buy signal in the stock's chart pattern.
Car stocks moved up, down and sideways, reflecting disagreement between
German financial advisers like Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, which puts the
sector in the reduce/underweight category, and Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt,
which has gone for an overweight position now that comprehensive
cost-cutting measures are in hand in the industry.
Daimler rose DM4.20 to DM569.20 after an intraday peak of DM576.00; BMW lost
50 pfennigs to DM484 after an intraday high of DM487.50; and Volkswagen
ended with a gain of DM1 at DM312.
MADRID rose on Wall Street's strength and the view that the early general
election might remove some of the uncertainties facing the market - although
some analysts demurred, saying that a close-fought campaign could create
more problems than it solved.
The general index rose 2.51 to 239.00. There were gains of up to, and over
10 per cent in constructions where Cubiertas ended Pta700 higher at Pta7,300
and FCC rose Pta510 to Pta9,620 on a Pta658bn hydrological plan to redirect
water resources to the drought ridden south.
ZURICH began firmly on hopes of lower interest rates, but the advance was
not sustained as worries about the effect of a firmer Swiss franc weighed on
the prospects for exporters. The SMI index finished 6.5 lower at 2,181.8.
Among export oriented companies, Nestle bearers slipped SFr5 to SFr1,165
while Roche certificates eased SFr20 to SFr4,170.
Banks and insurers were the beneficiaries of lower rate hopes. CS Holding
bearers firmed SFr10 to SFr2,410, recouping early losses which followed
Thursday's news that Moody's had downgraded the long-term debt of Credit
Suisse.
AMSTERDAM followed the general trend with a gain in the CBS Tendency index
of 0.7 to 108.6. VNU put on 80 cents to Fl 112.10 ahead of confirming after
the close that it had reached agreement to sell its printing division.
MILAN moved ahead from the start before gains were pared by technical
trading ahead of today's expiry of options contracts. The Comit index ended
0.92 higher at 513.01.
Privatisation stocks were mixed in further response to last Thursday's
sell-off timetable. Among candidates due to be sold by May, Credito Italiano
fell L60 to L2,650 while Sme gained L60 to L5,990.
STOCKHOLM edged ahead in thin trading and the Affarsvarlden Index rose 2.3
to 996.9.
Volvo B shares added SKr10 to SKr382 following news at the weekend that its
North American truck operations had returned to profit.
Hennes and Mauritz, the clothing retailer, added SKr10 or 5 per cent to
SKr208 after Mr Stefan Persson, the majority shareholder, agreed to accept
SKr800m of company shares in payment for the SKr1bn convertible debenture
loan that he holds.
DUBLIN took its gains further, the ISEQ overall index closing 28.92, or 1.92
higher at 1,551.36, on anticipation of yet another rate cut this Friday, and
on indications of improved cash flow at domestic institutions - meaning that
they had no need to sell into continued foreign buying of the market.
TEL AVIV rose in strong trading with a gain in the index of 4.72 or 2.3 per
cent to 215.44.

JOHANNESBURG fell following Saturday's assassination of the Communist Party
chief and ANC national executive member, Mr Chris Hani. The overall index
fell 60 to 3,529, heavily influenced by golds which shed 47, or 3.7 per cent
to 1,217.
The industrial index closed 17 lower at 4,352. Dealers said that a major
sell-off had been avoided, but that tomorrow's general stayaway, called by
the African National Congress, was expected to dictate short term direction.

FT  14 APR 93 / Money Markets: Futures tightly traded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL small pieces of positive economic news failed to break through the
post-holiday lethargy yesterday and both the money and financial futures
markets generated scant enthusiasm, writes Peter John.
An announcement that the French upper-limit emergency lending rate was to be
cut by two percentage points to 10 per cent prompted some buying of Pibor
futures.
However, dealers soon appreciated that the rate was so far out of line with
the overnight lending rate that the cut made little difference. In spite of
an optimistic statement from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new economics
minister, predicting further interest rate falls, the contract for June
delivery settled unchanged at 91.81 on low turnover.
The news from France gave heart to some of the perennial optimists banking
on the Bundesbank to produce a rate cut with more substance than what has
been described as the 'salami-slicing' of recent months. The Euromark
contract for June was bought up three basis points to a high of 92.91 but
the sceptics prevailed and it settled slightly down on the day.
Finally, in the UK, a stronger pound combined with economic data to signal
that underlying inflationary pressures might remain distant for some time.
However neither pointer was strong enough to take short sterling anywhere
but the doldrums and the June contract settled three basis points lower at
92.84 on desultory turnover of less than 10,000 contracts.
Dealing in the money markets was also gentle with an end to the large
shortages forecast last week. The Bank of England forecast an early shortage
of Pounds 250m, later revised to around Pounds 350m, of which Pounds 215m
was taken up.
German call money firmed to 8.25/30 per cent, up sharply from Thursday's
8.10/20 per cent as tax payments drained liquidity from the banking system.
Traders said they expected the Bundesbank to relieve the upward pressure by
allocating DM78bn to DM84bn marks in this week's repo tender, thus adding
DM4bn to DM10bn in funds to the market. They see the minimum allocated rate
easing to 8.10 per cent from 8.13 per cent. Reserves on deposit with the
Bundesbank rose to DM60.1bn from DM56.3bn on Monday, bringing the average to
DM56.8bn for the first six days of April.

FT  14 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides on poor sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING retail sales figures from the US imposed further pressure on
an already ailing US dollar, which was weaker across the board yesterday,
and suffered a sharp fall against the D-Mark, writes Peter John.
Economists had expected the March sales figures to be poor but had,
nevertheless, anticipated a slight rise. When the news broke that they had
actually fallen by one per cent against the previous month the dollar
tumbled through the DM1.5850 level.
This followed last week's poorly received CPI figures and led to a wave of
heavy, computer generated stop-loss selling.
However, there was some comment that the reaction was overdone. Mr Nick
Parsons an economist with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said:
'Everyone is worried about the US recovery but the US has a recovery rate
that Europe would kill for.'
Dealers said volumes were low and they expected the dollar to bounce back
before being hit again and falling, according to some, as low as DM1.52. The
dollar closed at DM1.5790 down from DFM1.6070 previously.
The Yen was strong again, although held back by intervention from the Bank
of Japan. The Japanese currency was boosted by news of a Y13.2 trillion
economic stimulation package announced by the Liberal Democratic Party. The
extent of package, which still has to be ratified by the government, was
generally predicted and the Yen closed in London only marginally higher
against the dollar at Y113.35.
Meanwhile, sterling performed well in early sessions hitting DM2.4725 at
best as sentiment was buoyed by a growing feeling that the economy is on the
turn while Germany is heading for what could be its worst recession since
the Second World War.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, the chief economist at Citibank, believes the only black
spot on the horizon is the worsening trade gap and, with good fundamentals
in place, the pound is set to break through DM2.50 in the short-term and hit
DM2.65 within the next 12 months. Sterling closed at DM2.4625, up from
DM2.4500 previously.
The franc was unaffected by news of a two-per cent cut in the upper limit
emergency lending rate. The cut underlines growing economic confidence in
France but merely brings the emergency rate in line with overnight lending.
The currency strengthened to FFr3.3800 against the D-Mark from FFr3.3855.
Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta and escudo were both under pressure. The
Spanish currency was affected by the decision of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
prime minister, to call a general election five months early. It eased to
Pta72.11 against the D-Mark, down from Pta71.61.
The Bank of Portugal intervening to support the escudo which nevertheless
fell to Es93.16 against the D-Mark from Es92.97.

FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Turkish agriculture approaches
watershed - A look at a project to harness the Tigris and Euphrates for
irrigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S second largest single source irrigation scheme will be
inaugurated by Turkey's prime minister, Suleyman Demirel, on May 22, when
the large 24km Urfa tunnels are opened to take water from the Ataturk dam to
the Harran plain on the border with Syria.
The twin tunnels, providing water for 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres) of farmland
along Turkey's border with Syria and Iraq, form part of the largest
engineering undertaking in any country bordering the Mediterranean.
The South-East Anatolian development, or Gap, has already aroused criticism
from Turkey's downstream neighbours. It will be the task of the UK water
engineer, Sir William Halcrow and Partners, which has been awarded a
USDollars 12m consultancy contract, to design an irrigation system which
meets the various political, economic and environmental concerns.
Halcrow's findings could decide the future shape of farming in Turkey,
providing a blueprint for irrigation in other parts of the country.
Water management is at the heart of Turkey's attempts to harness the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers for agriculture. Turkey already earns almost Dollars
3bn from farm product exports, about 20 per cent of total export earnings.
Gap is expected to increase Turkey's irrigated farmland by a third, doubling
wheat production and increasing cotton output more than fivefold.
After going it alone for so long, Turkey is soliciting foreign advice on a
number of critical aspects of the project, an indication of desire to avoid
the criticism associated with other large scale public investment irrigation
schemes.
The French group Compagnie Nationale Bas Rhone Lanquedoc is surveying the
main canal system. Alexander Gibb, the UK consultant, has a subcontract to
look at road infrastructure. Tubitak, the Turkish science research
institute, is studying agricultural credit policy. The German company AFC is
looking at market strategy.
At Cukurova university, scientists are making studies of everything from the
reproductive habits of bees - vital for future pollination purposes in such
a vast monoculture crop scheme - to the region's soils.
Halcrow's project will focus on issues of land ownership, land quality,
topography, climate, water availability and the social, religious and
economic attitudes of farmers in the region. It will advise on the teaching
of extension skills for farmers unused to modern farm methods, on cost
recovery and conservation technologies for downstream users.
Water is perhaps the Middle East's most vital resource and control of both
the Euphrates and the Tigris would make Turkey a vital player in settlement
of the region's water disputes in any future Arab-Israeli negotiation.
Foreign hydrologists have long argued for more prudent management.
There are many obstacles. Today Turkish farmers are charged for their water
according not to volume used but to the quality of the land being irrigated
 -the poorer the soils the cheaper the water. According to Mr Hurman Ocakli,
deputy president of the Gap authority, 'the farmers use as much water as
they want. It is not even calculated.'
Repayment of loans in Turkey's south east region is 30-40 per cent, compared
with a national figure of 75-80 per cent for agricultural credits.
Many agronomists believe there will have to be widescale land reform, not so
much for equity as efficiency.
There is little prospect of increasing scale economies in a region where
according to one calculation, more than a quarter of the cultivated land is
owned by less than 1 per cent of the region's farmers. Equally striking is
that 61 per cent of farmers own less than five hectares of land.
The environmental challenge is even more urgent. No more than 30 per cent of
the planned 1.7m hectares is likely to use the more expensive drip or
pressurised hose irrigation, the rest being open furrow system.
Western officials say there is a new urgency as farmers prepare to irrigate
the first 40,000 hectares on the Harran plain, close to the Syrian border.
The land use issue is political at a time of rising violence in Kurdish
speaking areas. According to one senior official, the explicit aim of the
Gap project is to 'reduce the rural population,' through land consolidation
and the provision of alternative industry in urban areas.
Many officials believe the jobs created by the Gap will help accelerate this
process. In the long run, Ankara sees the demographic cards stacked in its
favour, and believes that this, more than any olive branch of reform, is the
best way to undermine the power base of the Kurdish guerrillas.

FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Domesday
in a big brown envelope - Cereal and beef producers wanting set-aside
payments have their paperwork cut out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE BROWN envelopes marked MAFF and weighing a total of some 20 tonnes
thudded through British farmers' letter boxes last week. Many of the cereal
and beef farmers to whom these packages were addressed will have spent much
of their Easter holiday poring over the contents. For they contained the
dramatically dubbed 'Domesday' forms, otherwise known as 'The Integrated
Administration and Control System', IACS for short.
They are the direct result of the reform last May of the Common Agricultural
Policy. If farmers do not complete them correctly those who grow cereals and
produce beef will not be eligible for arable area payments in compensation
for setting aside 15 per cent of their cereal land or for headage payments
on controlled numbers of cattle.
Each form has 19 columns of questions which farmers must answer, giving
every detail about every field under their control - its Ordnance Survey
sheet number, its national grid reference, its size (in hectares, not acres)
to two decimal places, the crop it is growing, the variety of the seed, its
estimated yield, etc etc etc. Each part field must be recorded on a separate
line which, in practice, because of split cropping perhaps, or the fact that
the whole field may not appear on just one map, means that some fields run
to five or six lines. Copies of the maps themselves must be included with
the forms when they are returned. Rather more than 20 tonnes of paper will
shortly be heading back to Maff, I suspect.
Before a farmer attempts to fill in the IACS forms he is advised to read and
fully understand the 79-page book of instructions which accompanied them.
For if there is a delay in returning the forms, or a mistake is made, the
penalties are harsh. For instance, if the forms, correct in every detail,
are returned to Maff later than the May 15 deadline the farmer concerned
will have his aid reduced by 1 per cent for each day by which the return is
delayed. If this extends beyond 20 days he will lose the whole of his
entitlement. There are similar penalties for accidental inaccuracy and
threats of criminal prosecution for those who make fraudulent claims. It is
unlikely there will be much public sympathy for an industry about to receive
close to Pounds 1bn of public money merely because its participants are
required to fill in some forms.
But to understand farmers' hostility to the massive bureaucracy it should be
remembered that most farmers did not want set-aside in the first place and
never thought that it would work; that they would far rather be growing
crops or producing meat from their land than allowing weeds to regenerate on
15 per cent of it; and that while these forms have taken hundreds of experts
10 months to write, the farmers who have to complete them have barely five
weeks to gather together all the necessary facts and evidence and return
them.
To the layman, that may sound more than adequate time. But 67 people are
leaving the land each week, leaving a growing number of farmers to do all
the work on their holdings themselves. And this at a time of year that
involves being on a tractor from dawn to dusk or perhaps on duty in the
lambing shed for 20 or more hours a day.
It would not be so bad if the related services were on the ball and helpful.
As it is I know from personal experience that the local Ordnance Survey map
office does not open until 10.30 am (weekdays only), by which time there is
invariably a queue of irate farmers banging on the door.
For next Friday is effectively the last day for placing orders for maps with
any hope of getting them in time for May 15.
In desperation many farmers are seeking assistance with the forms from land
agents, their agricultural merchants or consultants who have advertised such
a service.
On the other side, so to speak, Maff has employed 500 extra staff to check
the forms, inspect and measure fields and try to identify fraud and. Maff
also intends using aerial photographs and satellite images to double check
farmers' returns. And Pounds 25m has been allocated for policing the scheme.
Inevitably UK farmers have expressed suspicions that within the European
Comnunity they may be the victims of enthusiastic British bureaucracy, while
the farmers of other member states may be getting away with much less. This,
apparently, cannot be fully substantiated.
It is reported that some countries, notably Portugal and Spain, have used
the form as an excuse to ask extra questions on which they required answers
on matters unconnected with CAP reform. Ireland has not yet sent out its
forms and Greece produced such a complicated draft that farmers'
organisations have so far refused to agree to its distribution.
Germany issued its forms a month earlier than the UK - although farmers
spanning state borders have to complete two versions - while our nearest
neighbours across the North Sea appear to have come closest to reason.
Denmark's form runs to eight pages, Belgium's to six and Holland's to only
four.
But British farmers have some justification for feeling they are being asked
to carry a bigger bureaucratic burden than the rest. In the Community as a
whole, 34 per cent of the arable land area escapes set-aside regulations and
therefore these forms, because of small farm exemptions. Moreover in Greece
88 per cent of the arable land is not involved; in Luxembourg the figure is
77 per cent and in Italy 71 per cent. Other Mediterranean member states and
those with poor farming structure qualify for rather lower exemptions while
even Holland has 36 per cent of its area outside the scheme; Germany 27 per
cent and France 18 per cent.
In the UK, however, small farm exemptions represent only 4 per cent of the
arable area. That is the reason why almost any farmer you may have seen over
Easter will have been even more grumpy than usual.

FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG plans 50% stake in Lihir
gold project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea (PNG) yesterday said it would take a half
share in the USDollars 760m Lihir Island gold project unless RTZ Corporation
and Niugini Mining, the joint venture partners, find a third partner within
a month.
The announcement comes only days after the government said it would increase
its proposed stake in Lihir from 20 per cent to 30 per cent to achieve
parity with the Australian-run Porgera gold project.
Mr Paias Wingti, prime minister, said after a cabinet meeting in Port
Moresby that the government had decided to take a 50 per cent shareholding
to make sure the project was not delayed.
He said the joint venture partners had indicated the project faced
'financing difficulties."
The announcement appeared to surprise the joint venture partners. Niugini
Mining, which owns 20 per cent of the project, said it had received no
official notification of the proposal.
The Lihir Joint Venture (LJV), which represents both companies, said it was
considering its response and hoped 'to continue discussions with the PNG
government in the near future."
The government was expected to pay USDollars 37.5m, equivalent to 30 per
cent of the project's sunk costs, for a 30 per cent stake which would reduce
Niugini's shareholding from 20 per cent to 14 per cent, and RTZ's from 80
per cent to 56 per cent.
Lac Minerals of Canada, one of the companies RTZ talked to about taking a
shareholding, withdrew from the project last year, and the development has
been delayed by RTZ's failure to find a fresh taker for a 15 per cent stake.

FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox halts trade in raw sugar as
volumes plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN London's raw sugar contract was suspended yesterday by the London
Futures and Options Exchange (Fox). But the search is on for a replacement
contract, which it is thought could be launched this summer.
Mr Robin Woodhead. Fox chief executive, said a report by Landell Mills
Commodities Studies had suggested that no single factor had been behind the
sharp decline in the exchange's raw sugar volumes. But moves from sterling
to dollars, from floor to screen and back again, and the addition of Cuba as
a country of deliverable origin had all done harm. Business switched to the
relatively young and very liquid New York market.
Last month London raw sugar volume fell to 1,399 lots compared with 4,384
lots in March last year. In January 1991, when trading was switched to
screens in a bid to boost volumes, the contract traded 120,176 lots.
Sugar trading, which began in London in the late 1880s, will go on in the
screen-based white contract - probably the world's most successful
screen-traded commodity. But Mr Woodhead reported a groundswell of support
from trade and brokerage houses for the exchange to create a new raws
contract.
Response from the trade in London and New York yesterday was mixed. 'It is
essentially the main sugar trade in London who dropped the contract in the
first place. Why do they now say they want it continued?' asked one seasoned
observer. Changing any contract was always a sure way to lose volume, he
said, pointing out that London's virtually untouched cocoa contract was
Fox's most successful market.
However, another London trader said reports of the death of raw sugar
trading in London were greatly exaggerated. He suggested that a new contract
 -possibly screen based - would attract arbitrage business with New York.
Several US traders pointed out that their companies had stopped using London
when it decided to accept Cuban sugar for delivery, as dealing in Cuban
sugar was against US law. They would welcome a revived London market,
especially in the light of recent renewed interest in sugar.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TWO-WEEK long action by Danish fishermen ended yesterday when the two
largest fishing associations agreed to a government rescue package for the
industry, which has been hit by cheap imported fish and cuts in EC catch
quotas.
Exports of fish and fisheries products in 1992 were about Dkr13bn.
Fishermen mounted blockades of ports, fish processing factories and trucks
transporting foreign fish through Denmark, the action culminating in a
freeze on all fishing by Danish fishing vessels.
The demands met in the agreement include an increase in fish quotas, in
particular cod and sole, cheaper long term loans, improved taxation rules,
pension payments for retiring fishermen and better compensation for scrapped
vesssels, which are part of measures to cut the size of the fishing fleet.

ZINC closed near seven-week highs on the LME, largely reflecting technical
factors. The early breach of chart resistance around Dollars 1,030 a tonne
for three-month metal triggered fund short covering and further buying. Talk
also circulated of production cuts, centred on Pacific Rim countries,
although no news had emerged by the close. Three-month COPPER was firmer, as
the market staged a recovery from last week's five-year lows and moved above
Dollars 2,050 a tonne. But business was not particularly active, while
volatility levels in traded options eased, reflecting calmer conditions.
Trading on the London bullion market was thin after the holiday weekend,
with few new fundamental factors to sustain prices. Chartists said both GOLD
and SILVER were consolidating above recent lows but forecast renewed
weakness near term. Early firmness in Europe was attributed to the overnight
rise in the Nikkei index and the unrest in South Africa after the weekend
slaying of Communist Party leader Chris Hani. But these factors were played
down later as New York opened mixed.

FT  14 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Hopes of lower interest rates lift
European paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
HOPES of lower interest rates lifted the main European government bond
markets yesterday, with the recent strong performance of the US Treasury
bond market providing an additional boost.
The Bank of France lowered one of its key interest rates yesterday morning,
and dealers said many participants in the bond markets expect to see a
further easing by the Bundesbank at this week's repo.
French government bonds closed higher on hopes that money market rates would
continue to decline in the near future, following the decision by the Bank
of France to cut its ceiling rate - the five to 10-day rate - from 12 per
cent to 10 per cent. The central bank held its intervention rate at 9.10 per
cent.
The cut in the ceiling rate had been widely expected, but the French bond
market took further encouragement from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, who said he expected French interest rates to continue to fall
over the next few days.
The June futures contract ended up 0.32 at 118.22 after a high of 118.36,
while the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.09 per cent against
7.14 per cent.
AFTER posting early gains on news of unexpectedly weak retail sales, US
Treasury prices lost ground following a disappointing seven-year note
auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 104
3/8 , well below its highs for the day, and yielding 6.778 per cent. At the
short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/16 at
100 5/32 , to yield 3.774 per cent.
Prices gained ground in early trading after the Commerce department
announced that retail sales fell 1.0 per cent in March, and declined 1.2 per
cent if car sales were excluded. The market had been expecting March sales
to be flat, and the data was initially viewed as evidence that economic
activity may be slowing down. Analysts pointed out, however, that the severe
storms in March may have been behind the drop in sales.
The market dropped back from its morning highs, however, after the auction
of Dollars 9.75bn of seven-year notes met with poor demand. The ratio of
bids tendered to bids accepted was unusually low at 1.93-to-1.
GERMAN government bond prices gained about a quarter of a point on hopes
that the Bundesbank would lower its repo rate from last week's 8.13 per cent
to perhaps between 8.05 to 8.10 per cent at this week's repo.
Dealers pointed out that the move by the Bank of France - coupled with the
pressure on the Spanish currency - could encourage the Bundesbank to lower
German interest rates.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 96.40 and hit a high of 96.57
before trading at 96.48 by late afternoon.
SPANISH government bond prices, which had fallen back very sharply on Monday
in the domestic market on political uncertainty, regained some of their
losses yesterday but still ended the session down from their pre-Easter
levels.
Monday's sharp fall was triggered by the prime minister's decision to call
an early general election - on June 6 - leading to worries that the peseta
may come under pressure and then be devalued.
'The early election heightens the uncertainty and the devaluation risk has
been increased,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais.
Yesterday, the peseta came under pressure in the foreign exchange markets,
and dealers said they suspected the Bank of Spain had intervened in order to
support the Spanish currency.
Traders noted that there had been heavy selling on Monday by domestic
investors, many of whom appeared to expect a wave of foreign selling.
However, dealers pointed out that selling by foreigners was not
'particularly heavy' yesterday.
A STRONGER lira and the firm tone in the European government bond markets
gave Italian government bond prices a boost yesterday.
On Liffe, the June BTP contact rose 80 basis points to 95.38. The lira rose
to around 964 against the D-Mark from 978 on Friday.
UK government bond prices gained between  1/8 and  1/2 a point, taking their
cue from the recent firmness of the US bond market, sterling strength, and
hopes of lower interest rates across Europe.
JAPANESE government bonds fell back yesterday, responding to the strong
stock market rally. The Nikkei stock index ended 858.15 points higher at
20,740.29 as share prices were boosted by news of the government's Y13,200bn
fiscal stimulus package.
The bond market opened on a firm note helped by the strength of the yen,
which moved to Y112.70 to the dollar before falling back. Bond prices
remained relatively stable during the day but fell back towards the end of
trading.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling sector braced as Japanese
units set to raise Pounds 600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STERLING market braced itself yesterday for a further spate of activity,
amid expectations that two Japanese power companies are preparing to raise
about Pounds 600m in sterling Eurobonds today.
Swap spreads in the sterling market have widened further in recent days,
creating fresh arbitrage opportunities for borrowers.
Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the largest of the Japanese power
companies, has mandated Credit Suisse First Boston to arrange a Pounds 300m
five-year issue, which CSFB plans to launch today. The proceeds are expected
to be swapped into yen via floating-rate sterling.
With five-year swap spreads at about 50 basis points above Libor, the
borrower is expected to achieve a funding level of around 15 basis points
below the London interbank offered rate (Libor), assuming a launch spread of
about 35 basis points over the five-year gilt yield.
Kansai Electric Power is also believed to be preparing a Pounds 300
five-year deal via SG Warburg, but the timing of this deal is more
uncertain. Officials at SG Warburg declined to comment.
After record volume in the first quarter, the sterling sector is suffering
from some overhang of paper, despite strong demand. In particular, there has
been a surplus of five-year paper.
However, further issues are expected to be concentrated at this area of the
yield curve, because swap opportunities are most attractive over a five-year
term.
Seven-year swap spreads are around 35 basis points and 10-year swap spreads
are currently about 25 basis points, compared with five-year swap spreads of
50 basis points.
Yesterday, Deutsche Bank Finance added a further Pounds 100m tranche to its
outstanding Pounds 200m issue launched in February. The bonds were priced to
yield 37 basis points over the five-year gilt yield, a pick up over the
current spread of 32 basis points for the outstanding paper.
In the French franc market, Alcatel added a further FF1bn to its FF2bn
five-year deal launched earlier this month via Societe Generale. Firm demand
was encouraged by expectations of further cuts in French interest rates.
In the Canadian dollar market, Toyota Credit Canada and the City of Winnipeg
both tapped the market, with deals aimed at continental retail investors.
The City of Winnipeg launched a CDollars 125m 10-year issue of 8 1/2 per
cent bonds via Wood Gundy. The deal was priced to yield 93 basis points over
the comparable Canadian government bond.
Toyota's CDollars 150m issue of five-year bonds, via Hambros Bank, was
priced to yield 48 basis points over the curve.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's rating for Chinese
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first Chinese bond issue planned for the Euromarket by an entity not
owned by the state, a Dollars 150m floating-rate note offer from Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corporation, was yesterday given a Baa1
credit rating by Moody's, the US agency, writes Richard Waters.
The corporation is owned by the provincial government of Guangdong, China's
fastest-growing region, and has been given the same rating as that accorded
the People's Republic.
The province's economy grew by 14 per cent in real terms in 1992, and its
exports by 32 per cent, Moody's said. Foreign debt, it added, 'represents a
relatively small burden against quickly rising external revenues'.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bankers warn over Brazil
'Brady bonds'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S bank creditors will have to change their choice of so-called 'Brady
bonds' to be issued by the country if they are to reach final agreement on a
debt reduction deal, bankers claimed yesterday.
It emerged earlier this week that bank creditors have asked for 60 per cent
of their loans to be converted into fixed-rate 'par bonds', with only 18 per
cent in the form of floating-rate 'discount bonds'.
Brazil has indicated that it wants each class of bond to comprise around 40
per cent of the final deal, with other types of debt making up the rest.
The banks' preference for par bonds puts Brazil in the same position as
Argentina last year, which also had to persuade banks to accept fewer
fixed-rate bonds than they had requested. After tense negotiations, the
Argentine Brady-style debt reduction deal was finally completed on April 7.
The preference for par bonds has been prompted by the continuing rise in the
US Treasuries market. The 30-year bonds, which are repaid over an extended
period, carry a fixed coupon of 4 per cent in the first year, rising to 6
per cent after the sixth year, with the principal fully collateralised by US
zero-coupon bonds.
Discount bonds, by comparison, pay a floating rate, and carry a 35 per cent
reduction from face value. The discount, and the better collateral on the
par bonds, explains the banks' choice so far, according to one banker in
London.
Analysts of the secondary market for lesser developed country debt said that
banks would have to accept a higher proportion of discount bond for the deal
to go ahead. Mr Arthur Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, said: 'We and the
banking committee have submitted what we would like to do, but an agreement
has to be based on what is possible to do.'

FT  14 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England sets date for
Ecu500m notes tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has set its Ecu500m tender of three-year notes for April
20, providing some vital liquidity to a market which has been starved of
paper in recent months, writes Tracy Corrigan.
It is the second T-note tender by the Bank of England, following its
Ecu1.2bn tender in February, since the collapse of the Ecu market forced the
T-note programme to be put on hold last autumn.
But prospects for further supply in the Ecu market remain rather grim. Only
the UK and France among European sovereign borrowers are showing substantial
commitment to the market through regular programmes.
But France has already raised 45 per cent of this year's Ecu financing
(which accounts for 15 per cent of its total funding), and the only other
European sovereign borrower to tap the market so far this year was Finland,
with an opportunistic Ecu500m deal in February. Otherwise, the market has
had to rely on agency funding.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Westpac sells large part of US
loan portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, yesterday announced the
sale of a large part of its US loan portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank of
Canada in a further step towards its planned withdrawal from large-scale
international operations.
Westpac said Toronto-Dominion would assume up to USDollars 5.5bn in credit
commitments, representing approximately USDollars 3bn of risk-adjusted loans
to more than 100 US corporations.
The sale, which is at book value, follows Westpac's decision to reduce its
corporate lending risk assets by ADollars 10bn (USDollars 7bn) over the next
three years as part of a restructuring plan under which it will refocus on
Australian business.
Mr Robert Joss, managing director, said the sale of the loans was 'tangible
evidence' that Westpac was achieving the goals set out in its recovery
programme.
Mr Joss said the deal would enable Westpac's Americas division to focus on
corporate customers doing business in Australia and New Zealand, where
Westpac is the second-biggest trading bank. Westpac has already scaled back
its North American operations.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Riady family returns to its
ancestral lands - Growth is taking the Lippo group back to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most striking phenomena of Asian business in the past decade has
been the appearance on Hong Kong's corporate scene of expatriate Chinese
businessmen from the rest of south-east Asia.
Hong Kong has become the staging point for these 'overseas Chinese' who want
to spread their asset bases wider than their adopted countries. This
includes investment in China, land of their ancestors.
There is no better example of this than the Lippo group of Indonesia.
Controlled by the Riady family through a series of private trusts, it spans
banking in Indonesia; banking, travel and property development in Hong Kong;
large-scale infrastructure and hotel development in China; and banking,
property and diversified investment in the US.
In Indonesia, it controls seven listed companies, while in Hong Kong it
controls six listed companies through its flagship Lippo Limited. The group
has no holding company - a plan to consolidate group assets has been
postponed indefinitely - but contains many private subsidiaries linked to
its listed companies.
Lippo executives in Jakarta say the group is capitalised at USDollars 2.5bn
 -split equally between Indonesia and the rest. Group banking assets total
USDollars 3.2bn, divided between Indonesia with 70 per cent and other
countries with 30 per cent. Non-banking assets total USDollars 1.5bn.
But the lack of a formal corporate structure concerns some brokers, who want
to know more about the flows within the group. 'I can't guarantee that, by
buying into a traded Lippo company, I will share in the group's success,'
says one Jakarta-based analyst. 'The family may be keeping the most
lucrative investments in private hands.'
As with many Chinese companies, Lippo is dominated by one family. In
Indonesia, they are known by their surname Riady; in Hong Kong and Fujian,
their home province in China, they are known as the Li family. Mr Mochtar
Riady, the family's scion, is in overall control and concentrates on the
family's considerable Indonesian investments. His sons - James, 36, and
Stephen, 32 - run operations in the US and Hong Kong respectively.
Networking, a key characteristic of Chinese business practice, has rewarded
the family. Mr Mochtar Riady, his wife and two sons, where invited by Mr
Bill Clinton, US president, to attend his inauguration in January. The
connection with the Clintons goes back to the early 1980s when the Riadys
bought into Worthen Bank of Little Rock, Arkansas. They sold it in 1985.
Their Asian contacts are less high-profile but still powerful. In Hong Kong,
the Riadys are allied to Mr Li Ka-Shing, one of the colony's richest men,
and China Resources, a leading Beijing company there. Mr Li owns 10 per cent
of Lippo Limited and China Resources 5 per cent.
The Singapore-Malaysian Hong Leong group is an important partner, as is C.
Itoh, the big Japanese trading house. Both own stakes in Lippo
International, a private investment company, which also owns 8.2 per cent of
Lippo Limited. Lippo International's best deal to date was the purchase in
1990 of Lippo Sun Plaza in Kowloon for HKDollars 900m (USDollars 116m) and
its sale, a year later, for HKDollars 2bn.
The family's connections in Indonesia are also impressive. Mr Mochtar Riady
is a former executive of Bank Central Asia (BCA), Indonesia's largest
private bank and a subsidiary of the Salim Group led by Mr Liem Sioe Liong,
reputedly the country's richest man. Bankers say Mr Riady was largely
responsible for the growth of BCA in the 1970s and the early 1980s; Mr Liong
was involved in the initial financing of some Lippo group activities.
In Indonesia and Hong Kong, Lippo has grown rapidly. When Lippo Bank in
Indonesia was listed in 1988, it had 28 branches. Today it has about 200.
Total assets rose to Rp3,818bn (Dollars 1,84bn) last year, from Rp2.684nn in
1990. But the rate of growth has made some analysts wary. They estimate
branch managers' average experience at only four years and say the bank may
be poorly positioned to cope with sector-wide problems of non-performing
loans.
The group is also a large property developer in Indonesia. It is
lead-financing two large property developments in Jakarta - Lippo City and
Lippo Village - with a planned investment of USDollars 1.5bn over the next
five years.
In Hong Kong, the first big acquisition for the family was the purchase in
November 1984 of Hong Kong Chinese Bank (HKCB) from Overseas Trust Bank for
HKDollars 337m. Worthen Bank was the vehicle for the transaction, with the
Riadys, Mr Jack Stephens, a wealthy US financier, and Mr Liong putting up
the cash.
From that beginning, the family's assets in Hong Kong have grown to exceed
USDollars 1bn. HKCB was refloated on the colony's stock exchange last year,
raising more than HKDollars 700m for the Riadys; the family controls the
bank through a 60 per cent stake held by Lippo Limited. Lippo also controls
EIE and Asia Securities, both property investment companies, Morning Star, a
travel agency, Hong Kong Building and Loan Agency, a company providing home
finance, and Lippo Asia, a merchant bank.
Despite the property and travel assets, the quality of which is variable,
the group's focus is banking-related services, with a strong orientation
towards China. Mr Stephen Riady, the family member who heads Lippo in Hong
Kong, goes as far as to describe the group as a provider of merchant banking
services.
This is especially the case with Lippo's development plans in Fujian
province, on China's south coast. Mr Mochtar Riady's grandfather immigrated
to Indonesia from Putian, a Fujian town.
Lippo in Hong Kong is planning developments in Fujian, including a 2,400MW
power station, hotels, commercial property, and port and airport
construction. In most, it will act as arranger of finance and technical
expertise, while taking between a 10 per cent to 20 per cent interest in the
assets.
'The power station is a project we like very much,' says Mr Stephen Riady.
'Infrastructure is a good business to be in. There are not many people
involved, so competition is limited, and the buyer is the government, not
the public. Fujian Electric guarantees us a minimum take-up and guarantees
us a minimum yield. We will take 20 to 30 per cent of the power station.'
The port, at Meizhou Bay - one of five coastal ports the Chinese government
has selected for development - will be upgraded to take a coal loader for
the power station. If direct links with Taiwan come, as many expect, Lippo
plans to upgrade it for containerisation.
The group also has monopoly rights to develop Meizhou island, which houses a
deity of significance to fishermen and Fujianese. Visitors from Taiwan to
the island's shrine totalled about 500,000 last year.
Lippo plans three hotels, a golf course, and residential and commercial
developments on the island. Says Mr Riady: 'We do the master plan and find
investors, that's our strength.'

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Toyota plans office efficiency
programme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest vehicle manufacturer, is seeking to raise the
efficiency of its office staff by 30 per cent. The company is to set up a
committee to consider how to restructure operations to do so.
Toyota expects to achieve efficiency improvements of 10 per cent by reducing
working hours and by a further 20 per cent by devoting office workers' time
to new businesses.
The move comes as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (JAMA) is
considering applying to the ministry of labour to be designated an industry
eligible for employment subsidies. The funds would be used to transfer
employees to subsidiaries and re-train employees for new jobs.
One condition for eligibility is that production should fall in three
consecutive months by 5 per cent year-on-year. In December, motor industry
production was down by 9.7 per cent, in January by 13.5 per cent and in
February by 10.2 per cent. However, new car sales in Japan rose in March for
the first time in 14 months. But sales cannot be directly linked to
production, JAMA said.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, has lowered its
forecast net profits for the year to the end of March due to heavy losses at
its US subsidiary, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The company said non-consolidated after-tax profits for the 12 months would
plunge 78.3 per cent to Y1.3bn (Dollars 11m), instead of the initial
forecast of Y6.5bn announced in November.
Fujisawa expects an extraordinary loss of Y6.5bn, due to appraisal losses on
its stake in Fujisawa USA, which suffered net losses of Dollars 72m in the
year to December 1992.
But, owing to brisk domestic sales, the company upgraded non-consolidated
sales and pre-tax earnings projections.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Unions in move to block Black's
Fairfax ambition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S media unions yesterday sought an urgent meeting with Mr John
Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister) in a bid to block Mr
Conrad Black's attempt to increase his stake in the John Fairfax newspaper
group.
The request is likely to reinvigorate opposition to Mr Black, the Canadian
proprietor of the Telegraph newspaper group of the UK, who is seeking to
increase his stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.
In an unusual move, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and the
Printing and Kindred Industries Union sent a joint statement to Mr Dawkins
urging him to withhold approval for Mr Black's request.
'We are writing to express our extreme concern that the federal government
is likely to approve the application by interests associated with Conrad
Black to increase their holding,' the unions said.
'As representatives of people working in the newspaper industry, we do not
believe that the national interest would be served by allowing the Black
interests to increase their holding.'
Government officials have signalled recently that Mr Dawkins was likely to
approve Mr Black's application, which is required under foreign investment
regulations on media investments.
Opposition from backbench government MPs has softened in recent weeks,
partly because a number of prominent critics of Mr Black were promoted to
ministerial positions in a government reshuffle.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the (Melbourne) Age and
the Australian Financial Review, was sold to a consortium led by the
Telegraph in 1991.
Mr Kerry Packer, the billionaire Australian publisher, revealed last week
that he held a stake of more than 10 per cent in Fairfax, prompting
speculation that he would launch a takeover bid shortly.
Under Australia's cross-media ownership laws, Mr Packer would have to reduce
his 48 per cent stake in the Channel Nine television network to less than 15
per cent before acquiring more than 14.99 per cent of Fairfax.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Dust settles after turmoil at
Placer Dome - The mining group's new chief will focus on gold and copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCARS are only just beginning to heal at Placer Dome, Canada's biggest gold
mining group, after a boardroom battle that kept the Canadian financial
community enthralled for months.
It resulted in the departure of several long-serving directors - including
Mr Tony Petrina, formerly the president and chief executive, and Mr Peter
Crossgrove, a vice-chairman who for some time seemed likely to succeed him.
There is also an injection of new blood. After a worldwide search, Mr John
Willson has been recruited from a smaller gold company, Pegasus, to be chief
executive.
The turmoil at Placer started in February last year when the group announced
write-downs totalling CDollars 328m (USDollars 260.7m) after tax - including
the entire CDollars 266m investment in the Mount Milligan copper-gold
venture in British Columbia, acquired in 1990. This seems to have been a
catalyst which brought simmering personal conflicts to the boil.
Analysts had warned of trouble ahead when Placer was formed in 1987 by a
three-way merger between Placer Development, Dome Mines and Campbell Red
Lake Mines.
The merger was welcomed as bringing together some of the best gold mining
properties in North America and the South Pacific. Nevertheless, some
wondered why Placer, a fast-growing, Vancouver-based group with mines in
Australia and Papua New Guinea, would want to join with two rather
conservatively-managed Toronto companies.
Placer, it seemed, believed it was a takeover target. Among those mentioned
as potential aggressors was Mr Bob Needham, who once headed Placer's
Australian operations and is today advising the government of Papua New
Guinea on minerals policies. Mr Needham and New Zealand entrepreneur Mr
Bruce Judge were thought to be stalking Placer.
The friendly Canadian merger went ahead, but London brokers in particular
raised doubts about the wisdom of running three such different companies
simultaneously from Toronto and Vancouver.
Nevertheless, the new Placer group seemed to be coping even though, as Mr
Crossgrove said recently, 'it remained an unsettled mix of two diverse
corporate cultures'.
Then came the Mount Milligan writedowns, coupled with the news that CDollars
50m of the CDollars 106m carrying value of Placer's investment in the Eskay
Creek gold project in British Columbia, another interest acquired in 1990,
would be written down.
Placer said a mine at Mount Milligan would produce a positive return but not
enough to justify the CDollars 500m to CDollars 600m required to develop it.
At the Placer annual meeting, Mr Petrina told shareholders: 'Let me be
blunt. We should have taken more time to develop more information on which
to make the decision (about Mount Milligan). We relied too heavily on
analysis that did not go far enough. It must not happen again.'
The Placer board obviously felt the same way. Last May, Mr Crossgrove, 55, a
board member and president of Itco Properties, was appointed to a new
position of vice-chairman and sent from Toronto to Vancouver, where Mr
Petrina had his base, to head the company's mergers and acquisition
activities. Placer said he would 'complement the strengths of the president,
Tony Petrina'.
Instead, according to insiders, it led to a row about executive
responsibility because Mr Crossgrove was to report directly to the board,
not to Mr Petrina. This led to the resignation of Mr Petrina, seen by the
investment community as a skilled mine operator, who had been 32 years with
Placer and its predecessor. He announced on June 14 that he would step down
in September, but would stay on the board.
Mr Crossgrove stepped in as acting chief executive and quickly gained a
reputation as the man most likely to repair the group's reputation. He
seemed to be a front-runner to succeed Mr Petrina, or perhaps take over when
the chairman, Mr Fraser Fell, 64, retired.
Mr Crossgrove was soon claiming there had been a change of culture at the
company, a change that emphasised teamwork and shareholder value. He said he
had redefined Placer's growth strategy and ended the private fiefdoms within
the group that caused managers to work at cross-purposes. Growing in
confidence, he criticised Mr Petrina's management style during a newspaper
interview in a way that upset many other members of the Placer board.
'This left him at odds with so many people it was obvious it would be best
for him to leave,' one insider recalls.
So Placer turned to Mr Willson, a British-born, 52-year-old mining engineer,
who in three years as president of Pegasus was credited with turning the
low-cost gold producer into a stock market high-flyer.
He took over at Placer in January as chief executive of a group with
interests in 17 gold mines in five countries, USDollars 500m of cash in the
bank, virtually no debt, and a market value of more than USDollars 2bn.
Placer last year produced a record 2.3m troy ounces of gold and generated
net profit of USDollars 111m on revenues of Dollars 1.1bn. It reported that
production costs had been cut by 17 per cent to Dollars 186 an ounce, making
it one of the lowest-cost producers among the big gold groups. In spite of
the increase in gold output, Placer's reserves rose from 16.8m to 18.4m
ounces.
The group also has a new non-executive chairman based in Toronto: Mr Robert
Franklin, 46, president of Signalta Capital Corporation and a director of
Placer and, previously, Campbell Red Lake.
Analysts suggest the Placer board has been envious of the high market rating
given by investors to its rival Canadian gold group, American Barrick
Resources, and will want Mr Willson to ensure the share price is maximised.
This calls into question Placer's recent strategic move into base metals
mining. How far should diversification go?
The most important step so far has been its purchase of half the Zaldivar
copper deposit in Chile for Dollars 100m (Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish
group, owns the rest). Placer will spend about Dollars 400m over four years
to develop the project, which is expected to have a life of 50 years. It is
scheduled to produce about 200m lbs of copper annually at a cost of less
than 50 cents a lb.
Mr Willson says Placer is engaged in a 'pragmatic, intelligent, internal
debate' to determine the group's approach to copper investment. 'With gold
prices drifting down we must be in a position to show good earnings from
elsewhere. Copper and gold is fine. But spread the company's interests too
widely and you are in danger of losing the high value the market puts on
gold companies. If you want to be the best you must focus, concentrate, and
devote most of your energies to your focus.'
And what of the Mount Milligan project that proved such a catalyst for
change at Placer? Mr Willson says: 'The solution to Mount Milligan is higher
copper and gold prices. It is getting low priority but we are still working
on it.'

HARBOUR Centre Development, the hotel investment arm of Hong Kong's Wharf
(Holdings) group, has bought the City Place hotel and office tower in
Chicago from the First National Bank of Chicago for USDollars 54m (Dollars
HK419m).
The deal is Harbour Centre's third US hotel investment since December 1991.
It has also acquired the Inn on the Park in Houston and the Marriott Hotel
in Dallas for a total of Dollars HK668m.
Mr Edward Cheng, Harbour Centre managing director, said: 'It is our strategy
to acquire key hotels in strategic cities in a depressed market with a view
to longer-term asset appreciation.'
The company is estimated to have more than HKDollars 250m in net cash,
following a rights issue last year, and will fund the acquisition from
internal resources. Mr Cheng said the group was interested in further hotel
purchases.
City Place is managed by Hyatt, but the purchase is conditional on the
termination of this contract. The management will then be taken over by
Wharf's own Omni hotel management chain.
The Wharf group has taken a gamble on the of the US hotel market since the
1988 purchase of the Omni chain from Aer Lingus for USDollars 135m. The
market has been depressed and Omni's US network of 40 hotels lost money last
year.

GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in
first-quarter profits to Dollars 1.16bn after tax, helped by strong earnings
advances in most divisions other than aircraft engines and technical
products and services.
The improvement translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.36, up by 11
per cent on Dollars 1.23 reported for the first-quarter of 1992. If the
discontinued aerospace operations are excluded from the comparisons,
after-tax profits from continuing businesses would have risen by 13 per
cent, to Dollars 1.08bn.
First-quarter revenues from the continuing interests increased by 3 per
cent, to Dollars 12.9bn, year-on-year.
Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, said that the earnings growth was 'broad-based
as double-digit increases were reported by GE Capital Services,
transportation systems, motors, NBC, power systems, appliances and
plastics'. The lower profits in the aircraft engines division, which
produces Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, 'reflected an increase in product
development costs and restructuring costs necessary to meet market
conditions', he said.

UNION Carbide, the large US chemicals group, announced yesterday that it was
selling its OrganoSilicon subsidiary, which makes fluids and chemicals used
in a wide range of industries, to a limited partnership run by Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenerette (DLJ).
The sale is valued at about Dollars 300m.
The consideration comprises Dollars 220m in cash, plus Dollars 80m of
preferred stock - which is convertible into a 30 per cent voting interest in
the silicones company.
Union Carbide, which will realise an unspecified after-tax gain on the deal,
said that the transaction effectively concluded the asset sale programme
which it announced in December 1991.
OSi had sales last year of around Dollars 350m, and has facilities in
Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Korea and Switzerland, as well as in the US.
The company employs around 1,100 people.
DLJ, a New York investment banking operation, is part of the large Equitable
insurance group, and the DLJ Merchant Banking Partners - which is making the
acquisition - represents a Dollars 1bn acquisition fund.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: FASB rule impacts on bondholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Financial Accounting Standards Board, the US accountancy standards
group, voted yesterday to approve a rule that will force US financial
institutions to carry more of their debt and equity securities at market
value.
The ruling, which will come into effect next year, will have a particularly
big effect on banks and insurance companies, which have large holdings of
bonds. The changes will make it harder for them to categorise their debt
securities as long-term investments held for the duration of their maturity,
and thus valuable at cost.
Instead, banks and insurers will have to categorise more of these bonds as
'available for sale', which means they will be marked-to-market, or valued
according to their current price in the market.
The FASB decision immediately came under fire from banking and insurance
groups, which have long argued that current value accounting would introduce
unwelcome volatility into their earnings.
They have also argued that having to mark-to-market more of their financial
assets may force them to change their investment philosophies by switching
more of their assets out of long-term securities and into short-term
securities.
The American Bankers Association, which expressed disappointment yesterday
at the FASB vote, called current value accounting 'a bad idea whose time
should not have come'. The ABA said the new rule would 'change the way banks
conduct their business and the fundamental role they play in the economy'.
The FASB was also attacked for changing its rules on the accounting of
assets, but not on the accounting of liabilities. In a statement, the
Metropolitan Life insurance group said: 'Marking only assets to market
without marking the corresponding liabilities to market is not sound
accounting and reporting practice. We believe it makes little sense and is
not healthy for long-term lenders and borrowers in the capital markets.'
A spokeswoman for the FASB said the board voted by 5-2 to approve the rule
after one of its seven members, who had previously held out against
supporting current value accounting, changed his mind.
The rule will be formally issued in June.

CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday posted a
strong improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, helped by a better
business climate and the television network's ability to command higher
advertising rates as it gains market share.
Net income was Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars 3.50, compared with a net loss of
Dollars 64m, or Dollars 4.18, a year ago.
Earnings benefited from a pre-tax gain of Dollars 19.2m on the sale of some
marketable securities. Sales fell 19 per cent to Dollars 878.9m from Dollars
1.08bn.
A year ago, CBS took a non-cash post-tax charge of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars
5.32, for the adoption of new accounting standards.
On Wall Street, shares in CBS closed up Dollars 7 1/8 at a 52-week high of
Dollars 237 1/8 . The New York Times Company, which owns 31 regional
newspapers and a 50 per cent stake in the International Herald Tribune,
yesterday posted net income of Dollars 10.9m, or 14 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 454.5m for the 1993 first quarter. A year earlier, the
company suffered a net loss of Dollars 20m, or 26 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 435.9m.
The results were distorted by a charge of Dollars 33.4m, or 43 cents, for
accounting changes.

<TEXT>
COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks group, yesterday unveiled a 21 per
cent improvement in earnings per share during the first quarter of 1993, and
an 18 per cent advance in profits, before accounting-related charges, to
Dollars 454m after tax.
Earnings per share advanced to 35 cents, compared with 29 cents.
Sales in the three-month period were also up by around 10 per cent, at
Dollars 3.05bn.
Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman, suggested the first-quarter results 'support
our very bullish outlook for continued strong performance in the remainder
of the year'.
Coca-Cola shares - which, like others in the consumer products sector, have
been hit by fears of brand erosion in response to the recent Philip
Morris/Marlboro announcement of price cuts - slipped by Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 39 1/8 at the close.
The company said worldwide gallon shipments of soft drinks, concentrates and
syrups increased by 6 per cent in the first quarter. International
concentrate shipments were up by 7 per cent, while US shipments rose by 3
per cent.
Meanwhile, unit case volume rose by 4 per cent, with international volume up
by 5 per cent and US volume up by 3 per cent.
At the operating level, the volume increases, coupled with margin
improvement, led to an 18 per cent advance in profits, to Dollars 677m.
The earnings-per-share advances also reflected a share repurchasing
programme: Coca-Cola bought in 2.5m shares in the first quarter, and has
bought in another 1m in the first eight days of the second quarter.
The company aims to acquire up to 100m shares between now and 2000.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Boise Cascade reduces losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOISE Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company,
yesterday reported a reduced Dollars 12.1m loss in the first three months of
1993.
By comparison, in the first quarter of 1992, Boise suffered a loss of
Dollars 43.3m before the cumulative effect of accounting-related changes.
Sales were slightly higher at Dollars 984m, compared with Dollars 953.9m in
the same period of last year.
The company said that the profits figure reflected continued weakness in the
paper business, which was partially offset by a strong performance in the
office and building products divisions.
In the paper division, Boise said losses were below those of the first
quarter of 1992 but higher than the deficit recorded in the final quarter
last year.
Prices of the company's mix of pulp and paper grades continued to decline on
average in the latest three-month period, and reached the lowest level seen
in the current industry cycle.
In the office products area, sales volume was flat year-on-year, but
profitability improved due to reduced costs.
Profits from the building products division also climbed sharply, due to an
improvement in demand and a shrinking supply of harvestable timber in the
Pacific north-west, which drove lumber and hardwood prices higher.
On Wall Street, Boise shares were Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 25 1/2 at
the close.
International Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday reported
first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 64m, or 52 cents a share, on sales of
Dollars 3.4bn, writes Karen Zagor.
A year earlier, the company's earnings were muddied by a number of charges
which reduced net income to Dollars 52m, or 44 cents.
Stripping out the impact of an accounting change and the costs to retire
high interest debt, International Paper earned Dollars 104m, or 87 cents in
the first three months of 1992 on sales of Dollars 3.4bn.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco modifies share scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the large food and cigarettes manufacturer, said yesterday that
it would go ahead with its 'targeted stock' scheme - which would create two
classes of shares, one pegged to the fortunes of its tobacco division and
one to the performance of its food operations - in spite of the cigarette
price war begun by Philip Morris, a rival manufacturer, earlier this month.
RJR Nabisco's scheme would be modified in two important respects. First, the
group would simply proceed with the sale of 93m RN-Nabisco shares to new
investors. These shares would be pegged to the food operations' performance
and represented a 25 per cent interest in the food group's equity.
RJR Nabisco would not issue RN-Nabisco shares to existing investors in the
company at this stage. Instead, the existing RJR Nabisco shares would be
renamed as RN-Reynolds shares once the RN-Nabisco flotation had gone ahead,
and Reynolds group would retain the remaining 75 per cent interest in the
food group's equity.
This contrasts with the original targeted stock scheme, which envisaged that
another 142m RN-Nabisco shares would be issued to existing RJR Nabisco
shareholders about six months after the flotation of RN-Nabisco shares.
Secondly, the company would delay declaring any dividends on the renamed
RN-Reynolds shares until 'there is a clear assessment of the domestic
tobacco operating environment and the company can initiate a dividend policy
that is consistent with its capital structure and credit rating targets'.
This group of shares will carry a 'pass-through' dividend of about three
cents a share from the third quarter of 1993 onwards, reflecting this
stock's retained interest in the dividend-paying food interests.

ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium and gold producer, yesterday announced a
26 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 80.9m (USDollars 57.4m) for
the first quarter to the end of March, on turnover up 3.4 per cent to
ADollars 505m.
The group, which is jointly owned by Aluminum Company of America and Western
Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, said it had
benefited from a weaker Australian dollar and new refinery capacity at
Wagerup.
It said the next instalment of capacity at Wagerup, which will increase
capacity by 200,000 tonnes a year to 1.7m tonnes per annum, would be speeded
up to come on stream in 1994.
The group declared a fully-franked dividend of ADollars 80m on March 31,
representing a return of 19.3 cents a share. It paid fully-franked dividends
of ADollars 260m during 1992.
People's Jewellers, the Canadian retail chain in bankruptcy protection, cut
its loss by more than half to CDollars 57.6m (USDollars 45.8m), or CDollars
4.72 a share, in the nine months to December 26, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. The chain operates 228 stores. Revenues dipped 9 per cent to
CDollars 145m.

CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday posted a
strong improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings, helped by a better
business climate and the television network's ability to command higher
advertising rates as it gains market share.
Net income in the first three months of 1993 was Dollars 54.2m, or Dollars
3.50, compared with a net loss of Dollars 64m, or Dollars 4.18, a year ago.
During the latest quarter, earnings benefited from a pre-tax gain of Dollars
19.2m on the sale of some marketable securities.
A year ago, CBS took a non-cash post-tax charge of Dollars 81.5m, or Dollars
5.32, for the adoption of new accounting standards.
The absence of the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl from CBS's winter
programming resulted in a 19 per cent decline in sales in the quarter to
Dollars 878.9m from Dollars 1.08bn. However, the sales gains from the 1992
special event sports broadcasts were largely offset by high rights fees and
related production and promotion costs.
CBS television, which languished for many years as the third-rated US
network, is starting to benefit from its relatively new-found place at the
head of the ratings table.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said: 'CBS has just begun
to capitalise both on its status as the nation's top-rated television
network and on its efforts to carefully contain costs'.
During the 1993 quarter, the television network benefited from improved unit
pricing and operating income in prime time and daytime entertainment and
news.
'The network's earnings also benefited from a shift in its programming mix,
airing more entertainment and news programmes and fewer special-event sports
programmes,' said Mr Tisch.
Advertising in New York and Los Angeles was weak in the 1993 quarter because
of sluggish regional economies.
On Wall Street, shares in CBS climbed Dollars 6 7/8 to a 52-week high of
Dollars 236 7/8 before the close.
CBS recently agreed to remain headquartered in Manhattan after it was
offered about Dollars 37.5m in city and state tax incentives and Dollars
12.2m in energy savings. In exchange, CBS has agreed to invest more than
Dollars 300m in building improvements, equipment and new technologies for
broadcasting and production.

THE New York Times Company, which owns 31 regional newspapers and a 50 per
cent stake in the International Herald Tribune, yesterday posted net income
of Dollars 10.9m, or 14 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 454.5m for the
1993 first quarter.
The company said a blizzard in March reduced pre-tax earnings by Dollars
3.7m, or 2 cents.
A year earlier, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 20m, or 26 cents,
on revenues of Dollars 435.9m. The results were distorted by a charge of
Dollars 33.4m, or 43 cents, for accounting changes.
The 1992 figures also included a pre-tax gain of Dollars 3.1m from the sale
of assets and an operating loss of of Dollars 1.7m from a Georgia paper
which closed in September.
The New York Times newspaper saw advertising lineage decline 4.8 per cent in
the first three months of 1993, reflecting continuing weakness in the
region's economy. Advertising lineage for the 31 regional newspapers
increased 6.2 per cent in the period, reflecting a rise in advertising
inserts. Operating income for the whole newspaper division fell to Dollars
28.6m from Dollars 32.7m.
Excluding the impact of the March snowstorm and a 1992 gain from the sale of
real estate, the group's operating profits rose to Dollars 32.3m from
Dollars 31.2m.
The magazines division recorded operating profits of Dollars 3.2m, compared
with Dollars 1.7m a year ago. Broadcasting and information services posted
operating earnings of Dollars 3.6m, against Dollars 2.8m last year.

TENNECO, the Texas-based diversified industrial company, saw earnings jump
in the first quarter, although revenues from all but its natural gas
operations were lower than a year ago.
The group reported income from continuing operations at Dollars 74m, or 46
cents per share, compared with Dollars 35m, or 22 cents, in the first
quarter of 1992.
Revenues were Dollars 3.25bn, against last year's Dollars 3.21bn.
The company's Case farm and construction equipment division trimmed its
quarterly operating loss to Dollars 17m, from last year's Dollars 77m. In
spite of the operating improvement, Case's revenues fell 9 per cent to
Dollars 814m.
Tenneco said that North American sales of farm and construction equipment
improved in the first quarter, but were offset by continuing declines in
Europe.
The company's natural gas pipeline operations saw revenues in the quarter
rise to Dollars 818m from Dollars 514m a year ago, while income from gas
operations rose Dollars 3m to Dollars 121m, from Dollars 118m last year.
Tenneco said the income gain was the result of higher pipeline volumes and
the inclusion of results from EnTrade, a gas marketing company acquired in
the fourth quarter of 1992.
During the first quarter, Case cut its worldwide production by 19 per cent
from the same period last year as part of its effort to control inventories
and balance production with demand.
The Newport News Shipbuilding division recorded income of Dollars 55m, up
marginally from Dollars 53m last year, in spite of a decline in sales to
Dollars 452m, from Dollars 584m last time.
Tenneco's Albright and Wilson chemicals business had flat results in the
quarter, with operating income at Dollars 15m. Revenues in the division fell
7 per cent because of recessionary pressures from Europe.
Operating income at the company's Packaging Corporation of America fell to
Dollars 37m from Dollars 49m, partly because the European recession weakened
worldwide linerboard prices.

GALERIES Lafayette, the French retailing group, plans to sell a 49 per cent
stake in Cofinoga, its credit and charge card business, to the Cetelem
group.
The news of the proposed disposal comes shortly after Galeries Lafayette
warned of a poor performance in 1992 due to the cost of servicing the debt
on its FFr2.9bn (Dollars 537m) bid for the Nouvelles Galeries retail chain
and the need to make steep provisions on its flagship store in New York.
Galeries Lafayette has confirmed that it stayed in the black in 1992 but
will only release specific profit figures when its full results are
published later this month.
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, is to increase
its holding in Banque Franco-Hellenique de Commerce International et
Maritime (BFH), an Athens-based bank, to 75 per cent by acquiring a 25 per
cent stake, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The French bank has agreed to buy the 25 per cent of BFH from the
state-owned National Investment Bank for Industrial Development (Eteva) for
an undisclosed sum. Eteva will retain the remaining 25 per cent. Under the
terms of the agreement, BFH, with a net worth of about Dr7bn (Dollars 32m),
will be expected to seek a listing on the Athens stock exchange within three
years.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Salomon debt downgraded by S&amp;P

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the US securities house, yesterday had about Dollars 8bn of
outstanding debt downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency. The
downgrade, which could push up the cost of Salomon's borrowings, reflected
the firm's reliance on proprietary trading activity 'which has increased its
vulnerability to quarterly earnings volatility,' S&amp;P said.
Salomon's longer-term senior debt rating was cut to Single A minus from
single A. Its subordinated debt rating fell to triple B plus from single A
minus. Preferred stock received a rating of triple B from triple B plus, and
the commercial paper rating was cut to A-2 from A-1.
Mr Donald Howard, chief financial officer said: 'In my view, some rating
agencies focus too heavily on the short-term volatility of Salomon's
earnings and give inadequate weight to our results measured over longer
time-frames and to the exceptional quality and liquidity of our assets.'
Mr Howard said that the volatility of short-term earnings was a result of
the firm's practice of valuing its inventory of securities on a
mark-to-market basis.
S&amp;P noted that Salomon's expected first-quarter loss was consistent with a
pattern of sharp quarterly fluctuations during the last year.
S&amp;P said the company's fixed income distribution business, and its trading
and other operations, had a strong earnings capacity and the company's
balance sheet was extremely liquid. Furthermore, the predicted first-quarter
loss was not expected to have a material impact on the firm's Dollars 4.3bn
equity base.

<TEXT>
WASTE Management, the world's largest rubbish hauler, said that it expected
to report flat earnings in the first quarter.
The Oakbrook-Illinois-based company's stock tumbled to a 52-week low this
week as investors became disillusioned with the company's growth potential.
Waste Management issued the earnings estimates on Tuesday, in response to
adverse Wall Street projections on the previous day. It will release
official results next week.
In spite of adding more than 400 sales people in North America last year,
Waste Management forecast first-quarter earnings of 40 cents per share to 41
cents per share.
This was little changed from last year's 39 cent first-quarter results.
It's publicly-traded subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, is also
anticipating flat results for the quarter, at Dollars 29m or 15 cents per
share.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse posts Dollars 64m
profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has encountered serious
problems within its financial services division and seen a variety of
management changes recently, yesterday posted profits of Dollars 64m after
tax in the first quarter.
The figure compares with a net loss of Dollars 246m in the same period of
1992, but this deficit largely reflected accounting-related charges.
Westinghouse said that first-quarter profits and sales from continuing
operations were flat year-on-year, at Dollars 64m, compared with Dollars
65m, and Dollars 1.86bn against Dollars 1.85bn, respectively.
Westinghouse's attempts to sort out its financial services division's
problems took a step forward last week when the company announced that it
would sell most of the commercial property loans held by this unit to a
newly-formed partnership, in which Lehman Brothers would be the general
partner and Westinghouse would have a 49 per cent interest.
The partnership, in turn, will attempt to offload the properties as quickly
as possible.
Yesterday, Westinghouse noted that its financial services unit had also sold
other assets, for about Dollars 700m in cash, during the first quarter -
proceeds which were in excess of the assets' reserved value.
Coupled with last week's announcement on the commercial property loans, Mr
Gary Clark, Westinghouse's acting chief executive, said that this left the
company's restructuring plan ahead of schedule. 'We expect to remain ahead
of plan throughout the year', he added.
However, Mr Clark added that any improvement in operating results would
probably be concentrated in the second half of 1993.
During the first three months, substantially improved sales and profits
figures from the power systems business and an advance on the broadcasting
side, were offset by declines in the electronics systems division, which
primarily makes military equipment, and in the industrial division.
However, Westinghouse shares, which rose modestly on news of the real estate
transaction, gained another Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 1/4 yesterday
morning.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Merrill shares lifted by record
first quarter

<TEXT>
SHARES in Merrill Lynch, the largest securities house in the US, rose
sharply yesterday after the company reported record first-quarter profits of
Dollars 342m, up 57 per cent from a year earlier.
The results included a one-off pre-tax lease charge of Dollars 103m for
offering vacated office space to other companies at Merrill's World
Financial Center headquarters in Manhattan.
Merrill's strong performance delighted investors, who bid up the company's
stock Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 in early trading on the New York stock
exchange.
There were revenue records in Merrill's four main business lines -
commissions, principal transactions, investment banking and asset management
and custodial fees.
This was an indication that the Wall Street earnings juggernaut, powered for
the past two years by low domestic interest rates and good demand from
investors and corporations for securities broking and underwriting services,
is not slowing down.
Revenues at Merrill reached a quarterly record of Dollars 3.96bn. The
biggest chunk came from principal transactions, the business of trading
securities for clients and for the company, which earned Dollars 755m.
Commission revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 714m, surpassing the previous
record set in the first quarter of 1987. Investment banking revenues were
also strong, up 23 per cent at Dollars 455m, as Merrill once again topped
the debt and equity underwriting tables in US and global capital markets.
Fees from asset management and custodial services rose 7 per cent to Dollars
236m, buoyed by a 12 per cent increase in client assets under management to
Dollars 145bn. Higher levels of interest earning assets, and favourable
interest rates spreads lifted net interest and dividend profit 29 per cent
to Dollars 256m.
Non-interest expenses rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1,923m, excluding the
one-off lease charge.

<TEXT>
SUEZ, one of France's most prominent industrial and financial holding
companies, yesterday confirmed that last year it made the first loss in its
135-year history with a FFr1.87bn (Dollars 346m) deficit, against net
profits of FFr3.84bn in 1991. The group, with interests including the
Indosuez bank and Victoire insurance group, has been the subject of takeover
speculation since it disclosed its loss earlier this year.
Suez made an operating loss of FFr610m last year, against an operating
profit of FFr5.07bn in 1991. It also suffered a sharp fall in exceptional
profits to FFr1.64bn from FFr2.16bn for the same period.
The group earlier warned that its property losses and provisions for 1992
would amount to FFr4.2bn. In spite of the fall into the red it has held its
dividend at FFr8.20.

<TEXT>
VNU, the largest publishing group in the Netherlands, is to sell its
printing division to De Boer Boekhoven, a Dutch printing group, in a cash
and paper deal that will leave it with a 30 per cent stake in the new
printing company.
The transaction will create the largest printing group in the Netherlands,
with annual turnover of Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 665m). It will enable VNU to
concentrate on its core publishing activities, in line with a strategy
pursued successfully by Elsevier and Wolters-Kluwer, the Netherlands' other
two dominant publishing groups, since the early 1980s.
VNU is to receive Fl 100m in cash, shares worth Fl 19m and 1.88m five-year
warrants in De Boer Boekhoven. It will provide the new printing group with a
Fl 40m subordinated loan and a Fl 18m convertible bond. Last month, it took
a Fl 80m charge on 1992, reflecting expectations that it would sell its
printing division for less than book value.
Mr Joep Brentjens, VNU's chairman, said VNU intended to hold its stake at
around 30 per cent, which meant that it may sell shares that it gains
through the conversion of loans or exercise of warrants.
De Boer Boekhoven is only one-third the size of the printing activities that
it will be acquiring from VNU. The Fl 100m in cash is to be provided by a
banking consortium led by ABN AMRO, which owns 42 per cent of De Boer
Boekhoven.

The French bank has agreed to buy the 25 per cent of BFH from the

Credit Lyonnais has managed BFH since it was set up 12 years ago when Greece
joined the European Community. In addition to trade financing, BFH has built
up a shipping portfolio and is expanding into private banking.
Eteva, an investment bank controlled by National Bank of Greece, the
country's largest state-owned bank, has been trying to dispose of its
holding in BHF for some time.
Eteva plans to move into commercial banking, building a network of branches
around Greece, as its development role has been curtailed by the
government's privatisation policy.

FFr1bn disposal

CGIP, the French holding company which recently raised its stake in the
CarnaudMetalBox packaging group, yesterday announced a fall in net profits
to FFr542m (Dollars 100.3m) last year from FFr672m in 1991 and disclosed
plans to sell peripheral interests to finance the CarnaudMetalBox deal.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, chairman, said the group hoped to raise just
over FFr1bn, the money it had spent on its new CarnaudMetalBox shares. He
said the proposed disposals would include CGIP's remaining 2 per cent stake
in the Valeo industrial group together with property in the Netherlands.
CGIP, which owns 25.3 per cent of CarnaudMetalBox, announced earlier this
month that it was buying an additional 7 per cent holding, the maximum
allowed by the French stock market authorities.
It bought the shares from MB-Caradon, the UK building products group which
was selling its entire 25.3 per cent stake.
The other shares have been bought by a consortium of investors allied to
CGIP.
CGIP funded the CarnaudMetalBox transaction with its FFr650m cash balance
and FFr450m provided by Orange-Nassau, its Dutch subsidiary. Mr Seilliere
said it was not essential that the group should recover the whole cost of
the deal, but that it did hope to rebuild finances.
CarnaudMetalBox was one of the best performers within the CGIP group last
year.
Mr Seilliere said it made a healthy increase in its contribution to the
group. Cedest, the cement company, was stable and Bio Participations, its
medical business, suffered a slight fall in profits.
However, CGIP was hit by a sharp reduction of FFr140m in the contribution
from Sogeti, the French computer services company, which fell into the red
last year, thereby triggering the overall fall in group net profits.
Mr Seilliere said the outlook for 1993 was very uncertain. CGIP budgeted for
a modest increase in profits this year but, he said, the first few months
had been very difficult. He said the group's chances of returning to profits
growth would be determined by the prospects for the second half of the year.

JACOBS SUCHARD, the Swiss confectionery group owned by Philip Morris, has
purchased a 50 per cent share in one of Turkey's largest edible oils
companies. The acquisition will allow the Swiss group to market its products
in Turkey and the six Turkic-speaking republics of former Soviet central
Asia.
The Swiss company paid an undisclosed sum for the stake in Marsa Margarine
Sanayi, a subsidiary of Sabanci Holding, Turkey's second-largest industrial
group. This is Jacobs Suchard's first move into Turkey, and underlines
growing foreign interest in the Turkish foods sector.
Marsa made sales of Dollars 171m in 1992, and is market leader in edible
oils, margarine and bottled spring water.
Jacobs Suchard by buying into an existing business, instead of green field
investment, will obtain immediate market access, a distribution network, a
list of local brands, and a base to introduce its own well-known brands such
as Toblerone, Sucard and Milka. The company said it planned to invest in
manufacturing in Turkey in 1994.
In parallel moves, Unilever bought out the local Komili vegetable oils group
last year, in the first example of a foreign buyer paying goodwill for a
Turkish brand. Corn Products, the US owner of the Knorr brand name, bought
out its local partner.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: A branch less fruitful than expected - Bids
are invited for Meyna, PPI's Turkish offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Polly Peck International should say goodbye to any lingering
hope of significant cash remittances from Meyna, the company's Turkish fruit
and packaging subsidiary.
Figures contained in a confidential 'information memorandum' sent to
prospective buyers, reveal a company currently turning over barely a fifth
of the sales reported in PPI's consolidated accounts before the group went
into administration in October 1990 owing banks and other creditors Pounds
1.13bn.
Whatever may have been the impression in the City of Meyna's contribution to
PPI's reported profits of Pounds 107m from its near and Middle East
operations - out of a group total of Pounds 161m - Meyna would now appear to
be a medium-sized business, with negligible exports, and about a 5 per cent
share of a highly competitive local market.
The decision to invite bids ends one of the more frustrating chapters in a
27-month administration to recover the Turkish assets of the UK-based fruit
and electronics group. According to Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the two UK
accountancy firms in charge of the administration, Meyna is being sold on
the basis of the company's own unaudited management and tax accounts -
figures which have not been 'independently verified,' the memorandum says.
'We're confident the numbers on which the sale is being made give a fair
picture of the group,' said Mr Stuart Smith, the Coopers partner in charge
of disposal of the Turkish companies, who said the administrators hoped to
be in a position to conclude the sale in a few weeks.
As early as May 1991, the administrators warned that Meyna's trading
performance as reported in Polly Peck's accounts 'may be significantly
overstated.'
However, it is unlikely that many of PPI's 23,000 creditors envisaged quite
the magnitude of the discrepancy.
Meyna incurred net losses - after general and administrative expenses - in
1990, 1991, and the nine months to September 1992. In contrast, the
administrators had established from records at Polly Peck's London
headquarters that Meyna had reported revenues of TL578bn (Pounds 140m) and
trading profits of TL195bn for the first six months of 1990. The local
management accounts reveal a much more modest performance. For the whole of
1990 Meyna's sales totalled TL251bn for a gross profit of just TL13bn.
Equally modest, the group's assets were valued at TL129bn (Pounds 31m). This
is hard to match with Turkish Treasury figures which show Meyna as the
second largest UK capital investment - Vestel, PPI's Istanbul electronics
subsidiary, being the largest.
Turkish fruit traders, however, were always clear about the size of Meyna.
'If Meyna stopped producing tomorrow it would have absolutely no effect on
the market here,' said the owner of one of largest fruit companies.
'I think they'll get a very rude shock when they try to sell the group,'
said another competitor.
Bids are invited for Meyna, the group's fresh fruit arm, Meysin, a fruit
concentrate business, and Unipac, a small corrugated box factory at Adana,
the only subsidiary currently reporting profits.
Mr Fahri Gorgulu, the company's chief executive and former head of the
Turkish police, confirmed that Meysan, a sunflower oil refiner, Kaynak, a
wholesaler, and Niksar, PPI's bottled water plant, had been sold to Mr Sudi
Ozkan, a local casino owner.
Because of the share structure and inter-company balances, only part of the
proceeds have been remitted to PPI - the balance was reinvested in the Meyna
group. However, the deal is not expected to generate a large sum. Meysan has
little in the way of assets, while Kaynak has ceased operations in Ankara,
Adana and Izmir.
'What we have left are the Meysan sites at Adana and Mersin and the three
other packing houses. It's a conventional marketing and auctioning
operation,' said Mr Smith.
The administrators are talking to 'a number of interested parties'. Their
preference is to sell the whole operation, but they will consider the sale
of individual units.
However, their efforts to sell could be hampered by current market
conditions. The fruit sector is currently awash with excess capacity,
following last year's sale of two state-owned fruit juice companies - Meysu
and Guneysu. Traders say there may be interest from a business downstream,
but here the government's planned share offering in Sek, its dairy
corporation, could dampen enthusiasm.
Meyna may have some of the most modern facilities in Turkey, but there is
unlikely to be much additional value put on Meyna's brand names - Fresh, its
fruit juice, being its best known. Moreover, the properties, while close to
the citrus groves, are far from the apple, peach, apricot and cherry
regions, an important consideration when fruit businesses are trying to
diversify product lines to maximise factory utility rates.
Given that the company is suffering losses, one London analyst suggested it
was doubtful any buyer would pay more than net asset value and 'in fact more
likely a discount to net asset value.' Meyna's net asset value was put at
TL194bn in 1991.
Certainly, there has been an impact on the balance sheet. Already, banks are
restricting credit lines, while suppliers demand cash payment. As a result,
the group is now working on a contract basis, no longer buying fruit on its
own account.
Meyna has been forced to sell one of its five packing houses and another was
closed. The Unipac cardboard box facility at Adana is working at about 50
per cent capacity. Since the administration, the fresh produce operation has
withdrawn from trading in pulses, raisins and nuts.
The administrators say they are marketing the companies on the basis of
their present trading performance. Anything else would be 'entering the area
of the unknown'.
However, a buyer may find it difficult to make an assessment of the group's
potential, without figures for the period prior to the administration, which
Meyna's management has declined to provide.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sykes-Pickavant, the USM-quoted manufacturer of hand tools and diagnostic
equipment, reported another downturn in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds
629,000, compared with Pounds 731,000 previously and Pounds 1.19m for 1990.
Turnover improved from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 18.7m, reflecting an increase
in export sales and a full year's trading from Auto Service Products.
After a lower tax charge, earnings per share were 6.23p (5.25p) but the
final dividend is halved to 1.75p for a total of 4p (5.75p).
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 511,000, mainly related to
writing off the investment in Motortest of Germany.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rich rewards from white-collar focus - A
look at Capita and its strategy for success in the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 170 finance staff from the London borough of Bromley will soon
become employees of Capita Group, which has expanded rapidly by offering
management services to the public sector.
Capita's market value has grown seven-fold, to Pounds 72m, since flotation
in 1989. Pre-tax profits have surged from Pounds 700,000 in that year to
Pounds 4.41m in 1992, on sales of Pounds 33.1m.
Unlike other private contractors which have moved in on the public sector,
Capita focuses on high-value, high-margin activities such as revenue
collection and computers, rather than refuse collection or school meals.
Mr Paul Pindar, Capita's managing director, said: 'Providing blue-collar
services is not our bag.' He believes that methods used by other operators
to win public sector contracts - such as cutting the wages and conditions of
staff - are not sustainable in the long term.
The Bromley employees, who voted 98 per cent in favour of Capita's offer
from a choice of three, will transfer on their existing terms and
conditions. Under the Pounds 24m contract Capita will, for the next five
years, manage most of the borough's exchequer services - including payroll,
pensions, business rates, council tax and benefits.
Capita estimates that it will save the council Pounds 1m over the life of
the contract, which is three times the size of any previous 'outsourcing' of
white-collar services in local government. It also said new opportunities
would be created for the Bromley staff, who have seen their workload
diminished by recent changes, such as the move from community charge to
council tax.
Although more than 80 per cent of the group's revenues come from work in the
public sector, Capita's distinctive contribution has been to apply
sophisticated private-sector business techniques to the traditional
activities of local authorities and government agencies - particularly the
collection of revenue.
Mr Pindar said: 'We want to be in areas that fit - quality areas, with
significant margins. That's why we went after revenue - if we can put
together something which brings in more cash, then everyone wins.'
On behalf of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Capita employs up to
80 people using computerised telephone systems to deal with sales and
inquiries for personalised number plates. Since starting in October 1990, it
has sold more than 200,000 number plates and raised more than Pounds 100m
for the Treasury.
Telephoning people at their homes during the evening can be an effective way
of raising money. The latest technology from the US allows one operator to
make 25-30 calls per hour and be provided with the details of the particular
account on a screen when each connection is made. When Capita recently was
contracted to call 100,000 people whose TV licence payments were overdue,
nearly half of the 60,000 successfully contacted went out and bought a
licence soon afterwards.
It was success rates like that which encouraged local authorities of all
different political persuasions to use Capita to help collect poll tax.
In spite of offering services which have been championed by the
Conservatives, Capita claims it would not have been upset by a Labour
victory at the last general election. Mr Pindar said: 'We were unconcerned
about the prospect of either a Tory or Labour government - but a hung
parliament might have brought decision-making to a halt.'
To date, Capita has employed local authority staff when taking over
contracts, but Mr Pindar said: 'Once we have major operating centres, we
will offer deals to local authorities which do not involve the transfer of
staff.'
Following a European directive, employees whose jobs are transferred from
one employer to another are protected under the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations. Capita takes a cautious view of its
obligations under the rules, and has fulfilled all of their conditions for
the staff it has acquired.
If Capita took on the work but not the employees for a contract, it says the
Tupe obligations would have to be honoured - probably by the local or
central government department contracting out the work.
The Bromley staff will join Capita's existing workforce of 850, which is
divided between two divisions - outsourcing and advisory, which provides
consultancy and training services.
Capita's shares enjoy a premium rating - partly because of its rapid history
of growth and partly due to the group's expanding opportunities, as
'outsourcing' spreads from local authorities to the NHS and into the heart
of central government.
Although analysts remain bullish about the stock, some point out that it is
difficult to evaluate Capita's contracts, which are both large and
long-term. BZW says: 'Capita's businesses are complex and the nature of some
of them is such as not to lend themselves to external analysis. Were
something to go awry, there may be little warning.
Mr Pindar responds by pointing to the expertise of the seven-strong board,
which includes five accountants. The business started in the early eighties
when Mr Rod Aldridge, the current chairman, established a computer services
company for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. In
1989, a management buy-out was supported by 3i, the venture capital group.
Mr Pindar said: 'We are never going to go in and bid just on price. We
recently walked away from a contract worth Pounds 10m, on which we had put
in nine months' work. In five out of six of the large information technology
contracts we won, we were not the cheapest bidder.'
Mr Richard Childs, a director, believes contracts are awarded on the basis
of quality, added value, price and treatment of staff - in that order.
He said: 'We manage the treasurer's lifeblood. If we screw up, the treasurer
is going to lose his job.'

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: FR Group shows 9% improvement to Pounds
23.3m - Healthy niches in aviation and defence markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 9 per cent at Pounds 23.3m
for the year to December 31 as the company appeared to demonstrate there are
some healthy niches within the depressed aviation and defence markets.
Cutbacks in the aviation programmes of most aircraft makers, however, meant
the company was continuing to rationalise that side of the business in the
face of 'a significant downturn in demand' from the high levels of the late
1980s.
Sales were also up 9 per cent at Pounds 182.8m while earnings per share rose
7 per cent to 21.48p.
A proposed final dividend of 4.74p brings the total for the year to 7.2p, up
8 per cent.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said that while the aerospace and defence
industries were experiencing significant falls in demand there remained
continuing demand for FR's products and services.
On its military side, governments were going to spend an increasingly large
slice of the smaller defence cake on products and services like FR's
surveillance, high tech training capability and its air-to-air refueling
systems.
On the aviation side, Mr Page said FR was reacting to the flow of cutbacks
in civilian aircraft programmes by the likes of McDonnell Douglas, Airbus
and Boeing by closing some sites and developing an ability to supply
integrated systems rather than components on their own.
The group was cutting 170 jobs this year and last and was closing one
factory and integrating the operations of two others. Substantially all the
associated cost had been provided within the 1992 accounts.
FR ended the year with net cash of Pounds 9.4m, up from Pounds 7.8m, in
spite of an increased interest charge on un-hedged foreign exchange
denominated debt.
The company has also begun to develop non-military applications for the
technology involved in air-to-air refueling.
Mr Page said the company should this year announce a venture in which it
would be able to apply its fluid handling and couplings technology and
expertise in the petrochemical or water treatment industries.
COMMENT
Western countries are for some time going to spend considerable amounts on
defence, notwithstanding the peace dividend they are all trying to cash. The
trick for investors is to differentiate between those companies
metaphorically making submarines and those supplying what the armed forces
will continue to need. Judging by the 40 per cent increase in FR's share
price since last October, the company has gone some way towards
demonstrating it might be a defence contractor with one of the rosier
futures. But FR cannot avoid the pain being felt in aviation, even if it has
now put what should be a lucrative components business on a sounder footing.
Profits forecast at Pounds 25m for this year, would give earnings of 23.2p,
and a prospective p/e that might appear relatively cheap at 12 times. On
balance this price level is, however, probably about right.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Flotation puts Pounds 70m price tag on RPC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RPC GROUP, the rigid plastic packaging company, yesterday confirmed its
plans for a flotation in May. The float is expected to value the group at
more than Pounds 70m, compared with its Pounds 33.4m management buy-out two
years ago.
The issue is expected to raise more than enough new money to repay Pounds
21.5m of preference shares, including Pounds 13.5m issued to former owners
Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden at the time of the buy-out. Some existing
shareholders may also sell part of their investments.
The flotation involves a placing with institutions and an offer to the
public through financial intermediaries.
The prospectus will include results for the year to March 31 which are
expected to show an advance on the Pounds 5m operating profit recorded in
1991-92. The group has little debt, having repaid Pounds 12m of buy-out debt
from cashflow and invested another Pounds 12m in the last two years.
RPC is chaired by Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, formerly a director of Rowntree
Mackintosh, the confectionery group, who joined in January 1992. He is also
a non-executive director of Argos and Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society.
RPC's executive directors have all been with the group through a number of
ownership changes. The company was originally part of Reed International,
the publishing company, but was sold with Reed's other packaging interests
to Reedpack, a buy-out vehicle, in 1988.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Board changes at Bullers' Britannia
Collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BULLERS, the manufacturer and marketer of giftware, fine art and decorative
accessory products, yesterday announced the resignation of one of its
directors, Mr Terence Mason.
Mr Mason was managing director of the Britannia Collection, the group's
principal trading subsidiary.
His departure follows the resignation of Mr Peter McBride, the group's
managing director, announced in February.
Lord Even of Winton, Levend Beriker and Mr John Goodger have been appointed
directors of the Britannia Collection and will fulfil Mr Mason's former
executive responsibilities, the company said.
Earlier this month Bullers announced losses trimmed to Pounds 450,000
pre-tax for the half year to December 31 compared with Pounds 497,000 after
stripping out losses of Pounds 838,000 for discontinued operations.
The company's share price dropped in late 1990 after it revealed pre-tax
losses of Pounds 2.33m for the first half of the year against a Pounds
195,000 profit.
At the same time the company disclosed an exceptional provision of Pounds
360,000 against money owed by the Iraqi government including debt for large
Islamic swords pictured in television reports.
The following year the decorative accessories division suffered when a
majority of the staff at Glenlomond Fire Surrounds left and set up a rival
firm.
The company restructured its finances last year.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Union Intl back into black with Pounds
32.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE elimination of Union International's loss-making businesses through
disposal and reorganisation helped turn a pre-tax loss of Pounds 102.3m into
pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.5m after exceptionals for the year ended
December 31.
During the last year the group sold many of its non-core activities,
including the Australian pastoral land and cattle herd and its meatworks
business, for about Pounds 80m.
However, as reported in February, preference shareholders will have to wait
for any dividend until after the refinancing schedule is met at the end of
December 1994.
A tight control of operational costs and a substantial reduction in central
group overheads was mainly responsible for an increase in operating profits
from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 44.9m on reduced sales of Pounds 1bn (Pounds
1.3bn).
The UK division made profits before exceptionals and interest of Pounds 8.3m
compared to a loss of Pounds 25.9m. The Dewhurst butcher suppliers were
reduced from 1,200 to 200, and for the first time in a number of years the
meat chain made a profit.
Property in the UK traded at a reduced loss and made sales of Pounds 30m,
which included the disposal of the Dewhurst retail units.
Union's Australia and New Zealand businesses increased profits from Pounds
7.7m to Pounds 29.6m. The division sold its pastoral and meatworks
operations and made a number of property disposals.
Profits from the Far East rose from Pounds 636,000 to Pounds 4m on the back
of Union's own branded products of meat and canned product. Turnover in this
area has shown an increase of 24 per cent and profits a 71 per cent rise
over the past two years.
Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, said: 'Considerable emphasis is now
being placed on the importance of and value of the group's brands.'
Europe, excluding the UK, turned a Pounds 947,000 loss into a profit of
Pounds 1.3m.
The only weak spot was South America and the West Indies which saw profits
almost half from Pounds 32.5m to Pounds 16.5m.
A net cash inflow of Pounds 96.1m compared with a cash outflow of Pounds
5.9m.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hostile Pounds 1.2m bid made for Plateau
Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HOSTILE bid was made last night for Plateau Mining, the former natural
resources company which is now a shell with no employees, no liabilities or
overheads but more than Pounds 1m in cash.
The all-share bid, worth Pounds 1.2m, is by Kingstream Resources, a small
Australian exploration company which wants Plateau's cash to pay for a
feasibility study for an integrated iron ore mine and a steel mini-mill
project in Western Australia.
The offer, of 1 Kingstream ordinary for every 8 Plateau ordinary, values
each Plateau share at 2.62p compared with the recent suspension price of 3p.
Plateau was floated at 90p a share in January 1990.
Guinness Mahon, acting for Plateau, described the Kingstream offer as
'unbelievable' because, not only was it hostile, but it also offered less
than the cash in the company.
Kingstream is being advised by Ionian Corporate Finance.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Packer stake in Fairfax 'welcome'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black said yesterday that Mr Kerry Packer was 'a welcome
shareholder' in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which Mr
Black has a 15 per cent stake, held through The Telegraph. Last week Mr
Packer doubled his stake in Fairfax to 10 per cent, raising speculation of a
takeover battle between the two.
Mr Black said that he was 'optimistic' that he would get government approval
next week to increase his interest in Fairfax to 25 per cent.
He said Mr Packer's move was in line with what he had told Mr Black he would
do beforehand, and 'there is nothing sinister in it at all. We see him as an
ally'.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph's Southam deal approved -
'Exacting procedure' to obtain minorities' consent for Pounds 72.3m
acquisition of stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORITY shareholders in The Telegraph, which is 68 per cent owned by Mr
Conrad Black's Hollinger, yesterday approved a deal under which The
Telegraph will buy half Hollinger's stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper
group, for Pounds 72.3m.
The special meeting held to consider the deal lasted only five minutes.
The Hollinger shares were not allowed to be voted at the meeting yesterday
afternoon. Of the shares eligible to vote, proxies were received from 53.52
per cent in favour of the deal and 1.44 per cent against. That meant that
95.9 per cent of votes cast approved the deal.
At the meeting the resolution was carried unanimously, and shareholders who
attended did not ask any questions.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Black said that the vote was 'a very good
turn-out' for an EGM. He said 'if any shareholder had any significant
concern they would not have abstained. An abstention is an indication of
tacit approv-al.'
The deal - under which The Telegraph will buy shares in Southam at CDollars
18.10 each - had aroused comment when it was revealed that shortly after The
Telegraph's independent directors had approved and posted a circular to
shareholders recommending it, Power Corporation, the Canadian company which
is run by Mr Paul Desmarais, had agreed to buy a stake in Southam at
CDollars 14 a share.
Power and Hollinger, which each hold 18.8 per cent of Southam's shares, also
came to a shareholder agreement.
The Telegraph then had to issue a supplementary circular, describing the new
circumstances, in which the independent directors again recommended the
deal.
Mr Black said yesterday that Power had put a proposal to Southam prior to
the first circular going out but Southam had declined. 'I had no reason to
believe that Power wished to proceed,' he said.
'I wish now that the first circular had not gone out. I had no idea that
discussions with Power would revive and be fruitful.'
He said the first circular had been approved at a meeting on the morning of
March 13 in London, and he had heard from Power that evening in Florida
after which 'things moved quickly'.
He also said that if there had been 'any way of getting a lower price' for
the shares bought by Hollinger he would have.
He described the process of gaining approval from The Telegraph's minority
shareholders for the deal as 'an exacting procedure'.
He said that now Southam's management could proceed with plans to cut
overmanning at the group, which has 7,500 employees, and that provisions had
been made in previous accounts to cover 1,300 redundancies.

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Scotland is to sell its 30 per cent stake in Dorian Bank, the
Athens-based private concern controlled by Mr John Mavrakakis, a Greek
shipowner, following Dorian's decision to expand into commercial lending.
Mr Antony Mantzavinos, president of Dorian, said yesterday that 'a friendly
separation' had been agreed.
Mr Mavrakakis, who holds the other 70 per cent of Dorian, is to buy the
British bank's stake through Dorian Hellenic, a holding company.
He said negotiations were under way with several Greek investors interested
in taking minority holdings and contributing to a capital increase for the
bank.
Bank of Scotland took an equity stake in Dorian when it was set up three
years ago to provide merchant banking and ship financing services in Greece.
The bank's capital base of Dr2.2bn (Pounds 6.6m) was raised to Dr5bn last
year.
'The market has developed differently and we're changing our strategy,
expanding into commercial banking, which is not the focus of Bank of
Scotland's foreign activities,' Mr Mantzavinos said.
After reporting losses of Dr647m in 1991, its first full year of operation,
Dorian forecast net profits of Dr300m for last year.
Bank of Scotland acknowledged that the change in market conditions in Greece
had forced Dorian to re-focus its strategy away from fee-earning services to
include more corporate lending and other medium term credit products, which
would require increased capital to support future growth. As a result the
attraction of continuing as a shareholder in Dorian 'has diminished', it
said.
Mr Jim Malcolm, assistant general manager of Bank of Scotland's
international division, said the reasons for withdrawing from the Dorian
operations were specific to that market.
'This is not a change of strategy as far as Europe is concerned,' he said,
'we are still very interested.'

FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Private client brokers merge in Pounds 7m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BREWIN Dolphin Holdings, the London-based private client stockbroker, has
acquired Bell Lawrie White from the TSB Group in a deal believed to be worth
Pounds 7m.
The acquisition creates one of Britain's largest private client
stockbrokers, and follows a growing trend among those organisations to
revert to the historic partnership structures which were held until they
were purchased at hefty premiums by international banks in the run up to Big
Bang in 1986.
'Firms such as ours with emphasis on private client business don't have much
in common with large integrated firms,' said Mr John Hall, managing director
of Brewin Dolphin.
'Many of us became unstuck because we fell between two stools in the new
structures and didn't know what it was we were supposed to do.'
Brewin Dolphin was the object of a management buy-out from SE Banken last
year, which had bought the partnership for itself in 1986.
The consideration includes the cost of repayment of BLW's debts.
The enlarged firm will approximately double Brewin Dolphin's client base to
about 32,000 and its assets under management will increase to some Pounds
4bn.
BLW's management will become partners owning 25 per cent of the equity; two
other investors, the venture capital firms of Baronsmead and 3i, will have
15 per cent and the remainder will be held by Brewin Dolphin's management.
Of the funds under management, about Pounds 600m will be managed on a
discretionary basis. Brewin Dolphin will retain the research capacity of BLW
and will concentrate on smaller companies and Scottish companies.

FT  14 APR 93 / Queens Moat calls in finance consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW COPPEL, the former finance director of jewellery group Ratners,
has been appointed as a consultant to Queens Moat Houses to mastermind the
financial reconstruction of the troubled hotels group.
Mr Coppel said it was 'not appropriate' to join Queens Moat's board until
its financial position became clearer.
Mr Coppel, who left Ratners in April 1990 before the group ran into
financial difficulties, said one of his first priorities was to improve
Queens Moat's management information systems.
Further details emerged of Queens Moat's financial condition. A preliminary
estimate by Grant Thornton, the accountants, shows that profits before
interest and depreciation charges were Pounds 106m in 1992.
'That shows the group is viable,' a banker said. The group's 64 bank
creditors, which are owed Pounds 1bn, are hopeful that the eventual
financial restructuring will not involve conversion of debt into equity,
though it might require some deferment of interest and rescheduling of
principal payments.
However Grant Thornton believes Queens Moat made a pre-tax loss in the year
of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 80m. The accountants have not fully
quantified the effect on profits of the way that Queens Moat accounted for
revenues derived from management incentive contracts. Under these contracts
managers promised to earn specified revenues for the group during the
forthcoming financial year but Queens Moat booked these revenues as profits
for the previous financial year.
Last year, as the hotel industry went into recession, the managers delivered
less profit than Queens Moat had booked.
Barclays, which is chairing a steering committee of the banks, has asked
bank creditors to agree to a two-month standstill, involving the suspension
of all interest and principal payments for that period. The standstill
request also involves a freeze on banks' rights to take possession of Queens
Moat deposits.
Some banks would like to use these deposits to reduce their loans to Queens
Moat. However, Barclays believes that the group's survival depends on its
ability to draw on these cash reserves to continue trading.

FT  14 APR 93 / The price of the boss's options: US executives face growing
pressure on their pay-packets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
April is proving to be an ambiguous month for top-earning executives in the
US. First, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed
hard-hitting measures which would make companies report the value of share
options granted to employees and subtract them from profits. Then  - only
days later - the Clinton administration, which has been threatening strict
new rules to limit the tax deductibility of seven-figure executive pay,
softened its stance.
Discontent over the remuneration levels enjoyed by top US executives has
been rumbling for years. It has, however, been exacerbated by recession.
When companies are losing money and employees are losing jobs, the sight of
executives netting millions has become distasteful to investors, workers and
politicians alike. For example, in 1991, Chrysler's Mr Lee Iaccoca earned
nearly Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) when the car company lost Dollars 795m.
Share options - rights to buy a certain number of shares at a pre-determined
'exercise' price - have been a favourite way for US companies to increase
employee incentive without discernibly hurting profits.
Employees involved in such schemes have a reason to work for a higher share
price; while the company is not obliged to pay out cash, merely to
distribute shares. This will eventually dilute earnings per share, but
usually by a modest amount.
The popularity of such arrangements was demonstrated in a recent survey of
500 start-up companies by VentureOne, a San Francisco-based research
company. About 97 per cent of the companies questioned had some form of
share option scheme.
For top executives these arrangements have become hugely lucrative. Last
year, Primerica's Mr Sanford Weill was granted new options on 3.65m shares,
at an average exercise price of Dollars 27 a share. The subsequent sharp
rise in Primerica's stock means that he is already showing a paper profit of
more than Dollars 70m although all the options cannot be exercised at this
stage.
Nor can share options always be justified as a long-term management
incentive. In the pharmaceuticals sector, Merck's Mr Roy Vagelos was granted
options on shares worth Dollars 25.6m at last year's exercise price. Mr
Vagelos will retire at the end of 1994.
Because stock options do not involve a cash outlay, they are not listed
among a company's expenses. However, when em-ployees cash in their options
at a profit, companies are allowed to deduct this surplus from their income
for tax purposes.
What FASB is proposing is a three-year interim period, during which
companies must come to grips with techniques for estimating 'fair value' of
employee options and prepare for the new accounting requirement.
From 1997 however, options will be recognised as expenses on the day they
are granted and charged against profits - although the expense would be
stretched over the vesting period for the options.
Quite how the 'fair value' of the options would be calculated is debatable.
'It's not all that complicated for companies to do,' said the board. 'All
we've stated is that companies should use an option-pricing model, like the
Black-Scholes model. These models are used now by option traders and others,
and take into account interest rates, stock price today and volatility to
produce a value for the options.'
Corporate America, which had hoped the board would limit its interference to
more stringent disclosure standards without a charge against profits, has so
far been muted in its criticism. But the board can expect a chorus of
corporate disapproval during a six-month comment period which will follow
publication in June of its formal exposure draft.
Ironically, the board's attempt to introduce flexibility for companies may
trigger the loudest denunciation. It seems unlikely that the FASB will hold
companies to any specific pricing model, and there have already been
complaints about the confusion this will create.
There is also no consensus on the degree to which the plans would deplete
reported profits. Estimates range from as little as 2 per cent to as much as
10 per cent. It is certain that that some companies will change the way they
reward employees. Critics of the plan argue that it will hit smaller and
newer companies hardest, and that middle management will suffer more than
top management if companies cut back on stock options.
The VentureOne survey gives weight to some of these charges. While only 10
per cent of respondents said they would eliminate options altogether, 88 per
cent they would reduce the number of employees receiving options.
Furthermore, nearly half said options would be offered to key executives
only. Some bigger companies, such as Merck and Pepsi, say they hope to
retain their stock option programmes.
Just as US corporations were starting to grapple with the board's proposals,
however, they were offered some consolation by the US Treasury.
Earlier this year the Clinton administration had suggested that companies
should only be able to deduct salaries in excess of Dollars 1m when
calculating taxable profits, if the pay was linked to the company's
performance.
More detailed proposals put forward by the Treasury suggest that
performance-linked pay would include not only commissions or other earnings
based directly on an executive's percentage of sales, but also any
compensation package based on performance standards approved by the
company's shareholders.
The ban on deductibility would affect only the chief executive and the four
other highest paid executives in a company. Compensation plans already in
place before the measure was outlined on February 17 would be exempt.
Some senior Wall Street executives welcomed the more relaxed stance on
deductibility of large pay awards. One expressed his relief: 'Wall Street
firms do spend a lot of money on people, so broad notions of a cap on the
deductibility of compensation above Dollars 1m would have used tax policy in
a way that discouraged businesses which invest in human capital instead of
plant and equipment. However, the present approach is much more in line with
traditional tax policy . . . and the new proposals deal with the issue in a
relatively rational way.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Berlusconi plans publishing float
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FININVEST, the privately-owned media and financial services group of Italy's
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is poised to raise cash by merging and floating its
main publishing activities.
The scheme, which has to be given a formal go-ahead by Mr Berlusconi,
involves merging Silvio Berlusconi Editore, Fininvest's magazine publishing
and industrial printing business, with Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher,
which Fininvest controls.
Shares in the amalgamated unit, which would have annual sales of about
L2,000bn (Pounds 839m), would be offered to domestic and international
investors, with Fininvest retaining 51 per cent.
The proceeds would be used to bring down the group's debts, officially about
L3,000bn, although some bankers put the total higher.
'We are looking seriously at these hypotheses, but no final decision has
been made,' said a Fininvest spokesman.
Last week SBE bought 20 per cent of Mondadori's ordinary shares from the
Fininvest parent company. No price for the intra-group transaction was
disclosed. However, the transfer has been seen as a first step to the merger
between the two publishing operations later this year.
Goldman Sachs and Banca Commerciale Italiana have been appointed to advise
on the deal. However, bankers note that Mr Berlusconi, on whom the ultimate
decision rests, has not yet fully committed himself to go ahead. Two years
ago, the widely-expected flotation of Fininvest's Silvio Berlusconi
Communications film subsidiary was shelved because of opposition from Mr
Berlusconi. However, bankers believe a cash-raising exercise is much more
likely now in view of the greater financial pressures on his group.
The merger of SBE with Mondadori is likely to come through a reverse
takeover, which would precede placing a large proportion of the shares in
the combined unit.
SBE is best known for publishing Italy's biggest-selling magazine, 'TV
Sorrisi e Canzoni'. The company made net profits of L29.7bn on sales of
L320bn in 1992. Mondadori is Italy's biggest book publisher, and also has
sizeable magazine interests. Sales amounted to L1,600bn last year.
Bankers believe up to 40 per cent of the shares could be placed with foreign
investors.

FT  14 APR 93 / Royal Bank to buy Boston Five Bancorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Bank of Scotland's fast growing US banking subsidiary, Citizens
Financial, is paying Dollars 95m (Pounds 62.9m) in cash to acquire Boston
Five Bancorp as part of its New England expansion.
The acquisition, which will be funded by Citizens without recourse to Royal
Bank shareholders, represents a significant step towards the bank's goal of
generating at least 10 per cent of its earnings from the US.
It also underlines the growing importance of the US banking operations run
by Mr Larry Fish, Citizens' chief executive. Last year Citizens, which
already has retail banking operations in Rhode Island and Massachusetts as
well as a Georgia-based mortgage company, contributed Pounds 19.7m to the
bank's profits.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's group chief executive, said yesterday:
'This acquisition is a further important step in our long term strategy in
the US. We intend that Citizens should double in size in the next three
years while becoming the leading community bank in southern New England.'
The deal will make Citizens the sixth largest bank holding company in New
England with Dollars 6.4bn of assets. At the end of January, Boston Five had
total assets of Dollars 1.7bn.
Some 25 offices will be added to Citizens Bank of Massachusetts' 11
branches. Deposits will increase to Dollars 2.1bn.
The deal will double the size of Citizens' mortgage banking subsidiary's
portfolio to Dollars 8bn and rank the Gulf States Mortgage company among the
60 largest in the country.
'Doubling the size of our mortgage servicing operation fits our goal of
expanding our fee-generating business and our expansion into the Boston
market fits with our strategic mission for growth,' said Mr Fish.
In spite of the recession and a banking crisis in New England, Citizens has
thrived in recent years and has helped restore some faith in British banks'
US operations.
After enduring losses in the late 1980s, and debating how quickly they could
sell, the mood among some British banks towards their US subsidiaries has
changed considerably. As they struggle with bad debt at home, US operations
have become an attractive source of income for some banks including the
Royal Bank and National Westminster.

FT  14 APR 93 / Vestey arm plans disposals to concentrate on core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION INTERNATIONAL, the trading arm of the Vestey Group, is planning new
disposals as part of its strategy to develop into a smaller food processing
and distribution group.
The company yesterday reported profit before tax and exceptional items of
Pounds 30.8m in the year ended December 31, compared with a loss of Pounds
20.5m in the previous year.
An exceptional credit of Pounds 1.6m contrasts with the previous year's
exceptional loss of Pounds 81.8m, which mainly arose from losses on
disposals.
Net debt fell 38 per cent, from Pounds 327m to Pounds 202m, through sales
and reorganisation.
Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, said the group was already planning its
future after the completion of the refinancing at the end of next year. 'We
want to rebuild our fortunes by disposing of our non-core activities and
expand our core businesses.'
Union International, one of the UK's largest private companies, is to focus
on its food processing and distribution business.
Mr Robinson said he expected net debt to be 'well below Pounds 100m' by the
end of the year.
The group is to seek new equity for its meat operations in New Zealand.
Union is looking for an overseas investor to buy 30 per cent of Weddel New
Zealand, with the remaining 20 per cent sold through a public flotation.
It also plans to sell its international food processing and distribution
businesses based in Brazil. The group is close to finalising the sale of its
Brazilian farming interests - expected to fetch around Dollars 45m (Pounds
30m).
Sales of minor operations in other parts of Latin America, UK, Australia and
the Far East are also being considered.
Union's UK property portfolio, which includes office developments in the
City, has also been earmarked for sale. It has already been written down by
more than Pounds 60m over the past two years.
Under Mr Robinson's control, Union has reasserted its authority over its
subsidiaries, by capping capital expenditure and setting profit targets.
Union has formalised its refinancing agreements with its 70 banks in 25
countries through to December 1994.
Shareholders funds increased more than 40 per cent from Pounds 26.6m to
Pounds 37.9m.

FT  14 APR 93 / Printers win 3.7% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 10,000 print workers have won wage rises of more than 3.7 per cent
after a wage offensive by the Graphical, Paper and Media Union.
The union is targeting specific printing companies across Britain and
demanding that they meet the union's claim of a Pounds 6.50-a-week rise, an
extra day's holiday from January 1 1994 and pro rata conditions for
part-timers and temporary workers.
This follows the collapse of national industry talks. The current agreement
runs out on April 24 and deals are all being made at company level for the
first time in more than 50 years. The rises of over 3.7 per cent are more
than twice the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit.
If the companies refuse to accept what the union wants their employees are
being balloted for industrial action short of striking. Six companies are
being disrupted.
Mr Brian Willoughby, a GPMU national officer, said yesterday: 'Our campaign
is going from strength to strength. Companies are settling with us on our
terms across the country.'
Agreements have been concluded with the St Ives Group, Severn Valley Press,
the Bemrose group, Lawson Mardon, Ferry Pickering and the Howitts group. The
union estimates 15 per cent of its members have so far secured deals on
union terms.
Even John Waddington company has negotiated a deal satisfactory to the union
although its chairman is Mr Victor Watson, president of the employers' body,
the British Printing Industry Federation. The GPMU is now targeting
companies in the north-east.
The union's campaign follows the collapse of pay talks with the employers
who made a final offer (now withdrawn) worth 1.7 per cent or Pounds 2.92 a
week on basic minimum rates.
The employers' federation said there was a 'great variation' in local deals.
The average rise of the 41 negotiated settlements so far notified to the
federation is Pounds 5.10 a week on the craft grade but it added there had
also been 24 employer-imposed pay awards of which 13 are pay freezes.

FT  14 APR 93 / US recovery doubt as sales plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLUNGE in US retail sales last month has revived pessimism about the
strength of the country's economic recovery and sharpened President Bill
Clinton's arguments in favour of the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) spending
stimulus he has so far been unable to push through Congress.
The Commerce Department said retail sales dropped 1 per cent in March and
revised earlier estimates of February sales to a fall of 0.3 per cent,
instead of the 0.3 per cent rise originally announced.
The figures added to pressure on the dollar on the foreign exchange markets.
In London, the US currency lost ground across the board, dropping to
DM1.5790 from DM1.607 before the Easter break on Thursday. In late New York
trading, it was little changed at DM1.57935.
Some of last month's fall in sales could be attributed to the effects of
heavy snowstorms along much of the east coast, which depressed sales of
building materials, clothing and petrol.
But Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the two consecutive months of
decline provided 'compelling evidence that recovery is at risk unless
decisive action is taken when Congress returns next week'.
All sectors except drugstores showed a decline, with furniture stores down
2.3 per cent and department stores down 2.5 per cent. March sales still
stood 4.4 per cent higher than a year ago at an estimated Dollars 166.9bn,
but economists said recent surveys of consumer confidence, such as the
Conference Board indicator, have shown a much grimmer outlook for consumer
spending after a brief surge in the wake of Mr Clinton's election last
November.
The stimulus bill, which the Clinton administration claims will create
500,000 jobs, has been blocked in the Senate by a united Republican
opposition, which has denied the administration the three fifths majority it
needs to end debate and force a vote.
Mr Clinton has embarked on a campaign of harsh public criticism of the
Republicans - on Monday, pointing to 25,000 children taking part in an
Easter egg race on the White House lawn, he suggested that the young were
suffering because of the delay.
He further irritated Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader, by accusing
senators of romping in their private swimming pool on Capitol Hill while
denying funds for pools in inner cities. The administration is also trying
to win support from Republican mayors, several of whom have backed the
spending plan.

FT  14 APR 93 / Thatcher attacks Hurd on Bosnia: 'Accomplice to massacre'
accusation threatens Conservative party unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher last night launched a scathing attack on government policy
towards Bosnia, accusing the UK and other western countries of acting like
'an accomplice to a massacre'.
The former prime minister also condemned Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
of using 'terrible and disgraceful' phrases to justify not arming Bosnian
Moslems. She was 'ashamed' at the European Community's reluctance to
intervene.
Her outbursts, in a series of television interviews, provoked anger among
ministers and fractured the fragile unity within the Conservative party over
action against the Bosnian Serbs.
Last night, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs
select committee, said Baroness Thatcher's comments 'reflect almost
worldwide concern about what is happening but they go a whole lot further
and propose very much stronger measures than most people think are
necessary. But I think something has to be done. The present situation is
clearly untenable'.
Mr Patrick Cormack, Tory MP for South Staffordshire, said: 'While I don't
always agree with Baroness Thatcher I think that on this she is plumb
right.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, accused her of 'emotional nonsense'
and said arms for Bosnian Moslems 'would be used to prolong the war'. If the
west armed one side, Russia might decide to help the Serbs, he said.
Most Tory MPs have so far been reluctant to see British troops further
involved in the conflict - and Mr John Major has won a consensus within the
party for a policy based on providing humanitarian aid and urging a
negotiated peace settlement.
Conservative MPs are used to intemperate attacks on Mr Major by his
predecessor, particularly over Maastricht. But Baroness Thatcher's emotional
calls last night could rally Conservative MPs who have been horrified at
recent atrocities - including Monday's killing of at least 56 people in a
Serb artillery attack on the east Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
Tensions could erupt when the Commons returns today. Labour is pressing for
a statement on Bosnia.
Speaking on BBC television, Baroness Thatcher said: 'We can't go on with
this policy - namely feeding people but leaving them to be massacred.'
United Nations resolutions should be overturned, she said, so the Bosnian
Moslems could arm themselves: 'Everyone has a right to self-defence - that
is far older than the UN's charter.'
Mr Hurd, who was last night travelling to Japan, has previously said such a
policy would lead to 'level killing fields'. But Baroness Thatcher
responded: 'I thought it was a terrible and disgraceful phrase. There is a
killing field now where the innocent haven't the requisite arms properly to
defend themselves.'
A policy of arming Bosnian Moslems should be backed by air cover and
possibly ground attacks, she said. An alternative was to issue an ultimatum
backed by the threat of greater military intervention to the Serbs to accept
the peace plan drawn up by UN negotiators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance.

FT  14 APR 93 / NatWest in talks on link-up with two continental banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster, the UK's second largest bank, is in talks with Societe
Generale of France and Commerzbank of Germany about co-operating on
providing improved services to small businesses and personal customers.
The bank said yesterday it was exploring two possible joint initiatives:
Linking the payment systems of the three banks, so that all customers can
make cheaper transfers of funds between France, Germany and the UK.
Allowing the three banks' medium-size corporate customers to have access to
the full range of services provided by the banks.
'Talks are at a very preliminary stage,' NatWest said. No decision had been
taken on whether the banks' computer systems for funds transfers should be
connected or if any linkage should be 'less formal'.
However, plans to combine the banks' services for medium-size companies are
better developed. NatWest said the intention was that any medium-size
corporate customer of the UK bank should be able to use the services of
Commerzbank in Germany or Societe Generale in France, if that customer is
planning to do business in those countries.
Many businesses complain about the difficulty and expense of obtaining
banking services on the continent.
To date, bank initiatives to take advantage of the single European Community
market in financial services - which was created at the beginning of this
year - have been modest.
The NatWest proposal conforms with a general banking trend. Banks have been
reluctant to acquire branches in large numbers of European countries. Their
preference has been to co-operate on specific projects with other European
banks.
Last year, Royal Bank of Scotland launched an electronic system, IBOS,
linking its branches with those of Credit Commercial de France, Spain's
Banco Santander and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. IBOS
guarantees a 'same-day' transfer of funds between accounts at the member
banks.

FT  14 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does Queens Moat Houses have in common with British Steel, the best
performing stock in the FT-SE 100 during the first quarter of this year?
Both have been bought by US investors attracted by a share price at steep
discount to stated net asset value. Such a yardstick is popular in the US,
where earnings trends are volatile. At its suspension price of 47 1/2 p
Queens Moat looks cheap compared with last stated assets per share of 114p.
Yesterday's British Steel closing price of 85p was less than half the
company's net assets of 194p per share.
The Queens Moat discount has been overtaken by events, however, while there
must be room for debate about the real worth of British Steel's assets at a
time of structural overcapacity in the European industry. Perhaps price to
net assets is a better yardstick in the US because balance sheet accounting
there is more disciplined. More likely it is flawed because it takes no
account of the quality of management or its ability to generate profits from
the assets under control. Either way, the measure looks an inadequate
substitute for the price-earnings ratio which has been devalued by the new
UK accounting standards.

The 20 per cent target return on capital set by Mr Ronnie Hampel, heir to
ICI's chemicals side, is less stringent than it sounds. A five year pay-back
on new investment is close to being an industry standard. On a mixed bag of
new and fully depreciated plant, return on capital is difficult to measure.
Since ICI is shy about the distribution of capital across the group, the
market will hardly be in a position to judge whether the target has been
met. Mr Hampel could pin his colours firmly to the mast by setting a target
rate of return on sales.
If the target is applied honestly, though, ICI will be in for radical
reshaping. The chemicals side returned 3.7 per cent on net assets last year,
based on operating profits of Pounds 146m before exceptionals and
shareholders' funds of Pounds 4bn. That is some way from Mr Hampel's minimum
rate of return of 10 per cent in the trough, even allowing for restructuring
benefits to come. One answer may be for ICI to steer away from
capital-intensive industries. But that decision is by no means clear cut.
Tioxide has delivered an average return on net assets of 27 per cent over 20
years - a performance flattered by years of low investment, which depressed
the asset base and reduced depreciation.
Shorn of cash-generative pharmaceuticals, cash flow may be a bigger
constraint. Paying an uncovered, uncut dividend will cost ICI Pounds 200m
this year. The latest round of restructuring carries a cash cost of Pounds
250m over three years, on top of residual costs from earlier slimming.
Industries such as petrochemicals which feature big capital projects may
seem too risky whatever the rate of return.

The devaluation effect on UK manufacturers' costs abated in March. Not only
did input prices rise only 0.1 per cent on February's level; the main
influences were a sharp rise in home-grown food manufacturing materials
offset by a drop in the price of electricity to large industrial users. With
the prices of imported materials falling and sterling on a recovery track,
it looks as though a line can be drawn under the debate on the price effect
of devaluation. That still leaves the questions of how far the 10 per cent
rise in input prices since September will be passed on, and of how quickly
recovery will reignite inflation.
One risk is that domestic manufacturers will use recovery to catch up on the
prices charged by foreign competitors. Another is that recovery will bring
an end to discounting, pushing up retail prices as stores - rather than
manufacturers - seek to claw back margins. The chances are, though, that
such pressures will remain muted for the time being.
Recovery initially brings productivity gains as idle capacity is brought
back on stream. At this stage the impact of higher demand is thus normally
to dampen rather than kindle inflation. That should continue to offset the
higher input prices for some time, especially since the UK is also enjoying
a sharp fall in unit labour costs. The more dangerous moment will come when
pay settlements start to rise again. Despite the apparent increase in union
militancy, there is little sign of that yet. Wage levels should be watched,
just the same.

<TEXT>
The Japanese government's latest cure for its sick economy certainly spurred
the stock market. But then a Pounds 76bn package of measures could hardly
pass unnoticed, however heavily it had been trailed in advance. What remains
unclear is whether the government is administering the right medicine.
Conditions must remain tough enough to make industry sweat through some
painful restructuring, while not being so tight that companies collapse into
the black holes in their balance sheets. The measures to extend government
agency loans to small businesses and house buyers suffering in the banks'
credit squeeze work usefully toward that end. But the Y8,500bn-worth of
fiscal expansion may be feeding cream buns to a corporate sector which still
badly needs to diet.
Nor is it entirely clear that consumers will now leap enthusiastically back
into the shops, or that companies have the right capacity to respond to
government pump-priming. Japanese GNP will expand by an additional 1.5-2
percentage points this year. That, however, is entirely courtesy of the
government, and there will be an anxious wait for the reaction of the
private sector. If companies use this excuse quietly to jettison plans for
painful cuts, then the medium-term rebound in profits may be feeble,
weakening the economic recovery.
Not that the equity market is overly concerned with such niceties. A
combination of foreign buying, the prospect of huge government stock
purchases, low interest rates and the return of small investors should keep
the pot boiling. Ironically it may be the flow of foreign funds into Japan
which forces up the yen and keeps the pressure on Japanese companies to
restructure. That would validate the market's rally to heights which still
inspire vertigo in those who judge by fundamental value.

FT  14 APR 93 / Leading Article: Recoupling the through train
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS tempting yesterday, after Britain and China had put an end to months
of wrangling by announcing the imminent resumption of talks on the political
future of Hong Kong, to ask which side blinked. Was it the British or the
Chinese government that made the crucial concession on the precise role to
be played by Hong Kong officials in the talks? Or is it Mr Chris Patten,
Hong Kong's governor, who has gone the extra distance by agreeing not to
initiate the debate on his modest proposals for political reform in the
colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) while the talks continue?
Entertaining as they may be, however, these questions are irrelevant.
Yesterday's announcement is a compromise in which the parties have
side-stepped obstacles of their own creation. It was always certain that,
were talks to resume, they would take place between the two sovereign powers
in dispute, Britain and China, with Hong Kong officials playing something of
a secondary role; it was never plausible that they could happen, as China
seemed until yesterday to be demanding, with these officials barred from
seats at the negotiating table.
The resumption of dialogue is undoubtedly a welcome development for Hong
Kong - provided it gets off to a brisk and businesslike start. Without it Mr
Patten knew he was in a fragile position, facing the prospect of a difficult
LegCo debate on his proposals buffetted by threats from Beijing, and the
risk of a stand-off thereafter that might have seriously debilitated his
governorship through the last four years of British colonial rule.
By agreeing to talk, Britain and China have at least taken the essential
first step towards reconstituting the 'through train' that was supposed to
pull Hong Kong through this delicate period of transition.
Clear timetable
Yet there are also risks for Mr Patten in the new course. The most obvious
is that China, rather than engaging in a serious debate about Hong Kong's
future political structure, will see the talks as an opportunity to mount a
protracted filibuster with the aim of completely derailing Mr Patten's
plans. The timetable is not open-ended. One of the governor's proposals
affects elections to local district boards in the colony, due to take place
next year; another would mean that officials elected on that occasion would
have an important role to play in choosing members of LegCo in 1995.
This means that if a balanced package of electoral reforms is to have a
chance of coming into effect, it will have to be passed by the Legislative
Council by the autumn. If the talks starting on April 22 move slowly, or not
at all, the British and Hong Kong governments may thus again find themselves
facing a familiar dilemma later this year - whether to pull out of talks and
press ahead with reforms in the teeth of Chinese threats to set up a shadow
Hong Kong government before 1997 and to declare any changes null and void
thereafter.
LegCo's role
Talks, then, cannot be an end in themselves, or indefinite in duration.
Their value for Britain and Hong Kong will lie in seeking to ascertain what
China itself wants for the colony before and after 1997, for while Beijing
has been voluble in its denunciation of Mr Patten and all his works since
October, it has been noticeably reluctant to come forward with proposals of
its own.
If the negotiation means some amendment to the governor's reform proposals,
so be it - provided that the outcome can be debated by, and is acceptable
to, the Legislative Council. Strengthening LegCo as an autonomous
legislature is, after all, Mr Patten's clearest and most sensible objective
 -and is more important than the precise way in which he proposes to tinker
with electoral arrangements. Enhancing LegCo in this manner is also the best
test of China's sincerity in having agreed that Hong Kong should be ruled
after 1997 under the principle of 'one country, two systems'.
It remains entirely possible, of course, that China's objection is not to Mr
Patten's precise proposals, or even to the unilateral manner in which he put
them forward, but to the whole idea of having such an independent-minded
legislature in Hong Kong. If that is the case, no amount of talking will
suffice to bridge the gap.

FT  14 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Keynes and the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'PRACTICAL MEN, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any
intellectual influences,' wrote John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory,
'are usually the slave of some defunct economist.' Which academic scribbler
have Tokyo's bureaucrats been studying as they prepared Japan's second
fiscal package in less than nine months?
Certainly not the economists who advised President Clinton that a package of
tax increases and spending cuts would improve US economic performance. The
voices in the air, encouraging Japanese politicians to spend their way out
of recession, appear to come from Keynes himself, with a little
neo-Keynesian encouragement from Washington.
Not that Keynes, experienced in the ways of international finance, would
disagree with America's need for Clinton-style fiscal austerity. The high
long-term interest rates that US-style fiscal profligacy deliver have
damaging effects on economic activity.
Japan's advantage is that it used the fat years of the 1980s to build-up a
healthy fiscal surplus. By prudently avoiding placing itself in a position
in which old-style Keynesianism is counter-productive, it has been able to
run down this surplus as economic growth has slowed.
Market reactions
Japanese fiscal activism, far from frightening investors, has allowed
long-term bond rates to fall by a percentage point since the first fiscal
package was announced and remain 1 1/2 points lower than in America. The
combination of the latest Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) fiscal package and a
recent government-managed revival of animal spirits, has lifted the Tokyo
stock market through the 20,000 barrier, closing 44 per cent above last
August's low, while the the yen has risen to a record high against the
dollar.
The announcement yesterday was also an impressive propaganda coup. By
announcing the package on the eve of a summit of the world's leading finance
ministers in Tokyo, the government secured the public praise of US Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, despite yesterday's news that Japan's trade surplus
rose to Dollars 111bn (Pounds 73bn) in the 1992 fiscal year.
But will it work? In the short-term, Japan's fiscal activism cannot fail to
boost economic growth. The package, adjusted for the various dodges and
leakages which enrage zealous US officials, will inject around Y8,500bn
(Pounds 49bn) worth of new spending into the economy this fiscal year,
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of Japanese gross national product. The Economic
Planning Agency confidently expects the spending, mainly on infrastructure,
to push GNP growth above 3 per cent this fiscal year.
Private investment
Yet fiscal expansion on such a scale cannot replace private spending and
investment for long without leading to structural fiscal problems.
Worryingly, the prospects of a marked revival in private-sector activity
look poor, despite modest signs of an upturn in housing starts, car sales
and broad money supply.
Retail sales to nervous consumers are still falling and companies say they
plan to cut investment spending again this year. The appreciation in the
value of the yen, which fiscal expansion and the revival in the stock market
are already helping to deliver, will further postpone a revival in Japanese
industrial activity. In the short term, it will also make the trade surplus
larger as yen import prices fall.
Even if investment demand picks up, it will take years rather than months
before Japan's debt-burdened banks are able to support a recovery in private
investment. The revival in the stock market, and widening of interest
margins, have eased the prudential pressures on the banks. But the yield
curve remains flat, suggesting a further cut in short-term interest rates is
overdue, while bad debts are being written off at a sluggish pace.
In short, the revival in consumer demand for US imports and a fall in the
trade surplus look many months away. The spirit of Keynes lives on in Tokyo.
But, for all Japan's far-sighted prudence and political guile, modern-day
pump-priming looks unlikely to produce quickly what the Japanese need and
the US wants.

FT  14 APR 93 / An Italian empire strikes back: ENI, the state energy group,
is restructuring and breaking political ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few jobs more daunting than the one facing Mr Franco Bernabe,
chief executive of ENI, Italy's state energy concern and the world's eighth
largest oil group.
The 44-year-old economist must pick up the pieces of an industrial empire
stricken by involvement in corruption investigations and prepare its
businesses for privatisation.
His efforts are being watched closely from abroad. Potential investors will
scrutinise his attempts to reshape the diverse group. Foreign governments
will keep an equally close eye on emerging evidence of fraud in ENI's
overseas operations.
It is at home, however, that the group's affairs have caused most
disruption. ENI has emerged as one of the principal paymasters in an
elaborate system of graft that has sustained Italy's main political parties
for two decades. Its affairs have caused the resignation of two ministers in
less than two months and contributed to the enforced departure of Mr Bettino
Craxi from the leadership of the Socialist party.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, resigned on March 9 after being
arrested on charges of alleged corruption and falsifying accounts. The heads
of four leading ENI subsidiaries - Agip (oil and gas exploration), Snam (gas
supplies), Saipem (drilling) and Nuovo Pignone (turbines) - have also been
arrested on similar charges. All are now helping magistrates unravel a
darker side of what has been the most dynamic group in Italy's unwieldy
public sector.
In the midst of this storm, Mr Bernabe has remained calm. 'Although very
much alone, he knows what he wants and has had strong support from the
government,' observes one colleague. 'Now that Cagliari's gone and the
political parties are too discredited to interfere, he is much freer.'
His position has been reinforced by the appointment on March 31 of a new
five-man board, composed of technocrats and oil industry experts. But he has
enemies from within the political establishment who oppose his plans to
shake up ENI, concentrate on core businesses and carry out extensive
privatisation. 'Bernabe sees privatisation essentially as a means of
reducing the capacity of the state to interfere in corporate management,'
observes a senior ENI executive. ENI is the second largest state group with
annual sales of over L50,000bn (Pounds 20.8bn) and 130,000 employees
worldwide.
Many politicians are reluctant to lose this source of patronage. Last June,
'old guard' politicians from the Christian Democratic and Socialist parties
tried to get Mr Bernabe sacked. The move backfired, and when ENI was
converted into a joint stock company in August, Mr Cagliari, the
representative of these politicians, was forced into a nominal chairman's
role.
This marked the first stage in removing ENI from the direct political arena.
Ever since the group was founded by Enrico Mattei in 1953 following
significant gas discoveries in the Po Valley, it has played a high-profile
political role. The drive to establish independent sources of oil supplies
gave Mattei powerful influence, particularly in foreign policy.
'I treat the political parties like taxis - I get on and off them when I
feel like,' is an often quoted Mattei dictum. A power unto himself, he took
ENI in a number of diverse directions including newspaper ownership (ENI
still owns the daily Il Giorno). But he also made ENI's logo of the
fire-breathing dog with six legs the symbol of Italy's postwar development
and prosperity.
After Mattei's death 1962, the politicians gradually reduced the group's
independence. First it was the turn of the Christian Democrats, then the
Socialists who in the late 1970s staked out ENI as their area of patronage.
Once Mr Craxi, the Socialist leader, became prime minister in 1983, he
established a chain of officials to aid ENI operations. From Italian
embassies abroad to pliant state-controlled banks, ENI received favoured
treatment. In return, the party received political funds. The confessions of
ENI executives and consultants in the past two months point to the group
being one of the most important sources of illicit finance to Italy's
political parties during the 1980s.
Among the many accusations now being levelled by Milan magistrates against
Mr Craxi is that during the late 1980s he allegedly received or was party to
organising illicit funds of about L12bn from ENI, L8bn from Snam, L4bn from
Agip, L3.5bn from Saipem and L4bn from Nuovo Pignone.
Milan magistrates are pursuing five main areas of investigation:
the reorganisation of the petrochemicals and chemicals industry through
Enimont, the joint venture set up in 1989 with Ferruzzi Montedison and
bought by ENI in 1990;
domestic contracts won by ENI subsidiaries, notably in the energy sector;
kickbacks on foreign contracts won by Saipem and Snam. These include
pipelines in Nigeria and Iraq, and gas supplies from Algeria and the Soviet
Union;
the fate of Dollars 7m paid in 1982 to the Socialists by disgraced banker
Roberto Calvi in return for ENI lending money to Banco Ambrosiano, the
private bank which collapsed in 1982 and had to be rescued by Italian
financial institutions.
funds generated by ENI offshore subsidiaries through false consultancy
contracts, and through trading in oil contracts and currencies.
This is a big dossier with far-reaching implications. Take the Enimont
affair. Magistrates are working on the assumption that ENI was pressed by
its political masters in the Socialist and Christian Democrat-dominated
coalition to buy out Ferruzzi Montedison's 40 per cent stake in Enimont for
an inflated price of L2,805bn. But they have so far failed to prove there
was any political pay-off from the transactions and Ferruzzi denies any
wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the cost of this purchase and the subsequent
losses of the fertilisers sector have been one of the main factors
restraining ENI's profits.
The state's investigations are also revealing the extent of the group's
overseas operations in directing funds to the political establishment.
According to the investigators, revenues were diverted through subsidiaries
in offshore tax havens or Switzerland, frequently using former ENI
executives and their cronies. Foreign subsidiaries also passed on the
profits of speculative trading in oil and currencies.
ENI executives have admitted that 'commissions' were frequently paid for
overseas contracts. This was also confirmed in a recent interview by Mr
Franco Reviglio, who was forced to resign as Italy's finance minister last
month because of his alleged role in permitting ENI funds to be diverted to
political parties while chairman of the group between 1983 and 1989.
In an interview in La Repubblica, one of Italy's leading newspapers, he
said: 'Unfortunately this (granting of commissions) was something
unavoidable if you wanted to deal with certain countries. . . . Our main
concern was to ensure that these bribes did not find their way back to Italy
to finance people, movements and institutions.'
In Italy the paying of 'commissions' to secure a contract abroad is not an
offence provided the company's books are not falsified. This grey area of
legality has enabled the parties to obtain illicit funds by taking a cut on
inflated foreign 'commissions'. All of the 11 ENI executives involved in the
corruption scandals are charged with falsifying accounts.
So far the magistrates appear to have decided to avoid embarrassing foreign
governments - and prejudicing Italian contracts overseas - by not releasing
the names of foreign nationals. But already the Algerian government has
asked the Italian government for information about large gas sales contracts
with ENI in the 1980s for which it fears bribes may have been paid.
In the wake of Mr Cagliari's resignation, Mr Bernabe set up a special
working committee to examine management methods in ENI's overseas
operations. By the beginning of June it will present proposals for
tightening controls on the overseas activities of subsidiaries, especially
those with purely financial functions. Already 30 overseas companies have
been closed.
In addition to cleansing its organisation, the group faces a difficult
challenge in restoring its credibility and defining its future shape. 'ENI
has become too big to keep track of with 209 subsidiaries overseas,' says
one executive.
Agip Petroli, the oil distribution arm, and the EniChem chemicals business
have 60 companies based outside Italy, while another 30 are registered
abroad by Agip. Bringing this far-flung empire to account is essential, says
the company. The shake-up is already underway. Amsterdam-based ENI
International Holding, which controls ENI International Bank, a financial
institution registered in Nassau and operating out of Montecarlo, and which
handles financial transactions exclusively for the group, has been one of
the first targets. Last week, its 16-member board was removed and replaced
by a 5-man team.
Mr Bernabe's efforts to reorganise the group will have a marked impact on
ENI's financial performance. The results for 1992, as yet unpublished, will
reflect the heavy cost of measures already taken to simplify the group's
structure, purge loss-makers and sell off parts of the business. ENI
officials concede that additional heavy provisions will be necessary.
About L500bn will be set aside in both the 1992 and 1993 accounts to cover
redundancies at subsidiaries such as the group's heavily loss-making
Sardinian lead and zinc mines. Job losses have already been felt in the
higher echelons of the ENI organisation, with about 250 boardroom posts
having been cut as a result of the closures so far. Heavy provisions will
also be required to cover one-off write-downs in the value of fixed
investments at some subsidiaries being closed or sold.
Together these provisions will depress earnings for the group, which made
L1,081bn after tax in 1991. As a result, ENI is unlikely to meet the
government's prediction in its 'green book' on planned privatisations that
pre-tax earnings for 1992 will be in line with those of the previous year.
The need to set money aside to cover special provisions may even require
some of the proceeds from privatisation to go to ENI, rather than directly
to the Treasury, as envisaged by the government's privatisation plans.
Mr Bernabe has already managed to sell some of the group's non-core assets
and hopes to raise further cash by floating other operations on the stock
market. Last month, he announced the disposal of two parts of the Savio
textile machinery division, raising about L150bn. The remaining units of the
division may be sold by the end of this year. Plans to sell the profitable
Agip Coal business, which has operations from Australia to South America,
are well advanced. In all, 25 significant disposals are now under way.
Sales of group assets are open to foreign investors. So, too, will be the
next stage of restructuring and refinancing the group - the flotation of its
principal subsidiaries.
The process is expected to start with Agip, one of the most profitable parts
of ENI. Details are not yet available, but analysts expect up to 20 per cent
of the shares will be listed, raising about L2,000bn. If the Agip deal goes
successfully, Snam may be next. 'Taking the subsidiaries public is not just
a way of raising money, but will also show bankers and potential investors
we are serious about being judged by the market,' says a member of the
privatisation team.
The transactions will be the prelude to floating ENI itself. Listing the
parent company will be much more complicated than taking the subsidiaries
public. Merchant bankers have been working on the Agip and Snam flotations
for over two years; it will take them at least as long to do valuations and
prepare ENI's accounts for a share issue.
During this period ENI will continue its struggle towards a new identity.
The cleansing process has begun and there is a sense of liberation within
the group, a result of its increasing freedom from political control. But
there is much dirty linen still to emerge, and the road to privatisation
will not be easy.

Regular readers of this column will be aware that good jokes are in short
supply. So Observer has no hesitation in recycling the following quip from
yesterday's Daily Mail.
Pub customer: 'I'd like half a pint of your best bitter in a pint glass,
topped up with a dash of Dom Perignon, three shots of Jack Daniels, two
shots of vodka and a couple of cherries.'
Without raising a well-trained eyebrow the barman mixed the drink and
watched the concoction go down in one. 'I shouldn't have had that with what
I've got,' gasped the customer.
'And what have you got sir?' asked the alarmed barman. 'Thirty seven pence,'
replied the bounder.

Watch out for fireworks as one of the world's odder bilateral partnerships
comes up for inspection next month. Australia's tough-talking prime minister
Paul Keating, fresh from his victory at the polls, is paying his first
official visit on Jim Bolger, his New Zealand counterpart.
Don't be deceived into thinking that everything is hunky dory just because
trade between the two ex-British colonies is booming. There are plenty of
tensions behind the scenes.
Australians, for example, have never forgiven New Zealanders for refusing to
join their fledgling federation in 1900, and many still don't understand why
Kiwis don't want to have their affairs run from Canberra, a thousand miles
away across the Tasman Sea. Ministers who would not dream of insulting Papua
New Guinea or Fiji, find it hard to be polite about their Kiwi cousins.
The problem was at its worst in the run-up to last month's Australian
election. Not only did Keating's Labor government paint conservative-run NZ
as an economic basket case, ignoring growing signs of sustainable recovery,
but senior Labor figures also lent weight to dubious claims that Kiwi sheep
shearers were cheating on their Australian income tax returns. Whatever
next?
Bolger, a taciturn North Island beef farmer, is not likely to upbraid
Keating in public for his government's insensitivity. But he may feel free
to point to another big difference - unlike the staunchly republican
Keating, the vast majority of New Zealanders remain firmly attached to the
monarchy. He might also have some diplomatic tips. European diplomats say
the Kiwis' subtle approach has won them much better trade concessions than
those obtained by the rougher Aussies.

<TEXT>
Jack Welch, the GE boss, doesn't like being reminded that the acquisition of
the NBC TV network was hardly his company's most astute move. So his sudden
appearance inside his TV fiefdom on Monday had a dramatic impact.
His avowed purpose was to introduce the new president of NBC News, Andrew
Lack, poached from rival CBS. The appointment follows the embarrassing row
over an NBC programme which involved a well known make of pick-up truck
rigged to catch fire after it crashed.
The mighty Welch was in a forgiving mood as he addressed the staff of a
network which has been stuck in third place and long rumoured to be up for
sale. Everybody has lapses in judgment, said Welch, but that was now all in
the past.
'The good news is that GE likes NBC. NBC is not for sale. GE wants to be
part of NBC,' said the great man, before joking: 'I guess some of you might
feel that's bad news, but I hope not.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Observer: Mandarin syndrome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether it was the Chinese or the British who blinked first in the tortuous
business of arranging talks about talks on the future of Hong Kong, the
mandarins at the Foreign Office made quite sure that Chris Patten could not
claim too much of the credit.
The announcement coincided with a London news conference given by the
governor of Hong Kong. But a telephone call to the FO's well-staffed news
department asking for the time and location of the event hit a brick wall.
Even though the event was taking place at the FO a well-spoken young lady in
the news department told callers that everyone was busy in an internal
briefing. She could give no details of any encounter between Patten and the
press. The media should call back later.
By the time the department's own meeting was over, so too was Patten's press
conference. Perhaps, after all, the friends of Beijing still hold sway among
the mandarins of King Charles Street.

FT  14 APR 93 / Foes with shared values: Misleading myths divide Islamic and
western states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Hereticks, and take from
them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word; and so
fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among
the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one shepherd,
Jesus Christ our Lord . . .'
One no longer hears that collect read in Anglican churches on Good Friday,
as one used to when I was a schoolboy. At some point, well before the phrase
'politically correct' became current, it was quietly dropped. The words
might be construed as offensive to the categories of people mentioned: Jews,
Moslems, atheists and Christians of other denominations. And since the
Church of England does not wish to cause offence, it altered its liturgy.
Of course, if you really believe - as the author of the collect presumably
did - that people who do not share your religious beliefs are missing their
only chance of eternal bliss, you should pray for their conversion whether
it offends them or not. But few Anglicans nowadays do believe that. Even the
Pope, I suspect, no longer insists absolutely on the doctrine of extra
ecclesia nulla salus (no salvation outside the church). He seems to regard
other religions, especially monotheistic ones, less as competitors than as
potential allies of Christianity in the great battle between God and mammon.
Britain's Chief Rabbi, Dr Jonathan Sacks, shares that view. In his 1990
Reith Lectures he urged religious minorities to support the established
church, it being the only national institution capable of giving a religious
dimension to Britain's public culture. The argument is quoted with approval
by a Moslem scholar, Tariq Modood, in one of the thoughtful essays published
last year under the title Not Easy Being British (Runnymede Trust and
Trentham Books, Pounds 7.95). Modood is anxious to head off an attempt by
secularists to use the supposed sensitivity of non-Christian minorities to
advance the cause of disestablishment - something which, he says, has not
been demanded by any minority faith organisation.
Moslems found much more understanding for their campaign against Salman
Rushdie's Satanic Verses among the Christian clergy than they did in the
secular intelligentsia. That may seem surprising. In earlier ages Christian
writers depicted Islam as a vicious and fanatical heresy, and it was
anticlerical liberals who first painted a different picture, of a civilised
Islam, which they contrasted with the reactionary obscurantism of the
Catholic establishment at home.
Now the boot is on the other foot. Islam is again seen as a threat to
established western values, but those values have become more liberal than
Christian, and some Christians see Islam as a possible ally in an effort to
stem the tide of liberal triumphalism.
Is there in fact an irreconcilable conflict between Islam and western
values? Many on both sides would say yes. Many Moslems see the west as
completely godless and amoral, dominated by crime and pornography at home,
brutal and arrogant in its behaviour towards the rest of the world, and
nursing a special animus against them, the Moslems. From Bombay to Bosnia,
passing by Iraq and Palestine, Moslems see themselves as victims, with 'the
west' always directly or indirectly the aggressor. In his powerful TV
series, Living Islam, starting tonight on BBC2, and in the accompanying book
(BBC Books, Pounds 15.99), the Pakistani anthropologist Akbar Ahmed even
called the war in Bosnia the 'last crusade'.
Similarly, many in the west see Islam as irredeemably violent and
repressive. Neither side has any difficulty in finding evidence to support
its view, and of course each is reinforced by the other.
But both 'Islam' and the 'west' can be regarded either as ideals or as
civilisations. If we think of them as ideals, we may have difficulty in
defining them precisely because so many different people identify with them
in each case and there is such a variety of interpretations on offer.
Clearly they are not identical: the west puts more emphasis on the value of
each individual human being, while Islam insists on the centrality of God.
But there is a considerable overlap in the core values that both proclaim:
peace, justice, compassion, tolerance; even equality and the use of reason
to acquire knowledge.
If we think of them as civilisations we are confronted with even greater
diversity on both sides. They are composed of millions of human beings,
nearly all of whom fall short in practice of the ideals they claim to
believe in; and here too there is an increasing overlap. Not only do some
10m Moslems live in the west; equally significant is the presence of so many
aspects of western civilisation within Moslem countries.
More than anything it is the impossibility of making a complete break with
the west that drives some Moslems to desperation. They may succeed in
defining an 'Islam' that is completely antithetical to the west, but their
chances of imposing it durably on any part of the Moslem world are virtually
zero. Revolutionary Iran and conservative Saudi Arabia alike are driven all
the time to make compromises, though in very different ways.
The Moslems' extremist myth of a monolithic and malign west is as futile and
misleading as the view, current in some western circles, that a monolithic,
malign Islam has replaced communism as our most dangerous enemy. This indeed
is the main point of Prof Ahmed's series; as an articulate Moslem living in
the west, he hopes to persuade both sides to see good as well as bad in each
other.

FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Technically superior economic model - but of little
benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WYNNE GODLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to Jeremy Bray (Letters, April 7), 'Despite ill-informed
press criticism, economic modelling practices in the UK are in most respects
technically well ahead of those in the US' - the result, apparently, of the
'econometric methods developed by Prof David Hendry'.
Ahead of the US or not, Prof Hendry's technical advances have not resulted
in any detectable improvement in the ability of the large-scale models
developed under this influence to make accurate forecasts. Nor has there
been any increase, flowing from best practice econometrics, in the
understanding of how modern industrial economies function as systems. So
what, usefully, can it mean to say we are 'technically well ahead' of the
US?
In my view, adverse press comment on the performance of the relevant models
(not only the Treasury's model, but those of the London Business School and
the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) has not been
'ill-informed' at all. It has been fully justified by the deplorable, and
extremely damaging, way in which public discussion, not to mention
governments, have been misled by these monsters.

FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: UK must learn a lesson from European partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DENIS MACSHANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Labour and industry' (April 7), stressed the
importance of institutional relationships (labour-management relations, pay,
etc) inside companies instead of technological quick-fixes.
The politics of free collective bargaining practised through the 1980s
bumped up labour costs in Britain far above its competitors'. The increases
in productivity brought about by mass redundancies (2.3m manufacturing jobs
disappeared between 1980 and 1990) could not compensate.
You refer to the 'miracle companies of the east' but one of the most
striking aspects of their pay relations is the much smaller ratio between
salaries paid to workers and to top executives. In Britain, this gap has
widened significantly, is widening and must diminish before the more
harmonious workplace you rightly identify as the key to success can come
into being. Perhaps, instead of a statutory minimum wage, Labour should
propose a statutory maximum one.
I also question the endless reference to Asia. Surely there are plenty of
European examples of countries which manage their affairs better than
Britain. Small ones such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland have
better records in industrial output, trade and so on. And despite horrendous
difficulties occasioned by unification or political stasis, the economic
records of Germany and France are far better over the past decade than the
UK's.
Institutional relationships in both countries play their part. The new
French government has just called in the unions to discuss economic
questions while the workers on the board of Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen are
working constructively with managers to re-shape the companies.
It was sad, therefore, to read the predictable 1980s response of the
Confederation of British Industry to Labour's worker directors proposal. At
least they merit reasoned discussion. The CBI should try to learn from what
works in other countries.

FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Vance-Owen plan must be adjusted to achieve greater
equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE TINTOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For the second time in a year, the US and the European Community are
attempting to impose their will on Bosnia's 1.5m Serbs. A year ago, the
'independence' of Bosnia was recognised by the west despite the objections
of the Bosnian Serbs. The Serbs, who constitute a third of Bosnia's
population and inhabit 60 per cent of its territory, opposed independence
prior to an agreement on constitutional principles.
Predictably, the Bosnian Serbs took up arms to resist being forcibly
incorporated in an inherently hostile state. The consequences of their
rebellion have been dreadful.
Today, the West is attempting to force the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
Vance-Owen plan. Although the Vance-Owen plan goes a long way toward
recognising the rights of all three Bosnian groups, including the Bosnian
Serbs, it stops short of an equitable and lasting solution. The Vance-Owen
plan divides Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous regions dominated by either
Bosnia's Croats, Moslems or Serbs.
The Bosnian Croats accept the Vance-Owen plan without reservation because it
gives them far more territory than they could have possibly expected. The
Bosnian Moslems reluctantly accept the plan because, at present, it
represents the best prospect for foreign military intervention. The cost to
the Moslems, however, is the abandonment of their goal of a unitary state.
The Bosnian Serbs object to the Vance-Owen plan on two points. First, the
map leaves large numbers of Serbs in areas dominated by Moslems and Croats;
and second, it denies the Serbs a land corridor between the large
Serb-inhabited region in north-western Bosnia and Serbia itself. Given the
present animosity between the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats and
Moslems, an isolated Serb region in Bosnia would become the Nagorno-Karabakh
of Europe. It is inconceivable that the Serbs will voluntarily accept this
arrangement.
Adjustments must be made to the Vance-Owen plan to ensure that it is fair to
all three Bosnian groups. Otherwise, the country will be condemned to
decades of misery.

FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Another Islamic bank in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES HIGGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Gapper's article 'UK acts against Islamic bank' (April 1) begins:
'London-based Albaraka International Bank, the only Islamic bank in Europe.
. .' In fact there is in Copenhagen an entirely separate bank run on Islamic
principles - the A/S Islamic Bank International of Denmark - which I was
visiting just last month.

FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: French without tears - Opera in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The days when French singers were deemed necessary for French opera are long
past. We want to hear the repertory, but there are no longer enough good
native singers to go round. One solution is to sing in the vernacular, but
this destroys the unique tonal blend of word and vocal line in French music.
Another is to find non-French singers who have mastered the subtleties of
the language - as in the latest Geneva staging of Poulenc's Dialogues des
Carmelites. Or you engage a stock international cast who muddle their way
through as best as possible, as Zurich has just done for Massenet's
Herodiade.
Switzerland's linguistic mix means that audiences never have trouble
understanding French when it is intelligently sung. But finding the right
singers is no easier than elsewhere. This puts a premium on the artistic
judgment and casting skills of theatres, qualities for which Geneva's Grand
Theatre has become justly renowned. Recent seasons have included Louise,
Ariane et Barbe-bleue, Mireille and Benvenuto Cellini, all with Anglophone
principal singers. Now comes Poulenc's Christian tragedy - with Felicity
Palmer, Marie McLaughlin and Alison Hagley as the three nuns whose words
count the most.
They did themselves proud, and in the case of Miss Palmer's Old Prioress
outstandingly so - not just in her fearless French declamation, but in her
very human portrait of a woman whose redoubtable exterior crumbles before
the agony of death. As Constance, Miss Hagley was spontaneous and
child-like, a perfect foil for Blanche as portrayed by Miss McLaughlin: a
troubled spirit searching for inner peace, sung and acted with quiet
intensity. In the same way, Martine Dupuy's obsessive Mere Marie was the
alter ego of Valerie Millot's fragrant, pragmatic Madame Lidoine.
This is an opera of opposites, all of them underlined in Francois Rochaix's
staging. Robert Dahlstrom's representational decor allowed each scene to
dovetail into the next. Here was the turmoil of Paris next to the solace of
Compiegne, revolutionary hysteria face-to-face with religious order, mundane
chatter amid a world of prayer. This most Catholic of operas made strong
theatrical sense - never more so than when the nuns mounted the scaffold
one-by-one in the final scene. And it would be hard to imagine Poulenc's
serene, unspectacular music sounding more heartfelt than in the hands of
Michel Plasson and the Suisse Romande Orchestra.
On these terms, the charge of longwindedness is hard to sustain. The
criticism might be better targeted at Herodiade, judging by the Zurich Opera
House's belated 150th anniversary tribute to Massenet. This grand operatic
treatment of the Salome story has survived on the fringe of the repertory as
a vehicle for star singers. What it really needs is a trenchant modern
staging.
Zurich built this revival around Jose Carreras and Grace Bumbry, but
Carreras cancelled, causing renewed worries about his health. Miss Bumbry,
pro that she is, struggled valiantly to give the show some credibility. The
odds were against her. Carreras' replacement as John the Baptist was Boiko
Zvetanov, a young Bulgarian with a sweet voice, who sang with little
dramatic purpose in a mush of vowel sounds. The virginal Salome was Cecilia
Gasdia, who was similarly uninvolving, despite her touching delivery of the
first act aria 'Il est doux'. As Herod, the American lyric baritone Rodney
Gilfry enunciated well, but seemed temperamentally at odds with such a
mature part. More convincing were Laszlo Polgar's Phanuel and the orchestra
under Manfred Honeck, who made the most of Massenet's fund of lush melodies.
No expense had been spared on Gian-Franco de Bosio's staging, a fancy dress
parade framed by arched columns and regularly interrupted by a quaint
pictorial drop-curtain (designed by Pasquale Grossi). It was money down the
drain. The chorus looked as if they were rehearsing for Verona. The ballets
ranged from elementary acrobatics to a crotch-dance by a pretty boy in a
loin cloth. To describe this as kitsch would be too generous.

There will, I imagine, be cheering as today's Dispatches goes out (9.00 C4).
It reports on small businessmen who live in fear of the Inland Revenue and
recounts stories of intimidation by tax inspectors. One former tax man
asserts 'Most inspectors believe that all small traders are fiddling'. There
are horrific tales of a couple who had to pay their life savings to the
Revenue, and of a publican who died after being pursued by inspectors over
profits he could never have made. Tomorrow's World screens a report from
Paris featuring rental schemes for electric cars, a system for superimposing
different adverts on billboards, and computerisation of the organ in Notre
Dame (7.30 BBC1). QED seeks to show what will be the effects of the next
Tokyo earthquake; the last was 70 years ago and the next is now due. This
time, owing to Tokyo's key position in the world economy, the effects may be
international (9.35 BBC1). BBC2 begins a six-part series which has been
causing difficulties before even reaching the screen: Living Islam. It
attempts to demystify the religion (8.10).
