FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: Stunned by a mighty Pine - Jazz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Those people at the Jazz Cafe in London whose last experience of jazz
saxophonist Courtney Pine was his 1992 disc To the eyes of creation must
have stumbled into the Camden night feeling dazed and confused last week,
not to mention a little deaf. Leading an acoustic group which included South
African Bheki Mseleku at the keyboard, the young tenorist - he is 29 - left
his similarly young audience with the look of a colony of rabbits caught in
the headlights of an oncoming juggernaut. Although the tunes were taken from
the album, an easy and persuasive mix of reggae and soul-washed modern jazz,
they were delivered with such fierce and sometimes brutal fervour, it seemed
that Pine might be exorcising their memory.
'Healing Song', a bright and easy opener for the album was started
caustically by Pine before he was even in sight. By the time he had reached
the stand, striding around the upper gallery, drummer Mark Mondesir had
established a polyrhythmic barrage of sound down below and the tenorist's
sonic attack was under way. 'Country Dance', another ostensibly beguiling
tune, exploded into an extraordinary and somewhat two-dimensional assault
with drummer Mondesir all but suffocating Wayne Batchelor's string bass,
Mseleku's piano and Cameron Pierre's acoustic guitar.
Respite from Pine's abstract soprano scribbling and curtain of tenor
modality finally came with the hymnal 'Psalm', a traditional song
beautifully arranged by the leader. Bheki Mseleku unfolded the irresistible
melody, though the sound quality did him no favours and Mondesir held off
for a while. The reprieve was short-lived, however, and Pine returned to
purge the melody with a display of circular breathing at the soprano which
only just failed to find the resonant frequency of the bar's cocktail
glasses.
One after another, seemingly innocent tunes were dragged by Pine and
Mondesir into a harsh and free environment to be wrung of all their
sweetness.
The night was not entirely filled with reed abuse, however, and further rest
periods were provided by the appearance of Talvin Singh whose reverberating
tablas led Pine's soprano in a cheeky duet. Mseleku tried his hand again
with a cut from his own album 'Celebration' but the sound from the keyboard
had not improved and the eager 'township' contagion was all but lost.
This sort of display of firepower and technical brilliance gone haywire is
not to everyone's taste of course, but in Pine's hands it does have a
curiously purging effect on the senses. When it comes out of a composing and
organisational talent as fresh as his, it is exhilarating.

FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: Deserved encore by a master myth-maker - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
ASTONISHINGLY, Edgar Reitz has done it again. In April 1986, BBC2 brought us
his 11-part series Heimat, one of the few real masterpieces of television
fiction. With Maria Simon as its central character, it told the story of the
inhabitants of Schabbach, a village in the Hunsruck area of Germany, between
1919 and 1982. In the process it conveyed the story of the German people
during much of the 20th century, particularly around the period of the
second world war.
BBC2 has just finished repeating the whole, entrancing saga. So deeply
involved in the lives of these characters do we become - in the minutiae
which vividly illustrate the greater historical events of the time - that
the end of the series brings an acute sense of deprivation similar to that
caused by reading the last page of War And Peace.
But happily this coming Saturday evening BBC2 begins screening The Second
Heimat: A New Generation and it seems that Reitz has not only not lost his
touch but, if anything, refined and improved it. This conclusion is based
upon previewing only six hours of the new work - 'only' seeming the right
word when you realise that Part 2 is even longer than the original: 13
episodes of two hours. But such is the magic of Heimat I would happily have
sat through the other 20 hours, had the BBC not been still working on the
sub-titling. Ironically, in that it is the only aspect not under Reitz's
control, the sub-titling is the one technical detail which is less than
satisfactory: instead of modern white-on-black, the BBC has gone back to the
inferior white-only which is so hard to read against pale backgrounds.
At the centre of Heimat 2 is Hermann Simon, Maria's youngest son, whose
passionate love affair with the older Klarchen was so cruelly destroyed by
the family in Part 1. The date is now 1960 and the setting has changed from
country to city, with Hermann, played by a splendid young actor named Henry
Arnold, arriving in Munich to begin studying music. He becomes one of a
group of young intellectuals who congregate in a large middle class house
made available to them by an older woman who enjoys the company of young
artists. At least for the first three episodes the development of modern
music is one of the main backdrops against which the human relationships are
enacted, and presumably this continues throughout.
It is not merely a matter of using music as a pretty accompaniment (much of
what we hear seems to me far from pretty, though Reitz does more to endear
avant garde music to me than anyone else ever has) nor of exploiting music
and musicians for the sake of angst-ridden drama as in such Hollywood
horrors as Song Without End. Reitz works the music into the very lives of
his characters, and makes the difference between the new music and the old
one of the keys to the differences between the generations.
Some have said that Heimat is merely up-market soap opera; can anybody
conceive of a theme such as this in EastEnders? The main difference between
Maria's generation and Hermann's is, of course, the experience of Nazism and
here Reitz has done more, perhaps, than anyone else in the field of popular
culture to deal honestly with post-war attitudes. That means neither
atavistic arrogance nor the perpetual wringing of hands among his older
characters, nor does it mean endless guilt and tearful rejection among the
young. Mostly it means obfuscation, subtle misunderstanding, and a tendency
for immediate events to distract from the enormity of what was done . . . as
during the war itself, according to Heimat 1. There is a wonderful moment in
Episode 2 of the new series when Angelika and her friends are playing
Vivaldi at a birthday party and her wealthy bourgeois father slips off to
play with his radio-controlled boat in the swimming pool. It encapsulates a
powerful Reitz cocktail of social, political and artistic attitudes.
Reitz repeatedly makes clear his love of cinema. The sub-text involving the
development of stills cameras in Heimat 1 moves on to the development of
movie cameras in Heimat 2: Hermann's friends use an Arriflex, the camera
which was originally developed for the Wehrmacht. In Episode 3 Reitz inserts
a nice joke for cineastes when one of the students says 'We've just been to
a film you must see: La Notte by Antonioni. You come out feeling like
shooting yourself]' which is spot on for period and also true.
But whatever Reitz's own predilections surely neither of these huge works
would ever have been made for cinema alone, nor even have been conceived
without the model provided by television serial drama. A few people might be
willing to devote the money and time necessary to watch 26 hours of material
in a cinema, but only a few. Millions in umpteen countries watched Heimat 1
on television, and probably millions more in even more places will watch
Heimat 2. Such was the critical and popular success of Part 1 that there are
16 co-producers for Part 2, six German and 10 foreign, nearly all of them
television companies, including the BBC.
However, saying that Heimat is a true product of the television serial
tradition is not the same as saying that it is just high class soap opera.
It certainly has some of the characteristics of soap opera: a big cast,
considerable time devoted to the dramatisation of the everyday, and that
extraordinarily powerful ability to make a set of fictional characters so
attractive to the viewers that they simply want it to go on and on, feeling
that the drama has become a part of their own lives.
You can hardly miss the fact that Reitz has a marvellous aptitude for
narrative, and that he loves sex and music as well as cinema: the tastes of
a sane and admirable individual. But the similarity between his work and TV
soap is really no greater than that between Madam Bovary and the latest
Mills &amp; Boon romance which, you may say, are both novels, but that does not
tell us very much. Claiming that EastEnders and Heimat are both soap operas
tells us as little.
Reitz - writer, director, and producer of this vast epic - who was never
exactly fumbling around in Part 1, seems even more technically assured in
Part 2. Each episode now revolves around one of the friends or acquaintances
of the central character. As before, the first person singular voice-over is
used to powerful effect (as it was in Brideshead Revisited; why do so many
television dramatists overlook this unique route into a character's interior
life?) and Reitz is now completely relaxed about switching from one
first-person voice-over to another, even within one episode. In theory it
should be confusing yet it is not.
While makers of British television serial drama are besotted with the look
of their period trappings (vintage cars, enamel advertisement hoardings, the
precise details of Sylvia's underwear in Lipstick On Your Collar) Reitz can
be quite casual about such things. In the first scene of passion between
Hermann and Clarissa she is revealed to be wearing tights . . . in 1961?
About five years too early, surely. Reitz is far more concerned with the
effect of the whole image on the screen. He habitually uses monochrome for
daytime and colour for night, a scheme which works much better than the
arbitrary switching in Heimat 1. His pictures are often beautiful, and even
though Heimat 1 and 2 are products of the television age he shoots as a
cinema director. There is a continuous hand-held travelling shot across a
river in a snow-covered park, following a conversation between Hermann and
Juan in Episode 2 which lasts 1 minute 43 seconds. No television director
would dare.
Yet whatever the pleasures in technique, sub-texts, social observation, and
historical analysis, what matters above all in the end is the narrative
factor. Reitz uses 1993 technology, but he is really the story teller beside
the fire at the mouth of the cave, surrounded by a rapt audience whispering
'What happened next?'

FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: A powerful experience way down South - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From The Mississippi Delta at the Cochrane Theatre is a partly
autobiographical play about the Deep South written by Endesha Ida Mae
Holland. In America, the play opened in Buffalo and New York, and in England
at the Young Vic (1989). This Talawa Theatre production makes powerful,
high-energy theatre: fine acting in a bare set, with no props.
The central characters, shared by the three actors, represent the black
American experience during the civil rights activism of the 1950s and 1960s.
The play is set in Greenwood, Mississippi in the early 1960s, and stretches
forward and back from there. By then, that day in 1955 when Rosa Parks
failed to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama had become civil
rights history; Martin Luther King emerged as the leader there in 1955, but
the activists were slower to reach the delta.
The play focuses on the life of Ida Mae Holland and her mother, Aunt Baby,
who was a midwife. There are pictures of domestic toil, a terrifying
breach-birth scene, and vignettes of neighbourhood characters; out of these,
Ida Mae Holland's character emerges with a decency and honesty born of hard
work and deprivation: 'Yo' c'n look over yo' friends when yo' is low, but
yo' sure c'n't look over them when yo' is pickin' in high cotton.'
She tries erotic dancing, prostitution, self education and then college in
Minneapolis; north of Memphis, en route to Chicago, the diner car joins the
train - 'and anyone can eat there.' But before she graduates, her mother is
burned to death by arsonists, the scent of Magnolia and burnt flesh on the
delta breeze.
The final scene pays tribute to Martin Luther King, Jimi Hendrix (the
inimitable 'Star Spangled Banner') and Alice Walker, who says simply, 'we
are not the first to suffer.' While Ida Mae Holland lacks the popular appeal
of Toni Morrison or the depth of Zora Neale Hurston, she does speak for
black women's lives; like her mother, 'she taught us we could do more things
than she had words for.'
The easy physicality and trust between the actors (Pauline Black, Josette
Bushell-Mingo and Joy Richardson) creates and focuses energy on stage, while
the direction (Annie Castledine and Sue MacLennan) drives the action quickly
around the bare set walled with rusty corrugated iron. The a capella
singing, however, tempts one to wish for something more substantial; some
delta blues on slide and harmonica would add musical body, but the singing
at the revivalist funeral is still unforgettable.
Cochrane Theatre (071-242-7040) until May 1; Contact Theatre, Manchester
(061-274-4400) May 12 - June 5.

FT  14 APR 93 / People: In Shops settles its succession in-house
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After almost two years without a managing director, In Shops, the
Birmingham-based property group specialising in retail centres and serviced
offices, has appointed Derek Hine, 40, to the position.
Hine joined In Shops in May 1991 as managing director of its main
subsidiary, retail centres, but also took over running its executive centres
last year, and was appointed to the board last December. After waiting until
it was sure it had the right candidate, In Shops has now decided to name
Hine group managing director, in succession to John Hoesli, who died in
1991.
He will be responsible for day-to-day running of the group, while Tim
Brookes, chief executive, will oversee strategy. Hine has 23 years of retail
experience, firstly with Fine Fare, where he started as a Saturday boy in
1968 and rose to become buying director of meat and poultry.
He spent a year with Dixons financial services division before being
approached in 1988 to be director of Ranks Hovis McDougall Retail, running
300 cafes and bakery shops across the UK.
He says his main challenge at In Shops will be trying to protect clients on
the retail and office side from the effects of recession, which pushed In
Shops' interim pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 903,000 last
December. 'Times are tough but we are certainly not lying down and crying
into our hands about how terrible the recession is. If the cake is
diminished, we need to get a bigger share of the cake.'

FT  14 APR 93 / People: KPMG set to pick Sharman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Sharman, head of consulting at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, is set
to become senior partner of the firm when Jim Butler retires at the end of
the year.
A nomination committee to choose Butler's successor made Sharman its single
recommendation for the appointment last month and is now taking further
soundings before a final meeting of the firm's board of 26 senior partners
on April 27.
Its view is unlikely to change, although the decision must be ratified by a
vote of the full partnership - 600 in all. The nomination committee itself
comprises four members of the firm's board, and three others chosen by the
partnership at large.
'At 64 I'm getting to be quite an old man by the standard of some of the
partners,' Butler says. He is likely to pursue other activities but has not
yet made a decision on what these would be.
Sharman (above) has been credited with turning around the consulting
division of the firm, and is currently responsible for implementing '20/20
vision', a wide-ranging programme to restructure the internal organisation
of the firm and make it more focused on its clients' needs.
Butler's retirement as senior partner will follow shortly after his
resignation as chairman of the international KPMG network after nearly three
years at the end of September.
He will be replaced by Hans Havermann (far right), senior partner of the
firm's German practice and chairman of its European board. Jon Madonna,
senior partner of the US practice, will become international deputy
chairman, and Ross Walker, Canadian senior partner, international executive
partner.
The appointment of Stephen Barrett (right) to the corporate finance division
of KPMG Peat Marwick marks the first time a lawyer and merchant banker has
become a partner in the accountancy firm.
Barrett began his career as an assistant with solicitors Norton Rose and
became a member of the Law Society, before switching to merchant banking. He
worked for 10 years at Lloyds Merchant Bank before its closure, which was
announced late last year.
He says he joined KPMG partly because of its range of professional expertise
and industry knowledge. He also argues that corporate finance is polarising
between the 'big battalion merchant banks' and the professional service
providers such as his new firm. It is those in the middle which will be
squeezed, he argues.
'Gone are the days when a client simply wanted a transaction manager,' he
says. 'They want an adviser to participate in their growth and be truly
pro-active.'
He says the transition from the racy culture of a banker to the more sober
corridors of accountancy is not proving too great, partly because of the
nature of those already working in KPMG's unit.

FT  14 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Commerce and culture prompt a
cleaner Japan - Worldwide Water / Tokyo wants purer supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Russian navy confessed last month to having routinely dumped
nuclear waste materials in the Sea of Japan, government leaders in Tokyo
reacted with uncharacteristic bluntness, describing the action as
'unbelievable' and a 'disgrace'.
The tough response reflects the Japanese sensitivity to water purity, a
sensitivity heightened by the country's past mishandling of its own water
resources and by an ongoing debate over balancing the needs of industry with
the rights of domestic users to clean water.
But it is typical of the Japanese response to the dilemma that the
government did not only criticise Russia. Today, Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, will offer technological assistance to Russia's nuclear industry
at a meeting of finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations.
In a sense, the Russian navy had done in the 1990s what Japanese industry
was guilty of during the rapid years of industrial growth in the 1950s and
1960s. Inspired by a desire to 'build a strong Japan', the country
consciously sacrificed the quality of its river and sea water for the cause
of industrial growth.
The turning point in Japan came after the Minamata poisoning case, which
began in 1957 and still dominates any debate on water quality. Chisso, a
chemicals manufacturer, had pumped mercury refuse into the waters around the
town of Minamata, on the southern island of Kyushu, contaminating fish and
leading to the poisoning of the local population and the deformity of
newborn children.
Chisso denied responsibility and continued to pump materials into the sea
long after the first cases were discovered, but has since admitted its
guilt. Meanwhile, negligence actions are still moving slowly and painfully
through the Japanese courts in an attempt to prove that government controls
were too lax. Even without a clear court precedent, the images of Minamata
were shocking enough for the government to take action.
The Minamata case challenged Japan's self-image. Water and its purity are a
prime inspiration for poets and painters, while the eating of fish, raw or
cooked, is seen as part of the Japanese culture. The mass poisoning of a
local community prompted many to conclude that the Japanese way of life,
along with water, was in need of protection.
Tetsuya Ikeda, chief of the water supply division at the Ministry of Health
and Welfare, says the accumulation of industrial pollution from the
high-growth era still affects the water supply, in spite of two decades of
anti-pollution campaigning that has imposed increasingly tough standards on
factories.
'The biggest problem for us now is to get rid of the foul smell and
unpleasant taste of water,' Ikeda says. The problem is particularly severe
in the greater Tokyo area, home to 30m people and still a heavy industrial
centre.
'In 1983, we found about 80 sources were polluted, and less than 10m people
suffered with bad smell and taste. Last year 100 sources had a problem and
about 20m people suffered.'
Concern about water quality has stimulated demand for mineral waters,
increasingly used by parents fearing for their children's health.
Technically, Ikeda says, that there is no danger to health from Tokyo water,
but youth magazines have gone as far as encouraging their readers to use
only mineral water when shampooing their hair.
Domestic mineral water production rose from 101,000 kilolitres in 1989 to
300,000kl last year, while mineral water imports rose from 16,279kl to
45,594kl over the same period. The Japan Mineral Water Association says
'people are worried about their health', and want to be certain that their
drinking water is pure.
Demand for pure water has led to a doubling of water purifier sales in each
of the past three years. Toshiba, the electronics group, this month launched
new coffee makers and kettles with built-in purifiers. Mitsubishi Electric
has just begun selling high-powered engines for domestic wells, increasingly
popular among families wanting to draw their own water.
There is also widespread concern about preserving natural water courses. The
most controversial environmental issue in Japan over the past five years has
been a plan to dam the Nagara River, in the Chubu region of central Japan.
Local opponents to the project say the dam is unnecessary and will threaten
wildlife, while the regional government argues that it will prevent flooding
and make better use of water resources.
The Nagara dispute and a current political scandal, involving kickbacks to
politicians for public works projects, have led to greater public debate
over the management of resources and stimulated interest in the
privatisation of water resources. Typically, the construction ministry will
undertake large infrastructure projects, while the resources will be managed
by local governments.
Electricity and railway networks are privately run in Japan and the
government has sent a delegation to study the British experience in water
privatisation. But a member of the delegation says the management
efficiencies that may result from privatisation are not compelling enough to
overcome bureaucratic opposition to such reforms.

FT  14 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Cleaning up the battle zones -
Rebel attacks on oil pipelines have taken their toll on Colombia's forests
and farmlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a million barrels of crude oil have spilt out of Colombia's
pipelines over the last six years, polluting wetlands, streams, forests and
farmlands. The environment is one of the principal victims of the guerrilla
war on foreign oil companies and the state petroleum company, Ecopetrol, has
become expert at emergency clean-ups.
But it is not just clean-up technology that has blossomed in Colombia.
Legislation, refining and management standards are also improving fast and
some of the measures taken to safeguard oil installations from the
guerrillas are turning out to be unexpectedly friendly to the environment.
Both of the main oil producing regions are well inland: most of the older
fields and the main refining centre are strung out along the Magdalena
valley, while newer discoveries (including Cusiana and Cupiagua, explored by
BP) lie east of the Andean mountain ranges in the 'Llanos' plains.
Guerrillas belonging to the left-wing national liberation army (ELN) and the
communist-line revolutionary armed forces of Colombia (FARC) roam these
areas, assaulting and dynamiting their targets, then disappearing into
forest camps or local settlements virtually under their command. The rebel
groups - which aim to force oil multinationals out and impose a more
nationalist oil policy - have financed their activities by kidnap and
extortion. The government is trying to cut off these sources of funds, at
the same time sending in more troops.
Although the three trans-Andean pipelines are buried wherever possible,
there are particularly vulnerable stretches across rugged gullies and
swamps. In any case, a little digging has never been an obstacle to the
guerrillas. In 1992, there were more than a hundred attacks on these three
pipelines, costing Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) in clean-ups and repairs. Oil
exports virtually ceased in November and part of December, forfeiting over
Dollars 100m of income, while a million barrels of crude had to be imported
from Ecuador at short notice. Repairs to the pipeline are made more
difficult by guerrilla efforts to prevent access.
Ecopetrol and the oil research institute have developed a pipeline database
which details petrol sites, key observation posts, hydrology, access roads,
response times and available equipment such as floating booms, oil skimmers
and suction pumps. If the pipeline is dynamited in a very steep section and
oil spills into a fast-flowing river, little can be done.
'We have to act in places where the river flows down and widens out,' said
Jaime George, head of Ecopetrol's environmental division. 'We don't use
dispersants in rivers because they mix oil into the water and this could go
into a water supply system. In the case of wetlands, we are monitoring
constantly. The leaves of any contaminated vegetation must be removed - this
takes a lot of time but the tropical climate helps recovery.'
Repeated guerrilla attacks have led companies to centralise their production
facilities, which serve both security and environmental ends. Ecopetrol is
cutting the number of collection centres in one area of the Magdalena from
76 to 6. BP will drill a number of deviated wells off the same sites at
Cusiana. Each site has lookout posts with armed guards and helicopters fly
unusually high between landings. Cupiagua 1, alongside a main road, is
protected by sandbags.
The oil companies and the guerrillas are to some extent competing for the
heart and minds of nearby communities. The government recently decided to
move settlers farther away from oilfields on the grounds that guerrillas
have encouraged their sympathisers to occupy these areas and give them cover
and support.
The companies provide jobs, build schools, health centres and roads, and
feed royalties to the local authorities. Occidental, which operates the Cano
Limon export field, runs a massive publicity campaign on television and in
the newspapers stressing its environmental and community work.
'Last year, the consortium spent over Dollars 8m on environmental protection
at Cano Limon - about half on pipeline clean-ups and half on other projects
 -scientific studies, the sanitary landfill and so on,' says Ed Metcalf of
Occidental. The company has sponsored studies on mammals, fish and insects
and planted over 400,000 trees - 20 times more than the figure required by
the Natural Resources Institute.
BP, which is drilling deep wells in an area with highly-complex geology, has
introduced 'powerful and sophisticated equipment,' says Phil Mead, the
operations manager. All the water at Cupiagua 1 is recirculated in a series
of three minimum-sized pits, and water - rather than oil-based mud - is
being used for drilling. There have been problems with two sites - one where
a landslide occurred and another where the local community complained that
the well was located too close to a river.
Carlos Fonseca, an environmental expert at Bogota's Lasalle University,
says: 'The outlook is very positive now; both national and foreign companies
are much more aware. But employees need extra training for the new standards
and we must have more environmental audits.' Although everyone agrees there
is still room for improvement, Colombians have come to associate the image
of oil-soaked birds with guerrilla actions rather than company operations.

FT  14 APR 93 / People: Fleming scoops up a Rockefeller
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rockefellers may not be as rich as they once were, but the name still
has a cachet in financial circles. Hence the appointment of David
Rockefeller, head of the fourth generation of the family, as a non-executive
director of Fleming Overseas Investment Trust, is quite a coup for London
merchant bankers Robert Fleming.
Lord Mark Fitzalan Howard, the Fleming director in charge of the group's
investment trust operations, says that his bank has been associated with the
Rockefeller family for many years. The two parties used to have a joint
venture which invested in unquoted securities and Rockefeller Financial
Services, which looks after the family's extensive business and
philanthropic interests, has an office in Fleming's headquarters.
Despite his name, David Rockefeller, 51, is a relatively recent convert to
big business. After studying economics at Cambridge University and law at
Harvard, he worked as assistant manager of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for
five years before becoming executive vice-president of The Real Paper, a
liberal weekly based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During his newspaper
sojourn he also moonlighted as a singer with The Boston Camerate.
However, after a short spell as an adjunct professor at Columbia
University's School of Arts in New York he joined the family firm as a
consultant in 1982. Ten years later, he was elected chairman of Rockefeller
Financial services succeeding his father, once chairman of Chase Manhattan
Bank.
The Rockefeller family fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at Dollars
5.5bn, is shared out among the near 100 members of the family of John D
Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil and the world's first billionaire.

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 6: Green initiatives sow growth
seeds - Leicester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE late 1980s, when nearly every British town and city north of London
(and a good few south of it) were vigorously chasing new investment to
replace declining industries, little was heard from Leicester.
Leicester had its share of large company collapses arising from the
recession of the early 1980s, particularly in textiles and light
engineering. Now, apart from the utilities, no private sector company
employs more than a few hundred. But job losses never rose as steeply as in
nearby Coventry, or Corby. Throughout the decade unemployment did not exceed
the national average and was usually below the regional average.
Today, unemployment in the travel-to-work area of Leicester is 9.2 per cent
compared with a national average of 10.7 per cent. (As with most British
cities there are pockets of higher unemployment in deprived inner-city
areas.)
Leicester is unusual in not having attracted either an important government
office relocation or any significant white-collar or service company
investment in the last 10 years. Yet it has it has managed to contain
average unemployment. Moreover, despite the shakeout in large textile
companies, 36 per cent of the workforce is still employed in manufacturing.
The national average is 23 per cent.
The reason is the dramatic growth in Asian businesses. Ethnic minorities now
make up 28 per cent of the city's population; Indians from Uganda
predominate. The Asian business community has permeated many areas of
commercial life and is not confined to the corner store so familiar in many
cities. It is also involved in manufacturing, especially textiles.
Mr Imtiaz Farookhi, chief executive of Leicester City Council for the last
18 months, says: 'I do not know why Leicester did not try to attract new
outside investment in the past. It was before my time. Perhaps it believed
there was no need. Certainly the Asian business sector saved the city from
the worst ravages of recession.' Now, however, the city is trying to sell
itself.
It is not that the Asian sector is beginning to falter, although many
retailers are having a tougher time in the current recession than the last.
It is because of a realisation that there may be a limit to how far Asian
businesses can continue to trade up and add value. There is also an
acceptance that something extra will be needed to carry the city into the
late 1990s.
Ms Penny Baker, director of Leicester Promotions, says: 'There is a feeling
that Leicester has undersold and undervalued itself in the past. It seemed
overshadowed by places like Nottingham. The Inland Revenue relocated to
Nottingham and Nottingham almost captured English Heritage.' Leicester
Promotions, described as an 'arm's length' company by Ms Baker, has
representatives from private business,the public sector and local community
organisations. It is part of the new effort to market the city.
Leicester's profile was raised further in 1990 by being designated the UK's
first 'environment city'.
At last year's United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Leicester
Environment City was included among the world's 12 leading urban
initiatives. This award has, in turn, brought the city an EC award of Ecus
1.2m for environmental improvement campaigns.
The Leicester environment campaign involves more than 60 initiatives,
including the building of cycle tracks, paths to cut down on traffic
pollution, waste re-cycling, and energy conservation.
Mr Ian Roberts, director of Leicester Environment City, feels that a good
environmental image is important if Leicester wants to develop as a
post-industrial city and attract tourists and leisure industries.
He adds, however: 'It is not just a question of post industrial activity. We
run an advisory service. Given a constantly changing legislative background
it is important that companies know what is expected of them.'
Leicester's search for new investment has been hampered by a lack of
greenfield sites and by the shortage of modern B1 light industrial and
office space. The boundaries of the city are tightly drawn.
Existing B1 space is estimated at about 1m sq ft, but it is old and divided
into small units. A property of 50,000 sq ft would be deemed large.
Hopes are pinned on the 'City Challenge' area to attract new investment and
bring about inner city regeneration.
The area of 370 hectares (888 acres) which won a bid in the second round of
the government's city challenge programme last November is called Bede
Island. It is on the River Soar and close to the city centre.
The government has awarded Pounds 37.5m over five years. It is hoped that
this money will help to generate some Pounds 169m of private sector
investment and create 3,000 new jobs.
The key commercial developments will be a science park and other office and
and shopping units.
There are also plans to build a fashion museum. The reasoning here is that,
unlike other former industrial cities, Leicester does not have the normal
tourist draws like a beautiful cathedral. Nor has it developed attractions
based on its industrial past such as the museum of photography in Bradford,
the beer museum in Burton-on-Trent or the Albert Dock in Liverpool.
A fashion museum would emphasise Leicester's historical links with the
textile industry and tie in with De Montfort University, the former
polytechnic, which has more than 20,000 students and a campus close to the
proposed site. It has a strong tradition of fashion studies as well as
engineering and would be close to both the museum and the science park.
The city challenge scheme could be seen as another urban development
corporation. Development of B1 property and shops could have led to tensions
with the local population as occurred in the London Docklands or Bristol.
But Mr Keith Beaumont, the chief executive, who was once head of the
Sheffield UDC, says the situation here is different 'because the community
is actively involved. This is not developer-led - and anyway, some 13,500
people live in the area.'
More than a fifth of this population is aged 60 and over. About a quarter is
made up of ethnic minorities. A high proportion of students live in the
area. The unemployment rate is 13.6 per cent. Approximately two fifths of
households receive some form of benefit. About eight hectares is derelict
land, a quarter of the city's total.
Much discussion and planning has taken place to ensure that the social needs
of this deprived area will be addressed. As well as developing business
premises, there will be a lot of funds devoted to environmental improvements
and to social conditions. Some 900 houses will be improved and several
hundred new units built.
Mr Alistair Reid, the principal economic development officer at the city
council, sees the city challenge project as the spearhead of the attempt to
attract new investment to Leicester. Asked whether Leicester has missed the
boat now that government departments are not relocating from London as much
as in the 1980s, he says: 'You could say that. But there will be other
boats. Relocation out of the south-east will go on for years once the
economy picks up.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 7: Families are tightly knit -
Asian businessmen are looking to new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ASIAN community and its involvement in Leicester's economy has grown
rapidly in the last 20 years.
Ethnic minorities now account for about 28 per cent of the city's population
of 280,000. The dominant communities are Asian: Hindus who arrived from
Uganda in the 1970s; Sikhs from the Punjab, and Moslems from Pakistan.
Mr Bullu Patel is the development officer for ethnic communities in the
'City Challenge' area of Leicester. Formerly business development officer at
the chamber of commerce, he thinks that it is nearly impossible to estimate
the contribution made by Asian businesses to the city's economy. He says:
'So many employees are relatives - and therefore often not officially
registered as workers. Asian businesses can be coy about output. As near as
I can estimate there are 4000 ethnic - mostly Asian - businesses in
Leicester.'
These include many small corner shops: grocers, supermarkets, pharmacies,
jewellers, clothes and dress shops. But significantly, Asians have also
expanded into manufacturing, particularly textiles.
In a sense, Asian businesses in Leicester have anticipated a national trend.
Large, monolithic, footwear and garment manufacturers with predominantly
male, heavily unionised, well-paid workforces, began to shrink or even to
disappear during the 1980s, under the pressure of cheap foreign competition.
They were replaced by some Asian manufacturers employing females, who are
paid less well.
One such is the Poshak group, which also trades as Water Rose. Poshak is run
by Mr GS Bakshi, a Sikh, with his son Miti, who is 29, and Miti's cousin
Ringo, 28. Other than a non-Asian accountant, there are no other directors
or managers. There are 70 employees, many of them family. There are two
silk-screen machines and an embroidery unit. The three Bakshis work from
seven o'clock in the morning to eight or nine o'clock at night.
Because most of the people sitting over the sewing machines are family
members, there are flexible working arrangements over pay and conditions. Mr
GS Bakshi declined to say what the wage rates were, but admitted that some
workers were on piece rates. The company's success, however, depends only
partly in controlling costs.
Mr Miti Bakshi says: 'We came here from London in 1987. Everything is better
value for money - wages, the buildings, raw materials.'
But he adds: 'We cannot compete on cost. You could import a T-shirt from
Hong Kong for 70p. The yarn alone would cost us that. The cheapest we could
produce a bottom-of-the-range T-shirt is 150p. Where we compete is by being
close to the ground and being flexible. Let me give you an example. We know
our customers very well. They are wholesalers. If they import some garments
which turn out not to be the right colour they often turn to us. We can
supply them within three days.'
Fast throughput is thus as important as cost. Mr Ringo Bakshi says the
factory turns out 35,000 garments a week and that the factory is never
without yarn. Asked whether the company has been affected by the recession,
Mr Miti Bakshi says: 'No, what recession?' This may be true for Poshak, but
Mr Bullu Patel says the downturn in retailing has caused other textile
manufacturers to have a more difficult time. 'What some of them have done is
to load up lorries full of garments, drive to places like Germany and sell
to East Europeans.'
The need to find new markets has led to the formation of a group called
Asians Tackling Business, run by four second-generation Asian professionals.
One of the directors, Mr Jitendra Patel, a solicitor, says: 'What the
recession has done is make many businesses realise they must become more
sophisticated. Banks who never bothered companies before now want quarterly
statements. What we aim to do is convince Asians that they are not running
just Asian businesses but businesses like anybody else.'
Mr Ashwin Moody, another director, says a lot can be done in the area of
marketing. He says: 'We are holding a range of seminars on the local
economy, banking in Switzerland, importing and exporting, and dealing with
local government and merchant banking.'
Mr Bullu Patel says: 'Asian businessmen do not like control to go outside
the family, so I do not see any Asian businesses growing into large
country-wide concerns. But they will start up new businesses and spread into
areas such as corporate image-making, marketing, financial services, in
which Asians are currently not involved.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 4: A forest for the future - A look
at county planning problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY planners are forced to tread a narrow line between the desire to
foster economic growth and the needs of the countryside.
Their latest attempt is in the updating of the county structure plan which
will establish the main land use patterns into the next century. Their
favoured approach to economic development is to concentrate it in the urban
areas and, 'of the smaller amount of new development which occurs elsewhere,
most should be in locations along the transport corridors.'
These corridors include the railway lines, among them the new Ivanhoe Line,
and the A6 road between Leicester and Loughborough. Apart from development
related to junctions 23a and 24 of the M1, near East Midlands International
Airport and where the M42/A42 and M1 join, planners dislike development
along main roads unless related to existing urban areas.
Mr Richard Phelps, who conducted a public enquiry into the provisions of the
structure plan last autumn, was broadly sympathetic to this approach At any
rate, development will not be allowed to rampage through the countryside.
But Leicestershire has particular problems with minerals. Not that it has
none - it has. As the county council explains, they 'can give rise to
adverse environmental impact unless sites are carefully chosen, operated and
monitored.' The county is an important aggregates producing areas of the UK,
home of British Coal's Ashfordby superpit.
As opencast operations are not necessarily friendly neighbours, there has
been considerable local agitation about opencast coal and quarrying planning
applications. The planners wanted to restrict coal operations to one
important major coal site and have the coal transported by rail. And,
because most of the rock quarries and most of the reserves are in areas of
'high scenic value', the planners are prepared to consider extensions to
existing quarries but have come out against new greenfield sites.
Mr Phelps was less restrictive. He would have none of the council's proposed
restrictions on the transport of coal, questioned how a site would be
defined as 'major' and recommended that 'planning applications for opencast
coal mining should be considered on their individual merits.'
So the mineral arguments are likely to continue in the county. British Coal
has identified only one area, in the north west of the county, as being of
open coal interest. But in an effort to still the arguments, the local
authorities, British Coal and private operators have been talking about how
to devise a long term coal programme which will meet their interests and
satisfy environmental considerations.
North West Leicestershire, indeed, is one of the county's priority areas for
development. The underground coal mines closed during the 1980s. Around 50
per cent of employment is industrial, but jobs have been disappearing during
the recession so that the proportion of long term unemployed is a third of
the jobless total. Economic growth in the 1980s by-passed the area.
In an area where the straggling coalmining villages provide a sharp contrast
to the prosperous, manicured settlements of the eastern part of the county,
there is little desire to snuff out employment opportunities, whether they
come from opencast mining or not. But it is because the area has become
rundown that it has become part of one of the UK's boldest environmental
initiatives. If the initiative started by the Countryside Commission
succeeds, it will create that virtuous circle of economic development and
environmental care which the county council wants.
This is the creation of a new National Forest over 194 square miles in
Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire: It is an attempt both to
rehabilitate the countryside by creating wooded land with a mix of uses,
rather than pure forest, and to give new life to an area turning its back on
past industry without seeing the future clearly.
'Clean up the environment and make it attractive and this will attract
investment,' said Mr Alan Tuppen, the County Council's economic development
officer with - at the back of his mind - a vision of small woodlands
business parks.
'The mining villages have been isolated but they could be brought back into
the economic ambit by the A42 (recently brought up to near motorway standard
and linking the M42 to the M1), the Ivanhoe Line and the National Forest,'
Mr Tuppen suggests.
But the National Forest is a long term venture which has barely started,
although the first indications of willingness among farmers to turn land
over to trees are beginning to emerge and companies like East Midlands
Electricity and, for that matter British Coal, are supportive.
The unemployment rate in Measham, a North West Leicestershire mining
village, is running at over 20 per cent, the highest in the county outside
inner Leicester wards. Economic decline set in when the local pit closed in
1985.
The problems of rural areas in the county, by contrast, have been emerging
more gradually. Just as there is a decline in industrial employment, so
there is in agricultural employment. Leicestershire Training and Enterprise
Council (TEC) notes: 'The national decline in agricultural employment will
have the greatest impact on the more rural districts of Leicestershire -
Harborough, Rutland and Melton.'
In the same way as the pit closure in Measham set off a search for economic
diversification, farmers have been travelling down the same road, prompted
by the erosion of once assured markets and by the reduction of subsidies.
But the farmers appear to have gone further.
The Leicestershire TEC, in conjunction with neighbouring TECs and
agricultural training organisations, found after a survey of farms in the
county that that 44 per cent had diversified into - by order of frequency -
contracting, retail outlets, farm building developments, leisure activities,
holiday accommodation, transport and distribution and added value produce.
But the TEC warns: 'It is uncertain as to whether diversification activities
will either increase employment opportunities or fully employ existing
labour in the long term.' That will strike a chord in North West
Leicestershire. But the difference between the mining villages and the rural
areas is that the former must create a new environment to provide a future
while the latter have to preserve and manipulate the existing environment.

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 3: Export-led exit from recession -
Businesses in the county sense a turning point has been passed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Geoffrey Nicholls, chairman of the East Midlands CBI, emerged from the
latest meeting of the regional council with a smile. It was, he said, the
most positive meeting for two years. Leicestershire business is caught in
this upturn of regional confidence.
It was reflected by Mr Alan Green, chief executive of the county's chamber
of commerce, as he considered the raw data from the latest, so far
unpublished, survey of local business trends. The returns show that more
than 58 per cent of companies in the county are working at or above 80 per
cent capacity.
The chamber's export documentation, provided for the Far East, Latin
American and Middle East markets, has been running 15 per cent higher in the
first quarter of this year compared with last. 'The turning point came in
January as the lower value of the pound manifested itself in overseas
markets,' says Mr Green.
As for two of the county's most significant industries, Mr Nicholls reports
how busy the Leicestershire knitwear industry has been, while Mr Green's
surveys suggest shoe companies had been enjoying fresh demand in the export
markets.
Advance Tapes, the Leicester adhesive tapes company whose spread of
customers across industry makes it a useful barometer, has scented an upturn
for a year. 'The majority of increased orders, until the last three months,
have been in overseas markets. Since mid-January we've started to show an
upturn in the rate of UK orders,' says Mr David Ayres, the chairman.
In the machine tool sector, a monitor of investment intentions, Mr John
Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, notes that there has been
more quotations activity in recent weeks, and that prices among the
company's sub-contractors have started to harden. 'There are signs of an
upturn in UK demand, and in the US, but, with the exception of France, the
rest of Europe is not encouraging,' he warns.
The caveat about the European downturn notwithstanding, there is a clear
impression in Leicestershire that the force of recession is on the wane.
Given that manufacturing accounts for 33.3 per cent of Leicestershire
employment, compared with 27.4 per cent for the East Midlands and 22.5 per
cent for the UK as a whole, the reasons for relief are obvious. But the
recession has done little to change the structural imbalances in the
county's industrial base. The strengths and weaknesses remain intact.
In spite of the recession's litany of job cuts, employment remains skewed
towards the textiles, clothing and footwear sector. At the last employment
census the proportion of such jobs in Leicester was higher than in other
traditional textile districts such as Nottingham, Manchester, Bolton and
Bury.
Yet, in terms of gross output, the contribution to the county economy of the
textiles, clothing and footwear sector is less than that of either the
combined engineering industries, long a pillar of the industrial base, or
the food and drink industry, where, although employment has fallen, there
have been marked increases in output and productivity.
The weakness for the future is the relatively slow growth of high technology
industry. 'New technology industries are under-represented in the county,
although the number of jobs in these industries is growing,' according to
the county council. In Leicestershire such industries accounted for 9.5 per
cent of manufacturing jobs against a national average of 13 per cent.
The obvious growth has been in the distribution sector - a recognition of
the fact that 88 per cent of the UK population is within four hours drive by
heavy goods vehicle - in tourism, and in the services sector. By no stretch
of the imagination, however, can Leicestershire be seen as a focal point for
financial services.
The abiding characteristic of Leicestershire's corporate structure is the
high number of small and medium-sized companies. To be sure, the county is
the headquarters for British Gypsum, British Midland Airways, British Shoe
Corporation, Fisons Pharmaceuticals and United Biscuits. And the county
industries include well-known names such as Bridgport, Brush, Caterpillar,
R. Griggs (maker of Doc Martens), Evans Lifts, Triumph Motorcycles and
Walkers Crisps. But few companies employ more than a few hundred and 75 per
cent of companies employ fewer than 25.
Arguably, the recession has caused further fragmentation of the corporate
structure. 'Much is to do with redundancies of departmental managers in
larger companies. The only choice for them is to go into business on their
own account,' says Mr Green. Take spare parts for knitting machines: a
machinery maker goes into liquidation, but because knitting machines can
have an almost limitless life, there is a demand for spare parts, which can
be filled by a small company spun out out of the liquidating company.
This predominance of companies is, in one sense, a source of strength. 'When
recovery comes, it will not be the larger companies which recruit, but the
smaller companies,' comments Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of Pal
International, the Oadby hygiene and protective clothing manufacturer, and
chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council.
But a weakness is that one of the strongest fountains of small company
growth has been in the textiles, clothing and footwear sector, which remains
under pressure from imports and in long term decline. And small companies
are likely to remain dependent on the UK market and vulnerable to its
erratic cycles.
It is precisely the need to succour the small company sector which has led
Leicestershire enthusiastically to espouse the cause of the One Stop shop.
Although there are a plethora of national and local initiatives in place to
help small companies with exporting, technology transfer, business planning
and the rest, the need to draw together the facilities for small companies
has been obvious and pressing.
Application has been made to the department of trade and industry for its
support in establishing one of its chain of One Stop shops in the county.
But, even if that fails, the county council, Leicester City Council,
Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council and the Chamber of Commerce
will go ahead on their own.

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 5: Naturally at the centre -
Distribution and warehousing have developed fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A look at a map of Britain shows why Leicestershire has become a centre for
distribution and warehousing.
It is geographically at the centre of the country, and the M1 motorway runs
through the county north/south.
Mr Alan Tuppen, economic development officer for Leicestershire county
council, says: 'We are like a lot of local authorities. We do not like the
idea of vast tracts of our countryside being covered in warehousing sheds.
Distribution does not provide many value added jobs, and takes up a lot of
space. On the other hand, we must be realistic and recognise that our
geographical position means we are a natural centre for distribution.'
Consents for business parks with varying degrees of B8 or warehousing
properties have been given without much fuss. Leicestershire has five main
business parks within its boundaries.
There is Meridian 21, of which Wilson Bowden is the developer. There is
Interlink (also under the aegis of Wilson Bowden). Bardon has Gallifords as
developer. There is Flagship 42 near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, which is being
developed by London and Devonshire. And there is Magna Park, which is being
developed by Gazeley, a subsidiary of Asda, in conjunction with the Church
Commissioners.
These parks cover several hundred acres and have several million sq ft of
property on them. They employ fewer than 5,000 people.
Meridian 21 is an industrial park with some manufacturers on its existing
110 acres. Magna Park has been built as a dedicated distribution centre.
Close to Lutterworth, in a triangle bordered by the M1, M6 and M69, Magna
Park was originally an RAF aerodrome.
Mr Andrew Griffiths, senior development surveyor of Gazeley, which has been
developing the centre, says Magna Park has been a great success. 75 per cent
of the 4.2m sq ft developed so far has been let. (Clients typically take the
properties on long leases; rents work out at about Pounds 4.50 a sq ft.)
Tenants include Nissan, Panasonic and Toyota. Phase two will provide a
further 3.5m sq ft, with a Pounds 9m Lutterworth by-pass linking the site to
the M1 (the developer will be paying for this).
One reason for the success of Magna Park is obviously the location. Mr
Griffiths estimates that over 90 per cent of destinations can be reached
within a day's drive. East coast ports such as Felixstowe and Harwich are
just over three hours away; Liverpool is a two hour drive. Heading south, it
is three hours to Portsmouth.
But the other factor is the sheer size of the warehouses. Mr Griffiths says
that the advance in information technology and the improvements in storage
and handling techniques have revolutionised the distribution industry.
With computers, shops, supermarkets and factories can know their needs down
to the last detail. This means that if a warehouse is big enough it can take
huge consignments from the ports and then distribute smaller loads by
shuttle.
Improvement in handling techniques - bigger fork lift trucks, mechanical
handling and the like - also means that distribution centres can store much
more, because goods can be piled higher. Mr Griffiths says: 'Better
technology has advanced distribution. A typical Asda supermarket would
receive 40 visits by lorries a day. Today, with computerised control and
bigger storage facilities, the number of visits is down to five. This cuts
down congestion and also costs.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 1: County of contrasts - The
distribution industry and a dynamic Asian business sector have helped to
cushion the county from decline in textiles, shoes and engineering. Business
parks able to attract high technology are now being promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LEICESTERSHIRE is contradictory. It has the external sheen of prosperity but
the internal fear of poverty. It is like the business in a mature market
which sees the future sliding away as newer products seduce regular
customers.
On one hand, there is the quintessential shire county, with its picture
postcard villages and dreamy countryside, the old England which never dies,
with three district council areas said to be among the 20 most affluent in
the UK. and whose come-hither literature asserts the status of 'one of the
UK's most enterprising and consistently successful locations.'
On the other, there is the county with the full range of urban problems,
which has joined the rush to London and Brussels pleading access to
subsidies. 'Leicestershire's economy is in decline and showing weakness from
heavy dependence on traditional and declining manufacturing industries.'
Certainly recession sapped confidence in established business. Although
county unemployment at 8.5 per cent has been lower than both the East
Midlands and the national level, the average disguised pockets of high male
unemployment in the inner urban wards of Leicester, Loughborough, Hinckley,
Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough.
Unemployment rose harshly around the traditional poles of the county economy
 -textiles, footwear and engineering. By the end of the decade, a further
25,000 manufacturing jobs are expected to disappear - in perspective, more
than the total for all mechanical engineering employment calculated in the
1989 employment census.
For all that, economic pain has been less acute in Leicestershire than in,
say, the industrial areas of the West Midlands. 'Over the last few years it
was not so much desperate recession as gentle decline,' said Mr Richard
Brucciani, chairman of Pal International, the hygiene and protective
clothing manufacturer in Oadby and chairman of the smaller firms council of
the Confederation of British Industry. 'We've got a little dowdy.'
Now evidence is accumulating that recession is ending. Higher levels of
orders across most sectors in the county economy has brought a return of
confidence. 'People have stopped scowling and started smiling,' says Mr John
Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester machine tools
group.
Of course, an upturn in orders will bring relief. But sustained growth in
the national economy, at a rate faster than most observers believe possible,
will be necessary if Leicestershire is to approach an answer to the
fundamental question it has been posed: how can enough jobs be provided for
a labour force which is not only increasing but which will be weighted
towards the over-35 age group?
There is a secular decline in the number of engineering jobs. The footwear
industry has been successful in establishing niche markets for high quality
products, but unsuccessful in protecting its domestic base for mass
products. The textile industry has changed its shape into a congeries of
smaller companies, able to react quickly to changing market conditions but
always prey to imports. The deep coal mining industry has ceased to exist;
surface mining is both limited in scale and, not unnaturally, subject to
environmental constraints.
There is then little prospect that the fundamental question can be answered
through the traditional industrial base. As the county council complained to
the European Commission: 'Earnings for both men and women are well below the
national average and the gap is getting larger. Investment in the county's
manufacturing sector is well below the growth in manufacturing investment
generally.'
Nor can the county expect any immediate fillip from relocation of government
departments or agencies from London. The first phase has bypassed Leicester;
if an East Midlands city has been favoured, it is Nottingham.
To be sure, in recent years both city and county have sought to argue their
case more forcefully: there has been more enthusiasm than in most parts of
the East Midlands for a regional development organisation and there is
widespread disappointment that the headquarters of this putative body will
be in Nottingham.
The most obvious immediate source of growth from inward investment is
through the distribution industry. There is some pride that about Pounds 60m
has already been invested along the M42/A42 corridor. It is not surprising
that the industry should be attracted to Leicestershire; if any county can
claim to be at the hub of the national motorway network Leicestershire can.
But there are problems in this popularity. Distribution parks take up large
amounts of space but they offer employment in relatively small numbers.
Planners argue that it is better to have business parks; not only are there
more jobs there, but also, if high technology industry can be attracted,
there is the hope of future economic growth.
Such an approach is essentially long term. New manufacturing and the
provision of high value-added services do not appear in a day. But in taking
this approach to the question of finding jobs for the growing labour force,
the county has a number of advantages.
Not the least is the trio of universities - Leicester, Loughborough and de
Montfort (formerly Leicester Polytechnic). Arguably the academic-industrial
nexus is stronger in the county than in most other parts of the UK. Mr Alan
Green, chief executive of the Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce, cites the
growth of the design industry: 'More design studios here than in London,' he
claims. 'You can thank the universities for it. Out of them sprang this
industry which gets ignored. They're designing everything from Channel
Tunnel trains to footwear and textiles. They're significant players in
engineering design.'
There will be opportunities further to exploit the marriage of academic and
industrial expertise at Loughborough, where British Gas is building its
research and development centre in what should be the first phase of a new
science park, and in Leicester where a new park close to both Leicester and
de Montfort universities is on the drawing board. At the same time there is
scope for parks, with a bias towards the aerospace industry, at East
Midlands International Airport.
A second advantage the county has is the presence, in Leicester especially,
of an entrepreneurially vigorous Asian community whose tentacles are likely
to spread out beyond the retail economy of the corner shop and the clothing
industry. Indeed, its presence is already marked. Leicester officials
contend that the Asian presence gave the local economy a resilience, during
the recession, which otherwise it would not have had.
A third advantage is the corporate structure: the dependence of the economy
on the proliferation of small and medium sized companies. Historically and
in wider economies, they have provided both the employment growth and the
energy for innovation - precisely the characteristics the county economy
requires.
But the disadvantage for the county is lack of time. Longer term growth of
higher technology industry, accompanied by energetic training programmes,
may well be the answer to the economic future, but the social and economic
problems of, notably, the inner city and old coal mining areas, pour in with
pressing urgency. Hence the local importance attached to Leicester's City
Challenge regeneration programme and to the County Council pleas to the
government and the European Community for funds to assist redevelopment of
the north west of the county.

FT  14 APR 93 / Management: A question of misjudgment - Public relations
setback for Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome should by now be accustomed to public relations crises about its
controversial HIV-treatment AZT. But this month the drugs group was badly
caught on the hop when the UK Medical Research Council called a press
conference about AZT's effectiveness. What happened thereafter is an example
of how even apparently well-prepared companies can mishandle the media and
the stock market.
'The whole business was a great pity from beginning to end,' admits John
Robb, chief executive.
Preliminary details of a Franco-British trial suggesting AZT did not
slow-down the onset of Aids were presented by the MRC on Thursday, April 1.
The conclusion of the trial, if correct, had serious consequences for sales
of the group's second best-selling product. Since the MRC press conference,
Wellcome's shares have fallen 8 per cent.
Wellcome admits it was not ready for the MRC to publish the results. 'We
knew something was going to happen that week in terms of findings, but I
expected a position to be agreed between the MRC and Wellcome,' says Robb.
'And I didn't expect a press release to be sent out without our agreement.'
Robb, together with two US executive directors and Martin Sherwood, head of
public relations, were in the US presenting the company's recent results to
staff and institutions.
'I took the view that our representatives were part of the trial monitoring
committee and that it would be wrong to back out of a visit to US employees
and shareholders,' explains Robb.
Meanwhile, in London, two executive directors were on holiday, leaving the
research and development director, Trevor Jones, virtually alone to cope
with the media. He was supported by John Precious, the recently appointed
finance director, and two press officers. Robb admits the headquarters was
understaffed. Wellcome's external relations machinery was overwhelmed, in
spite of extensive contingency planning and media training.
During the rush for information, the public relations department not only
lacked data to counter the MRC's briefing, but actually gave out inaccurate
information exaggerating the trial's potential damage to AZT's sales.
Press officers said 38 per cent of patients using AZT in the US were
asymptomatic. They concluded that in a disaster scenario the company could
therefore lose 38 per cent of its worldwide AZT sales, worth Pounds 131m for
the first six months to February this year. In fact, the worldwide
percentage of AZT patients who are asymptomatic is between 10 per cent and
15 per cent.
'An internal investigation has been set up to investigate how the 38 per
cent figure was given out, and how expressions such as 'disaster scenario'
were used,' says Robb. The next morning, AZT's apparently disappointing
performance was front-page news. The shares fell 51p to 692p.
'I was dismayed - but not by the share price,' says Robb. 'We are
responsible to the doctors who prescribe the products, our employees and the
patients. For them, the news was devastating.'
Robb and his team returned from New York the following Saturday. They were
convinced the MRC's conclusions were too strongly stated, given
contradictory results from other studies and the preliminary nature of the
trial's data. They thought the results, once properly analysed, would show
the drug was effective.
On Monday last week, Wellcome counter-attacked, calling a combined
conference for Wednesday for the press and analysts, and a later meeting for
Aids activists. The presentations were not a success. The company misjudged
its audience. A technical presentation left attendees, analysts and
journalists, confused. Afterwards, MRC scientists attacked Wellcome's
position, claiming the company had manipulated the data. The group's shares
fell a further 23p. 'We've learned a lot in the last few years, but we still
have some way to go,' says Robb.

FT  14 APR 93 / Management: Laying traps for the poacher - Large
corporations are increasingly enticing employees away from rival companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It has taken General Motors less than a month to introduce 'non-compete'
clauses for key executives in the wake of the dramatic departure of J.
Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua, its worldwide purchasing chief, to Volkswagen.
The one-page agreements, which would normally preclude employees from
working for a competitor for three years from the time of signing, were
approved by the carmaker's board last week.
Lopez's spectacular exit, followed by other less senior GM employees, and
his systematic drive on behalf of his new employer to sign up as many as 40
managers from German rival Opel - a GM subsidiary - will have sent a shudder
down many corporate spines. VW's tactics may have run into opposition in the
German courts - but defences against corporate poaching in other countries
may not be sufficient to discourage an apparently growing practice.
The question in the US is whether GM's efforts to bolster executive loyalty
by legal means will encourage other US corporations to follow suit. Labour
lawyers are sceptical. The basic problem, they say, is that US courts are
supportive of the free flow of labour and that making a 'poaching' case
stick is an uphill legal task.
A second problem has more to do with image. It is not easy to demand
anti-trust enforcement and free trade practices on one hand and then corner
personnel on the other. This is not to say that US companies do not try to
tie executives in by legal as well as financial incentives. 'Non-compete'
clauses have been around for years. But such clauses cannot be overly
onerous - in terms of the length of the non-compete period, or even
geography. One lawyer cites an ongoing legal battle between two Wall Street
investment banks. Action could only be brought, he says, because the
executive in question moved from one New York office to another. Had he
joined a Los Angeles or London office, the case would have been untenable.
That leads on to the thorny issue of what constitutes a 'competing'
situation. Some eyebrows were raised in the airline industry when Frank
Lorenzo, the former boss of Continental Airlines, turned up as an adviser to
MarkAir, a small regional carrier. As part of his deal on leaving
Continental in 1989, Lorenzo had agreed not to work in the airline business
for seven years. Lorenzo's company, Savoy Capital, maintained it was only 'a
consultant' to the newer carrier.
Trade secret suits, or the threat of them, have been a powerful weapon
employed by established high-tech companies ever since Intel initiated such
a move against a rival semiconductor company - Seeq Technology - founded by
10 of its engineers in 1981. For a start-up company, such a legal challenge
can be a serious distraction, eating up management time and limited
financial resources. Rather than risk such suits from their former
employees, would-be entrepreneurs usually try to reach 'gentleman's
agreements' not to compete directly and not to raid their former employer
for staff.
In reality, according to US recruitment consultants, matters such as
poaching tend to be resolved behind the scenes - whatever the formal legal
safeguards. 'There are situations which result in informal conversations,
one CEO to a rival CEO - where one will say cease and desist before I do
something dramatic,' says one Manhattan recruitment professional.
'Dramatic', she adds, non-attributedly, does not mean legal action; between
Wall Street firms it is likely to involve cold-shouldering on syndication
deals.
British employers, meanwhile, use the promise of future rewards and clauses
in employment contracts, to discourage poaching. But in the end neither
method is fail-safe, as no company has a legal right to force anyone to work
for them. Moreover even the heaviest gold handcuffs can be unlocked.
The most generous use of golden handcuffs was to buy the loyalty of
television executives bidding for the ITV franchises in 1991. The estimated
Pounds 60m the companies paid, mainly through share options, was a one-off.
The companies reasoned that to have their top people leave during the
bidding would be disastrous, as it would damage their claims to offer good
programmes.
In addition to share options, companies are increasingly looking to other
long-term incentives, with bonus payments staggered over several years, or
shares in special accounts which are cancelled if the employee leaves the
company.
Companies are increasingly resorting to 'gardening leave' clauses, which
allow them to state that an employee must spend a few months at home before
taking up a new job. The idea is that any confidential information will be
out of date by the time an employee joins a competitor. Other standard
clauses include non-solicitation provisions which prevent departing
employees from taking their colleagues and clients with them when they go.
As none of these clauses have yet been tested in law, it is not clear how
well they will stand up.
In Germany, however, extraordinary precedents are now being set. VW's Lopez
was told earlier this month he could face six months behind bars if he
continued trying 'systematically to recruit' Opel managers.
According to a temporary injunction issued last week, after an appeal by
David Herman, Opel's new chief executive, VW could also be fined up to
DM500,000 (Pounds 208,000).
VW started picking off a select group of new managers last year. The fruits
of the early harvest, brought in at the command of Ferdinand Piech, VW's
boss-elect at the time, include a new CEO at Audi, courtesy of Mercedes and
a production director from Opel's showpiece low-cost works in Eisenach.
Competitors say, Piech was living up to his reputation as a determined
manager with a keen eye for quality people. His recruitment drive was more
wide-reaching than 'normal', but then VW - which scored a DM1.25bn loss in
the three months to April - had more than the normal range of difficulties.
According to Jorg Zauber of Eurosearch Consultants, a Dusseldorf headhunter
with 20 years' experience, the Lopez offensive was 'highly unusual'. But not
as unusual as Opel's bringing its complaints into the public arena and then
to court. It was more common for chief executives to settle their
differences personally in a 'gentlemanly' manner, he says. However, Herman
points out, calls to Piech from Jack Smith, GM's chief executive had proved
fruitless.
Opel turned instead to laws forbidding headhunting which go so far as to
'endanger the existence' of a target company. The common practice of locking
management board directors into five-year contracts is normally enough to
protect the top layer. But as Zauber points out, the usual one-year notice
period required of non-board management is hardly effective. It makes little
sense to hold on to a person who wants to leave.
Herman is unflattered by the tribute, implied in VW's actions, that Opel's
buying and production people are the best in Germany. He is disappointed
that VW, the industry leader, tried to solve its problems at Opel's expense.
The sort of friendly competition among industry leaders for which Herman
evidently yearns created an environment in which poaching traditionally was
not permitted in Japan. But changing economic circumstances have put
increasing pressure on that country's rigid corporate hierarchies, making
Japanese executives more willing to listen to headhunters. Indeed foreign
securities companies have been able to lure senior managers from Japanese
brokerages.
Larger Japanese companies, though, are still reluctant to court their
competitors' employees. The hierarchy remains a formidable obstacle, as
employees look forward to a slow, steady passage up the ladder. Loyalty is
still lauded and the suggestion that a departing executive could take a
roomful of his most trusted aides to a competitor prompts disbelief among
Japanese executives.

FT  14 APR 93 / Jobs: A case of the worst sort of ignorance - Stupidities
that bedevil organisations in defiance of the best knowledge on how to run
them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY study stupidity? The Jobs column has lost count of how many times that
question has been snorted at it in the five weeks since it last mentioned
the Laws of Organisational Stupidity.
The target of the challenges is not the laws themselves, as typified by
Parkinson's First which states: Work expands to fill the time available.
Everybody appears to be agreed that organisations the whole world over are
bedevilled by problems that seem to fall into regularly recurring patterns.
What is under challenge is my claim that such things are a fitting subject
for study in schools of management, which a good many of the questioners
think is somehow philosophically wrong.
They argue that to focus educational attention on the said idiocies would be
to accentuate the negative, whereas the purpose of schools is positive. They
exist to study wise practice, not the ignorant sort, and that applies to
management schools no less than to any others.
Well, perhaps so if we make a certain assumption. It is that the ignorance
leading to organisational stupidities amounts only to some people's failure
to learn the knowledge that exists on how to avoid same, leaving them with a
mental vacuum which could be filled with wisdom the schools possess. But I
suspect the issue is really more complex, as depicted by the old Confucian
jingle.
He who knows, and knows he knows, he is a wise man - seek him.
He who knows, and knows not he knows, he is asleep - wake him.
He who knows not, and knows he knows not, he is a child - teach him.
But he who knows not, and knows not he knows not, he is a fool - shun him.
To my mind, the ignorance giving rise to the idiocies is mainly the last
cited variety, the kind that's ignorant even of the fact that it is
ignorance. It is not the case that management schools are the jingle's wise
men needing simply to awaken sleepers and teach children. The problems
persist in spite of the best knowledge anyone has of how to set up and run
organisations.
Hence all of us, the schools included, are the jingle's fools, which makes
its advice to 'shun' them inapplicable. Unless we're to be bedevilled for
ever, we have to break out of our purblind ignorance.
The only way to do that is to stop proudly confining our educational
attention to what we do know, and start humbly marking out what we don't
know. And the only way to achieve that is to study the observable
consequences as exemplified by the laws. But before proceeding farther, in
case anybody here today was not in the congregation the last time they were
mentioned, I had better again point out an important proviso about their
character.
They aren't like the law of gravity in being inviolable. They both can be
and sometimes are broken, for the most part beneficially. What each one
describes is merely a regularity: a type of unplanned happening seemingly
too frequent to arise purely by chance. In that sense they are akin to
another set of laws that do get studied in management schools - the laws of
economics. Moreover, I wouldn't mind betting that the laws of organisational
stupidity are at least as reliable as predictors of real-life events.
Unfortunately, I haven't room to repeat all of the five I quoted last time.
But since they included the first law formulated by the historian Professor
Northcote Parkinson, who died in his 84th year on March 10, I will begin
today's citations with his second.
In his wording of the 1950s, it states: Expenditure rises to meet income.
But in the light of later history, that might be optimistic. My guess is
that, if tested in practice, the rule would prove to be that expenditure
rises to overtake income.
Whether or not that is so, the law is like the professor's first formulation
in applying to individuals' private lives as well as in organisations -
which is not always the case with the laws of stupidity. But another which
operates at both levels is called Winkler's Twist because it was first
revealed to me, as the laws' self-appointed codifier, by the British
sociologist Jack Winkler. It states: Routine events stimulate only when they
fail to occur.
One illustration of its working is provided by the old mechanical alarm
clock, whose owner slept peacefully while it went on ticking away loudly,
but woke up if it stopped. The selfsame principle nevertheless has numerous
ill effects in organisations, even though they are usually overlooked.
Take for example incremental salary scales which, except for notional
cost-of-living increases, tell employees what their pay is going to be for
each of several years ahead. Since that reduces the future increments to
routine events, Winkler's Twist rules that they cannot be motivating, or at
least not in the positive sense as a reward. The only way to use the
long-expected rises as a motivator is to refuse to pay them over, as a
punishment.
Fairly similar in its workings is the law defined by my FT colleague, Sally
Selby. It too applies generally, albeit in social rather than individual
activity, but has a more specific organisational form with wider bedevilling
potential.
An instance of its general aspect is the game Chinese Whispers in which a
message is given to the first of a line of people, who then each pass what
they think they heard to the next. The usual effect is enshrined by the old
tale of the front-line officer's attempt to get 'Send reinforcements, we're
going to advance' conveyed from mouth to mouth back to headquarters. It
eventually arrived there as 'Send three-and-fourpence, we're going to a
dance.'
But the organisational law, Selby's Scrambler, states specifically that
Myths about a chief's wishes multiply with each link in the chain of
command. The chilling implication, of course, is that even if the said chief
doesn't intend to send any message in the first place, the law is still apt
to do its evil work.
Witness the following incident reported by a big-company middle manager a
while ago to the Harvard Business School's eminent Rosabeth Moss Kanter:
'There are courtiers around the top guys, telling them what they want to
hear, flattering them. For example, there was a luncheon with some board
members. The vice-chairman mentioned that he was looking for a car for his
daughter. A courtier thought: 'We'll take care of it'. He went down the
line, and someone in purchasing had to spend half a day doing this. The guy
who had to do it resented it, so he became antagonistic to the top.
'The vice-chairman had no idea this was going on, and if he had known, he
would probably have stopped it. But you can't say anything at the top
without having it be seen as an order. Even ambiguous remarks may get
translated into action. At the top you have to figure out the impact of all
your words in advance because an innocent expression can have a major
effect.'
The message of same is surely that senior executives need to do more than
recall the experience of Gerald Ratner and keep their talents as
entertaining speakers, no matter how great, firmly under check. It does not
take careless talk to cost millions, and promising careers to boot. The sad
fact is that top bosses cannot avoid the risk even by never saying anything
at all.
For the Scrambler implies that, if there's any question important to lower
rankers on which chiefs may be thought to have an opinion, then however
carefully they refrain from expressing one, myths will rush in to fill the
gap.

FT  14 APR 93 / Improvement in north-east is confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE

EASTER provided further evidence of the upturn in the market in
north-eastern England which estate agents have been aware of for some
months.
Several reported a busier than expected bank holidayMonday but few were
excited about sales.
There was, however, a widespread feeling that the holiday period had
continued the trend of gradual improvement.
'The market is definitely on the up,' said Mr Alan Cooke, Leeds area manager
for Eddisons, part of Property Leeds, the estate agency arm of Leeds
Permanent building society.
He said that at Eddisons' nine offices in Leeds the first week of April was
the best for two to three years, with sales agreed about 50 per cent up on
last year. 'I can definitely see signs that April is going to be the best
selling month we've had for a long time.'
Mr Malcolm Dufton, Property Leeds' Humberside-based northern general
manager, covering 36 offices between Lincoln, Bridlington and the
Yorkshire-Lancashire border, said the company's two best weeks since October
last year were the third week in March and the first week in April.
'It's a progressive groundswell,' he said, but added: 'Everybody is very
jumpy because we've seen things pick up and then fall away.'
Mr Dufton said Easter was a time when possible buyers sought information and
deals followed later.
Mr Peter Miller, a Newcastle-based estate agent and national housing
spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'People
think Easter is a busy time, but it's often a damp squib.' It had been a
reasonable Easter, however, continuing the market's gradual improvement, he
added.
Mr Ian Bebbington, a chartered surveyor with Black Horse Agencies in
Harrogate, where he is also RICS spokesman, was bullish. He said: 'We were
busy with a capital B'
Mr Bebbington, who traced the upturn back to last November, had a hectic day
yesterday, doing seven valuations, five of them requested over Easter by
potential vendors. 'The lower end is still shooting away. We tend to grab as
much of this as we can. Anything under Pounds 60,000 sells very well,' he
said.
At his office, three sales were agreed over Easter. The most expensive had
been on the market for six months.

FT  14 APR 93 / Estate agents bullish about London market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS and RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT greater London estate agents found business disappointing over
the holiday weekend, but there remains a conviction that the local housing
market is showing strong signs of recovery.
Mr John Lindsay, manager of the Sydenham branch of Mann &amp; Co, summed up the
general feeling: 'We had the usual volume over the Easter holiday but it was
quieter than recent weeks, which have been very busy. We usually tend to
hold out great hopes for Easter, only to have them dashed.'
He said the first quarter of the year had seen a lot of activity, with a
local sale every other day compared with one a week a year ago. 'Mortgages
are low, prices are low. The market is ideal for buyers,' he added.
On the Monday bank holiday there were 25 requests for viewings but only five
or six could be arranged immediately because vendors were away.
This is a widespread problem in inner London, particularly in more up-market
areas, as people tend to spend the bank holiday break out of town whether or
not they are selling a house. Most central London estate agents did not open
on Good Friday or Easter Monday.
It was different in the suburbs, because of high activity in shopping
parades, and most local estate agents remained open on Friday, Saturday and
Monday.
Mr Bryce Parkinson, Nationwide branch manager in Croydon, said the weekend
had been reasonably active. 'There is an encouraging level of activity
overall, and hopefully Easter will be a platform for take-off in the rest of
the year. There are now signs of general economic improvement that should
boost people's confidence - we are certainly encouraged, without going over
the top,' he said.
Mr Graham Bogg, a senior negotiator in the Kingston upon Thames office of
Cornerstone Abbey National, said Easter was quiet but there had been
'phenomenal activity' in the area since mid-December. Sales figures had been
50 per cent higher than a year ago.
Mr Jonathan Harvey, a director of Friend &amp; Falcke, an agency covering
Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said Easter had been quiet as many
vendors were on holiday. 'We expect a big increase over the next few weeks,
and we are certainly short of stock in central London.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Easter views dispel south-west's fear of false dawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE south-west the holiday weekend has largely borne out estate agents'
hopes that the recent signs of greater activity in the housing market would
not prove to be a false dawn.
Mr Michael Saunders, managing director of Fulfords, a south Devon chain of
26 offices, said: 'It is safe to say that we have had the busiest Easter
probably for five years.'
The picture varied across the region. Mr Saunders added: 'The general
perception is that we've turned the corner. We have had little peaks before
but it is continuing - and even more encouraging is that we are now selling
mid-range and more expensive houses again.'
One estate agent said it was a myth that Easter was a crucial time for the
property market, but the overall verdict was that the weekend had maintained
the more buoyant trend of the last three months. Agents spoke of prices
firming - especially at the lower end of the market - of a shortage of some
types of property, and of a renewed interest in holiday homes.
Mr John Smith is south-west director of Connells, with 10 offices including
Bristol, Bath, Chippenham and Swindon, which were open for all four days of
the holiday. 'We were very busy and all the signs are that the market is
carrying on as in the previous few months,' he said. Demand earlier in the
year was mostly from first-time buyers, now it was more evenly spread.
Another agent who reported an active Easter was Mr Dowell Conning,
south-west regional operations director of the Royal Life subsidiaries Allen
&amp; Harris and Gribble, Booth &amp; Taylor, which total 80 offices. He said: 'Good
Friday saw an unprecedented demand, certainly in recent times. There was
more interest, offers and positive response. Saturday was brisk but not so
busy.' He added: 'We have moved from amber to amber beige - not exactly 'go'
yet.
'The property market in my region started to decline in August 1988 and I'm
reluctant to sound too optimistic but I think we are now on our way. House
prices quarter on quarter have ceased to fall for the first time in five
years,' he said.
'There's no doubt in my mind that we have had continuous interest for some
time and in another month the market will have its own momentum - we're not
quite there yet.'
Mr Conning said buyers from London were emerging for village properties in
areas such as Devon.

FT  14 APR 93 / Hopes strengthen for housing upturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ESTATE AGENTS are more confident this year that Easter, traditionally the
start of the main house buying season, will confirm evidence of a sustained
recovery in one of the economy's worst-hit sectors.
The National Association of Estate Agents, which represents 10,000 member
companies, said yesterday that there was 'a different feel to the market'
this year after Easter optimism in each of the past two years rapidly turned
sour.
Mr Michael Jones, the association's president, said: 'Many of my colleagues
have had a lot of inquiries, especially from first-time buyers and at new
developments.'
Interest is reported to be strongest in the Midlands, Wales and the north,
but Mr Jones believed that London and the south-east would also 'gradually
feel the effect' of the recovery.
Estate agents and mortgage lenders announced figures which they claimed
proved the market was on the move after three years in the doldrums.
Royal Life Estates, which has nearly 500 estate agencies throughout the
country, said new instructions - a seller putting a property on the market -
and sales subject to contract were both up by a fifth in the last quarter.
Contracts exchanged were up by 40 per cent.
Mr Roger Hicklin, business development director, said: 'We are very cautious
about saying the worst is over, but the longer we have some stability with a
gentle upward trend in prices, then the more will confidence return.'
Abbey National, the country's second-largest mortgage lender, said mortgage
applications had doubled since March last year. Most of that rise had come
in the past three months, with a surge of 60 per cent between February and
March. At the same time the number of first-time buyers entering the market
had now risen to nearly 50 per cent of the total.
Halifax building society insisted there was 'no dramatic surge' in its 500
estate agencies over the weekend but there had been 'a healthy level' of
interest and inquiries.

FT  14 APR 93 / Aids directs attention to condom market: The background to
the latest MMC inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is preparing a report on the UK's
condom market, which is worth about Pounds 45m at retail prices, due for
publication by the end of this year.
The last MMC inquiry into the market - in 1982 - introduced a complicated
price-control system requiring calculations abstruse enough to confound the
keenest market analyst.
What the 1993 investigation will find is a market radically altered by the
impact of Aids, and yet largely unchanged in terms of the companies which
dominate production.
In 1982 the biggest seller by far - with about 95 per cent of the market -
was the Durex brand. Durex, produced by LRC Products, part of London
International Group (LIG), still has the largest share of the market - 75
per cent, worth almost Pounds 34m at retail prices. Mates Healthcare, owned
by the Australian corporation Ansell, is the second-largest brand, with
about 20 per cent.
Two other brands have recently made minor inroads into the UK market. Sagami
Rubber, a Japanese company, entered the market in August 1991 with the
launch of the Le Condom brand, which was already a leading brand in
continental Europe.
The Jiffi brand, owned by Sime International, the world's largest rubber
company, was relaunched in August last year.
All kinds of marketing techniques have been used to try to break the Durex
grip, ranging from Mates' early advertising attempts to remove the
embarrassment factor, to Jiffi's producing condoms flavoured with banana,
lemon, orange, strawberry, chocolate cocktail and pina colada. Durex and
Mates have set up educational campaigns with leaflets, posters and sampling
aimed at 'safer sex' counselling but also with the marketing spin-off of
gaining brand awareness.
Condom sales stood at about 152m annually last year, 20 per cent up on the
1987 figure, when the government first began promoting condoms as part of
its 'safer sex' advertising campaign. Between 1980 and 1986 about 112m were
sold annually, with the real boost coming from the Aids scare. In 1988 sales
soared to about 140m.
Total advertising expenditure to support all brands jumped from Pounds
173,000 in 1986 to Pounds 1.53m in 1987 and Pounds 1.87m in 1988 - when
television advertising was first approved - but by 1991 had fallen back to
Pounds 346,000.
Of that 1991 figure, by far the largest chunk was spent on Mates (Pounds
260,000), with Sagami's Le Condom accounting for the balance.
In 1982 the MMC concluded that LRC's domination of the market operated
against the public interest 'in that its prices might be expected to become
excessive'. In response, LRC undertook to limit the growth in its average
realised price (calculated by dividing its total UK turnover by the total UK
volume) to 1.5 per cent below an index of costs.
On the face of it the 1982 MMC inquiry did nothing to alter Durex's monopoly
position, defined by the 1973 Fair Trade Act as existing if 'one person or
company supplies or is supplied with at least one quarter of the goods of a
particular description in the UK or any part of it.'
So why the inquiry now? Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair
trading, outlined the reasons on March 1 when he recommended the inquiry in
the light of a market vastly changed by the Aids threat. He said: 'I shall
be particularly interested in the MMC's view on the way in which the price
control mechanism has been applied and whether this has damaged the prospect
of successful competition from Mates and other suppliers'.
In other words, the OFT appears to have tacitly admitted that, far from
operating in the public's interest, the 1982 price-control mechanism may
have stifled competition, precisely when consumers may have been most eager
for greater choice.
LIG is putting a brave front on the latest MMC inquiry, in spite of its
unofficial acknowledgement that the price-control mechanism - which reading
between Sir Bryan's lines, looks set to be scrapped - has worked in its
favour and against its competitors.
One LIG executive said: 'De facto they are as controlled as we are on their
prices. They certainly can't charge more than we can. We think our
competitors will be as anxious to wriggle off the price hook as anybody.'
The condom business is quintessentially about branding and for many Durex is
synonymous with condoms. Bound up with that, particularly in this market, is
consumer need for reassurances about safety and reliability.
The MMC inquiry may decide to remove price controls, but that will not
necessarily bring down prices consumers pay nor will it necessarily make it
any easier for new competitors to enter the market.
An industry analyst said: 'The barriers to entry are not great, it is not
expensive to establish a factory producing condoms in the Far East.
'But you are talking about a fairly unique product, people are not happy
lingering around the counter, arguing over price or brands. They tend to see
the familiar product and make a lunge for it.'

FT  14 APR 93 / BR talks fail to avert rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL chairman Sir Bob Reid last night warned railway unions that
more strikes would result in job cuts and lost business.
But his talks with union leaders failed to lift the threat of another
24-hour strike on Friday, although Sir Bob invited the union officials to
return for discussions today.
The BR chairman told the RMT, the main rail union, that it risked causing
severe damage to the industry if it went ahead with the stoppage.
He told RMT general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp: 'Jobs are threatened if there
are further strikes. Strikes damage our reputation at a time when we are
trying to get freight off the road and on to the rail.'
Sir Bob spent nearly three hours with union leaders trying to reassure them
that their anxieties about possible future compulsory redundancies were
groundless.
'We made it clear there can be no question of jobs for life but also there
will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of contracting out work,' he
said.
He added that he had explained to officials from the RMT and the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU) - who have
members in the rail repair yards - the proposed timetable for rail
privatisation and how it would work.
Mr Knapp said Friday's strike was still going ahead as planned and that much
more work needed to be done on the issues in contention.
Even if the RMT and the CSEU accepted BR's assurances this would not end the
prospect of a shutdown of the whole network on Friday.
Aslef, the drivers' union, also plans to strike then over a separate issue.
It wants BR to guarantee existing national agreements over the deployment of
drivers in the transition to privatisation.

FT  14 APR 93 / Manufacturing output prices remain steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving factories rose only marginally last
month, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that output prices rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in March compared with February. The
year-on-year rate of increase was unchanged at 3.7 per cent.
The slackness of price rises was highlighted further by the very small rise
in output prices excluding food, drink and tobacco. This index - which gives
a better picture of underlying trends - rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per
cent month-on-month and 2.6 per cent compared with the same month a year
ago.
The CSO estimated that excise-duty changes in the Budget added about 0.2 per
cent to the output price index last month, compared with 0.4 per cent for
March last year.
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations and suggest that
manufacturers remain reluctant to pass on the higher costs of raw materials
to other industries and retailers.
Input prices - mainly raw materials and fuels - continued to rise. On an
unadjusted basis they rose 0.1 per cent last month, taking the year-on-year
rate of increase to 8.3 per cent, the highest level since July 1987.
The latest rise compares with 7.2 per cent in the year to February and
suggests that the effects of sterling's devaluation in September are still
coming through, with imported materials accounting for about 60 per cent of
manufacturers' raw material costs. Seasonally adjusted, the input prices
index rose 0.5 per cent month-on-month.
Many economists expect input prices to continue rising for the rest of the
year although a stronger pound should slow the upward movement.
Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS, the investment bank, said: 'While
sterling should enjoy a mild appreciation in the second half of the year, a
sustained rise in commodity prices should push up input prices.'
The CSO said rises in the prices of food materials were largely offset by
seasonal falls in the costs of electricity to industrial consumers.
A breakdown shows that the sharpest increases in input prices have been in
petroleum products, and food manufacturing materials. In the year to March
prices of petroleum products rose 16.7 per cent, while imported food
manufacturing materials rose 14.2 per cent.

FT  14 APR 93 / On-shore gas to fuel power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH POWER is to build a power station in North Yorkshire to be fuelled
by what it says is Britain's largest on-shore sour gas field.
Sour gas contains a significant amount of hydrogen sulphide and is normally
unsuitable for household use.
The 40MW to 50MW power station will generate enough power to provide
electricity for a town of 15,000 people.
Although small by comparison with other electricity plants, the station will
underline the growing use of gas in power generation and the problems that
causes for coal.
The station is being built at Knapton in the Vale of Pickering between
Scarborough and York.
The gas - about 10m cubic feet daily - is being supplied by contract from
Kelt UK in association with Edinburgh Oil and Gas, Marinex Exploration and
Tullow Exploration.
Output from the station will be connected to the national grid through
Northern Electric's high-voltage system.
The Department of Trade and Industry has granted planning permission for the
project. Work will start within two months with completion expected in 1995.
It has been agreed that if Kelt finds more gas in the area Scottish Power
will have rights to its use.

FT  14 APR 93 / Private cash for NHS 'welcome'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is examining ways of expanding the role of private financing
in the National Health Service as a means of improving the service provided
to NHS patients.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said yesterday she would
'welcome' private-sector involvement in NHS projects - providing the service
benefited.
'We should not have a kind of apartheid between public and private sector,'
she said. 'Where private-sector skills, resources and capital can help us to
go forward, then I welcome it.'
Her remarks - given on BBC Radio's The World at One programme - followed the
publication of a paper on opportunities for using private finance in the NHS
by Mr David Willetts, a backbench Tory MP and former member of the Downing
Street policy unit.
The paper says hospitals should be free to use private-sector funding to
finance new facilities. It says liberalisation of the Department of Health's
current capital control procedures would be a 'crucial' first step in giving
private providers the opportunity to tender for new NHS developments.
Mrs Bottomley said the NHS had already worked with the private sector on a
range of projects, such as the government's initiative to reduce waiting
lists. Other opportunities for private involvement existed 'in a rather
tentative form'.
Separately, the Department of Health said the government was keen to see
innovative ideas proposed for bringing new funds into the health service but
would 'never go down the road so far as Mr Willetts has suggested'.
For Labour, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the ideas
contained in the paper did nothing to tackle the central problem of health
service underfunding.

<TEXT>
MANAGERS OF Group 4 Court Services will meet Prison Service officials
tomorrow to discuss the problems which arose during the first week of
Britain's only private prison-escort service.
Four prisoners escaped or were wrongly released last week, when Group 4 took
over the contract for escorting prisoners between prisons and courts in the
east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside.
Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service, will seek an
explanation for the incidents and stress the importance of Group 4 meeting
the quality requirements of its five-year contract.
Group 4 said that it looked forward to tomorrow's meeting. The company was
satisfied that there were adequate explanations for the incidents and said
it was 'entirely happy that the basic principles of the operation are
sound.'
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, is to raise the issue of private
court-escort services in the Commons.

FT  14 APR 93 / Ethics guidance for accountancy firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will be required to provide more information to their
successors when a client changes advisers, according to draft guidelines
issued yesterday.
The revised guidance on changes in professional appointments comes from the
Chartered Accountants Joint Ethics Committee, which represents the three
chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and Ireland.
It stresses that firms must provide minimum accounting information to a
successor even if disputes over fees remain outstanding.
The revised guidelines also emphasise that a change in a continuing
appointment is to be treated in the same way as a change in auditors. The
information a new firm should be told includes: reasons for a change;
disputes with the client over principle or practice; and any unlawful acts
or suspicions of fraud.

FT  14 APR 93 / Maastricht may face fresh delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH COMPLICATIONS that could prolong the tortuous process of ratifying the
Maastricht treaty emerged last night as MPs began returning to Westminster
after the Easter recess.
With the Commons resuming detailed consideration of the Maastricht bill
tomorrow, Labour said it was still confident of forcing a vote on its
potentially crucial amendment removing the protocol containing Britain's
opt-out from the treaty's social chapter.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said there was a powerful case
for a vote on the amendment 'at some stage'.
If Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker who chairs the detailed discussion,
sticks to his decision not to allow a vote on the amendment during the
committee stage, the argument for allowing one in the subsequent report
stage could be strengthened, Labour believes.
Mr Cunningham has written to Mr Morris requesting a meeting today to discuss
the matter. Mr Morris has received separate submissions from the Liberal
Democrats and Tory Euro-sceptics.
With the committee stage nearing its conclusion, some people are predicting
a series of government defeats tomorrow on non-wrecking Labour amendments to
increase the accountability to parliament of EC institutions. The likelihood
of this receded significantly last month, however, after the Liberal
Democrats decided not to support the amendments.
Meanwhile, some Tory Euro-sceptics were apparently edging towards supporting
a separate Labour clause to prevent powers being transferred under the bill
until MPs had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK.
With the Liberal Democrats set to back the new clause, the support of the 20
to 25 hard-core rebels would all but assure the government of an
embarrassing defeat. But the clause would only force the government to
choose between ratifying the treaty and accepting the social chapter if Tory
rebels voted for the chapter in the subsequent debate.
One Euro-sceptic yesterday predicted that more than 20 rebels were likely to
support the clause. In a separate move, seven Labour Euro-sceptics have
tabled five new non-wrecking amendments in a fresh bid to delay
ratification.

FT  14 APR 93 / Rush to join the Securities Institute: Number of
applications far exceeds estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY and RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISINGLY high number, some 8,500 people, applied to join the new
Securities Institute during its first year of operation to March 31, far
exceeding the internal target of 5,500.
The institute's chief executive, Mr Tim Nicholson, said: 'There has been a
wall of application forms.'
It appears that about 3,500 applications flooded in during the final few
weeks as City securities industry professionals sought to take last-minute
advantage of a 'window of opportunity'.
Established practitioners applying up to March 31 were offered membership on
the basis only of regulatory checks and, in some cases, interviews. Full
membership will now only be granted to those who pass examinations lasting
nine hours.
The institute was set up last year after the Stock Exchange ended its
facility for personal membership. Its aim is to promote professional
standards and ethics, which have been under pressure in the securities
industry is some respects since the Stock Exchange's 'Big Bang' in 1986.
Members may adopt the initials MSI on business cards and letterheads.
About 4,600 applications have come from the 5,000 former members of the
Stock Exchange. The nearly 4,000 other applications suggests the new
association will embrace a wider professional community.
The institute was successful in attracting interest from practitioners in
areas such as investment management, corporate finance and futures trading.
Individuals from many national and regional law firms have applied, along
with accountancy and investment bankers, including some from Hill Samuel and
Samuel Montagu.
'The securities trade has always lacked an effective focal point,' said Mr
Nicholson. 'We are bridging the gap and the trade is responding. We have the
Law Society and Institute of Chartered Accountants, now the securities
industry is getting the representation it deserves.'
Unqualified applicants hoping to gain membership before examinations become
compulsory faced a torrid time negotiating the rigorous admissions criteria.
A strict membership system will include an eight-page application form,
detailed references from institute members or the directors of the
applicant's firm, and thorough regulatory checks.
Mr Nicholson accepts there will be some disreputable applicants: 'We will be
looking for individuals with substance. Almost half of these 'outside'
applicants will be interviewed to check their credentials.'
With headquarters next to the Monument in the City, the institute is forming
18 branches in the UK and offshore.

FT  14 APR 93 / Political Notebook: The view from the trenches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS back to the trenches. MPs returning to Westminster today after the
Easter break will find the contours of the battlefield have scarcely
changed. The Commons battle over the Maastricht treaty and the economy's
slow emergence from recession will continue to shape the political
landscape.
The next three months, parliament's summer term, will be no less critical
for that. They should show whether retreat has become a way of life for Mr
John Major's government. They should reveal whether Mr John Smith's Labour
party can find ammunition more lethal than the worthy respectability of its
leader.
Between now and July the prime minister must make up his mind whether to
give a fresh face to a weary-looking government with an extensive cabinet
reshuffle. Mr Smith must decide whether a solid public image and a sharp
Commons debating style provide sufficient substitute for the radicalism
demanded by some of his colleagues.
There will be a chance for the electorate to give their interim judgment.
Some 25m adults are eligible to vote in next month's county council
elections. In Newbury Mr Major will face the first by-election of the
parliament.
The local and by-election results will be brushed aside by the losers as
inconsequential to the long-term political fortunes of the participants. But
the results will have an important impact on the psychology of the
politicians.
A government as battered as the present one cannot lose in its electoral
heartland and expect its already ragged backbenchers to keep their nerve. Mr
Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have drifted on the sidelines since last
April. A strong showing in the local polls and victory in Newbury would put
them back in the political fight.
Everything hinges on Maastricht, of course. The return of the Maastricht
legislation to the Commons tomorrow will mark the opening of the final
chapter in this particular saga. No-one can predict with certainty the
denouement.
Ministers are upbeat. About 90 per cent of the hundreds of proposed
amendments have now been debated. Most of the government's other
legislation, including hefty bills on education, employment and leasehold
reform have been dealt with. Assuming that the Danes vote 'Yes' in their
second referendum next month, the odds are that the treaty will be ratified
by the end of July.
Mr Major cannot rest easy. His party's fifth columnists have become totally
detached from his leadership in their opposition to the treaty. There
remains a small but real chance that the arcane procedures of the Commons
may facilitate an amendment to incorporate the social chapter. If that
happened for the prime minister all would be lost.
The mood over Europe - and most else - will in turn be conditioned by the
economy. The Treasury is convinced that recovery is under way. Disgruntled
Conservative MPs want to see the green shoots flower before deciding that
the government has restored a grip on economic management.
As with Maastricht, Mr Major cannot afford to be wrong this time. No-one
expects recession to be followed by boom. But without strong and steady
confirmation of recovery he cannot begin to restore his authority.
The economy colours everything. With recovery underway the latest dispute
over testing in schools is likely to prove awkward but manageable. If the
economic indicators turn down again, the row could spark yet another
backbench rebellion.
There are other potential minefields. Unemployment is still rising. This
summer's public-spending round will be bloodier than most realise. The
fundamental review of Whitehall budgets being undertaken by Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary, will remind Tory MPs how much easier it is to
talk about saving public money than it is to do it.
So there will be no shortage of targets for the opposition parties. And yet
Labour MPs are far from reassured. Mr Smith has a notional opinion poll lead
of 15 points but this appears to owe much more to the government's
unpopularity than to positive enthusiasm for a Labour alternative.
Mr Smith, a cautious, patient man cannot wait indefinitely before defining
that alternative. He must make up his mind about electoral reform, about his
party's links with the trades unions, and about the balance in its policies
between egalitarianism and individual opportunity.
Until then Labour, like the Tories, cannot expect to break out from its
trenches.

FT  14 APR 93 / Bristol prison facilities criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CARE of seriously disturbed inmates at Bristol prison remained
'dangerous and unacceptable' in spite of redevelopment work after riots
three years ago, Judge Stephen Tumim, chief inspector of prisons, said
yesterday.
More than Pounds 1m of damage was caused at Bristol during the riots that
swept British jails in the spring of 1990. The prison has since been
renovated at a cost of Pounds 3.5m.
In his latest report Judge Tumim says little appears to have changed apart
from the redevelopment work.
He refers to 'considerable achievements' in repairing the riot damage and
building relationships between prisoners and staff but says Bristol remains
a 'busy, overcrowded prison offering few facilities for inmates'.
The government says measures have already been taken to meet many of the
recommendations in Judge Tumim's report.

THERE are no signs of any real recovery in the British printing industry,
according to the quarterly survey by the British Printing Industries
Federation. Only 10 per cent of its sample of companies enjoyed an
improvement in their trading conditions between mid-December and mid-March,
compared with 34 per cent who had expected them to be better.
The survey says: 'There have been too many false dawns and withered green
shoots to allow printers to be positively cheerful. Companies are chary too,
simply because they can detect little in the way of real confidence among
their customers or in the economy at large.'
The federation survey concludes that most printers are prepared to believe
the worst of the recession is behind them. It adds: 'They hope but are less
than confident that recovery is under way and sure that, even if the economy
is improving, it is doing so slowly and unevenly.'
A total of 68 per cent of companies thought the printing business would
improve over the next three months compared with 24 per cent which thought
it would stay the same and 8 per cent which thought it would grow worse.
More than half the printing industry has cut its workforce over the past
three months and a quarter expect further reductions up to June. The report
adds: 'Recruitment is at a standstill in larger companies and confined to a
minority among small and medium-sized printers.' Even with the reduction in
the workforce 84 per cent of the industry is still suffering from surplus
capacity, compared with 73 per cent in December.
But the survey found smaller and medium-sized firms happier with their order
books than larger ones with half reporting them to be normal or better than
normal.

FT  14 APR 93 / EBRD defends spending on HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday defended the
spending on its offices. It said it had obtained 'value for money', Robert
Peston writes.
It was responding to a report in the Financial Times that it had spent
Pounds 55.5m on fitting out its new office and Pounds 18m on its previous
office, of which Pounds 40m had been provided by the British government.
The EBRD said: 'The bank needed a headquarters building that was suitable to
its needs as an international public institution with 23 resident
directorships representing 56 members.'
From April 1991 until the end of last year, the EBRD disbursed Pounds 101m
in loans compared with Pounds 201.5m spent on furnishing and equipping its
offices, paying staff, travel and administrative overheads. The bank said
that by the end of March disbursements had increased by Pounds 56m. It had
also 'committed' more than Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) to projects.
It added: 'The bank is proud of its record in central and eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union which it has achieved in difficult circumstances.'
The Treasury yesterday said that the control of expenditure at the EBRD was
'a matter for the bank itself and its board of directors'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, is pressing Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, for an explanation of why so much was spent on the new offices.
But the Treasury said: 'The control of expenditure by the EBRD is not a
matter for the UK government.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Patten likely to escape probe into schools row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, last night appeared likely to avoid
an embarrassing Commons inquiry into his clash with teachers over the
national curriculum and school testing.
In a move that may signal an ebbing of Tory anxiety, one of Mr Patten's
fiercest critics, Sir Malcolm Thornton, Conservative chairman of the Commons
education committee, denied suggestions that he favoured MPs launching an
investigation. 'There seems to be no purpose in having an inquiry unless we
can do something positive to help the situation,' he said - but added that
he still wanted the scrapping of tests planned for this summer.
Sir Malcolm's comments came as other Tory committee members backed Mr
Patten's refusal to heed teachers' calls for the suspension until 1994 of
this summer's tests.
Mr Robert Spink, Tory MP for Castle Point, said he had been 'astounded' to
hear hints from Sir Malcolm over the Easter weekend that the committee might
launch an inquiry. The tests for 14-year-olds were urgently needed. 'I don't
think that we can delay another year,' he said.
Mrs Angela Knight, Tory MP for Erewash, said: 'If you say that we are not
going to have tests this year, after a three-year programme, how many
children are going to go out of school without necessary skills?'
Mr Patten has been helped by a growing consensus among Tories that the
teachers' unions have proved themselves largely politically motivated. But
he still faces widespread concern at Westminster.
Labour MPs on the education committee will probably urge a fresh inquiry
when it meets today, and many Tory MPs remain worried about Mr Patten's
uncompromising attitude towards the teachers. One Tory said: 'He has
misjudged it. He doesn't appear to be listening to the teachers and that is
not working to his advantage.'
Mr Patten will address the Tory backbench education committee soon - where
support is likely to be mixed. Mr Alan Haselhurst, committee vice-chairman,
said: 'I think that the party would be solidly behind what he is trying to
do. But they would be worried about implementation in the circumstances that
have arisen.'
Sir Rhodes Boyson, Conservative MP for Brent North, said: 'I'm backing John
Patten. At the same time, John Patten must say much more clearly that the
national curriculum has is to be cut back and the tests made much simpler.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Tactics reviewed in blackboard battle: A look at plans to
proceed with tests despite boycott threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RON Dearing, chairman designate of the School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, yesterday moved to the centre of the political row over testing
in schools by urging teachers not to boycott the tests.
He has to conduct the review of the curriculum that was announced last week
by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, as a concession to opposition
which had already been voiced by several teachers' unions.
Sir Ron's argument, which the government endorsed, was that he would not be
able to produce improvements in the tests without evidence from this year.
He said: 'One of the jobs I have been given is to look at the manageability
of the whole thing. I need some tests this summer to show me how the thing
is working.'
This is part of a more emollient approach the government has adopted to
persuade parents and more moderate teachers that a boycott would be
counter-productive. The Department for Education said yesterday a boycott
would 'hinder the review, which teachers presumably want', and that Mr
Patten had started the review 'as a result of meeting with teachers'.
The department said concessions had already been made by the decision not to
make the results of this year's tests public, and to initiate the review.
These concessions appear to have won over Mr Patten's strongest critics
among Tory MPs. The department also says that tests for seven-year-olds,
greeted with criticism by teachers when they were introduced, were now
working successfully.
Mr Patten's hope is that these arguments can win over parents and the more
moderate teachers. This would then allow teachers who went through with
boycotting to be portrayed as unprofessional or politically motivated.
Reaction to Sir Ron's appeal from teachers and parents has so far been
patchy, however. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the traditionally
moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which is balloting its
members on a boycott of the tests, met Sir Ron last night - the first
teachers' union representative to do so.
He called on the assessment authority to demonstrate its independence by
reviewing the curriculum in its entirety. He said: 'John Patten's
announcement of a review in the national curriculum is welcome because
everyone accepts that it has become excessively complex. Where Mr Patten's
got it wrong is that he's announced a review of the component elements of
the curriculum, rather than a review of the totality of it.'
Mr Smith wants to see the curriculum slimmed down drastically. But he also
wants to avoid a protracted political argument. He said: 'If we get a sort
of stand-off like we had in the mid-1980s with Mr Patten slinging mud at the
teachers and teachers slinging mud at Mr Patten, that's a cul-de-sac.'
Other union leaders held out less hope of compromise. Mr Nigel De Gruchy,
general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers, described Sir Ron's argument as 'incredibly weak'. He said
proceeding with the tests this year was unnecessary because 'there are
mountains of data available showing they are imposing this crippling burden
on teachers and distracting from teachers' ability to teach properly in the
classroom. We need a simple suspension of the whole system.'
Mr De Gruchy took issue with the department's claims that tests for
seven-year-olds, which the NASUWT also intends to boycott, had been
successful, saying primary school teachers still found 'huge workload
problems' and continued to question the tests' educational value.
Parents' associations also seem unimpressed by Sir Ron's arguments. Ms
Margaret Morrissey, of the National Confederation of Parent Teachers'
Associations, said: 'Parents do not see why their children should go through
with these tests just so Sir Ron Dearing should have some background.'
Mr Patten's attempts to court parents appear to have been damaged by his
widely publicised description of the NCPTA as 'Neanderthal', and by his
sudden cancellation of a meeting he had planned to hold with it last week.

FT  14 APR 93 / Domestic air travel shows increase of 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC AIR travel showed its sharpest rise for more than a year during
March, indicating greater confidence among UK businesses which buy most of
the tickets for internal flights.
The latest traffic figures from BAA, which operates London's airports and
three in Scotland, show a 5.5 per cent year-on-year increase in domestic
passenger traffic.
The last time such a rise was recorded, in February last year, it was
attributed to a bounce back from the depressed figures of two years ago in
the aftermath of the Gulf war. Without the Gulf war effect, March showed the
biggest rise since August 1990.
The recovery in traffic echoes mild optimism in some quarters of the airline
industry. Many airlines operating across the North Atlantic, for example,
have increased capacity by more than 10 per cent for the summer season.
BAA's former chairman Sir Norman Payne believes the traffic growth on the
busy London-Edinburgh route closely fitted the trend in Britain's gross
domestic product.
But British Airways damped hopes that domestic traffic was recovering
sharply. It said the domestic travel business was 'still broadly depressed'.
Traffic from BAA airports to the rest of Europe increased more quickly than
domestic traffic, rising 9.6 per cent over March 1992.
The upward trend has been established for many months but may also be a
reflection of increased business done as a result of the European Community
single market which began on January 1.
Much of the gain was at the expense of short-haul charter traffic, down 4.2
per cent. This may have been a consequence of the modest fare cuts that some
of Europe's scheduled airlines introduced in the wake of the EC's partial
liberalisation of air traffic.
Stansted, London's loss-making third airport, continued to struggle to
establish itself as an alternative to Heathrow and Gatwick. While passenger
traffic grew by 5.7 per cent, the number of aircraft take-offs fell 8.3 per
cent.
Robert Taylor writes: There are no signs of any real recovery in the British
printing industry, according to the quarterly survey by the British Printing
Industries Federation. Only 10 per cent of its sample of companies enjoyed
an improvement in their trading conditions between mid-December and
mid-March, compared with 34 per cent who had expected them to be better.
The survey says: 'There have been too many false dawns and withered green
shoots to allow printers to be positively cheerful. Companies are chary too,
simply because they can detect little in the way of real confidence among
their customers or in the economy at large.'

TWO-WAY trade between the European Community and its eastern neighbours must
not falter because of recession in western Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, EC
trade commissioner, said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber in Copenhagen.
He was speaking at a conference on economic development in central and
eastern Europe organised by the Danish government.
But Bulgarian, Czech and Hungarian delegations from among the 30 countries
present complained that EC promises of more liberal trade jarred with the
EC's one-month ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products
from across eastern Europe.
Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign minister, said the embargo was
'entirely unwarranted' and 'it smacks of a most regretable survival of the
notion of an eastern bloc'.
Sir Leon avoided reference to the ban, but spoke of 'misguided perception'
that western industries needed special protection from artificially
privatised state companies in eastern Europe. 'This approach is as disloyal
to our eastern European partners as it is to the facts.'
He himself was isolated within the Commission earlier this year when he
appealed for a more generous approach to trade with eastern Europe, but he
won some concessions from member states. Yesterday he promised to use the
EC's anti-dumping measures only against 'genuine breaches' of multilateral
trading standards.
According to a draft of the conference's final commnique, the EC and Efta
pledge to open up markets progressively, but only on a 'mutually
advantageous basis'. It also urges the east European countries to re-inforce
trade relations between themselves and the former Soviet Union.
The EC runs a trade surplus of Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 860m) with Hungary,
Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech and Slovak republics.

FT  14 APR 93 / US carmakers win patent: Breakthrough for pooled research
effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the three US carmakers, have been awarded
their first joint patent in a breakthrough for the industry's pooled
research and development effort launched in 1988.
The three companies have embarked on several joint R&amp;D programmes, which
only a few years ago would have been illegal under antitrust laws, in an
attempt to gain a competitive edge over Japanese rivals.
The patent has been awarded for a new process for producing vehicle
components from liquid-moulded composites, which could replace the use of
steel in the interior body structure of some vehicles.
Mr Don Walkowicz, executive director of the US Council for Automotive
Research (Uscar), said the patent was a milestone for the industry's R&amp;D
effort. 'It clearly demonstrates that domestic auto manufacturers can work
together effectively to develop basic technology that will lead to better,
more efficient products and enhance the competitiveness of the US industry.'
Uscar was formed last year to co-ordinate the carmakers' co-operative R&amp;D
programmes. The council now has 10 separate R&amp;D consortia covering areas
such as vehicle composites, advanced battery research, occupant safety, low
emissions technologies, vehicle recycling, and computer-aided design and
manufacturing.
The patent awarded yesterday was granted to Uscar's automotive composites
consortium. Mr John Fillion, chairman of the consortium and manager of
organic material engineering at Chrysler, said the patented process would
help reduce the overall weight of composite components and could improve
fuel economy.

THE Trinidad and Tobago dollar fell 26 per cent against the US dollar
yesterday when currency markets reopened following a government announcement
that the currency was being floated.
The rate, which has been fixed at 4.25 to the US dollar since 1989, is being
determined by commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange dealers,
according to Mr Wendell Mottley, finance minister.
The central bank said foreign reserves were 'under pressure because of debt
servicing obligations and flight of capital' from the country. 'As long as
the reserves remain low, and as long as economic activity and business
confidence continues to be depressed, there will be speculation about a
possible devaluation, leading in turn to capital flight,' it said. An
average USDollars 200m in capital left Trinidad and Tobago every year
between 1986 and 1991, it added.
The Caribbean republic's economy is 70 per cent dependent on its petroleum
industry. Foreign debt stands at USDollars 2.29bn.
Yesterday's exchange rate was agreed in advance by the government and the
commercial banks, and was set slightly above that prevailing on the growing
unofficial foreign currency market.
Bankers said yesterday that they expected fluctuations in the exchange rate
later this week when levels of supply and demand became clear.
Mr Terrence Farrell, deputy governor of the central bank, said: 'What one is
striving for is a regime that is flexible, with the rate moving from day to
day, from week to week, but that generally, the rate will be moving to what
I call a zone of stability.'
There would not be 'wild and large fluctuations' as happened in other
countries, he said.

A LABOUR dispute at an Ontario factory owned by Nestle, the Swiss food and
beverage group, has underlined the pressures on Canadian manufacturers and
their workers to adjust to a more competitive trading environment in north
America.
Nestle locked out 220 union members at the factory near Ottawa after they
refused to agree to more flexible working hours. The factory's main products
are instant coffee and Quik flavoured powders.
Lower tariffs under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement have helped
boost the plant's exports to 70 per cent of output. However, Nestle has
excess instant-coffee capacity in its US and Canadian plants and is seeking
to rationalise production. Workers at its two US factories have accepted the
arrangements being resisted by the Canadians.
Nestle also has a coffee plant in Mexico. Production is geared entirely to
the domestic market for the time being, with exports discouraged by customs
duties in the US and Canada. However, tariffs between all three countries
will be phased out if the North American Free Trade Agreement comes into
force as scheduled next January.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S former president, Mr Fernando Collor, has denied involvement in an
alleged attempt to bribe the attorney general into dropping criminal charges
against him, according to Brazilian television, Reuter reports from Braslia.
Mr Collor gave a 15-minute deposition before a federal judge on Monday, the
O Globo television programme reported. A businessman, Mr Wanderley de
Oliveira, has been charged in the case. 'I've never even seen the man', O
Globo quoted the ex-president as saying outside the hearing room. The
proceedings were closed to the press.
Mr de Oliveira is alleged to have attempted to offer Dollars 50m to Mr
Aristides Junqueira, attorney general, last November to drop criminal
charges against Mr Collor while he was still president.
Mr Junqueira has charged Mr Collor with passive corruption and forming a
criminal group as part of an alleged influence-peddling scheme. He faces
trial before the Supreme Court.
The attorney general has claimed in interviews that Mr de Oliveira had told
one of his aides the money was being put up by 'persons employed to defend
Collor'. Mr Collor, 43, resigned at the start of his Senate impeachment
trial in December and was replaced by his vice-president, Mr Itamar Franco.
Mr Collor's wife Rosane had also been due to make a statement to the hearing
on Monday about charges that she used government money in 1991 to pay for a
lavish party for her personal secretary.

FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Moscow 'needs own Marshall plan' - The
ECE, a UN body, has put the stress on long-term aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC aid for Russia must address the country's underlying problems of
monetary instability and structural change, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe says in its annual economic survey* published today.
The ECE calls on the G7 nations, whose finance and foreign ministers will
discuss aid to Russia as the main agenda item at their meeting in Tokyo
today, to commit themselves to a long-term reform programme on the scale of
the post-war Marshall plan that channelled billions of dollars of US aid
into the economic reconstruction of western Europe.
'One of the worst outcomes would be . . . a list of short-term measures,
hastily put together with a maximum of publicity,' the ECE says, warning
against another 'false start' on the road to Russian reform.
The ECE, which groups almost all the countries of western and eastern
Europe, the US and Canada, also urges western governments not to neglect
other eastern European countries in their concern for Russia. A broader,
regional perspective of the transition to market-based economies is needed,
the report says.
The UN body has consistently argued that western aid for eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union has failed to grasp the long-term dimensions of
economic reform, which requires transformation not simply of economic and
institutional infrastructures but people's understanding of and ability to
operate in a market economy.
Western assistance has been inadequate, badly co-ordinated and poorly
targeted, the report says. Too little attention has been paid to
constructing coherent long-term transition plans and building a public
consensus behind them, including provision of an effective welfare safety
net.
Bilateral and multilateral financing for eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union may have amounted to about Dollars 40bn last year, the ECE
estimates. But only a small proportion of this money was grant aid or
concessionary finance and little was directly focused on reform activities.
About half was accounted for by debt rescheduling and other forms of
'special financing'.
The total sum compares with net German government transfers of Dollars 96bn
to its new eastern states in 1992, the report notes.
Foreign direct investment too has proved disappointing. Net inflows rose
from about Dollars 600m in 1990 to just under Dollars 3bn last year, but
this compares with the Dollars 28bn or so flowing to developing countries
and worldwide flows of some Dollars 200bn. In addition, 90 per cent is
concentrated in Hungary and the Czech Republic.
'When debt servicing and other income payments are set in the balance
against capital inflows, there was a net outflow of resources from most of
the east European countries in 1992,' the report says.
It also warns that protectionist pressures in Europe, such as recent EC
restrictions on steel imports, threaten to snuff out glimmerings of economic
recovery in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have been largely
based on growth of exports to the west.
Reviewing economic developments last year in eastern Europe (excluding the
former Soviet Union), the ECE says output fell for the fourth year in
succession, by 10 per cent, bringing the cumulative drop in GDP to more than
30 per cent. However, there were signs that the downturn was beginning to
bottom out and in a few countries there were signs of recovery.
In Poland, GDP rose slightly last year, and a further increase is expected
in 1993. Hungary, too, may see some rise in output this year. But the ECE
fears the rupture in trade relations between the new Czech and Slovak
republics could stifle Czech growth prospects in 1993 and worsen the
predicted drop in Slovak output. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, output is
predicted to go on falling this year but by less than in 1992.
In Russia, the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics 'the slump in
output deepened through 1992'. The ECE is making no prognosis for 1993.
Russian net material product (which excludes services) fell by 19 per cent
last year. In the Baltic states, output fell by 28 to 44 per cent.
Meanwhile, recorded unemployment in the transition economies rose rapidly in
1992, the Czech Republic being a notable exception, and the ECE expects
another sharp increase this year as privatisation and bankruptcy laws bring
redundancies in their wake.
The report notes that private sector activity is growing strongly in eastern
Europe, especially in agriculture, construction, trade and other services,
but not by enough to cushion job losses in largely state-run industry.
Inflation fell last year in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and
the Baltic states but accelerated elsewhere. In Russia, the proportion of
people officially classified as living below minimum subsistence levels more
than doubled to 29 per cent over the year, as real incomes slumped.

BULGARIA has banned imports of livestock and dairy products from the
European Community, effective from yesterday, agriculture ministry officials
said, Reuter reports from Sofia.
The ban was imposed because of cases of foot-and-mouth disease in some EC
countries, according to a ministry spokesman
Bulgaria, which is free of the disease, also banned the transit of live
animals from the EC through the country.
The move followed an EC decision last week to ban imports of live animals,
meat, milk and dairy products from eastern Europe until May 10 to prevent
the spread of the disease.

FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Russian space plans struggle to take off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN space industry has hit difficulties in its western sales drive
less than two weeks ahead of the official signing of its first commercial
contract, worth Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.8m).
Three obstacles to further contracts emerged yesterday.
Inmarsat, the London-based telecommunications satellite operator which is
the Russians' first western customer, said the export licence for the
US-built satellite scheduled to be launched on board a Proton rocket from
Kazakhstan in 1995 could be a one-off.
The new administration in Washington appears keen to protect the struggling
US space launch business against cut-price competition. At last week's
Clinton-Yeltsin summit in Canada, the talk was of co-operation at a
scientific, rather than commercial, level.
At the same time Russia has not yet established whether it will be able to
make commercial use of the former Soviet launch base at Baikonur in
Kazakhstan.
Mr Dmitri Poluhin, director general of DB Salyut, which designs the Proton,
the commercial launch vehicle, said yesterday that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin would hold talks next month with Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president
of Kazakhstan, over the base.
Finally there have been differences between DB Salyut and Khrunichev, which
builds the Proton, over their dealings with the west.
Mr Poluhin said DB Salyut was the senior partner and would be signing the
contract with Inmarsat. But he conceded that Khrunichev had bypassed DB
Salyut and dealt directly with Motorola of the US over three Proton launches
for a planned global mobile telecommunications network.
Mr Poluhin said he expected Motorola to deal with DB Salyut but had no sign
yet of an approach.
The confusion was underlined by Mr Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director
general. He said the precise costs of the Russian launch had not yet been
established, and would probably be only slightly cheaper that the Dollars
62m charged by the market leader, Arianespace.
The Russian space industry dwarfs that of the west. Its potential to charge
low prices for reliable launches has raised hopes that it could be a
significant hard currency earner. But this has alarmed western rivals,
especially in the US where recent launch failures have triggered a rise in
space insurance premiums. Insurance already costs satellite owners more than
Pounds 300m a year.

FT  14 APR 93 / Canada's provinces get the borrowing habit: Capital markets
are concerned at ever-rising deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOD GUNDY, the Canadian securities firm, arranges regular conference calls
to bring clients up to date on economic trends. The speakers at two
briefings earlier this month, however, were not Wood Gundy's own economists
but the finance ministers of the provinces of Newfoundland and New
Brunswick.
Their presence is evidence that the 10 provinces' priority these days is to
impress international capital markets, rather than woo voters with lower
taxes or expanded public services.
The reason is summed up by Mr Bill Jones, director of capital markets in
Saskatchewan: 'More and more investors have some concerns about what is
happening to the provincial credit situation.' The capital markets'
influence has been evident since the start of the annual provincial budget
season in mid-March.
Of the five provinces which have tabled budgets so far, four (Saskatchewan,
Newfoundland, Manitoba and New Brunswick) have included spending cuts.
Although Newfoundland's Liberal government faces an election next month, the
budget included cuts in civil service pay, a commitment not to build any new
schools and delays in construction of medical clinics.
'Once upon a time it was possible to do a budget with election goodies. We
didn't have that luxury,' the finance minister, Mr Winston Baker, said.
In Saskatchewan, the provincial sales tax was raised from 8 to 9 per cent.
Spending on education will be trimmed by 4 per cent, and the days of free
dental care for schoolchildren are over. The government promised to
eliminate the provincial deficit, totalling almost CDollars 600m (Pounds
314m) in the year to March 31 1993, within the next four years.
Similar measures are expected when the other provinces table their 1993/94
budgets over the next two months. Quebec has already asked its civil
servants to accept a two-year pay freeze.
Ontario's Social-Democrat government, faced with a jump in its deficit from
CDollars 10bn to as much as CDollars 17bn, is trying to persuade trade
unions to accept pay cuts or face lay-offs.
Canada's ratio of federal and provincial debt to GDP has soared from 54 per
cent in 1981 to 92 per cent last year. While the provinces accounted for
less than 10 per cent of the total in the early 1980s, they now make up
about 41 per cent. Their combined borrowing requirements exceeded that of
the federal government for the first time in the 1991/92 fiscal year.
The recession is only partly to blame for the deterioration. Growth in
corporate and personal tax revenues has slowed in line with the overall
economy. On the other side of the equation, demands have grown for higher
spending, especially on welfare.
But Mr Stephen Dafoe, associate director at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York
rating agency, warns that 'there is a substantial component of these
deficits which will not go away once economic growth resumes'.
The drop in Canada's annual inflation rate to about 2 per cent means that
governments cannot rely on higher prices to produce growth in sales taxes,
or rising wages to push individual taxpayers into higher tax brackets.
Furthermore, companies' efforts to contain the size of their workforces
could hold down revenues from the payroll taxes which fund some provinces'
healthcare budgets.
The new-found enthusiasm for fiscal austerity reflects a growing public
awareness of the implications of a rising debt burden.
Mr John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, last month identified
public-sector debt as a drag on economic recovery. He said that a
disciplined approach to public finances 'needs to continue if Canada is to
generate the increased savings to finance adequately its investment needs'.
Furthermore, investors in Canadian provincial bonds are demanding higher
interest rates relative to other borrowers. Ontario, whose credit rating has
been cut twice in the past two years, was able to sell its long-term bonds
in the mid-1980s at yields of 40 basis points, or 40/100ths of a percentage
point, above comparable Canadian government issues. Those bonds now trade at
a 'spread' of 92-93 basis points.
S&amp;P has four provinces - Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec - on
'negative outlook', which implies another possible downgrade within the next
year or so.
While the most visible belt-tightening in the budgets consists of cuts to
specific programmes and higher taxes, each level of government is trying to
force the toughest decisions on to the next level down.
Provincial treasurers complain loudly about cuts in transfer payments from
the federal government in Ottawa.
The provinces, in turn, are putting the squeeze on local authorities.
Ontario, for instance, plans to raise its transfers to municipalities,
hospitals and schools by 2 per cent in the year to March 31 1994, but to
take back the entire increase the following year.
Mr Ted Carmichael, senior economist at Burns Fry in Toronto, says that
Canada's tax competitiveness for foreign investors could be eroded as
municipalities are forced to push up property taxes, which are not sensitive
to corporate profitability or personal income.
How long the ardour for austerity will last is open to question. Last year's
combined provincial deficit of CDollars 25bn was a quarter higher than
original projections.
The federal government has consistently failed to meet its deficit-reduction
targets over the past eight years. This year's deficit, estimated at
CDollars 34-CDollars 35bn, will be almost the same as it was in the year
after the Conservative government came to office in 1985.
Economists believe that the only way to make a meaningful dent in budget
deficits is to overhaul some of the cornerstones of Canada's social security
net, such as generous welfare payments and the government-funded healthcare
system. Healthcare makes up about a third of provincial spending.
Some provinces are inching towards fundamental reforms, such as introducing
user fees for medical services and linking welfare payments to job training.
The federal government last year eliminated cash 'family allowances' paid to
upper-income taxpayers. Ottawa is also eager to gain tighter control over
the provinces' budget-making process.
But even in the present climate of restraint, any tampering with health and
social security benefits or provincial powers carries enormous political
risks. Mr Dafoe says that 'one may wish to be optimistic, but political
realities sometimes do not allow measures to be taken which achieve
substantial results.'

Vietnam yesterday flatly rejected a report suggesting that it lied over the
number of American prisoners it was holding shortly before the US withdrawal
from Indochina in 1973, Reuter reports from Hanoi. It also denied it was
still holding any prisoners.
The issue, which flared up with disclosure of a document found in Moscow
archives and said to be from the North Vietnamese army, looked likely to
delay efforts to reconcile Hanoi and Washington 18 years after the Vietnam
war ended. Vietnamese officials said every time a breakthrough appeared
imminent in relations with the US, forces in Washington opposed to
reconciliation threw a spanner in the works.

India's exports, which fell in December and January due to the disruption

regain lost ground, according to figures announced yesterday, Stefan Wagstyl
reports from New Delhi.
However, the recovery was only moderate in scale, indicating that much of
the export revenue lost in the previous two months has been lost for good,
as foreign buyers found alternative sources of supply. Exports in February
rose 8.1 per cent to Dollars 1.78bn (Pounds 1.2bn) compared with the same
month last year. Imports fell slightly to Dollars 1.69bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA was braced for potential violence during today's planned mass
strike called by the African National Congress to mourn the weekend
assassination of guerrilla leader Mr Chris Hani.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, warned last night on national television
that South Africa was 'on the brink of disaster'. In an emotional address,
he appealed for calm and urged respect for whites. 'We must not let the men
who worship war and who lust after blood precipitate actions that will
plunge our country into another Angola,' he said.
Mr Mandela issued a special appeal to South Arica's ultra-radical youth:
'You have lost a great hero. You have repeatedly shown that your love of
freedom is greater than. . . life itself. But you are the leaders of
tomorrow. Your country, your people, your organisation need you to act with
wisdom.'
He said Mr Hani would be buried on Monday, in one of the most important
political events in South African history. Constitutional talks would be
delayed by one week of mourning. Worried by the risk of violence, the South
African Chamber of Business (Sacob), the largest employer organisation,
issued an unusally conciliatory statement urging employers to handle the
tense situation with sensitivity. A Sacob official urged no disciplinary
action be taken against employees failing to attend work.
the organisation said, pointing out that the stayaway could mean employees
would be unable to attend work for lack of transport.
Yesterday, the first day of the ANC's planned campaign of 'rolling mass
action' passed off with some incidents of violence, especially in the
eastern Cape province where three youths were killed after they stoned a
police vehicle. Many parts of the province were declared 'unrest areas,'
with curfews and a ban on weapons.
A small demonstration was held outside the Boksburg magistrate's court where
the alleged assassin, Mr Janusz Walus, appeared. He was remanded in custody
until May 12. In another South African court, charges were withdrawn against
27 of 74 men accused of involvement in last year's Boipatong massacre, which
led to a nine-month suspension of constitutional talks.

FT  14 APR 93 / Hong Kong travels down a familiar path: The sense of deja vu
over Patten's plans for electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS possible, just possible, to interpret yesterday's announcement of
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future as a victory for Mr Chris
Patten, the colony's governor.
China backed down on its pre-condition that his package of proposals for the
colony's 1994-95 elections be dropped before talks could begin. It also
appears to have backed down on its objection to Hong Kong government
officials being members of the British team.
By standing firm on these 'principles', Mr Patten may have won concessions
from a government which does not concede ground lightly. But then again, he
may not.
The prospect of talks is not one which fills many in the Hong Kong
government with confidence. Hong Kong has been down this road before and, if
the past is a guide, the future could be bleak.
'To quote Samuel Goldwyn, 'it feels like deja vu all over again',' one
official noted yesterday. Another spoke of the 'crimp and mire' of talks.
The Chinese government wants these talks, much more than Mr Patten does, for
a number of reasons. The most important is that talks re-establish the
precedent of China and Britain deciding Hong Kong's fate.
The thought of Mr Patten's plans for a more democratic method of electing
members to the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law making body,
being decided by LegCo alone filled Beijing with dread. It would have
established a precedent, just four years from the transfer of sovereignty,
of Hong Kong deciding something without the blessing of its future
sovereign.
This fear, on China's part, is perhaps Mr Patten's strongest card in his
otherwise rather weak hand. He can, if the negotiation appears fruitless,
take his leave and present his package to LegCo. The Chinese, once bitten by
Mr Patten's 'surprise' decision to gazette his legislation on March 12, are,
however, likely to be twice shy. They will not easily provide him with
reason to withdraw.
The talks also put the issue into a forum in which China has displayed
mastery in the past. One only has to look at the Hong Kong's long drawn-out
attempt to build a new airport to see that China is the master of fudge and
delay if it does not get what it wants.
A memorandum of understanding, signed by the UK and Chinese prime ministers
in September 1991, has been shown to be worthless in the face of a greater
Chinese interest, namely, demonstrating its control over Hong Kong. The
prize China can dangle in Britain's and Hong Kong's face is its final
approval for the airport if London and Beijing can reach a binding
agreement.
China also knows that it is in the nature of a negotiation that the position
stated at the beginning is rarely the one prevailing at the end. The British
position is well known.
The two central elements of Mr Patten's package are: an electoral college,
which will return 10 members of LegCo in 1995, which consists of
democratically elected local officials; and nine 'functional' constituencies
which would be elected by Hong Kong's working population of 2.7m.
What is much less well known is China's position. Aside from heaping
derision on Mr Patten for his 'three violations' - China claims Mr Patten's
blueprint runs counter to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 1991
Basic Law, and a series of exchanges between foreign ministers in early 1990
 -Beijing has yet to deliver itself of its proposals for the 1995 polls.
The talks will hinge, therefore, on two factors: what proposals for the 1995
elections Beijing brings to the table, and whether it is able to accept the
deadline for enactment of enabling legislation by the summer, or autumn at
the latest.
Mr Patten's public remarks suggest that he believes China wants to rig the
election. He has trumpeted in Brussels and London over the past week his
determination to see elections that are 'clean' - a condition he has made
synonymous with Britain's national honour.
China has never much been concerned with British honour. But what Mr Patten
has to hope is that Beijing has an interest in settling the issue on
reasonable terms, and on that he would not be wanting to bet very much
money.

FT  14 APR 93 / Nigeria acts to avoid poll unrest

NIGERIA'S ruling military council has postponed removal of the fuel price
subsidy, due on June 1, to avoid unrest in the run-up to presidential
elections on June 12.
A cut in the subsidy is seen as vital for an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, which began its mission to Nigeria yesterday.
The postponement is a setback for the civilian transitional council, which
has pledged to cut the budget deficit to help get an early IMF agreement, a
pre-condition for rescheduling the country's external debt.
The move follows persistent threats of strikes and riots. An official
statement after a weekend meeting at the federal capital of Abuja said there
would be 'no new pricing of petroleum products' on June 1. 'The government
remains committed to ensuring that nothing is done to impede the progress of
the transition' to elected civilian rule, it added.
The meeting was chaired by President Ibrahim Babangida and included his
vice-president, Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, as well as General Sani Abacha,
defence minister, Mr Ernest Shonekan, leader of the transitional council,
and Mr Philip Asiodu, oil secretary.
Mr Shonekan, one of Nigeria's leading businessmen, has been frustrated in
his attempts to instil fiscal discipline, achieve a market rate for foreign
exchange and stimulate private sector investment.
Hopes raised by the 1993 budget and other policy statements have turned to
disillusionment, as Mr Shonekan appears powerless to resist military
intervention in his reforms.
The proposed rise in fuel prices by more than 500 per cent to import parity
was also designed to halt smuggling and provide money for maintenance of
refineries and distribution systems.
Fuel shortages, which have afflicted the north for weeks, spread to the
commercial capital, Lagos, over the weekend when a fire closed a depot.
Petrol riots are not the only potential threat to peaceful civilian
handover. Allegations of misconduct at last month's election of presidential
candidates have rekindled demands that the handover be delayed for the
fourth time in three years and the National Electoral Commission has made
the elections conditional on its screening of presidential running mates,
yet to be chosen by the two Moslem candidates.

FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Japan package well wrapped, but
is it the goods? - Large and impeccable in its timing, the quality is
nonetheless open to debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Japanese government unveiled its economic package yesterday to a
fanfare of surging stock prices, there were broad smiles of
self-satisfaction among political leaders and bureaucrats.
They had fashioned a package larger than promised, and delivered it just as
two senior US officials landed in Tokyo for a meeting of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries.
Japan is often criticised for getting the timing of its big announcements
wrong, as a sluggish bureaucracy works in its own, isolated time zone. But
the timing of yesterday's announcement, politically and economically, could
not be faulted, prompting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to declare
that the period of economic decline was over.
However, the quality of the package's content is open to debate, and the
finance ministry's forecast that the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) in spending and
tax concessions will produce an extra 2.6 per cent of nominal gross national
product growth is certainly questionable.
The Sakura Research Institute estimates that it will add 1.2 per cent,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 1.3 per cent and Baring Securities 0.8 per cent - and
'that's generous'.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, has repeatedly suggested that the
economy is weighed down by sluggish consumer demand and corporate capital
investment. And the finance ministry, which agreed on the final total after
a hard night's negotiation with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, admits
there is little direct stimulation in those areas.
There is Y520bn in extra funds to government-affiliated institutions for the
promotion of private equipment investment, and a tax concession for home
buyers, who will have the maximum amount of deductible loan repayments
lifted by 20 per cent. But a cut in income taxes was not included, and a
finance ministry official said there is no prospect of a tax cut this year.
Most Japanese manufacturers are in the midst of restructuring, in
particular, cuts in capacity and a trimming of bloated workforces. They have
limited room for an increase in capital spending, which was highlighted by a
15.9 per cent year-on-year fall in private machinery orders in February.
Nevertheless consumers appear to have the means but not the confidence to
increase spending, as was shown by a 6.1 per cent fall in department store
sales during February.
On hearing of the package's contents, the Japan Department Stores'
Association said the absence of a tax cut was 'very disappointing', and
final demand was likely to remain weak for the indefinite future.
Other business groups were more enthusiastic. The Association of Corporate
Executives said the 'economy has already shown signs of recovery and the
package will ensure that recovery'.
The Federation of Employers' Associations said the timing, coming
immediately after the passing of the 1993 budget, was ideal, and would
stimulate demand.
The euphoria surrounding the announcement yesterday, combined with the stock
market's recovery, have also given LDP officials the impression that the
immediate economic future is bright. But a separate set of Bank of Japan
loan figures for March released yesterday suggest that, instead of providing
a quick fix, the package will be part of a long-haul recovery.
Outstanding commercial bank loans expanded by only 1.3 per cent in March,
the slowest growth on record, and a sign that banks are either wary of fresh
lending or that corporate demand for funds is still in decline. The most
likely explanation is a mix of both causes. Private economists expect money
supply, which expanded by 0.2 per cent in February, to shrink again in
March.
'The economy is bumping along the bottom,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker,
economist at Baring Securities. 'The package will help, but you are not
going to see all the growth this year, and a lot of the money is recycled
rather than new. But the increase in funds for the Housing Loan Corporation
will make a difference.'
The Housing Loan Corporation provides a third of all mortgages in Japan, and
the package increased the funds available this year from Y7,283bn to
Y9,253bn, and provides for a reduction in interest rates from 4.3 per cent
to 4.1 per cent. At the same time, Y1.6bn in land for public projects will
be purchased ahead of schedule.
It is expected that the lending measures will increase demand for new homes,
but the package will provide little assistance to banks, burdened with about
Y30,000bn in bad property loans - most of which are linked to speculative
developments outside the range of the Housing Loan Corporation.
In presenting the package, the finance ministry suggested that almost all
the funds were 'fresh water', but the reliance on the Fiscal Investment and
Loan Programme (FILP), funded by postal savings, for about Y4,900bn of the
total means that much of the money is being recycled more quickly rather
than genuinely fresh.
The combination of FILP funds, which would otherwise be used for government
bond purchases or for loans to government financial institutions, and funds
to be provided by local governments totals Y6,900bn, leaving the central
government to muster the remaining money. Finance ministry officials said
construction bonds were likely to be used to fill the gap.
But the use of construction bonds, which are supposed to be used only for
infrastructure spending, raises awkward questions about spending for 'social
infrastructure', listed at Y1,150bn.
US officials will be told that US companies could provide this
infrastructure, which apparently includes supercomputers and other
sophisticated electronics, though construction bonds are not supposed to be
used for such equipment.

FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Officials keep a waryeye on the
bubble

IN OTEMACHI, Tokyo's business centre, office workers crowded around a stock
price board in a Yamaichi Securities branch yesterday as the Nikkei average
closed above the psychologically important 20,000 mark for the first time in
over a year.
The renewed enthusiasm for stocks coincided with the release of the
government's emergency package yesterday, and the talk now is not how far
the Nikkei average will fall but how much it will surge in coming days.
However, the sudden change in sentiment has a dark side.
Apart from sending most issues flickering higher on the electronic boards in
brokerages around the country yesterday, the package has also intensified
concern over the possibilty of a resurgence of an asset 'bubble' last seen
in the late 1980s.
Government officials claim that they are keeping close watch over any signs
of an asset bubble.
'We've formulated the package after closely reviewing what happened in
1986,' said Mr Yoseki Nagase, director general at the Economic Planning
Agency.
The comparisons, however, are compelling.
Interest rates then were cut to historical lows, and a Y6,000bn (Pounds
35bn) emergency economic package was introduced in 1986 to help companies
recover from a strengthening yen.
But Mr Nagase argues that the current economic background is very different
from the mid-1980s, when money supply was posting double digit gains and
stock and property prices were also surging. 'Capital investment and
consumer demand will not be able to recover without assistance,' he added.
However, the latest stimulatory package comes at a time when some analysts
believe that some statistics have indicated a bottoming out of the economy.
A 23 per cent rise in the stock market over the past two months has restored
confidence in the country's brokers, who are now urging investors to return
to the market or risk missing out on a the chance of making a quick profit.
The recovery in share prices will aid Japanese companies, which have been
forced to write off losses on their stock portfolios.
According to stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo, a 15 per cent rise in
the stock market theoretically creates about Y45,000bn of financial wealth.
With the stock market higher, the package may help inflate property prices,
another 'bubble' characteristic.
The package includes a total of Y1,600bn to be pumped into the property
market through advance land purchases for publics works.
Limits on housing loans provided by quasi-governmental housing loan
organisations will now be raised, while lending rates on the loans will be
lowered.
There are also fears of overheating due to a bunching of the government's
infrastructure projects.
The full effects of the public works projects from last August's Y10,700bn
emergency package have yet to be felt fully, as the govern-ment expects the
bulk of the projects to be started in this financial year.
Additionally, the government intends to front-load 75 per cent, or Y12,208bn
worth, of public works contracts for the current year's usual budget into
the April-June quarter.
While government officials flatly reject suggestions of another asset bubble
emerging, they admit that they are also aware of the implications of low
interest rates and large fiscal stimulus.
'But we are able to learn from experience,' said Mr Nagase.
'In the 1970s we managed to handle the second oil shock from our experience
of the first one.'

FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Tokyo polishes trade defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS senior US officials arrived in Tokyo yesterday, the Japanese government
was preparing its defence on trade and proudly displayed yesterday's fiscal
stimulus package.
The massive US trade deficit with Japan has kept American politicians,
industrialists and academics busy debating a variety of measures to deal
with the problem. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday
said Japan needed to commit itself to solving individual trade issues.
His comment reflects the favoured approach in Washington lately, which has
been for the US and Japan to set quantifiable import targets for specific
market sectors. However, Japan has been arguing for a macro-economic
approach to reducing its trade surplus.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, in Tokyo for the G7 meeting,
acknowledged Japan's efforts to stimulate domestic demand for foreign
products, but added that the country was in a good position to be able to do
a great deal in spurring economic growth because of its sound fiscal
position and huge external surplus.
In reply, Japan's trade ministry claimed that the package would boost
faltering domestic demand and reduce the trade surplus. Mr Noboru
Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti) said: 'If the US is concerned about
the trade imbalance, I think the economic package of this size will be
enough.'
Aside from trying to support demand through public investment projects, the
package includes measures to promote imports by cutting interest rates on
loans by public financial institutions for sales of imported goods. Limits
on loans to foreign companies by the Export Import Bank of Japan are to be
raised and the government also pledged procurement of foreign products for
facility investments.
The government said the measures could boost the country's imports by more
than Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.9bn). It has also tried to assure the US that
foreign manufacturers would get a fair share of the new public procurement.
However, Japan has been careful not to set a fixed goal for public purchases
of foreign goods, and Mr Hatakeyama said the government's purchases would be
determined by open bidding. 'Although many import-friendly items are
included in the government procurement plan, there is absolutely no room for
us to agree to the 'goal' approach because it leads to misunderstanding and
managed trade,' he said.
Japan's frictions over the semiconductor arrangement with the US prompted
its cautious stance towards quantifiable targets. In the semiconductor
arrangement the two countries agreed that the US expected to see the foreign
share of the Japanese semiconductor market rise to 20 per cent by the end of
1992. While Japan insisted that the market share figure was no more than an
expectation, the US side interpreted it as a commitment by Japan.
Meanwhile, the Japanese government claimed that a factor which would offset
its efforts to boost the economy was the further strengthening of the yen.
The US is seen to favour a higher yen to reduce Japan's exports, but Mr
Hatakeyama warned that an excessively rapid rise would reduce the impact of
the economic measures. Although Japan was in a position to accept the
long-term appreciation of the yen, 'too drastic an appreciation of the yen
is not good for our economy,' he said.

FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Japanese trade surplus for 1992
rises to Dollars 111bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus for fiscal 1992, which ended last month, rose 26.2 per
cent to Dollars 111.34bn (Pounds 73bn) as the slowing of the economy led to
weaker demand for imports and a widening of the country's bilateral
surpluses with the European Community and the US.
The Japanese government is hoping that yesterday's announcement of a new
stimulatory package will defuse criticism of the surplus. However, finance
ministry officials admitted that import demand is unlikely to recover
quickly in the coming months.
Japan's customs-cleared imports from the US fell 2.4 per cent to Dollars
52.3bn, while exports to the US were 7 per cent higher at Dollars 98.4bn.
Exports to the EC rose 2.9 per cent to Dollars 61.5bn and imports from the
EC were down 2.6 per cent at Dollars 30.5bn, while total exports were 7.4
per cent higher and imports grew 0.3 per cent.
The surplus had peaked in 1986 at Dollars 89.7bn, falling to Dollars 54.3bn
in 1990, but it has expanded rapidly over the past two years as the domestic
economy stalled, creating international pressure on the government to
rekindle growth.
But the expansion is not over yet. For the month of March, the surplus
increased 26 per cent to Dollars 13.78bn, after a 15.4 per cent rise in
exports and a 9.4 per cent lift in imports.
Seasonally adjusted, the surplus was Dollars 9.98bn, down from Dollars
10.19bn in February.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said that the yen's
appreciation was responsible for much of the increase, as the average
yen-dollar rate last month was Y117.84 compared with Y130.78 last year.
Yen-based exports were only 4 per cent higher during the month, and imports
were 1.1 per cent lower than a year earlier.
Japanese officials are concerned that the recent rapid appreciation of the
yen will push the surplus higher over the next couple of months, before
yesterday's package has time to take effect. They are also conscious that
the new US administration may see a continuing rise in the surplus as a sign
that Japan must be pressed for further market-opening concessions.
The figures reflect the changing patterns of Japanese trade.
Exports to China during the year were 36.4 per cent higher and imports from
that country expanded by 20.1 per cent, while exports to Russia fell 35.8
per cent and imports were down 21.5 per cent.
The China boom continued during the month of March, when exports from Japan
rose 57.1 per cent on the same month last year, and imports were 32.3 per
cent higher, lifting that country above Taiwan and South Korea among Japan's
trading partners, and putting it second only to the US.
During March, exports of transport machinery, mostly cars, rose 23.5 per
cent and those of general machinery were 15.4 per cent higher. The strongest
import growth was in mineral fuels, up 15.8 per cent, and machinery, up 10.4
per cent.

FT  14 APR 93 / Little comfort for Moscow in Cossack land: Chrystia Freeland
finds dismay and yearnings for autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MOSCOW, the on-going struggle between Russian president Boris Yeltsin and
the Congress of People's Deputies is often painted as a showdown between the
forces of good - Mr Yeltsin and his reform team - and the forces of evil -
the ex-communist legislature.
But along the fertile banks of the Don river, once home to the free-booting
Cossacks who defended Imperial Russia's periphery, the contest, and the
referendum on April 25, which is meant to decide its outcome, are cast in a
different light.
'All that the referendum represents is a choice between Bolsheviks and
Communists,' says Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 'They are all from the old system
and are merely fighting among themselves for power.'
A 32-year-old private businessman dressed in the leather jacket, blue jeans
and Reeboks of Russia's nouveaux riches, Mr Dzhanibekov represents what
should be Mr Yeltsin's key constituency - the nascent bourgeoisie.
But, like many of the citizens of Rostov-on-Don walking past the city's
Lenin statue on their way home from work, Mr Dzhanibekov is so disgusted by
his country's politics that he does not intend to vote.
The same disenchantment prevails amid the emerald green fields of winter
wheat in the Rostov region countryside.
'I will vote for anyone but Yeltsin,' says Mr Alexander Martynenko, the
52-year-old head of one of the work teams at the 'Illych's (as in Vladimir
Illych Lenin) Testament' farm 50 miles south of Rostov-on-Don. 'All that
presidential rule has given us is a new layer of bureaucrats who are like
blood-suckers on the people.'
Even Yeltsin supporters no longer display the enthusiasm which inspired 70
per cent of Rostov-on-Don's eligible voters to back Mr Yeltsin in the
presidential elections 18 months ago.
Irina, a smartly dressed 21-year-old accountant in the municipal government,
says: 'I will probably vote for Yeltsin. He is the best of two evils.'
This pervasive disillusionment is bad news for Mr Yeltsin. Earlier this
month Mr Yeltsin dropped plans to hold his own plebiscite and agreed to face
a much tougher referendum set by the congress. The congress's poll includes
one potentially crippling condition: to win, Mr Yeltsin needs the support of
50 per cent of registered voters, not just a simple majority.
The mood in Rostov-on-Don, which ranges from outright hostility toward Mr
Yeltsin to lukewarm support, suggests the Russian president may be unable to
clear the congress's hurdle.
This is a possibility which Mr Mikhail Gaychuk, deputy head of the regional
legislature, forecasts with evident glee.
'I think that there will not be a high enough voter turn-out to give the
referendum legal validity,' Mr Gaychuk said, sitting beneath a
black-and-white portrait of Lenin. 'And if the referendum is not valid, the
congress will be proven right and Mr Yeltsin will have thrown money to the
winds.'
One flight of stairs away, in the massive white building which houses the
various layers of government in Rostov oblast (province), Mr Vladimir Chub,
head of the regional executive and thus a Yeltsin appointee, is rooting for
the president.
Mr Chub thinks that Mr Yeltsin can win the required support of 50 per cent
of eligible voters - but only if a massive election campaign is launched
immediately.
Yet even Mr Yeltsin's man on the Don poses a potential threat to Moscow. A
proud descendant of the Cossacks, who ran the region through their own
social and political structures before 1917 in exchange for fighting for the
Tsar, Mr Chub sympathises with the demands of modern Cossack organisations
for greater local autonomy.
Mr Chub thinks that Rostov oblast should be granted the same rights accorded
to the autonomous republics which make up the Russian federation.
This bid for regional devolution of power could, in the long run, be even
more dangerous for Mr Yeltsin than a defeat in the referendum.
Local leaders are aware that they possess a powerful bargaining chip. Rostov
oblast, which produces between 7m and 8m tonnes of grain annually, is
Russia's leading supplier of grain. Since the collapse of the former Soviet
Union, which deprived Russia of control over Ukraine and Kazakhstan, its
traditional granaries, Rostov's fertile steppes have become more critical
than ever.
If grain is Rostov's trump card, the Cossacks are the regional wild card.
According to Cossack activists, nearly 2m young men in southern Russia have
registered as Cossacks. In the spirit of their warrior ancestors, these
modern Cossacks have rushed to the armed defence of Russians against
non-Slavs in hot-spots such as the Trans-Dnestr region of Moldova.
At home in Rostov-on-Don, they strut through the streets sporting the wild
moustaches favoured by Cossacks of old and tsarist uniforms. Public
sentiment in the riverside town is decidedly hostile toward these
gun-toting, vodka-swilling defenders of the Orthodox faith.
But they appear to have struck a chord with Mr Yeltsin, who last month
issued a presidential decree recognising Cossack organisations. The decree
was promptly struck down by the congress.
As a result, the Cossacks say they will back the president in the
referendum. But it is another reason some citizens of Rostov-on-Don cite
when explaining why they plan to vote against Mr Yeltsin.

THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday failed to secure the
propaganda victory he sought in his first provincial visit ahead of the
April 25 national referendum.
With his campaign appearing lacklustre and his reception in the Siberian
mining town of Novokuznetsk distinctly lukewarm, the trip did little to
convince onlookers that he had the enthusiasm for the political fight ahead.
Barely a few thousand people turned out to line the streets of the town,
part of the Kuzbass region which encompasses 100 mines.
Mr Yeltsin no doubt still has the support of the region, which has long a
been a bastion of support for him, but the president was yesterday greeted
with a barrage of strident demands both from miners and regional leaders.
Regional leaders, concerned about the future of the region's coal industry,
are demanding both fresh subsidies and greater economic autonomy from
Moscow. Local miners are furious that their salaries, once among the highest
in the region, have been eroded by inflation.
In a stuffy hall, packed with 400 miners, Mr Yeltsin announced that one of
the largest mines in the area would embark on an experimental programme of
partial privatisation, with 38 per cent of the mine's ownership to be passed
from the state to the mine next month. Until now, the privatisation
programme has barely touched the mining industry.
However, Mr Yeltsin insisted that he could not free the price of coal, which
is currently partly controlled by the government.
'If we did that, it would lead to a social explosion,' Mr Yeltsin said. The
miners responded politely but without real conviction.
Mr Vladimir Lavrik, director of the Abashaskaya mine, said that without
further economic reform, the mining industry faced catastrophe. Mr Vachoslav
Sharipov, leader of the mining unions, warned that unless further aid was
forthcoming, the president could not rely on the support of miners.
'Presidents and governments come and go, but the union will remain here,' he
said.
He admitted afterwards that he was 'disappointed' by Mr Yeltsin's speech,
although he believed that most miners would still support the president in
the referendum.

FOREIGN and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised
nations gathered in Tokyo last night for a two-day meeting which will
attempt to secure the leadership of Russian President Boris Yeltsin by
providing his country with another substantial aid package.
The pressure on Japan, as host, to give generously was reflected in a
government decision to increase its planned bilateral assistance from
Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) which includes trade
insurance, humanitarian aid, and technological assistance to the Russian
nuclear industry.
Japan's assistance is expected to be announced today in an address by Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who has made clear to other
participants that Tokyo will not formally raise the contentious issue of the
Kurile Islands.
The islands, which were occupied by Soviet troops in 1945, are claimed by
Japan.
Apart from Russia, foreign ministers are expected to discuss the United
Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, threatened by increasing
violence, and the continuing conflict in Bosnia. They are also expected to
discuss North Korea's announced pull-out from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
Finance ministers will hold their first session this afternoon, and discuss
the state of the international economy. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japan's finance
minister, intends to explain the stimulatory package announced yesterday and
hopes to prompt discussion on the rapid appreciation of the yen.
But Japanese officials expect that the US and other G7 members will have
little sympathy for Tokyo's concerns that the yen's movement could put extra
pressure on the country's export industries. Instead of focusing just on the
yen's rise, Japanese officials plan to argue in favour of 'currency
stability'.
Bilateral meetings with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
will be held by individual countries today, but the group discussion of
assistance to Moscow is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning.
It is expected that a final package will total around Dollars 36bn, but that
figure includes already negotiated debt relief and credit extensions from
the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister, said yesterday that the quality of
aid was important. He intends to emphasise the need for increased assistance
for the restructuring of Russian companies and will reflect Tokyo's concerns
about pouring large, poorly targeted amounts of money into a 'black hole'.
Meanwhile, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the
ministers had come to Tokyo on a 'noble mission': 'That is, to determine how
the world's industrialised democracies can best unite together to support
the historic struggle of the Russian people to build a free society and a
vibrant economy.'

THE Start-2 disarmament treaty became the latest political football in
Russia's pre-referendum electioneering, when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
parliamentary speaker, yesterday said deputies would not ratify it until the
foreign minister was sacked.
'First of all this treaty should be submitted by a minister of foreign
affairs who enjoys the respect and trust of society. As long as there is no
such minister, I think it is absurd to even talk about Start-2,' he said.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, one of the architects of the treaty
slashing US and Russian nuclear arsenals, is hated by conservatives for his
pro-western policies.
The Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, and Ukrainian President Leonid
Kravchuk yesterday signed a friendship and mutual assistance treaty in Kiev
with the clear intention of forming a political front against Russia, writes
Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
Mr Shevardnadze said Ukraine had agreed to act as a peacekeeper in the
Georgian region of Abkhazia, where government forces are fighting
separatists. He added that Ukraine and Georgia might co-operate in producing
armaments and training soldiers.

FT  14 APR 93 / IG Metall may shift stance on E German pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS have emerged that IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, may
be about to abandon its opposition to separate wage deals between individual
east German companies and their employees. Any such move away from
centralised wage bargaining would have important implications for industrial
relations throughout Germany, according to economists.
'Essentially, this dispute (between union and employers in eastern Germany)
is about deciding where power lies,' one economist said. 'Will wage
negotiations still be centralised among the employers' associations and IG
Metall's federal organisation, or will it be decentralised in eastern
Germany, which, eventually, will have an impact on western Germany?'
IG Metall was yesterday adamant that it will go ahead and ballot its members
in eastern Germany in preparation for an all-out strike among the region's
steel and engineering sectors.
The strikes are aimed at putting pressure on Gesamtmetall, the metal and
electrical employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband, its steel
counterpart, to rescind their decision to end a contract for eastern wages
to be brought into line with those in the westby April 1994.
But the union yesterday admitted that it had not yet decided precisely
'where or when' the ballots would take place. 'The joint working parties on
pay will have to decide to ask for a ballot (in the companies),' said Mr
Jorg Barczynski, IG Metall's federal spokesman.
The union's hesitation in organising an all-out strike, even though it still
believes one is inevitable, stems from the conflicting pressures facing it
in the five eastern states. Several companies in eastern Germany, most
notably in the car, shipbuilding and privatised steel industry, have offered
26 per cent pay increases.
These concur with the original March 1991 contract between the employers, IG
Metall and eastern German enterprise managers.
'It will be difficult to bring these workers out,' an IG Metall official
said. But the union is reluctant to call off the strike because other
enterprises are offering 9 per cent, as recommended by the employers, or a
bit more. 'That would mean admitting the end of the contract which
Gesamtmetall broke,' said Mr Barczynski.
However, he added that IG Metall could envisage a situation where collective
wage bargaining in eastern Germany would be superseded by separate contracts
with individual enterprises.
It appears that IG Metall would be prepared to accept, in eastern Germany at
least, an end to the traditional system of collective wage bargaining
between employers and unions, even though it has repeatedly accused the
employers of wanting to use the wage conflict in eastern Germany to end that
system.
For its part, Gesamtmetall was yesterday adamant that it did not want to
break the collective wage bargaining system.
'Individual contracts may well happen in eastern Germany, but it is a
special case. It would not happen in the west,' an official said.

FT  14 APR 93 / Short-term rate eased by French bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday closed a chapter in the saga of its battle to
defend the franc by replacing its main short-term lending facility - the 12
per cent five-day repurchase rate - with a cheaper and more flexible 10-day
facility at 10 per cent.
Yesterday's rate reduction followed last week's fall in French money market
rates. It was greeted by a surge in the Paris stock market, with the CAC 40
index breaching the 2,000 barrier to close 1.57 per cent higher at 2,018.08.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new finance minister, said he was confident
interest rates would 'fall further in the days to come' and called on the
banks to cut the cost of their loans.
The franc firmed slightly, closing at 3.38 against the D-Mark; market rates
were relatively stable, with overnight money at 9.75 per cent and one-month
money at 9 per cent.
Economists cautioned that the reduction was really a corrective measure to
bring official interest rates down from their 'crisis' level in line with
market rates. They were sceptical about the prospect of immediate cuts in
bank base rates which have been held since January at 10 per cent, the same
level as the new ten-day rate.
'Technically, this cut is not very meaningful,' said Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'But it is an important
symbolic gesture.'
Despite the new conservative government's emphasis on a long-term policy of
lower interest rates, most economists suspect the French authorities will
wait for the Bundesbank to signal cuts in German rates, particularly as the
provisional inflation figures for March showed a 0.5 per cent increase,
slightly higher than expected, bringing the annual rate of French inflation
to 2.2 per cent.
'We certainly expect French rates to be far lower by the end of this year
and there could be another small cut in the short term,' said Ms Juliette
Brisac, economist at Paribas. 'But the next major move will come after
action from the Bundesbank.'
Yesterday's cut was welcome news for France's banks which have faced steep
increases in borrowing costs because of the gap between market rates, at
which they borrow money, and their own base rates. The French Banking
Association has estimated the cost to the industry at up to FFr1bn a day.
The banks are expected to try to recoup their losses before reducing base
rates. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, one of the biggest
banks, said in yesterday's Le Figaro that the banks were keen to cut rates
for competitive reasons but 'need to recover what they have lost'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR central bankers and treasury officials from the European Community
yesterday finished their report on the workings of the European exchange
rate mechanism after a 12-hour meeting.
Members of the EC monetary committee, meeting in Brussels, refused to give
details but confirmed that their analysis and recommendations would be
presented to Community finance ministers at a three-day informal council in
Kolding, Denmark, at the end of May.
'All's well that ends well,' said the Bank of England representative, Mr
Andrew Crockett, as he left the meeting.
The committee was asked to examine the workings of the exchange rate grid
following last September's currency crisis, during which both sterling and
the lira were forced out of the ERM.
Yesterday's meeting was held, as always, in secret, but the committee is
expected to recommend that there should be no fundamental reform of the
system - in spite of calls from member states, notably Britain, that alleged
'fault-lines' in the ERM should be treated.
Instead, the monetary experts believe existing rules - for example, those
which allow for more frequent technical realignments of European currencies
 -should be applied more strictly, and earlier, to avoid speculative
pressure on member currencies.

FT  14 APR 93 / Recall of Morillon sparks row: Colourful commander in Bosnia
not being punished, says Leotard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Francois Leotard, the new French defence minister, yesterday sparked a
political row by stating that he planned to recall General Philippe
Morillon, the colourful commander of the United Nations' peacekeeping force
in Bosnia.
The defence minister said on French radio that Gen Morillon, who is feted as
a folk hero in France, would be given a senior military post on his return.
'His human and professional qualities merit an important command,' Mr
Leotard said.
But United Nations officials in New York said they had heard nothing from
France about the possible replacement of General Morillon.
A spokesman said troop rotations were normal within the UN force 'and
certainly, as a French officer, the desires of his government would be
important in this regard'. But, he added: 'We still have received nothing
from the government of France regarding his replacement or a desire to
replace him. And to my knowledge the secretary-general has not been in touch
with him.'
In Paris, Mr Leotard denied that the general was being punished for
much-publicised personal initiatives in Bosnia, particularly his recent
mercy mission to Srebrenica aimed at opening the way to relief convoys and
protecting the local Moslem population from Serb attacks.
'Everyone including the prime minister and myself. . . wish to underline the
absolutely remarkable nature of the action he has undertaken,' Mr Leotard
said.
However, Mr Leotard's announcement came only a few days after Gen Morillon
had stated on French television that he planned to stay in Bosnia. He is now
expected to return to France by the end of this month. 'I'm amazed at the
little row that has developed around this officer,' Mr Leotard said,
stressing that he would ask his successor to take on similar humanitarian
initiatives in Bosnia.
However, the defence ministry refused to disclose who would replace Gen
Morillon or when his successor would be appointed. Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister, tried to defuse the controversy by stressing that
the general's return was routine. 'Every mission has a (terminal) date,' he
said. Mr Juppe denied allegations that Gen Morillon, who has been in Bosnia
for 13 months - at least twice as long as any of his predecessors - was
being withdrawn at the request of the Serbs.
Gen Morillon, known as 'Beau Geste' in France after the swashbuckling
fictional Foreign Legion officer immortalised by the English novelist PC
Wren, is a controversial figure both in France and abroad.
His admirers praise him for his courage in daring exploits such as his
defence of the Srebrenica Moslems. But his detractors see him as a
publicity-seeking egoist, claiming that his disregard for military procedure
has caused serious problems for the rest of the UN operation in Bosnia.
The United Nations aid airlift to Sarajevo will resume on Thursday after a
five-day suspension imposed due to a threat from Serb anti-aircraft guns, a
UN relief spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The UN has
scheduled 18 flights between Sarajevo and the Croatian port of Split and the
Italian port of Ancona.

FT  14 APR 93 / Aznar seeks to calm peseta fears: Spain's centre-right
leader is well-placed in polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE centre-right Spanish opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar tried
yesterday to calm investors' worries about conservative political and
economic priorities by promising to maintain a strong peseta within the
European monetary system.
With some opinion polls putting his Partido Popular (PP) slightly ahead of
the governing Socialists, following the calling of a snap general election
for June 6, he has come under strong pressure from advisers to tone down
attacks on the many orthodox elements of current economic policy.
Mr Aznar has previously threatened the peseta's permanence in the EMS,
largely in an attempt to capitalise on the problems which Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, the prime minister, has been having in controlling Spain's slide
into recession.
With both parties now fighting for the vital middle ground in Spanish
politics, the polls indicate, however, that neither Mr Aznar nor Mr Gonzalez
 -should he revitalise his badly divided party - will score an outright win
in the election.
Mr Aznar, 39, said he was confident of obtaining a 'sufficient majority',
indicating his readiness to govern in coalition with the middle-of-the-road
Catalan nationalist party. The Socialists make much the same kind of claims
for themselves.
Mr Aznar told a news conference that he ruled out a devaluation of the
peseta and intended to keep the currency within the exchange rate mechanism
of the EMS.
Acknowledging that it was markets and not governments that devalued
currencies, Mr Aznar said that, if elected, he would boost confidence in the
currency by implementing strict spending controls to reduce the budget
deficit.
The Partido Popular leader added that he would pursue an extensive
privatisation policy and that he would amend Socialist legislation currently
before parliament that has been sidelined by Mr Gonzalez's gamble on Monday
to call a snap general election.
A PP-led government, he said, would introduce changes to a controversial
draft strike law which employers contend is weighted heavily towards the
unions.
Mr Aznar said he would maintain a blueprint Socialist law that establishes
the autonomy of the Bank of Spain but that he reserved the right to name a
new governor of the bank when the law appeared on the statute book.
Mr Aznar's promises to 'make Spain fit again' and to 'turn a new page'
recalled those of Mr Gonzalez, 51, more than a decade ago when the now
embattled prime minister campaigned on the theme of 'change' and promised to
'make the country function'.
Spain is now in recession, as it was in 1982, and figures released yesterday
showed that last month a further 58,000 Spaniards registered at unemployment
offices.
This brought the official number of job-seekers to 2.5m, or 16.6 per cent of
the working population. In March last year the number registered at
unemployment offices dropped by nearly 11,000.
Mr Gonzalez, aware that the PP could already be the front-runner in the
polls, is preparing to stage a constant whistle-stop tour around the country
when the campaign opens officially in six weeks' time.
In the previous election in 1989 he held meetings only at weekends.
The prime minister is also understood to be manoeuvring to maintain key
ministers on the Socialists' electoral lists. At the heart of the party's
division is a bitter confrontation between Mr Gonzalez's moderate cabinet
and the left-leaning party machinery - led by Mr Alfonso Guerra, the deputy
party leader - which blames government economic policy for declining public
support.
The divide between the government and the party came to a head last week
when Mr Gonzalez, backed by several members of his cabinet, attempted to
force the resignation of leading party executives allegedly connected with
illicit campaign funding. The party machinery refused to allow the
dismissals but under an apparent compromise agreement handed the reins of
the electoral campaign over to the prime minister.
Many Socialists, however, already regard the period just after the elections
as almost as important to the party's future as the poll itself.
If Mr Gonzalez, who remains the country's most formidable campaigner, is
able to secure enough votes to enable the party to lead a coalition, it
seems likely that an emergency party congress would then be used to clear it
of many of Mr Guerra's supporters.
In the event that the Socialists lose, and the PP forms a government, it
seems unlikely that Mr Gonzalez would want to stay in politics and might
leave the party in the hands of its current left-wing managers.
Either way, analysts worry that whichever party forms a coalition with the
Catalan or Basque nationalists, these junior partners would demand high
prices - in terms of greater autonomy and more spending on their regions.
That, the markets fear, could make it very difficult for any new government
to control the country's growing budget deficits.

Mr Andreotti has said he will deliver a 100-page document to a committee of
23 senators, making clear his views on the request by Palermo magistrates to
lift his parliamentary immunity. The magistrates have filed more material
after new testimony from two Mafia informers living in the US. Press leaks
claim this includes details of alleged meetings between Mr Andreotti and
senior Mafia members.
Mr Giovanni Pellegrino, senate committee chairman, said he hoped for a
decision by the end of next week.

FT  14 APR 93 / UN asks EC for food aid to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata,
yesterday appealed urgently to European Community countries for food aid for
Bosnia, as officials warned the UN had practically run out of supplies to
feed the country's stricken population.
'We have only enough for one day,' Mr John Macmillan, UNHCR spokesman in
Sarajevo, said. Other UNHCR officials in Geneva said an average of only
three days' supplies were left in UN warehouses throughout former
Yugoslavia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said in response to Mrs Ogata's
appeal that Britain was pressing the European Commission to make available
food already approved by member countries. A UK official said his government
was deeply concerned by the aid situation in Bosnia and was 'disappointed'
other EC countries had not matched a British Pounds 15m emergency food aid
contribution last month.
A UN relief convoy which reached the besieged east Bosnian town of
Srebrenica yesterday evacuated 800 refugees, including 150 injured women and
children. UN officials confirmed 56 people had been killed on Monday by what
they called an outrageous artillery attack on the town by the Serbs. Mr
Macmillan claimed: 'In their drive to acquire territory, the Serbs are
willing to kill anybody to achieve their aims.'
His remarks were aimed, at, among others, the deputy commander of the
Bosnian Serb army, Gen Milan Gvero, who has accused the Moslem defenders of
Srebrenica of having improvised explosions to convince the UN that Serbs had
shelled the town.
Mr Barry Frewer, spokesman for UN protection forces in former Yugoslavia,
said the Unprofor commander, Gen Lars-Eric Wahlgren, had written to Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, to express his
revulsion at the attack.

FT  14 APR 93 / UK and China end deadlock on Hong Kong reform talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and SIMON DAVIES

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China are to hold talks in Beijing on April 22. The decision,
announced yesterday, breaks a five-month procedural deadlock over democratic
reforms for Hong Kong proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor.
The dispute over Mr Patten's reform programme, which has seen China heap
increasingly vicious personal abuse on the governor, threatened to embitter
the remaining years of British sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is to be
handed over to China in 1997.
China had also threatened to restrict trade between the two countries and to
veto big projects in Hong Kong, which Beijing says require its approval
under the 1984 Joint Declaration between the two countries.
Mr Patten refused to say whether China had changed its position on the
talks, merely describing the decision as 'a victory for common sense'. He
was speaking in London, where he had talks over lunch with Mr John Major,
the prime minister.
He said: 'I very much hope that we can come off at the end of the day with
an agreement on proposals which are fair and acceptable to the people of
Hong Kong.'
The announcement was anticipated in aggressive buying on the Hong Kong stock
and futures markets. Ahead of the news, the Hang Seng index closed 132.54 up
at 6,418.21. The April Hang Seng Index futures contract, a significant
barometer of short-term confidence, closed at an 82-point premium to the
Hang Seng, and Hong Kong shares were in great demand later in London,
suggesting that investors were expecting another strong performance today.
Although the agreement settles none of the fundamental issues raised by Mr
Patten's reforms, it appears to be a genuine compromise. China has accepted
the presence of three Hong Kong delegates in the British negotiating team.
It had previously rejected any Hong Kong participation.
Britain, for its part, appears to have agreed that the three Hong Kong
representatives should not play a direct part in the negotiations. The
British embassy in Beijing said they would be there 'to support' the British
representative, Sir Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to China.
Significantly, the colony's three representatives - Mr Michael Sze, Hong
Kong's secretary for constitutional affairs; Mr Peter Lai, his deputy; and
Mr William Ehrman, Mr Patten's political adviser - were not mentioned in the
joint statement announcing the talks in Beijing, although Mr Patten said
they were full members of the British team.
The talks, the first round of which is expected to last for four days, will
focus on the arrangements to be made for district board elections in the
colony in 1994 and elections to the Legislative Council (LegCo) in 1995.
LegCo, even under the Patten reforms, will continue to be only partly
composed of directly elected members. China has strongly objected to the
governor's proposals under which LegCo members representing so-called
'functional constituencies' (representing various functions or trades) will
be democratically elected.
Britain insists that the proposals are consistent with the Joint Declaration
and the Basic Law, China's mini-constitution for Hong Kong after the colony
reverts to Chinese rule. China has always said they contravene the Basic
Law.
Mr Patten has repeatedly made clear that he will respect the wishes of the
people of Hong Kong in the matter. His proposals will eventually be
submitted to LegCo and, if the legislative body rejects them, the governor
has promised to accept its verdict. That might be a face-saving procedure
for Britain.

FT  14 APR 93 / Japan unveils Pounds 76bn recovery plan: Tax and public
spending package lifts share prices and wins cautious US approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday unveiled a Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) economic package aimed at
reviving its troubled economy and combating protectionist pressures over the
growing Japanese trade surplus with America and Europe.
The package of public investment and tax concessions - the government's
second large boost to the economy in nine months - was greeted by a 4.3 per
cent surge in stock prices and a cautious welcome from US officials in Tokyo
for a meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations.
The Nikkei average closed above 20,000 for the first time in more than a
year. It ended 858.15 higher at 20,740.29, or 44 per cent above its August
low at the time of the previous package. Share prices were little changed in
early trading this morning.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the visiting US Treasury secretary, said yesterday Japan
was in the 'very fortunate position' of having the financial resources to
contribute to international growth.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party said the stimulus would ensure that the
country was set 'on the path to recovery'.
Japanese economic growth slumped to post-war lows over the past two years,
following the collapse in the Tokyo stock market in early 1990. Demand for
imports from the rest of the world fell while troubled Japanese banks dogged
by bad debts have cut international lending.
Business organisations welcomed the spending proposals, which, in raw terms,
exceeded the Y10,700bn announced in August. But retailers, looking to
rekindle consumer demand, were disappointed an income tax cut was not
included.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, said the package should enable the
country to meet its official forecast of 3.3 per cent growth for the fiscal
year, ending in March. But the plan is heavily weighted towards public works
investment, prompting concern among private economists that it could create
a spending bottleneck that will work against a balanced recovery.
Apart from Y4,170bn in fresh public works spending and Y1,600bn in early
purchases of land for public projects, the package includes a commitment to
contract at least 75 per cent of public works funds already budgeted for
this fiscal year by the end of the first half.
Other measures include:
Y1,150bn to be invested in 'social infrastructure'. The amount includes
funds for the purchase of technology by universities and medical institutes.
Y3,500bn in new investment by local governments. Y1,800bn in new funds for
government housing loan companies, and lower interest rates for borrowers
from those companies. Y1,910bn for government-affiliated financial
institutions which provide funds to small and medium-sized companies.
Mr Miyazawa plans to explain the details of the package to US President Bill
Clinton in Washington during a meeting scheduled for Friday. The Japanese
leader had insisted that the amount be decided before his departure for the
US, where Japan has been criticised for not encouraging economic growth.
But the US may raise questions about how much of the package is fresh money,
and how much is a front-loading of existing plans.
Mr Bentsen expressed 'hope' the package would cut the country's overall
trade surplus, and 'create a better balance in trade between Japan and the
US'.

FT  14 APR 93 / Rise in confidence lifts hopes of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK can look forward to an early economic recovery as sales and new order
books pick up and companies hire more staff, a business confidence survey
says today.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, reports that six out of
10 businesses expect sales to increase in the second quarter, against only
two expecting them to fall. The findings are significantly more optimistic
than in the previous quarter and will add to a growing impression that the
economy has reached a turning-point.
House prices have perked up recently, while car registrations for the first
quarter rose sharply compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile,
domestic air travel showed its steepest rise for more than a year during
March, indicating greater confidence among UK businesses which buy most of
the tickets for internal flights.
The latest traffic figures from the BAA, which operates London's airports
and three in Scotland, show a 5.5 per cent increase in domestic passenger
traffic last month compared with March 1992. Heathrow airport showed the
biggest gain in the south with an 8.3 per cent year-on-year rise in total
passengers to 3.8m last month. On the foreign exchanges the pound was
stronger against the D-Mark, closing 1 1/4 pfennigs higher at DM2.4625. In
New York, it finished at DM2.46025. Share prices were also more buoyant. The
FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 25 to 2,846.8.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which interviewed just under 2,000 managing directors
between March 17 and 31, reported that expectations about employment have
improved. More companies nationwide plan to hire staff than to fire them,
with optimism particularly high in London, the south-east, the east, Wales
and the north. The outlook is brightest in the service sector, with 35 per
cent reporting an intention to hire more staff against 19 per cent expecting
to cut back.
Although pressures on prices remain weak, the survey suggested that the
deflationary momentum of the economy was slowing. A higher proportion of
companies than in the previous quarter plan to pass on price increases to
customers, according to the survey. Half the companies, however, expect to
hold prices at last year's levels.
Official figures yesterday confirmed that producer price inflation remains
subdued although the effects of sterling's devaluation are continuing to put
pressure on manufacturers.
The Central Statistical Office reported that in March the prices of
manufactured goods leaving UK factories rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per
cent on the month. This left the annual rate of increase unchanged at 3.7
per cent. However, raw materials and fuel prices rose by 8.3 per cent in the
year to March, the highest rate of increase since July 1987.
The biggest jump in optimism was recorded among businesses in the service
sector. The optimism index, the percentage of respondents forecasting an
increase in sales minus the percentage expecting a decrease, leapt from 25
to 52. Confidence in the construction sector also rose.

FT  14 APR 93 / NUT votes for strike ballot over pay scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, yesterday
broadened its confrontation with the government by voting for a ballot on
industrial action over performance-related pay.
The move opens the possibility of strike action, if teachers in individual
local educational authorities are disciplined for refusing teacher appraisal
interviews, and adds to the controversy on the separate issue of boycotting
national curriculum tests for children.
It could also help the efforts of Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
to persuade parents that opposition to the tests is unprofessional and
politically motivated.
Delegates to the NUT's annual conference over-ruled the leadership and voted
by 89,105 votes to 82,472 to call for a boycott of interviews for teachers'
appraisal, which is necessary for the planned introduction of
performance-related pay. One delegate told the conference the pay scheme was
a 'creep's charter', and the union should oppose it with 'all means
possible'.
Mr Patten, who described the decision as 'very regrettable', said: 'Strikes,
boycotts and disruption of all kinds are not what parents want to hear from
professionals and can only damage children's education.'
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, tried to play down the move,
and said a boycott by teachers of their appraisal interviews would not
affect children. He said the union did not oppose appraisal for teachers,
but only its link with performance-related pay.
The NUT will now hold two separate ballots next term - the first on testing,
and the second on teachers' appraisal.
Other teachers' unions and opposition politicians believed the move would
deflect attention from the boycott of tests for children under the national
curriculum, which seems likely to be enforced by the three biggest teachers'
unions.
Mr Nigel De Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said: 'It's a tactical error. On the
issue of testing we've got the whole world on our side, apart from Mr Patten
and the cabinet.' Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman,
said the move would blunt the campaign against the tests.
Mr Patten's efforts to save this year's tests received a modest boost
yesterday from MPs on the cross-party select committee of education, who
decided not to inquire into his handling of the national curriculum tests.

FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Sundstrand, Rockwell
International deal falls through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sundstrand said that its tentative agreement to sell its commercial avionics
business to Rockwell International for dollars 225m had fallen through,
AP-DJ reports.
Sundstrand said it had 'terminated negotiations' with Rockwell after the two
companies had been unable to reach a mutually acceptable definitive
agreement. It said it would purchase its options, including the sale of the
1,300-employee unit to other interested parties. The division makes flight
data recorders and cockpit devices. Sundstrand had earlier said it expected
to use proceeds from the sale to repurchase up to 4m, or 11 per cent, of its
outstanding common shares

FT  13 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Oil storage tank for BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture between COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING and TAYLOR
WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded a Pounds 50m contract for the
design, construction and installation of a gravity oil storage tank for BP
Exploration's Forth Field development.
The 70,000 ton concrete tank will be built in a dry dock at Hunterston
before being floated out and installed on the seabed in the North Sea, 220
miles north-east of Aberdeen.
The T-shaped tank for BP is designed to fulfil three functions. It will act
as a storage tank for the Forth Field, capable of holding 500,000 barrels of
crude oil, it will form the base for a heavy-duty tripod jack-up production
platform and its topside facilities, and it will also serve as a drilling
template through which 24 wells can be drilled from the platform into the
oil reservoir.
Construction will start in the Autumn, with completion followed by tow-out
and installation scheduled for June 1995.
The gravity base tank will measure 115 metres by 120 metres, comprising 80
roofed interconnecting slip-formed cells 19 metres in height.
The jack-up will be founded on three circular slip-formed towers, each 19
metres in diameter and 13 metres in height, constructed on the cellular
base. Buoyancy tanks for the float-out from the dry dock will later be used
as ballast boxes prior to installation, to ensure stability even under the
worst North Sea storm conditions. The contract includes all mechanical and
electrical work required for the ballasting and oil management systems
within the gravity base tank.

FT  13 APR 93 / Chernobyl reactor shut down after engine malfunction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The No 1 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine was shut
down yesterday because of a malfunction in the turbine engine, the Itar-Tass
news agency said. There was no danger of any radiation being released,
according Mr Viktor Vasilchenko, chief engineer at the complex.
The plant has four graphite reactors. Reactor No 4, which exploded in 1986,
has been encased in a steel-and-concrete 'sarcophagus', and reactor No 2 has
been shut down since a fire in 1991.
Mr Vasilchenko said the generator at Chernobyl was being repaired. He said
yesterday's incident ranked 'zero' on the International Atomic Agency's
seven-point scale, meaning it posed no danger.
It is the second shutdown because of malfunction at the Chernobyl complex
since March 1. In 1991, there were 270 shutdowns at nuclear plants in the
former Soviet Union, according to the State Atomic Security Commission.

FT  13 APR 93 / Georgia, Ukraine to hold talks: Shevardnadze wants
counterweight to 'third force'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIAN leader Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Ukraine yesterday for talks
aimed at forging a joint political front against Russia, Reuter reports from
Kiev.
Mr Shevardnadze, who has accused Russia of aiding separatists in Georgia's
Black Sea region of Abkhazia, headed straight for talks with Ukrainian
President Leonid Kravchuk after flying in.
'This is the beginning of the construction of new relations between
independent states,' he told reporters. 'There are of course high hopes.'
The Georgian leader, a former Soviet foreign minister, set the tone for
discussions in a weekend interview, saying Georgia and Ukraine had a joint
interest in acting as a counterweight to an unnamed 'third force'.
'We were forced into this war. Separatism has taken root over several
decades thanks to the special interests of a third force,' he said in an
interview with Georgian television. 'I believe Ukraine understands full well
this third force is interested in destabilising not only Georgia.'
Georgia says the continued presence of Russian troops on its territory is
hindering a settlement in Abkhazia, where hundreds have been killed in the
past eight months.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has been locked in disputes
with Russia on issues ranging from ownership of the Black Sea fleet to the
future of Ukraine's share of the Soviet nuclear arsenal and repayment of
Soviet debt.
Kiev, generally suspicious of its northern neighbour after three centuries
of Moscow rule, has accused the Kremlin of high-handedness and intimidation
in its dealings with Ukraine.
Mr Shevardnadze and Mr Kravchuk are due to sign about 20 documents,
including a treaty on friendship and co-operation, which the Georgian leader
said could extend to 'mutual assistance'.
'I think this is indisputably the correct approach. Our national interests,
our strategic interests coincide fully. We can in real terms speak about
friendship and mutual assistance,' Mr Shevardnadze said.
A senior adviser to Mr Kravchuk also said the visit could help combat undue
outside influence on both countries.
Mr Kravchuk yesterday sacked the head of the Kiev city administration, who
has often been compared to Russian President Boris Yeltsin for his
rebellious, populist campaigns against authority.
Mr Kravchuk formally dismissed Mr Ivan Saliy for his refusal to move the
administration out of its imposing headquarters to make way for the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. The two men had clashed repeatedly on how the
city of 2.5m was run.

FT  13 APR 93 / Romanians seek haven abroad: Virginia Marsh writes on the
rush to escape poverty at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADRIAN, a 32-year-old engineer, has just lost his life savings of Dollars
1,400 - more than double the average Romanian's annual salary - in an
unsuccessful effort to enter Germany smuggled in a Turkish lorry over the
Czech border.
Adrian's story is by no means unique. He is one of more than 1,500 Romanians
who were expelled from Germany last month after trying to enter the country
illegally.
Others have been more successful. More than 500,000 Romanians are believed
to have emigrated since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December
1989.
The reasons for emigration are now primarily economic, according to Mr
Padraig Czajkowski, head of the Bucharest office of the Geneva-based
International Organisation for Migration (IMO).
'Before 1992 many, typically the well educated, left for political as well
as economic reasons. They had either been prevented from leaving in the
communist period or else they became quickly disenchanted with the new
regime,' he says.
'With unemployment and real incomes declining, disillusionment is moving
down the social scale. The less skilled are trying to get out too.'
He points to the flood of labourers and rural workers who came forward last
month after Argentina invited applications from Romanian settlers. The
Argentine embassy in Bucharest handed out 25,000 immigration forms over
three weeks.
Emigration has also been spurred by realisation that Romania's transition to
a market economy will take longer and be more painful than originally
anticipated.
An IOM poll taken last year indicated nearly 30 per cent of Romanians did
not intend to stay in the country. A further 46 per cent said they had
considered moving abroad.
'Reforms in Romania have not progressed as quickly as in the central
European countries,' says a Canadian embassy official. 'The young are
generally the most unhappy about this. They tell us they want to experience
the New World today and not in 20 years' time.'
The under-30s, who form the bulk of those trying to leave, have also been
hard hit by unemployment. Labour Ministry figures show that, in February, 55
per cent of the unemployed were under the age of 30. Fewer than 8 per cent
were over 50.
The US, Canada and Germany are the most popular destinations for would-be
emigrants.
'In Berlin, I can earn DM2,000 per month. It's worth the risk of being
caught,' says Nicolae, a 30-year-old computer programmer, who has been to
work in Germany twice. He has used the money to set up his own company in
Buch-arest.
'Many are still ignorant about the realities of life in the west, They hear
that German social security is DM600 per month and think they can live on
DM200 and save the rest,' says Mr Hubertus Thoma, head of consular affairs
at the German embassy in Bucharest.
Last year, 104,000 Romanians sought asylum in Germany, accounting for a
quarter of all applications. A further 220,000 were granted visitor visas.
Other western countries have found that many Romanians overstay their visas.
Around 50 per cent of those given US visitor visas stay on illegally,
according to the US embassy in Bucharest.
Diplomats also report a growing trade in forged visas and passports. 'The
going rate for a stolen EC or US passport is around Dollars 500,' says a US
embassy official.
More worrying is the increase in human traffic. Adrian may have lost his
life savings but he admits things could have been worse.
Others have been found dead on arrival after suffocating in sealed container
trucks.
Mr Czajkowski of the IOM believes many more will take similar risks as
economic pressures build up.
'The situation in Romania is desperate enough. In the Commonwealth of
Independent States, it is worse and likely to deteriorate further.
'With Romania we are dealing with a population of 23m, with the CIS 10 times
more. The west will find it difficult to keep these people out.'

against debt - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses frequently take out credit insurance to cover exports but rarely
use it for their domestic sales, despite the growing risk of UK customers
going bust or delaying payment.
Barclays Bank has launched a short-term credit insurance scheme called
Barclays Sales Protection, intended to cover domestic sales but applicable
also to exports, in the hope of increasing interest.
The new scheme is available to limited companies with annual sales of at
least Pounds 250,000 and a good record of credit management. Premiums
normally cost less than Pounds 1 for every Pounds 100 of cover. The scheme
pays up to 90 per cent of outstanding debts six months after the invoice due
date.

FT  13 APR 93 / The FT Interview: New voice for familiar lines - Goh Chok
Tong, Singapore's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing worse than coming on stage after a star performer. Mr Goh
Chok Tong knows the feeling well.
Since he took over as Singapore's prime minister from Mr Lee Kuan Yew in
November 1990, Mr Goh has faced constant comparisons with his predecessor's
achievements during his 30 years of rule.
Under Mr Lee the island republic was transformed from a colonial backwater
into a thriving city state, with one of the best standards of living in
Asia. Income per head is now more than Dollars 12,000, one of the highest in
the region and approaching the levels of Italy and the UK.
Mr Goh admits Mr Lee is a hard act to follow. 'The prime minister's job is a
huge one. It has been made even larger by Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Any successor
will find the shoes he has left too big.'
But the prime minister has signalled his intention to step out of his
predecessor's shadow. 'I do not intend to wear his shoes. I shall be myself
and set my own style . . .'
This style, he argues, is a more open and consultative. There is more
discussion of policy, he says - at least at the cabinet level of government.
'Sometimes ideas come from him (Mr Lee), sometimes it's from the other
ministers, very often it's from me.'
Mr Goh has also sought to ease the strict regimentation of Singaporean
society, relaxing stiff restrictions on some slightly risque films. The
carefully controlled Singapore media has been allowed to indulge in some
mild criticism of official policies.
Such moves have brought change to the island, Mr Goh says. 'There's a
livelier arts scene. We set up a censorship committee. That's not just
style. It came with several recommendations which we've accepted. Local
plays now don't get edited by the ministry of information and arts.'
For most observers, however, the extent of change has been limited. Part of
the reason is the lingering influence of Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee took on the
role of senior minister in Mr Goh's cabinet and still exercises a strong
influence on policy. A 1991 ban on chewing gum - apparently because it might
cause the doors on Singapore's ultra modern mass transit system to stick -
is pointed to by opponents of the ruling People's Action Party as an example
of the perpetuation of Mr Lee's intrusive policies.
But the modest nature of change also reflects a basic agreement between Mr
Goh and Mr Lee over the conduct of politics. In particular, Mr Goh shares
his predecessor's toughness when it comes to dealing with perceived threats
to the smooth running of Singapore.
As deputy prime minister between 1985 and 1990 Mr Goh clamped down on a
group of people who were campaigning for more rights for foreign workers in
Singapore. The government said a Marxist conspiracy was afoot: several
arrests were made.
Mr Goh was also responsible in the late 1980s for restricting the
circulation of foreign publications such as the Asian Wall Street Journal
and the Far Eastern Economic Review for publishing articles which the
government believed could cause disruption in Singapore.
Such toughness, combined with his administrative capabilities lie behind Mr
Goh's rise through the political establishment. Working his way steadily up
the political ladder he became part of a group of 'second generation'
leaders who were being prepared to take over from Mr Lee.
But Mr Goh was not Mr Lee's first choice as prime minister. Like a Chinese
company patriarch, Mr Lee had groomed his son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, for the
post of prime minister. Mr Lee junior, a reserve brigadier-general known as
'BG' Lee, had made a name for himself as minister of trade and industry and
one of Singapore's two deputy prime ministers. Mr Goh was portrayed as a
'seat warmer' - an interim appointment until 'BG' Lee, still only in his
early 40s, was thought ready for office.
Mr Goh's initial political fortunes did nothing to ease the impression that
his leadership would be temporary. In general elections called in mid 1991
by Mr Goh, the PAP saw its vote fall to the lowest level since the late
1960s. The opposition won its strongest showing in parliament. Although the
PAP still managed to win 77 of the 81 seats and 61 per cent of the popular
vote, the result was regarded as a blow to the party which has dominated
Singaporean politics since independence in 1965.
But circumstances then buttressed Mr Goh's position. Last November it was
announced that both 'BG' Lee and Ong Teng Cheong, another deputy prime
minister, had cancer. Mr Goh found himself in an entirely new position, no
longer an interim appointment but a more permanent fixture. In a renewed
attempt to gain what he considered a satisfactory political mandate, Mr Goh
called a by-election last December in his own constituency. This time, the
PAP won 72 per cent of the vote.
At the same time the prime minister took over the post of PAP secretary
general from Mr Lee and put his own people in principal positions.
Mr Goh now appears far more politically comfortable than a year ago. 'I see
myself in this job for some time to come, even had there been nothing wrong
with deputy prime minister Lee.'
According to Mr Goh, 'BG' Lee has responded well to cancer treatment and
will return to his full role in government in the near future. Then, what
many see as a battle for power between Mr Goh and the younger Lee could be
resumed.
If a contest does emerge, Mr Goh will find his position strengthened by
Singapore's improved economic circumstances. Fears early last year of an
economic slowdown due to recession in Singapore's main export markets have
evaporated. The Singapore economy grew by 5.8 per cent last year. Growth of
6-7 per cent is projected for this year.
Mr Goh argues that continued strong economic performance is his principal
concern. Without it, he fears that the stability of the island republic
might be threatened.
'I think that is part of our misfortune,' says Mr Goh. We've got to worry
all the time. If we lose our competitive edge, I think the whole house may
collapse. To give an example, if we are not competitive, say, with China,
we'll find that China will suck in our investments very quickly . . . a
hollowing out of the economy may take place very quickly . . . this anxiety
element is something we've got to live with.'
Anxieties about competitiveness colour other areas of government policy. The
government eschews welfarism. 'We believe that if a person is given welfare,
then why should he work very hard?' says Mr Goh. 'It affects the diligence
and the competitiveness of the individual and the nation.'
Critics in the opposition parties argue that such views ignore the fact that
there are many in Singapore who need help. They say that while some have
doubtless benefited from Singapore's intensely competitive environment, many
have fallen by the wayside.
A survey of Singapore's majority Chinese community conducted by the PAP
itself identified more than 250,000 people (out of total population of 2.8m)
who were 'under-achievers', in need of government help.
Singapore's rulers are also accused by domestic political opponents of
creating and perpetuating an elitist society. In the 1960s Mr Lee selected
the best and brightest to run Singapore's government and bureaucracy. They
worked hard and grew wealthy in the process. Those achievers can now afford
to send their children to expensive schools and to overseas universities.
Mr Goh heartily endorses the system. 'That's not elitism. We shouldn't hold
anything against the children of parents who have done well. That's part of
meritocracy.'
It could almost be Mr Lee speaking. Such emphasis on competitiveness,
stability and meritocracy echo the incessant pronouncements of the island's
elder statesman. Mr Goh is the new figure at the centre of the Singapore
stage. But he is still familiar with Mr Lee's script.

FT  13 APR 93 / A timid deficit reduction plan: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton unveiled his economic plan in February, my
response was sceptical, bordering on hostile. Release of the full budget
last week did nothing to dispel my reservations, although it is heartening
that Congress is baulking at the least defensible elements of the plan, such
as the short-term fiscal stimulus and the temporary business tax credit: an
economy growing at 3 per cent does not need an artificial boost. However, I
remain puzzled that the weak deficit-reduction proposals are so universally
applauded.
The planned Dollars 514bn of budget 'cuts' over five years are hailed as a
monumental triumph - the biggest deficit reduction package in US history.
But look more closely. The structural budget deficit (the deficit adjusted
to reflect cyclical changes in economic activity) falls moderately in fiscal
1994 - to Dollars 205bn against an estimated Dollars 252bn this year. But
thereafter Mr Clinton makes absolutely no progress. The structural deficit
steadily rises to Dollars 242bn in fiscal 1998, or 3 per cent of gross
domestic product. Seven years into an economic upturn, the underlying
deficit is higher relative to national income than in the late 1980s.
The debt-to-GDP ratio, which Mr Clinton once promised to reduce, is
projected to rise steadily - from 51 per cent last year to 58 per cent in
fiscal 1998.
Congress can approve so many cuts and still fail to reduce the structural
deficit because the US is a decade or more behind other countries in its
handling of budgets. It still lives in the era of 'funny money': cuts are
measured relative to the so-called 'current services' baseline, which
assumes that cash spending is passively increased to reflect increases in
the cost of public services and the number of recipients.
When Mr Clinton talks about cutting Medicare, the health programme for the
elderly, he is proposing to increase spending by 62 per cent in cash terms
over five years, rather than the 75 per cent assumed in the current services
baseline. This is the kind of austerity that a Democratic-controlled
Congress can readily endorse.
Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, says the likely decline in
the deficit is understated because the budget uses especially conservative
assumptions on growth and interest rates. Her own more optimistic forecasts
indicate the federal deficit could fall as low as Dollars 160bn in fiscal
1997 (rather than the Dollars 214bn in the budget documents) compared with
Dollars 322bn this year, thus fulfilling Mr Clinton's campaign pledge to
'halve the deficit' in four years.
A strong recovery might indeed cut the deficit quickly. But if structural
problems are not addressed, it would provide only a temporary reprieve -
akin to the miraculous British surpluses of the late 1980s.
My scepticism centres on the credibility of the spending projections.
President George Bush wanted a smaller federal government but ended up
presiding over an increase in expenditure of nearly 30 per cent in four
years - in spite of curbs in defence spending.
Mr Clinton is an enthusiastic proponent of bigger government and is
launching a range of expensive - and largely unfunded - programmes, from big
infrastructure projects to the National Service plan to subsidise college
education. Yet he wants us to believe that the total increase in spending
can be held to only 15 per cent over four years, half the rate of increase
under President Bush.
This hardly seems plausible, especially if you allow for the restructuring
of healthcare, a sector that accounts for nearly a seventh of the economy.
While intended to curb costs in the longer run, the reforms planned by the
White House threaten a steep increase in spending over the next few years.
Extending coverage to the 15 per cent of the population now uninsured and
guaranteeing everybody a generous package of benefits that includes items
such as mental health care and long-term nursing home care (which are not
included in most existing private insurance schemes) could cause an
explosive increase in demand for medical services. And in the approach to
the 1994 mid-term congressional elections, it is doubtful that Mr Clinton
will offset these pressures with draconian controls on doctors and
hospitals.
The revenue side of the equation is no more robust. To fund an extension of
government services, Mr Clinton needs either an across-the-board increase in
income taxes or a broad-based consumption levy, such as the European value
added tax.
He is instead relying on sharp increases in marginal rates on the top 1 per
cent and a narrow energy tax. The rich will dodge higher taxes either by
simply reporting less income or by converting it into capital gains, which
will be taxed at the old lower rate. Congress, meanwhile, is likely to scale
back the already modest energy tax.
The White House claims that more aggressive attempts to curb the deficit
would only imperil the economic recovery. Yet if it is safe to cut the
structural deficit by more than Dollars 40bn next year why are similar cuts
not possible in later years when the recovery, presumably, will be more
mature? The truth is that the Clinton administration, contrary to its
rhetoric, has yet to start making hard decisions on either spending or
taxes.

FT  13 APR 93 / No farewell to arms yet: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the cold war collapsed, the two superpowers marked the revolution in
world history by agreeing deep cuts in their nuclear weapons, in the two
Start treaties of 1991 and 1992. If these are ratified and implemented, the
US and Russia should reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals from around
11,000-12,000 warheads to some 3,000-3,500 by the year 2003. Of course, even
3,000 warheads would be more than enough to blow the world to smithereens.
Nevertheless, it really seemed as though the nuclear shadow might be
receding. Some people even leaped to the extravagant conclusion that nuclear
arms control had gone about as far as it could go.
It has not taken long for such euphoria to look crassly premature. For one
thing, the Start treaties may themselves be capsized in the back-wash of the
disintegration of the Soviet Union. For another, North Korea, which has
certainly not recognised the end of the cold war, has decided to make its
own bit of history, by walking out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
The Start treaties are in jeopardy, because Ukraine appears to be drawing
back from earlier undertakings to become a non-nuclear state, and it has not
yet committed itself to surrender to Russia the inter-continental missiles
and bombers which belonged to the former Soviet Union and were based in
Ukrainian territory.
Ukraine's strategic motives are not entirely clear. It may believe that this
arsenal of 176 ICBMs and 34 bombers could give them an ultimate security
guarantee amid the manifold uncertainties of the region. On the other hand,
it may just be holding on its nuclear weaponry as a bargaining chip, either
to exchange against foreign financial aid, or to secure some form of
security guarantee from the west.
Either way, Ukraine is playing ducks and drakes with the fragile structures
of arms control. It is hanging back on the ratification of the 1991 Start-1
nuclear weapons treaty; and so long as Ukraine fails to ratify Start-1,
Start-2 cannot be ratified, and will obviously not be implemented. Moreover,
Ukraine is delaying signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is the
bedrock of the international nuclear arms control regime.
The purpose of this treaty, signed in 1968, was to restrict the spread of
nuclear weapons, by having two categories of signatories - a handful of
states with nuclear weapons which would undertake not to supply them to
other countries, and a large number of non-nuclear states, which would
undertake to remain so.
Ukraine's delay in signing the NPT may well be an indication that it has not
yet decided whether to claim the status of a nuclear-weapon state. But its
hesitations can hardly fail to threaten the credibility of the arms control
regimes. Some observers fear that Ukraine's example could have a knock-on
effect on Kazakhstan, which also inherited ICBM nuclear missiles from the
Soviet Union, and might be induced to follow Ukraine's example.
The North Korean case is the other side of the coin. It joined the NPT in
1985 as a non-nuclear-weapon state, and as such is subject to inspection by
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But it seems that North Korea
may have been working on a nuclear bomb project on the sly. The US had
suspected this for some time. The IAEA started detecting disturbing evidence
last autumn, and earlier this year demanded to inspect secret facilities in
Yongbyon. The North Koreans staged an indignant refusal, and then announced
they were walking out of the NPT (as they are entitled to do). The IAEA has
denounced the North Koreans, and has reported them to the United Nations
Security Council.
But it is unlikely the council will be able to settle the issue. For one
thing, the Chinese (who have their own reasons for resisting UN interference
in the internal affairs of member states) will almost certainly veto
sanctions. In any case, sanctions are unlikely to have much effect on the
closed regime of North Korea.
Over the years the NPT has had more than its share of success. Most UN
members are members. After long resistance, France and China have finally
signed up as weapon states. South Africa has signed up as a non-weapon state
after secretly developing, and then secretly abandoning, a nuclear weapon
programme.
The problem is that the North Korean case shows clearly the imperfections of
the NPT as a bulwark against the spread of nuclear arms. Iraq is a treaty
signatory, and certainly had (and indeed may still have) a secret nuclear
weapons programme. Iran is a signatory, and probably it has nuclear
ambitions too.
Moreover, the discipline of the NPT seems likely to decline in future.
First, nuclear technology will become increasingly accessible to any country
which can muster the economic and scientific resources. Second, there is a
danger that Soviet nuclear weapons will be sold secretly to developing
countries. There are reports that at least one weapon has already been sold
to Iran. Third, the end of the cold war means that the restraining effect of
the superpower confrontation has been withdrawn, and so regional conflicts
become more likely.
The real test of the NPT is how long it can survive as a treaty dividing the
world into the haves and the have-nots. As the price for their self-denial,
the have-nots have put a number of demands to the nuclear states, including
a ban on testing and deep cuts in arsenals. These conditions will be put to
the test in 1995, when the treaty formally expires. If the signatories do
not decide to extend it, we could be in for the kind of nuclear arms race
which the superpowers have just given up.

FT  13 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: A stronger pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOCUS in currency markets may be back on sterling this week after
several months in which the pound has been in the doldrums, writes James
Blitz.
In the last week, the pound has shown new strength against the dollar and
the D-Mark. On Thursday evening, it closed at DM2.4500 against the D-Mark
and at 80.1 per cent on the Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index,
which measures the pound against its 1985 value.
This was only the third time since January that the currency has been above
80 per cent on the ERI.
A raft of economic indicators could take the pound even higher this week.
The inflation figures due out on Friday are expected to be more or less
unchanged, while manufacturing output and industrial production numbers, due
out on Wednesday, should show a modest rise.
But several factors could also undermine sterling's rise.
First, a stronger currency may trigger new speculation in the money markets
that the UK authorities will cut interest rates. With the Bundesbank easing
rates in what one analyst calls 'weekly salami slices,' any thought of an
easing in UK monetary policy will undermine the currency.
Secondly, the UK authorities may not want the pound to rise too far. Recent
surveys have highlighted the importance of sterling's devaluation in
boosting the confidence of exporters.
In the view of economists at NatWest Markets in London, sterling may also be
undermined by the Bank of England's continuing need to build up its foreign
currency reserves following the Black Wednesday debacle. As the currency
approaches DM2.50 against the D-Mark, the Bank of England may take the
opportunity to sell the pound and buy the German currency.

FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Further decline in bond
yields lifts equities
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
ANOTHER big decline in bond yields, earned in the wake of more good
inflation news, lifted US share prices across the board yesterday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.61 at 3,428.09,
near its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended up 6.12 at 447.96, while the Amex composite finished 1.84 higher at
418.08 and the Nasdaq composite up 6.79 at 673.12. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 260m shares.
Equity investors drew strength from the fixed-income markets, where last
Friday's news of a 0.1 per cent increase in March consumer prices prompted
heavy buying. The benchmark 30-year government bond rose sharply, pushing
the yield down to 6.79 per cent.
Two weeks ago yields were heading beyond 7 per cent on fears of revived
inflation. Stock markets were worried that this might hinder economic
recovery. In the last week, however, good news on consumer and producer
prices has seen yields retreat convincingly.
Enthusiasm was tempered, however, by concern about the approaching reporting
season. A handful of companies has already posted first-quarter earnings,
but until a fuller picture of corporate profitability, investors will remain
cautious.
Among individual stocks, banks were firmer in the wake of lower interest
rates. Chemical rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 , Chase Manhattan
firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 , First Chicago rose Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 43 7/8 , BankAmerica added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 52 1/2 and Banc
One rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 60.
General Motors fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 in busy trading as
investors responded to Friday's news that a preliminary National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration inquiry had found safety defects in GM pickup
trucks built with 'side-saddle' fuel tanks. GM argued that its trucks were
built to federal safety standards, and denied the administration's request
that the company recall all 4.7m of the trucks built between 1973 and 1987.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 117 1/2 in heavy
trading after it reported strong first-quarter profits.
Canada
TORONTO closed higher in quiet trading. The TSE-300 index rose 23.21 points
to close at 3615.01 in volume of 40.3m shares. Trading value was CDollars
345.8m.
South Africa was closed for a public holiday.

FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
as Seoul advances to an 18-month high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS remained inactive ahead of the government's fiscal stimulus
package announcement, expected today, and share prices fell marginally amid
low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 10.04 to 19,882.14, having risen to the day's high
of 19,940.37 in the first hour of trading before falling on arbitrage
related selling, and hitting the day's low of 19,740.53 in the afternoon.
However, late arbitrage buying erased some of the losses.
Volume fell from Friday's 761m shares to 330m, the lowest level in three
weeks. Traders attributed the dull trading to the absence of foreign
investors, who have been leading the recent rally, because of the Easter
holidays.
Declines led gains by 606 to 405 with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 7.87 to 1,555.41.
Investors also cited the yen's advance against the dollar as an excuse to
remain on the sidelines. The dollar closed at a new Tokyo low of Y112.95,
down Y0.20 from Friday. The higher yen prompted profit-taking in exporting
sectors such as high-technology and car manufacturers.
Traders said that investors were placing funds into smaller stocks.
'Rotation buying, which has accounted for the gains in many first section
sectors, has now moved into other sections,' said Baring Securities.
The second section rose 9.17 to 2,018.12 and the over-the-counter market
advanced 18.09 to 1,597.66.
Electronics issues lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y869 and
Sony retreated Y40 to Y4,800. Toyota Motor also lost Y10 to Y1,690 on the
higher yen.
Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y2 to Y393, while Japan
Airlines, which had surged last week on bargain hunting, lost Y12 to Y758.
Profit-taking depressed banks and brokers. Sumitomo Bank fell Y30 to Y2,000,
while Nomura Securities lost Y80 to Y2,090. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
closed unchanged at Y1.03m, after falling briefly below Y1m on
profit-taking.
Some gainers included speculative issues, with Cosmo Oil, the oil refiner,
up Y10 to Y822 on rumours that the company has become an acquisition target
for a large Saudi Arabian conglomerate. Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry
rose Y78 to Y763 on reports that it will start mass-producing biodegradable
plastics next year.
On the second section, Oriental Photo Industrial surged Y54 to Y404 and
Maruhachi Warehouse gained Y55 to Y535. In Osaka, the OSE average fell
123.91 to 21,452.49 in volume of 15.7m shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of markets on the Pacific Rim remained closed yesterday.
SEOUL finished at its highest level for 18 months on strong buying by
individuals, and the composite index climbed 12.63 to 720.96. Turnover was
strong at Won933.2bn, up from Won512.8bn in Saturday's half-day session.
Small and medium sized companies gained momentum aided by a government
decision to provide financial assistance of some Won1.4 trillion.
BOMBAY fell sharply in spite of curbs on selling imposed by the stock
exchange and the BSE index closed down 88.22 at 2,222.69, the first day of
the new account. Some analysts commented that investors remained
disappointed at the lack of an anticipated interest rate cut last week.
SINGAPORE shed some of last week's gains on profit-taking with the Straits
Times Industrial index falling 10.56 to 1,707.84. Some investors commented
that Malaysian speculative shares were still active, but demand had shrunk
from last week's levels. KUALA LUMPUR was helped by a late rally in Telekom
which left the composite index up 1.89 at 657.13.
TAIWAN continued to ease following its rise to a 12-month high last week.
The weighted index closed 16.59 lower at 4,682.27 as turnover fell to
TDollars 32.7bn, its lowest level for nearly two months. Buying interest was
weak with many investors believing that the market will consolidate with a
downward bias in the near term.
MANILA was stronger on renewed optimism for the economy. The composite index
rose 8.76 to 1,564.89 as turnover declined to 334m pesos.

THE majority of bourses remained closed for the Easter holiday yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID made a slight advance on news that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime

FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Carmakers diverge as Germany loses
impetus - How Daimler and Volkswagen characterise the change in Frankfurt
sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was only in January this year that Prof Ekkehard Wenger, a professor in
business studies at the university of Wurzburg in northern Bavaria and a
noted shareholder activist, launched a wholly unsuccessful attempt to get
rid of Mercedes Holdings.
At the company's annual meeting, the full might of the German corporate and
financial establishment combined to prevent the dissolution of MAH, a
company which had no raison d'etre but to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in
Daimler-Benz and act as a block to an unfriendly takeover.
Prof Wenger may have lost the vote; but he won the argument. Eleven days
ago, Daimler said it had reached agreement to get rid of MAH by the end of
the year. Shares in MAH - which has a separate stock-market listing and has
nothing to do with the Mercedes-Benz car manufacturing company - are to be
converted into Daimler-Benz shares on a one-for-one basis.
The move was clearly connected with the announcement earlier in the week
that Daimler had reached agreement with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission
over the terms of a listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
In future, Daimler will present its accounts according to US rules, thereby
publishing more financial information than is usual for German companies.
The first effect of the announcement was to cause a sharp drop in the
Daimler share price and a correspondingly sharp increase in the MAH price.
MAH shares have traditionally had a 20 to 25 discount to the Daimler shares,
reflecting MAH shareholders' lack of a direct vote in Daimler. This discount
shrunk significantly over the course of a few days, while the Daimler share
price was unsettled on fears that some large holdings in MAH were now up for
sale.
But Daimler moves can still be interpreted as positive for investors in the
German market. By abandoning an antiquated ownership structure, which was
put together in 1975 to prevent the Shah of Iran buying the bulk of the 39
per cent Daimler stake owned by the industrialist, Mr Karl Friedrich Flick,
Daimler is responding to the expectations of international, performance
oriented investors.
It may thereby set a trend which may encourage other German companies to pay
more than lip-service to the notion of 'shareholder-value'. As Mr Ronaldo
Schmitz, the board director of Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate
finance, commented a few weeks ago, 'shareholder value' ought to mean
aggressive management of assets according to strict financial criteria - not
just public relations designed to talk up the share price.
Similarly, the New York listing should ensure that management action will
become more open to market scrutiny than ever before. Other German companies
will be obliged to follow suit, if they want to raise equity capital on as
favourable terms as Daimler, with direct access to the investment resources
of US institutions, may one day achieve.
For Daimler, this means that financial performance may take on a higher
priority than in past years when a massive expansion programme coincided
with earnings stagnation, and worse.
How much worse became clear on Tuesday this week when Daimler announced its
expected drop in profits from DM1.94bn in 1991 to DM1.45bn for 1992  - and
Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, said that they would fall as low as DM1bn
in the current year as the downturn in the automobile industry gathers pace.
'The company is on the verge of ruin,' commented Mr Roland Fieber, German
equities analyst at Rhine Securities in Frankfurt. 'It is facing its biggest
challenge in its post-war history.'
Other companies are facing equally severe challenges, including Volkswagen,
Europe's largest car manufacturer. The difference for investors is that VW's
shares have risen by 6 per cent since the group announced a collapse in
group earnings in the middle of last month, whilst Daimler's shares, down
nearly 10 per cent over a similar period, are still reeling from bad
earnings news and the initial effects of the Mercedes merger.
VW's appointment of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, snatched from
arch-rival General Motors, has helped to persuade investors that chief
executive Mr Ferdinand Piech is deadly serious about cutting costs, the only
way to restore the group to prosperity.
At VW, investors are taking a lot on trust - an observation which holds true
for the market as a whole. Even after its recent correction, the DAX index
has climbed by 16.6 per cent since last autumn, from a low of 1,420.30 on
October 6, through a peak of more than 1,717.30 last month, to 1,655.73 last
Thursday. It has achieved this with little support from corporate
fundamentals.
Interest rates have indeed fallen steeply over this period, but any impact
that this may have on the corporate sector is likely to be long delayed: at
present all indications are that the recession is likely to be deeper and to
last longer than expected. UBS in Frankfurt predicts that earnings at the
industrial companies within the DAX 30 index will fall by 17 per cent this
year after a drop of 16 per cent this year. At current levels the market is
on a prospective multiple of around 20 times current year earnings.
This compares with a long-term market multiple of around 11 per cent and a
five-year average of 15 per cent. Assuming earnings rebound next year by a
quarter, the market is still on 16 times earnings.
'There is a danger that all the stimuli expected for 1993 as a whole have
been played out in the first quarter,' cautions Mr Sy Schluter at CSFB in
Frankfurt. 'It has become entirely a stock-picking market.'

FT  13 APR 93 / The Week Ahead: Close watch on hotel sector after Queens
Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
WITH the financial crisis at Queens Moat Houses still not fully explained,
the rest of the hotel sector is being closely watched. Forte reports full
year results on Thursday, with the City expecting pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 73m last time.
Some expect the group to cut its 9.91p a share dividend. If it does, any
criticism is likely to be muted, with many regarding a cut as evidence of
financial sobriety.
News of current trading will focus on whether recovery is taking root in
London and any signs of life in the provinces. The group is also likely to
be pressed on whether it would be interested in any of Queens Moat's
Continental properties, should these become available.
Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group will bring more news on Thursday about
the building materials sector. The former, with about half the UK cement
market, is expected to report pre-tax profits for 1992 of about Pounds 85m,
down sharply from Pounds 124.2m a year earlier. There is also some question
hanging over its 10.9p a share dividend.
RMC, benefitting from its extensive German operations, is likely to report
profits down only slightly from 1991's Pounds 167.4m. But with the German
economy slowing rapidly, investors will be keen to hear about RMC's current
prospects.
Laura Ashley, the international fashion and furnishings group, is set to
report a return to the black on Thursday after three years of losses. It may
also pay a final dividend.
A revitalised performance in the UK and continued growth on the continent
should enable the group to report a Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m pre-tax profit for
the year to January, in spite of losses and upheavals in the US.
In 1991-92 the group lost Pounds 9.1m pre-tax including Pounds 11.5m of
exceptional charges, mainly for reorganisation and stock write-downs.
FR Group, the maker of in-flight refuelling equipment, is expected to report
today preliminary 1992 pre-tax profits of around Pounds 23m against Pounds
21.4m a year earlier. A small dividend increase is forecast from 1991's
6.69p.
One of the steadiest performers in the engineering sector, this would be the
sixth year in a row of profits in the Pounds 21m-Pounds 23m range. Investors
will need some reassurance, though, that its long term contracts will hold
up.

FT  13 APR 93 / Economics: US recovery prospects remain market focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in financial markets will keep a watch on this week's US data for
signs of whether recovery in the world's largest economy is slowing down.
The market's expectation is that today's US retail sales figures for March
will be weak, with many forecasters looking for only a small rise in sales
on the month.
The pessimism is partly the result of recent weak figures for sales in US
stores. The recent net drop in the US non-farm payroll figure for March has
also raised concerns that the sharp upturn in US economic activity seen in
the last quarter of 1992 did not follow through to the first quarter of this
year.
In the UK, the main figures this week will be the industrial production data
and the manufacturing output data for February, due out tomorrow.
There has been much debate in the UK press about the extent to which Britain
is enjoying an economic recovery. Analysts in financial markets expect that
the industrial production figures will show a slight rise after recording a
fall of 0.4 per cent in the month to February.
Later in the week, the focus in the UK will fall on the retail price
inflation figures for March. Analysts believe that these figures, due out on
Friday, should reinforce the favourable trend to UK inflation shown in
recent months. The latest RPI figure showed that the headline inflation rate
was at 1.8 per cent in the year to February.
Investors in France and Germany will keep a close watch on the money market
operations of both countries' central banks. The strong performance by the
French franc in recent weeks has raised expectations that the authorities in
Paris will lower their intervention rate, currently at 12 per cent. By
contrast, expectations of large cuts in the cost of Bundesbank lending to
German commercial banks have been somewhat disappointed in recent weeks.
Highlights of the week are as follows. In brackets are the median market
expectations for the numbers concerned, according to data provided by the
MMS business information company.
Today: France: March consumer prices index (up 0.2 per cent month-on-month).
Japan: February machine orders, ex-electricals and ships. Japan: March
wholesale prices index (down 2.3 per cent year on year). UK: March producer
prices index input (up 0.5 per cent month-on-month); March producer prices
output (up 0.7 per cent month on month). US: March retail sales (up 0.1 per
cent, ex-auto, down 0.5 per cent to 0.4 per cent); March Atlanta Fed Index;
April Johnson Redbook, for week ending 10th April.
Tomorrow: Canada: February New Housing Price Index; February Department
Store sales. UK: February Manufacturing output (up 0.2 per cent
month-on-month); February Industrial production (up 0.65 per cent
month-on-month); Treasury Monthly Monetary Report released. US: February
business inventories (up 0.1 per cent); Auto sales for 1st to 10th April;
Truck sales for 1st to 10th April; G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Tokyo to
discuss Russian debt.
Thursday: Finland: February Industrial production and March consumer prices
index. Japan: February Industrial production; February shipments. Spain:
March consumer prices index (up 0.4 per cent on the month). Sweden: March
consumer prices index (up 0.5 per cent on the month). US: Initial
unemployment claims for week-ending April 10; State benefits for week ending
3 April; April Philadelphia Index; M1, M2 and M3 money supply for week
ending April 5 and for the month of March.
Friday: Canada: February merchandise exports, imports and trade surplus. UK:
March retail prices index (up 0.2 per cent on the month and 1.8 per cent on
the year). US: February merchandise trade balance (down Dollars 7.4bn),
exports (up Dollars 37.5bn), imports (up Dollars 44.8bn); March industrial
production (unchanged); March capacity utilisation (79.7 per cent).
During the week: Denmark: February unemployment rate at 12.1 per cent.
Germany: February retail sales (down 6.5 per cent) and March wholesale
prices index (up 0.15 per cent on the month). Netherlands: March consumer
prices index, February producer prices index and March unemployment rate.
Norway: March consumer prices index. Spain: March unemployment rate (at 16.5
per cent).

FT  13 APR 93 / International Bonds: Barclays gives upper tier two a twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE market for perpetual subordinated debt of banks
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
known in regulatory parlance as upper tier two capital - was given its
latest twist last week with a Pounds 200m issue from Barclays Bank.
However, although the paper is reported to have gone down well with
investors, there was little sign that other banks would rush to follow suit.
Upper tier two debt remains a difficult and expensive form of regulatory
capital for banks to raise. There has been no ready market for such paper
since the market for perpetual floating rate notes collapsed in the late
1980s.
Japanese companies became big buyers of floating rate paper with step-up
coupons after that, buying more than Dollars 3bn of privately-placed paper
from mainly Scandinavian, US and Italian banks. That private market also
dried up some two years ago.
Yet, under Bank for International Settlement guidelines, banks' need for
upper tier two debt continues unabated.
Lower tier two capital - dated subordinated paper, for which there is no
lack of investors, though at a price - cannot exceed upper tier two for
regulatory purposes. The two together cannot exceed tier one capital
(effectively equity capital and retained earnings).
The US domestic market remains one source of such capital. Australia and New
Zealand Banking, for example, last month went to this market for undated
debt, with a call after five years, although no step-up on the coupon, which
would have increased the chances of the call being used.
However, while dollar-denominated assets are an important component of any
internationally-active bank's balance sheet, non-US banks need to limit
their dollar-denominated capital otherwise the all-important capital/asset
ratio becomes vulnerable to foreign exchange adjustments.
UK financial institutions have been able to tap a growing sterling market
for undated capital, due in part to the growing involvement in recent months
of retail investors looking for higher returns as interest rates have
fallen.
According to Salomon Brothers, which has been involved in more than a dozen
such issues, there have been 25 in all, including last week's from Barclays,
raising over Pounds 2bn.
Around a third of this has come in a dozen issues of permanent interest
bearing shares for building societies since June 1991, with the rest from
banks and insurance companies mainly in the form of irredeemable preference
shares.
Within the past six months, both Barclays and National Westminster have now
each raised Pounds 200m through undated issues with extra twists to hold
down their cost of capital.
NatWest's issue last November was of undated notes convertible into
preference shares - which count as tier one capital.
The yield-spread on the paper, at 235 basis points over long-dated gilts,
tightened after the launch to around 180 basis points.
However, the notes have suffered in line with the preference share market
since last month's Budget changes to advance corporation tax, and the yield
spread has moved out again to some 210 basis points.
Barclays last week offered a yield premium well below this - 140 basis
points over gilts for the first 15 years, rising to 240 basis points over
five-year gilts after that.
The bank retains a call option after 15 years.
There is little in the capital markets that is genuinely new, just endless
reworkings of tried and tested formulae, and so it was with the Barclays
capital-raising exercise. However, in a sterling debt market which has seen
few long-dated issues from well-regarded credits offering a substantial
yield pick-up over gilts, the paper met a good reception from the market.
Most seemed willing to view the debt as 15-year paper, on the assumption
that Barclays would need to deteriorate rapidly as a credit to make it want
to extend the debt's life beyond the first call.
On that basis, the yield pick-up was generally reckoned to be some 50 basis
points over what investors could have expected on dated subordinated paper
from the same issuer, or 80 basis points over Barclays senior debt.
That was widely seen as an adequate premium for the risk that the debt would
not be called.
Compared with other undated paper, though, the bonds were seen as expensive
for investors - although the Barclays name is likely to guarantee them a
place in many fixed income fund managers' portfolios.
Liquidity risk, rather than credit risk, could prove the most dangerous
aspect of this and other undated issues, as investors with experience of
perpetual floating rate notes will be well aware.
'In 15 years' time, it is quite possible that banks won't be able to do
perpetuals,' says one investment banker with experience of this market. 'If
it isn't called, then look out: it means that there isn't a market there
anymore.'
The involvement of retail investors could accentuate that risk. According to
Salomon, up to a quarter of the outstanding undated paper is held by such
investors, whose purchases have often led to a tightening of yield spreads
in the period after an issue is launched. Once retail investors become net
sellers, then that process will go into share reversal.

FT  13 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: HK tightens lending rules for
new issue applicants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government is to tighten rules on bank lending to applicants
for stock market new issues following concern over the HKDollars 240bn
(USDollars 31.2bn) over-subscription of Denway, the Chinese car manufacturer
floated on the colony's exchange in February.
The group's shares were 657 times subscribed, absorbing four times the
amount of money in circulation in Hong Kong. There are nine Chinese state
companies due to be floated in the colony this year, and public interest is
expected to be similarly voracious.
Under current arrangements clients can get 100 per cent funding for
subscription, encouraging them to apply for far more shares than they would
expect to be allocated. This cash is then immobilised for one week before
excess application money is returned.
The latest guidelines limit a bank's new issue subscription loans to 25 per
cent of its capital base, and recommend a margin requirement of 10 per cent
against the loans.
It is expected that brokerages will pass on this margin call to clients,
thereby cooling some of their speculative fervour.

FT  13 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: Investment managers are tempted by some
exotic options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE corporate treasurers are users of interest rate and currency
derivatives, fund managers are just starting to dabble in over-the-counter
equity options. However, this potentially vast market has attracted the
advances of investment bankers. They are designing increasingly complex
options, known as exotic options, to win over investment managers.
Equity fund managers, however, remain reluctant to use derivatives, except
for the purpose of asset allocation. One of their main objections is cost.
Specially designed equity options remain expensive, partly because they are
still part of a small and immature market and are difficult to hedge. To
counter these objections, some investment banks are offering options which,
if not cheaper, do not require such heavy upfront premiums.
The concept of knock-in and knock-out options, developed in the currency
derivatives market, has been applied in the equities market. A fund manager
buys a knock-out option if he wants to take a view that the market is going
up, but is prepared to lose the option if the market falls below a certain
level. Because the option is destroyed if the index falls below that level,
the option costs less.
A knock-in option works in a similar way. If the investor has bought a call
at, say, 3,000 on the FT-SE 100 index, the option does not knock in - that
is, cannot be exercised - until the index reaches, say, 3,500.
Another structure being offered to investors is the contingent or trigger
option, where the option is triggered by something other than the underlying
asset of the option.
A contingent option may offer a call on the market at 2,000, but it is only
valid if interest rates are below 7 per cent. The writer of such an option -
that is, the investment bank - has to assume a correlation between, in this
case, interest rates and stock prices. While this correlation does exist, it
is much more difficult to hedge such exposure.
Investors have been offered so-called correlation or performance options,
which give the best-performing of two assets or asset-classes. For example,
an investor who is not sure whether to buy Glaxo or Wellcome could buy a
correlation option which would give the stronger of the two shares.
The concept can be applied to sectors. For example, the better performer of
the pharmaceuticals or construction sectors, or indices, or different asset
classes.
Such performance options have been used mainly for expressing broader
investment views, as a form of asset allocation.
Although UK fund managers are still reluctant to use some of these more
complex products, the growing sophistication of OTC equity products is being
reflected in the more complex products, using embedded derivatives, now
available to UK retail investors. For example, some recent guaranteed return
bonds offered to UK retail investors have incorporated lock-in or ladder
options.
A recent Save &amp; Proser Guaranteed Equity bond, which offered the bulk of the
rise of the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, or return of the original
capital, allowed investors to choose between 98 per cent of the rise of the
index, or 90 per cent of the rise, with lock-in facilities when the market
rises 20 per cent and 40 per cent. A guaranteed product from Northern Rock
offered the rise in the FT-SE over five years, or 15 per cent gross, with a
50 per cent index rise locked in.
Typically, the hedging of the embedded derivatives is done by an investment
bank, rather than the building society or insurance company which markets
the retail product. Most investment banks continue to invest heavily in
equity derivatives business, keen to win a share of the lucrative market
which they expect to develop in the course of the decade.
'The majority of business being done in the equity derivatives market is
still plain-vanilla options, to suit a particular client's needs,' said one
head of derivatives at an investment bank. 'But that business is growing
quite slowly.'
Fund managers remain reluctant to become more active in equity derivatives,
partly because they are cynical about the benefits in relation to the costs,
and partly because they may be nervous of using more complex instruments.

FT  13 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bonds rally
</HEADLINE>

Bond prices continued to rally yesterday on hopes of low inflation, with the
benchmark 30-year government issue jumping almost another full point to 104
7/32 , pushing the yield down to 6.79 per cent. Investors rushed to buy
bonds in response to the announcement on Friday, when markets were closed,
that consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent in March

FT  13 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Fixed-income investors pleased by
producer prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when it looked as if the US bond market rally had run out of steam,
recently-retreating Treasury prices have turned smartly on their heels and
are heading back upwards.
It was bad inflation news which sparked the March sell-off that pushed bond
yields up through 7 per cent so it was no surprise that it was good
inflation news which prompted the market's unexpected recovery, and helped
bring bond yields down to 6.85 per cent - their lowest in several weeks.
The good news came in the form of the producer prices index, which rose 0.4
per cent in March. That figure might have unsettled the market, but for the
bulk of the rise being a temporary blip in energy prices. What pleased
fixed-income investors was the news that core producer price inflation (PPI)
 -the index minus its volatile food and energy components - rose by only 0.1
per cent last month.
The PPI numbers pushed the 30-year bond up by more than a full point, and
immediately raised hopes that the March consumer prices index (CPI) would be
equally positive. The CPI figures proved equally bullish for the market,
showing a modest 0.1 per cent increase for the month.
Both sets of data came as welcome news after a difficult March, in which
inflation jitters had pushed yields higher and threatened to end the bond
market rally that had dated back to before President Clinton's inauguration.
Yet a brighter inflation outlook is not the only buttress providing support
for bond prices. There are other factors.
Treasury investors were delighted by the success of Senate Republicans to
force President Clinton to compromise on his economic stimulus package.
Although lacking the votes to defeat the measures, the Republicans mounted
highly effective filibusters to delay the bill.
The bond market hopes that pressure from fiscally conservative Congressional
opponents will force the White House into scaling down the size of its
stimulus package. Such an outcome could limit the inflationary consequences
the package might have - if and when it passes through the legislature and
finally begins to impact upon the economy.
There has been a technical dimension to the rebound. Last week, reports from
two respected bond authorities, Goldman Sachs and Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates, addressed the issue of whether the Treasury was planning to
change the way the government borrows money.
The Goldman report said the Treasury would probably halve the number of
30-year bond issues a year from four to two, and make up the difference by
issuing more bills.
The McCarthy report went further, and said that a Treasury study had
recommended a 50 per cent reduction in the long bond, the elimination of the
seven-year note altogether, and a 20 per cent cut in the size of the monthly
five-year note issue. The reductions would be offset by increased issues of
bills.
Of the two reports, only McCarthy's claimed to be based on inside sources,
but even so, both moved the market, lifting bond prices in anticipation of
some cut in future supply. Yet, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary,
has consistently denied that there were plans to make changes to the
borrowing mix, and no announcement of any move is likely until May at the
earliest.

FT  13 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Indications of upturn reignite inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the run of indications that the UK economy may be picking up, gilt
specialists are highlighting May 18 as a day of possible fireworks.
The publication of the Bank of England's next quarterly report on inflation
is expected to reopen the discussion as to how much extra upward pressure on
prices may be expected over the next year.
Also of interest will be any behind-the-scenes disagreements between the
Bank and the Treasury as how best to describe the likely paths for
inflation.
In recent weeks gilt yields have dropped on the lack of any indications that
a rise in inflation is around the corner. The trend continued last week,
with buying pressure for the bonds helped partly by news of a four basis
point cut in Bundesbank repo rates to 8.13 per cent.
Last week produced more evidence that UK consumers may be increasing their
demand for credit after the low level of borrowing last year.
The increase in borrowing through finance houses, building societies and
certain bank credit cards in the three months to the end of February
totalled a seasonally adjusted Pounds 305m, well above the Pounds 64m in the
previous three months.
The announcement that new car sales rose in March by a year-on-year 12.7 per
cent, and that house prices rose 1.2 per cent last month to show their
biggest monthly increase for four years, added to the expectations that
growth may be returning to the UK.
For the time being, such indications are being welcomed in the gilt market
on the grounds that a return to growth after the recession which started
nearly three years ago will constrain any further rises in the fiscal
deficit which is expected to be around Pounds 50bn this financial year.
However, clear signs of an upturn will also reignite worries about
inflation.
Many gilt specialists believe that underlying inflation over the next 12
months will breach the government's 4 per cent upper limit. This measure of
inflation - the year-on-year changes in the retail prices index, less
mortgage costs - was 3.4 per cent in the year to February.
The figure for the year to March is being announced on Friday, while the
latest numbers for the price changes of manufactured goods at the wholesale
level - another good indicator of inflationary pressures - are coming out
today.
In its first inflation report in February, the Bank set a possibly fateful
precedent by publishing an explicit forecast of underlying inflation.
While the Bank made clear there was a large possible margin of error, its
central forecast for inflation at the end of 1994 is a year-on-year 3.5 per
cent.
The Bank hedged its bets by saying the range could be between 1 per cent and
6 per cent. The last published Treasury projection, made in the March
Budget, is that underlying inflation would be 3.75 per cent in the second
quarter of 1994.
In the past, the Bank has refused to publish any of its internal forecasts.
That has been mainly on the grounds that publication of Bank forecasts might
open divisions with the Treasury - which has often been sensitive to the
Bank coming out with views on the economy which differ from its own.
Even though the details of Bank forecasts have been hidden from outsiders,
the Bank has periodically patted itself on the back by saying its
projections in recent years have been a lot more accurate than rivals both
inside and outside the government.
The Bank has now decided - at least for inflation - to put its forecasting
reputation on the line.
In the light of the apparent stirrings of economic activity, Bank economists
are considering the range of possibilities which could lead to inflation
overshooting the 4 per cent limit.
If the Bank does feel impelled to publish next month a forecast of inflation
above this level, there is a high possibility of a fracas with the Treasury.
However, the Bank's game plan cannot be faulted. It seems determined to
bring out into the open any disagreements about inflation possibilities
between its own officials and the Treasury.
In this way, a more sensible and informed discussion may take place as how
best to keep price pressures low in the longer term and so improve on the
UK's dismal inflation performance in recent years.

FT  13 APR 93 / European Government Bonds: Spanish poll may renew ERM
tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO events have helped to ease tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism recently - the gradual lowering of German interest rates, and the
centre-right election victory in France.
However, yesterday's news of an early general election in Spain could lead
to another bout of speculation against the peseta and renewed tension within
the ERM.
The European government bond markets expect the Bundesbank to continue
easing, albeit in rather small steps in the near term, and as German
interest rates fall this should pave the way for other European central
banks.
Although there was some disappointment that the Bundesbank cut only its
discount rate - to 7.5 per cent - on March 18, and not its Lombard rate as
well, the bund market has since witnessed a very gradual easing in
short-term interest rates.
The rate at the Bundesbank's repo tender was lowered from 8.25 per cent to
8.17 per cent at the beginning of April, and by a further 4 basis points to
8.13 per cent last week.
While the bund market would much prefer to see bigger and bolder cuts in
interest rates, statements from the Bundesbank suggest that the market may
have to remain content with a 'slowly, slowly' approach for the time being
at least.
The other piece of good news for the European bonds markets was the French
election result. The landslide victory for the centre-right parties in the
elections and the subsequent appointment of Mr Edouard Balladur as prime
minister has provided considerable support for the franc. Already,
short-term interest rates have started to decline, and further falls are
expected possibly as early as this week.
While the background for the European bond markets looks good, economists
point out that there are a couple of hurdles which must be overcome in the
short term.
One danger is the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty which takes
place on May 18 and which, given the Danish rejection last June, will
provide an important focus for the European markets in the next few weeks.
'Although the opinion polls are currently suggesting that a comfortable
majority will vote in favour of monetary union, there is likely to be a
degree of nervousness ahead of the vote given the surprise outcome of last
June's referendum,' says Mr Nigel Rendell, bond analyst at James Capel.
The other 'trouble-spot' as far as the bond markets are concerned is Spain.
Last week, the Spanish bond market focused on threats by Prime Minister
Gonzalez to resign as leader of the Socialist Party over an alleged funding
scandal.
Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global Markets Research, pointed out
last week that in the event of an election being called in June, 'the peseta
would probably not be able to survive in the interim without devaluing. The
whole ERM could come under new strains with the Portuguese escudo sure to
follow the peseta down.'
However, taking the most optimistic scenario - in which Denmark votes in
favour of monetary union, and the peseta remains within the ERM - bond
analysts expect the main talking point in the European markets to be
interest rate convergence.
Mr Rendell points out that 'the depth and duration of the current recession
is likely to lead to further declines in inflation and substantial cuts in
short-term interest rates. This should more than offset the potential
negative impact of extra bond issuance as a result of deteriorating budget
deficits throughout Europe'.
Yields on French government bonds have already narrowed considerably
compared with those on German bonds. The 10-year yield spread has fallen
from above 100 basis points to 60 basis points recently, and could fall to
as low as 30 basis points by next spring.

INTEL yesterday consolidated its position as the world's leading computer
chip maker with exceptionally strong first-quarter earnings and revenues on
the back of brisk sales of PCs using its microprocessors.
The unexpectedly robust results, and a bullish forecast for the second
quarter, lifted shares across the semiconductor manufacturing sector. Intel
firmed Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 117 1/2 , Motorola climbed Dollars
2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 3/8 and Advanced Micro Devices hit a
year-high of Dollars 25 3/4 , up Dollars  3/4 .
For the three months to March 27, Intel posted net profits of Dollars
547.9m, or Dollars 2.48 a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.02bn. This
compares with earnings of Dollars 184.1m, or 86 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 1.24bn a year earlier.
Wall Street had expected Intel to report earnings of about Dollars 2.13 a
share, and few analysts had expected per-share earnings to exceed Dollars
2.40.
Mr Andrew Grove, chief executive, said: 'It took us 22 years to get to the
Dollars 1bn a quarter in revenues and, thanks to the explosion in demand for
the Intel 486 chip, less than three years to get to Dollars 2bn a quarter.'
Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips which form the brains
of more than 70 per cent of the world's PCs.
The company recently unveiled plans to add a Dollars 1bn expansion to its
New Mexico plant.
MOTOROLA, the US electronics manufacturer, also exceeded expectations by
posting 63 per cent improvement in underlying first quarter earnings to
Dollars 204m, or 75 cents a share, on sales which rose 19 per cent to
Dollars 3.63bn.
Wall Street had expected earnings of 64 cents a share. A year earlier,
Motorola reported underlying earnings of Dollars 125m, or 47 cents, on sales
of Dollars 3.05bn. A change in accounting standards reduced last year's net
income to Dollars 2m, or 1 cent a share.

The money will be used to reduce debt, lift working capital and provide
funds for general corporate purposes.
The plans were revealed last week when Dean Witter filed for a shelf
offering of up to Dollars 3bn in debt securities with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. A shelf registration allows a company to issue up to
the certified amount of securities over a two-year period.
Dean Witter shares, which were floated at Dollars 27, are trading at Dollars

FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Pilatus to buy Piper Aircraft
assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIPER Aircraft Corporation, one of the few remaining manufacturers of small
aircraft in the US, has agreed to sell most of its assets to Switzerland's
Pilatus Aircraft.
Pilatus, which makes single-engine, turbo-prop training aircraft as well as
utility and commuter aircraft, would pay Dollars 20m in cash, provide a
Dollars 10m note, and assume Dollars 6m of obligations.
However, the tentative deal with Pilatus, a subsidiary of the Zurich based
Oerlikon-Buhrle weapons and engineering group, could open the door to
competing offers.
Piper - with headquarters in Vero Beach, Florida - has been operating under
bankruptcy court protection since July 1991, and US bankruptcy procedure
usually allows any asset sale proposal to be successfully topped by a
'higher and better offer'.
Yesterday, lawyers for Piper said there had been no formal position taken on
the Pilatus offer by Piper's unsecured creditors, but they had generally
encouraged management to get a sale process under way.
'We owe it to our creditors, employees, distributors and suppliers to
resolve the bankruptcy at the earliest possible date with the greatest
pay-out to the creditors,' said Mr Charles Suma, the chief operating officer
at Piper.
Like other small aircraft manufacturers, Piper has been bedevilled for years
by product liability suits - which have led to heavy legal costs and onerous
insurance premiums.
Critically, the agreement with Pilatus envisages that the Swiss company
would acquire the Piper assets 'free and clear' of these claims.
Part of the Pilatus consideration would then be set aside in a trust to deal
with such product liability actions, where successful.
The latest events at Piper follow an active decade for the company. Founded
in 1929, Piper was a family-run business for many years. However, by the
1980s ownership had passed to Lear Siegler, the US private company.
In 1987, Mr Stuart Millar, a US businessman who had been a Second World War
fighter pilot, bought the company. In early-1991, there were attempts to
sell the business - by then cash-strapped - to Aerospatiale but the French
aerospace group withdrew, largely because of the product liability problems.
In 1991, when Piper went into bankruptcy, it had effectively ceased
operations. Today, however, it employs about 350 people, and last year
delivered 85 piston-engined aircraft. Sales over the past 12 months were
about Dollars 47m.

FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Sulzer jumps to SFr168m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has unveiled a 56 per cent jump in net
profits to SFr168m (Dollars 112m) for 1992, more than making up for the 23
per cent fall in 1991.
The directors are proposing that the dividend, which was cut to SFr13 per
share last year, from SFr15, be raised to SFr16. Consolidated sales rose 5
per cent to SFr6.8bn. The group said the profit increase was due mainly to a
sharp improvement in operating income to SFr250m from a restated SFr163m.
It said 1992 accounts were prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards and last year's figures have been adjusted.

FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: IRI seeks to raise up to
L1,200bn from SME

IRI, the Italian state holding company, is expected to raise between
L1,000bn and L1,200bn (Dollars 631m-Dollars 757m) by selling the industrial
activities of its listed SME foods subsidiary.
SME's food production activities are concentrated in Italgel (frozen foods)
and Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (canned foods and edible oils). Preliminary
offers for the two businesses, put on sale in March, are due next week,
after which final offers will be selected from a short list. The buyers may
be known by the end of May.
About 30 companies have expressed interest in the two businesses, including
multinationals, domestic food groups and some financial interests. In spite
of criticism of some conditions attached to the sales, a senior IRI
executive stressed all the terms were negotiable apart from the need to
maintain jobs and not alter workers' contracts.
IRI executives say the disposals will go ahead on schedule, in spite of the
lengthy occupation of SME's Naples headquarters by a small group of
dissident workers.
The sit-in has prevented access to the building, which houses computer
information needed to draw up the group's 1992 results.
'The general climate in Naples is extremely delicate at present,' said an
SME executive.
'It is not yet critical for us to remove them, and we do not want to create
unnecessary tensions in the city.'
Over the weekend it was revealed that secret negotiations had taken place
between workers and management. However, the outcome is not yet clear.
IRI has accelerated plans to sell other parts of SME, which also operates in
food retailing and catering. Next month, it will sound out potential
investors to take minority stakes in the two businesses, which will be kept
together as one unit.

FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Harlequin sells novel romance to
TV group

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOAP operas, move over. Mills &amp; Boon and Harlequin romances are coming to
television.
Harlequin Enterprises of Toronto, the romance-fiction publisher, has sold
the international TV and video rights to its 16,000 titles to Alliance
Communications, one of Canada's largest film and television production and
distribution houses.
Alliance will initially adapt a package of six Harlequin titles for
television at a cost of CDollars 18m (USDollars 14.2m). They will be
available by summer 1994. The plan is eventually to offer licensees a
package of 26 films.
CBS, the US television network, has bought broadcast rights in the US, and
has made an undisclosed financial contribution towards the screenplay
adaptations. Alliance officials will be at an international TV convention in
Cannes next week in the hope of signing up broadcasters in other parts of
the world.
Harlequin will market the films in home-video form through the extensive
direct-mail network it uses to sell many of its books.
Several earlier attempts to adapt Harlequin books to the screen have
foundered. But Mr Robert Lantos, Alliance chairman, said that the latest
venture targeted 'a huge untapped audience with an unbeatable brand-name
product'.
Harlequin sells more than 200m books a year in 26 languages, with 62 new
titles appearing each month. Its fastest growing markets include Japan -
where 14m books were sold last year - and parts of eastern Europe.
The company is owned by Torstar, which publishes the Toronto Star, Canada's
biggest daily newspaper. Torstar's book division, consisting mainly of
Harlequin, posted record profits of CDollars 61.8m in 1992 on sales of
CDollars 418m.

Net profits for the three months fell by 50 per cent to Dollars 27.6m, or 31
cents a share, down from Dollars 55.1m, or 64 cents, a year earlier.
Sales fell 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn from Dollars 2.3bn.
The net figure included Dollars 4.8m, or 6 cents a share, in foreign
exchange profits following the devaluation of the Surinam guilder. The
comparable figure included profits of Dollars 8m, or 10 cents a share, on
the sale of investments in Venezuela.

ALPS Electric, a leading Japanese electronics parts manufacturer, expects to
reveal consolidated net losses for the first time when it reports its
results for the year to March 1993.
Alps, which makes electronic parts for consumer electronics, data
communications and other electronic equipment, forecasts net losses of
Y2.3bn (Dollars 20.2m), compared with a forecast made in November of profits
of Y1.5bn.
The lower result will stem mainly from extraordinary losses at a subsidiary,
Tohoku Alps, where it was necessary to liquidate inventory.
In the year to March 1992, Alps reported consolidated net profits of Y7.3bn.
The group is selling securities holdings in other companies to improve
taxable profits which are forecast at Y5.6bn, compared with a previous
forecast of Y4.5bn. In the year to March 1992, consolidated pre-tax profits
were Y15.8bn.
Consolidated sales are forecast at Y420bn, compared with a previous forecast
of Y430bn and 1992 sales of Y461bn.

FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Marlboro move leaves BAT gasping for breath
 -The US cigarette price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Philip Morris to raise the stakes in the US cigarette price
war by cutting the price of Marlboro, its leading brand, has wreaked costly
damage to the shares of BAT Industries.
Investors' concerns about the possible impact on BAT's US tobacco profits -
about Pounds 380m of a worldwide total of Pounds 1.34bn last year - have
sent the share price of the UK-based multinational tumbling from 999p to
887p, wiping some Pounds 1.66bn off its market capitalisation.
Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, professes to be more perplexed than
worried by Philip Morris's tactics.
'We find it difficult to see what it hopes to achieve,' he says.
He compares Philip Morris's move to that of 'a poker player holding a full
house who calls a misdeal in the hope of getting a better hand.'
BAT, he says, will wait to see what happens in the market before playing its
own cards.
'We may be one of those who started the price war, but we have no wish to
escalate it,' he adds. 'But we shall be ready to respond tactically where
necessary.'
Brown &amp; Williamson, its US subsidiary, claims 20 per cent of the discount
sector which has been eating into Marlboro's market share.
Almost non-existent 10 years ago, discount cigarettes now account for 36 per
cent of the total market.
Brown &amp; Williamson's GPC Approved is the fastest-growing brand in the
sector.
From an overall market share of 1.2 per cent in 1990 it has risen to become
the seventh best-selling cigarette in the US with 4.2 per cent of the
market.
Even if the price of a pack of Marlboro is cut by the expected 40 cents, it
would still cost 50 cents a pack more than GPC Approved, says Mr Broughton.
That narrowing of the price differential might temporarily stem the decline
in Marlboro's market share, Mr Broughton concedes - but it would carry
substantial risks.
'Philip Morris does not intend to reposition the Marlboro brand at a
permanently lower price level.
'All the evidence - including our own experience and Philip Morris's test
marketing in Portland - suggests that though discounts will raise a brand's
sales, they fall back when the price is increased again, and usually end up
lower than they were in the first place.'
Nor could it be in Philip Morris's interest to extend the discount sector,
in which its 12 own-label and other brands already vie for market leadership
with RJ Reynolds's 19 products.
'To do so would threaten sales of the group's much more profitable
full-priced brands such as Benson &amp; Hedges and Merit,' Mr Broughton argues.
BAT's main full price brands - Kool menthol and Capri superslims - occupied
market niches which, though highly competitive, had proved resistant to
discounting, he says.

FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: PNG to take 30% stake in RTZ gold joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAPUA NEW Guinea has confirmed it plans to take a 30 per cent stake in the
the Lihir Island gold project being developed by RTZ Corporation of the UK
and PNG-based Niugini Mining.
The government had earlier planned to take a 20 per cent stake in the
project, which is expected to develop into one of the world's biggest and
lowest cost gold mines.
However, Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the cabinet had decided
to increase its proposed stake to equal its holding in the Porgera project,
the biggest gold mine outside South Africa.
'This shows all the mining community here in PNG that we like to maintain a
standard policy . . . and get a fair share for our people,' Mr Iangalio
said.
The announcement was welcomed by Niugini, a 55 per cent-owned subsidiary of
Battle Mountain Gold, the US resources group, which owns 20 per cent of the
Lihir project.
'We have always encouraged the PNG government to take a full part in the
project, and we are very happy with the level of equity they plan to take,'
said Mr Gavin Thomas, director of exploration.
The government is expected to pay Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 24.8m), equivalent
to 30 per cent of the project's sunk costs, for its stake. The deal will
reduce Niugini's shareholding to 14 per cent, and RTZ's from 80 per cent to
56 per cent.
Mr Iangalio said the government hoped to grant a special mining lease in
October or November, enabling construction and tunnelling work to start.
Niugini estimates that mining would probably begin between 27 and 33 months
later.
The Lihir mine, which has proven and possible reserves of 42.2m troy ounces
of gold, is expected to produce 620,000 ounces a year for the first few
years, rising to 1.3m ounces a year later in its 30-year life.
Total costs of Dollars 248.75 an ounce, including Dollars 163.20 cash
operating costs, will make it one of the world's lowest cost gold mines.
Mr Iangalio said the government's decision to take 'positive steps' to
secure a significant stake in Lihir was prompted partly by a recent dispute
with the overseas owners of the Porgera mine.
The dispute ended last month when the government agreed to pay K138.75m
(Pounds 91.8m) to increase its stake from 10 per cent to 25 per cent - less
than the 30 per cent it had sought.
The deal reduced the equity of the three Australian-controlled joint venture
partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a
subsidiary of MIM Holdings - from 30 per cent each to 25 per cent each.
The Australian groups initially refused to reduce their equity in Porgera
when Mr Paias Wingti's newly-elected government announced last year that it
wanted to increase its stake to 30 per cent.
'With the experience we went through with equity participation in Porgera we
are taking positive steps now to address that participation (in Lihir),' Mr
Iangalio said.

distributor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VINTEN, the Suffolk-based camera mountings and systems, surveillance and
electro-optics company, is buying Bogen Photo Corporation, its
long-established American distributor, from Victor Hasselblad, an affiliate
of Incentive, the Swedish industrial group.
A maximum cash consideration of Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.6m) is agreed, but
will be reduced if Bogen's net assets at completion are less than Dollars
10m.
Bogen currently sells 30 per cent of the photographic equipment manufactured
by Gruppo Manfrotto, which was acquired by Vinten in 1989.
Existing management will continue to operate the company which showed a
profit before tax of Dollars 3.4m for 1992.
Gearing - 27 per cent at the year end - will increase after the acquisition.
Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said this was not worrying as interest
was covered 10.5 times last year.
'This vertical integration secures our distribution in the US, our largest
export market,' explained Mr Baggott, adding that the group was already
self-distributed in Italy and France.

FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Consultants take helm at Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT HOUSES has appointed two senior consultants to help run the
embattled hotel group. They will take over the main duties of the deputy
chairman and finance director, both of whom were suspended two weeks ago as
part of the inquiry into the group's finances.
The appointments, made at the behest of the group's bankers, will reinforce
calls from Queens Moat's creditors and shareholders for a new management
team to be appointed before trading resumes in the company's shares. The
listing was suspended on March 31.
The two consultants, whose names are not yet being revealed, will strengthen
the investigating team, which is headed by accountants Grant Thornton and
was sent in by bank lenders to ascertain the state of the company's
finances. They will make a preliminary report within the next few weeks.
A deterioration in Queens Moat's fortunes is believed to have reduced an
expected Pounds 80m profit for 1992 to losses of up to Pounds 80m.
The consultants, specialists in rescuing companies in difficulty, will not
sit on the board but will fill the gap while a new chief executive is
sought.
The suspension of Mr Martin Marcus, the deputy chairman, and Mr David
Hersey, the finance director, came two days after the shares were suspended
on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr Marcus sold half his shares to fulfil personal obligations on the day
prior to its closed period. An inquiry into Queens Moat's share dealings has
recently been completed by the London Stock Exchange, but no decision has
yet been taken on further action.
Meanwhile, reports over the weekend of a row between UK and German banks
over the holding of Queens Moat deposits were being played down by both the
company and leading UK banks.

ALMOST A quarter of Britain's leading institutional investors are planning
to increase their holdings of Japanese equities according to a Gallup survey
for Smith New Court, the securities house, which is published today.
The latest survey of 90 institutions handling Pounds 594bn of funds carried
out earlier this month shows a marked shift in fund managers' preferences
for overseas equities.
The percentage of fund managers planning to increase their Japanese equities
exposure has risen from 5 per cent in March to 23 per cent this month, the
highest level since June last year.
However, institutions are becoming less positive about investment
opportunities in continental Europe and the UK, and there is a growing
intention to sell US equities.
Only 9 per cent of the survey respondents plan to increase their holdings of
UK equities compared with 18 per cent last month, but fund managers appear
to be more optimistic about the longer term outlook for UK equities than any
other main market.
A balance of 78 per cent of respondents are bullish about UK equities over
the next 12 months compared with the 58 per cent who are bullish about
Japanese equities, 53 per cent optimistic about continental Europe and 27
per cent who are positive towards US equities over the same period.
There have also been further upward revisions in the April survey to
forecasts for earnings per share growth in the UK, from 12 per cent to 14
per cent for 1993 and from 14 per cent to 14.5 per cent for 1994.
Forecasts for dividend per share growth remain 4 per cent and 6 per cent
respectively.
Optimism is still growing about prospects for the UK economy.
In April, 26 per cent of managers thought the general economic situation
would markedly improve in the coming year, compared with only 10 per cent in
December.

FT  13 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: Darker mood casts a cloud over Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Austria provides a fresh and depressing case study of how hard times can
breed unpleasant politics.
For most of last year, the Austrian economy was the envy of Europe, defying
the entrenched or deepening recessionary tendencies elsewhere. As late as
September, economists were still predicting GDP growth of 2.5 per cent for
the year, and Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian central bank,
was assuring visitors that the country would not even have to face a soft
landing in 1993.
Against this buoyant background, most Austrians displayed an admirable
tolerance for the flood of immigrants and cheap goods pouring in from
eastern Europe.
While ugly anti-immigrant riots were breaking out in neighbouring Germany,
Austria was quietly absorbing well over 100,000 new arrivals, some 60,000
refugees from Bosnia alone.
There were problems, of course. Petty crime rates went up and some Vienna
neighbourhoods became unacceptably overcrowded with immigrants, leading to
demands from Viennese parents that quotas be set on non-German speaking
children in their primary schools.
And some industrialists, notably those in textiles, cement and fertilisers,
complained of unfair competition from low-cost eastern European producers
and demanded protection. Austrians were at an unfair disadvantage, they
claimed, because they had to invest heavily in environmental protection
systems and pay full market prices for energy whereas eastern Europeans did
not.
But Austrian political and business leaders, magnanimous in their
prosperity, were confident that the social problems could be solved and
seemed ready to accept that some basic industries would have to be ceded
gradually to lower-cost producers in the east.
After all, one of the reasons the economy was doing so well was because of
bubbling exports to eastern Europe. Moreover, the country's leaders were
optimistic that renewed ties with eastern Europe would bring new vitality to
the economy in the medium term.
'It is hard for us to do anything to help these hurt sectors because we are
doing so well overall,' Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy director of the
powerful federal Chamber of Commerce, said in September.
But in the past few months, the country has plunged suddenly into economic
stagnation. Its future economic growth may come from cultivating links with
eastern Europe, but at present it is still heavily dependent on Germany.
Nearly 40 per cent of Austria's total exports go to its giant neighbour, so
it was inevitable that the slumping demand in Germany would spill over.
It hit particularly hard in the fourth quarter. Austrian manufacturers'
export orders dried up and industrial output tumbled. In December alone,
industrial production dropped 8 per cent.
GDP growth last year was up only 1.5 per cent and economists have repeatedly
revised down their forecasts for the current year. The latest estimates from
the authoritative Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), published
a few days ago, call for zero growth, the worst performance since 1981.
Private sector economists fear it could be worse still, especially if the
German economy continues to weaken.
The amount of money owed by failed Austrian companies doubled in the first
quarter to Sch8.8bn (Pounds 510m), and business leaders have been warning of
some big headline cases still to come. Unemployment is rising towards 7 per
cent, a level not seen since the 1950s.
In this suddenly darker climate, tolerance has equally suddenly given way to
a narrower view of self interest. In January, Mr Jorg Haider, the populist
leader of the right-wing Freedom Party, launched an inflammatory petition
campaign aimed at curbing immigration and immigrants' rights.
The petition itself was a flop, but only because of massive campaigning
against it by all other political parties, the churches and most of the
media. But its message was heard. Last month, Mr Franz Loschnak, the
interior minister, announced that Austria would not accept any more refugees
from Bosnia.
Also last month, quotas were introduced on cement imports from eastern
Europe. Last week saw the beginning of restrictions on fertiliser imports.
Industrialists in several other sectors are clamouring for protection and
they are now likely to be heard.
They have a new and unexpected champion in the person of Mr Franz Vranitzky,
the normally unflappable and business-like chancellor. Last autumn Mr
Vranitzky shrugged off the pressure on some Austrian industries from eastern
Europe as an inevitable micro-economic cost in a macro-economic success
story.
But today, with the economy in trouble and an election only a year away, he
is more strident. 'If cheap imports are threatening Austrian industries,
because the reforming countries do not have environmental standards and
because energy costs are massively subsidised - in other words there is no
fair competition - then it is legitimate to take measures to protect
domestic companies, at least temporarily,' he told a symposium on Austrian
industry last month.
It would be unjust to be too critical of these trends. Austria's responses
to its slump are not noticeably different from - and in many instances are
less severe than - those of other western European countries. Compare
Britain's niggardly response to the Bosnian refugee crisis, or the draconian
measures taken by the European Commission in recent months to keep out
low-cost imports from eastern European countries.
But the distressing thing is that they are all pointing in the same sterile
direction. 'The iron curtain is closing again, but this time we are the ones
who are closing it,' an Austrian diplomat observed glumly a few weeks ago.
At the time, the remark struck me as a gross overstatement. Now I am not so
sure.

FT  13 APR 93 / Lloyds against full Abbey Life takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK is unlikely to spend surplus capital to increase its 60 per cent
share in Lloyds Abbey Life, its insurance arm, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds'
chief executive, has indicated.
Mr Pitman said that purchasing the remaining 40 per cent at a cost of Pounds
1.1bn would have 'all sorts of negatives'. He said a full acquisition could
encourage a clash of cultures between employees.
Mr Pitman's remarks at a banking conference organised by the stockbrokers
Hoare Govett follow speculation that Lloyds might buy the rest of Lloyds
Abbey Life rather than trying to acquire a bank such as TSB or Royal Bank of
Scotland.
He said Lloyds had gained from its Abbey Life stake because it had learned
new methods of rewarding staff for achievement. However, a full acquisition
could lead to a confusion between sales and service cultures.
'It is certainly not the case that in banking, the more products you sell
the more money you make. It would be very dangerous for our managers to
believe that,' he said.
Mr Pitman said that Lloyds, which last year made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
801m and achieved a 16.9 per cent post-tax return on shareholders' equity,
was now generating cash and would continue to strengthen its capital ratios.
He said Lloyds wanted to retain strong capital rather than leverage assets
excessively. But it would be uncomfortable if its ratio of shareholders'
funds to total assets rose from the current 5 per cent to above 6 per cent.
Mr Pitman said Lloyds hoped to increase its return on shareholders' funds to
more than 18 per cent.

FT  13 APR 93 / James Capel aims to stay on a fairway: UK stockbroker's
spell in the rough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For James Capel, 1992 was going to be a banner year. Over-expansion at the
end of the 1980s had been followed by a round of cost-cutting: by the end of
last year, staff numbers were more than 1,000 below their peak. Profits were
going to reach levels not seen since the UK-based broker became part of the
Hongkong Bank group in 1986.
It was not to be. An eastern European venture capital fund, launched by
Capel in New York at the end of 1989, came back to haunt the broker in 1992.
The entire DM48m (around Pounds 16m at the time it was launched) invested in
the fund, New Europe Hotels, appears now to have been lost and Capel - which
had two directors on the fund's board - has compensated investors for their
losses. The saga ended last week with the resignations of three senior
executives, including Mr James Fergusson, managing director.
The New Europe Hotels wipe-out owes much to one large bad investment: a
DM20m stake in the Gut Altentann golf course near Salzburg, home of the
Austrian Open championship. The plan was to develop a hotel at the course.
That project was later shelved, due in part to difficulties with planning
permission - though Capel may recover part of its investment.
Other investments by the fund, created primarily to invest in
western-standard hotels in eastern Europe, are thought to have been very
small, though the fund spent millions on legal and other advice connected
with potential hotel developments, and on its own operating costs.
The UK broker, which launched the fund through its New York office, opted to
pay compensation rather than fight angry investors through the courts. Not
to do so, it feared, could have led to large legal fees and a loss of
goodwill among investment clients - Capel's greatest asset.
Mr Bernard Asher, the HSBC director who became Capel's chairman two years
ago, says the New Europe Hotels saga was the result of over-ambition.
It was 'well outside the parameters of what we were meant to be doing' in
New York. Capel's business should revolve around selling equities to its
high-quality institutional customer base, not using its distribution
strength to sponsor low-quality transactions which have been rejected by
other investment banks, he adds.
The effect on the broker's 1992 results was devastating. Operating profits,
before special charges, seemed likely to reach close to Pounds 30m - a
return of more than 20 per cent on the broker's capital of Pounds 128m. The
reported figure was cut to only Pounds 7.5m by New Europe and a series of
charges related to redundancies and the effects of the City of London bomb
which forced Capel out of its offices last March, just as the stock market
was jumping after the UK general election.
The senior management changes forced by last week's resignations are the
latest moves to give a new face to the broker's top management since Mr
Asher moved in to exercise more direct control by Hongkong Bank two years
ago.
Mr Peter Letley, another Hongkong Bank appointee and Capel's finance
director since 1988, became deputy chairman earlier this month. Mr David
Dugdale, a former deputy chairman and senior executive who had already taken
on a non-executive role, took early retirement in February. Mr Mike Geering,
director of research, left for Mercury Asset Management late last year.
Senior Capel executives say the move does not imply a change of direction,
but that after six years in the job it was time for change.
Capel prefers to point to the continuity in its senior management. This
includes the appointment last week of the 36-year-old Mr Robert Benton as
managing director. A former equity salesman who joined Capel 11 years ago,
Mr Benton comes from the traditional heart of Capel's business, as head of
UK institutional broking.
Getting Capel back into the black has taken some hefty pruning. Like others,
the broker expanded rapidly after the Big Bang reforms of 1986, driven by
its perceived need for a worldwide equity distribution network. In the year
before Mr Asher arrived, staff numbers were cut by 300, but they still stood
at 2,300. On a comparable basis - without the HSBC-owned Wardley-Thomson
brought into the group last year - they are now 1,480.
A move into France, where it acquired the stockbroker Dufour Lacarriere
Pouget, was typical of the over-expansion. Having bought a retail
stockbroker also engaged in bond trading, Capel tried to turn the business
into an institutional stockbroker with a strong derivative trading
operation. It has now been cut right back, leaving just a team handling
equity distribution. Staff in France rose from more than 200 at the start of
the decade before falling back to under 40 now.
Other overseas adventures have not involved acquisitions and have been less
painful. For example, Capel did not experience the losses in Japan that hit
some foreign brokers during the market doldrums of 1992.
The pruning has left what Mr Asher calls 'a specialised international
securities house' with a business built around research-based agency
broking. It also has limited securities trading operations, so that they
help its institutional clients to execute their business rather than trade
for the firm's own account.
This means Capel does not need large financial resources. The capital
employed in the business, now Pounds 128m, has fallen as the broker has
repaid loan capital to its parent. That in turn has brought down its
interest costs, helping to bolster profits.
Will Capel eventually be subsumed into a larger HSBC investment banking
operation, built out of the Wardley and Samuel Montagu businesses as well as
the UK broker? Mr Asher is now chairman of all three, having taken over at
the Midland-owned Montagu two weeks ago.
He says no such changes are planned: 'I have to be much more pragmatic than
that. We are not an integrated US investment house, and should not posture
as one.' He points out, for example, that Capel works closely with a number
of merchant banks in London. 'That relationship is good and strong, and I'm
not about to disturb that.' Nevertheless, Mr Asher - and Capel's senior
executives - hope that Samuel Montagu will become a source of new corporate
transactions to feed the broker's distribution arm. Getting the balance
right will be the biggest test of the coming few years.
If Capel can put experiences like New Europe Hotels behind it, it could
emerge as one of the most profitable London-based securities houses. But
given its history since the mid-1980s, that may not be something HSBC's
shareholders would bet on.

FT  13 APR 93 / Nomura urged to participate in GPA issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP'S biggest shareholder, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Corporation, is urging its financial adviser, Nomura International, to take
up part of the company's Dollars 200m (Pounds 131m) convertible preference
share issue.
Bankers to GPA recently gave the debt-ridden aircraft leasing company until
the end of this week to raise Dollars 100m from existing shareholders and
new investors, with indications of serious bids for the other Dollars 100m.
But international investors have given a less than enthusiastic response to
the fund-raising exercise which is the first stage of a broader financial
restructuring.
Mitsubishi, with 12 per cent of the equity, has indicated that it is willing
to subscribe for up to Dollars 50m of the new shares on condition that
Nomura does the same.
Nomura, which co-ordinated GPA's ill-fated attempt for a public listing last
summer, has so far refused Mitsubishi's request. It already holds 1.75m GPA
shares, most of which it bought at an average of Dollars 20 a share compared
with the Dollars 1 conversion price of the convertible. According to one of
the group's bankers, GPA has identified other shareholders and potential new
investors which may be willing to subscribe.
These include existing shareholders such as the Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan and a big US state pension fund. However, so far only the Irish
government has commited itself to taking part in GPA's share issue.
The Shannon Development Authority, a regional development agency in the west
of Ireland where GPA is based, is willing to take up the rights of Aer
Lingus, another big shareholder.
GPA's other big shareholders, Irish Life and Air Canada, have not committed
themselves.
Mr Tony Ryan, the group's founder and chairman who has an 8 per cent stake,
has told bankers he is unlikely to take up his rights.
Some shareholders are concerned that the group has been unable to raise
Dollars 752m from the sale of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases, called
ALPS 2. The group originally hoped that the issue would be completed by the
end of March.

FT  13 APR 93 / Spanish bank goes ahead with share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish bank, is to go ahead with its
international share offering in spite of the uncertainty created by
yesterday's snap election announcement. The bank announced a price range of
Pta3,500 to Pta3,950 a share for the sale, valuing the 22.31 per cent stake
on offer at Pta98bn to Pta110bn (Pounds 625m).
Analysts described the range as reasonable, saying the final price would be
close to or even below the group's book value of Pta3,863 a share. The final
offer price will be set on or around April 23 and the subscription period
will start at the end of the following week.
'In an electoral period it is likely that Argentaria will be seeking to
offer as attractive a price as possible,' said Mr Juan Cueto of
Ibersecurities, a Madrid stockbroking firm.
Argentaria will offer 28m shares or approximately 22.31 per cent of its
equity. The offer may be increased to 31.3m shares, or 24.9 per cent, if
justified by demand.
More than half of the offering will be aimed at retail investors in Spain.
Four million shares, in the form of 8m American depositary receipts will
make up the US tranche with Morgan Stanley acting as lead manager.
The UK tranche comprises provisionally 3.5m shares, with SG Warburg as lead
manager. The continental European tranche, lead by Union Bank of
Switzerland, will account for 2.5m shares. A further 1m shares will be
offered outside these areas.

FT  13 APR 93 / Prison officers back Strangeways bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRISON OFFICERS at Strangeways, Manchester, have agreed to limit their right
to take industrial action in an attempt to keep the management of the prison
in the public sector.
Rival bids from the public and private sectors to run the rebuilt
Strangeways, severely damaged in riots three years ago, will be submitted to
the Home Office today.
The public sector bid will contain a procedural agreement between the Prison
Officers Association (POA) at Strangeways and the present prison management.
It guarantees that if the bid succeeds, standards set out in the management
contract with the government would be maintained during industrial action.
This would rule out all-out strikes and other highly disruptive forms of
industrial action.
Ministers have in the past characterised the POA as a militant trade union
that has resisted change in the prison service. POA members at Manchester
hope to prevent this reputation becoming a barrier to the public sector bid
succeeding.
Wolds, Britain's first privately managed prison, opened on Humberside last
year and the new Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, will open under
private management soon. The contract to run Strangeways - part of the
government's programme of market testing public services - is, however, the
first time the public and private sectors have bid against each other to
manage a prison.
The public sector bid to retain management of Strangeways is expected to
face competition from about five private sector bids, with a final decision
in midsummer.
The deadline for Strangeways bids comes at an awkward moment for ministers
in terms of another element of the policy to open up the criminal justice
system to the private sector - private management of court escort services.
Four prisoners escaped or were wrongly released last week during the first
few days of privately managed escort duties by Group 4 Court Services.
Group 4, which also manages Wolds prison, said it released one of the
prisoners on the orders of a court. It is to meet the director general of
the Prison Service to discuss the situation.
Conservative backbenchers are concerned that further escapes might embarrass
ministers over plans to extend the scheme.

FT  13 APR 93 / Leeds Permanent close to use of bonds in mortgage funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS Permanent Building Society may soon become the first society to fund
mortgages by issuing bonds. The move comes partly in response to societies'
increasing difficulty in attracting deposits from small investors.
Leeds is among a number of societies understood to be planning to diversify
their funding by securitising mortgages.
It may offer investors in the capital markets bonds on which the return is
provided by mortgage borrowers' interest payments.
Leeds said yesterday that it believed it would be capable of securitising
its mortgages, possibly through the vehicle of an off-balance sheet company,
by September, its financial year-end.
Societies are likely to come under increasing pressure this year to find
alternatives to retail funding - using individual savers' deposits to
provide mortgages - if demand for mortgages rises. Their deposit base is
threatened as building society savings accounts face renewed competition
from National Savings and equity products.
If societies gained approval from the Building Societies Commission, the
industry regulator, to offer securities backed by mortgages through off
balance sheet companies, they could achieve more leeway within funding
limits.
Societies as a whole are barred from raising more than 40 per cent of funds
on capital markets under the Building Societies Act, but each society is set
an individual, lower limit, thought to average 30 per cent, by the
commission, according to its view of the strength of their financial
position and experience in the capital markets.
Mr Jon Katovsky, structured finance manager at Leeds, said he believed the
society was closest to being able to provide detailed enough information on
its mortgage lending to satisfy the agencies which give credit ratings,
essential for bonds issued on the capital markets.
Mr Katovsky said the society had already altered the terms of mortgages to
gain permission from borrowers to securitise. He said it was in the process
of changing its computer system to be able to track cash flow and mortgage
accounts.
He said societies would probably be cautious initially, and try out
securitisation techniques on instruments such as mortgage-backed
non-recourse loans from banks. Such loans might also be backed by collateral
from cash funds.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said the issue of
mortgage-backed securities could allow societies to 'avoid a potential
funding constraint' due to attacks on their retail funding base.
Centralised mortgage lenders, which started competing with building
societies in the mid-1980s, have used securitisation of mortgages
extensively, but societies have been constrained by technical difficulties
to do with their status.
The commission is not thought to object in principle to the securitisation
of mortgages by societies, although borrowers would lose their status as
society members if their mortgages were held by a vehicle company.

FT  13 APR 93 / Nato starts policing no-fly zone as Serb barrage kills over
50

NATO FIGHTER aircraft began policing the skies over Bosnia-Hercegovina
yesterday as fighting intensified on the ground with more than 50 killed in
a Serb artillery barrage on the Moslem town of Srebrenica.
A French Mirage jet crashed in the Adriatic because of engine failure soon
after the Nato alliance embarked on its first combat missions since it was
formed in 1949. The pilot ejected and was rescued from the sea.
French, US and Dutch aircraft are being deployed to enforce the no-fly zone
imposed by the United Nations over Bosnia in a move aimed at putting more
pressure on the Serbs to accept a peace settlement. The fighters will be
supported by Nato early warning aircraft carrying multinational crews,
including Germans on their first combat mission since the second world war.
But western diplomats held out little hope that shooting down any violators
of the ban on flights would end the bloodshed in Bosnia.
General Manojlo Milovanovic, deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, said
his forces would not open fire or provoke incidents but would carry on
normal operations. 'The Serbs will carry on with their business as usual.
They will defend their territories, and liberate more, and if Nato has oil
to spare then it can chase its own tail in the Bosnia-Hercegovina sky,' he
said.
As the Nato aircraft began their patrols, fighting on the ground broke out
in spite of a UN-negotiated ceasefire.
In Srebrenica, where thousands of Moslems have been besieged by Serb forces,
56 people were reported killed and 73 seriously injured in a Serb artillery
attack.
Serb forces besieging Sarajevo shelled the city as military leaders of the
mainly Moslem Bosnian forces boycotted UN-mediated talks at Sarajevo
airport. General Sefer Halilovic, commander of the Bosnian army, said he
would refuse to meet General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, until
Serb forces halted attacks on Srebrenica and a ceasefire was in effect for
24 hours in eastern Bosnia.
General Lars-Erik Wahlgren, the commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia,
held talks with Gen Mladic to press for a ceasefire and for Serb forces to
stop blocking the deployment of 150 Canadian peacekeepers in Srebrenica.
In New York, UN officials confirmed it was unlikely that the Security
Council would decide on a tough new package of sanctions against Serbia. The
officials said the decision to put off a vote on sanctions for up to two
weeks was to accommodate Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who faces a
crucial referendum on April 25. The Russian leader is anxious to avoid
opposition charges that he is selling out the Serbs, Moscow's traditional
allies.

FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes Mr Brian Pitman of Lloyds Bank sounds more like a retailer than
Britain's foremost clearing banker. At a Hoare Govett seminar last week, he
was at pains to stress the scope for using the bank's distribution network
to increase return. The bank does not need to confine itself to distributing
its own financial products. There is nothing wrong in selling those
manufactured by others. Nothing could be further from the old-fashioned idea
that banks grow rich by expanding their loan book. Indeed, Mr Pitman
believes high capital requirements are a useful way of preventing them
falling into this trap. But he also believes in high targets for return on
capital.
The trouble is that these aims can become contradictory. The activities of
the future are those, like private banking, which absorb little capital. But
the more successful Lloyds becomes with this approach, the more retained
earnings will swell its capital, putting the return targets out of reach.
The natural response would be to expand by acquisition if a target could be
found at the right price. If not, consistency will require Mr Pitman to give
surplus capital back to shareholders.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One drawback of the all-encompassing earnings figure arising from FRS3 is
that it is more a record of all that has been happening than a real
indicator of profitability. The kitchen-sink approach of the new accounting
standard makes a nonsense of comparisons both between companies and
reporting periods. Hence the quest for a method of adjusting FRS3 to provide
a standard measure of underlying performance.
The Institute of Investment Management and Research has rightly proposed
that such an adjustment should be founded on the removal of non-trading,
capital items from FRS3 earnings. Profits from the sale of assets - such as
property trading profits taken by hotel groups - have little to do with
trading performance. Those on the sale or termination of businesses should
be excluded on the same principle. The results of discontinued businesses
should be left in to provide a historic measure of performance, which is the
best that adjustment can hope to do. Attempting to define maintainable
earnings would involve too many subjective judgments.
A bigger controversy relates to the cost of fundamental restructuring. Such
charges occur infrequently and can be very large. The temptation is to
exclude them from underlying earnings too. But the line between frequent and
infrequent is blurred and companies might use the opportunity to hide all
manner of costs in their normalised earnings.
Including fundamental restructuring charges in adjusted earnings would
require additional disclosure at the preliminary stage. Otherwise the market
would be left guessing the level of tax relief on restructuring costs while
it waited for the annual report. The scope for error could be large.
Indeed, the quest for an earnings adjustment formula places an onus on
companies to publish comprehensive information at the preliminary stage.
That could be seen as an opportunity rather than a problem. If a benchmark
level of preliminary disclosure can be set alongside a benchmark earnings
adjustment, companies falling short will have some explaining to do. That
may be the greatest prize of all.

FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new French government will be disappointed to find the family silver so
tarnished. The loss forecast last week by Pechiney, the aluminium group, was
only the latest bleak statement from the state sector. Recession need not
scupper the whole privatisation programme. The French equity market has
risen by 20 per cent since last autumn in spite of the cyclical pain.
Rhone-Poulenc's share offering in January showed that profits warnings and
privatisation are not mutually exclusive. Interest-rate sensitive banks
rather than industrial companies may now be front runners - provided their
balance sheets can be cleaned up in short order.
But privatisation on any scale will require a shift of domestic savings into
equities. The government's manifesto pledge to raise FFr40bn-60bn a year for
the next five years would test the domestic equity market. Equity issues in
Paris amounted to little more than FFr15bn last year and FFr30bn in 1991.
Lower interest rates and tax breaks might be required to attract the
FFr1,300bn savings now held in money-market funds. That is not in the gift
of a government committed to franc fort. The government will doubtless try
to attract overseas capital without surrendering industry to the risk of
foreign control. Relying on international capital will mean competing with
other cash-strapped European governments, especially in sectors such as
energy. Spain has already attracted foreign cash into Repsol this year.
Italy may yet put Eni on the block. Elf Acquitaine will not want to be last
in the queue.

FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Airlines loop the loop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in airlines has long been a matter of hope deferred. Last week's
flurry in airline shares on both sides of the Atlantic suggests investors
are looking on the bright side once again.
The US carriers responded to good traffic figures and news that President
Bill Clinton was establishing a commission to investigate the industry's
difficulties. The simplest solution may be to change Chapter 11
administration procedures, allowing the weakest carriers to go truly bust
and removing surplus capacity. But that would hardly be politically correct.
Some re-regulation and increasing toughness with foreign governments during
forthcoming bilateral aviation talks appear the easier options. Such
aggression would unsettle state-cossetted European airlines - although both
BA and KLM would benefit from any general market liberalisation.
The commission may simply conclude that the best strategy is to let market
forces run their course. Like many other capital-intensive industries,
airlines accentuate their plight by adding too much capacity at the top of
the cycle and investing too little in recession. With the growth rate of
airline fleets slowing sharply and passenger demand set to rebound over the
next few years, there should soon be a big upswing in airlines'
profitability. The trouble is it may not arrive until 1995. It is too early
for investors to buy for that recovery.

FT  13 APR 93 / Leading Article: Hurry up, Mr Schlesinger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS interest rate decisions, the Bundesbank has chosen to imitate the
tortoise rather than the hare. This looks increasingly unwise. Its job is to
secure monetary stability in Germany. Sharp reductions in the interest rates
it sets seem consistent with its objectives. They should not be further
delayed.
The Bundesbank is right to worry about current disputes over the foolish
commitment to reach pay parity between eastern and western Germany in 1994.
Pay trends in the east have national significance. The smaller the
competitive pressures from eastern Germany, the more difficult it will be
for the Bundesbank to achieve its target for inflation.
Furthermore, high pay and high unemployment in eastern Germany will ensure
the prolongation of the current budgetary drain into the indefinite future.
The all-German public sector borrowing requirement is running at about 6 per
cent of total German gross domestic product. Given the recession and the
number of elections next year, it is likely to be at that level, or higher,
for many years.
These are good reasons for concern. But the Bundesbank is responsible
neither for the terms of German monetary union, nor for subsequent fiscal
policy. It is only responsible for ensuring that the mistakes of others are
not validated by monetary policy.
That aim has now been achieved. The best single indicator of success is
long-term interest rates. At a little over 6 1/2 per cent, these are some
two and a half percentage points below their levels at the beginning of
1991. They have been below current levels only for three brief periods in
the last 25 years. Credibility has been regained.
The price has been high. It is true that the economy is coming off the top
of an economic expansion lasting a decade, during which west German GDP rose
by 31 per cent. But GDP fell by 1.4 per cent between the first and last
quarters of 1992. More dramatically, industrial output has fallen by 11 per
cent from its peak in early 1992, to levels last seen in mid-1989.
Meanwhile, broad money supply (M3) has shrunk in early 1993. This does,
indeed, follow gross overshooting of last year's targets, but that
overshooting reflected exceptional factors, including foreign exchange
intervention within the European exchange rate mechanism. Furthermore, the
rapid monetary growth of 1992 has as yet produced no subsequent boost to
domestic demand and should probably be ignored.
Inflation subdued
Inflation is more subdued than it looks. The annual rise in hourly wages has
fallen from 7 per cent in 1991 to a little over 4 per cent. The Bundesbank
remains concerned about consumer price inflation; the latest annual rate is
4.3 per cent, more than twice its target. But this overshooting in
substantial part reflects higher housing costs and higher administered
prices, including increases in value added tax. Yet higher administered
prices and indirect taxes are the inevitable consequence of efforts made to
improve the public finances, for which the Bundesbank itself has called.
The Bundesbank should also recognise that its policies have brought
disinflation to the entire ERM zone. But that effect also threatens its own
domestic achievements. To the extent that high short-term interest rates
undermine currency stability, they weaken the credibility of ERM parities
and force large-scale foreign exchange intervention, which then undermines
domestic monetary control.
In all, a forward-looking central bank would now be cutting interest rates
sharply. Nor would this be unprecedented in Germany. It is what the
Bundesbank did between August 1982 and March 1983, when the discount rate
was lowered from 7.5 to 4 per cent.
This time things have been very different. The discount rate has been
lowered by a mere 1 1/4 percentage points since September 1992. The
three-month rate of interest is about 8 per cent, down only some 1 3/4
percentage points from its peak in the middle of last year. Not only are the
reductions themselves small, but short rates remain well above long rates.
Extreme caution
The Bundesbank's rationalisation for what seems to be extreme caution is
fear of the effects of interest rate reductions on the exchange rate and
long-term interest rates. It also argues that short-term interest rates are
not particularly important for German economic activity. These arguments are
far from persuasive.
The expectation in the markets is that short-rates of interest will be below
6 per cent by the end of the year and lower still in 1994. Faster movement
towards a recognised destination may not weaken the D-Mark, which has
already fallen against the yen and the US dollar since last autumn.
Furthermore, the German recession means that a depreciation of the D-Mark
against the dollar, which would not be matched by one against most European
currencies, is unlikely to be inflationary.
As for the feared effect on long-term interest rates, the way to find out is
by trial and error. Should long-term interest rates soar - or the D-Mark
plunge - short-term rates can always be increased once more. But there are
already strong forces working towards low long-term interest rates. It is
difficult to accept that the current yield curve is needed to achieve that
result.
Finally, short-term interest rates do matter to Germany. Some 80 per cent of
credit to industry is indeed long term, but much of this is at variable
rates of interest, themselves determined by short-term rates of interest.
Furthermore, the Bundesbank tends to forget that short-term rates of
interest matter even more to neighbouring countries. Yet if the Bundesbank
brings contraction to France, it also reinforces the recession in Germany.
The Bundesbank should stop prevaricating. Short-term rates should probably
be at least 1 1/2 percentage points lower than now, a level which would
still give Germany a flat yield curve. Its job is not to make political
points. Now that credibility has been restored, it is time to adjust
interest rates sharply. Further delay cannot be justified.

Is this another Silicon Valley in the making? The favoured spot for
Britain's new breed of telephone bankers is. . . . West Yorkshire.
Firstdirect, the Midland Bank pioneer, is based just outside Leeds and now
it has been joined in Bradford by PrimeLine, National Westminster's
experimental competitor. Market researchers say that the spot was picked not
for its water, cheapness of labour, or its natives' ability to count money,
but because of the soothing West Yorkshire accent.
Firstdirect spent a lot of money finding out which regional accent the
British most liked. Bottom of the table came Liverpool scouse because most
people found it too harsh. Scottish and cockney were also rejected. This
left West Yorkshire, which sounded warm and friendly.
Both banks now claim that they have access to staff whom customers like the
sound of.

It is not just the residents of Los Angeles who have strong feelings about
the case against the four white police officers accused of violating black
man Rodney King's civil rights.
The ugly video film of a man being beaten while he was on the ground has
meant that everyone from Paris to Tokyo has a view on a drama which
threatens to inflame Los Angeles again.
Less well known is the fact that when it comes to racial balance in
recruitment, the record of Los Angeles' police department is above average.
According to a recent University of Nebraska survey of the ethnic mix in 50
US city police forces, New York has the lowest ratio of black police
officers to black residents whilst LA is top.
Some 14 per cent of its officers are black, which is in line with the black
proportion of the city's population.

Lucky old Rocco Forte, the chairman and chief executive of the UK's largest

that he dare not cut the company dividend for fear of inciting the corporate
governance lobby which argues that he should split the job of chairman and
chief executive.
But wise old heads in the City have been arguing for some time that a
dividend cut was not only prudent, but an absolute necessity to reduce
gearing. Then came the suspension of shares in Queens Moat Houses, Forte's
leading rival, two weeks ago.
Suddenly, even Forte's most avid City supporters are forecasting a cut in
the dividend later this week and arguing that it would be a statesmanlike
move.

It is buying Lepel, number three in the Italian brassiere market, and would

British women, explains Sherwood chairman David Parker, come in a much wider

If Lord Hanson can do it, why can't Malcolm Walker, Britain's frozen food

from an increasingly common affliction of Britain's multi-millionaire class.
He has caught the radio bug.
Walker, 47, who transformed a roadside strawberry stall into a Pounds 600m
retailing growth stock, wants to open a commercial radio station in his
company's north-west back yard. He has persuaded Chrysalis, the media group,
and Greenalls, the brewers, to help him start Heart FM.
Not that he has the field to himself. There are plenty of other likely lads
ranging from Owen Oyston, the socialist millionaire, to former Granada boss
David Plowright, who fancy their chances of being the voice of the
north-west.
But Walker's big advantage is his marketing flair. He's already playing
tapes of Heart FM's romantic, easy listening music in Iceland's 100-plus
shops in the region. And in case customers are not listening, he has
plastered his shop windows with giant posters - Heart FM, the future sound
of the north-west?
But is this the sort of message that the City wants to hear? It is one thing
for a veteran businessman like Lord Hanson to indulge himself by setting up
Melody Radio. But Walker is a relative newcomer to the stock market and a
good 20 years younger than Melody Radio's promoter. Unlike Lord Hanson,
Walker still has to prove his staying power. Better to stick to frozen food
for a bit longer, Malcolm.

FT  13 APR 93 / Sacrifice in the name of security: British business and
unions are showing increasing willingness to forgo higher pay in order to
retain their jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 20,000 employees of Sheffield City Council and the 750 staff of John
Brown Engineers and Constructors in Portsmouth are exceptional groups of
workers: both have accepted pay cuts for all to prevent job losses for some.
British workers and employers, unlike their American or Japanese
counterparts, have rarely been inclined to apply the trade-off between pay
restraint and job security, either at national or plant level. But if the
slight fall in February's unemployment, reported last month, proves an
exception - as expected - interest in the link between jobs and pay is
likely to increase.
Both business and union leaders are breaking with tradition and,
tentatively, putting the idea of trading higher pay for job security on the
agenda. The Trades Union Congress has said that there is 'some scope' for
the trade-off in the public sector.
More specifically, Mr Howard Davies, the innovative new head of the
Confederation of British Industry, said recently that the pain of recession
had been borne very unevenly, warning that social stability in Britain could
be threatened if pay increases take priority over jobs when recovery gets
under way.
At first sight it is curious that pay levels should be singled out for
attention. Few people blame pay directly for the recession or believe it to
be an obstacle to recovery. 'Pay is now a second order problem,' according
to Dr Walter Eltis, economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary.
The figures appear to support this view: the absolute levels of settlements
and earnings increases are now at the lowest level for decades, pay freezes
are once again on the increase, and in January manufacturing unit labour
costs (pay per unit of output) fell by 2.2 per cent compared with January
1992.
But Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, an independent
research body, says that such statistics disguise the anti-employment bias
behind Britain's pay system, a bias which becomes especially marked in
recession.
'To put it in a rather stylised way, there are companies where half the
workers are losing their jobs and the other half are virtually doubling
their pay. That is bad for employment and bad for the economy as a whole,'
says Mr Trinder.
The reality is not quite that bad, but it is true that real earnings growth
for those in work has been greater in this recession than in the previous
two, while the fall in employment has also been greater. Last year, average
UK earnings grew at 6.1 per cent, almost double the inflation rate of 3.7
per cent. In 1981, in the middle of the last recession, average earnings of
12.9 per cent were only one percentage point above inflation of 11.9 per
cent. Similarly, in the first two years of the current recession employment
fell by more than 2m compared with 1.5m in the early 1980s.
The increased earnings in this recession have often been the result of
efficiency deals which helped manufacturing productivity to rise by a
healthy 6.4 per cent in the quarter to the end of January. But, economists
say, that usually means producing the same amount with fewer workers rather
than producing more with the same number.
The result is that unit labour costs are heading down but joblessness
heading up. And while earnings for those in work rise, personal disposable
income in the economy as a whole fell in the last quarter of 1992, thanks to
the sharp fall in income experienced by the rising number of the unemployed.
This undermines expansion. But from the viewpoint of individual companies
the high pay/low employment trade-off makes sense. Indeed, in big companies,
the system encourages it: shareholders like to be told that the corporate
'headcount' is falling and managers and unions have an interest in pleasing
the workers who remain.
ICI, for example, this year began paying 14.5 per cent productivity-linked
pay rises to most of its 20,000 hourly-paid workers. It has also announced
that more than 10,000 jobs will be cut in the UK over the next year. Mr
David Thomas, of the ICI planning department, says that 95 per cent of the
job losses have nothing to do with the pay increase, but he does concede
that lower pay rises might have allowed the company to recruit more new
workers.
According to UBS, the stockbrokers, employment in the UK chemical industry
between 1981 and 1992 fell by about 25 per cent, a much higher drop than in
Germany, France, America and Japan, but wage costs rose by 160 per cent
compared with about 60 per cent in the other countries.
In other sectors privatisation has recently been exacerbating this trend.
This is the first post-privatisation recession and the combination of
government sell-offs and the efficiency drive in the public services has
undermined the stabilising effect on employment formerly played by the
public sector. BT is a good example. The telecommunications company employed
238,000 people before privatisation in 1984; the figure is now 165,000 and
by 1997 it could be down to 100,000.
Other privatised utilities have adopted similar policies, although none has
gone as far as BT. British Gas employed 90,000 just before privatisation
1986 and is now down to about 79,000, while the electricity industry in
England and Wales employed 131,398 before privatisation in 1990 and now
employs about 115,000.
Those who remain in the privatised companies are generally reaping
substantial rewards for improved productivity. At National Grid, for
example, which runs the electricity network in England and Wales, employment
has fallen from 6,500 to 5,500 over the past two years and most workers this
year will receive a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.
A once-and-for-all shake-out of labour may be desireable, and unavoidable,
in the privatised utilities, and few want to return to the inefficiency of
the nationalised industries. But Mr Trinder argues that it is bad timing for
the government to be seeking heavy job cuts in the public services when
unemployment is rising. He argues that the cost in extra welfare benefits
and the dent to consumer confidence outweigh the benefits of greater
efficiency, which can still be achieved at a later date.
Costs, he adds, can be held down by extending the current public sector pay
limit for another year. But, he believes, such a limit should be linked to a
guarantee of job security, thus making it more palatable and preserving
hundreds of thousands of jobs. Increased staff productivity should still be
encouraged but would be expressed in better services rather than fewer
employees.
Many commentators remain sceptical about establishing a new trade-off
between pay and jobs, especially in the private sector. Mr Esmond Lindop, of
pay analysts Incomes Data Services, says that the trade-off only works over
short periods to cover emergencies. He also points out that short-time
working, where companies cut the working week and pay-packets but keep the
workforce together, has never been very popular even in tough times.
Some economists such as Mr Kevin Gardiner, at S G Warburg, believe, more
fundamentally, that employment is much less responsive to changes in wage
levels than to consumer demand for particular products.
Even some supporters of a more employment-friendly trade-off are pessimistic
about how it can be made to work, especially in an upturn, without national
level deals between unions and employers, something increasingly rare in
British industrial relations.
But there is no logical reason why the trade-off cannot be made at the level
of the individual factory or office. Indeed some economists stress that the
trade-off is easier to apply at that level, rather than sector or
company-wide, because it is more tangible for the people involved and runs
with the recent trend of decentralised pay bargaining.
There is evidence that managers at local level are finally heeding the
advice of Mr Davies of the CBI to push down harder on pay to preserve
employment. Few of the current pay freezes are explicitly linked to job
security, like that at Rolls Royce Aerospace last year. But Mr Tony de
Launay, of the Engineering Employers Federation, reports that such freezes
in the engineering sector often involve an informal trade-off with job
security. Whether such deals will prosper in more buoyant times is more
doubtful.

FT  13 APR 93 / Leading Article: Patten's task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL GOOD education reforms are initially opposed by one group of teachers or
another. Few achieve the distinction of being condemned by the three largest
teaching unions, headmasters, many parents, and a strong contingent of
right-wing educational theorists. Yet just such an unlikely army has lined
up against the national curriculum and its associated system of national
tests. In consequence, the process started by the Education Reform Act of
1988 is likely to be set back by a summer of disruption.
It is difficult to see what the secretary for education, Mr John Patten, can
do next. He has not spent his first year in office well: he failed either to
refine the tests and curriculum in time to head off the opposition or to
persuade the educational community to work with the government. After 12
months of building a reputation for rigidity he finally agreed last week
that there should be a thorough review, while appealing for this year's
tests to go ahead. The response of the usually moderate Association of
Teachers and Lecturers was to ballot its members on a boycott of testing.
The National Union of Teachers followed suit on Saturday. A third union, the
NAS/UWT had already voted for a ballot.
Two weeks ago Wandsworth council asked the High Court for an injunction
against a proposed boycott by the NAS/UWT. This was refused. Wandsworth will
appeal. Mr Patten will presumably wait for the outcome. If the courts
declare boycotts of the tests illegal the government's hand will be
strengthened, although perhaps not sufficiently to restore order in all
classrooms. If not, the education secretary may be obliged to declare this
year's tests 'voluntary', which would mean that in many schools they would
not take place at all. The government would no longer control the pace of
its education reforms.
The damage would be limited if such a forced concession applied to the year
1993 alone. All political parties agree on the desirability of a national
curriculum and testing, both of which are necessary if the quality of
education in state schools is to be improved. There is almost universal
agreement on the need to revise the complicated 10-level assessment scale,
with its extensive examination of pupils at the ages of 7, 11, and 14.
Mr Patten must work to establish confidence in the new School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority (SCAA), which already has a chairman, Sir Ron Dearing,
who needs to demonstrate that his executive will be broadly based and
willing to consult interested parties. The SCAA should also declare that its
deliberations will not be conducted in secret; it should welcome public
debate. Such a demonstration of the government's good intentions is
necessary if Mr Patten is to start winning arguments and allies.

FT  13 APR 93 / Personal View: Seeds of crisis in a flawed farm deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUC GUYAU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's negotiating partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks ought to prepare themselves for a French veto to the US-European
Commission deal on agriculture. For there is bound to be a veto. The case in
favour of such a step rests on strong arguments, which go way beyond
agriculture and will consequently be given due regard by the newly elected
French government.
Of course, my union fights first and foremost on behalf of its farmers. We
will press for a rejection by the European Community of the deal on farm
policies, which we consider to be lopsided and flawed. The deal would make
European farmers lose large market shares, both domestic and foreign. Prices
and incomes would fall substantially and in the end Europe's current Common
Agricultural Policy would be torn to pieces.
The caps on so-called 'subsidised' exports would be especially damaging,
particularly for France and Britain, which export respectively 60 and 30 per
cent of their total grain output. But all member-states ought to concern
themselves with those export caps, which will inevitably put a strong
downward pressure on domestic prices as output surpluses are rechannelled
towards EC markets.
But there is far more than this to the dispute. At stake, in my view, is
Europe's emancipation and its capacity to project itself as a world power in
the international arena.
What I have tried to do as president of the French farmers' union is
systematically to point to the failings and the shortcomings of the EC
institutions. Second, I have made the case that the EC will need agriculture
and food exports in the decades ahead if it is to yield influence as a world
power.
Look at the demographic trends. The world population is expected to double
within 53 years and the boom will be greater still at the periphery of
Europe, where food is especially scarce. In just 40 years the population of
Africa will grow threefold.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has called on all
countries to increase their output to meet the forecast surge in food
demand. Now, the GATT draft agreement on agriculture requires that the EC
cut its subsidised exports - making it impossible for the EC to meet the
demand. What is more, practically speaking, the US is exempt from this
limitation only because its export subsidies are based on a budgetary
mechanism different from that of the EC.
In the end, only the US would be allowed to carry on exporting - thereby
enabling it to retain the possibility of using food as a foreign policy
weapon. A Gatt agreement on agriculture is needed, but first I would insist
that Europe has enough foresight to give itself the means to break such a
monopoly.
In the current negotiations, the European Commission has taken a
short-sighted approach and sought to secure a deal at any cost in the hope
that it would give the world economy a shot in the arm.
In addition, the Commission has not had the slightest regard for the views
of ministers of the member states. We must make sure democracy is respected
to the full. The mandate handed by the ministers on November 20 1990 was
by-passed by Brussels, which is now using the deal it has struck with the US
to force on EC ministers fresh reform of the CAP reform.
The Commission has clearly overstepped its boundaries. It is high time
democracy was brought back into the institutions of Europe and Europe's
interests were no longer said to clash with those of individual member
states.
What then should be done in the short term? First, member states should not
accept a Gatt agreement at any price. They must take a close look at the way
the Commission defends Europe's interests. They must press the case that the
Commission is only the executive branch and that it is for them to give
clear directives.
Second, member states must use the Uruguay Round trade negotiations to
design a comprehensive, ambitious trade policy for Europe. They cannot go on
being ordered around and giving in to diplomatic pressure or to
unsubstantiated threats of trade sanctions. Only after drawing a clear
picture of objectives should member states seat themselves at the
negotiating table.
Ours are not parochial arguments. Enough is at stake for France to be
willing to take the risk of a crisis with the US or even with its European
partners. The new French government can indeed be expected to veto the farm
agreement in order to seek a new, balanced and fair deal with the US.
It is for Europe to build itself.

FT  13 APR 93 / Cut-price cowboy: Marlboro's falling sales say more about
the market than the brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the late 1980s, brands have acquired cult status in western business,
where faith in their supposedly guaranteed earning power has prompted many
high-priced corporate takeovers. However, Philip Morris's recent decision to
slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes in an effort to reverse their
declining share of the US market suggests that faith needs to be
re-examined.
Marlboro is one of the few genuinely global brands. Like Coca-Cola,
McDonalds and Sony, it commands instantaneous recognition almost everywhere.
In many poorer parts of the world, its American imagery also makes it a
powerful aspirational symbol, promising status, stylishness and a better
standard of living.
These are just the sorts of qualities which make strong brands desirable
assets - their firm grip on consumer loyalty is supposed to enable them to
ride above the competitive fray, piling up profits while lesser rivals
scrabble in the dust. Only last year, a US business magazine pronounced
Marlboro the world's most valuable brand worth by the magazine's calculation
Dollars 31bn.
So what has gone wrong? Conventional wisdom holds that brands usually lose
their effectiveness when starved of advertising and marketing support. But
Philip Morris cannot be faulted on that score. It has regularly backed
Marlboro with an annual marketing budget of more than Dollars 100m in the US
alone - four times the spending by its closest rival.
How well that money has been spent is, of course, debatable. Some critics
believe the Marlboro cowboy, the brand's long-established symbol, may be out
of tune with the times. It is also true that regulatory controls on tobacco
advertising in the US - and many other countries - have limited the range of
persuasive techniques producers can legally deploy.
However, the most plausible explanation for Marlboro's falling sales lies
not with the brand but with the product. Faced with a growing choice of
cheaper alternatives, many US smokers seem to have concluded that Marlboro
cigarettes do not offer anything special enough to justify a premium price.
If so, that leaves Philip Morris with a problem - though far from a unique
one.
Many products which once traded heavily on marketing imagery have recently
encountered growing consumer resistance. Grocery manufacturers' brands face
increasing pressure from supermarkets' cheaper own-label lines, while
discount retailers flourish. German luxury cars have been successfully
challenged by less expensive Japanese rivals. American Express business
credit cards - synonymous with the executive expense account - have fallen
on leaner times.
Recessionary belt-tightening is partly to blame. But it is not just that
consumers are spending less; they have also become more discriminating about
getting genuine value at all price levels. Customers have not deserted
Mercedes-Benz for ordinary family saloons but for marques such as Toyota's
Lexus, which are comparably engineered and equipped. Other charge cards now
offer more cheaply services once unique to American Express. The
profitability of leading British supermarkets owes much to their success in
offering high quality own-label groceries which compete directly with the
brand leaders.
Threatened brand leaders cannot regain supremacy simply by cutting prices or
increasing advertising if the products and services they offer are no longer
competitive. Consumers need to be convinced that, by paying more, they are
getting something demonstrably different or better. In a few cases, such as
scotch whisky, where heritage and provenance are important, this may be
possible by emphasising exclusivity. But usually the answer must involve
improving existing products and developing new ones.
Most well-known brands, for example, Coca Cola, grew originally out of
product innovations. Long-lasting ones owe their longevity to their owners'
continued resourcefulness and business skills. Superior processing
technology and manufacturing know-how are important elements in the enduring
success of Nescafe and Kellogg's breakfast cereals. The competitive strength
of Benetton and Marks and Spencer depends heavily on their sophisticated
arrangements with suppliers. Swatch has prospered by allying fashion flair
with exceptionally rapid product development and highly efficient
production.
A problem for branded cigarette manufacturers is that there is little they
can usefully do to improve on or differentiate the basic product. RJR's
disastrous project to develop a smoke-less cigarette a few years ago proves
the point. Nor are scale economies in production or distribution of critical
importance. If advertising imagery fails to keep consumers loyal,
competition in the industry may increasingly be based on price.
The central lesson is that a brand's value is determined ultimately by the
quality of the product or service to which it is attached and of the
business producing it. A strong brand is not a guarantee of success. It is
the reward earned - often over a long period - by a company adding value by
consistently satisfying customers and staying ahead of the competition.
At a time when corporate performance in many industries depends increasingly
on attributes such as reputation and service, there is a genuine need for
more precise methods to measure the value of intangibles. But the issues
have so far been as much obscured as clarified by the recent debate over the
merits of putting brands on balance sheets.
Efforts to put a price on brands involve, at best, highly subjective
judgments and amount, at worst, to a mechanistic checklist exercise. But
however diligently carried out, they are necessarily coloured by past
performance. They offer few verifiable insights into how and why that
performance was achieved and, hence, whether it can be maintained. But in
the real world, that is what really counts.

FT  13 APR 93 / Signs of resilience in a fragile society: The measured
reaction to the assassination of Chris Hani suggests South Africa is
committed to negotiated reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst may be yet to come. Black South Africans may yet seek revenge for
their assassinated hero, Mr Chris Hani, who now awaits a martyr's funeral.
But by local standards of violence, the Easter weekend was a relatively
quiet one in South Africa.
On Saturday, Mr Hani, head of the South African Communist party and
guerrilla leader, fell to a white assassin's bullet. But black South
Africans did not revolt. They fumed, and mourned, marched and threw stones,
fired shots at passing motorists. In the worst incident, blacks incinerated
three white men outside an illegal bar in a black township in the Cape.
But a few racial incidents do not necessarily suggest a race war is about to
start. In a society renowned for its political intolerance and crime (some
18,000 people were killed last year, 13 per cent of them in political
violence) the weekend death toll was unusually low.
Almost every political party condemned the assassination in the strongest
possible terms. Even Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the
white-supremacist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance
Movement), the party to which the alleged murderer is rumoured to belong,
condemned the killing as 'atrocious'.
Unanimity is rare in this fractured society, but the almost unanimous
instinct of leaders from extreme left to hard right was to stress the need
to talk, not fight. It was a striking affirmation of South Africa's
commitment to negotiating peace and a new constitution.
Their restraint was already coming under increasing pressure last night, as
the African National Congress announced mass protest action leading up to
the largest political funeral ever held in South Africa, to mark the
assassination of Mr Hani.
No man in South Africa was better loved by the poor, the young and the
radical in black society (certainly the majority). That they have contained
their rage and resentment thus far is a remarkable achievement, a hopeful
sign that South Africa's tortured society is perhaps more resilient than it
appears.
Race relations will inevitably suffer, as they have already done in recent
months as white party-goers, schoolchildren and motorists have come under
attack from the radical black Azanian People's Liberation Army and some
disaffected members of the ANC.
But inter-racial relations in South Africa have defied the logic of
apartheid for decades already: black and white relate more cordially in
South Africa than in some American inner-cities. The ANC yesterday condemned
attacks on whites, pointing out to its supporters that if the hand that
killed Mr Hani was white, the information that led to his arrest also came
from a white witness.
'Thirty years ago, the possibility of race war was always in my mind,' says
veteran liberal politician Mr Zach de Beer. 'It has steadily receded since.
One passage of history after another makes me believe that South Africans
don't think like that.'
Some of them do, of course. Black callers to a weekend radio talk show
demanded that 'every red and every white corpuscle of Chris Hani's blood
must be accounted for' - and avenged - while white callers complained at the
media attention given to the Hani assassination. Reversing the classic
complaint made by blacks under apartheid, one white caller protested: 'a
white life is worth nothing, but if a black gets killed, it's treated like a
big tragedy.' That comment reflects one of the dangers of the current
situation: for whites can use this new-found sense of oppression to justify
their own liberation struggle.
Ironically, reaction would almost certainly have been worse if Mr Hani had
been murdered by the ANC's black rivals, the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom
party, rather than as he allegedly was, by a white immigrant from Poland
with a virulent hatred of communism.
White extremists such as Mr Janusz Walus, who will today be charged with the
Hani murder, pose far less threat to peace than the ongoing war between the
ANC and Inkatha.
There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that Mr Walus was part of an
organised extremist movement: the gun he allegedly used for the murder was
stolen from air force headquarters in Pretoria in 1990 by white supremacist
Piet 'Skiet' (shoot) Rudolf, formerly a member of the AWB.
Crucially, the assassination did not bear obvious hallmarks of the
'hit-squad' killings carried out in the past by the security services: Mr
Walus allegedly killed Mr Hani in full view of an eyewitness, using a car
easily traceable to him; he was apprehended moments after the attack, with
the murder weapon still in his possession and gunpowder traces on his hand.
South Africa's hit squads normally show more professionalism.
Still, even if a full police investigation shows that Mr Walus has no
security force links, no one in the townships will believe it. So many black
South Africans have been murdered by the police and military over long years
of struggle that blacks acknowledge only one salient fact: that a white has
killed the man who was probably South Africa's greatest liberation fighter,
former head of the revered Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the ANC
military wing, and the second most popular man in South Africa after Nelson
Mandela (according to a recent opinion poll).
Mr Hani was a potential successor to Mr Mandela for the ANC leadership
(though the more moderate Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, would
probably have defeated him). But among township youth, the unemployed and
disaffected, Mr Hani's leadership was undisputed: no other ANC leader could
so easily make compromise seem like triumph, could argue for peace as a form
of struggle (as he so effectively did in the last weeks of his life); in
short, could guarantee to deliver the radical youth behind a negotiated
settlement.
That is what makes Mr Hani's death such a tragedy. For the ANC has made
clear that, far from halting negotiations in protest, it will pursue
constitutional talks with renewed vigour. Those talks have proceeded
smoothly in recent months, with an outline deal already in place between the
ANC and government to install a multi-racial power-sharing coalition. That
deal, as well as the crucial issue of devolution of power to regional
governments, must be agreed by the 20-odd other political organisations
attending the multi-party constitutional forum.
Progress in the forum has largely been achieved by deferring contentious
issues for future consideration, leading to unrealistic optimism about the
pace of progress: ANC leaders are still promising that a multi-racial
'transitional executive council' (the first phase of interim government)
will be in place by June, but this looks an impossible goal.
The ANC will be pressing harder than ever for interim government now,
arguing that joint control of the security forces is essential to control
violence.
But even if that can be agreed, the large differences remaining between
negotiators guarantee that talks will eventually hit a snag - and Chris Hani
will no longer be there to ensure that such a breakdown does not lead to
township revolt.
The next few days will sorely test the ability of other ANC leaders to step
into that void and the will of the security forces to contain protest
without brutality: in short, the capacity of South African society to
withstand this blow with political maturity and calm. So far, so restrained.

<TEXT>
Sir, It was high time for David Marsh's thought-provoking piece, 'Caught out
by the turning tide' (April 8). But I'm not too convinced that German
unification, though often cited as the culprit, is the fundamental problem.
Sure, this has led to German interest rates, both short and long, remaining
high at a time of cyclical downturn in output and demand - but only because
of what the Bundesbank considers excessive fiscal expansionism by Bonn
(justifiably when you consider current German inflation).
It need not have been so had Bonn evolved a more thought-out policy towards
unification. But this is like saying that the Germans, who panic when
confronted by anything so organisationally imperfect as the former East
Germany, should not be German.
The crisis in western Europe stems more from the simple fact that a cheap
labour area has opened up to the east. This is akin to flying China over by
helicopter and dumping it on top of the formerly frozen communist world the
other side of the Berlin Wall.
There are few west European industries that are so non-labour intensive that
they can compete with the wage costs in east Europe. These are well below
the equivalent of DM5 a month, compared to DM40 in west Germany, and around
DM30 elsewhere in the EC, according to the IW Institute of Cologne. Perhaps
it is time for west Europeans to realise how uncompetitive they have been.
Perhaps it is time to wake up to the world's real challenges - environment,
famine, Aids, underdevelopment - and begin to confront them in a more
responsible manner.
One thing Britain has to realise in this whole equation is that it is no use
getting out the paddles and rowing off toward the US. Britain may be
separated by water from the Continent, but its industries face precisely the
same challenges. It is high time, therefore, for the UK government to cease
jeering from the sidelines and construct policies, not separate from, but in
common with its European partners.

FT  13 APR 93 / Letter: BR should use leasing finance to buy British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH BAYLEY MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chancellor's announcement in the Autumn Statement that Pounds 150m
of leasing finance would be made available for British Rail to acquire new
trains provided a lifeline to British railway rolling stock manufacturers
whose order books have been hit by the uncertainty caused by railway
privatisation.
Richard Tomkins reports ('InterCity bids for Pounds 150m to lease trains',
March 30) that BR is deciding whether to use the finance to lease suburban
trains for London commuters or for InterCity 225 trains for services between
London and Manchester. If the order is for commuter trains it would probably
go to ABB Transportation - the only British company that has the ability to
build modern aluminium-bodied carriages. If the money is used for InterCity
trains the order will go to GEC Alsthom. GEC does not manufacture carriages
in Britain and, with past orders, it has bought in body shells from abroad.
I believe the order should be for commuter trains. The Cannon Street train
crash report said that the 30-year-old rolling stock used on the Cannon
Street line should be replaced quickly for safety reasons. If, however,
British Rail opts for the InterCity order it should encourage GEC to buy its
body shells from ABB to ensure that the Pounds 150m is used, as intended, to
keep British rolling-stock manufacturing in business. If this does not
happen British train building will go the way of the British motorcycle
industry and we will, in future, always have to buy trains from abroad,
adding even more to our trade deficit.

FT  13 APR 93 / Letter: Credit should be given for Bolivia's economic
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SAMUEL DORIA MEDINA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers, and I think Bolivia, deserve better than Chris
Philipsborn's article 'Architect of austerity ahead in Bolivian poll' (March
9).
We are shortly to hold our four-yearly presidential and congressional
elections and you may be right in suggesting that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada
will be first past the post. He may, although I very much doubt it, become
president for a four-year term in the run-off. But what he, much less you,
can not claim is that he is responsible for the crackling economy which the
incoming president will receive from the hands of the Jaime Paz Zamora
government, of which I am the chief economic minister.
Over the past 12 months inflation in Bolivia has been cut to just 8 per cent
(much better than in Chile or Mexico). That is two and a half times better
than when Mr Sanchez de Lozada left office. Growth was 3.8 per cent in 1992
and we are heading for 5 per cent this year. The average annual growth
during the Paz Zamora government has been 3.5 per cent, 10 times greater
than the 0.35 per cent growth bequeathed to us by the previous government.
Investors are voting with their cheque-books. Today there are more than four
times the volume of dollar bank deposits than there were when the last
government left office. Foreign currency deposits in the commercial banks
were close to zero and in any case less than Dollars 500m. Today they are
close to Dollars 1.7bn.
This, and a lot more of the same, is not the result of Mr Sanchez de
Lozada's policies. We all wish economic growth was merely a question of
setting the right policy. But the reality is that the economic successes of
the Jaime Paz Zamora government have been brought about by hard-headed
cost-cutting and control on a daily, cash basis by a tough group of
politicians and civil servants, many of whom have degrees from the same
schools as the people who run Washington and London.
Your reporter talks of 'botched' privatisations. What on earth can he be
talking about? Leaving aside a score of companies that have been privatised,
some with the help of accountants Price Waterhouse, we have just shut down
the massive Banco del Estado and virtually closed Comibol, the old state
mining company, which under Mr Sanchez de Lozada was beginning to be
reorganised. Today, the workforce is down to just 10 per cent of the
original 25,000.
The real story in Bolivia concerns a rising generation of young politicians,
bankers and businessmen who are running the country according to the rules
of a 'parliamentary democracy', in the words of Professor Jeffrey Sachs of
Harvard. This group, which includes President Jaime Paz Zamora as well as Mr
Sanchez de Lozada, is unified only by its desire to establish a free market
in Bolivia.
My party wants to take this further and search for ways to relate the market
to social justice. We are concerned that growth and inflation figures do not
reflect that two-thirds of our population is poorly educated, malnourished,
and living close to the poverty line.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pop group Madness (1977-85) spawned a clutch of unusual and very British
dance songs. Now, in these retrospective times, the Theatre Royal Stratford
East has produced a show ingeniously based on their songs. It is a comedy
revue about homelessness, written by Alan Gilbey.
While the subject is strong and the performances gutsy, the plot is weak. It
follows the fortunes of two homeless people: Squirrel, 'the nuttiest boy in
town' and Stoker, a post-gothic woman selling 'The Big Issue' outside Camden
Town Underground. They decide to house the homeless in the Ideal Home
Exhibition, where they find a homeless wine salesman camping out at his
Gewurztraminer stand, but the party ends when the police arrive. There is
even a Strangeways rooftop retrospective.
The levity of the music balances the gravity of the message, not always
clear, about the need for concerted collective action to help the homeless.
Anyone who has worked in a shelter in the UK or US will know that the
homeless do not arrive there by choice, and that they are different in
degree rather than kind from those with homes and jobs. Gilbey's succeeds in
giving each nameless face a personal story, making the matter personal.
Madness's songs, particularly the Grammy-winner 'Our House', shape the
action and provide a light, accessible medium for comments and statistics
about community care and the young homeless 'in a world that trips you up
and blames you for falling.'
However, the jokes have an edge. One beggar pleads, 'I'm in community care,
and you are that community'; another delivers a four-minute guide to
sleeping rough, constantly interrupted by TV documentary teams; and there is
a vicious fashion show, all sleeping-bags and cardboard, in the Ideal Home
Exhibition.
Jeff Teare's direction keeps the action flowing through Jenny Tiramani's
excellent Camden Tube and Ideal Home set, but the show still needs to be
cut. The principals, Paul Kissaun as Squirrel and Sophie Lawrence as Stoker,
give a fizzy, energetic performance; around them, Alan Cowan and Adam Price
are particularly versatile in other parts.

FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: The Return of the Prodigal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best theatrical revival in London is not Oscar Wilde's The Importance of
Being Earnest, admirable though it is; it is The Return of the Prodigal by
St John Hankin at the Orange Tree in Richmond and comes from a slightly
later date.
St John Emile Clavering Hankin, to give him his full name, was born in
Southampton in 1869 to a family that was plainly not badly off. He was well
educated: Malvern and Merton College, Oxford. As a journalist, he had a
spell on the Indian Daily News, then wrote theatre criticism for The Times.
He committed suicide, much in the manner of Virginia Woolf, at the age of
39, possibly in the belief that his own plays were not adequately
appreciated. In the meantime, he had completed seven of them, of which The
Return of the Prodigal was the second.
It was first produced at the Royal Court, directed by Harley Granville
Barker, in 1905. There was a revival with Sir John Gielgud in 1948, though
not much is remembered of it. The new production at Richmond, directed by
Peter Leslie Wild, should go a long way to making amends to a writer who has
been unjustly neglected.
Like Granville Barker at his best, Hankin wrote adult plays for adult
people. They are literate: they are articulate; there are no concessions to
emming and erring, still less to effing.
At the end of the play, you have been through an intelligent discussion of
the issues of the day, whether the role of women, the limits to charity, the
rise of Germany and America or the nature of the Conservative Party. Unlike
Shaw, Hankin did not invent characters merely to spout views: some of his
characters, such as Amanda Royle's Violet in The Return of the Prodigal,
have genuine feeling.
The influence of Oscar Wilde is there: how could it not be, the periods
being so close? Hankin, however, is more interested in society as a whole
than the narrow definition of the term.
Eustace, the key figure in The Prodigal and the part once played by Gielgud,
is an amiable drop-out. He has been given Pounds 1,000 by his father to go
to Australia, and lost it in a mixture of sheep-farming and gold-mining.
(The same sort of people, he observes, make money in Australia as make money
in England.)
Eustace returns like the prodigal in the biblical story, to be welcomed by
his mother and sister if less so by his father, who is standing for
parliament, and his brother who is helping to run the family mill.
In the end the father is persuaded to give him an allowance to live in
London and stay out of the way, but there is no suggestion in Hankin's
writing that Eustace is especially culpable - that's just the way he is, no
good at making money yet lucky enough to have a rich family to fall back on,
much in the way that a progressive society provides for the poor.
The word used for drop-out is loafer. 'I disapprove of loafing on
principle,' says the father (Frank Moorey). 'There's far too much of it in
England today. That's where the Germans are ahead of us'. You may have heard
that sort of language before, in more recent times.
Yet where Hankin scores again is that he does not seem particularly to
condemn the father either: he records life in a well-off family, where the
women are better educated than the men but have less to do, and some of the
problems are genuine dilemmas, especially in a society trying to be liberal.
Meanwhile, Hankin takes a wonderful satirical swipe at both the the local
doctor and the local clergyman. There is much more besides.
Timothy Watson plays Eustace; the company as a whole is outstandingly good.
This is a production that anyone who likes theatre must make an effort to
see.

FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: Ivan Moravec - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Krystian Zimerman's crystalline Debussy at the Barbican five days
earlier still a sparkling memory, Ivan Moravec gave a reminder to his
audience at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday of how an older generation of
pianists used to construe that composer. Moravec divided his recital between
Debussy and Chopin, and was only marginally more convincing in the latter;
in two Ballades and the Barcarolle his secure technique and confidence at
least gave the music a semblance of commitment.
Which is not to suggest that his view of Chopin was in itself interesting or
contained interpretative points or insights to distinguish it from any other
highly competent performance. There seemed something consistently
complacent, almost school-masterly, about Moravec's playing, a
take-it-or-leave-it disdain which suggested interpretations fixed in stone,
proof against the circumstances of any particular occasion. Even the charges
through the climactic sections of the A flat and G minor Ballades hardly
generated any excitement; they were armour-clad assaults on the figuration
that left all the dramatic tensions to take care of themselves.
There is no Debussy work that could thrive with such treatment. Within 20
bars the opening movement of Children's Corner had been fussed by
unnecessary ritardandi applied, it appeared, by rote; 'Jimbo's Lullaby' was
never allowed to linger, while 'Golliwog's Cakewalk' stayed tight-lipped to
the end. Without a feeling for line and colour the Suite Bergamasque can be
made very boring indeed, and Pour le Piano is turned into an unremitting
exercise.
In all three works Moravec's dynamic range was confined between mezzo forte
and fortissimo, and his tone colour kept to Steinway monochrome. If other
interpreters have shown how Debussy's piano music needs to be carefully
coloured and articulated to reveal its full glory, Moravec offered a
salutary reminder of how a broader brush can effortlessly sweep away all
that subtlety and musical integrity.

<TEXT>
Intensity is one of the great qualities the performing arts can demonstrate
 -but it is only great when allied with spontaneity. Think of bad
silent-movie acting, where actors roll their eyes, clutch their hair, and
pose furiously to make an 'intense' - but contrived - effect. Well, it is
easy for us to think complacently that such acting belongs in the past. Not
so, however. Contrived intensity in modern theatre is alive and kicking, and
whole styles have been based upon it.
LOVE, a 90-minute piece made by Nigel Charnock for Volcano Theatre Company,
is a good (bad) example. The three actors are endlessly intense; and yes,
among other things, they clutch their hair, chew the furniture and pose
furiously. This is a vile style - but it passes as something new because the
three performers also grope and French-kiss one another, stuff hands down
each other's underwear, sit in the laps of certain audience members, and
recite numerous Shakespeare sonnets. Oh yes, and several Shirley Bassey
songs are played too.
Time and again, the three players urge themselves into various forms of
hysterical behaviour. They hurl themselves at each other, throw each other
about, drop each other; and this occurs in cyclical patterns that accelerate
so as to suggest the crescendo of hysteria. The woman (Fern Smith)
repeatedly lets her hair fall over her face, only to sweep it back. (Among
the many current dance-theatre cliches used in LOVE, this must be the
worst.) Frenetic sex scenes abound, though remarkably unappealing.
LOVE means to reflect the set-up that produced Shakespeare's sonnets. It has
its own dark lady, one cuter and younger man, and another man more gaunt and
sensitive. This, however, should not detain us. LOVE tells you no more about
the erotic nexus within Shakespeare's sonnets that any intelligent
adolescent could glean from them. The performers yell the words and ignore
the scansion.
Nigel Charnock is well known as a performer with DV8 Physical Theatre, and
LOVE exemplifies all the trashy excesses of DV8 style without any of DV8's
occasional virtues (wit, craftsmanship, ambiguity). Every situation plunges
rapidly off the deep end. Everybody squeezes each other's pecs, licks
waists, feels groins, and there is kissing, jumping, catching and bashing
galore. More than once, the woman kisses and beats her man. Alternate lines
of 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day' are yelled by man and woman as
they wrestle each other violently around the floor.
Never mind emotion recollected in tranquillity - as far as LOVE is
concerned, poetry is emotion simulated in hysteria.
At the Riverside Studios, London W6, until April 17

Two unusually tempting offers, and both at 9.00. Channel 4's excellent
catch-all culture series Without Walls shows the first of three programmes
on technological advances this century and asks the old Frankenstein
question: will mankind's ingenuity produce technology to serve our interests
or will it take over the world. Artificial intelligence, robotics and
plastic surgery all come into the picture. The movie Broadcast News,
receiving its first screening on terrestrial television (9.00 ITV), is
wickedly accurate and the funniest Hollywood film about television. It
involves romance and has a 'Thirty-something' flavour, but it is the
authentic and hilarious newsroom scenes which are so rewarding. Assignment
(7.45 BBC2) reports on the astounding political situation in Italy where
scores of politicians, civil servants and businessmen are now in prison. As
they await investigation for corruption the horrors of prison life are
inducing many to sing like canaries, producing a virtuous circle of
revelation and further incrimination.

FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: Classical disappointment - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was that great English architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, who wrote, 'You
cannot copy: you find if you do you are caught, a mess remains. It means
hard labour, hard thinking, over every line in all three dimensions and in
every joint; and no stone can be allowed to slide. You cannot play
originality with the Orders. They have to be so well digested that there is
nothing but essence left. When right they are curiously lovely - unalterable
as plant forms . . . The perfection of the Order is far nearer nature than
anything produced on impulse or accident-wise.'
Lutyens was writing about his knowledge and love of the classical language.
He understood it so well, and his own buildings demonstrate that his
knowledge of classicism was so profound, that he could defy the rules with
originality and wit.
A classical building is one whose decorative language is derived from the
architectural vocabulary of the ancient world. The vocabulary is developed
to embrace the five orders of columns and a series of standard ways of
combining mouldings, door and window openings and pediments and porticoes.
But a successful classical building is not simply a selection of these
elements mixed up to any old recipe. Success in classical archi-tecture
depends upon an understanding of how to achieve a harmony of the different
parts. Harmony is guaranteed by an understanding of proportion.
A lot of pretentious nonsense has been written about the nature of
proportion. It is enough to say that its purpose is to create harmony
throughout a structure. This is achieved either by a consistent use of one
of the orders or by the application of a system of dimensions that regularly
repeats basic ratios. The important thing to remember about proportion is
that it depends upon a rigorous and thorough application of simple rules
throughout a building. It is that logic that creates elegance. It is that
discipline that creates architecture.
Almost opposite the London office of this newspaper, on the north bank of
the Thames by Southwark Bridge, is a huge new office building that has
serious pretensions to be regarded as a classical building. Vintners Place
is the building's name and the architects are The Whinney Mackay-Lewis
Partnership working for the developers Wates City of London Properties plc
and Sumitomo Corporation in conjunction with the Vintners' Company. The site
is a large one incorporating the Vintners' Hall and the listed facades of an
Edwardian building.
It called for a grand gesture and the architect has certainly made a bold
effort with a giant portico on the river front - an attempt to raise
Vintners Place above the level of the grim and mediocre riverside buildings
that have been built since the war. A stone- fronted building was clearly
called for to be at home alongside the listed facades.
As the Prince of Wales said when he opened the building recently, 'it is
very difficult, I think, to find a way to combine elements of the classical
approach to architecture with contemporary requirements for office space.'
While the prince went on to admire the architect's efforts, he was right to
point out the difficulties any architect would face. The difficulty lies in
using only elements. A classical building has to have a classical quality
throughout. This new building is really only classical in part.
Some of the parts are very rich and colourful. Unfortunately the public
won't very often see the marble halls and stairs and galleria that run from
Upper Thames Street to the river - ingeniously dealing with the changes of
level and making some grand spaces on the way.
The colourful marble floors (based upon the floor of Saint Peter's in Rome
no less) are examples of excellent marble craftsmanship. I enjoyed too the
invented column capital that uses the swan symbol of the Vintners. There is
a rather untypical example of the mural painting of Ricardo Cinalli on the
circular ceiling of the hallway telling the story of Leda and the swan. His
work is usually much more muscular and sexier . . .
The architect has been brave in attempting a copy of the great Scala Regia
in the Vatican (designed by Bernini) to take visitors gradually to his
atrium. In the Vatican Bernini was dealing with light as well as the
gradient - and he was reminding us, in the concentration of his columns, of
the majesty of his exterior colonnade in Saint Peter's Square. Why was I
moved to tears when I first climbed Bernini's stair and left untouched by
this version? The answer is that Bernini understood weight and light and
intercolumniation.
The Romans and all the great classical architects attached a great deal of
importance to the spacing of columns. The width of the gaps between columns
is measured by column diameters. This gives each different classical
building a distinctive and particular tempo. The intercolumniation of the
great big portico on the Thames front of this building does not have the
right rhythm for its scale. Perhaps economy prevented the widening of the
portico and the addition of more columns in scale and proportion to the
whole building? It must, I assume, have been economy that prevented the
regular addition of mouldings and frames to all the windows. And there is
something odd about the windows because of the almost total absence of
glazing bars.
I know that enormous effort goes into a building like this; there is no
doubt that it is an ingenious and complex achievement. But if you build a
classical building it has to obey the rules, and only intense knowledge of
those rules allows you to try and fit the Vatican into a modern office
block. I would have though that Venice rather than Rome should have been the
source of this building on the river - or perhaps Vicenza, where the Palazzo
Chiericati would have made a marvellous model. From the outside this
building does enhance the river, but it is no masterpiece, and to any eye
trained to look at classical buildings its comprehension of the integrity of
the classical language is frankly disappointing.

FT  13 APR 93 / People: Partnership Sourcing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Derek Hornby, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board and the
former chairman of Rank Xerox, has taken over as chairman of Partnership
Sourcing, the three-year-old joint venture between the CBI and DTI which has
just received another two years of funding from the DTI. Sir Derek takes
over from Lord Joseph; the latter spawned the idea as the result of a trip
to Japan but stood down last summer because he now spends more time in
America.
Kenneth Cherrett, director, moves up to become director general - the
position Sir Derek previously occupied. Cherrett, 50, a secondee from the
TSB where he had been director of corporate relations, has now taken early
retirement from the bank. Neill Irwin, on secondment from ICL, becomes
director.
The group is shortly expecting the results of its 1993 survey on partnership
sourcing. Last year showed a heightened awareness of this philosophy of
encouraging closer co-operation between companies and their suppliers in the
name of greater efficiency. Among companies surveyed, 90 per cent had heard
of the concept, compared with 70 per cent 12 months before, though only 48
per cent (up from 45 per cent) of purchasers and 37 per cent of suppliers
(34 per cent) had adopted a scheme.

Urals

<TEXT>
CONDER PROJECTS, the specialist design and build operation of the Miller
Group, has just won the USDollars 28m (Pounds 18.5m) contract to design,
construct and equip a five-storey oncology clinic with 12 operating theatres
in Yekaterinburg in the Urals.
Linked to an oncology hospital currently under construction, the building
will also include anaesthetic and recovery rooms, a sterilisation plant,
laboratories and teaching facilities.
This is part of a major social programme aimed at improving Russian
healthcare standards, and it will become the centre for the treatment of
cancer and related illnesses in the Sverdlovsk region. Work is expected to
start on site in mid-1993.
This is the first project to be carried out as a result of Conder Projects'
associate membership of the British Healthcare Consortium.

FT  13 APR 93 / People: SG Warburg's finance director off to Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is unusual for a London merchant bank to post one of its most senior men
to Tokyo at the relatively mature age of 55, and even more unusual when the
person in question is the group's finance director.
However, SG Warburg stresses that Michael Gore's appointment as executive
head of the Asia Pacific region reflects an upgrading of the importance of
the area in the group's affairs, rather than a response to problems
associated with undisclosed losses in Japan.
Warburg, in common with several foreign brokers and investment banks, has
found it difficult to make money in Japanese equities, but says that its
Tokyo business has been doing much better over the past few months. Close to
a fifth of the group's 5,200 staff are located in the region.
Gore (right), who joined Warburg in 1964 and is one of the group's three
vice-chairmen, has had board responsibility for the group's Asia Pacific
strategy area for the past nine months. After the group's well publicised
problems in Japan last year, it was reported that he intended to spend three
months a year in Tokyo.
Warburg's decision to put Gore's Tokyo posting on a more permanent footing
means that he has had to give up being group finance director - a job he has
held since 1986. The job will now be shared between Simon Leathes, 45,
Warburg's chief financial officer, and John Trueman, 50, chairman of the
group risk committee. They will both report to the chief executive.
Gore is not the only Tokyo-bound merchant banker, however. Lord Trenchard,
42 (far right), president of Kleinwort Benson International, who has been
named as KB's senior representative in Japan, is more than a dozen years
younger and is an old Japan hand. He was the firm's chief representative in
Japan between 1980 and 1985. He replaces Gregory Shenkman, 42, who is being
seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry to assist with export
promotion before returning to KB in mid-1994.

FT  13 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Managing highways for local
authority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A multi-million pound contract has been signed by Berkshire County Council
and engineering consultants BABTIE GROUP who took over the council's
highways and planning services on April 1.
The four-year contract is worth more than Pounds 30m in fees and will see
the consultants handling projects worth Pounds 140m over the same period.
The contract is believed to be the largest ever awarded by a local authority
and makes Berkshire the first council to externalise its highways and
planning services.
It has also resulted in a saving to the county council of Pounds 1.3m in
1993/94 and this figure is expected to increase in subsequent years.
Babtie will take 309 of the department's 383 permanent and temporary staff
and about 20 will continue to be employed by the county council on the
'clientside' to manage the contract.
Fourteen staff will be ending temporary contracts, while a further 26 are
taking voluntary redundancy leaving the council with 14 compulsory
redundancies.

FT  13 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Calling in the experts -
How do you know when the time has come to hire a finance director?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Tony Cotton's bank manager who suggested the time had come for him to
employ a full-time finance director. Cotton's business, Logistic Support
Consultants, had grown so quickly that its Pounds 200,000 overdraft was
starting to creak under the strain and the company was in need of an
injection of outside equity.
LSC provides advice, training and software services to help companies
minimise the running costs of plant, vehicle fleets and computers. Based in
Tamworth, Staffordshire, it expects to double sales to Pounds 2m this year
and increase staff numbers by half to 45.
Fearful that an advertisement would produce too many replies to be
manageable, Cotton asked his company's accountant if he could recommend
anyone. The result was that Alex Norton, finance director with an investment
company until it was taken over, is due to join LSC as finance director
designate in a week's time.
'We realise now we should have appointed a finance director two years ago,'
says Cotton. 'We were considering bringing in an outside investor and our
cashflow was under pressure. We were being bombarded with advice. The bank
said one thing, our accountant said something else and our potential
investors something else again. We couldn't see the wood for the trees.'
LSC is not alone in this experience. It is common for companies,
particularly those set up by entrepreneurs without financial expertise, to
find their accounting systems under pressure as business expands. 'Finance
is a crucial function in today's climate,' says John Woodcock, joint
managing director of Robert Half, a financial recruitment agency. 'A company
must have its hands on the purse-strings.'
In the early stages businesses often rely on their auditors to provide
financial advice but they may not be available when they are needed and will
not have the same commitment. It can also prove expensive to use an outside
accountant for regular financial advice once the business starts to grow.
But this does not automatically mean that a small or medium-sized business
requires someone with the title, salary and perks of a finance director. 'We
see people take on a finance director when what they really need is a
financial controller,' comments Chris Maidment, a partner at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.
It may be tempting to have someone with an impressive set of initials after
their name but too senior a figure may not be prepared to get down to the
details required to manage the finances of a small business. 'Someone who
has been high up in a professional firm may not want to roll up his
shirt-sleeves,' says Maidment.
The precise title a company gives to its financial specialist will depend on
the style of the business, says David Wise, a consultant who has been signed
up by the Institute of Directors to run its first course for would-be
finance directors. 'It is not important if he is formally on the board as
long as he is close to the managing director.'
It often makes sense to employ a fully qualified accountant but on a
part-time basis. Jo Frost has worked for a number of small businesses -
typically with sales of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m and a dozen employees - on a
part-time basis and has just started working for a small marketing company
one day a week.
Frost, who trained and worked for two of the big accountancy firms before
going freelance, has the job of taking the company's raw management accounts
and presenting them in a form suitable for the annual audit. 'A qualified
accountant can also help with tax questions and budgets,' she says.
Some companies are tempted to use non-executive directors with a financial
background to back up a weak executive finance director but this is not a
good idea, suggests Bruce Rhodes, a director of Pro-Ned, which recruits
non-executive directors for companies.
'This is not the role of a non-executive director,' comments Rhodes. 'He
should be able to give general guidance on issues such as fund raising,
corporate finance and treasury issues but he should not be used for
operational activities.'
The stage at which a company requires a full-time, professionally qualified
finance director (there is no legal requirement for a finance director to
have an accountancy qualification) depends on its size and on the complexity
of its financial affairs. Some companies will require a finance director
when turnover reaches Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m but others go to Pounds 7m-Pounds
8m before it becomes necessary, says Jeff Grant, joint managing director at
Robert Half.
Jerry Brand, founder and managing director of Russell &amp; Brand, a
five-year-old contract catering company with sales of Pounds 15m, says he
realised he needed good accounting controls from an early stage to handle
the large amounts of cash coming in daily from his company's canteens and
restaurants.
Brand took on a retired accountant for one day a week to manage his cash
books. As the company and the job expanded, the accountant became full-time
finance director but two years ago decided for himself that a younger man
was needed. The accountant stayed on as company secretary but Brand
advertised for a new finance director.
He chose Simon Newth from the more than 20 people who replied to the
advertisement 'because he was not just a figures man. He was interested in
the business and in going out and seeing clients'. Another well-qualified
applicant had computer skills and Russell &amp; Brand's financial systems did
need upgrading at that time, but Brand opted for Newth's more commercial
orientation.
Defining precisely what you want the finance director to do should be the
first step. 'If a small company has never had a finance director before it
may well have a theoretical rather than a practical idea of what he should
do,' says Chris Maidment.
'The role of the finance director can vary,' comments Jeff Grout. 'Companies
should think about what they are looking for. Do they need someone to handle
relations with the bank, to improve costing procedure or to deal with the
computer system? The management team must prepare a list of what they want
and then set priorities.'
While some managing directors, like Brand, welcome a finance director who
becomes involved in broader business development issues, there is a danger
that an enthusiastic finance director can become too involved.
'Finance directors who come straight from a professional accountancy firm
often get too wrapped up in marketing or business development issues,' says
Chris Maidment. 'They should be there to remind the managing director of the
financial constraints.'
The finance director is frequently the first senior appointment made by a
growing business since many founders have technical and marketing skills.
Personal recommendation or experience of having worked with someone is a
good starting point and companies often do recruit accountants who have
worked for them as auditors or provided financial advice. Press
advertisements can also be effective though sometimes produce large numbers
of responses which need to be sifted.
Many appointments are handled through executive recruitment agencies, which
advertise for and help select applicants, and executive search consultancies
or headhunters which do not advertise but use personal contacts to find
people. Recruitment agencies will typically charge 25 per cent of the salary
involved while headhunters will charge 33 per cent.
With unemployment at very high levels in the accountancy sector, now is a
good time to recruit a finance director. Salary rates have come down and a
job which would have required a salary of Pounds 40,000-Pounds 45,000 plus
car and benefits two years ago would now only rate Pounds 30,000-Pounds
35,000, calculates David Taylor, a freelance consultant who helps venture
capitalists find finance directors for the companies they back.
'A lot of people are looking for jobs at the moment,' says Maidment. 'There
is an oversupply of people at this level and a company can get a wealth of
experience for a very competitive salary.'

FT  13 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Closer UK/US links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has launched a programme to help medium-sized British
companies establish alliances with similar US companies.
The three-year pilot programme is intended to help companies, which are
already exporting to the US, establish closer links by means of joint
product development, franchising, collaborative marketing and licensing
agreements.
The Strategic Alliance Service forms part of a broader Department of Trade
and Industry programme, called North America Now, which was launched last
month. The service* will be managed by accountants Price Waterhouse.
The new initiative is aimed at companies with turnover of between Pounds 5m
and Pounds 50m and employing between 50 and 500 people. Both independent
companies and subsidiaries of larger groups are eligible.
The DTI estimates that up to 1,500 UK companies will meet its criteria,
although it expects to sign up only 50 for the programme each year. Of these
it expects between 10 and 15 will find partners. These targets are modest,
the DTI acknowledges, but if successful the programme could be extended to
other markets.
Partnerships represent a less risky way into the US market than acquisitions
or setting up from scratch and tie up less capital. The economic climate and
the dollar/sterling exchange rates are also favourable, the DTI says.
The DTI will spend Pounds 185,000 a year on the programme while the cost to
companies which pass through all stages of the scheme and find a partner
will be Pounds 14,000 plus travel and other expenses.
Profiles of UK companies which meet the programme's criteria and which can
show they are committed to establishing US links will be matched with US
counterparts through Price Waterhouse's network of US offices.
UK companies will be provided with a shortlist of possible US partners and
meetings will be arranged. From then on it is up to the two companies to
negotiate a deal, the DTI says.

FT  13 APR 93 / Engineering study dents theory of job flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL innovation and accelerating international competitive pressures
have not brought greater job flexibility and de-skilling to Britain's
engineering industry over the past 10 years, a survey published by Lancaster
University's engineering industry research group shows.
This contradicts the fashionable theory of the 'flexible' company with a
small core of full-time workers and an increasingly peripheral workforce
doing contracted-out work.
The broad-based survey of 148 engineering establishments, with half
employing fewer than 100 workers, found that there had been no increase in
the use of part-time employment in production.
This was not even the case in cleaning and catering. The survey argues that
instead of contracting more and more work, the engineering industry 'has
increasingly come to be characterised by technologically sophisticated,
increasingly skilled, full-time employment patterns during the last decade'.
It found that there was increased training of workers to cover other jobs,
more individualised forms of pay and increased shift work. Nearly three
quarters of the companies covered also introduced important technological
changes in their production processes.
The author, Mr Roger Pen, argues that the dominant trend in British
engineering has been 'an increasing reliance' on full-time workers.
'In British engineering plants during the 1980s the core workforce became
more and more the entire workforce,' he says.
The survey also found that 65.8 per cent of the sample had recognised unions
bargaining collectively. Half the unionised plants covered white-collar as
well as manual workers.
About 60 per cent of engineering plants reported no changes in the level of
union influence over either pay or work organisation.
Just more than half the plants had introduced new forms of worker
involvement during the 1980s, such as works councils, team briefings and
other forms of open communication. Profit sharing was virtually
non-existent, however, and quality circles were rare.

FT  13 APR 93 / Three arrested at Timex protest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE people were arrested yesterday in violent scenes outside the Timex
company's Dundee plant where workers have been campaigning for 11 weeks to
win back their jobs.
Outside the plant an estimated 1,000 supporters joined the 340 workers who
were dismissed by Timex for refusing to accept a package of changes to pay,
benefits and working practices. Later 6,000 people attended a solidarity
rally near the plant organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress.
Mr Willie Lesslie, the deputy convenor at Timex, told the meeting that the
company faced two choices - a negotiated settlement or the permanent
shutdown of the plant.
The company has hired a new workforce which is bussed into the plant every
day under police protection.
The company insists that there is no issue any more because the strikers are
no longer employed by Timex and have been replaced. It says that the
production of circuit boards for televisions is continuing.

FT  13 APR 93 / BR in talks to avert strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER TALKS are to be held today between British Rail and the two main
rail unions in a final attempt to avert Friday's planned 24-hour stoppage,
Robert Taylor writes.
BR management worked over the holiday weekend to try to convince the unions
not to proceed with their planned disruption. The two sides, however, appear
far apart.
The RMT, the main rail union, continues to insist that it needs a guarantee
from BR of no future compulsory redundancies and an end to contracting-out
of work.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, is demanding that existing national
agreements covering the deployment of its members should not be changed.
Until now BR has tried to offer the unions forms of words that would
convince them that every effort would be made to avoid any compulsory
redundancies as the railway network prepared for privatisation, due to start
next year. But BR management failed on Friday to make any breakthrough with
the unions.
Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, has emphasised that the industry cannot afford
any more one-day strikes. The 24-hour stoppage by the RMT on April 2 cost BR
Pounds 10m gross.

FT  13 APR 93 / 700 Names spark new Lloyd's legal battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTECTIVE WRITS will be issued today by more than 700 Lloyd's Names on
Wellington syndicates 406 and 448, launching fresh legal action at the
insurance market.
The Names, who include the Duchess of Argyll and the actress Ms Susan
Hampshire, are among a group of more than 4,000 who face heavy losses,
mainly from US asbestosis and pollution awards.
The development comes as prospects for an out-of-court settlement to legal
actions at Lloyd's are receding. Names, whose assets support underwriting at
the market, are hoping that a settlement will form part of a business plan
which the market's leaders expect to publish later this month.
The new case centres on reinsurance contracts bought by the Wellington
syndicates in 1981 and 1982. These were designed to provide unlimited
protection against US liability business underwritten in the 1960s and
1970s.
The Names allege, however, that the contracts were not properly negotiated,
allowing reinsurers to buy them back. Wellington Names were therefore
unprotected against claims that have subsequently emerged.
The reinsurer of both contracts was Outhwaite syndicate 317, itself the
target of successful legal action by another group of Names last year.
Willis Faber, the syndicates' former managers, 46 members' agencies and
Ernst &amp; Whinney, the syndicates' auditors, are named in the writs.
The Wellington losses are not among the biggest at the market but Names are
worried because claims are continuing to come in from insurance policies
written as long ago as the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1989, 3,698 members of 448 lost Pounds 48.3m (compared to stamp capacity
or capital of Pounds 128.7m), but the syndicate's accounts for that year
were left open because of the uncertainty.
In the same year syndicate 406's 3,035 Names lost Pounds 30.4m (compared to
stamp capacity of Pounds 109.6m).
Yesterday Mr David Tiplady, solicitor with DJ Freeman, which is issuing the
writs, said: 'It seems to me that the only way Names can be succoured is
through successful legal action.
'Names should not expect to be rescued by Lloyd's,' he added, reflecting
increasing scepticism about the prospects of an out-of-court settlement.
Failure to reach an out-of-court settlement is likely to lead to renewed
conflict at the market with loss-making Names. 'We do not believe the
business plan will have any value if it does not involve settling the
litigation,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's
Names Association Working Party, an umbrella group which links groups of
aggrieved Names. Mr Stockwell said his group has examined possible legal
action against the Corporation of Lloyd's for failing to regulate the
market.

FT  13 APR 93 / Treasury firm on petroleum tax proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY was last night taking a hard line over its controversial
Petroleum Revenue Tax reform proposals ahead of a series of meetings between
ministers and oil industry leaders.
Although political pressure for a government climbdown was mounting, senior
Treasury figures said the industry should not expect any changes to its
proposals.
The comments followed suggestions that the government might be prepared to
go some way towards addressing the industry's concerns by fine-tuning the
transition arrangements, particularly to meet some of the objections over
the retrospective nature of the changes.
The oil industry is finding it difficult to present a united front against
the changes because there are some companies that stand to gain
substantially in terms of increased cashflow.
Nevertheless, the industry seems united over one issue - the retrospective
nature of the tax changes. Companies say they applied to the Department of
Trade and Industry for licences to explore in the North Sea on the
understanding that the rules would not change. As part of the application
process they committed themselves to drill a certain number of wells. Some
suggest that they could not fulfil these obligations without tax relief.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said that if companies had already
entered into contracts for drilling wells they could still apply for tax
relief. But oil companies want that undertaking to cover 'firm commitments'
they have made to drill wells.
The Treasury yesterday dismissed these arguments and suggested there was no
legal requirement for oil companies to stick to exploration targets agreed
with the DTI.
The new rules will lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per
cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also
remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea, a
change that will hit many of the small independent companies hard.
The industry suggests that the changes will quadruple the cost of exploring
in the North Sea. Oil operators are warning that they will have to scale
down exploration severely if the changes go ahead. A survey found that 85
per cent of oil companies expected job losses to result from the changes.

FT  13 APR 93 / Electrical goods set for sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER SPENDING on electrical goods will grow by almost a quarter in the
next three years, twice the rate of retail sales as a whole, a report
published today says.
The report, by Verdict Research, says leading electrical retailers are in
excellent shape and are producing remarkably good figures, given the dire
trading climate.
Total sales in the electrical market have grown by just 10 per cent over the
past four years, less than half the rate of growth achieved by all
retailers.
The poor trading conditions - sales in the Pounds 9.5bn electrical market
were more or less static last year - have prompted widespread discounting of
goods but redundancies and company rationalisations have helped to protect
profitability, the report says.
Dixons Group, the market leader, has raised its UK market share by 3 per
cent in the past two years, in spite of difficulties with its US operation.
Profits in the audio sector are likely to be boosted by sales of the new
digital compact cassettes and mini-discs, given a sustained upturn in the
economy, the report says.
It claims the biggest threat to the market leaders is posed by the regional
electricity companies. Mergers and acquisitions have created a smaller
number of regional companies with almost 10 per cent of the market.
The report does not expect a clear upturn in demand to emerge until the last
quarter of this year.

FT  13 APR 93 / Staff seek to capture Strangeways: Public-sector bid to run
the recently modernised Manchester prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the three years since the near destruction of Strangeways prison in
Manchester during the most serious prison riots of recent times, it has been
completely rebuilt and modernised within its Victorian red-brick shell.
Today the physical reconstruction will be followed by an equally remarkable
transformation of the management of Strangeways, when the public and private
sectors submit rival bids to run the prison.
Two private-sector companies have already been awarded contracts to manage
British prisons. But Strangeways - with accommodation for 1,150 men - is on
a bigger scale and, for the first time, the state prison service and the
private sector are bidding against each other as part of the government's
market testing of public services.
About six private-sector bids are expected. One from the Strangeways
management and staff led by Mr Robin Halward, the governor, will be pitched
against them. Mr Halward, former governor of Armley prison, Leeds, moved to
Strangeways last year to prepare the public-sector bid.
When Mr Halward's bid reaches the Home Office today it will emphasise that
it has the strong support of the Strangeways unions and staff. The Prison
Officers' Association and other prison-service unions are opposed to market
testing and private management. They decided, however, that rather than
boycott the process their strongest position was to demonstrate that the
public sector could compete and win.
Two members of the Strangeways POA committee have worked full-time on the
bid for the past six months as representatives of the unions and junior
staff.
The 400 Strangeways staff - almost all of whom experienced the 1990 riots -
are backing the bid even though they know that success would cost some of
them their jobs.
Mr Halward admitted: 'Staffing levels under our bid would be substantially
leaner than if the prison ser-vice had reopened Strange-ways in the
traditional way.'
Other concessions have been made. The POA has a reputation for traditional,
old-fashioned militancy. While Mr Halward believes the view of the prison
service as a 'dispute-ridden, industrial-relations dominated organisation'
is distorted, he has secured local POA agreement to maintain the prison's
contract with the government in the event of industrial action.
'No workforce can guarantee that there will never be a dispute of one sort
or another,' he said. 'But the bid will include a procedural agreement with
the local POA which guarantees the maintenance of standards required in the
service level agreement (the government contract) during any collective
dispute that there might be.'
The Strangeways staff bid also proposes a more devolved management structure
than in other state prisons.
Mr Halward said that historically the prison service had been 'full of the
Civil Service tradition' of concentrating on processes rather than outcomes.
'Until a few years ago work on suicide prevention in prison focused more on
being able to defend the prison service if a prisoner took his own life than
on looking at why it happened.
'We have to put judgment more to the fore by deciding what we want to
achieve and allowing managers at every level, within guidelines, to make
their own professional judgments about how to achieve it. Our bid proposes
more managerial devolution than is normal in a public prison, with managers
working out with their staff how to achieve objectives.'
Serious overcrowding, leading to prisoners being required to share cells for
most of the day, helped provoke the Strangeways riots. In the new
Strangeways men will be out of their cells for up 12 to 15 hours.
'But it is no use unlocking prisoners and then leaving them milling around
all day,' Mr Halward said.
'We have to try to get prisoners to indulge in positive activities, and
create a positive, active community in the hope that people might carry over
some of these values when they are released. Compared with other local
prisons, our bid proposes a much better programme of work, training,
education and ways of addressing offending behaviour,' he added.
The 350 prisoners who remained in Strangeways during rebuilding were
consulted when the bid was being prepared. Mr Halward believes in the need
to involve prisoners, but stressed: 'This is not going to be a democracy. We
would not be discharging our responsibility to the public if we just allowed
prisoners to do what they wanted.'
Bids to manage Strangeways will be reduced to a shortlist next month, with
the contract awarded in the summer. Staff at Strangeways would be
disappointed - and surprised - if their bid did not make the shortlist and
believe they have a real hope of winning.
Mr Halward said: 'We are convinced that the public sector bid is
commercially competitive. And one of our particular strong points is that we
have the workforce - the prison's highly experienced staff have agreed to
accept change, know what is expected of them, and are ready to deliver it.'

FT  13 APR 93 / Welsh wind farm project completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST wind farm outside the US (left) has been completed at Llandinam,
Powys. The 103 turbines will generate 31MW - enough power for 20,000 homes.
Partners in the project have released no details of the cost but it is
thought about Pounds 25m has been spent to complete the project - only 12
months since winning planning permission.
The wind farm was built jointly by Tomen, a Japanese trading house, EcoGen,
a UK company formed in 1990 to bring together a number of interests working
on commercial wind power, and SeaWest, a US company. Last month
ScottishPower announced it was also helping to finance and to operate the
wind farm.
Operation of the wind farm is covered by two NFFO (non fossil fuel
obligation) contracts by which the government requires electricity supply
companies to acquire some of their power from specified renewable sources
such as wind, water and waste products.

FT  13 APR 93 / Banks face severe losses on property: Shortfall of Pounds
8bn on loans in south-east estimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS FACE a potential shortfall of more than Pounds 8bn on loans made for
office property in London and the south-east, says a report.
Estimates by St Quintin, a firm of chartered surveyors, illustrate the
severity of the banks' property losses, which resulted from the sharp rise
in bank lending to the property sector in the late 1980s and the subsequent
collapse in commercial property val-ues.
The firm believes that the Pounds 24.6bn of loans to London and south-east
offices may be secured on property worth just Pounds 16.4bn. In the central
London office sector, the worst-hit part of the market, loans of Pounds
10.8bn may be supported by assets worth only Pounds 6.4bn.
Mr Peter Damesick, a director of St Quintin, said the banks' losses might
not, however, be as large as the gap between the value of a loan and the
underlying asset.
In some cases the loans are guaranteed by other assets. Moreover, property
values may have risen by the time a loan matures.
Mr Damesick said: 'The shortfall between asset values and outstanding debts
can be expected to narrow as currently vacant buildings are gradually let
and values generally improve over the medium term.'
The report estimates that the Pounds 37.9bn of loans extended to the entire
UK commercial property sector is secured against property that has fallen in
value from Pounds 50.5bn to Pounds 31bn during the past four years.
The value of bank-financed property in the industrial and provincial office
markets has not, in aggregate, fallen below the outstanding debt.
The report says that one result of the fall in asset values to just more
than 80 per cent of the total debt is that institutional investors have less
to fear from the apparent debt mountain than is sometimes assumed.
Moreover, the quality of much of the bank-financed property stock is not of
institutional quality.
'Institutional investors have less to fear from the apparent debt mountain
than often assumed . . . The debt 'mountain' is, in part, a mirage,' the
report says.
It warns that the banks' unwillingness to make new loans to the property
industry could hold back the sector's recovery.
'Further reductions in bank lending could inflict additional wounds on the
market and help to hold back values,' it says.
Between the beginning of 1987 and May 1991 loans to property companies rose
from just less than Pounds 10bn to Pounds 40.7bn. This figure fell to Pounds
37.9bn last November.
Including debt extended to the construction industry, the total lent to the
property sector is Pounds 53.4bn.

FT  13 APR 93 / First-timers raise hopes in Docklands: The housing market
tide may be on the turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-TIME property buyers and foreign investment are fuelling hopes of
recovery at London's Docklands.
Mr Rick Folkes, a senior negotiator with Chestertons Residential, which
sells throughout Docklands, said that sales had trebled year on year. 'In
February 1992 we sold just six homes but last month we moved 18 properties.
And that trend looks set to continue,' he said.
In 1989 the collapse of Kentish Property, a Docklands developer, marked the
beginning of a property crash which spread nationwide, claiming hundreds of
property and building companies. Now the signs suggest Docklands is ready to
join any national property revival.
Mr Iain Bell, an estate agent at Knight Frank and Rutley's Dockland office,
is meeting a smarter investor at his east London office: 'It's taken several
years for properties to reach realistic levels. The public have learned a
lot of hard lessons.
'Year on year sales are up 100 per cent, albeit from a low base, but very
few will spend over Pounds 200,000.'
Moreover, with sales concentrated at the lower end of the market - all but
four of Chestertons' February sales cost less than Pounds 85,000 - Docklands
has quietly shed the yuppie label that dogged the development in the mid to
late 1980s. The champagne lifestyle has been replaced by gritty realism.
'Our new customers are far more streetwise,' says Mr Bell. 'There's a new
criteria for buying property: can I afford my home if it's over-mortgaged or
if I lose my job? The days of taking a mortgage four times your salary are
over.'
Since the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer, in May
last year the property slump in Docklands has been compounded by uncertainty
about the Jubilee line extension. But there is renewed optimism among buyers
and sellers as the Pounds 1.7bn rail project is expected to be allowed to
proceed in the next few weeks and the Limehouse road tunnel is near
completion.
A nervous market is keeping prices low, however. An apartment at Clippers
Quay originally valued at Pounds 195,000 recently sold for Pounds 120,000.
Mr Daniel Latimer, a Hampstead retailer, spent a frustrating Easter bank
holiday scouring Docklands' bargains. He said: 'The Canary Wharf debacle did
untold damage to this area but the potential for price growth here is
enormous. In established markets like Hampstead prices just go hand-in-glove
with inflation. It's ironic most dealers here have chosen to close for the
bank holiday.'
With this cheap home market and sterling's devaluation Docklands is also
proving an attraction for foreign buyers. At the Anchorage Point Courtyard
development 43 flats were sold last month to the Bank of China. Similar
deals have been struck with Texaco, the oil company, and Morgan Stanley, the
investment bank.
Mr Tim Whitmey, associate director of Savills estate agents, which secured
the Chinese investment, is convinced foreign buyers are committed to the
long-term future of Docklands: 'There is increasing activity among
businesses moving into the Docklands. This is not simply a speculative
exercise, they are looking for cheap accommodation for their Docklands
staff.'
Hopes for the long-term recovery of property prices in Docklands will depend
on a continuing fall in the number of home repossessions and of homeowners
trapped by negative equity, and accelerating foreign investment.
'There is a shortage of quality homes coming on to the market,' Mr Bell
said. 'So I'm optimistic that if queries transfer into deals, prices will
rise. The scales will tip.'

FT  13 APR 93 / Patten warns test boycott could hit budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Patten yesterday sharpened his confrontation with teaching unions by
hinting that a boycott of school tests this summer could weaken his hand
with the Treasury in future education spending talks.
The education secretary's remarks, in an interview with the Financial Times,
underlined his determination to resist pressure from unions and some
Conservative MPs for this summer's tests to be suspended pending a review.
A concerted boycott by more than 400,000 teachers of at least some tests,
affecting up to 1.2m pupils in schools everywhere bar Scotland, has moved
closer as two teaching unions said they would ballot members over the tests
for seven, 11 and 14-year-olds, after a third withdrew from testing last
month.
The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, which
withdrew last month, is defending its boycott in a legal battle with
London's Wandsworth Council.
Mr Patten's attempt to divide moderate teachers and more radical voices
seemed to be dented by yesterday's refusal by the annual conference of the
largest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers, to discuss an
immediate strike over pay as part of a campaign with railworkers,
firefighters and miners.
Strike action by the NUT over pay is still possible next year.
The conference will today consider whether to hold a second vote on
boycotting appraisals of teachers' performance, used to determine merit pay
rises. On Saturday it voted to ballot members on boycotting national tests.
A summer of exam chaos in schools would undermine Mr Patten's political
career - he has admitted that without tests he would be less able to
withstand Treasury pressure on his department's budget.
Mr Patten did not say whether teachers' pay or school budgets could be
directly affected, but asked: 'How on earth can I argue in the forthcoming
public spending round over education expenditure without the hard
information of improving standards that testing gives?'
The education secretary's confrontational strategy suggests that he believes
many teachers, under pressure from parents, will eventually accept that the
tests, although flawed, should go ahead so that improvements can be made
next year.
Mr Patten stressed the need for testing for 14-year-olds to start this year.
'Recent evidence demonstrates the contemporary tragedy that, of last
summer's 16-year-old school leavers, up to 200,000 went on into the world
still grappling with the English language.'
The NUT yesterday voted to ban classes with more than 30 pupils, or more
than 20 for practical lessons.
The decision by the union's annual conference in Brighton means pupils face
being sent home from class as teachers refuse to take large classes, Mr
Patten was warned.

FT  13 APR 93 / FT Satellite Monitor: Over 3m homes get multi-channel TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN 3m and 3.4m homes in the UK now have access to satellite television,
four years after the launch of Sky Television, the final FT Satellite
Monitor shows.
To mark the 48th and last monthly monitor Continental Research, which
produces it, commissioned two other market research organisations, NOP and
RSGB, to conduct separate surveys of the size of the satellite market.
More than 10,000 interviews were conducted - more than 13,000 if regular
interviewing carried out by BARB, the official television audience
organisation, is included.
In 4,000 telephone interviews last month Continental found that 3.33m
households were receiving satellite television channels by dish, cable or
communal aerial systems.
The RSGB figure from 4,000 face-to-face interviews was 3.37m, and NOP came
up with a total of 2.99m based on 2,000 telephone interviews. BARB's 3,500
face-to-face interviews produced a total of 3.15m.
Continental believes that the best estimate for the total number of homes
which can receive the new channels is 3.24m. This adds up to more than 9m
individuals aged 4 or over, or 17 per cent of the UK population.
Continental has decided to stop publishing monthly changes in the number of
satellite homes because it has become more difficult to measure the figures
accurately as the market has grown.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, said yesterday: 'This
leads to unnecessary controversy about the level of satellite TV
penetration, with the monthly differences (with other market research
groups) being the result of a mix of different definitions and sampling
error.'
Continental will continue to research the number of homes receiving
satellite TV and will publish regular reports.
Its first forecast published in 1988 suggested that there would be 4m
satellite homes by the end of last year. It now believed that the 4m figure
would be reached by the end of this year and that by the 2000 homes
receiving satellite channels would have risen to 9.5m or just over 40 per
cent.
The research group has a data base of 200,000 interviews. They show that
satellite television is mainly geared to 'young large families in the mass
market'.
The market profile shows that 37 per cent of satellite homes come from the
ABC1 social groups, professional and managerial. Skilled workers, the C2Ds,
make up 56 per cent and the poorest and oldest, the Es, 7 per cent.
One in 10 adults says he or she intends to install a dish.
Meanwhile GfK, the marketing services group, today publishes its latest
estimate of the satellite dish market. GfK, which is sponsored by the ITV
Association, estimates that on February 20 a total of 2.098m satellite
dishes had been installed. This represented an increase of 39,000 since its
estimate a month ago.
The GfK survey does not include distribution of satellite channels by cable,
and Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are excluded.
The market research group has also carried out work on 'churn' - those who
get rid of their satellite dishes. Churn totalled 78,000 dishes in the first
half of last year, rising to 142,000 in the second half.
GfK believes between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of those who had BSB
Squarials did not install an Astra dish to continue receiving satellite
television.

FT  13 APR 93 / Unionist anger at SDLP meeting with Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONIST politicians reacted angrily yesterday to the weekend meeting
between Sinn Fein and Social Democratic and Labour party leaders, suggesting
that any repetition could jeopardise their participation in talks about
Northern Ireland's future.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of Mr Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist
party, told BBC Radio that no 'self-respecting' Unionist would be involved
in any talks while the SDLP was engaged in the twin process of having
discussions with provisional IRA representatives.
Mr Robinson said that Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic
SDLP, had 'given the Provisional IRA a considerable leg up at a time when
their propaganda was much needed to resolve the many problems they had
within the organisation from the Warrington bombings'.
Mr Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, met for 90 minutes in Londonderry on Saturday at the instigation of a
group of Roman Catholic clergymen.
The meeting followed abortive talks last week between IRA leaders and Irish
Senator Gordon Wilson, whose daughter was killed in the 1987 bombing at
Enniskillen.
The government, which is trying to revive the stalled roundtable talks on
the province, responded cautiously to the initiative, saying only that it
was 'a matter for Mr Hume'.
The government of the Irish Republic was slightly less guarded, saying it
did not believe Mr Hume would have 'engaged in such contacts if they did not
appear worthwhile'.
The last round of discussions between Unionists, the SDLP and the
non-sectarian Alliance party broke up without agreement in November.
In a further indication of the problems involved in getting these talks
restarted, Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, yesterday
said he had little time for them.
The way to a settlement was for bilateral talks between the government and
the main political parties separately, he argued. The government should then
come out with proposals.
Meanwhile, the IRA yesterday issued an uncompromising message that the
'violent denial of their national rights' would continue to be met with
armed resistance in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. A spokesman said the IRA
was ready to talk to the British government at any time but said that
dialogue must be without preconditions.

FT  13 APR 93 / City shudders over Mackie case: A look at the trial's
repercussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONVICTION of Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst with Edinburgh
stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White, for insider dealing has sent ripples of
concern far beyond the Scottish financial community.
Some City analysts believe the case calls into question the basis on which
they can meet company directors.
It has come at an awkward time for the government, which is seeking to
persuade the City that it has nothing to fear from moves to widen the scope
of legislation in this area.
Mr Mackie, 39, was fined Pounds 25,000 after being found guilty of using
confidential information that the Glasgow-based waste disposal company
Shanks &amp; McEwan was intending to issue a profit warning in 1991.
He was accused of 'counselling and procuring' two colleagues to sell the
company's shares for clients, saving the clients Pounds 1.39m by acting
ahead of the announcement.
The analyst denied that he was told about a formal profit warning by Mr
Peter Runciman, then chairman of Shanks, when they met 13 days before a
profit warning was issued to the Stock Exchange.
Mr Mackie said he downgraded his profit forecast for the company after being
told by the chairman that there 'would be little by way of growth in
earnings per share', but insisted he would have remained silent if he had
been made an 'insider' in the manner suggested.
People in the Edinburgh investment community are still reeling from the
guilty verdict in the case, partly because of their personal knowledge of Mr
Mackie and partly out of concern about the verdict's implications for
analysts and the investment business in general.
An investment analyst in Edinburgh who did not wish to identified said:
'Knowing Thorold Mackie I find it as inconceivable that he would have done
what he is convicted of doing.'
He added: 'An analyst would prick up his ears at the very mention of the
words 'profit warning' and Thorold would have come back from the meeting and
not told a soul. He would have gone straight to his compliance officer.
'Equally, knowing Peter Runciman I find it inconceivable that he would lie.
It looks like a misunderstanding.'
The Stock Exchange, which investigated Mr Mackie's actions, insists the case
'is no signal whatsoever. It does not change the law'.
The government is, however, currently widening the scope of legislation
against insider dealing through the Criminal Justice Bill, bringing the UK
into line with a 1989 European Community directive.
After protests from the City and industry Treasury ministers have been
forced on to the defensive, giving reassurances in the Commons that the
government has no intention to alter present market practice fundamentally.
In particular, the government has stressed that there should be no threat to
meetings with analysts, when directors answer questions and give guidance on
a company's performance and prospects.
The authorities say there is a clear distinction between such briefings and
the handing over of price-sensitive information.
The distinction can seem a fine one. Share prices routinely move after
briefings to analysts which alter stock market views of a company's
performance. Analysts act as the eyes and ears of the investment
institutions which own most of the British equity market. The market
dislikes surprises, so companies often prefer to fine-tune expectations
through analysts rather than to issue profit warnings or other information
direct to the Stock Exchange.
The Mackie case highlights the grey area between the strict letter of the
law and market practice. Both sides in the Mackie trial accepted that an
offence would indeed have occurred if Mr Mackie had acted on the basis of
advance notice of a profit warning.
The jury clearly preferred Mr Runciman's version of events. As the two men
met alone, it was difficult to establish sufficient corroboration of what
was said - a point the pending appeal is likely to focus on.
The members of the jury were told by the judge that they could take into
account the surrounding facts and circumstances - particularly Mr Mackie's
telling colleagues of the reduced profit outlook, which caused them to
advise clients to sell. What alarmed investment analysts was that Mr
Mackie's behaviour after the meeting also seemed entirely consistent with
his version of events.
A fellow Edinburgh analyst said: 'I would have to resign if I were to alter
my behaviour as a result of this verdict. If I took it literally I would
have to take a tape recorder to every meeting with a company I went to, and
agree a written summary of what was said.'
The case has caused unease partly because regulatory authorities have been
trying to give the reassurance that the new legislation will not 'start a
witch-hunt', and have been urging the City to be reassured by how few
prosecutions have been mounted in this area.
Mr Mackie is the first analyst to be charged under the 1985 Companies
Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. A total of 35 prosecutions have been
launched under the act in the past five years, producing only 12
convictions.
The same Edinburgh analyst said: 'What worries me is the fact that the
government chose to mount a prosecution in this case. That makes me feel
no-one is safe.
'It's symptomatic of a government that doesn't understand the City and is
substituting legalism for morality,' he added.

FT  13 APR 93 / Tories set for clash on Euro bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics hit back yesterday at increasingly strong government
criticism of their efforts to derail the Maastricht ratification process,
insisting they were 'hell-bent' on killing the treaty.
Mr Jim Cran, MP for Beverley, said Tory rebels were 'determined' to defeat
the Maastricht bill and remained 'very hopeful' of succeeding. But he
predicted the issue would not go away even supposing the bill was passed:
'We will still be in the Commons harrying anybody who pursues this course.'
His remarks came as the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group said the
government's attempts to force ratification through without a referendum
were having a 'devastating' effect on party morale. In a strongly worded
editorial in its Forward periodical, the group said Maastricht was dividing
the party inside and outside parliament and 'draining it of its life blood'.
The article added: 'The more the treaty that John Major initialled is
examined, the less it lives up to its hype.' It was on the basis of a 'cosy
coalition' between the leaders of the three main parties and not any
commitment by the British people that Maastricht was being 'steamrollered'
through the Commons.
The bill is due back on the floor of the Commons on Thursday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOSPITALS should be free to use private-sector funding to finance new
facilities, a prominent Tory backbench MP argues in a new paper, David Owen
writes.
Mr David Willetts, the MP for Havant and a member of the influential social
security select committee, makes the suggestion in a wide-ranging
examination of how private funding could be brought into the National Health
Service.
He urges the government to 'be clear' about what sort of ideas it is
prepared to contemplate. 'The political sensitivity surrounding private
provision is much reduced if it is manifestly supplying an extra new
facility,' he says.
Mr Willetts, a former director of studies at the Centre for Policy Studies,
the rightwing think tank, says that the 'crucial' first step in giving
private providers the opportunity to tender for new NHS developments would
be for the Department of Health to liberalise its capital control
pro-cedures.
Past proposals for bringing private finance into the NHS have failed to come
to fruition mainly because of a combination of Treasury rules, political
caution and exaggerated expectations, Mr Willetts says.
The paper was written at the request of the Social Market Foundation, an
independent think tank.

TOUGHER RULES on insider dealing should move a step nearer the statute book
tomorrow when they are due to receive their second Commons reading as part
of a wider ranging criminal justice bill, David Owen writes.
The measure, intended to align UK law with the European Community's insider
dealing directive, would define an 'insider' as anyone who has inside
information as a result of their employment, profession or duties.
The bill has triggered some disquiet in the City, and the government has
indicated it will consider amendments to its proposals where these are
deemed necessary. The areas in which changes are most likely should emerge
during the committee stage which will follow tomorrow's vote.

FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: President rejects criticism
over slowness in committing funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about the EBRD's slowness in committing funds and its lengthy
bureaucratic procedures are commonplace in east and central Europe.
But criticism is often tempered by appreciation of the way the tireless Mr
Jacques Attali, the bank's president, visits the far-flung outposts in his
chartered jet, helping to remind the world of this vast area's growing
problems.
Compared with the Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of equity investment poured
into the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland by multinational companies and
private investors in the past three years, the disbursement of Ecu126m
(Pounds 101m) is minimal.
But Mr Attali is adamant that it is 'wrong to measure the bank in terms of
(loan and equity) disbursements . . . I don't see the slow disbursement as a
problem in itself, because it's a demonstration of cautiousness. It's not a
sign of failure'.
For example, the bank has spent an estimated Ecu80m (Pounds 63m) on
'technical co-operation programmes', which are typically studies of the
appropriate methods for modernising infrastructure or of how to carry out
privatisation programmes. He also says that even if the institution had not
lent a penny since its launch, its existence would have been justified by
the recent creation of the Nuclear Safety Fund which consists of money
donated by western governments to make safe the nuclear power stations of
the former eastern bloc.
The nub of the issue is why disbursement has been so low. The problem does
not appear to be that the bank has been excessively slow in approving loans
and investments.
The bank has built up a substantial 'pipeline' of its own and joint projects
in various stages of maturity. These often focus on much-needed projects
unlikely to attract commercial attention - such as a small power plant in
war-impoverished Armenia, or privatisation in St Petersburg.
By the end of last year the board had approved projects with an EBRD
contribution of Ecu1.8bn, only slightly less than the bank had forecast for
the period. Potential borrowers have not, however, met the conditions needed
for them to draw on this finance.
There is an important intermediate stage in the status of an EBRD project
between board approval and disbursement. That is the stage when all parties
to the deal have signed the contract. Only 53 projects, involving bank
finance of Ecu1bn, had been signed by the end of February - well below the
forecast level.
Mr Attali says the main cause of the delays in signing off on the deals is
impossible for the bank to control - it is the inexperience of eastern
European countries in the process of negotiating and concluding such deals.
The bank does have control over disbursing the funds once the contract is
signed. It will distribute the funds only when it is certain that the
project is going ahead. The reason, says Mr Attali, is that he is
particularly concerned about possible fraud. 'I would prefer that we do not
take risks and find our money has been transferred to a Swiss bank.'
That precaution seems sensible in view of the widespread allegations of
fraudulent behaviour in the region. But up until now many of the investments
made by the bank's merchant-banking arm have involved foreign investors -
such as Air France, Nestle and BSN in the Czech republic or General Motors
in Poland.
The slowness of disbursement may have been exacerbated by one of its
fundamental investment tenets - that its equity injections should only be a
small proportion of the amount that it lends.
According to Mr Attali an equity injection can be used for working capital
or for investment, and disbursement can rapidly follow approval of the
finance.
Loans are often made to finance infrastructure projects, however, such as
improvements of roads or telecommunications, or oil and gas production. Bank
funds are released only as physical progress is made with these projects.
Mr Pierre Pissaloux, director in charge of planning and budget, said equity
was typically disbursed in full two years after approval. The rate of
disbursal for an infrastructure loan was much slower, however, taking five
to eight years.
Mr Pissaloux said the bank had set itself a target of disbursing between
Ecu700m and Ecu820m this year. It also planned to approve more than 100 new
projects, with a bank contribution of between Ecu2bn and Ecu2.6bn.
If the rate of disbursement fell below target its shareholders might
encourage it to approve more equity injections. That would require the bank
to take more risks, however, since equity investments are by definition more
risky - and anyway potentially viable businesses are currently thin on the
ground in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Mr Attali said: 'I think there is a real choice for the bank. I need to have
the clear view of shareholders.'

FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: No place for a party pooper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR City banker recently bemoaned the passing of the tradition by which
banks entertained their staff at Christmas. Not so the EBRD. Last Christmas
it entertained more than 600 people to a party at London's prestigious
Grosvenor House Hotel - 500 of these staff and the rest members of the board
and long-term consultants.
The party took place in the hotel's Great Room, the largest banqueting hall
in London.
The most the hotel's marketing manager Ms Suzy Barry is prepared to say
about what went on in a ballroom, with a capacity for up to 1,500 guests, is
that the Pounds 80-a-head occasion included a three-course meal which was
'one of our cheaper menus'.
The event, which was described by Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president,
as 'not incredibly lavish', cost Pounds 52,000.
Mr Pierre Pissaloux, the director in charge of planning and budget, said:
'We wanted to mark the move to the new offices with a party because the
conditions for some people at the old offices in Leadenhall Street were
terrible.'
The event was booked and organised by the assistant to the president, Mr
Francois Olive, who selected the menu: Japanese consomme, English roast beef
and fruit salad.
The red and white wine was from Bulgaria. 'French wine is more expensive,
and anyway we thought it was better to spend more on trade with eastern
Europe,' Mr Olive said.

FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: Reconstructing and developing
a new working environment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'WE KNEW we didn't like it. It didn't give us the right feeling. It was too
complicated.' Pierre Pissaloux, EBRD's director in charge of planning and
budget, was speaking of the marble which used to grace the bank's main
lobby.
This was Travertine marble, similar to that installed in other neighbouring
buildings in the Broadgate complex, but it was removed and replaced with
some hewn slabs of very high-quality statuary marble specially imported from
Forte di Marmi in Tuscany. It cost Pounds 750,000.
The new marble is set out in a sequence or gradation that would not look out
of a place in a museum of Modern sculpture. The creamy white pieces,
reflected by a mirrored ceiling, range from rough rock to polished marble.
The marble is only one of several distinctive features of a building that
was developed by Mr Stuart Lipton, of Rosehaugh Stanhope, and fitted out by
Bovis Construction according to a brief given by the bank's president to an
Anglo-French design team. Other features include:
An entrance hall designed less to keep out predators than to impress
visitors. The internal security barrier looks like a prop from the film Star
Wars. It is a horizontal wooden slab with a mock marble painted finish.
Activated by remote control, it slides to one side before slotting back into
place. Nearby video screens project the national flags of the EBRD's member
countries
The construction of a large auditorium on the first floor of the building to
house 300 people. This will cost about Pounds 1m but has yet to be completed
because the complex engineering involves removal of two massive structural
columns to make room for the seating.
The main staff dining room (there are nine dining rooms) called the
'Mozart'. Apart from posters and paintings of the great composer it is
fitted with wall-to-wall multi-coloured carpets and sycamore-lined walls.
Its laminated tables and linen-covered chairs were specially designed for
the architects, the Anglo-French group Berthet, Pochy, Sidell &amp; Gibson. Mr
Jean Louis Berthet, said: 'Our brief was to make people working in the bank
happy. We didn't want a cafeteria that was uncomfortable and noisy.' Hence a
very modern and chic restaurant designed for people either with many hours
to spend in the bank or with time on their hands.
Works of art in the building are, in the words of bank officials, aimed at
reflecting Europe in its 'full cultural and intellectual diversity'. Some of
the more prestigious items, such as a set of Piranese engravings, were
donated by the Italian government. In addition, the bank has commissioned
artists, mainly from eastern Europe, to display their works on site. The
boldest example is a giant fresco by a group of French and Russian painters
which depicts Europe's great thinkers beneath a giant globe. Mr Pissaloux
says the bank has spent about Pounds 250,000 in purchasing works of art.
Among items expected to come in the next few weeks is a large segment of the
Berlin Wall donated by the German authorities. The plan, according to Mr
Pissaloux, is to place the segment outside the bank's headquarters facing a
large sculpture of a fat lady.

FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: The bank that likes to say
yes - to itself - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
been one of the most imaginative initiatives taken by western nations in
response to the economic and political turmoil brought about by the collapse
of communism. But so far much of its money has been spent internally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991 to
help eastern Europe build on the ruins of communism with private investment.
Two years later, as delegates attending next week's annual meeting in London
will learn, the main beneficiaries of its largesse have been its staff,
consultants, building contractors and aircraft leasing companies.
It has provided considerably less in loans and investments to the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe than it has consumed on fitting out its
London offices, paying salaries and meeting other overheads.
Here are the facts:
From April 15 1991 to the end of last year its total running costs, mainly
salaries, travel costs and general overheads, have been Pounds 128m. Its
budget for 1993, which is denominated in European Currency Units, is Ecu136m
(Pounds 109m).
It spent Pounds 18m of UK government funds on equipping its previous office,
which it occupied for less than two years before moving to its new office
block at Number One Exchange Square in the City last December. It is in the
process of spending a further Pounds 55.5m on fitting out this building.
By the end of last year it had disbursed only Ecu126m (Pounds 101m) in loans
and investments to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This is just
half what it allocated to its buildings and its running costs in the same
period.
Some disparity between the costs of running the bank and the initial
provision of finance to the region was inevitable. Start-up costs for any
new institution are big and it was explicitly modelled on the World Bank,
whose running costs are substantial.
But the bank's intellectually dynamic founder and president Mr Jacques
Attali, who for much of the 1980s was the special adviser to the French
President, Mr Francois Mitterrand, admits that 'disbursement (of loans and
investments) is amazingly slow in terms of our (original) forecast'.
He adds, however: 'I would say it is a good thing, because it demonstrates
that we are very cautious.' He says he would be facing considerable
criticism from his shareholders - the leading industrial countries together
with those of the former Eastern bloc - if the bank were being reckless in
its investment policy.
The bank also points out that it has stayed within its administrative and
building budgets, which have all been approved by these shareholders,
including Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, who is one of
the bank's governors.
Mr Attali's talents for designing grand schemes for the regeneration of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are not in doubt. But he is not
by nature a financial controller or a chief executive. Two questions
therefore suggest themselves concerning the execution of the bank's mission:
Should the investment policy of the bank be loosened to facilitate a more
rapid disbursement of funds?
Does the budget-making process put enough pressure on the bank to keep its
expenditure in check?
Mr Attali appears to have inherited from Mr Mitterrand a passion for
monumental architecture - the slabs of Carrara marble which frame the lifts
in the lofty mirrored entrance may have been expensive, but the bank says
they have great symbolic significance.
A different kind of marble, Travertine, was originally installed. According
to Mr Pierre Pissaloux, a former high-flying French civil servant who is the
bank's budget director, this marble was inappropriate. So it was replaced by
Carrara statuary slabs in various stages of polish, at a cost of Pounds
750,000.
The point of the exercise, said Mr Pissaloux, was that the new marble
represented what the EBRD was trying to do for people in eastern Europe  -
'changing them from something rough into something polished'.
Mr Attali said he was not embarrassed by the bank's opulent offices. He said
he had a 'duty to provide them (employees) with a very good environment' as
compensation for the reduced pay they earn at the bank compared with what
they could receive in the private sector.
He also set a condition that the building cost should be 'below the average
cost' of comparable projects in the City. Both arguments in favour of the
building are questionable.
Some of Mr Attali's colleagues came from the private sector, but most say
they were lured by the challenge and excitement of changing the face of
eastern Europe.
They could probably earn more if they returned. However, the average EBRD
salary - including secretaries and lower-grade staff - is Ecu58,300, high
compared with most public-sector organisation but not by World Bank
standards.
EBRD employees do not pay UK taxes, thanks to the founding charter signed by
the government. But the bank itself levies an 'income tax' averaging about
10 per cent which it uses to help finance its operations. The average salary
is equivalent therefore to a UK gross salary of more than Pounds 65,000.
Mr Attali is the highest paid employee, with a 1992 salary of Pounds 150,000
after deduction of the internal tax.
Were he to pay UK taxes, this would be the equivalent of a gross salary of
more than Pounds 240,000 - Pounds 75,000 more than the governor of the Bank
of England received last year, Pounds 163,000 more than the prime minister
and Pounds 40,000 less than the basic salary of the chairman of National
Westminster Bank.
Mr Attali has said he wants to waive the EBRD'S general pay rise of 5.5 per
cent for the current year.
The question of whether the Pounds 55.5m fitting-out cost is reasonable by
City standards is more complicated. The UK government was desperate to
attract the bank to London - it is the only leading international
institution of its kind in the British capital - and provided Pounds 40m
towards the costs of its offices. The bank spent Pounds 18m of this on its
offices in Leadenhall Street - which it occupied for 20 months - and the
balance of Pounds 22m is being spent on the new headquarters. The bank
received an additional Pounds 250,000 grant from the Corporation of London.
The building covers 403,000 sq ft in total. The cost of fitting out that
space per sq ft is Pounds 138. Only 320,000 sq ft of that space is usable,
however, which pushes the cost up to Pounds 173 per sq ft. Building
consultants say that both figures are at the top end of normal fitting out
costs.
Mr Pissaloux disputed that judgment. The bank, he pointed out, had special
needs, such as translation facilities for its annual meeting and
conferences. If these special factors were excluded, he said, the cost per
sq ft was Pounds 108. 'That is at the lower end of City fit-out costs,' he
said. 'I am at ease with that.'
Gleeds, the quantity surveyors, said that fitting-out costs for a large
merchant bank's office would typically be about Pounds 70 per sq ft for
gross space in a shell and core building (a building containing neither
furnishings nor mechanical and electrical equipment).
Mr Pissaloux also said that part of the building's cost had been met from
saving rent due on the Leadenhall offices and by striking an advantageous
deal with the building developer, Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments.
By finishing work on its Exchange Square building ahead of schedule the bank
was able to save six months' rental payments for Leadenhall. That rent
saving was worth Pounds 6m, Mr Pissaloux said. In addition Rosehaugh
Stanhope Developments, the building's developer, gave Pounds 9.5m towards
the fitting-out costs, plus a rent-free period of two years and five months,
which is worth Pounds 38m.
Property agents said, however, that the deal with Rosehaugh was in line with
market conditions at the time. 'When the EBRD was looking, the market was
dead,' said a surveyor. 'Property companies were falling over themselves to
deal with it.'
The bank is paying Pounds 39.5 per sq ft, which is well below the peak rents
paid for space in adjacent buildings in the late 1980s but well above
today's prices for top-quality City space, which range between Pounds 25 and
Pounds 35. Mr Pissaloux insisted: 'We got the best price at the time.'
Mr Pissaloux also pointed out that there was a break in the lease after 15
years, allowing the bank either to move out or seek more attractive terms
then.
He was also proud of having secured a warranty which meant that the landlord
had to pay for any structural defects which might emerge in the building
over the next 12 years - which agents say is unusual.
Staff moved to the new building just before Christmas and the move was
celebrated with a party held at London's Grosvenor House Hotel. Mr Attali
said the party's cost was 'very low'. In fact, it amounted to Pounds 52,000,
Pounds 80 for each of the 650 employees or consultants who attended.
The bank also argued that Mr Attali's regular use of rented private
airplanes was value for money. Mr Attali said he used private jets on two
sorts of occasions only: when he had to fit in a large number of meetings
over a short period in many different countries (as happened quite
frequently), or if his destination was not served by regular international
flights (which was the case in many parts of the former Soviet Union).
He spent Pounds 600,000 last year on private jets. Mr Pissaloux said that he
had earmarked between Pounds 350,000 and Pounds 400,000 in this year's
budget for between 15 and 18 trips by private jet - this comes to about
Pounds 22,000 per flight.
Mr Pissaloux stresses that all expenses were overseen by the bank's board of
directors, who are government officials representing the 53 countries which
are the bank's shareholders. Even the building costs had stayed within the
special capital budget approved at the end of 1991.
The main responsibilities of these directors is to approve loans,
investments and spending. A series of board committees scrutinise salaries
(the remuneration committee), the annual budgets (the finance committee) and
the annual accounts (the audit committee).
One director insisted that they were a tough independent force, whose aim
was to ensure that the bank did not waste money. But, in the matter of their
own remuneration, they were not independent from the EBRD.
As Mr Attali said: 'It's a very strange system - we pay for them but they
are representing their governments.'
The directors, who are typically secondees from the shareholders' civil
services, receive EBRD salaries and EBRD tax breaks. 'It's enormous pay
compared to a normal civil servant,' said Mr Atalli.
In 1992 the 23 directors, their 23 alternates and 23 secretaries, who occupy
two floors of the bank's head office, were paid an average salary before the
10 per cent tax of Ecu87,000 each - equivalent to a UK gross salary of
Pounds 100,000. It is arguable that if directors were paid directly by their
governments they might exert tougher financial disciplines on the bank.
The experience of private-sector companies also suggests that any board as
big as the EBRD's will rarely have the cohesion to put significant pressure
on executives.

added to the credit rates when fixing at bid. Interest rates may not be
fixed for longer than 120 days.
SDR-based rates of interest are the same for all currencies but must
be used only for the OECD-defined poor countries. For the period from
Jan 15 through July 14, the SDR-based rate will be 7.55 per cent. It
replaces the previous rate of 8.10 per cent. The SDR-based rate will
again be subject to change on July 15.

FT  13 APR 93 / Steel output forecast cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Meps (Europe), the Sheffield-based steel consultancy, is reducing its
forecast for European crude steel production this year by 1.5m tonnes, to
129m tonnes, due to substantial weakening of demand in Germany, writes
Andrew Baxter. The consultancy had originally forecast output this year of
130.5m tonnes, against 132m in 1992.
In its latest quarterly outlook, Meps forecasts that German crude output
will fall from 39.7m tonnes in 1992 to 37m tonnes this year. However, steel
demand in the UK is forecast to increase, with production rising from 16m
tons last year to 16.7m.
On the export front, Meps notes that European output of semi-finished
products, such as billets, for the US market have been increasing in the
past few months.

FT  13 APR 93 / Scepticism over motives for Nigeria's fuel price pledge: IMF
team to urge cut in petrol subsidies despite warnings of violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN International Monetary Fund team due to arrive in Lagos today will be
urging Nigeria to cut subsidies which make its petrol the cheapest in the
world, despite warnings that a rise in fuel prices could prompt violence.
Nigeria's civilian-led transitional council has pledged, in the face of
widespread opposition, to reduce the subsidies on June 1, as part of a
package designed to secure an agreement with the IMF. This would pave the
way for rescheduling the country's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) debt to the
Paris Club of official creditors, on which payment arrears exceed Dollars
3bn.
But cutting the subsidy, say some observers, could lead to violence and
further delay the handover by soldiers who have been in power since December
31 1983.
President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military ruler, who in December
appointed the council to run the government until the scheduled handover to
civilian rule in August, last week took what appeared to be a precautionary
measure: the issue of a military decree giving Nigeria's electoral
commission power to postpone the presidential poll set for June 12 if
serious unrest becomes likely.
'It is obvious that an increase in the fuel price will automatically cause a
breach of the peace,' the Lagos-based Committee for the Defence of Human
Rights said. 'Thus, the decree is not just a pre-emptive, panicky measure
but part of the grand design for perpetual clinging on to power by the
military,' the CDHR statement said.
Raising the price of the world's cheapest fuel (3 cents a litre) to the
level of import parity would put an estimated N41bn (Pounds 845m) in
government coffers.
Much of the money would go on social services, say the council, but the
public is sceptical. They fear the funds will be squandered like much of
government revenue in the past. Fears have not been eased by the appointment
of leading Nigerians to monitor the spending process.
Trade unionists have threatened strikes, and church leaders have warned of
mass demonstrations. Neither Mr Bashir Tofa, the National Republican
Council's (NRC) presidential candidate, or Mr Moshood Abiola, his
counterpart from the Social Democratic party (SDP), are prepared to swim
against the tide of popular opinion, leaving Mr Ernest Shonekan, chairman of
the council, to shoulder full responsibility,
Mr Shonekan seems undeterred. With his tenure due to end in August, and with
no need to seek a mandate from the electorate, he has pledged to take the
hard decision which has been ducked by successive governments.
In the meantime, smuggling of fuel into neighbouring states has increased in
anticipation of price rises. Out of the 300,000 barrels of oil a day
allocated to domestic use (total daily production averages around 2m bpd),
as much as a third is thought to disappear across the borders. A tanker of
fuel worth N40,000 at the official price can fetch N1.2m in a neighbouring
country.
Just what price will be set in June is still unclear. The state-owned
petroleum corporation is considering a two-price structure, charging about
N5 a litre for a new premium grade fuel and N0.7 for a lesser grade, which
will be phased out.
Some observers believe the impact of the increase will not be as bad as
feared. For many motorists, they point out, the price of 3 cents a litre is
notional: the combination of smuggling and breakdowns in refineries has
meant that in much of the northern half of Nigeria they have to pay as much
as N5 already.
Nor should the rise in bus and taxi fares elsewhere in Nigeria match the
fuel increase, as the country's experience with airline fares demonstrated.
Last month, when the government raised the price of aviation fuel by 400 per
cent, domestic airlines immediately increased fares by 500 per cent,
although fuel accounts for a comparatively small part of their running
costs. But passenger refusal to pay the new rates forced the airlines to
limit the increase to 75 per cent.
No doubt the IMF team will make these points themselves. But it will still
require a steady nerve on Mr Shonekan's part to implement the most critical
decision of his tenure.

FT  13 APR 93 / Tokyo haggles on economy: Finance Ministry questions figures
in stimulatory package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party and Finance Ministry officials were
last night haggling over the final figures for a stimulatory economic
package due to be delivered today, which the LDP insists will total more
than Y12,000bn (Pounds 69.7bn).
Negotiations have been complicated by recent political scandals which have
sidelined Mr Shin Kanemaru and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the LDP powerbrokers who
played influential roles in securing the ministry's approval for a Y10,700bn
emergency package announced last August.
The contents of the fresh package were renegotiated in the light of a recent
surge in Tokyo stock prices and after advice from the Economic Planning
Agency that a heavy weighting towards infrastructure investment could lead
to overheating in some sectors of the economy. But the need for a package
was reaffirmed yesterday by the publication of EPA data showing a 15.9 per
cent fall year-on-year in private machinery orders during February, the 11th
consecutive month of decline.
The figures reflect cuts in capital spending by most Japanese manufacturers.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the LDP panel preparing the new measures,
promised yesterday that the total would exceed last year's package. However,
Finance Ministry officials say privately that the economy appears to have
bottomed out and may not need another large injection of public funds.
The ministry concedes the package will be closely watched in Washington. Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, leaves for the US later this week and will
want to bring evidence that the Japanese government is attempting to meet
its optimistic forecast of 3.3 per cent growth for the current fiscal year.
Mr Miyazawa also plans to tell President Bill Clinton that the two countries
should establish a new forum to replace the Structural Impediments
Initiative, designed to reduce Japan's current account surplus. The US
argues that the slowing of Japanese growth weakened demand for imports and
encouraged exports, pushing the trade surplus to a record Dollars 107bn last
year.
About Y1,000bn in special 'infrastructure' spending in the package will be
devoted to the purchase of computers by Japanese educational and medical
institutions, and Mr Miyazawa is expected to suggest to Mr Clinton that US
companies could win a large share of these contracts.
The LDP had debated the introduction of income tax cuts to stimulate
consumer demand, particularly weak in recent months, but the Finance
Ministry, concerned by declining corporate tax revenue, has argued against
the cuts. Instead, special deductions are likely to be announced for
education expenses and housing purchases.
It is expected that the limit for tax deductions on housing loans will be
raised by 20 per cent, which is not enough to satisfy Mr Tetsuro Aki,
president of Tokyu Real Estate, who said the housing industry wanted larger
concessions to ensure the recovery of a still weak market.
The Finance Ministry's concerns about flagging tax income were reflected in
its announcement yesterday that gold coins would be minted to commemorate
the June wedding of Prince Naruhito, heir to the throne. Ministry officials
say Y50bn-Y60bn raised through the issue will go towards paying for a small
portion of today's package.

FT  13 APR 93 / Border bustle conceals neighbourly suspicion: A look at the
tensions affecting Vietnam and China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING in the bustling commercial scene at the main border post between
China and Vietnam contradicts the idea of a warm relationship suggested by
the name Friendship Gate.
Under a drizzling sky, cheerful traders carry boxes of Chinese apples,
sewing machines and rice bowls from Chinese to Vietnamese lorries parked
back-to-back in a sea of mud. A raucous, red-faced Chinese woman smuggling
playing cards into Vietnam supervises her workers as they pile empty
lightbulb cartons into a truck to hide the real merchandise.
For the region's desperately poor inhabitants, the trade is a welcome
spinoff of the 1991 'normalisation' of relations between Beijing and Hanoi -
12 years earlier the Chinese army invaded and laid waste this part of
northern Vietnam to avenge the invasion of Cambodia and the overthrow of the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.
But the busy scenes at the border belie the reality of the Sino-Vietnamese
relationship. In spite of frequent exchanges of high-level dignitaries and
the signing of several bilateral agreements, the two countries continue to
regard each other with suspicion and, sometimes, outright hostility.
Since last year China has not only dragged its feet in implementing trade
agreements and attempted to extend its control across the frontier, but has
made forays into the southern reaches of the South China Sea close to the
Vietnamese coast. This has threatened development of Vietnam's vital oil
industry and triggered alarm in other south-east Asian countries, such as
Malaysia, about the future of the disputed Spratly islands.
Beijing granted last year an offshore oil exploration concession to
Crestone, a US company, in an area Vietnam says is on its continental shelf.
Vietnam says China has also seized more than 20 cargo vessels plying the
route between Hong Kong and northern Vietnam. The ships have been released
but the Chinese, accusing the Vietnamese shippers of smuggling goods to
China, have confiscated some cargo without compensation.
'China sees this as a good opportunity to fill the power vacuum left by the
reduction of US forces in the region and the strategic retreat from the
region made by Russia,' says Mr Nguyen Ngoc Dien of the Hanoi Foreign
Ministry's Institute of International Relations. Vietnam treats Chinese
denials with scepticism.
'In their declarations they are anti-hegemonist but in practice they are
hegemonist in putting pressure on the smaller countries around them,' says
Maj-Gen Tran Cong Man, a government spokesman.
Even the booming border trade between the two countries is a source of
friction. Vietnam says China is reluctant to promote official commerce - it
has refused to re-open the railway near Friendship Gate - and is instead
encouraging smuggling of Chinese consumer goods, a trade which undermines
Vietnamese factories.
'With smuggling,' says Mrs Pham Chi Lan, of the Vietnamese Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, 'we are spending a lot of hard currency needed for
the import of capital goods on buying products that can be produced in
Vietnam.'
The Vietnamese, who have fought against Chinese domination for the last
2,000 years, are feeling particularly nervous about China's military and
economic might at the moment. The peace agreement in neighbouring Cambodia
appears to be falling apart, leaving the way clear for Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, Beijing's former proteges, to kill Vietnamese settlers and cause
trouble on the border.
The trouble for Hanoi is that there is not much it can do without provoking
China or undermining its fragile economic recovery. Ethnic Chinese
businessmen still dominate the Vietnamese economy, and a large share of
foreign investment is of Chinese ethnic origin, coming from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Singapore.
Vietnam's army has been halved in size to some 600,000 men, and the navy is
too small to protect Vietnamese interests in the South China Sea. The Soviet
Union, Vietnam's long-time ally, has disintegrated.
Hence Vietnam's desperate attempts to make friends with the US - which
maintains an economic and diplomatic embargo on Hanoi dating back to the
Vietnam war - and to strengthen ties with the European Community.
As one diplomat in Hanoi put it: 'Vietnam is in the unfortunate position of
having lost one superpower and being unlikely to get an alliance with the
one remaining.'

GENERAL John Vessey, a special US emissary to Hanoi, will this week push
Vietnam to confirm or deny a newly discovered secret report claiming that
Hanoi held 1,205 US prisoners of war in 1972, more than double the number
returned to the US at the end of the Vietnam war, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
According to Izvestia newspaper, the document was discovered in a search of
former Soviet archives.
The prisoner of war issue has long prevented improved US-Vietnamese
relations. The Clinton administration has been under pressure from business
to renew relations with its former enemy now that it has opened its borders
to investment and trade.
Miss Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said relations with Vietnam
could not be normalised until the US was certain Vietnam was doing all it
could to account for Americans missing during the war. Only 591 prisoners
were released.

FT  13 APR 93 / Developed-country victims of the technological age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STROKING British manufacturers, who are still sore after a decade of
neglect, has become a cross-party activity in post-Thatcherite Britain.
Neither main political party appears to have clear ideas about how
government can revive Britain's dwindling industrial base. But both agree
that manufacturing matters after all.
This rediscovery of the importance of manufacturing industry is probably
long overdue. That Britain has a current account deficit of more than 2 per
cent at the bottom of a long recession certainly suggests that its traded
goods industries, predominantly manufacturing, have been allowed to shrink
too far. The case for subsidising investment in equipment is strengthened by
new evidence from the US of a powerful link between such investment and
economic growth (Post-communist dilemmas for would-be activists, FT March 22
1993).
But a manufacturing revival, however desirable to close the trade deficit,
would not solve the problem of high unemployment and falling relative wages
among poorly educated workers that Britain shares with much of the rest of
the developed world. It is tempting to see the decline in British
manufacturing employment in the early 1980s as the cause of the growth of
unskilled unemployment and wage inequality that followed. Tempting but
misleading, for wage inequality in the US grew faster than in the UK in the
1980s even though US manufacturing performed relatively well compared both
to British industry and the US economy as a whole.
The shift in demand for labour, and thus wage differentials, in favour of
skilled and educated workers has also occurred within US manufacturing
industry. Consistently, over the past 30 years, the growth of manufacturing
output, capital and raw materials in US manufacturing has outstripped
employment, according to recent research released by the US National Bureau
of Economic Research. But, while the number of non-production workers has
continued to grow, blue-collar employment has stagnated since the mid-1970s,
as the chart shows. Between 1979 and 1989 the employment of US production
workers fell by 2.2m to 12.3m, while non-production employment increased by
0.2m to 6.7m, raising the share of non-production employment from 23 per
cent in 1973 to 29 per cent in 1989.
Labour-saving technological change, not just low-wage, labour-intensive
competition from developing countries, is the primary reason for the decline
in blue collar employment, according to the NBER research. The share of high
technology capital in the total manufacturing capital stock rose from 1 to 7
per cent between 1973 and 1989. And, while the share of imports in total US
manufacturing shipments also doubled over that period, less than a third of
the increase in the share of non-production workers in total employment in
the 1980s occurred because old, labour-intensive industries were replaced by
new, high-tech industries. More than two thirds of the increase in
non-production employment occurred within existing industries as they
upgraded their technology and expanded the use of computers.
Not surprisingly, non-production workers - engaged in supervision,
management and administration, technology and product development, sales and
delivery - are more likely to have educational qualifications and are better
paid than their blue collar counterparts. More than 90 per cent of
non-production workers graduated from high school in 1987, compared with 70
per cent of production workers; only 17 per cent of blue collar workers
attend further education, half the average for all manufacturing employees.
Manufacturing may matter; but only an increase in educational investment can
solve the problem of unskilled unemployment and rising wage inequality.

labour within US manufacturing industries,' Working paper 4255, NBER, 1050

SEOUL should cooperate more closely with Beijing instead of relying solely
on the US in resolving the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapon
programme, South Korea's new ambassador to China said yesterday, writes John
Burton in Seoul.
'We have seen issues too much through western eyes in the past,' Mr Hwang
Byung-tai, a former close aide to South Korean president Kim Young-sam, told
a news conference.
His blunt remarks underscore a growing divergence of views between Seoul and
Washington on the nuclear issue, matched by closer ties with China - after
diplomatic links were established last August. 'I believe it is time for us
to take into account Chinese perspectives in dealing with South-North
(Korean) issues,' Mr Hwang said.
He added China was likely to play a pivotal role in solving the nuclear
crisis as it was the principal supplier of food, oil and coke to North
Korea.

CLAD in a beautiful but constraining gold kimono, Ms Masako Owada yesterday
hobbled in traditional shoes towards her future as a bride to Japanese Crown
Prince Naruhito, heir to the Chrysanthemum throne.
Since her engagement became public in January, Ms Owada has been at the
centre of a fierce debate over whether she is a symbol of a new era of
openness for the imperial family or a career woman who has sacrificed
herself to the home. Yesterday's engagement ceremony suggested the career
diplomat's future would be ruled by ritual and formality.
The imperial household agency, famous for its tight control over royal
affairs, also indicated it would stick to tradition by holding next week a
ceremony to notify the Owadas of the June 9 wedding date - a fact most
Japanese have known for months.
Meanwhile, Japanese executives are still waiting for the 'Masako boom' to
spur consumer demand and lead the economy out of its downturn.
When the engagement was announced, some analysts said a royal wedding could
spur an extra Y3,300bn (Pounds 19bn) in retail spending. Their prediction
was based on a rise in consumer confidence ahead of the wedding of Akihito,
the current emperor, and empress Michiko in 1959, when consumers rushed to
buy television sets to watch the wedding and triggered a 'Michi boom' for
electronics manufacturers.
Today, most Japanese households already own more than two television sets.
But while Japanese corporations could be disappointed, many Japanese have
been pleasantly surprised by the prince's recent comments vowing to
'protect' Miss Owada. Empress Michiko, who was also a commoner, is known to
have been tormented by the antagonism and pressures of the imperial palace.

<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has demanded help from Mr
Nawaz Sharif, prime minister of Pakistan, in finding the men held
responsible for the terrorist blasts which last month rocked Bombay.
Mr Rao and Mr Sharif met at the weekend during a regional summit in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. It was their first encounter since the destruction of the
Ayodhya mosque in December set off a wave of Hindu-Moslem violence in India
and damaged relations between India and Pakistan.
Bilateral ties were further strained by the Bombay blasts, which India
believes were carried out with the support of groups in Pakistan.
Mr Rao asked Mr Sharif to co-operate in tracing members of a family involved
in organised crime in Bombay, whom Indian investigators suspect of having
planned the bombings. Indian officials believe the family fled from Bombay
to Dubai and may have subsequently gone to Pakistan. Mr Sharif promised to
help in the search.
Indian police probing the blasts, which left about 300 dead and around 1,000
injured, have arrested about 50 people. Many of them are suspected of having
worked for the accused family.
Police said they had found a further 800kg of explosives, taking the total
since the blasts to over 4,500kg, in addition to the estimated 300kg used in
the blasts.
Meanwhile, the Dhaka summit agreed to establish a preferential trading zone
of the six member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Co-operation - Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Violence yesterday hit Srinagar and other towns in Kashmir for the fourth
day in succession. About 100 people have been killed in fighting between
Indian security forces and supporters of groups battling for independence or
union with Pakistan.

FT  13 APR 93 / Japan to announce Dollars 1.2bn aid package for Russia:
Miyazawa wants G7 ministers' meeting in Tokyo tomorrow to discuss the yen's
rapid appreciation
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN will help Russia dispose of nuclear waste as part of a bilateral aid
package worth about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 795m) to be announced at
tomorrow's meeting of foreign and finance ministers from the Group of Seven
leading industrialised nations.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who will announce the package, also
suggested yesterday that the visiting ministers, in Tokyo for a two-day
meeting, should discuss the rapid appreciation of the yen, which closed
yesterday in Tokyo at a record Y112.95 to the dollar.
However, the US has supported a stronger yen in the hope of reducing Japan's
trade surplus, and is unlikely to agree to international intervention to
stabilise the Japanese currency.
The yen's appreciation has gathered pace in recent days, prompting
complaints from export industries.
Japan's assistance package is likely to comprise a Dollars 1bn trade
insurance programme and around Dollars 200m in humanitarian aid and
technological assistance, particularly to the Russian nuclear industry.
The already tense relationship between Moscow and Tokyo was further soured
by reports last month that the Russian navy routinely dumped nuclear waste
in the Sea of Japan. There has been no evidence of contamination in Japanese
waters, but Mr Miyazawa and other senior ministers were outraged by the
dumping.
Japan intends to propose to other G7 members that assistance to Russia be
specifically linked to the continued rule of President Boris Yeltsin, whose
authority will be tested at a referendum on April 25. Officials in Tokyo say
international aid is intended to encourage democracy and it should be made
clear to Moscow that the defeat of Mr Yeltsin would compromise that process.
While Japan will announce its own bilateral package, Japanese officials say
they will support a move within the Group of Seven to draw attention away
from huge figures for multilateral assistance, much of which has yet to be
delivered, and which creates pressure for ever larger packages.
US officials in Washington were last week urging Japan, as host to the
summit, to increase its aid to Russia.
The bulk of the money available to help Russia in its economic reforms is
likely to come from the International Monetary Fund and other multinational
financial institutions.
It is expected that the G7 meeting will ratify total multilateral assistance
of around Dollars 36bn, including already negotiated debt relief, new
credits from the IMF, and some carry-over from a Dollars 24bn package
announced last year.
So far, however, Russia has been unable to meet the IMF's strict conditions
for setting up a traditional standby financing arrangement, and discussions
have been under way on how to provide funds with looser conditionality.
A US official said, however, that he did not expect conditionality to be
weakened, merely 'streamlined'.
In agreeing to provide bilateral assistance, Japan wants Russia to be 'more
friendly', and to show a medium-term willingness to discuss the return of
the disputed Kurile islands, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the war
in 1945. Japan will not formally raise the issue at the G7 meeting, but will
discuss it in separate talks with Russian officials. In Moscow yesterday,
Itar-Tass news agency was quoting a local official in the islands as ruling
out a settlement for the next 50 to 100 years.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials are still angry at Mr Yeltsin's abrupt
decision to cancel a visit last year, but welcomed reports last night that
he might come to Tokyo before the G7 summit in July. Tokyo has complained
that he is less willing to receive Japanese visitors than senior officials
from other industrialised countries.
At the same time, Japan, as chair of the G7 this year, does not want to be
accused of having blocked assistance to Russia and is keen to draw attention
to its own contributions.
The Dollars 1.2bn in aid will be in addition to Dollars 2.4bn in already
announced trade insurance and medical assistance, about a third of which has
been disbursed.

RUSSIAN unemployment will probably reach 1m by the summer and could rise to
5m by the end of 1993, Mr Oleg Slavutsky, head of the country's federal
employment service, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
He said the number of Russians out of work was 730,000 on April 1, up from
577,000 at the end of 1992. But he added that the data masked about 1.5m of
what he called the 'hidden unemployed', including people on short-time work
or those being forced to take unpaid leave.
Another 2m or 3m people were unable or unwilling to look for work, he said.
He estimated Russia's total workforce to be around about 70m.
'The new law on bankruptcy means that the rise in unemployment will
accelerate in the coming months. By the end of the year we will probably see
five million unemployed.'
Russia launched its economic reform plan at the start of 1992, freeing most
state-controlled prices and promising to sell off state-owned companies. But
even the most unproductive companies have been kept going through loans and
subsidies and unemployment has risen more slowly than originally expected.

FT  13 APR 93 / Bank agrees to limit credit expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian central bank has agreed to credit expansion limits set by the
government, in a move designed to strengthen Russia's credibility with aid
donors at tomorrow's meeting in Tokyo.
The agreement was termed 'a historic event' by Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Fyodorov, who says it means there is hope for a restrictive monetary and
credit policy, without which western financial assistance would be wasted.
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has come under heavy
pressure from Mr Fyodorov to co-operate, said yesterday the bank's board of
directors had decided to 'give the limits a try'. But he quickly poured cold
water on the agreement, saying the government was 'unlikely to be able to
stick to it'.
'In June they'll have to give teachers advance pay for their summer
vacation. So what will the government do then? It will ask the central bank
for money,' he said. 'The only alternative to injecting more money will be
to continue fasting until September.'
The proposed limit is for central bank credit in the second quarter of this
year to increase no more than 30 per cent from the first quarter. According
to Mr Fyodorov, inflation in March was down to 18 per cent a month from 30
per cent in January.
Mr Fyodorov has said he would applaud the central bank if it cut off funds
to the government when the limits are exceeded. But this is unlikely to
happen in practice, if only because the bank will not want to take sole
responsibility for the consequences of refusing government pleas for more
money.
Mr Gerashchenko says that rather than blame him for printing money, the
government should slash budget expenditure, introduce competition and limit
wage increases to help fight inflation.
Having blamed the high inflation and constant fall of the rouble on the
central bank, Mr Fyodorov has already retreated from some of the demands he
made of the bank when he took office in December. He first said the
government should be made to pay a new increased interest rate of 100 per
cent for central bank loans just like commercial banks, but the Finance
Ministry is now to continue paying just 10 per cent - in order to avoid a
big increase in the budget deficit.
Mr Fyodorov, who says spending pressure is such that satisfying various
ministries' demands would require a budget twice as big as envisaged, sees
western financial assistance as a cushion to cut expenditure gradually and
help reduce inflation generated by the printing of money.
Western governments have been worried about the level of inflation in
Russia, fuelled by the printing of money to finance state-owned businesses
and the government deficit.
US officials say, however, that an aid package that provided other sources
of finance for businesses and the budget deficit could contribute to
bringing inflation under control.

worse than first reported

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has ordered safety checks at every nuclear
installation in the country after an explosion at the closed city of Tomsk-7
released plutonium and contaminated largely uninhabited forestland.
Prof Alexei Yablokov, the president's adviser on health and the environment,
said the checks would be conducted by the official atomic supervision
agency, which had previously not been allowed into military sites like the
Tomsk-7 complex.
'There will of course be resistance to this but it will be much more
difficult for these comrades to resist from now on,' he told the Financial
Times. He expected the checks would be completed this year. Asked whether
Russia had the resources to fix problems that would be uncovered, he
replied: 'Of course not, but at least we'll know where things are not
normal.'
Germany and Japan have suggested that help for making nuclear installations
safe should be included on the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of Group of
Seven ministers, meeting in Tokyo to discuss assistance for Russia and
former Soviet republics.
Mr Yablokov could not give any estimates of the damage because he was still
waiting for results of tests on samples of earth and snow. The head of the
atomic supervision agency was also on the spot to work out how much
plutonium, one of the deadliest substances to man, had escaped.
The latest reports however suggest that around 120sq km had been
contaminated by a variety of radioactive substances. The area included a
small settlement called Georgievka and far more than the 'small stretch of
road' initially reported. The tank which exploded, because of a build-up of
pressure due to human error, contained up to 500 grammes of plutonium, part
of which escaped into the atmosphere.
In a rare film of the Tomsk-7 chemical plant and adjacent reactors involved
in nuclear weapons production, Ms Dilbar Klado, a Russian TV journalist,
managed to capture shots including a plutonium storage facility with rusting
windows and broken window panes which had been covered up with wood. She
suggests the damage was due to a previous, unreported explosion.
She also had evidence that plans were under way to start building a national
repository for plutonium but that the building work had been stopped after
complaints by local environmental activists.
But in a testimony to security at the facilities, she said that when her bus
had strayed off the beaten track because of poor visibility, guards had shot
at it.

FT  13 APR 93 / Fyodorov hopes aid will be disbursed quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, said
at the weekend he hoped the G7 ministers' meeting tomorrow would help to set
up 'mechanisms' for aid to be disbursed immediately after the July summit of
western leaders with President Boris Yeltsin in Tokyo.
The prospect of western money flowing after July depends on a tight credit
and monetary policy being in place in Russia by then. If Moscow succeeds in
this policy, a promised rouble stabilisation fund could be deployed in the
second half of this year, Mr Fyodorov suggested.
He did not know what would be on offer at the G7 gathering, although
privately he has complained to western officials that Russia has not been
sufficiently involved in the elaboration of western proposals for
assistance.
Foreign assistance had to show visible benefits to a sceptical Russian
population if it was to help promote reform, he said. 'If this is another
year in which there is a lot of noise or just confirmation of aid promised
earlier it would be catastrophic.'
Mr Fyodorov has also proposed that the west provide a fund to help the
government compensate for the consequences of financial stabilisation, such
as the closure of inefficient enterprises like coal mines. A fund is being
considered to promote small businesses and to help create jobs to counter
rising unemployment. Russia expects unemployment to reach 1m by the summer
and is predicting this could rise to 5m this year.
A special IMF facility is being considered to help countries such as Russia
in switching to a market economy, in addition to traditional IMF standby
loans already available in return for strict conditions.
The special facility, which has yet to be approved by the IMF's board, would
amount to the equivalent of 40 per cent of a country's existing IMF quota.
This would mean that Russia would be eligible for an additional Dollars
2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), in addition to its quota of Dollars 6bn, Dollars 1bn
of which has already been disbursed.
In his news conference at the weekend, Mr Fyodorov also appealed to his own
president, prime minister and parliament to avoid 'destructive' populist
measures in the campaigning for the April 25 referendum and afterwards.
Given that the referendum would be probably be followed by fresh elections
in the autumn, Mr Fyodorov warned that the chances for the situation
stabilising between now and then were 'not great'.

FT  13 APR 93 / Yeltsin starts his campaign with defence of free-market
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin last night launched his referendum campaign,
promising Russians there would 'no second shock' in economic reform but
making clear his radical programme would continue.
In his most personal defence of free-market policies so far, he said he saw
his main role as 'the guarantor of proprietors' and urged his weary
electorate to resist nostalgia for their Soviet past.
'Don't believe any talk about socialist heaven and kind Soviet power,' he
told a group of students in his first big campaign speech. He said the April
25 referendum was about a decisive choice between reforms and 'those who
want to slide back to the past and put a cross on reforms and therefore on
Russia'. He also defended his pro-western policies, proclaiming on the eve
of talks of assistance for Russia in Tokyo that there had been a
'breakthrough in western attitudes to Russian reforms'.
But promising there was 'no need or objective reason' for a new shock after
price liberalisation last January, he said it was time to 'take a deep
breath and shift gear in the reforms'.
He did not specify which gear he would shift to, but everything else in the
speech pointed to a continuation of radical reforms launched last year. He
said state-owned enterprises could no longer expect 'free credits' and would
have to speed 'structural change'. He said the government's main mistake
last year had been to try to 'appease' opponents of its policies.
But he also stressed the need for better legislation to guarantee property
rights, in particular of land, the free sale and purchase of which is still
forbidden by the Russian constitution.
The speech was a vintage Yeltsin combination of brave economic slogans and
populist promises, in which he sought to soothe hurt and confused national
pride. He reassured a weary and impoverished electorate that Russia 'was,
is, and will be a world-class industrial power'. He added that Russia would
not blindly copy the US, the country which Russians are most used to
comparing their country with in terms of military might.
'A market system will not work as strictly as in the US. The state will be
the guarantor of traditional values in this country like social justice. . .
and social protection.'
He won his greatest applause when he announced he had signed a decree
increasing student grants, minutes after calling in his speech for a slowing
down of the printing of money to fight inflation.
Speaking hours after the results of various provincial elections showed low
voter turnout, he recognised the danger of voters not turning out to vote in
large numbers but said he had no choice but to put his fate in their hands.
Relatively dull elections for governors of four Russian provinces attracted
turnout of between 32 per cent in the Orlov region and up to 47 per cent in
Krasnoyarsk area - a particularly low turnout for a country which for
decades was forced to vote.
But the flashy campaign of a 30-year-old rouble billionaire in presidential
elections in the autonomous republic of Kalmykia, which is part of the
Russian Federation, may give some heart to President Yeltsin. Having
subsidised bread and dairy prices in the run-up to the vote, Mr Kirsan
Iliumzhinov beat two former Communists with 65 per cent of the votes cast,
and very high turnout of 82 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES faced further tension and uncertainty last night as jurors in
the controversial Rodney King civil rights case ended their third day of
deliberations without a verdict.
Extra police and hundreds of soldiers were deployed in the central area of
the city, which was unusually quiet yesterday.
The four Los Angeles police officers on trial in a federal court are accused
of violating the civil rights of Mr King, a black motorist who was beaten by
police following a car chase.
Their acquittal in a state court last year enflamed racial tensions in the
city and sparked the worst urban riots in US history, killing more than 50
people and causing an estimated Dollars 2bn in damage.
The second trial has raised widespread fears of a repetition of last year's
mayhem, but Los Angeles' new police chief, Mr Willie Williams, has tried to
calm fears by putting police on the streets and having national guardsmen
stand by.
Despite videotape evidence, the outcome of the civil rights trial was
difficult to predict.
On Saturday, Judge John Davis announced that he would not heed requests by
local and state officials, including the police, school superintendent and
mayor, to delay the announcement of the verdict. Rather than keep jurors
waiting, he told lawyers in the case to be prepared to appear in court at 15
minutes' notice.
The court was under intense pressure to end the case as quickly as possible.
On Easter Sunday church and community leaders appealed for calm, regardless
of the outcome of the trial.
'We have some consensus. This is our city. We must maintain it,' said the
Rev. Cecil Murray. 'We must show the nation and the world that if it can
happen in Los Angeles, it can happen elsewhere. . . citizens, door to door,
heart to heart, saying, 'Let's be cool'.'

FT  13 APR 93 / Haggling on Nafta unlikely to satisfy opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE officials from the US, Canada and Mexico today will resume
negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, although the labour
and environment side pacts being proposed by the US are unlikely to mollify
the strong opposition to the pact in the US Congress.
According to a senior US trade official, the negotiators, meeting in Mexico
City this week, will 'put flesh on the skeleton' of ideas for the
supplemental pacts, discussed in Washington in mid-March. The Clinton
administration will propose to establish trilateral commissions, to promote
supervision and co-operation on labour and environment.
The commissions could produce reports, which would not be binding, and 'the
kind of transparency and scrutiny of what governments are doing that would
ensure that non-enforcement would be much harder to justify,' the official
said.
'Ultimately we feel there would be a need for some sort of dispute
settlement between governments in situations where these international
commissions reveal problems that are not being attended to on a consistent
basis.'
Although the administration is 'very carefully' studying whether to allow
governments to impose sanctions - one demand which tops the lists of most of
the Nafta's environment and labour advisers - there is still widespread
scepticism about the side pacts.
'The Clinton people boxed themselves into a corner politically by promising
not to change any of the original agreement,' said one Nafta opponent. 'Not
only has the administration inherited all of the problems of the package
negotiated by the Bush administration, it is doing little to correct it.'
Ms Leesteffy Jenkins, legal adviser on trade to the Humane Society,
complained of 'disingenuous' replies received during last week's briefing by
a senior trade official when she asked whether the side agreements would
specify the legitimacy of 'process standards' of the type which ban the
import of Mexican tuna caught in drift nets.
'For an administration that was so renowned for its political cunning, I'm
very confused,' said Ms Lori Wallach of Public Citizen. 'In the face of not
only public opposition, but congressional demands, why are they not doing
something major to turn Bush's Nafta into Clinton's Nafta?'

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors was preparing new evidence yesterday to present to the US
government about the safety of its 4.7m trucks built with side-mounted fuel
tanks. Federal safety authorities said last week that the trucks were unsafe
and should be recalled.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not order the trucks
to be recalled but asked the Transportation department to request a recall
based upon its preliminary analysis of the truck's design. However, GM has
chosen to respond immediately to the NHTSA's ruling, which if implemented,
could cost the company Dollars 1bn (Pounds 662m) and seriously damage its
image with consumers.
GM has until the end of the month to provide the NHTSA with new evidence
that its 1973-1987 model pickup trucks, built with twin 'side-saddle' fuel
tanks situated outside the vehicle's frame, are not unsafe.
After its preliminary inquiry, the NHTSA said the design made the truck more
prone to fire risk in side-impact collisions than similar models constructed
with the fuel tanks inside the frame. GM insists the trucks were built
within federal safety guidelines.
If GM fails to convince the NHTSA that the trucks are safe, the agency could
continue its investigation, hold public hearings, and seek a court order
forcing the company to recall the trucks.
Such an outcome would breathe fresh life into dozens of lawsuits already
filed against the company.
The latest development in the truck safety row comes at a difficult time for
GM, which is trying to rebound from heavy losses and shore up its declining
market share. News of the NHTSA's ruling unsettled investors yesterday,
depressing GM's share price by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND is seeking closer security ties with other European countries,
in spite of its traditional strict neutrality policy and the rejection by
Swiss voters last December of closer economic ties with the European
Community.
The Swiss foreign ministry yesterday confirmed a Zurich newspaper report
that closer ties were being sought with European security organisations. But
it said membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or the Western
European Union was not being considered.
The Swiss government, which is not even a member of the United Nations, has
been reviewing its foreign and security policies since the end of the cold
war and in the light of advances in military technology. A report by a group
of experts in March 1992 recommended that only the strictest definition of
neutrality - not participating militarily in wars between other countries -
should be retained.
This would leave the way open for joining the EC and the WEU and for
participating in multilaterally agreed economic sanctions against delinquent
countries. In 1990, the country participated in the UN-sponsored economic
blockade of Iraq.
In the current debate over the government's plan to purchase F/A-18 fighter
aircraft for the Swiss air force, some experts argue that air defence
strategies for a small, landlocked country like Switzerland are now credible
only in the context of co-ordinated European strategies.
The cabinet is expected to announce the conclusions of its security and
foreign policy review during the summer.

<TEXT>
AT Hungary's Hegyeshalom frontier post, customs officers used to search for
smuggled currency and subversive literature from the west. This Easter
weekend, three years after the iron curtain disintegrated, customs officers
on both sides of the Austro-Hungarian border spent their time blocking the
passage of meat and livestock in both directions.
For Hegyeshalom is on a new front-line in the first tit-for-tat trade
conflict between western Europe and its eastern neighbours since their
association agreements with the EC came into effect just over a year ago.
The European Community last week ordered a one-month blanket ban on imports
of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products from across eastern Europe.
Ostensibly the aim is to suppress foot-and-mouth disease, a highly
contagious virus affecting cattle, sheep and pigs. An outbreak in Italy has
been traced to imports of live cattle from the Yugoslav successor states.
But east European governments doubt the EC's good faith. Officials privately
suspect agricultural protectionism motivated the European Commission's
decision.
Budapest and Warsaw quickly retaliated with their own prohibition on imports
and transit of meat and livestock from the EC. Hungary and claimed it would
lose exports of Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) and Poland estimated Dollars 30m.
Both countries said they were unaffected by the disease.
The east European reaction was unprecedented in speed, confidence and anger.
The dispute is symptomatic of a broader trend. East European governments are
wiser now about the gap between liberal trade rhetoric and hardball
practice. The political momentum behind liberalisation of trade between east
and west is fading; and protectionist pressures in both halves of Europe are
growing.
The Commission recently prolonged dumping duties against steel tubes and
pipes, primarily from former Czechoslovakia. Beyond that the EC is issuing
guideline prices for other steel products in order to assess dumping;
working on a new system of tariff quotas for steel; and floating the idea of
'voluntary restrictions' on east European producers.
Austria, outside the EC and the most exposed to eastern competition, is
scheduled this week to apply what officials call 'emergency brakes' on
imports of east European cement, fertilisers and tractors.
US officials say there is a real possibility that the Clinton administration
will blacklist Hungary as an unfair trader alongside South Korea. The US
accuses Hungarian pharmaceutical companies of pirating US drugs. Prospects
are poor for a crucial round of negotiations on the issue this week.
East European countries are themselves moving tentatively in the direction
of protection. Poland is due to announce a new set of customs duties this
month. Hungary is considering 18 tariff increases on paper and other goods.
The measures come against a background of spreading political demands to
restrict imports.
Mr Istvan Major, Hungary's deputy state secretary for trade, identifies a
general 'back-pedalling' on open markets all over eastern Europe.
Eastern Europe could find that defences against imports backfire. Sir Leon
Brittan, the European Community's external economic affairs commissioner,
has urged east European governments to refrain from trade protection if they
want improved access to EC markets. He said that east European governments
needed only to be patient until the forthcoming EC summit in Copenhagen,
where the EC hopes to go beyond the rather limited association agreements in
opening up its markets.
But east European governments are worried that EC concessions, if any, will
come too late to dampen the momentum for trade defences.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE final phase of a lacklustre campaign begins this week to convince
Italians to vote in eight separate referendums that range from changes in
the electoral laws to depenalising the use of drugs.
The referendums, due to be held on April 18 and 19, underline the inability
of the Italian parliament to carry out comprehensive constitutional reform.
The outcome will determine whether Italy drops proportional representation
in favour of a majority voting system in future elections.
The campaign is being headed by Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum
movement who decided to end his 16-year membership of the Christian Democrat
party two weeks ago. He has been the driving force behind the most
politically significant referendum proposal - to abolish the existing system
of proportional representation for electing the Senate.
He is proposing that two thirds of the Senate is elected by a majority vote
and the remainder by proportional representation to safeguard minority
parties. Although the proposal does not apply to the chamber of deputies, if
it is backed parliament will be obliged to extend the majority vote
principle to the lower house.
The other referendum proposals are:
Abolition of the ministries of agriculture, tourism and state shareholdings;
Removal of environmental controls from local health authorities;
Ending state funding of political parties;
Decriminalising personal drug use;
Abolishing state control of bank/savings board nominations.
Two other proposals have been removed by the constitutional court in the
past two weeks since the government has already introduced compatible
legislation. These cover the ending of state aid to the Mezzogiorno and the
direct election of local mayors.
All the main parties are now backing the Yes vote. The four party coalition
government in particular does not wish to be seen as anti-reform.
Opinion polls, never very accurate in establishing Italian voting behaviour,
are agreed that the Yes vote will win. However, the percentage varies from
76 per cent to 58 per cent. The extent of support for the Yes vote will help
determine the composition of the government after the referendum.
A large vote in favour of the reform is likely to put pressure on President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to appoint a government with new faces and a distinct
reformist stamp.
Another factor likely to influence the outcome of negotiations to form a
government is the promise of further revelations this week about alleged
links between Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat
politician, and the Sicilian mafia.

FT  13 APR 93 / Fiat tries to brush off the impact of arrests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE its factories start humming again after the Easter break, a growing
silence is descending on the executive eighth floor of Fiat's headquarters
on tree-lined Corso Marconi in Turin.
The issue last week by Milan magistrates of a cautionary warrant against Mr
Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, takes to seven the number
of its senior executives embroiled in the country's political corruption
scandals.
The focus of the magistrates has moved steadily up Fiat's executive
hierarchy in recent months. The latest detentions of top officials have cast
doubt on the ability of Italy's biggest private sector company to brush off
the scandal's impact.
Mr Garuzzo, in London on business when the warrant was issued, is expected
to return to face the magistrates this week. His lawyers are trying to
negotiate the terms of his return, and he will probably be hoping to avoid
the 38 days spent in Milan's San Vittore prison by his counterpart, Mr
Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, arrested in
February.
The absence of one, and possibly both, senior executives could hardly come
at a worse time. Fiat is at the start of a crucial model replacement
programme designed to restore competitiveness, especially in the crucial
domestic market, where its share fell to 43 per cent last month.
To compound matters Fiat is in the run-up to the change of chairman from Mr
Agnelli to his younger brother Umberto. Meanwhile, Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's
veteran chief executive, will eventually make way for a younger successor,
widely seen as Mr Garuzzo.
So far, Fiat has played down the impact of the arrests on its affairs,
stressing the image of business as usual and the innocence of its managers,
whom it implies were victims of a corrupt system. It has discreetly attacked
magistrates' use of summary arrests and detentions to extract confessions.
Significantly, its tactics changed slightly with Mr Garuzzo. Fiat alluded to
the potential damage to its business. Pointing to recession and cut-throat
competition, Fiat said the magistrates' tactics left it 'preoccupied'.
Fiat has been dealt a difficult hand by the arrests. Immense public support
for the magistrates rules out direct attacks. A ham-fisted approach could
also be taken as 'proof' of its guilt.
Pointing out the potential risks of the investigations to one of Italy's
biggest companies is far more astute. Recession and fears of rising
unemployment mean public opinion is more receptive to arguments based on
business, rather than legal or political, grounds.
But Fiat does not want to create undue uncertainty among its workforce or
shareholders. Its shares have been rising sharply this year on a variety of
fundamental and speculative factors, and it would think twice about creating
an atmosphere of uncertainty.
Yet there is no doubt the investigations are now hurting, and not just the
group's image. The impact is twofold. First, with the arrest of Mr Mattioli
and likely detention of Mr Garuzzo, two of Fiat's three most senior
non-family executives have now been sidelined.
Mr Mattioli, now out of jail but under house arrest in Rome, is in charge of
Fiat's financial affairs and non-industrial activities, such as the big
Fidis financial services operation.
Mr Garuzzo is the head of Fiat's industrial operations, principally the auto
business.
The arrests of two such senior figures inevitably trigger doubts as to how
secure are the positions of those further up the ladder.
Only a few weeks ago, just suggesting magistrates might consider acting
against Mr Romiti, let alone one of the Agnellis, would have been considered
a joke. Given the magistrates' current confidence and the new mood sweeping
Italy, such hints are no longer a laughing matter.

FT  13 APR 93 / Aid bank overheads hit Pounds 200m but E Europe waits for
loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and JIMMY BURNS

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Recon-struction and Development has spent more than
Pounds 200m since its launch two years ago on fitting out its London offices
and meeting overheads, including the use of private jets for its founder and
president and a Pounds 52,000 party for its staff last Christmas.
The Pounds 200m figure is double the amount it has disbursed in loans and
investments to the troubled economies of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
The cost of fitting out its new City of London offices alone is Pounds
55.5m, according to an FT analysis. This includes a Pounds 22m contribution
from the UK government.
The bank, which was set up in April 1991 to stimulate the private sector in
the newly democratised countries of eastern Europe, spent Pounds 18m of UK
public funds on its previous offices, which it occupied for just 20 months
before moving out last December.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he would be asking Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor and an EBRD governor, about the use to which UK
public money had been put.
'These are serious matters which require answers,' he said.
The UK provided the EBRD with a special grant of Pounds 40m as an incentive
to locate its headquarters in London. A Treasury official said: 'It is still
a very young bank . . . In its early years it would tend to have higher
costs and a smaller loan book.'
From April 1991 until the end of last year, the EBRD, which holds its second
annual meeting in London next week, had disbursed Pounds 101m in loans and
investments, compared with Pounds 201.5m spent on furnishing and equipping
its offices, paying staff, travel and administrative overheads.
Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's founder and president, said all the bank's
budgets had been approved by its board of 23 directors, who represent the 53
western and eastern European countries which own the bank.
EBRD expenditure includes:
Pounds 600,000 last year on hiring private aircraft for Mr Attali, or more
than 8 per cent of the bank's total travel budget.
Pounds 750,000 on changing the marble in the building's head office. Pounds
52,000 on a staff Christmas party held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, or
Pounds 80 for each of the 650 consultants or employees who attended.
Mr Attali denied expenditure was excessive. 'I have a duty to provide them
(employees) with a good environment,' he said.
He conceded that disbursement of loans and investments was slow but said
this was a reflection of the bank's caution. He said the EBRD had approved
far more loans and investments than it had actually disbursed.

FT  13 APR 93 / Spain set for early poll as Socialists lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S EMBATTLED prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez yesterday called an
early general election for June 6 in an attempt to staunch the losses his
Spanish Socialist Workers party is suffering in opinion polls.
The Spanish socialists are unlikely to suffer quite the same humiliation as
their French counterparts did recently, but the conservative opposition
Partido Popular has drawn level with the Socialist Workers party (PSOE) at
around 33 per cent of the vote.
It is also understood that a private poll carried out for the socialists in
the past few weeks has, for the first time, shown the PP ahead.
The most likely outcome of the election is that no party will win a majority
in the 350-seat Cortes and that either the socialists or the PP will form a
coalition with one or more regional parties.
The likelihood that the socialists will lose their parliamentary majority
means that a stream of important legislation due to have been passed this
year may now be lost. This includes:
statutes to give the Bank of Spain its independence;
radical changes in pension fund administration;
the separation of generation and distribution functions in the electricity
industry;
a law to govern the behaviour of strikers;
reform of rent controls;
the stripping of power of professional colleges in order to allow prices to
fall.
All are contentious and would need to be renegotiated under a government of
a different complexion.
Mr Gonzalez's move may also unsettle bond and foreign currency markets, with
some market analysts predicting that Spain will soon come under fresh
pressure to devalue the peseta.
Mr Gonzalez has cut short his third term of office after failing, in a
critical PSOE executive committee meeting on Saturday, to make good a
promise made a week earlier that the party would assume political
responsibility for a scandal over the illegal financing of its 1989 general
election campaign.
He had led the country to believe that senior party officials would resign
because of the scandal. Instead, he was outmanoeuvred by PSOE officials and
was forced to make a compromise in which no-one resigned, but which allowed
him to appear to be taking sole control of the party. The financing scandal
had deepened already serious divisions in the PSOE - largely between cabinet
moderates and leftwing party managers - and the prime minister had to choose
on Saturday between making an ethical point or keeping some semblance of
party unity ahead of an election he would have had to call before the end of
November anyway.
Even supporters in the Spanish press were critical of the outcome of
Saturday's meeting, but Mr Gonzalez's announcement to some extent mitigates
charges that he was turning a blind eye to allegations of corruption. He had
hoped to wait until the end of November in the expectation that the economy
might, by then, have begun to show signs of recovery. Now, in his view,
going to the polls in June will put the party to the ultimate test of
political responsibility.
Mr Gonzalez will run for a fourth term in office, but it is not certain that
he will stay through a full legislature if the party wins.
Poll results until now have reflected the government's difficulties with an
economy in recession and a spreading slick of corruption charges, but Mr
Gonzalez remains the country's most popular politician and the socialists
appear the best organised of all Spain's political parties.

FT  13 APR 93 / ERM does not need reform, say central bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism is not in need of fundamental reform,
according to senior EC central bankers.
Instead, they believe members of the European monetary system should pay
more attention to the existing rules - particularly those which allow more
frequent adjustments of European exchange rates within the ERM.
The EC's monetary committee, which meets today in Brussels, is in the final
stages of preparing a report on the workings of the ERM, to be submitted to
finance ministers at their informal meeting in Denmark on May 22.
The monetary experts' report could reignite the debate which raged in Europe
in the aftermath of the September foreign exchange crisis. Since then,
finance ministers, preoccupied with talks about how to encourage EC economic
growth, have left the technicians to their work. But there is still a strong
undercurrent of political concern about the risk of 'competitive
devaluation' of EC currencies, and the need for greater co-ordination
between Germany and other Community members on interest rate policy.
The monetary committee of senior central bank and treasury officials,
together with the European Commission and the committee of EC central bank
governors, is examining what went wrong last September when currency turmoil
forced the lira and sterling out of the ERM. Since then, Spain, Portugal and
Ireland have had to devalue their currencies to stay within the ERM.
At the time, Mr John Major, the prime minister, blamed 'fault-lines' in the
ERM for the problems, and called for its reform. But central bankers say
there has been little serious talk of reform at their meetings. The
secretive monetary committee, which is unlikely to publish its analysis and
recommendations, is believed to oppose significant changes.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said: 'The
lessons from the turmoil are very clear. I think there will be very little
formal change to the rules. The solution will probably be a more rational
and better implementation of existing rules. You can do a lot within the
formal framework.'
Another senior central banker said: 'One of the basic rules of the system is
that rates are fixed - but adjustable.' Early action to adjust rates would
have deterred currency speculation, he added, by reducing tensions in the
system. But ahead of the crisis 'the possibility of making adjustments was
simply ruled out for political reasons'.
According to the same senior central bank official, too many governments
have viewed the ERM as a precursor of European economic and monetary union.
Meanwhile, the recent calm in the ERM should help France to make a symbolic
cut in the least important of its two official interest rates in the next
few days.

FT  13 APR 93 / Pleas to curb South African violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN political leaders yesterday struggled to contain violent
reaction to the assassination of prominent black activist Mr Chris Hani.
Condemnation of the killing from across the political spectrum, coupled with
pleas for restraint from black political leaders, helped to limit the
violence.
Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstands
Beweging (AWB), while confirming that the alleged assassin was an AWB
member, condemned the killing as 'atrocious' over the weekend.
Meanwhile, the African National Congress attempted to channel black anger
into an organised campaign of mass protest action, due to begin today. But
the danger that activists will fail to heed their call was illustrated
yesterday when black gunmen opened fire on police and journalists during a
rally in the Katlehong black township east of Johannesburg, one of several
gatherings held to protest at the assassination of Mr Hani.
The mass action campaign is due to culminate with the funeral of Mr Hani,
which is likely to be one of the largest political events in South African
history. No date has yet been set for the funeral.
ANC leaders made clear that negotiations would continue in spite of the
murder. They issued a statement urging respect for whites and condemning
racial attacks. 'It is true that the person who pulled the trigger that
killed Hani is white . . . equally true is that a white person informed the
police of the registration and the colour of the car that his murderer used
and led to his arrest. Therefore colour does not play a role in this
instance,' the statement said.
Several townships near Johannesburg were reported tense yesterday, with
looting and cars burned, but protests appeared to be under control by
evening.
The worst incident of apparent reaction came when blacks in a township near
Cape Town burned to death three white men who had visited an illegal
drinking establishment on Sunday. Attackers cut off part of the tongue of
one of the men. Police said there was no evidence that the killings were
directly connected to the Hani assassination, but they probably reflect
worsening racial tensions.
ANC Youth League officials called for armed attacks on whites at one
township rally but ANC headquarters deplored the call. Mass protests begin
today with a picket at the Boksburg magistrate's court, where the alleged
assassin, Mr Janusz Walus, is due to appear. Police said they will charge Mr
Walus, a Polish immigrant to South Africa, with Mr Hani's murder.
Mr Walus appears to have links with organised white extremist groups, though
no such group has claimed responsibility. He had a hit-list of 'eight or
nine' assassination targets, including leaders of the ANC, the ruling
National party and Hani's South African Communist party. The weapon used in
the murder was stolen by white-supremacist Piet Rudolf three years ago from
Air Force headquarters in Pretoria.

FFr3.27bn for year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale held its profits last year at a net FFr3.27bn (Dollars
598m), down slightly on the previous year's FFr3.37bn, after avoiding the
losses incurred by many other French banks more heavily involved in
property.
Its relative prudence in property meant it had to increase its provisions by
only 11.2 per cent to FFr6bn, compared with the far larger precautions which
have depressed the 1992 results of many other French banks.
The bank is maintaining its dividend at FFr15 a share.
But both as a reward to loyal shareholders and as protection against a
possible future takeover, it has decided to give any investor holding shares
registered for a period of two years - backdated to January 1 this year -
double voting rights.
Mr Marc Vienot, president, said 'the move does not reflect any particular
danger. But you never know what will happen in the future, and it is better
to take precautions in a period of calm.'
Societe Generale was the subject of a spectacular takeover attempt in 1988,
encouraged by the then Socialist government.
Nearly 40 per cent of the bank is owned by French institutional and
industrial investors, some of whom will be privatised by the new Balladur
government.
Mr Vienot said the bank might take a share in one of its traditional
industrial partners such as Rhone-Poulenc, but would refrain from doing so
in state-owned bank rivals.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Banks agree Heron refinancing - Ronson
family faces loss of control if creditors approve deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TO Heron International have agreed terms of a Pounds 1.4bn debt
restructuring that should allow the property and trading group, founded by
Mr Gerald Ronson, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
Some 15,000 holders of the bearer bonds will receive the proposals within 28
days and will be asked to approve the restructuring at creditor meetings in
June.
If the deal is approved, control of the group will pass from Ronson family
interests and its charitable trust. The banks will end up with 43 per cent
of the equity and bondholders 52 per cent, diluting existing shareholders to
a 5 per cent stake.
In addition, banks and bondholders will receive 30p in the pound in senior
sterling denominated debt and 7p in the pound in junior debt.
The restructuring plan envisages the sale of Heron's property interests by
March 1997. But repayment of the senior debt will only be possible if there
is a modest improvement in the property market. Repayment of the junior debt
will require a more substantial improvement.
Once the junior and senior debt has been repaid - about Pounds 382m - the
Heron management will be able to exercise options that could give them a 25
per cent stake in a revamped group. Heron management will not receive cash
bonuses for hitting debt repayment targets, as had been proposed.
Mr Ronson has also succeeded in maintaining direct family control of the
service station business from which he built his property and trading empire
30 years ago. An investor group controlled by Ronson family trusts will buy
24 service stations from Heron. The investor group has not, however, been
allowed to buy the Heron Suzuki franchise.
Heron has also provided a further Pounds 100m of provisions against the
value of its Spanish property portfolio and foreign exchange losses.
As a result, the group's negative net worth, as of March 1992, rose to
Pounds 328m from positive net assets of Pounds 585m in March 1991. After the
debt for equity swap, pro forma net assets were about Pounds 10m, but will
have fallen further.
Before the restructuring, the company's value had been hit by: a Pounds 300m
write-down in the European property portfolio, leaving it at about Pounds
700m, and Pounds 200m in US properties. A further Pounds 400m of reductions
includes Pounds 75m from UK housebuilding, which is up for sale; the
write-off of Heron's interest in Control Securities; the cost of cancelling
currency and interest rate swaps; and a Pounds 35m provision for the Pounds
50m cost of the restructuring.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: UK Safety Group reverses into Television
South West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SAFETY Group, the Bristol-based specialist shoe maker, is gaining a stock
market listing via a Pounds 9.5m reverse takeover deal with Television South
West, the former ITV franchise holder.
TSW's name will be changed to UK Safety, which was formed by a 1988
manage-ment buy-out of the foot-wear business of the Ward White Group.
Of the Pounds 9.5m acquisition price, Pounds 7.4m will be funded by a share
exchange involving 14.3m TSW shares at 51.7p apiece. A Pounds 2.1m dividend
will be paid to one of two Schroder buy-out funds, which currently hold 96
per cent of UK Safety. TSW is also raising about Pounds 1.5m via a 1-for-6
rights issue at 47p.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offers had been obtained from
sufficient numbers of UK Safety shareholders to ensure the acquisition, the
company said.
Schroders will hold about 38 per cent of the enlarged group and has promised
not to sell the shares for a year.
In 1992 UK Safety made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds
33.7m. It has about 26 per cent of the UK's Pounds 77m leather safety
footwear market.
TSW's results for 1992 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.2m, against Pounds
1.95m for the previous 17 months. Turnover amounted to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds
59.5m).
An Pounds 4.8m extraordinary charge related to a reassessment of property
assets and the discontinuation of its pension fund. Net assets per share
stood at 50.8p.
A proposed final dividend of 3p gives a total for the year of 5p (7p),
payable from earnings per share of 28.4p (5p).
Shares in TSW were suspended in January at 29p.

FT  10 APR 93 / Leyland Daf set for Pounds 4.8m boost: Government body ready
to supply part of finance needed for management buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent, DAVID OWEN and JOHN
GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT body is ready to provide a crucial part of the finance needed
for the proposed management buy-out of Leyland Daf's Birmingham van plant
from the receivers.
The cash injection, worth up to Pounds 4.8m, would come through a purchase
by Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation of land occupied by Leyland
Daf and on top of equity from 3i, the venture capital group, bank loans and
investment assistance from the government. Mr Jim Beeston, the corporation's
chief executive, refused to confirm the purchase, but noted that the
corporation had powers 'to buy land, to grant development aid, to improve
land and to support training initiatives'. The corporation is a statutory
body charged with the economic regeneration of the east Birmingham area
where Leyland Daf's Washwood Heath plant is situated.
Mr Beeston said its board had concluded that it could not afford to spend a
large part of its Pounds 5m annual budget, which it receives from the
Environment Department, on Leyland Daf. However, he said he expected an
announcement 'at the end of next week or the following week', implying that
the corporation would receive government funds to buy the land over the next
few days.
Mr Ken Ogilvy, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountant assembling finance for
the buy-out team, said he was expecting a formal offer to purchase land. The
buy-out team is expected to take control on April 19.
Whitehall funding is one of three main elements in the financial package put
together for the buy-out team, led by Mr Allan Amey, to purchase the
Washwood Heath plant from Arthur Andersen, the Leyland Daf receiver. The
other two are equity from a consortium led by 3i and borrowings provided by
an undisclosed UK bank.
A further element of the official funding is to be an unknown amount of
regional selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry.
This assistance, under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1982, has
to be used for capital projects and is normally drawn down in instalments
dependent on the progress of the project.
Although readiness to provide cash for Leyland Daf demonstrates the
government's expressed desire to support manufacturing industry, such
funding is rare from a government which has preferred to allow market forces
to settle the destiny of failed companies.
In February, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, ruled out
government finance to meet losses at the plant, but said assistance would be
available for capital projects.
The land in question covers about 40 acres of the 105 acres occupied by
Leyland Daf at Washwood Heath, said Mr Ogilvy. It was originally intended
for the company's Excel van joint venture with Renault, the French vehicle
manufacturer, which was scrapped after Leyland Daf called in receivers.
The corporation had had the land independently valued and would not be
paying more than the receiver would have been able to obtain, Mr Ogilvy
said.
He would not disclose the size of the deal, but property analysts believe
the land, given the contamination likely after 70 years of industrial use,
is not worth more than Pounds 120,000 an acre. This points to an overall
purchase price of up to Pounds 4.8m.
The van plant has enough orders to keep production going for the next six
weeks. Mr Ogilvy said many companies had been holding off placing orders.
'They won't sanction the orders until they know they are not buying an
obsolete vehicle,' he added.
Production has been scaled down by the receivers to 200 vehicles a week and
the workforce cut by over half to 1,000. 'There are no more planned
redundancies,' said Mr Ogilvy.
The immediate future is clouded by Automotive Products' suspension of clutch
and brake systems deliveries to the plant. The company has been in dispute
with the receiver about the non-payment of bills. The van plant has enough
components for only three days of production next week.
However, a willingness to resolve the issue has been evident in talks
between Automotive Products and the receiver and between the management
buy-out team and Automotive Products.
David Owen adds: The expected cash injection will add to suspicions that Mr
Heseltine, fresh from securing Commons' approval for his coal white paper,
may be ready to give his interventionist instincts freer rein.
Earlier this week, Mr Richard Needham, a trade and industry minister,
unveiled plans to encourage British companies to work closer together in
bidding for large projects in foreign markets, as part of a wide-ranging
effort to boost UK exports.
The Labour party, which this week published its own detailed proposals for
reversing the UK's manufacturing decline, has repeatedly used the Leyland
Daf collapse and the government's reaction to it to taunt Mr Heseltine over
his promise to last year's Conservative party conference to help British
industry.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, last month called on the government to
demonstrate its commitment to British manufacturing by ensuring a future for
Leyland Daf.
John Griffiths adds: The UK receivers and Daf Trucks NV, the new company
running Leyland Daf's former parent in Holland, said yesterday they had
jointly established a sales company, Leyland Daf Trucks, to market trucks
built by both the Dutch operation and Leyland Daf's trucks plant in
Lancashire. Leyland Daf Vans has already been established for the Birmingham
vans operation.

FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Can your stocks rise in the east? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL THE motto of the 21st century be 'go east, young man'? A fortnight ago,
this column suggested that emerging stock markets and European bonds were
two of the more interesting investment areas at the moment.
My reasoning was really more a process of elimination than anything more
sophisticated. But the entertaining fund management market double act, Tim
Guinness and Howard Flight of Guinness Flight, have an interesting argument
that enthusiasm for bonds and the Far Eastern markets are subtly linked.
Their case is that the high cost economies of the West are losing out to the
low cost economies of the Far East. As the West purchases its exports and
sources its manufacturing in the East, this results in low inflation - good
for bonds - and high Far Eastern economic growth - good for equities in that
region.
Like any good fund management group, the pair believe they have the answer:
a Hong Kong fund. The Hong Kong market is the entry point into China, which
has around a fifth of the world's population and an economy growing at 9 per
cent per year. The World Bank has forecast that China will be the world's
largest economy by 2003.
Hong Kong is on a price-earnings ratio of just 12.5, well below the ratings
awarded to other emerging markets. Thus, Guinness Flight argues, this is an
opportunity to invest in a large emerging economy on a cheap rating and they
are discounting the initial charge on the fund to persuade investors to take
the leap.
It is a good story, but one should mention the other side. The Hong Kong
market is highly volatile and has enjoyed a very sharp rise since the panic
caused by Tiananmen Square. With all the current political tension, there is
always the risk of a setback and a big question mark hangs over the colony's
future after 1997.
Although China's economy is growing fast, it still, as a nominally communist
country, does not have the same accounting standards or business practices
as in developed markets. On the level of individual stocks - even when
channelled via Hong Kong - it is hard to be sure exactly what you are
buying.
So this is definitely a risk area of investment - not the first home for
your redundancy money. It is really for those who are prepared to invest on
a 10 year basis - and then only with a limited portion of their portfolio.
And of course, one could be convinced by the case for Hong Kong, without
being sure that Guinness Flight is the right firm to manage it. Its offshore
fund is small at Dollars 3.2m and lacks a long-term record - although its
1992 performance did feature in a Best of the Best table in the US-based
Barrons magazine.
In my view, large investors might well consider having a portion (no more
than 5 per cent) of their portfolios in Hong Kong; small investors should
stick to the regional funds with a wider geographical spread.
*****
Now the first quarter is over, readers might like an update on the O'Higgins
Theory, which we featured at the start of the year. This was developed by a
US fund manager called Michael O'Higgins and involved selecting the ten
highest yielding stocks in the Dow Industrial index, and selecting from
those the five with the lowest nominal prices. You buy those five, hold them
for a year, and then repeat the process. He had shown this to be a means of
beating the Dow Index over the long term.
I found the theory appeared to work for the FT-30 Index, with a portfolio of
the five stocks easily beating the All-Share over the period 1979-92. So,
with risk warnings, I reported that, on January 2, the stocks selected by
the theory were Blue Circle, British Gas, Forte, Hanson, Lucas.
To date, the news has been quite good. Datastream figures show that, as of
yesterday, the O'Higgins portfolio has beaten the All-Share in purely
capital terms. The bad news is that neither return is very exciting - 2.1
per cent from the portfolio against 1.6 per cent from the All-Share.
Of course, if you repeated the process now, the theory might throw up
different stocks, so the above list is certainly not a recommendation. But
the article provoked so much reader response that I shall try to monitor the
portfolio's progress during the year.
*****
Finally, a note on Personal Equity Plan charges. Hoare Govett has produced a
guide to single company Peps, the kind that allows you to invest Pounds
3,000 in a stock on top of your general Pep allowance.
The Budget change in Advance Corporation Tax reduced the tax break of Peps
for basic rate investors. Hoare Govett says for a company yielding 4 per
cent, the annual tax benefit of a single company Pep to a basic rate
taxpayer has fallen from Pounds 14.38 to Pounds 6.38. This allows for an
annual management charge of 0.5 per cent plus VAT.
But if the share yields below 2.9 per cent, the tax saving is wiped out
altogether. And even at 4 per cent the tax break could be lost if the
manager imposes any kind of annual charge. Higher rate taxpayers and those
who regularly pay capital gains tax should still be well ahead.

FT  10 APR 93 / Man in the news: Tough test for the nation's headmaster -
John Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten waited nearly 13 years to get his big job. Perhaps he was
promoted too soon. For more than a decade the man who today revels in the
title of secretary of state for education sat fretting as the
under-secretary for this and the minister of state for that while others of
his generation or thereabouts whizzed past him. They entered the cabinet
room of No 10 Downing Street. He waited outside. The list of those who
scaled the heights before his own elevation is lengthy: William Waldegrave,
Chris Patten, John Major, Michael Howard, Peter Lilley, David Mellor. There
is no evidence that John Patten regarded any of them as his intellectual
superior.
At long last, after the April 1992 election, he was made what he likes to
call, only half in jest, 'the nation's headmaster'. One year later he seems
about to preside over a period of chaos in the nation's schools. He has
painted himself into a corner. Everyone seems to be against him - teachers,
their trade unions, some parents and school governors, even the Thatcherites
and right-wing think-tankers who provided the original motivating force for
setting up a national curriculum and a system of testing.
By no means all of this is Mr Patten's fault. The unwieldiness of the
national curriculum and its associated assessments of pupil progress were
built-in by his predecessors. The original framework, set out in Mr Kenneth
Baker's seminal 1988 Education Act, was worked upon by civil servants and
educationists and made so complicated as to contain the seeds of its own
possible self-destruction. Yet it has been Mr Patten's job to persuade
teachers of the merits of the government's education reforms. From the start
he appeared to shrink from that task, preferring to rest on the authority of
the law, the dignity of his office, and his commendable decision to send his
daughter to a state school.
Immediately after his appointment he went into hiding. He emerged to visit
schools, but he resisted meetings with the teachers' powerful trade unions.
He huddled with his civil servants, but hoarded the time available to
outside advisers. A colleague of his, a close friend, explains that the
secretary for education is rather shy. Perhaps he is. To outsiders who see
him on television he seems affected, sometimes pompous. In close-up, in
private, he is affable, witty, a healthily ambitious minister of unproven
ability in a cabinet in which few are outstanding and most are grey. Yet the
bedding-down of the Baker reforms is one of the most important tasks on the
government's agenda. It can only be accomplished by a minister of
outstanding ability.
Mr Patten's qualifications for this historic post remain unproven. He
belongs to neither of the two tribes associated in the popular mind with
Conservative politicians. He is not an aristocrat; nor is he one of the
self-made newly-rich. The son of a gardener, he became a lecturer at Oxford,
a piece of personal history that he likes to cite as evidence of his
suitability for his present position. He regards himself as an intellectual,
although his musings and writings on the British constitution suggest that
on that topic at least he does not have an original thought in his head. A
devout Roman Catholic and family man, he is, as he cheerfully confesses,
able to live decently enough on the combined earnings of himself and his
wife, a successful management consultant. To his credit, he believes in the
application of moral principles to public affairs.
When he was minister of state at the Home Office he was able to go to his
nearby flat for lunch. Perhaps he should have stayed at his desk, nibbled at
a sandwich, and sought to refine the clauses in the criminal justice bill
that are now under attack by both the police and the judiciary.
Political life is unfair: a junior minister (as he then was) should not be
held responsible for an important piece of legislation, but Mr Patten's
detractors are now reminding us that he piloted the bill through the House
of Commons. The resulting legislation has been widely criticised for its
laxity towards persistent young offenders.
This weekend his mettle is being tested as never before. Other ministers
before him have wrestled public sector interest-groups to the ground: Mr
Kenneth Clarke roughed up both the teachers and the medical profession and
got away with it; when Mr Baker came to office the teachers were on strike.
He saw them off. Mr Waldegrave was the subject of much public ridicule
during his period as secretary for health, but the National Health Service
reforms went ahead. The difference in Mr Patten's case is that the
government itself is held in uniquely low esteem, the Conservatives'
majority in parliament is slim, and the minister appears to have no allies.
That could change. On Wednesday the previously inflexible secretary for
education promised a thorough review of both the curriculum and the tests,
bowing to the general demand for simplification. He did, however, insist
that this year's tests go ahead: the review comes in 1994. It was as near to
a complete roll-over as could be expected from any minister, yet the unions
are saying it is not enough.
Mr Patten therefore appears to be in a trap. He can make further
concessions, and scrap the 1993 tests. That would put paid to his
credibility as a minister. Alternatively, he can stand firm and risk a
chaotic summer in the schools. He may play for time, awaiting the outcome of
an appeal by Wandsworth council against last week's court ruling that the
boycott of tests proposed by one of the teaching unions is lawful. A higher
court could rescue him. Failing that, he might try a rushed change in the
law to declare boycotts illegal. The trouble is that he could not be certain
of getting that through an unpredictable House of Commons.
There is one other possibility. The teachers' unions may well overreach
themselves. A public opinion that was broadly sympathetic when Mr Patten was
clearly inflexible might turn around when he is seen to be the reasonable
one and the union leaders are plainly going too far. His offer of a complete
review partly based on the experience gained in this year's tests makes
sense. They should therefore go ahead. If he proves able enough, and lucky
enough, to turn the public against the unions he will save the curriculum,
testing, and his own reputation.

FT  10 APR 93 / Group 4 loses third prisoner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S first private prisoner escort service on Thursday experienced its
third escape within a week, Robert Taylor writes.
A 20-year-old man facing traffic charges in Derby escaped by breaking out of
the van taking him to court.
Group 4 Escort Services started work last week on a five-year contract
covering the east midlands, south and north Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and
Humberside. Mr David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers
Association, yesterday predicted further escapes: 'This recurring nightmare
will go on as long as this government continues with its dogmatic policy of
contracting out prison escorting.'
The prison service, which is monitoring Group 4's operation, acknowledged
'significant difficulties' and said it would be discussing the problems with
Group 4 next week.
The company said that 'initial difficulties' could be expected. 'Our
procedures and our vehicles are entirely to the satisfaction of the Home
Office who also set the standards for the prison service.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Anglo-Scottish water pipeline mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, may study the
feasibility of building a privately funded pipeline to carry water from
southern Scotland and northern England to the drought-prone south of
England.
The pipeline, which could take 12 years to construct and would involve a
140-mile tunnel through the Pennines, might cost Pounds 1.5bn. But with
water a sensitive subject in Scotland - as the Scottish Office considers the
possibility of privatising the country's water industry - the idea has
already run into opposition.
Scottish Enterprise may contribute Pounds 500,000 to a two-year study of the
project. Consulting engineer Mott MacDonald is understood to be interested,
as is Bank of America, which is involved in financing other UK
infrastructure projects.
The scheme would involve taking water from the rivers Nith, Dee and Annan in
south-west Scotland, then gathering water from the rivers Eden and Esk in
north-west England before going to the Kielder reservoir in Northumbria. The
pipeline would then pass through a 140-mile tunnel to Carsington near Derby,
where it would link with the water supply system for East Anglia and
south-east England.
In Scotland the pipeline could be extended to bring in water from the river
Tay in the southern Highlands.
The Scottish Office is still considering the future of Scottish water and
sewerage, currently run by local authorities. Most observers believe that it
is not feasible to create water companies and privatise them before the next
election.

FT  10 APR 93 / US jets bomb Iraqi guns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US AIRCRAFT patrolling Iraq's northern no-fly zone yesterday bombed an
anti-aircraft battery. The US said the Iraqi guns had fired on the aircraft,
but the Baghdad regime denied this.
The incident is the first US-Iraqi military confrontation since January 20,
President Bill Clinton's inauguration day, when US aircraft bombed an Iraqi
radar after a series of clashes in the last days of the Bush administration.
However, French jets patrolling the no-fly zone were fired on in February.
US officials appeared inclined to assume the latest incident was an isolated
one, unless a pattern of provocation develops over the next few days, as has
often happened in the past. There were no immediate US plans to summon
Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations to complain.
Pentagon officials said four US aircraft - three F-16s and one F-4G - were
on a routine patrol yesterday in the no-fly zone, set up by the UN to
protect the region's Kurdish people from air attack by the regime of
President Saddam Hussein.
After they had been fired on, the aircraft dropped bombs on the
anti-aircraft battery, then returned safely to their base at Encirlik in
Turkey.
Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the US remained
committed to enforce both the northern no-fly zone and the similar zone in
southern Iraq intended to protect the mainly Shia marsh Arabs. 'Iraq
understands clearly what its obligations are in regard to the no-fly zone
and will be held solely responsible for the serious consequences of failure
to comply with these obligations,' Mr Boucher said.
The Iraqi governor of the region said the US aircraft had dropped cluster
bombs even though the Iraqi guns - guarding a dam - had not fired.

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S President Lee Teng-hui said yesterday that the island would mount a
campaign to rejoin the United Nations, from which it was ousted by China in
1971, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'We will actively seek to join the United Nations. We hope the international
community will seriously consider this issue within three years,' he said in
a speech at the opening of a session of the National Assembly. 'We will push
to join more international organisations in order to contribute to the peace
and prosperity of the world.'
Taiwan has applied for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, and has said it wants to join several other multilateral economic
organisations.
International pressure forced Taiwan to give up its seat in the UN to China,
which has claimed sovereignty over the island since the end of the Chinese
civil war in 1949.
But Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which made strong
gains in last December's elections, wants Taipei to re-apply for UN
membership immediately and has staged demonstrations to press its demand.

<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS who hoped President Bill Clinton would keep his pledge to
buy more land for the nation's parks will be disappointed by the budget,
writes Lisa Bransten in Washington.
Spending on land acquisition will fall to Dollars 77.6m (Pounds 51.3m) from
the Dollars 117.9m allocated in 1993. Overall, however, the Interior
Department budget increases by more than Dollars 500m to Dollars 9.5bn.
Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said his department opted to maintain
and improve existing national parks rather than acquire new land. He hopes
to continue increasing land held by national parks through land swaps with
other Interior Department bureaux.
The department aims to press ahead with plans to raise fees for grazing
livestock and mining hard rock minerals on federal land, although Mr Clinton
bowed to congressional pressure and took them out of the budget itself.
Mr Babbitt said he had the administrative authority to increase grazing fees
and planned to press Congress to increase mining fees by at least 8 per
cent.

FT  10 APR 93 / Russia warns on new Serbia sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia warned
yesterday that tighter sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be
counter-productive.
A draft resolution on sanctions is due to be debated by the UN security
council on Monday. It is aimed at stopping and checking all traffic along
the Danube, closing several border crossings between Serbia and its
neighbours, banning all shipping in Yugoslavia's territorial waters, and
seizing what remains of the country's assets abroad.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, said any new
sanctions, intended as pressure by the international community to force the
Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen, would have the opposite effect.
'This would be an untimely and harmful step,' he said, after talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the
rump Yugoslavia, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader. Mr Churkin
added that the conflict in Bosnia 'would escalate', implying that the
Bosnian Serbs were determined to continue fighting regardless of
international pressure.
However, Mr Nikola Koljevic, a senior Bosnian Serb leader, said new
proposals made by Mr Churkin would be acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. He
said the Russian plan envisaged amending the shape of the Bosnian map drawn
up by the international peace negotiators.
The map, accepted by Bosnia's Croats and Moslems, entails dividing the
republic into ten autonomous provinces, largely on ethnic lines. But the
Bosnian Serbs have steadfastly refused to accept the boundaries because the
map does not give them full control of eastern Bosnia, a crucial bridge for
linking Serb-held territories in south-west Croatia with Serbia proper.
The US indicated yesterday it wanted an early UN vote on sanctions, despite
Russian misgivings. But the US, Britain and France have been anxious not to
press Moscow too hard before the referendum on April 25, when Russians will
decide how they should be ruled.
Agencies report: The value of the Yugoslav dinar, drastically eroded by
inflation and sanctions, has been set by the Belgrade government at 48,000
to the US dollar. The previous official exchange rate had been 750 dinars to
the dollar.

FT  10 APR 93 / Clinton seeks Gatt fast-track extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration asked Congress yesterday to move swiftly to grant it
eight more months to complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under
an extension of the vital 'fast-track' negotiating authority.
The request would allow President Bill Clinton to notify Congress no later
than December 15 that he intends to enter a Uruguay Round agreement before
April 15 1994. In giving 'fast-track' authority, Congress must vote for or
against a Gatt package as a whole and not try to amend it.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said in Brussels: 'This is
excellent news for the Uruguay Round. . . The time allowed is sufficiently
long for the remaining negotiations to take place but sufficiently short for
it to put the necessary pressure on all concerned.'
While the eight-month extension request was expected, there was surprise
that the White House was seeking a 'clean' fast-track bill with no
amendments. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had previously
indicated no objection to attaching additional tough 'market-opening'
measures.
But an official said that, 'given the urgency of the Round,' the
administration decided the fast-track request should 'not be encumbered' by
more controversial legislation.

FT  10 APR 93 / German airmen set for Bosnian role
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN air force crews were yesterday preparing to join their Nato allies in
enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia, following a decision by Germany's
constitutional court to clear their involvement in military operations
outside the Nato area.
The court's decision, immediately welcomed by Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato
secretary-general, ends for the moment a dispute in the coalition government
about the legality of allowing German troops to serve outside Nato.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union had insisted that the
constitution did not prevent Germans serving in combat roles outside Nato.
But the liberal Free Democrat party, junior coalition partner, which
politically supports the CDU in deploying German troops outside Nato
territory, wanted the constitutional court to decide whether deployment
would be legal.
Article 24 of the constitution allows German troops to fight alongside Nato
allies. But until recently successive governments had interpreted the
section to mean German troops were to be confined to combat within the Nato
area.
Instead of tackling the constitutional issue head-on, the court, in what
amounts to a temporary ruling, said Germany's credibility as a reliable
partner in Nato, and its international standing, would be undermined if
Germans were withdrawn from the Awacs reconnaissance operations.
The issue of whether it would require a constitutional amendment to deploy
German troops in combat outside Nato territory in other circumstances has
been postponed.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and a Free Democrat, said 'our soldiers
have clear legal backing and that's the decisive point.' But the reputation
of the Free Democrats has been damaged by the affair. Its decision to refer
the issue to the constitutional court had virtually paralysed the government
and provoked widespread criticism about Germany's inability to play a
responsible role in the post-Cold War era.
The opposition Social Democratic party, which has its own internal divisions
on Germany's military role outside the Nato area, said it would challenge
the court's decision.

<TEXT>
ALL THE PRETTY HORSES
by Cormac McCarthy
Picador Pounds 14.99, 302 pages
ANYONE who has read any of Cormac McCarthy's previous novels, particularly
Blood Meridian, his Odyssey through the badlands of the American West, will
already know the frisson his writing can generate and the sheer force his
imagery musters. Yet there is no prior knowledge that could anticipate the
searing achievement of All the Pretty Horses. In a single giant stride it
takes McCarthy to the forefront of contemporary American fiction.
The origins of McCarthy's art, in William Faulkner and Hemingway, are easy
enough to discern: his prose has a compulsive directness, a descriptive
virtuosity which wastes not a single word. Now, though, comparisons and
antecedents are made to seem irrelevant. The voice is manifestly a unique
and powerful one, the world it inhabits has been made entirely its own.
There is something almost transcendental about McCarthy's descriptive
virtuosity, a compulsion to observe and record coupled with an awestruck
sense of natural beauty which seems to link him more closely to the American
nature writers - to Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, even Annie Dillard -
than to any of his novelist contemporaries.
For if literature ceded the American West to the cinema three-quarters of a
century ago, McCarthy is now reclaiming it. The evocations of the
borderlands of Texas and Mexico in the late 1940s resonate around the
protagonists of All the Pretty Horses until landscape and character, even
speech, become the equal components of a seamless, endlessly variegated
texture.
John Grady Cole is the grandson of a Texas rancher, the last, losing
generation of a dynasty that has seen its grip on the land progressively
weakened. When his father, back from the war, opts to give up ranching for
life in the town, John Grady escapes south to recover the cowboy life; with
his friend Lacey Rawlins he sets off in search of the dream of the old
America. As they cross into Mexico they meet up with a younger absconder,
Blevins, the last issue of another old West lineage, the outlaw. After
Blevins steals back his escaped horse the three youths are forced to split
up and the older two find their way to a Mexican ranch which seems to be the
very lost arcadia they had set out to find.
The lyrical centrepiece of McCarthy's book is a loving description of the
two boys' life on the ranch as working cowhands, luminous in its details of
the enchanted world as the boys perceive it. When cruel reality intrudes
again - Blevins is caught as a horsestealer and Grady and Cole are
implicated too - the unblinking force of the book does not waver. The
inhumanities of prison life are portrayed just as vividly as the lyric
interludes. Grady emerges from his ordeal forcibly matured, yet clinging to
his own moral code of loyalty and courage through which he can survive the
institutionalised horror.
Not the least considerable of McCarthy's achievements is to make the
narrative as spell-binding as his descriptive flights. One remembers the
harsh beauties of the book - the image of song birds impaled by a storm on
the spines of a cactus, the hymn-like celebrations of the natural grace of
horses in an unforgiving landscape - but also the corrosive tale and the
moral imperative it conveys. Everything, too, is wonderfully proportioned;
all the strands are perfectly integrated, without any spare flesh. For once
a jacket blurb has got it absolutely right: All the Pretty Horses, it says,
'is indisputably a masterpiece'.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Get off my show] - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST thing you learn as presenter of Feedback, the correspondence
column of the air on BBC Radio 4, is that radio is woven into the lives of
the listeners in a way that television never has been and probably never can
be. You have to sit down to watch television, and if someone moves Minder
from 9.00 to 8.00 pm it may annoy you, but it makes little difference to
your life. However, if broadcasters change the running order of the Today
programme in even the smallest way they interfere with the morning ritual of
shave/shower/breakfast or dress/cook/shop.
Move Woman's Hour from the afternoon to the morning and you play havoc with
a woman's daily routine and spoil her coffee break. It is made abundantly
clear to the Feedback presenter that when radio chiefs do change the
schedules, listeners feel as though someone has walked uninvited into their
home and rearranged the furniture. They write not in irritation but
incandescent with fury asking 'Whose radio channel do they think this is?'
implying a possessiveness that nobody feels for a television network. It is
probably radio's greatest strength.
The second thing you realise is that 99 per cent of people only write when
angry. This results in a phenomenon which, early on in the job, I named
'Kaleidoscope Syndrome'. Radio 4 controller Michael Green decided that
instead of running the arts magazine Kaleidoscope solely in the evening, he
would originate it in the afternoon and give it an evening repeat. From all
over the country I was inundated with vituperation.
'Get this artsy-fartsy metropolitan rubbish off my radio,' snorted one,
'while I'm ploughing here outside Diss I do not want to know what that
effete crowd are getting up to in London'. The programme was condemned as a
hotbed of homosexuality (there had been two vaguely gay items in the first
10 days) and heaped with scorn: what was the point in listening if you could
not get to the theatres and galleries reviewed? The letters came from north
and south, men and women, young and old, and there were no counterbalancing
expressions of welcome. It was clear that Feedback had to record this
hostile reaction.
Having done so I was cascaded with letters saying 'Hold on a moment, we like
hearing about the London arts scene here in Alloa/Beccles/Cardiff. It's true
we cannot get up to town very often but that is exactly why we need
Kaleidoscope to keep us abreast of things. Hands off]' Others said there was
far too little about gay matters anywhere in the mass media. Such letters
eventually outnumbered the hostile variety, yet I doubt if any would have
been written had those listeners not been enraged by the initial attack.
People who are content with what they hear rarely bother to write, though
they may well be in the majority.
Yet listeners - and this is Lesson 3 - tend to believe, as soon as they hear
three or more other people expressing views which endorse their own that
'Everyone agrees . . . ' Having heard three letters saying that Any
Questions is now merely a political dogfight, and should be changed back to
the old civilised discourse between intelligent non-political all-rounders,
they write to Feedback asking 'Why oh why does the BBC persist so stubbornly
in this idiocy when they have been told repeatedly that everybody dislikes
it?' This was the pattern with the Woman's Hour move from afternoon to
morning and with the change in Any Answers from a letters programme to a
phone-in, both of which produced numerous hostile letters.
When I discovered that in both cases the changes had resulted in enlarged
audiences, and said so, I received sceptical letters asking 'Who says the
audience is bigger? Who is doing the counting?' and claiming darkly 'I've
never met anyone who has been polled by the BBC', as though the writers
really believed that the BBC was determined to lower its ratings and then
lie about them.
And the favourite Feedback topics? This season it has been the plan to use
Radio 4's long-wave frequency for a continuous news channel, leaving the
familiar mixture (Letter From America, Desert Island Discs, Gardener's
Question Time) solely on FM. The proposal is opposed passionately not only
by users of portable radios and car drivers all over Britain, who have
difficulty getting clear FM signals, but by many in continental Europe who
are able to receive Radio 4 only on long wave.
However, in the long term the matters which attract most letters are The
Archers, the world's longest running soap opera and a series which could
easily sustain a weekly correspondence programme on its own (Ruth's howling
baby is currently causing the Feedback postman's back to bend, with the
breast-feeders up in arms about the poor little mite being given a bottle),
and English useage. One day I intend offering Radio 4 a series to be called
'Less Mistakes In English' sub-titled 'A New Criteria: Different To All
Previous Series'. Only one thing infuriates the English pedant more than a
change which has crept into English useage between his childhood and today -
and that is hearing it on BBC radio.

<TEXT>
MR MANI
by A B Yehoshua
Peter Halban Pounds 15.99, 368 pages
ADJECTIVES come racing to mind to describe Mr Mani, for instance 'rich,
complex, exotic, creative, informative', but 'easy' is one that does not
fit. On finishing it, this reader had the reaction that he had to turn back
to the beginning in order to grasp more firmly the sources of his
admiration.
A B Yehoshua has hit upon an original way of telling what in former days
might have been a three-decker family tale of the Thomas Mann or Galsworthy
type. Depicting ten generations of the Mani family, Yehoshua chooses to
unfold the story backwards, from a young Israeli woman in the present
bringing up the latest Mani, a boy whose father has been killed on active
service in Lebanon.
Behind her and this boy stands a grandfather who is a judge, and behind him
stands an elder Mani who was in Crete with his family at the time of the
German invasion in 1941, and who did not survive the Nazis. Behind him
stands his father, who had been in Palestine when the British captured it in
1917, and had been treated as a spy and deported to Crete. And behind him
stands a previous generation which travelled between Poland and Jerusalem.
In this way the roots of the Manis are traced to a forebear in the Jewish
quarter of Salonika in the 18th century.
By the fictional standards of today it might have seemed unacceptably old
hat to give a straightforward narrative even of so unusual a lot as the
Manis. It is also a brilliantly oblique method of telling the entire recent
history of the Jews, of course, with the one diaspora in Europe and the
other in the lands of the former Ottoman empire meeting now in the modern
state of Israel, and not always smoothly as a new identity arises.
Yehoshua sweeps in an enormous cast of characters, beginning with wise
rabbis and Jewish doctors and villagers in eastern Europe, going on to Dr
Herzl himself at a Zionist Congress in Basel, taking in the British consul
and British army officers and people who ran a clinic in Jerusalem, Ottoman
Beirut, Turks and Arabs and Jews of all sorts. Such a display of learning
and command of historical detail might have been intimidating, but the touch
is far too light and natural for that.
As for the Manis, they survive without giving any sense that they realise
how special they are. As a family they have more than their fair share of
suicide and illegitimacy. History brings them tragedy and murder. Their
personal dramas count for more than anything symbolic which Yehoshua may
have intended for them as representatives of Jewish fate. It is
extraordinarily skilful to have captured the Jewish mixture of suffering and
revival, despair and messianic hope, without in any way spelling out such
heavy themes.
Which brings us to technique, a subject of concern to writers rather than
readers, but inescapable in this case. Yehoshua has chosen to arrange the
novel in the form of five lengthy conversations, so that the saga is not
necessarily carried forward (or backward) by those directly living it, but
instead through the mouth of someone convenient for the purpose: the mother
of the last Mani boy, the German soldier who killed the Mani in Crete and so
on.
The supposed interlocutor is missing. The conversations are therefore so
many interior monologues. On the one hand this allows Yehoshua to range far
and wide, but on the other it proves extremely cryptic because it is
one-sided. The reader is often left to puzzle out what the missing person is
supposed to have said, and Yehoshua delights in setting traps.
I cannot imagine what else Yehoshua could have done, but imposing this
structure on himself makes for harder work than need have been the case, and
raises an awkward question of verisimilitude: if one side of these
conversations has been recorded, how come the other has not?
In the future, as this book takes its rightful place, seminars and
doctorates will thrash out that point. Let me now add 'creative, wild,
exemplary, life-enhancing and even optimistic' to the list of adjectives.

FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: Lights on a winter night - David Pilling visits the
arctic circle in search of illumination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TROMSO. Arctic Norway. 3pm. Pitch black. I leant back and gazed. This was
exactly what I had come to see: the Northern Lights, the aurora borealis,
flickering against a huge sky.
Things had begun in the north-west. A few green bands, like slats of
Venetian blind, had appeared above the horizon. Dimming momentarily, they
returned stronger than before, spiralling outwards and showering waves of
phosphorescence across the night. Trees, which had been enveloped in
blackness, revealed gaunt silhouettes against a glowering green expanse.
The technician, a burly Norwegian, snapped on the lights to illuminate the
domed planetarium ceiling on to which the aurora borealis had been
projected. The real Northern Lights were outside, but were obscured by cloud
cover.
The planetarium opened in 1989 to satisfy tourist cravings for the Arctic's
most famous phenomenon. If the real lights were playing hard to get, at
least these were reliable.
On one occasion, he said, a group had emerged blinking from the planetarium
just in time to witness one of the most spectacular displays of the aurora
borealis in years. Many visitors are not so lucky. The Northern Lights
remain elusive, even here in the world's northernmost city at the heart of
their most active zone.
I went in late January. Tromso was just emerging from two months of total
darkness, a period when many people, ironically, find it almost impossible
to sleep.
Judging by the packed and numerous bars, the city's sleep-deprived
multitudes take solace in Arctic beer - brewed, according to the can, in the
world's most northerly brewery. At Pounds 4 a pint, it was certainly
approaching the most elevated prices.
Many Tromsonians attribute mystical qualities to the Northern Lights.
Children often wave at the natural firework show, in spite of parental
warnings that this invites the lights to carry them away.
I was getting carried away, myself, but not by the lights. I had given up on
the aurora borealis and had turned my attention to the attractions of Tromso
itself, a city of biscuit-tin-like picturesqueness.
January in Tromso is cold and snowy, but not as chilling as one would
imagine for a city on the 70th parallel. My flight from London, via Oslo,
took four hours. A similar journey south would have landed me in Timbuktu.
There was an extraordinary muffled silence about Tromso, blanketed as it was
in snow. The only sound was the trickle of water and the occasional crash of
melting ice slipping from clapboard houses and pin-sharp church steeples.
From my bedroom in the Hotel With (with what I wondered) I could make out
the cobweb-thin bridge separating Tromso from the mainland. In the dark, the
spindly structure vanished from sight and car headbeams appeared to float
slowly over the black watery divide. On the mainland was Tromso cathedral
(yes, the world's most northerly), a peculiar girdered affair like the
rib-cage of a whale. Mountains stared starkly behind.
I had quite forgotten the Northern Lights by now as I padded and skidded
across the tiny city centre, sliding from bar to bar. I even squeezed in a
visit to the Polar Museum, which occupied my attention for several hours -
saving me a small fortune in beers.
Inntravel (0439-71111) organises Northern Lights packages departing every
Thursday in January and February, returning Sunday. The weekend, including
scheduled flights on SAS and accommodation at Hotel With, costs Pounds 399.
Accommodation is nominally b &amp; b, but residents can help themselves to
coffee and pancakes during the day and a smorgasbord in the evening
(worthwhile in view of exorbitant restaurant prices).
The Northern Lights, caused by high-speed solar particles hitting the
earth's magnetic field, are visible on clear, dark nights between 7pm and
3am. In January and February, you stand roughly a 50 per cent chance of
seeing them.

AS A holiday destination, Lemnos has not had a very good press. A large
island about 30 miles off the Turkish coast, its scenery is not particularly
spectacular, and it has few ancient remains. It is garrisoned by several
thousand Greek troops, and the military presence is always evident, though
as compensation there is a decent road from one end of the island to
another.
Its small metropolis, Myrina, is a bustling town crowned by the ruins of a
massive medieval castle; its long, sandy beaches are far better than most,
and its countryside is well farmed and look prosperous.
Lemnos is not as well-known as the smaller and more obviously pretty Greek
islands. Yet until a century ago it was among the most famous, renowned as
the source of 'Lemnian earth', a cure-all for almost every conceiveable
disorder.
Dug from a hillside pit on the north side of the island, this magical
substance was made into small lozenges, which were exported all over the
Mediterranean. In the 2nd century AD, Galen, the Greek father of modern
medicine, made a special journey to Lemnos to investigate the earth. It was
believed to be effective against poison and snakebite. In the 16th century
Terra sigillata (sealed earth) or Terra Lemnia was used against dysentery
and the plague, and was so popular that quack doctors took the trouble to
fake it.
Until the end of the 19th century it was still dug and made into pills, as
described by the Rev Henry Fanshawe Tozer in his book on the Aegean islands,
published in 1890. Tozer was one of those Victorian clergymen who travelled
for months at a time - presumably leaving their curates in charge - - and
were happy to go anywhere.
He set out from Myrina with three hired horses and a guide, and took a
day-and-a-half to travel the 15 miles to the pit, shadowed by suspicious
Turkish soldiers.
In Galen's time, Tozer wrote, the earth was kneaded and moulded by the
priestess of the moon goddess Artemis, who was the only person allowed to
handle it. It was then divided into small pieces, each stamped with the seal
of the goddess. Under Christianity the ritual took on Christian overtones.
In Tozer's time it was overseen by the Turks, who still ruled the island.
The annual ritual, attended by about 3,000 islanders, took place on August 6
and was conducted by both Greek and Turkish priests. The earth had to be dug
before sunrise, otherwise it would lose its medicinal powers. The Turks
sacrificed a lamb, which they ate, while the Christians had to make do with
fish, as August 6 fell during a fast.
After a service recited by Orthodox monks, the mouth of the pit was cleared,
and five or six sacks were filled with the earth. They were handed to the
Turkish authorities, who sent most of the earth to the Sultan in
Constantinople, though the Greeks were allowed to keep a small proportion.
Last summer, armed with Tozer's book, I went in search of the pit. The
journey from Myrina today takes well under an hour, mainly along the
military road. Tozer described exactly where the pit was - below the summit
of a 200-ft hill, about a mile south of the village of Kotchino (today's
Kotsinas) and above a spring called Phtelidia.
I had no problem finding the spring: it has been diverted into a series of
drinking troughs and was in constant use. On the hillside above, I found all
sorts of thistle-filled hollows where the earth might have been dug.
But even in his day the farmer who owned the hill was threatening to plough
over the pit, and the quest was obviously hopeless. So I walked down the
hill again, had a swig of the marvellously fresh Phtelidia water and went
back to Kotsinas.
On my return to England, I tracked down a remnant Lemnian earth. It is
called simply 'Terra sigillata, ref 1939.956', and is kept in a drawer of
the Natural History Museum's mineralogy department. It is an insignificant
reddish cylinder about 1in across and  1/2 in deep, like a small terracotta
basin plug or a large Rolo. Its upper surface is stamped with the words
'Terra Lemna' (a mis-spelling for 'Lemnia'), with a crescent moon and three
stars above, and a pair of crossed palm branches below.
The Rev Tozer is dismissive about the earth's medical properties, quoting an
analysis that found it to consist of 'silex 66 per cent, alumina 14.5 per
cent, oxide iron 6 per cent, water 8.5 per cent, natron 3.5 per cent',
together with small quantities of lime and magnesia.

STANDING in the dark, deserted stairwell at 11 Bilkova Street I felt more
like a spy than the post-communism tourist I was, waiting for my Czech
hostess to arrive to make the pre-arranged hand-over: the keys of her Prague
apartment in exchange for a modest sum of foreign currency.
In planning my visit to Prague I capitalised on one of the fruits of the
Czech Republic's new found democracy, the right of Czech citizens to rent
their apartments to foreigners. Tourists now have an alternative to Prague's
high-priced, often over-booked hotels, and Czechs can earn extra income,
sometimes making half a month's salary in just a few days.
Prague straddles the Vltava River and is divided into 10 boroughs. Praha l,
with Prague Castle, Old Town (Stare Mesto) and Wenceslas Square, is where
most museums and historical sites are found, and was where I wanted to stay.
Consulting a map, I narrowed my choice to the charming streets of the Old
Town. After talking to apartment rental agencies in France and Prague I
booked a residence in the ancient Jewish quarter, close to the historic Old
Town Square.
I paid the France-based agent Pounds 20 and was told that all I had to do
was show up at the Prague address, pay the Pounds 55 balance to my hostess,
and the apartment was mine for four days.
I had followed instructions and found myself waiting nervously in the
darkening corridor. I started to worry. Had I made a mistake? What if no one
came? I stared out at the Baroque facades of neighbouring buildings and
heard the bells of St Vitus ringing from Castle Hill. It was 5pm. My Czech
hostess was late. I thought of the Hotel Intercontinental down the street,
and its Pounds 135-a-night price tag.
Happily, Madame Koudelkova appeared, apologizing for her 15-minute delay as
she welcomed me into her home. Using smiles and gestures to overcome our
lack of a common language, she gave me a tour of my new lodgings. I was
pleasantly surprised. The three-room apartment was spacious and clean, and
as I imagined: walls were covered with enviable artwork sketched no doubt by
friends, while a carved statue of a saint stood in one corner, facing a
shrine of even bigger dimension: the bookcase, where Dostoevsky shared space
with Goethe and Gogol.
Madame proudly pointed out both a shower and tub, with 24-hour hot water. I
noticed sound-proof windows in the sleeping area, where two twin beds were
fitted with fluffy cotton comforters. The large kitchen was decorated with
shiny red shelving stacked with international teas, evidence of guests
before me.
It is important to note that kitchens in Prague may prove perplexing to the
unaccustomed visitor. Ovens are small, refrigerators are frequently
half-size and amenities sparse: microwaves and toasters are practically
non-existent.
None of this proves a problem, unless, of course, it comes as a surprise. If
planning to cook in your rented apartment, or if traveling with children,
request an inventory of appliances beforehand. Some agencies, like Prague
Suites, can provide coffee-makers and televisons. They will also stock
groceries. It is a good idea to have at least water, bread and milk on hand
upon arrival.
Telephones are rare, but this is not a big problem as calls are made easily
from hotels and post offices 24 hours a day. However, rental agencies should
provide useful addresses including local hotels, taxi stands and medical
clinics which admit foreigners (such as Polyclinique, 32 Karlova namesti;
tel: 299-381).
Madame Koudelkova handed me her keys and we pantomimed our goodbyes before
she disappeared down the stairwell. I turned then to important matters.
Where exactly was I? My map showed Parizska Avenue nearby and, one street
down, the former home of Franz Kafka. Three blocks away was the 13th-century
Gothic Old-New Jewish Synagogue and, beyond, streets lined with antique and
crystal shops that led to the open-air market on the cobbled square.
I had an agenda and it began with dinner. A year ago I would have arrived in
Prague laden with survival food, but times have changed. Restaurants have
opened all over the city. I found delicious Czech-style trout and a good
Moravian wine at the charming U Zlate Hrusky (3 Novy Svet on Castle Hill).
Dinner for under Pounds 3 can still be had at vinarna (wine bars) as well as
pivnice (ale houses), where ham and garlic sausages go well with the famous
Czech beer.
U Supa (Celetna Street) has Purkmistr on tap, while U Fleku (9 Kremencova),
a German-style taverna, has been serving 13` Lezak since 1499. Pilsner
Urquell is the beer of choice at U Zlateho Tygra (17 Husova), a tavern
packed with goateed locals (good luck getting a seat).
Czech coffee is excellent, the sweet flaky pastries divine, and my
neighbourhood cafe lured me away from making my own breakfast each morning.
Afternoon tea at the old-world Hotel Europa was serenaded by waltzing
violins and the nights were filled with Baroque concerts or jazz at Club
Reduta.
I felt rather guilty not spending more time at my home-away-from-home on
Bilkova Street, but as I assured Madame Koudelkova in my parting thankyou
note, I would surely return.
Finding chez vous in Prague is made easy by asking the right questions.
Decide to stay in either a private apartment or bed-and-breakfast. Request a
map showing your rental's location. Inquire about noise, elevators, sleeping
arrangements, facilities and proximity to metros and trams.
Some of the agencies offering the largest selection of Prague rentals:
Top Tour (9 Rybna, Prague 1; tel: 42-2-232-1077; fax: 42-2-232-6126) offers
one-bedroom (two people) apartments at Pounds 46 nightly. No credit cards;
payment in local or hard currency upon arrival.
Prague Suites (8 Melantrichova, Prague 1; tel: 42-2-269-384; fax:
42-2-266-179) one-bedroom apartments start at Pounds 92 (includes
transportation to and from the airport and 24-hour concierge and maintenance
services).
In the UK, Mary and Francis Villas, a division of Time Off (Chester Close,
Belgravia, London SWlX 7BQ; tel: 071-235-8825; fax: 071-259-6093) offers
one-bedroom rentals for Pounds 48.
The France-based Chez Vous (47150, Lacapelle Biron, tel: 33-53-40-85-54;
fax: 33-53-40-86-30) takes requests (English, French) within Europe for
Prague-based agencies (including Top Tour). One-bedroom apartments: Pounds
45.

FT  10 APR 93 / Travel: Soothing luxury of the 'real' Bali
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a type of travel writer who is always rushing about, harum-scarum,
in search of 'reality' - the 'real' France, the 'real' Mexico, the 'real'
Indonesian island.
As a rule, they distrust and dislike anything remotely modern. So they
consult their guidebooks feverishly, leap into their Budget hire-cars and
roar off in search of something old or rustic or quaint. Something tucked
away. Preferably hard to get to. Understandably forgotten. This they call
'reality.'
Occasionally, of course, they do find something interesting. But often -
have you noticed? - the sum of their intrepidity is a visit to a temple, or
a ruin, or a wood-carving factory. Or a farm that ploughs with horses. Or a
little-known museum. Or a dull person's home - 'real' home, 'real' people,
sitting at a 'real' kitchen table.
On a recent flying visit to Indonesia I was in no danger of discovering the
'real' Bali - if it exists. My flight lasted 24 hours. I was severely
jet-smacked. Could barely sleep or eat. By the time I had gathered my wits,
my visit was over. But I enjoyed my stay at Bali's Grand Hyatt resort, one
of a number of ultra-comfortable, expensively well-equipped and well-planned
resort-hotels that Bali now boasts at the top end of its tourist market.
And it set me thinking. To the harum-scarum brigade, these resort-hotels
have little to do with Bali. They are not 'Balinese.' They are debased and
impure. They are interlopers, cuckoos in the Balinese nest. They are bland
and unreal - indistinguishable, in fact, from all the other up-market
resort-hotels in hot and exotic places everywhere. At best, they offer a
bastardized version of the 'real' Bali as it exists beyond the compound
gates.
But this strikes me as outright snobbery. These resorts are real. They were
built in deadly earnest. They are part of one of the most important forces
in Bali's history - 20th century tourism. And the version of Bali they offer
their well-heeled customers is not just agreeable and soothing, but
interesting in its own right. Or so I would maintain.
According to a booklet I picked up: 'Over the centuries, Chinese theatre,
Indian pageantry, Dutch pomp and Javanese court intrigue have worked their
way into the indigenous fibre of the island: the resulting culture is a
celebration of life through art and spectacle, ceremony and
dance-offerings.'
Which is all very well, but is only part of the truth, for the modern-day
culture of Bali is predominantly a celebration of - and a hustle for - the
tourist dollar. As the booklet admits: 'The concept of Art with a capital
'A' was introduced by Europeans . . . By now, every home on Earth must have
at least one Balinese wood carving.'
Alongside the tourist Bali, there is agriculture. So if the harum-scarum
brigade wanted to write about an alternative Bali that was genuinely
distinguishable from its tourism, they would have to interview farmers and
write about - wet-rice cultivation. Which could be rather boring.
Naturally, a resort like the Bali Grand Hyatt is a place for achievers. You
don't just stumble there by accident. Double rooms cost from Dollars 170
(Pounds 120) to Dollars 250 per night. One-bedroom suites cost from Dollars
450 to Dollars 1,200 per night. And two-bedroom suites cost up to Dollars
1,450 per night. There are also two villas, at Dollars 1,750 (two bedrooms)
and Dollars 2,000 (three bedrooms) per night. Food is expensive: American
breakfast costs Dollars 12.75, and the table d'hote lunch and the table
d'hote dinner cost Dollars 48.50 per day. On top of all this you will be hit
by a 10 per cent service charge and a government tax of 7.5 per cent.
What do you get in return? Well, everything you would expect: six swimming
pools, a third of a mile of excellent beachfront, a great many water-sports,
40 acres of landscaped gardens and lagoons, pretty waterfalls, tasteful
guestrooms, good food, a fitness and health centre, whirlpools, massage
centre, hair and beauty salon, predictably expensive shops, squash courts
and floodlit tennis courts, jogging trail, putting and chipping green, a
special club for children, a self-contained convention centre, and plenty of
treks and tours beyond the compound gates.
The Bali Grand Hyatt is large - 750 rooms, organised in a cluster of four
'ethnic' villages - but you never feel crowded, mainly because of the skill
of the landscaping and the excellence of the design. The concept is said to
be that of a Balinese water-palace reminiscent of the legendary palace of
Tirta Gangga, in Karangasem. Works of art - paintings, sculpture, masks,
furniture, pottery, textiles, even a transplanted Hindu temple from the
village of Bualu - are dotted all about.
I especially liked this quote from the resort's management: 'The many ponds
and lagoons surrounding the hotel are kept crystal clear by a biological
filtering system using fish. The right number and mixture of fish ensure
that they not only decorate the lagoons but in turn eat up the algae formed
during the natural photosynthesis process.' All cutting-edge stuff.
The harum-scarum brigade will probably argue that I am wrong: that there is
a 'real' Bali beyond the resort gates that is worth looking into - 'real'
people living 'real' lives in ways unchanged since before the end of the
last Ice Age, when, says my booklet: 'Bali was 'Land's End' for the Chinese
mainland, a sort of prehistoric California for the 'beautiful people' of the
earliest migrations from the North.'
Don't you believe it. Today, all the 'real' Balinese are lifeguards,
cocktail waitresses, gardeners, tennis coaches, taxi-drivers, wood-carvers,
hairdressers, room maids, rave-dancers, tattooed beach-boys, PR hustlers and
other service-providers. The 'real' Bali is what you find in the landscaped
grounds of resorts like the Grand Hyatt. The stuff outside the gates is just
local colour.
Michael Thompson-Noel was a guest of the Grand Hyatt, Bali, PO Box 53, Nusa
Dua, Bali, Indonesia, tel: (62)-(361)-71188, fax: (62)-(361)-72038. Nusa Dua
is 20 minutes from Denpasar airport. In addition to the room rates quoted
above, there is a high-season supplement this year of Dollars 20 per room
per night during August and on December 20-31.
Internationally, there are 164 Hyatt hotels and resorts, with more under
construction.
Getting to Bali can be tedious or even health-threatening: try and avoid
Garuda, the Indonesia state airline, which operates tiresome magical mystery
tours, stopping everywhere you have ever heard of. Check that your airline,
travel agent or tour company is selling you the swiftest possible flights.
You may have to shout.

A HISTORY OF WALES
by John Davies
Allen Lane Pounds 30, 718 pages
IT IS A conspicuous phenomenon. The histories of Ireland, Scotland, Ulster
and Wales have all now been vigorously established. But writing the history
of England is no longer a la mode. No better index of this is the news that
the Pelican History of England, staunch vade-mecum of the sixth-form swot,
is to be replaced by a Pelican History of Britain and, what is more, that it
is to be written largely by transatlantic authorities.
To anyone who has ever been in the 'Celtic fringe' long enough to know that
it is not a fringe but its own domain of self-defined activity, this comes
as no surprise. The English have got their come-uppance. For years, the
English have bullishly regarded British history as English history. Never
mind 1066 and All That: what do the English know of 1536, 1707 and 1800?
These are dates which still rankle with the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish,
for they mark the extension of English sovereignty throughout the British
Isles; but up until recently, very little English historical attention has
been focused on those Acts of Union, and the residual fragility of that
nationhood which we call 'British'. The Maastricht debate has been useful in
this respect: it has shown just how few of our parliamentarians (especially
the 'patriotic' among them) have any understanding of how weak and cosmetic
are the bonds which hold 'Britain' together.
Against this background, John Davies' History of Wales makes a timely
appearance. The value of the book is attested by its own history.
Commissioned by Penguin to come out in Welsh, it materialised so large that
a paperback was impossible, but Allen Lane issued Hanes Cymru in 1990 never
the less.
The Welsh original had an almost totemic force, whatever its contents: I
well remember with what pride it was displayed in the dingy windows of sub
Post Offices in minor mid-Welsh market towns. And now Davies has turned his
Welsh text into English, bringing it to the wider readership it much
deserves.
There is always a danger that these nationalistic histories will be quaint.
And indeed, some aspects of Welsh nationalism are quaint: anti-English
sentiment is always framed in Welsh as anti-Saxon, and assumes a purity of
English culture that really no longer exists (in many 'English' towns
Punjabi must be almost as much used as English). It may be that English
nationalistic history is no longer possible precisely because England is now
much more of a multi-cultural society than Wales, Scotland or Ireland.
Although Davies is palpably passionate about Wales as a nation, and a nation
with a future as well as a past, he manages to keep his narrative free of
whimsy. His agenda is straightforward: he has to show how 'Wales' and 'the
Welsh' have survived as significant terms despite the fact that since 1536
(if not earlier, effectively) the country and its people have been treated
as a part - or worse, an appendage - of England.
The survival is remarkable. So many factors could be hypothetically invoked
as reasons for the eclipse of Wales. The lack of its own political
institutions; the lack (still felt) of a decent infrastructure; the lack,
until 1955, of a capital city; the difficult terrain; and so on. Yet the
eclipse never happened. The defiance of Wales is not overtly explained here,
but we can see for ourselves how it was nourished.
Davies engages with all types of history - economic, social, religious, even
archaeology - but wherever he is he has an eye for the prime medium of
communication. From the bards who delighted the warlords of the 14th century
to the prodigious pamphleteering of evangelist dissenters in the eighteenth,
and Radio Cymru in the 20th, the Welsh have communicated to each other in
their own language.
And it is no exaggeration to say that the language has preserved the
nationality of Wales. There may never have been a Wordsworth of the Valleys,
but lyrical ballads circulate in Wales as they no longer do elsewhere.( To
see a child of six stand before an audience of thousands, take a single note
from a harp, and then deliver a song in perfect pitch, is extraordinary to
outsiders attending an eisteddfod, but natural to this country). It is clear
that the centre of gravity for Wales resides, as it always has done, in the
language: and it was Matthew Arnold's big mistake, when he was Inspector of
Schools, to suppose that you could keep 'Welsh culture' without its own
linguistic base.
A cultural centre of gravity does not, of course, imply absolute cohesion.
There are two distinct facets to Welsh history: one is the Celtic, the other
(to borrow an Arnoldism) the Hebraic - by which I mean the tea-urn culture
of Dissent and Nonconformity. Bingeing versus temperance, poets versus
preachers, warriors versus pacificists: following the interaction of the
Celtic and Hebraic throughout this book is perhaps the most satisfying part
of it. But whether it is for hell-fire or lechery, the language has been one
and the same: which is why it is entirely right, and an act of enlightenment
from Penguin that A History of Wales comes after, not before, Hanes Cymru.

IMPERIAL WARRIOR: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT ALLENBY
1861-1936
by Lawrence James
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 279 pages
VISCOUNT ALLENBY, the victor of Megiddo and pacifier of Egypt, is a hard
target for the biographer to get in range. Nicknamed 'the Bull', he
successively projected different personae. He was by turns a 'pattern'
general, product of the Arnoldian public school system and Sandhurst, and
the closest thing to George Patton among Britain's First World War generals.
Sometimes he commanded by numbers, sometimes he exhibited sustained bursts
of military genius.
He only joined the army because he failed the Indian Civil Service entrance.
He also failed the Staff College exam on the first sitting. Nevertheless TE
Lawrence, who knew him as well as any man, could write: 'Allenby was so
great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him.' If Allenby
was great, then he was a late developer.
The key to the character may well be the same as the key to the life:
Allenby took a while to find his own range, but once he had done so, he was
magnificent. His appetite for traditional soldiering - sweeping movements of
well-disciplined, well-equipped and well-provisioned armies in the service
of a cause - was singularly at odds with conditions on the Western Front,
but came into its own in Palestine, on the periphery of the war.
Yet the huge, polyglot triumph of Megiddo (under his command he had ANZAC,
Indian, French, Armenian and Nigerian as well as British battalions) was not
his finest hour: that came four years later, in 1922, when as High
Commissioner in Egypt he took on Lloyd-George and the Cabinet. The
government wanted the Wafd nationalist revolt crushed and British rule
re-imposed, if necessary by maximum force. Allenby saw that a reasonable
accommodation of Egypt's nationalist aspirations was the only course likely
to secure control of the Suez Canal. In a Downing Street showdown he got his
way.
Allenby had proved himself not only a capable administrator but an astute
politician to boot. He had spotted the great contradiction in British Middle
East policy. On the one hand, if only to keep the French out, London had
been prepared to grant Syrian Arabs independence; on the other, it sought to
keep Egypt and the Sudan within the colonial fold. Britain could not have it
both ways. The alternative would have been to argue in favour of France's
share of the post-Ottoman prize.
Whereas previous biographies have tended to gloss over Allenby's final
incarnation, Lawrence James gives it detailed attention, even at the cost of
an authorial contradiction. Imperial Warrior concedes that its subject,
sorting out the Egyptians, 'was a pragmatist first and an Imperialist
second'. 'Pragmatic Warrior' might have been the more accurate, if less
sellable, title.
Through the discontinuities of Allenby's career a unifying strand can be
found: a canny regard for his own advancement guided by a sober attachment
to duty. Allenby must have loathed serving under Haig in Flanders, but he
had too much nous to bad-mouth his superior. The spectacular spleen was
always reserved for subordinates; and it is indicative that the Field
Marshal did not write, let alone publish, his memoirs. This sets the
biographer at a disadvantage. Apart from some letters to his much-loved
wife, there is little or no window on the inner man.
But Lawrence James pulls a splendid rabbit from an unpromising hat. The
strength of Imperial Warrior is its author's grasp of the history. Quite
properly, the life is the campaigns fought. James makes fine sense of the
Boer War (which created the disciplinarian and tempered the cavalry
officer), the deadlock of the Western Front, the eastern Mediterranean and
Egypt itself.
Amid the flow of dispassionate judgments, there is room also for anecdote.
We are reminded how, at the turn of the century, one Major-General Brabazon
seriously suggested that the cavalry should be re-equipped with battle-axes,
since these were 'ideally suited to the Anglo-Saxon temperament'. Of Allenby
in Palestine we learn that he frequently drove to the front-line in a
Rolls-Royce, while the RFC dropped cartons of cigarettes laced with opium on
already demoralised Turkish troops. Best of all is an account of Allenby's
intelligence officer in August 1914: keen to discover the pace of the German
advance, Colonel George Barrow telephoned every station in Belgium from
Mons. 'A reply in French or Flemish indicated they were still in Belgian
hands. Silence or a German voice meant that they had been taken.'

COLLECTED POEMS 1945-1990
by R S Thomas
Dent Pounds 25, 548 pages
CYMRU OR WALES?
by R S Thomas
Gomer Pounds 3.75, 32 pages
HENRY VAUGHAN, David Jones, Vernon Watkins, Dylan Thomas, R S Thomas - there
is a continuing tradition of Welsh poets who write in English, and English
poetry would be much impoverished without them. Sometimes their work has its
origin in native Welsh experience, like Watkins's Ballad of the Mari Lwyd;
at others it stems from the poet's sense of being a part of a European
tradition with roots in classical Greece and Rome, as may be seen in the
many fine translations that Watkins made into English verse from Homer,
Dante, Ronsard, Baudelaire, Goethe, Rilke.
There is a similar double-vision in the work of R S Thomas, who celebrated
his 80th birthday on March 29 with a massive volume containing his poetic
output over the best part of half a century. In many of the poems Thomas
appears as the poet of rural Wales, portraying individually named
farm-workers, their wives and children, the inhabitants of his parish, seen
against a sharply etched background. One figure constantly recurs - Iago
Prytherch, the labourer, a Welsh Piers Plowman, whose harsh life Thomas
never tires of describing.
Yet there are also many poems in the R S Thomas canon that transport the
reader far from Welsh concerns. Kierkegaard and Wallace Stevens are two
non-Welshmen who ignite Thomas's muse; so do many French painters. One of
his recent books, Ingrowing Thoughts (1985) was entirely devoted to poems
based on modern art, starting with Picasso and Matisse, concluding with
Magritte, Max Ernst and Roland Penrose. Whether he is writing about a Welsh
milkmaid or Matisse's 'Portrait of a Girl in a Yellow Dress', Thomas's
approach remains the same. He stands back from the object of his
contemplation, recreating its appearance in carefully structured words, and
letting it serve, by the close, as a general reflection on the human
condition. The language is austere, the rhymes sparse, the mood often
bitter.
For much of his life Thomas wrote his poetry while serving as a minister of
the Church, in 1936 at Chirk on the Welsh border, and then among the hill
farmers of Montgomeryshire; but the reader who expects a God-centred
lyricism, hymning the Welsh countryside, will be disappointed. It was that
other Thomas - Dylan - who composed odes in praise of innocence and sunshine
at harvest-time, who sang of 'the round Zion of the waterbead and the
synagogue of the ear of corn', not this one. By contrast Rev Thomas watches
his parishioner Evans, 'On his way to the fields, where he hoes/ up one roe
of mangolds and down/ The next one' and just in case we should be so foolish
as to think that the poet is glorifying Evans as some kind of latter-day
Wordsworthian solitary, he adds: 'You needn't wonder/ What goes on in his
mind, there is nothing/ Going on there . . . '
To find Thomas's sense of a connection between his two careers, the Church
and literature, one needs to consult the introduction he made in 1967 to his
selection from the poetry of George Herbert. He speaks there of: 'The
possibility of a fruitful relationship between Christianity and poetry. The
bridge between the two latter is the Incarnation. If poetry is concerned
with the concrete and the particular, then Christianity aims at their
redemption and consecration. The poet invents the metaphor, and the
Christian lives it'.
These complementary approaches to human suffering act together in his own
work and underlie a dialogue that runs right through it. Thomas finds it
difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile himself to the miserable and
often futile lives of the ordinary men and women in his pastoral care. 'The
great problems,' he writes in one characteristically short laconic poem,
'Remain, stubborn, unsolved'.
One of the saddest tasks a priest has to perform is to be present at the
deathbed of one of his flock whom he has known and loved. Father Gerard
Manley Hopkins watched the farrier Felix Randall 'pining, pining' until,
wasted with disease, he died. But then, miraculously, that poem did end on a
redemptive note, as Hopkins remembered Felix as he was formerly, full of
health and strength, and making for 'the great grey drayhorse his bright and
battering sandal]'
In Thomas's poem 'The Mill' he describes how he would pay regular visits to
a miller confined to his bed for nine years before he died. The poem ends
with no spark of redemption: 'The great frame rotted/ While the past's slow
stream,/ Flowing through his head,/ Kept the rusty mill/ Of the mind turning
 / It was I it ground'.
Thomas deals with the condition of Wales in several of his poems in the same
spirit of ruthless candour. He is a passionately committed nationalist
appalled by much that he sees going on around him. He was 30 before he
learnt to speak Welsh but he wishes that he and the other Welsh poets I
mention had written in their own indigenous language.
He deeply resents, as he says in his outspoken pamphlet Cymru or Wales?,
'the effects of an English life-style, English thought processes and the
English vocabulary . . . ' However, as I hope I have indicated, this
resentment has not prevented Thomas in his poetry from attaining to a great
mastery over the English language.

HEISENBERG'S WAR: THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE GERMAN BOMB
by Thorns Powers
Jonathan Cape Pounds 20, 608 pages
SOME MEN flaunt their wars. Werner Heisenberg, leading physicist of Hitler's
Third Reich, did not. Heisenberg, lauded in 1933 with the Nobel Prize for
his Uncertainty Principle, has a war record about which very little seems
certain. Thorns Powers, in telling The Secret History of the German Bomb,
struggles to pin down just what Heisenberg was up to. In particular, how
consciously did he operate a one-man go-slow, and if so, why?
Powers' 500-page narrative necessarily concentrates as much on the atom bomb
that was made - the Allied bomb - as on the one that was not. The central
fascination of the tale lies in the bluff-counter-bluff resorted to by both
sides as each sought to probe the other's motives and progress. Can any
sliver of information be taken at face value?
Early on a report reaches the West that Heisenberg 'tries to delay the work
as much as possible.' True, or bluff? The Americans were unconvinced, but
their own counter-probes could not be pressed with too great an intensity,
lest the Germans twig that the American effort was off and running.
In fact, as Powers confirms, the Germans, prompted by Heisenberg, concluded
in mid-1942 that attempting to build a bomb within the likely time-frame of
the war would be at best difficult, at worst crippling. Nor were they sure
that they could get the 'critical mass' down to manageable size. They opted
instead for a modest programme of reactor development.
The Americans and their allies continued to think that the Germans retained
an option, as it were up their sleeve, until captured documents proved the
contrary in the winter of 1944-45. Meanwhile, plans to capture or
assassinate Heisenberg were kept warm. If there were a German bomb, then
Heisenberg's work would be the underpinning of it.
By the time of the Hiroshima atom bomb explosion, Heisenberg and nine key
colleagues were safely captured and tucked away at Farm Hall, Cambridge,
chattering into hidden microphones. Powers believes that recently released
sections of the Farm Hall tapes confirm Heisenberg to have been an active
procrastinator. Heisenberg shares in the initial shock of Hiroshima, but
within a matter of days is lecturing his colleagues accurately on the
physics that lay behind the Allied success, and how the 'critical mass' had
been scaled down from the one ton the Germans initially thought necessary to
the few kilograms that made the Allied bomb deliverable. Surely, Powers
claims, the brilliant Heisenberg must have known all along, but stayed
quiet.
Yet in the post-war scramble by physicists on both sides for moral high
ground, Heisenberg never claimed the credit Powers thinks due to him. In his
most settled explanation, in a 1964 letter to Hans Bethe, Heisenberg strikes
a deftly equivocal note: 'The German physicists did not want to build atomic
bombs and were glad that they were spared the decision about producing
atomic bombs by external circumstances. In this, what you called 'social
conscience' played a considerable role, although there were other motives,
not least the pure self-preservation instinct.'
Here, surely, lies the essential difference in the psychological drives of
each side. Physicists working to the Allied tune could assume that failure
would not bring direct retribution. German physicists would hesitate before
promising Hitler a bomb and then being unable to deliver. A 'pure
self-preservation instinct' would lead you into not taking the risk.
The quieter life was the best guarantor of the longer one.

THE VOICE OF THE EARTH
by Theodore Roszak
Bantam Press Pounds 17.99, 368 pages
IMAGINE, says Theodor Roszak, a motion picture of planet Earth filmed from
space over the last million years. In the closing minutes, after long
periods of slow change, we see the emergence of human beings and the marks
they have made on the planet: canals, cities, roads.
In the closing seconds a startling phenomenon occurs. In the Midlands of
England black dots appear, 'like strange, smouldering sores' breaking out on
the planet's surface. They belch smoke as they spread across the face of
Europe and then North America. 'Focusing in more closely,' says Roszak, 'we
can see heaps of slag and rubble forming around them like weltering flesh .
. . Rivulets of oily waste and noxious fluids issue from these fuming sites,
draining into nearby lakes and streams.'
This graphic tale is the history of industrialisation as viewed from the
heavens. It dramatises the approaching crisis; a pox of pollutants is eating
the planet away, spewing out more garbage than the planet can handle. The
process, Roszak grimly warns, 'may be nearing its terminal stage'. What has
brought us to this pass is a kind of madness - 'ecomadness', so to say -
which has resulted from a psychological divorce between people and the
planet.
Viewed rightly, people and planet form a continuum; planetary and personal
needs and well-being are inextricably linked. The link, Roszak argues, is
deep. Human beings have an 'ecological unconscious' and in order to save
both mankind and Earth a new form of psychological therapy is needed, to
heal the rift between people and planet which is leading to today's
destructive insanity. This healing is to be effected by rewaking our
inherent sense of the mutual dependence between us and our natural
environment, thus prompting our sense of ethical responsibility for it.
The new form of therapy is 'ecopsychology', and Roszak's book culminates in
a description of its principles. Its aim is to recover mankind's oneness
with nature. The materials for this remarriage are to be found, Roszak tells
us, in ecology, 'ecofeminism', animism, the Gaia hypothesis, the Anthropic
Principle, and more.
On the back cover US vice president Al Gore waxes enthusiastic over this New
Ageism, describing it as 'powerful, compelling, extraordinary'. It is
extraordinary, all right; for its sheer catholicity. The only thing missing
is the kitchen sink. The message of this book is a simple and unimpeachable
one which we have heard many times but which we need to hear constantly. It
is that we will destroy the human race, and other species besides, if we do
not stop polluting the planet.
But Roszak enfolds this manifesto in 600 pages of lost opportunity. There is
much new thinking at present about the natural environment and mankind's
relationship to it. Some of it is valuable, some of it nonsense. Roszak does
not discriminate between the two. He invokes anything that will achieve a
rhetorical effect, which means that he undermines his argument by making it
depend on too many doubtful and suppositious notions, for example
'mystical-religious-feminist environmentalism', which are more likely to
disaffect than persuade readers.
The main fault in Roszak's argument is his claim that mankind is killing the
planet. This is untrue. Ecological anxiety over the environment is, in
truth, a more parochial matter: it is anxiety over our threat to ourselves
and some of the world's current flora and fauna. Yes, there is a serious
danger to humankind, but the planet itself will survive, and within
thousands or millions of years it will regenerate itself, just as it did in
the past after collisions with meteors, climate changes, ice ages, and other
catastrophes.
What Roszak should have explained is why we ought to guard against their own
extinction; why a distinctively human presence, with human values, should
survive on the planet. But this thought seems not to have occurred to him.

FT  10 APR 93 / Gardening: For eyes and teas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER one day's Easter gardening, perhaps you would already like a change:
after two, the back muscles may enforce one. If so, go and see what others
have made of their time. This year, there are more than 2,800 gardens open
on Sundays and weekdays in England and Wales. To find them, you need a car,
curiosity - and the familiar Yellow Book. This year's edition costs Pounds 2
over the counter, Pounds 3 by UK post or Pounds 3.75 air mail to Europe.
Cheques should be made out to the National Gardens Scheme and sent to its
new address of Hatchlands Park, East Clandon, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7RT.
The many great gardens in Scotland and Ulster do not appear between the same
yellow covers because they run on slightly different seasons to those in the
main book. But they are an essential extra. Scotland's Gardens Scheme will
post you its handbook for Pounds 2.50 from 31 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH1
2EL; Ulster gardens can be found in a list from the Public Affairs Manager,
National Trust, Rowallane, Saintfield, Co. Down. For breaks in May or late
July, these booklets from the Celtic fringe are invaluable.
This year's range of gardens is nothing if not varied. At Star Cottage,
beginning today, meetings are promised with 'mechanical artist and author
Lys de Bray, lately of Turnpike Cottage, Wimborne.' She will be greeting
visitors personally and showing them a garden which 'will become another
living library of her botanical drawings and paintings.'
Alternatively, you can check out the taste of the previous and present
archbishops of Canterbury. Today, from 2-5.30, Lambeth Palace will be
showing off the 'significant renewal' of the past five years. The roots were
laid by the Runcies (previous), and it is good to think that there is
renewal somewhere in the Anglican garden-at-large which can be called
significant.
In any case, who knows what you might meet in an archbishop's garden on the
eve of Easter? Remember, too, that the proceeds from tea go to the Lambeth
boy scouts.
Further north, near Ironbridge, Shropshire, the owners will show you their
prize-winning garden, 'formerly the site of a rubbish tip developed by
owners as a nature garden to attract wildlife.' Teas here assist the
Arthritis and Rheumatism Council for Research: fellow-gardeners will
sympathise.
These prize-winnings are becoming more evident in the self-descriptions in
the Yellow Book, competing with past television appearances and
easily-overlooked 'features.' Near Portsmouth, you are invited to a
prize-winner 'in 1988 and 1990 in The News water garden competition.' At the
Tarn in Oxhey Drive, 'much of the garden was 'tree-lifted' by present owner
from Hampstead in 1970' but it is not an ordinary tree-lift: in its previous
home, 'it had a mention by the late Lanning Roper in the Sunday Times.' As
rank and degree grows between our gardens, I have strange visions of a 21st
century where Sundays will be spent seeing tree-lifts from 'gardens once
mentioned by the late Arthur Hellyer.'
At 2 The Cottage, near Mayford in Surrey, you are asked to park 'tactfully'
beside a garden included in the Good Housekeeping feature on cottage
gardens. Even more to the point, home-made teas are available all day.
Indeed, teas are stratified as carefully as the prize-winning gardens. Teas
should never be confused with home-made teas or teas in aid of the village
church, let alone with teas at shop. At the John Hine Studios in Aldershot,
Hampshire, you can even have teas in a 'traditional English tea room.'
As for open villages with groups of gardens, personally, I give them a wide
berth. I used to live in one and, on Sundays, unwary suckers were asked to
fork out to visit several rather ordinary gardens with a cherry or two
between them, lots of London Pride by the slippery paving stones, and pots
of chives for sale at the door. As a gardener, I limit my visiting to those
places which are given the Yellow Book's star symbol for floral or botanical
interest. I avoid those laid out within the past seven years or which
emphasise the approximate number of their plants.
But if you want only the best, how do you find them? You can begin with the
Good Gardens Guide, edited by Graham Rose and Peter King and published by
Barrie and Jenkins. It narrows down the candidates to a mere 1,000, within
which you can usually trust the starred choices.
Regular openings usually (but not always) imply real quality. Good news
spreads on the grapevine: about Greencombe, in Somerset, perhaps; the Old
Rectories at Burghfield or Farnborough in Berkshire; or the Old Manor at
Twyning in Gloucestershire (where I envied a superb corylopsis beside a
vibrant blue corydalis flexuosa only last week).
Old favourites are rising higher under a new generation of owners, like
Kiftsgate Court or Hodges Barn in Gloucestershire. Others are tailing away;
but one feels that Wisley, the Royal Horticultural Society's pride and joy,
should not be leading them.
Curiosity never killed a gardener; usually it improves us. If they try to
sell you primula Wanda as if it were one of grandma's rarities among the
home-made cream teas, do remember that all your visiting is also a means to
an end. Not every trip can be to a little-known Sissinghurst.
By this Sunday ritual, all garden visitors are turned into cash for
charities: visit three shockers and you have helped to pay for a Macmillan
cancer nurse. Last year, the Gardens Scheme earned nearly Pounds 750,000, a
reward for all the unsung efforts of organisers and the labours of all those
gardeners who, somehow, we take for granted when they have the nerve to open
up for us.

FT  10 APR 93 / Property: When religion gives way to conversions - A look at
the market for redundant churches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSING a church or chapel is painful. In many cases, it has stood for
decades - sometimes, centuries - as a centre of community life and a place
of reflection and beauty. What a delight to walk into a well-tended church
with brass gleaming and the smell of furniture wax, incense or candles
hanging in the air.
'Hatless, I take off my cycle-clips in awkward reverence,' wrote Philip
Larkin in his poem Church Going. Larkin wondered why the place ('This
special shell') mattered to him when he did not believe in God.
How right he was. Many people do not go to church regularly - if at all -
but still see themselves in some loose way as Christians. And, in a
sentimental British fashion, they feel the local church ought to be there in
case they need it.
But congregations drop - some country churches see fewer than 10 on Sunday
mornings - and people move. New suburbs need new churches. Others, built in
Victorian times to take the gospel to the Industrial Revolution, are left
stranded in the middle of slum clearance or traffic schemes.
What can be done? The Church of England looks for alternative uses as
restaurants, art galleries, museums, concert halls, offices, workshops or
even flats. Such schemes fit best into medieval and Georgian churches where
the architecture derives from the style of the long hall and the drawing
room. But Victorian churches, with their lack of windows, are far harder to
adapt. They were built as statements of belief when doubt was already on the
increase - intellectually with Darwin and Huxley, and socially among the
toiling urban masses to whom religion was irrelevant. Every detail in them,
especially the sight lines, was planned to make the point and they resist
conversion to other uses.
Matthew Saunders, of the Ancient Monuments Society (AMS), says two good
Georgian conversions are St George's in Bolton, Lancashire, and St Julian's,
Shrewsbury, both now craft centres. The Grade I-listed St Mary's, Gateshead,
has become an auction house and arts centre while St Mary's, Bedford, is an
archaeologists' workroom and St James the Great at Bethnal Green, London,
provides 24 affordable flats for first-time buyers.
The Redundant Churches Fund (RCF) has money - 70 per cent government, 30 per
cent Church Commissioners - to preserve exceptional buildings without having
to find alternative uses. The RCF has 271 such C. of E. churches in its care
while the dioceses look after a few more. So do the Friends of Friendless
Churches, whose aims are obvious. They share offices with the AMS in, of
course, a church: Wren's St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe in the City of London.
Soon, with the inauguration of the Historic Chapels Trust (HCT),
non-conformists will have a scheme like the RCF. Chapels, often in a
sub-Georgian style, have the space and windows to convert well and have
become museums (as have synagogues in Cheetham, Manchester and Spitalfields,
London), offices, galleries, houses and flats. If they are Methodist, they
will have restrictive covenants forbidding their use to sell alcohol, or for
gambling, public dancing or Sunday trading.
The handsomest chapel now on sale is the 1835 Old Chapel in Blockley,
Gloucestershire. This Cotswolds building has a Palladian facade and has been
converted sympathetically to make an attractive, contemporary two-bedroom
house. Jackson-Stops offers it at around Pounds 285,000.
Far simpler, but carrying the gambling/sale-of-drink restrictions, is the
Old Chapel on the edge of the village of Chillaton, near Tavistock in Devon.
Better inside than out, it has a lean-to that held the Sunday school.
Millerson offers it at around Pounds 125,000.
Cheaper still is the former Mission Chapel of the Good Shepherd in Great
Langton, near Northallerton in North Yorkshire. It is 115 years old, was
used religiously until 12 years ago and has planning permission for
conversion to a two-bedroom house. The River Swale is close by for fishing.
(The neighbouring School House and Old School are sold already). The chapel
is on offer at over Pounds 30,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker.
In Warwickshire, the Methodist Chapel at Long Compton might go for less than
the guide price of Pounds 25,000 upwards when Tayler &amp; Fletcher auctions it
on April 28 at The Bull in Burford.
If you like chapels but do not want to live in one, Toat House near
Pulborough, West Sussex, is a farm with 166 acres and a chapel to St Wilfred
in the grounds. Toat is on offer from GA Town &amp; Country and Humberts at over
Pounds 650,000.
Over in East Sussex, Heathfield Park, a grand late-17th century Georgian
house (from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, around Pounds 850,000) has a
barrel-vaulted chapel in the cellar. The same firm offers a large Edwardian
house at Wadhurst, used recently by an order of nuns as St Benedict's
Priory, for around Pounds 400,000; it has 24 bedrooms and a 1960s' chapel.
For the chance to live in a converted Victorian city church, Winkworth
offers a flat in Steeple Court, Bethnal Green, London E1 (convenient for the
City). The guide price for the leasehold is Pounds 99,000, with 94 years to
go. A Pounds 100 annual ground rent and 12 flats in the building raise the
intriguing thought that this could be the first ex-church to win collective
enfranchisement (acquire the freehold) when the Housing and Urban
Development Bill becomes law.

FT  10 APR 93 / Motoring: When all the choices are good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE conversation goes something like this.
Him: 'What have you been driving recently?'
Me: 'The new Rover 600, several Mitsubishi Galants and some Peugeot 306s.'
Him: 'What were they like?'
Me: 'Very good cars indeed. Quiet, quick, refined and enjoyable to drive.'
Him: 'But that's what you said about the Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Corsa and
Citroen Xantia you drove a few weeks earlier.'
Me: 'That's right. They were all very good cars, too.'
The time has come to face the truth. The really bad new car no longer
exists. On second thoughts, let me qualify that. The really bad west
European or Far Eastern car no longer exists. For all I know, some really
dreadful machines may still be made in the depths of what used to be the
Soviet Union, or the Indian sub-continent, or the vast republic of China. I
do not know because I have not tried them. But it is a racing certainty that
any new car you buy will offer safe, reliable and comfortable transport.
If these three qualities are your only criteria, you have absolutely no need
to spend more than, say, Pounds 18,000 on a motor car. Half that will still
buy you more than adequate standards of safety, reliability and comfort.
You can have power steering on a Pounds 9,000 car; even automatic
transmission, too, if you settle for a Malaysian Proton. And Pounds 18,000,
at the most, will buy a car that has everything needed to make a demanding
motorist content. Only if you feel compelled to drive a large and / or
prestigious car do you need to spend more.
Of course, objectivity is the last thing to govern many car purchases or
choices of company car. Look at all those high-slung, knobbly-tyred 4 x 4s
that spend their lives on urban and suburban tarmac. And the turbo-charged
sports coupes driven sedately from home to shops and the golf club.
At the moment, though, I will deal with new cars at below this level because
I have driven quite a few of them recently. I have praised Ford's Mondeo,
the Citroen Xantia and Vauxhall's (Opel) Corsa already. They are not
flawless. The Mondeo lacks rear seat space and you feel road bumps more as
you go up-range and the tyres get fatter. To my taste, the two-litre was
under-geared.
The least-powerful version of the elegant and beautifully-suspended Xantia
also was geared low enough to be a bit buzzy at 80 mph (128 kmh) on an
autoroute. And the fastest Corsa, the 16-valve 1.6i, was a great drive on
smooth roads but I felt every single cobblestone on Spanish pavements. None
of these flaws is serious, and none affects the general excellence of the
cars concerned.
Much the same can be said of three other new models I sampled last month:
the Rover 600, Mitsubishi Galant and Peugeot 306. There are nine Rover 600s,
ranging from a two-litre 620i at Pounds 13,995 to a 2.3-litre 623GSi at
Pounds 21,995. It is no secret that, mechanically, they differ hardly at all
from the new Honda Accord built at Swindon, Wiltshire. This has been
exported for several months and goes on sale in Britain soon after the
Rovers reach the showrooms on April 20.
Rover has made many cosmetic changes to the front and back ends. The
interior is in the tradition of a 1960s' Rover when the marque was the
natural choice of country solicitors and bank managers. The name, one feels,
is still among Rover's greatest assets.
My favourite was the 623 GSi automatic. At 90 mph (145 kmh), and 4,000 rpm,
the Honda engine - also made in Britain - could barely be heard over the
soft rush of wind, The transmission was ultra-smooth; it even kicked down
without a jerk into low at 35 mph (56 kmh).
Build quality of all the 600s I tried was first class. The seats are
body-hugging and neither too firm nor too yielding. Although the suspension
allows quite a lot of vertical wheel movement to take the sting out of rough
roads, the ride is well damped and the Rovers hardly roll on corners.
Rover is pitching the 600s against the BMW 3-Series. Clearly, the Honda
Accord will be a rival if company fleet managers can be convinced a Honda
really is British. So will the poshest two-litre Mondeo Ghias and the latest
Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra on mainland Europe).
There are 21 variants of the Mitsubishi Galant, which is priced from Pounds
12,750 to Pounds 20,299 and looks unnervingly like the Renault Safrane. The
entry model is an 1800 saloon. The flagship is a five-door hatchback
(Mitsubishi calls it a coupe) with a 2.5-litre, multi-valve V6, four-wheel
drive, four-wheel steering and a finger-light, five-speed gearbox.
The 2.5-litre 4WD, 4WS performed brilliantly on near-deserted roads in the
region around Arcachon in France, showing unbreakable grip when accelerating
and cornering. Again my favourite was a front-wheel driven V6, two-litre
automatic with a degree of passive rear-wheel steer.
The transmission, available on all Galants except the 4WD, 4WS coupe, has
electronic control with 'fuzzy logic.' Don't ask me how it works. What it
does is sense a driver's mood and contrive to be in the right ratio all the
time.
Last, but not least, the Peugeot 306, Coventry-built alongside the larger
Peugeot 405. Although it uses the same mechanicals as the Citroen ZX, it
feels different. For ride quality and general refinement, the 306 is even
better than the ZX, probably because it is a little heavier and reflects
another two years of development.
Peugeot sees as its closest rival the Vauxhall (Opel) Astra, although the
306 lacks the Astra's optional driver-side airbag. It is a little bigger
overall, and considerably roomier than, the 205 and replaces the 309, which
was a stretched version of the 205.

FT  10 APR 93 / Sport: Courage on the high seas - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY

<TEXT>
CAROL Randall remembers the time and the place precisely. It was 7.55 on the
evening of March 5 when the Southern Ocean shattered her right knee. The
yacht Heath Insured was half way between Hobart and Cape Town (the nearest
land being Antarctica) and Carol was helming the 38-tonne boat through the
worst storm the British Steel round the world race had yet encountered.
A wave as tall as a three-storey house slewed the yacht around. The wheel
span uncontrollably, taking Carol's 9st weight down on to the leg she was
bracing herself against. The twisting motion tore two ligaments apart.
'It was absolute, instant agony. I felt like my knee had exploded. The good
point was that I hadn't heard anything crack,' recalled Carol, 33, as she
hobbled across the Cape Town waterfront on crutches. It was the kind of
sports injury found on pitches across the world every weekend. Serious but
routine.
However, there was no stretcher and hospital bed for Carol. Fellow crew
members carried her below for an initial examination. Since the temperature
on deck was only just above freezing, with about another minus ten degrees
of wind chill, the patient was wearing three layers of foul-weather gear
plus thermal long johns.
Carol's knee was strapped and she was given strong pain-killers before being
lifted into her bunk. Every time Heath Insured slid down the face of
gigantic wave, gravity tried to 'torpedo' the patient down the bunk and
crunch the injured leg. the only answer was to tie Carol into the bunk.
Meanwhile, the weather was deteriorating. The wind had reached Storm Force
11, equal to the 80mph speeds that changed the British landscape in the 1987
hurricane.
'Lying in that bunk was the most frightened I've ever been,' said Carol. Her
job before leaving Britain on the Challenge was editing the Harborough Mail,
a weekly newspaper in Leicestershire. Until four years ago she had never
been on any sort of yacht.
'Down below all you hear is the shrieking wind and the blocks crashing down
on the decks. I felt a real failure, desperately isolated and very sad.'
Conditions were about as miserable as they could be for someone unable to
move without help.
When Carol needed to visit the heads (shipspeak for toilet) a colleague had
to carry her piggyback down the the central companionway over mounds of wet
sails, as the yacht pitched around like the scariest ride at a Florida theme
park.
Stuart Smith-Warren, who works at a south Wales steel plant in 'real' life,
sails in the Bristol Channel for a hobby and is mate aboard Heath Insured.
'The conditions in that storm were unbelievable,' says Smith-Warren. 'The
only time you could see anything was on the crest of a wave and then it was
just mountain peaks, capped with white, in every direction.
'When we wentdown into a trough and climbed the next wave face we sometimes
had green water as high as the first spreaders, 25ft up the mast.' A man who
has poured molten steel for a living over the past 30 years is not disposed
to exaggeration.
It sounds like a test of survival but the British Steel challenge is first
and foremost a race. On the day of Carol's accident Heath Insured had 2,274
miles remaining to Cape Town (the end of the third leg) and seven competing
yachts within 65 miles of her.
'Once you can't help push the boat, gain those extra miles, you begin to
feel excluded and useless,' added Carol, who says she signed up for the
Challenge to confront her own fears and learn how to cope with them.
'I always went into this thing for the sheer hell of the adventure. It could
have been Everest or diving. Sailing wasn't an essential part of it for me.
I suppose it's a bit like National Service used to be,' she said.
Chay Blyth, the racing yachtsman who devised and runs the British Steel
challenge, is of course an ex-paratrooper. However, the extraordinary thing
is that he has been overwhelmed with 'squaddies' eager to pay Pounds 15,000
for a season of physical hardship and adrenalin.
'In the middle of all that Southern Ocean stuff, I knew why I had paid my
Pounds 15,000 to Chay to come on this race, said Arthur Haynes,' a Heath
crew-member formerly in the computer business. 'It was so rough, it was so
cold, we were so far from every other human being. It was a turning point
for me.'
Cape Town will prove a turning point for many of the 130 crew volunteers. An
impossible dream that began three years ago will end in about eight weeks as
they sail up Southampton Water with the hooters and fire hydrants blasting.
Many have families and jobs to go back to - however reluctantly. Others are
more tied to the yachts and their fellow crews than anything else.
'I think the ones who will cope best are the older men with senior jobs or
their own businesses,' thought Pete Goss, skipper of Hofbrau Lager and a
former marine who had the job of training crew volunteers before they joined
their specific yachts. 'This will be an achievement, they'll file it away
and go on to the next deal.
'It won't be easy for people who have to go back to a fairly mundane job and
the Tube to work every day, to hack it.'
Aboard another yacht Nuclear Electric, it is hard to find a single
individual, contentedly planning a resumption of normal life. One is
planning to live in Nepal, another to go yacht delivering.
Mike Golding, skipper of Group 4 and a Berkshire fire officer by profession,
is possessed by the desire to win this extraordinary race - he gives the
crew Pocket Thoughts, such as 'Sleep for Victory'. Yet he will go back to
his fire station. 'Ultimately you have to earn your daily bread,' he says
phlegmatically.
Chay Blyth is matter-of-fact about the genie he has let out of the bottle.
'Most of them will go back to the office,' he said. 'They're professional
about what they do. They're not adventurers and drifters. So they'll go back
 -with a kitbag full of memories.'

Motor racing

TO NICK BRITTAN, former British saloon car racing champion-turned-motor
sport impresario, 25th anniversary re-run of the 1968 London to Sydney car
marathon seemed a good idea as he relaxed in an armchair in the balmy days
of August 1990.
Four months later, escaping Kabul on a Russian aircraft popping heat-seeker
decoys every ten seconds to fool the Mujahedin's SAM missiles, he was
starting to wonder. This, after all, was just the preliminary route survey.
Afghanistan, part of the original route, was 'off'.
Nevertheless, over Christmas that year Brittan made his decision. The
marathon, he announced to the world's media on January 16, 1991, was on. And
so, Saddam Hussein made clear just a few hours later, was the Gulf war.
Next Saturday the marathon finally starts from London's Chelsea Harbour
after long periods of uncertainty. For months, route surveying teams plotted
the marathon's course - through Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, across the Caspian
by ferry, then on, loosely following the ancient silk road, to Bokhara,
Samarkand and Tashkent. And, one by one, the areas exploded into conflict.
The rally competitors' intended hotel in Sarajevo, Brittan notes in a March
1992 diary entry, 'no longer exists'.
By the turn of this year, he recalls: 'I was having nightmares that all 15
countries on the route were in the process of declaring war on the country
next door. I would wake relieved to discover that this was only half true'.
The current geo-political realities will thus be uncomfortably to to the
fore of competitors' minds when, at 8am next Saturday, the official starter
lets slip the dogged by war.
From Chelsea Harbour the 106 crews, in period cars ranging from American
Ford Mustangs through Porsche 911s to Lotus Cortinas and Austin 1800
'Landcrabs', will make their way through Belgium, Germany, Austria,
Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, India and Australia. These are not the
15 countries originally on the route. To most crews' chagrin, they are not
even the 12 countries still on the route little more than a month ago. But
then even Brittan had not expected to have author Salman Rushdie among his
last-minute logistical problems.
Last year Brittan persuaded Iran to open its borders to a motor sport event
for the first time in 20 years, Brittan acknowledges his heart sank when the
death fatwah on Rushdie was renewed in February. Since then, relations with
the UK have plunged into the deep freeze. Brittan was detained for 24 hours
inside Iran while on a final survey of the Iran / Russia leg, and felt he
had no option but to reroute the rally yet again.
It is far removed from the original marathon of 1968, when competitors' main
concerns were with avoiding breakdowns and suicidal kangaroos rather than
diplomatic incidents. However, it is the new world order that has almost
certainly allowed the rally to take place at all. A commercial deal
unthinkable just five years ago means the entire rally is to be airlifted
past the trouble spots by two giant Russian Antonov freighters which dwarf
even US Air Force's mighty Galaxies. Two Antonovs have been converted by
their privatising owning company to twin cargo decks. Each aircraft is can
swallow 60 rally vehicles. The Antonovs will airlift the rally from Turkey
to Delhi.
After a five-day blast around the Indian subcontinent, taking in the
Himalays, competitors will be airlifted en masse from Bombay to the final,
10-day race across Australia. It is in the bleak vastnesses of the Nullarbor
Plain and other remote areas of the Outback where the rally's winners and
losers will be finally decided.
The structure of the 1993 rally is inevitably regarded with mixed feelings
by the 25 competing crews who also took part in the original event. Foremost
among them are Andrew Cowan and Colin Malkin, who as outright winners in
1968 will be first away from the Chelsea Harbour start line in the very same
Hillman Hunter they took to victory.
Is it, then, just a nostalgic event - a 'fun run' for those wishing to test
again the high-speed prowess of their youth? Brittan, as organiser, says it
is not. He has designed the rally to be hard and competitive, with the sole
concession that it will halt each night rather than bash on for days on end
as in 1968. By the time survivors reach Sydney on May 16, after 30 days and
11,500 miles of driving, they will have raced through 46 'special stages',
each timed to the second and ranging in length from 10 to 168 km.
The age, gender and motivations of the crews vary widely. Many of the 46
Australian crews are hard-charging youngsters. Cowan and Roger Clark,
another veteran in his 50s and perhaps Britain's best known rally driver,
will almost certainly remain faster than all of them. At the other extreme
is 66-year-old Pamela Morgan from Southampton. Entered in a Morgan
two-seater sports car. She describes herself as 'a tough old bird. I had too
many kids around in 1968. Now I have the freedom I'm off on this great
adventure'.
That, allowing a decade or two, is roughly the spirit in which I am tackling
this event with Neville Marriner, Daily Mail photographer and part-time
racing driver, in our Lotus Cortina. It is the spirit, too, in which we are
being backed by the Unipart group and its 4,000 employees, with each
sponsored mile clocked up adding to the coffers of the Save the Children
Fund. And it is the spirit in which so many other sponsors are taking part.
'It's a welcome departure from the rarified high-tech world of modern world
championship rallying,' says Brian Carte, chief executive of main event
sponsor Lombard North Central, the NatWest-owned finance house which backed
the UK's RAC world championship rally for 19 years. Parts trucks and
helicopters and many of the other standard apparatus of modern world
championship rallying are banned.
Even the Automobile Association is coming along. Four patrolmen, in
specially-equipped back-up vehicles, will provide the rescue service for
casualties. They are the winners of a contest in which no fewer than 3,000
AA employees took part . . .

FT  10 APR 93 / Sport: Seven strokes of a master - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A truism that a golf tournament never begins until the last nine holes
on Sunday afternoon, when the nerves begin to jangle and the palms to sweat
and the stern but obvious taskmaster called pressure begins to exert its
influence. It is even more true at Augusta National golf club, the site of
the US Masters, where the difficulties of each hole are magnified by the
weight of the history that has taken place there.
The tenth at Augusta; was that not where Ben Crenshaw sank a 60ft putt in
1984? And the 11th, 12th and 13th holes; are they known as Amen Corner
because they have ended so many contender's chances? Did Ed Sneed not once
stand on the 16th tee, his 69th hole, with a three-stroke lead and think to
himself: 'it is impossible not to win,' which he then did not.
The inward nine holes at Augusta bear names such as Camellia (tenth) White
Dogwood (11th), Firethorn (15th). They are anything but serene and pastoral.
To play them is an exercise in damage limitation and the man who wins the
green jacket tomorrow will have had his nerve examined on every one of the
35 or so strokes it will take him to cover its two miles.
Here are seven key shots on these holes that must be mastered before a man
can become a Master.
The second shot at the par four tenth. At 485 yards it is the longest par
four on the course. The hole falls by 100ft from tee to green. The tee shot
should bound down the hill and roll to the left from where a mid iron is
sufficient. If it does not, then the second shot is played from high on the
right side of the fairway from a downhill lie to a green that slopes away.
It is far more difficult. Tradition says the second shot must find the
green. Nick Faldo missed the green in the play-offs in 1989 and 1990, both
times ending in the bunker to the right of the green and still won.
The second shot at the 455-yard 11th. Ben Hogan once said: 'any time you see
me on this green in two you will know I mishit my second shot.' He felt it
was safer to hit to the right of the green, which is protected by water, and
then chip and one-putt. Larry Mize would agree. He chipped in from 50 yards
in the play-off against Greg Norman in 1987 and became champion. Faldo says
the only way is to attack the green. 'You have to forget about the water,
trust your swing and hit your shot.' This is what Ray Floyd did not do in
1990 against Faldo. He mishit an eight iron and the ball plunged into the
water. Tee shot at the 155-yard 12th. Tom Weiskopf took five attempts to
reach the shallow, tilted green and recorded a 13 on the hole Jack Nicklaus
calls 'the hardest in championship golf.' On the other hand, Fred Couples
had a stroke of luck here last year. His tee shot rolled back down the bank
and stopped on a collar of rough 1ft from the water. He got his par and two
hours later won his green jacket.
Tee shot at the 465-yard 13th. One of the most strategic holes in golf, (and
one of the shortest par fives in championship golf) requires a drive to be
shaped from right to left to get it around the corner of the doglegged hole.
Overdo the shaping and the ball will run into a creek or clatter among
trees.
Second shot at the same hole. This shot must clear Rae's Creek which crosses
the fairway and skirts the right side of the green. Curtis Strange got it
spectacularly wrong in 1985. He hit a four wood that landed in Rae's Creek
when he was leading by three strokes.
Second shot to the 15th (Fire Thorn). Likely to be anything from 175 to 230
yards in length, it must carry a pond. Gene Sarazen hit his second shot in
to the hole using a four-wood in 1935. Last year Couples needed only a
seven-iron for his second shot in the fourth round. Tee shot to the 170-yard
16th. Almost all over water to a wickedly sloping green. It is essential to
hit the putting surface, preferably hit it as close as Nicklaus did in 1986
when he nearly holed in one. In 1989 Ballesteros could have won. His tee
shot here flew at the flag but fell 1ft short of the green and rolled back
into the water.
Succeed with all these strokes and you have a chance of winning the US
Masters. But it is not over yet. One crucial stroke remains.
The tee shot at the 18th. 'You look down this narrow chute, trees on both
sides and not a sound in the air and I can tell you it's a terrifying sight'
said Sandy Lyle.
You must hit the fairway which runs uphill and curves to the right otherwise
there is little chance of reaching the green, even though at just over 400
yards (all uphill) the hole is quite short. Lyle hit his tee shot into the
first of two bunkers on the left of the fairway and then played a miraculous
seven iron to 10ft past the hole and sank the putt for a birdie to win in
1988. But every one else loses one stroke - at least. Jose Maria Olazabal
did so from the Lyle bunker in 1991 and Tom Watson, who had driven in to the
trees on the right, lost two. That year Ian Woosnam kept his ball in play
from the tee and won the title.
Play these strokes successfully and you might win the US Masters. If you
fail to do so and you have no chance. You do not have to believe me. Just
watch it all unfold on television tomorrow evening.

FT  10 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tuscany's good oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE travelled a long way since the mid-1970s when I bought my first
olive oil. In those days, it came in a rather baroque-looking bottle from
Boots the chemist and doubtless was intended more as a laxative than a
gastronomic accessory. Now, every delicatessen and supermarket stocks half a
dozen olive oils from different countries.
Tuscan oils are the ones we talk about most although they differ from those
originating in the more torrid parts of Italy and their peppery nature is
not always to everyone's taste. But that fiery finish is typical of the
region.
To some extent, olive oils are like the wines which are so often their
stablemates. They are the products both of climate and different varieties
of fruit. In the hotter parts of Italy, Spain and Greece, the oils often are
rich and buttery. The Tuscan character derives from the comparative coolness
of the climate and the need to pick the olives when slightly under-ripe to
avoid the winter rains and frosts.
The main Tuscan olive is the Frantoio, which gives the oils those aromas of
bananas, apples and avocados. The Moraiolo variety is responsible for the
pepper and the Leccino provides the 'fatness.'
Just as Tuscany's wine is governed by strict regulations laid down by
various consortia, so also is the olive oil. Some growers, however, have
gone one step further and formed their own, highly-select, consortium which
makes a sort of super oil called Laudemio.
This was born of the 1985 crisis when 90 per cent of Tuscany's olive trees
were blighted by frost as temperatures plummeted. But the olive is a hardy
plant, and many of those which seemed dead grew back from the roots. It was
a slow process, though, and the trees have only come back into production in
the past couple of years. During the late 1980s, much of what purported to
be Tuscan oil was anything but.
The Laudemio consortium was formed in 1990 with 31 estates and production
was limited to approved sites in central Tuscany. All the olives must be
cold-pressed before December 15 to ensure 'typicity' and great care is taken
to avoid bruising. This is intended to prevent high acidity, which could
lead to fermentation.
The acid level in Laudemio oils is fixed at half that of normal Tuscan extra
virgin, and they must be submitted to a tasting panel which meets on the
ground floor of a villa in the suburbs of Florence.
The tasters sit solemnly over a row of oils, looking for such qualities as
their balance of fruitiness and pepper, plus any defects such as rancidity.
The morning I visited, every one seemed to have passed with flying colours;
but, in all fairness, it must be noted that olive oil is not as easy to get
wrong as wine, and the success rate in the examination is correspondingly
high.
Six of these Laudemio oils are now imported into Britain in their smart, 500
cl bottles, a special feature of which is a screw-on spout which prevents
your guests from being over-lavish as they pour the contents into their
soup. And all six are excellent.
My only complaint would be about Laudemio's insistence on filtering the
oils. Many Tuscan estate-owners to whom I spoke said they preferred
unfiltered oil and used it exclusively at home. But the decision was taken
to avoid offending Americans who, apparently, want their olive oil bright,
and because the colloids tend to blacken if the oil is not kept in a cool
place.
It might well be that, in the US, they are put off by such things; but, in
Britain, the wonderful Nunez de Prado oil from Baena in Spain is sold
unfiltered to its numerous devotees. Twenty years on, I think we are quite

FT  10 APR 93 / Cookery: Putting the heat on Easter bunnies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARES once were associated with pagan rites of spring. Perhaps that is why
they are believed by some to be magical, slightly frightening creatures.
Rabbits, altogether tamer, have developed links with Easter although,
frankly, I see more commercial reasoning than Christian message in giving
and receiving chocolate bunnies and greetings cards depicting winsome cotton
tails bouncing through the daffodils.
I prefer my rabbits in the cooking pot - and the more readers I can persuade
to follow suit, the better pleased I shall be. Anything to cut down on the
numbers of these destructive wild pests attacking my garden and others
hereabouts.
But the recipes which follow - one hot and one cold to suit the vagaries of
UK weather - work every bit as well using farmed rabbit although cooking
times will vary depending on the life style (pampered or scavenging) and the
age of the bunny you use.
Although the finished dishes are different enough to be suitable for serving
on consecutive days (the first is a hot main course, the second a first
course for serving cold), both involve poaching. So, it makes sense to cook
all the meat simultaneously in the same pot. This saves time and fuel and
brings the bonus of particularly flavoursome stock - a key ingredient in the
second recipe.
RABBIT TWO WAYS
The common preliminaries for BOTH recipes are as follows:
Joint two small rabbits neatly. If they are past the first flush of youth,
marinate them overnight in the juice of a lemon with a good grinding of
black pepper.
Next day, bring 2 pt light rabbit or chicken stock to the boil in a large,
heavy-based pan together with a bouquet of bay, thyme, and around half a
dozen lightly-crushed parsley stalks. Add the rabbit joints and bring back
to simmering point.
Then, poach very gently - barely a bubble should wink at the brim - for 30
to 90 minutes depending on the age and status of the meat. When it is
tender, switch off the heat and set the covered pan aside.
RABBIT WITH CUMIN, APPLE &amp; CELERIAC (serves 4)
Ingredients: the hindquarters and most of the saddles of both rabbits,
cooked as described above; 1 very large celeriac root; 9-10 oz Cox, Royal
Gala or other aromatic eating apple; a generous teaspoon cumin seed; 1
teaspoon wholegrain mustard; 1 1/2 oz butter.
Method: Prepare and poach the rabbit joints as described and let them rest
in the covered pan for 15-20 minutes between cooking and serving. The
accompaniments can be prepared ahead (they keep well in a covered dish in a
low oven for up to an hour) or they can be cooked while the rabbit rests.
Scrub, peel and dice a generous 1 1/2 lb celeriac (this is the prepared
weight required; trimmings can be saved for soup). Steam the celeriac for 10
minutes or so until tender, and blot dry.
Peel and dice the apples and saute them for 5 minutes or so in a little of
the butter. Mash the two ingredients together roughly: aim for a texture
closer to good knobbly tweed than potato puree. Add the rest of the butter.
Season with sea salt, mustard, pepper and most of the freshly-toasted and
lightly-crushed cumin seed.
Drain the hot, poached rabbit for serving, lay it on the bed of vegetables
and sprinkle it with the rest of the cumin and a little chopped parsley.
RABBIT BRAWN (serves 6-8) Ingredients: the forequarters of both rabbits and
some of the saddle, prepared and cooked as described above; all the cooking
liquor; 6-8 oz cooked gammon or ham carved from the bone in 1/2 inch-thick
slices; 1 slightly rounded tablespoon gelatine powder; 3 tablespoons
freshly-chopped coriander leaves; the finely-grated zest of a lemon; a few
green peppercorns.
Method: Leave the poached rabbit in the cooking pot until cold, then strip
the meat from the bones (there should be 6-8 oz of flesh). Wrap the flesh to
keep it moist and chill it. Return the bones to the pot (together with any
bones saved from the other recipe) and simmer very gently, without a lid,
until the stock is flavoured intensely and reduced to 1 1/2 pt.
Strain the liquid, dissolve the gelatine in it and cool, then chill it until
syrupy and approaching setting point. Spoon a little into 6-8 small
ramekins, just enough to cover the bottom of each dish. Add a pinch of
chopped coriander and refrigerate until set.
Meanwhile, cut the rabbit meat into small quills and dice the gammon or ham.
Mix the meats in a large bowl with the remaining coriander, the lemon zest,
the bruised green peppercorns and the rest of the cool syrupy stock.
Divide the mixture between the ramekins. Cover and chill for eight hours or
until set. Unmould for serving, with a little greenery to garnish and
thinly-sliced brown bread and butter on the side.

FT  10 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Time to put a stopper to cork - It is humble,
archaic and prone to failure. Is there anything better?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT YOU are going to see will strike you as primitive. 'Is there not
another way?' you will wonder. 'Yes there is, and it will eventually be
implemented.' This was how the export director of the world's biggest cork
company prepared me for the second half of a tour that had not, even up to
that point, been distinguished by sophistication.
Amorim &amp; Irmao's cork processing plant just south of Oporto in Portugal is a
hangar the size of 16 football pitches. Hanging in the dark rafters is the
sweet smell of boiling cork bark for, before anything else happens to it,
each man-sized strip of bark is boiled for 90 minutes in ancient, blackened
cauldrons to soften it and, it is hoped, eliminate the harsh elements and
any taints.
On the rough earth floor are steaming piles of cork bark, covered with
patches that can look alarmingly like mould. After drying, these coarse
strips of bark are then picked over by keen-eyed factory workers, graded,
and neatened up, just as they were a century ago, in preparation for the
next stage in the process: the manual, popgun punching of corks from strips
of bark which Antonio Affonso de Barros is so anxious to modernise. All it
will take is a bank of laser scanners and an awful lot of Escudos.
The wine cork business is in turmoil, and it has nothing to do with how
corks are punched. The wine world is kicking up a stink about the
unreliability of its traditional stopper.
Modernists object to grappling with a corkscrew and a bit of bark. Everyone,
including those who mutter about cork trees being stripped too young, feels
that the incidence of 'corked' bottles - containing wine rendered
undrinkably smelly, presumably by a tainted cork - is too high. Some reports
put the incidence at one in 12, which is surely an exaggeration.
No more than one in every 50 to 100 bottles I open shows any corked
character, although I have noticed an increase in the incidence of 'cork
police' - as in 'this wine's a bit corked, isn't it?' And once the
suggestion is made, it is difficult to resist . . . especially if resistance
implies that your nose is less sensitive than the cork policeman's.
Research has isolated the chief suspect, a substance called TCA for short,
which results from an unhealthy blend of chlorine, moisture, mould and
phenols and turns a wine's aroma into an odour. However, it has also been
found in uncorked liquids, presumably as a result of chlorinated water and
less-than-clean storage containers, thus providing the cork manufacturers
with a little defensive ammunition.
'We are fully aware that the cork is a very unwelcome element in the wine
package,' Affonso de Barros told me, wearily, 'but look at the alternatives.
Is there really anything that can be made by machine, offers a reliable
seal, is inert to wine and is also easily extractable?'
Top contender on all these counts is the humble crown cap - the one that has
to be levered off beer bottles - so humble I am not even sure how it is
known in the closures trade.
It is considerably cheaper than cork but fails principally on aesthetic
grounds, probably because, I would suggest, the yanked elbow is an action so
much less elegant than the sommelier's current graceful arc.
The screwcap has the advantage of being resealable, but cannot offer a
perfect seal in the first place if temperatures rise. And the plastic cork
substitute surely combines the worst of all worlds, except that it should be
much easier to keep free of TCA.
The cork industry has been slowly wielding a new broom to push TCA out of
antiquated warehouses. Most producers offer hydrogen peroxide treatments in
place of the old chlorine bleaching which, as monitored by David Ramey of
Chalk Hill, one of California's most scientifically rigorous winemakers, has
virtually eliminated the problem of 'corkiness' now that cork producers have
reduced the amount of hydrogen peroxide used.
However, cork producers continue to offer both chlorine bleached and
hydrogen peroxide-treated corks, and according to Affonso de Barros, many of
the cork brokers on whom the wine trade depends have been slow to accept the
new, chlorine-free model.
Amorim is also perfecting a special non-chemical heat treatment, although so
far this is available only for champagne - sorry, sparkling wine - corks.
I have long argued that the gap between the cork trade and the wine trade
was unnecessarily wide - too wide to permit vital communication between the
two. Affonso de Barros did actually spend eight 'fascinating' years of his
working life working for the other side, as a director of purchasing for the
huge Seagram organisation in Oporto and thus as a big buyer, rather than
seller, of corks.
He claims - but then he would, wouldn't he - that much of the problem lies
in wine producers' treatment of corks. They tend to be shipped around the
world in large plastic bags which should be stored within fairly narrow
ranges of temperature and humidity.
He has seen them stored under a hot tin roof in Australia, for example, and
would like to see cork cosseting included in the syllabus of all winemaking
courses. 'Many of these problems could be avoided if the wine industry was
willing to co-operate in depth with the cork industry by exchanging views
and taking advice.'
During current hostilities, this seems all too unlikely. But is the wine
trade really prepared for life without a pop?

FT  10 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: An undercover bottle bank - A new company
making wabes in wine storage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a bank open today more than 100 feet beneath the English
countryside. It deals in commodities from all over the world and holds, on
deposit, products traded by leading brokers. Its currency is not cash or
cheques, but bottles.
Protected by steel doors and concrete-lined walls, the owners maintain
strict security over their liquid assets - wine. There is more than Pounds
144m worth of fine reds, roses and whites in what is thought to be Britain's
largest bottle bank, the Corsham stone mine in Wiltshire, southern England.
Left dormant by its former owners, including the ministry of defence which
used it as an ammunition dump, the mine has been given a new lease of life
by a company enjoying a dominant position in the wine storage business.
Octavian, a bonded warehousing company, has shaken up the musty ranks of
Britain's wine industry through a series of aggressive takeovers,
culminating with its 1991 acquisition of Frazers, a competitor whose main
asset was the 33-acre mine at Corsham.
The company has since spent millions refurbishing the mine with
computer-controlled dehumidifiers, a truck terminal and underground offices.
That investment is beginning to show a handsome return: Octavian now holds
600,000 cases of wine at Corsham and a further 500,000 cases at its site in
Charlton, south east London.
Formed only a couple of years ago, Octavian's rapid success has raised
questions among traditional vintners about how such a young company could
command a large slice of the storage market.
The answer lies with the backers who have invested heavily to create ideal
conditions for storing wine. They saw a niche market for bulk storage and
decided Corsham was the perfect site. The mine had already been converted
into a warehouse by the MoD, which dug tunnels large enough for an
Underground train and installed its own underground railway, which now
carries wine.
Corsham's backers are led by Nigel Jagger, a millionaire financier, who
says: 'The wine stored here represents an important part of the world's
stock of fine wine. It is like a large safety deposit box and we operate
like a bank.'
Jagger, who lives in Jersey, made part of his fortune as an executive
director of Atlantic Computers, the subsidiary of the British and
Commonwealth Group, which collapsed in 1990.
His competitors in the wine trade say they are wary of an enterprise
controlled by an offshore company. Documents filed at Companies House show
that most of Octavian's shares are registered with the Reredos Corporation,
an offshore holding company with offices in Panama and Zurich.
With the backing of Jagger, Octavian has pursued new customers aggressively
and now has large commercial wine stocks. Some of the brightest New World
wines are lying in the darkness at Corsham, including 70,000 cases imported
by Edward Cavendish, the largest dealer in South African vintages.
Octavian inherited most of its stock from its sister company Cert, the
public warehousing group also registered with the Reredos Corporation and
backed by Jagger. Cert's influence over Octavian has left the storage
company more closely attuned with stevedores than wine connoisseurs, but
that has not deterred large collectors from sending stock to Corsham.
The Wiltshire mine has wooed customers from other companies but its rivals
claim it is winning new business only by undercutting the market price for
storage. Trapps Cellars, the London company where Christie's and Sotheby's
keep their stocks, has been one of the main victims. It has lost 20 leading
clients to Octavian.
Many London companies are thought to be under pressure from British Rail to
vacate railway arches which it wants to redevelop. Wine merchants Milton
Sandford, for example, is moving its stock into a disused chalk mine near
Twyford, Berkshire, which it is converting into a wine store.
Richard Sandford, the owner, says: 'London is becoming an expensive place to
store wine. I know one merchant who is being charged Pounds 23,000 a year by
BR for 30,000ft of space.'
Octavian has been the main beneficiary of the migration out of London by
some merchants. And the company says it is expanding into an area previously
dominated by Trapps - stocks held by private investors.
Such a move could change the complexion of the wine storage business,
according to John Davis, co-founder of Trapps, who claims: 'There has been a
contraction among smaller and middle-size storage companies. We will be left
with a few big players and Octavian will be biggest.'
But Jagger rejects such fears. Climbing up the main shaft from the Corsham
mine, he says: 'We have a perfect wine store. The temperature is ideal,
there is no vibration and no natural light. Anyone who cannot provide this
sort of service will not survive. The best news for me is that our
competitors are giving up.'

FT  10 APR 93 / What the President did not say: Bill Clinton sent his
Warrington letter to Dominic Lawson who read it carefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAIL TO the Chief] A fine American sentiment, showing appropriate reverence
to their head of state, whoever it happens to be.
It sounds much odder on British lips. But that is where it has been over the
past few days, following President Bill Clinton's message to the Rector of
Warrington. The British media gave effusive coverage to his statement of
apparent sympathy to the victims of the IRA's Warrington bombs. It even
supplanted from the tabloids' front pages the Princess of Wales' attempts to
console the parents of the murdered children.
There are three reasons why Britain's opinion formers have become so
enthusiastic.
First, he had the wisdom to make sure his deeply personal message got into
our hands before those of the people of Warrington. My copy of the telegram
was headed 'Attention News Editors: Following is the text of a message from
President Clinton to the Rev Canon J O Colling, Rector of Warrington,
Cheshire. Dear Reverend Colling . . .'
The second reason for our enthusiasm is Britain's strange attitude to the
US. We like to sneer about Americans but when their country shows any
recognition of us - such as awarding a British actresses an Oscar - we curl
up like a spaniel having its tummy tickled.
The third reason is peculiar to President Clinton, and his reputation.
During the election campaign he appeared to be sympathetic to the aims of
Sinn Fein. He stated that he, unlike, his predecessor, would be happy to
give entry visas to Sinn Fein spokesmen, such as Gerry Adams, to make
propaganda tours of the US. He indicated that he would send a 'peace envoy'
to Northern Ireland, with the clear implication that the US wished to impose
its own policies in the area.
Now we all throw our caps into the air because Clinton has denounced the
IRA. But has he? I have read the letter carefully: after all he sent it to
me, too. I can find no mention of the IRA. Not one.
'The recent wave of terrorist violence' is condemned, which could be said to
refer to the IRA, but equally it could refer to the recent murders of
Catholics in Northern Ireland. Later, Clinton shows his true colours: 'The
American people join the people of Ireland and the United Kingdom in
expressing their sympathy to those touched by these outrages, in believing
that violence from whatever quarter can never be justified.'
In other words, even in a message to the people of Warrington, the president
of the US can not bring himself to single out the IRA, the perpetrators of
the terror in question, for special condemnation.
We should not be surprised by this. Clinton still has the Irish constituency
at home to think of. And his main purpose, like that of many politicians in
this whole ghastly episode, is to show clearly, and to state openly and
categorically, that he is and always has been opposed to the murder of
children. It is a brave stand, and could lose Clinton the votes of child
murderers, but politics is about taking the tough decisions, saying the
things that people do not want to hear.
Should I be so cynical? We are told that the President was so moved that he
shooed out of the Oval Office his speech writers, and actually sat down and
composed his letter all by himself. Having read and re-read the text (in my
vain search for the three letters IRA) I have concluded that Clinton should
not let go of his speech-writers' hands in future. His own tongue is forked,
and he needs expert assistance to straighten it out, before speaking.
I have one other suggestion: that the next time a member of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary is murdered by the IRA, unless we hear similar effusions of
sympathy from Clinton, and from leading Irish politicians, we should
instruct our ambassadors in Washington and Dublin to deliver a personal
message of our own. It would say simply: you lot are stinking hypocrites.

FT  10 APR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The nation weeps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I ALMOST didn't watch last Saturday's Grand National steeplechase at Aintree
racecourse, what with the cruelty angle - the propensity of all racing over
jumps to smash and batter the animals.
The unintelligent, which includes everyone associated with jumps racing -
owners, breeders, trainers, jockeys, stable staff, officials, Jockey Club,
vets, farriers, horse-box drivers, bookmakers, sponsors, newspaper hacks, TV
commentators, paying customers and the man who holds the gun ready to shoot
the horses that are damaged beyond repair - have an excuse for watching the
Grand National. Their unintelligence.
In the end, though, I relented. I skimmed the form-guide hurriedly, scuttled
to the betting shop, placed Pounds 20 worth of bets, scuttled indoors again
and turned on the BBC. I am glad that I did so because as everyone now
knows, last Saturday's Grand National produced the biggest cock-up - a
spectacularly British cock-up - in the history of professional sport.
I laughed until the tears ran. I haven't felt so uplifted since the fall of
Saigon. I loved every minute of it, especially the way that the BBC
anchorman - Des or Les or something: the one who stares out at us as though
he personally owns the TV rights to all major sports events - slipped deeper
and deeper into the vocabularly of petulance as the magnitude of the fiasco
impressed itself upon him.
At one level, Saturday's cock-up, which provoked a gale of world-wide
mockery, ought to prove a morale-booster for the animal rights and
anti-cruelty protesters. As they are doubtless aware, the fiasco has played
into their hands by spotlighting the rotten foundations with which the Grand
National, an anachronistic hold-over from the 19th century, is underpinned.
The protesters have got the toffs who rule and run racing firmly in their
sights. But they must squeeze the trigger carefully. They must woo public
opinion by concentrating on the hundreds of racehorses (no-one knows how
many) that die prematurely as a result of injury at the racetrack.
Much more importantly, the cock-up supports my belief, advanced two weeks
ago, that the events of recent months - above all, the recession - have
exposed our institutions to such ferocious scrutiny that life in Britain
will never be the same again. It may not get much better. But I believe it
will be different.
Take the Grand National, which is an institution of a sort. It is probably
the world's most famous horserace. But it is really made of cardboard. If
you watched TV last Saturday you will have noticed, in the background, a
succession of ashen-faced toffs, resplendent in trench-coats, hatted and
binoculared, marching backwards and forwards, deeply and bitterly ashamed of
the fiasco they had caused - but powerless to halt the crashing juggernaut.
Naturally, the spin-doctors at the Jockey Club and the hapless managers of
Aintree racecourse are trying to put a constructive gloss on things. And
there will be a vicious competition to pass the blame.
But they won't fool anyone - not when the BBC broadcast is flashing, at the
speed of light (6 trillion miles per year), out into the galaxy, so that all
those extraterrestrials who live near far-flung stars will eventually enjoy
the spectacle we enjoyed last Saturday. 'Great show from Earth tonight,'
says a four-headed version of Des or Les, 'the 1993 Grand National from
Aintree, England, on planet Earth. Make sure you stay tuned, it's out of
this world.'
So far, the only major British institution to have undergone at least minor
reform is the monarchy, at whose apex Queen Elizabeth II, that well-known
racehorse owner, has graciously consented to pay a dollop of income tax. But
the House of Windsor has lost its mystique. With luck, the monarchy will be
modernised further, and greatly cut back.
I have no religious beliefs whatsoever. But I do have an Easter message,
which goes like this: do not cast yourselves down, or weep and rend your
clothes; reform is in the air; the recession is lifting, at least
momentarily; things will get slightly better before they get far worse; our
institutions are teetering.
If you enjoyed the Grand National, you will love what is to come.

FT  10 APR 93 / The woman who built the Umbrella: Alastair Macaulay talks to
Val Bourne, artistic director of Dance Umbrella - Interview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Dance Umbrella is the world's largest and longest-running festival
of modern dance. Audiences go to see new kinds of physicality, and a
presentation of the human body that is more 'democratic' or less stylised
than that of ballet or other dance traditions. Pointe shoes are almost never
seen, Doc Martens and bare feet often. Few of the Umbrella's dances tell
stories, and not many respond to music. Virtuoso technique is rarely the
point.
An average Umbrella will include mixed-media dance theatre, minimalist
dance, dance improvisation, multicultural dance, dance inspired by clubs or
street dance or just by everyday pedestrian movement. Plenty of it will make
a marked effect out of its treatments of women (and, maybe, men); some of it
will make other conceptual points; most of it will provoke widely differing
reactions.
The Umbrella occurs mainly in small auditoria: Riverside Studios, the Queen
Elizabeth Hall, the Place, the ICA Theatre, and more. Yes, this is the
fringe - but, since the festival began in 1978, its influence has percolated
through the British arts. Umbrella choreographers have gone on to work for
the Royal Ballet, the RSC, the National Theatre, the Royal Opera and English
National Opera, and for comparable companies abroad. There is still
controversy - where there once were complaints about 'lunatic fringe'
experimentation, now there are groans about 'the lack of the new' - but the
Umbrella has become a valuable part of the British dance firmament.
One woman, Val Bourne, has directed the Umbrella since 1978. She has seen
the whole emergence of modern dance in Britain. She was at the Royal Ballet
School in the 1950s, danced with Sadler's Wells Opera for three years, and,
after a spell of other work, came back to dance as a publicist.
'The company I worked for presented Martha Graham in her seasons here' -
these were Graham's mid-1960s seasons that so impressed the British, - 'and
Twyla Tharp, when she was very new and radical and walked across the stage
and dropped an egg. I was very bemused by that.
'But I really wasn't used to modern dance then. And I remember seeing Merce
Cunningham, whose work I brought here last year in the Umbrella, and
thinking then that it was awful. Last year, when he and his company appeared
for the first time in Northampton, many people in the audience reacted just
as I had in the '60s - and I realised again that it just takes time for
people to get used to new dance. It wasn't until the '70s that the penny
dropped for me and I started to love Merce's work.'
Meanwhile Bourne became press officer to Ballet Rambert just at the time it
changed identity and became a modern-dance company.
'Martha Graham, Twyla Tharp, and the Rambert really were my first taste of
modern dance. It was really the Rambert, with which I worked for eight
years, that fired me. I did become very enthusiastic about the modern-dance
works the company took in then, and I was enthused by the people. These were
the first intelligent dancers I had met] The people who had stayed with
Rambert had had a very clear choice. They could have taken ballet jobs
elsewhere; but they'd chosen to stay and do new ways of moving.'
'The first Umbrella was to have been just a one-off. I was then working for
Greater London Arts, and someone who'd been to New York and seen all the new
dance in an Umbrella season there, came back and suggested 'Why don't we do
that here?' So I planned a festival that would present just about everyone
then making dance on the London fringe. As it happened, the ICA had
organised a season of the leading New York post-modern dance choreographers
for the same time, so we brought that in too. Anyway, the season was
successful enough for people to want another. Since 1980, it's become an
annual festival.'
It is debatable whether much of the fare presented under Dance Umbrella is
dance. Plenty of it involves speaking, some could belong as part of the
London Mime Festival, much of it is multi-media. Is this a problem for
Bourne?
'No, definition is not a big issue for me really. There are parameters -
cases where you think people can't or won't make dances. In one case, a
choreographer was to have made a dance piece for us. Only when it came to
doing the publicity did we realise that it was basically intended as a play.
But if it's on the cusp. I'm fine about that.
'In general, labels frighten me. They talk of post-post-modern dance now]
But let's put it the other way - I wouldn't want to be mainstream.'
'I was watching Kurosawa's film Ran - and the way it shows those armies
moving across the screen is choreography. Well, if I could have Ran in the
Umbrella, I would.'
I am curious about her own dance training, which was in the mainstream: ie
ballet.
'I began dancing in Calcutta. My best friend, Veronica, who later married
the conductor Alexander Gibson, took ballet classes there, and I decided to
do the same. I was 11 or 12, and we were taught by a Russian woman who had
more passion than teaching ability - she had us do virtuoso steps like
fouette turns very early on, I remember.'
Why Calcutta? 'I was born just before the War, in Burma; my father was in
shipping. When we came to England, I went on studying ballet - and Greek
dance.
'I was a serious child, and I was bright, and my parents weren't too keen on
the importance I gave to ballet. Going to the Royal Ballet School was a big
shock. It was like going into the army. You really were a student there, and
very regimented. My two years there were very interesting because I'd been
brought up in the Calvinist tradition that if you worked hard enough, you'd
get where you wanted. But at the School I suddenly realised that there was
another element: talent. I was never going to be anything better than a swan
or a wili all my life. I had a friend, who was lazy but talented. I'd watch
her, and I'd just realise that I could kill myself with hard work but she
could dance me off the stage. That was a very hard lesson to learn.'
Is it possible that Bourne's subsequent interest in modern and fringe dance
has been some sublimation of her awareness that she would not make it as a
ballerina?
'I don't know. To be honest, there wasn't anything else then, there was a
huge vacuum. People often ask 'Don't you take classes for pleasure now?' But
the answer has always been 'No'. Ballet classes for me were a means to an
end.
'When Rambert became a modern-dance company, we found that the loyal ballet
audience came for the first year and didn't come back. So we had to find new
viewers. We toured a lot to towns with university audiences - Warwick,
Oxford, Exeter, Southampton - and we decided that the most positive way was
with young people who had as yet no preconceived ideas about what dance was.
And we did attract young audiences; they did enjoy it.
'For the first years of the Umbrella, we also attracted people mainly
between the ages of 18 and 25. But we've just received the results of our
latest survey, which says that our audiences now are mainly between 25 and
40. That's very interesting, but it's also quite a shock.
'Students aren't coming the way they used to. That may be because they can't
afford to; but today's students are also more conservative. Just look at the
way they dress; they don't espouse causes any more; they want to know 'If I
don't like it, can I get my money back?''
And funding?
'In 1978, we funded the whole festival on Pounds 5,000 from the Arts
Council, plus a similar sum from GLAA, which also then paid my salary, the
postage, and so on. On that we managed to presented 12 companies and four
soloists. Today we have a core fund from the Arts Council of Pounds 148,000,
on top of which we need to raise a further Dollars 200,000. Well, this year
the Umbrella has received the Prudential Award for the Arts, which is Pounds
100,000.
How does the Umbrella present itself to the uninitiated?
'A lady from IBM recently pointed out to us 'Most people haven't a clue what
to come to. People need to be directed.' That's true, I realise. A boyfriend
who educated me in American literature used to say 'You've dealt with
Hemingway, now deal with Faulkner.' So we should offer a No 2 route to the
Umbrella, as in mountain climbing or skiing - to say 'You've done the blue
route, now try the yellow route.'
'I still don't regard Merce Cunningham as a warm bath. And that goes for any
of what the Umbrella presents. I still have to pay attention to it. In fact,
that's some kind of definition for what we present. I've seen choreography
in New York, and here too, that is very well made - but unchallenging. The
Umbrella should present work that is stimulating. If it's challenging, then
I'm interested and rewarded.
'We're freer now to choose what we want to present, and travelling to look
for new work is a large part of what I do. There are festivals here and
abroad that I attend, and I visit New York once a year or more. Sometimes
I've made the mistake of bringing a company to the Umbrella just because it
was the best thing I saw at a certain festival. A worse mistake has been to
bring over a dance to London when I've only seen the video. And often I've
trusted an artist, mistakenly, when I haven't seen the new work he or she is
bringing or making. Almost all of the mistakes are mine, because I'm the one
who does most of the travelling to look for work.'
Recently Bourne was made an OBE. I asked about the choreography for the
presentation ceremony.
'It was quite interesting, yes, but you didn't have much chance to make a
mistake. This man kept pushing me in the back, and saying: 'Three steps
forward. Turn. Two steps forward'.'
Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, has always said 'It takes
more than one to make a ballet company.' Bourne stresses that the OBE was
given to her as a way of acknowledging the area of dance she has served.
'I honestly think I was awarded it because I've survived, and because this
kind of dance has taken root, and because I was a woman. Mainly because of
the field, though. People thought that this kind of dance would just go
away, and it hasn't. It exists and it's flourishing.'

FT  10 APR 93 / A bloody battle that leaves few traces: Hugh Dickinson, the
Dean of Salisbury, says that science cuts itself off from the more profound
questions that religion, at its best, seeks to address
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS article on page I, AC Grayling strives to draw our attention to a
dastardly attack on the holy citadel of science by the evil forces of
religion. But it is an interesting exercise to swap 'religion' for 'science'
throughout his article and see how much sense it might make.
I read it with great interest, having just returned from a library where I
had been searching for a book in a section listed as 'religion and science'
and containing several hundred titles. There was no blood dripping from the
shelves. Most of them are thoughtful and reflective dialogues between highly
intelligent scholars, philosophers, scientists and theologians. Of
Grayling's bloody battle, there is little trace.
What is going on? I am not so concerned about the present state of play
between scientists and theologians or philosophers. I am intrigued to know
what is going on when such passion erupts suddenly to paint a picture of
heightened drama worthy of Goya himself.
Some years ago, Liam Hudson suggested in Contrary Imaginations that the
human imagination can be divided broadly into two distinct types, convergent
and divergent. Convergers tend to see things in black and white. They are
either/or people and believe there is One Right Answer. They get things
done, looking neither to right nor left. They analyse, sort and list.
Divergers tend to be lateral thinkers. They make connections, thrive on
metaphor, are tolerant of ambiguity and tend to see things in shades of
grey. They invent but cannot finish the washing-up.
Fundamentalism is convergence driven by passion. It is a highly effective
weapon, as Mrs Thatcher and the Ayatollah Khomeini both demonstrated so
ably. Driven by passion, it trips over into fanaticism and become an
ideology. Soon, the ideological map becomes more important than the actual
terrain. Reality is distorted or simplified by theory.
Mercator's Projection flattens out a three-dimensional globe on to a
two-dimensional page and then, at the top and the bottom of the old atlas,
the Arctic and Antarctic were rent asunder. What is the passion which drives
the ideological cartographer of human knowledge, the human mind? Marxism,
monetarism, religious fundamentalism (Islam or Christian) and scientism all
are driven by passions which can be just as destructive as Grayling
suggests.
Religious fanaticism has done some dreadful things. Worshippers of the
absolute tend to adopt absolutist positions towards their opponent (yes,
there are always enemies]) and favour absolute solutions, including burning
heretics and anathematising unwelcome truths. I can only concur with
Grayling's detestation of such attitudes and actions. But distortion or
over-simplification seems to be creeping in when he proceeds to dump all the
values created and fostered, at least in Europe, by the Christian faith into
the same cesspit with the ayatollahs.
He accepts that science has not always been the friend of our race. But
that, he claims, is not the fault of scientists, but of the baser race of
politicians and merchants who have misused it or sold it for 30 pieces of
silver.
Science's reductionist and dehumanising attitudes to human values and other
modes of knowledge are not the responsibility of scientists, of course - but
of scientism, for which science has no responsibility. But swap 'science'
for 'religion' and a mirror image of the same defence appears immediately.
Religion is not to blame - it is those mad fanatics.
Either way, I am inclined to think there is no such thing as religion or
science. Science is what scientists hold provisionally to be true as a
community; it is what they write and the disciplines of their art. It can go
grotesquely astray - witness the sorry history of plate tectonics between
1900 and 1960. But scientists, like theologians, are men and women, many of
them deeply religious and finding deep religious significance in their
scientific work.
Professor John Polkinghorne is not a solitary swallow but, if the bookshelf
is any evidence of recent trends, one of an increasing flock of highly
intelligent men and women who migrate easily across two hemispheres which
make a single globe. They resist its polarisation into hostile camps.
Fundamentalism is, essentially, paranoid. It thrives on the fear that there
are Enemies Out There bent on destroying the Holy of Holies. In the heyday
of its imperial glory, Islam was far more tolerant than its beleaguered
people can bear to be today. It seems strange that some scientists should be
feeling like that, too.
I have acknowledged the shameful pages of Christian history but, for all
that, I cannot abandon the moral and spiritual profundities of this faith
which address the motivations of the human heart in a way that science never
can. If scientific knowledge has been misused to poison the ecosphere and
massacre large chunks of the human race, is the remedy more likely to be
found with Francis or Schweitzer, with Bishop Tutu and Martin Luther King,
with Gandhi and Jesus - or with the Cavendish Laboratory or MIT?
In its aggressively materialist mode, science cuts itself off from what
Polanyi urged so eloquently upon it: the acceptance and valuing of personal,
moral and spiritual knowledge as essential parts of our humanity. I am
deeply grateful for my microwave oven and for penicillin, without which I
would not be alive; but even if Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge physicist,
comes up with a Big Toe (Theory of Everything), it would not answer those
more profound questions about the Mysterium Tremendum which religion, at its
best, seeks to address.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: French look to a new era - The prospects for arts
minister Jacques Toubon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUMPTUOUS 18th-century corridors of the French culture ministry at the
Palais Royal in Paris have been bustling with activity as Jack Lang, the
former arts minister, moved out and Jacques Toubon, his successor, moved in.
It is the end of an era for the arts in France. Lang, 53, with his curly
locks and Thierry Mugler suits, has dominated the cultural scene for nearly
a decade with his innovative policies, big budgets, lavish promotions and
the grands projets, his monuments to modern architecture. Liberation, bible
of the French intelligentsia, even dubbed the 1980s - l'epoch Lang, the Lang
era.
What happens now? Will the new conservative government provide the same
level of financial support as the socialists? How will the arts be affected
by the austerity measures announced by Edouard Balladur, the new prime
minister? And how will Toubon match up to Lang?
Toubon does, at least, want the job. Francois Leotard, culture minister in
the last conservative government from 1986 to 1988, reluctantly accepted the
portfolio only after President Francois Mitterrand had blocked his
appointment as defence minister, the post he holds in the new cabinet.
But the gregarious Toubon, 51, a casino croupier's son from Nice who entered
politics from the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, is an arts
enthusiast. He is also a confidant of Jacques Chirac, prime minister in the
last conservative administration and now mayor of Paris, where he rivals
even Lang in the extravagance of his arts budget.
Toubon made an early play for the culture ministry by writing the
conservatives' arts manifesto, beating off competition for the job from
Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, and Bernard-Henri Levy, the 'pop'
philosopher.
The new minister's enthusiasm may not be enough. The chief concern of the
arts community is the fate of the cultural budget, which rose rapidly in
l'epoch Lang from 0.47 per cent of government expenditure in 1981, when Lang
took office, to 0.98 per cent last year. Traditionally the conservatives
have cut the budget. It fell from 0.93 per cent when Leotard arrived in 1986
to 0.81 per cent when he left in 1988.
Lang was lucky. He presided over the culture ministry when the French
economy was booming. Toubon is less fortunate. The economy is now sluggish
and the conservatives have inherited a FFr226bn (Pounds 28.35bn) budget
deficit. Balladur has asked his new cabinet to save FFr20bn from annual
expenditure, some of which must come from the arts.
Which areas will be most vulnerable? The grands projets are now completed.
The only exception is the FFr7.2bn Tres Grande Bibliotheque, the
controversial new national library designed by Dominique Perrault, which is
still a hole in the ground. But Lang has already spent FFr4bn digging the
hole, and Toubon has conceded that it will go ahead.
However, there are likely to be far fewer new schemes. The Opera Bastille
may find it difficult to persuade the conservatives to fund its plans for a
1,100 seat auditorium to stage smaller productions. The final phase of the
FFr5.6bn Grand Louvre scheme, which involves renovating and extending the
galleries of the Louvre museum and the neighbouring Musee des Arts
Decoratifs, could also be curtailed.
Toubon has hinted that the conservatives may cut contributions to the
running costs of arts institutions, particularly in Paris. The Opera
Bastille's FFr520m state subsidy may be vulnerable as the new opera has been
clouded by controversy and lack-lustre reviews.
The cuts could pose problems for some institutions. The conservatives will
encourage them to raise extra money from corporate sponsorship. But French
industry is now under financial pressure. Moreover, many big arts sponsors
are state-controlled companies which may be less generous once they are sold
off in the conservatives' privatisation programme.
Toubon will do his best to mitigate the damage, and one of his strongest
cards will be Lang who, although he has lost some of his lustre, is still
France's most popular elected politician. He also had the advantage of being
in power for so long that he had enough time to implement his policies.
A great deal will depend on Toubon's own status within the cabinet. He has
far less clout than his predecessor. Lang used the arts portfolio as a base
from which to build a cultural 'super-ministry' including media, education
and, eventually, the deputy prime ministership. Toubon only has the arts
brief.
Toubon's personal position is also more precarious. Lang had the inestimable
advantage of being a favourite of President Mitterrand. The new arts
minister's chief ally, Chirac, is not even in the cabinet, having gambled
that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential elections will be better
if he stays outside the government.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Poor tilt at Don Quixote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE FULL-LENGTH Don Quixote
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a compendium of classical improbabilities laid at the door of Cervantes - is
no stranger to our ballet repertory. Ballet Rambert acquired an intelligent
small-scale production in 1962. Festival Ballet showed a rather grander and
jollier version in 1970. In 1966, Rudolf Nureyev made an excellent staging
of the piece as he had known it at the Kirov, and subsequently produced it
around the world. A few years ago Northern Ballet Theatre also proposed an
entertaining production.
Now the Royal Ballet has decided to acquire a Don Quixote. And,
inexplicably, has chosen the production which Mikhail Baryshnikov made for
American Ballet Theatre in 1978. Everyone has had their way with Don Quixote
since Petipa originally mounted it in Moscow in 1869, and revised it for St.
Petersburg in 1871. In 1900 Alexander Gorsky edited the Moscow staging, and
this recension was brought to Petersburg two years later and serves as
source for most subsequent versions. The current Kirov and Bolshoi
presentations respect Alexander Gorsky's 1900 edition. Nureyev cleaned the
text, made it slightly more logical, and fired every company who presented
it with a sense of classic vitality and dramatic verve that exactly suited
his ebullient view of the old war-horse.
As it arrived at Covent Garden on Wednesday night, produced by Anthony
Dowell, with a new design by Mark Thompson and the merry old Minkus score
arranged and orchestrated by Christopher Palmer, this Don Quixote is deeply
depressing. Its chief fault is to mistrust the historic conventions of the
original. It looks uncaring of the text, of the historic relevance of the
piece, of the idea of a 19th century balletic Spain where artists can be
encouraged to play joyously with roles and with the dance itself. To make
sense of the choreography - even in Baryshnikov's charmless recension -
requires an appreciation of how national dance attitudes may be used to
colour classic rule, how academic propriety may be given a flavour of
pimento. Steps must flash. Colours must be bright, and passions brighter.
Whatever seriousness once obtained with the narrative, this has now given
way to a parade of dance cliches and received ideas, which must be newly
minted for us by vivacity in playing, by bravura, and a willingness to
believe in the mad conventions of the piece.
Wit is all, and there is not a witty thing in this production. Mark
Thompson's designs seem to me to be wholly misconceived. The first act
square in Barcelona is a claustrophobic construction of blank red and ochre
walls, embellished with a vast and skied statue of the Blessed Virgin, and a
suggestion of de Chirico perspective. The tavern is austere, unlikely in its
wild contrasts in size of barrels and bottles; the windmill scene is so
stylised as to make little sense. To 'modernise' an old ballet needs more
sympathy for its conventions and attitudes than Thompson shows, and his
costumes are massively unsuited for such a spectacle. Funereal black
abounds. Unadorned bodices, glum and unflattering shapes, and hideous
cutlet-frill tutus in the last act, betray the dance. The second act's
dryads are got up in windmill head-dresses and tutus, better suited to the
Lido than the opera-house. They are inexcusably crass.
The version of the score is hardly more appealing. Baryshnikov hustles the
action along, and Minkus is similarly streamlined. The score was never the
greatest of musical shakes, but the edition performed in Petersburg is
tuneful, sparkling, and its blatancies accord with the buoyancy of that
staging. Christopher Palmer's editing is efficient, yet rarely beguiles the
ear - and, in the final scene, is more vulgar than is appropriate.
For the artists of the Royal Ballet, as for any Western company, there are
huge problems in adapting to the stylistic demands of classic-Hispanic
virtuosity. The Royal Ballet's first cast, led by Viviana Durante and Irek
Mukhamedov, seemed bemused, and not a little uneasy - as who should say:
'Where the hell are we?'. They are in no way helped by their outfits, or by
the glooming designs. Nor does the staging - as production or choreographic
text - offer any inducement to gaiety.
The dance looks dull, the staging ill-paced, and the narrative, such as it
is, in constant danger of disintegration. Characterisations are, not
surprisingly, blank. As Kitri, Durante gives the last act duet a bright edge
of virtuosity, but her reading is as yet unrelaxed, without radiance or
generosity. Irek Mukhamedov, a wonderfully happy and engaging Basilio in the
Nureyev version with the Royal Ballet of Flanders, looks here like a man who
realises he is on board the Titanic. The rest of the cast apparently felt
the same: they could plainly hear the strains of 'Nearer, my God, to Thee'
coming from the pit.
Don Quixote is sponsored by the Linbury Trust and The Friends of Covent
Garden. It is in repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Magnificent Titian, and other titans - Patricia
Morison is enchanted by a masterful exhibition of Venice's Golden Age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had
died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote,
'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice,
even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have
reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance
as supreme painter of Venice. And so began truly The Century of Titian, the
title of the magnificent exhibition which can be seen in Paris and nowhere
else.
It would be rash to prophesy that decades must elapse before there is
another comparable exhibition of Venice's Golden Age. Nonetheless, it is
certain that this exhibition had remarkable leverage in securing loans,
thanks to the prestige of its organiser, Michel Laclotte. For this last
exhibition before his retirement, the director of the Louvre has been
calling in the favours, winkling out important paintings which have not been
lent for over a generation, and in some cases have barely been seen this
century.
Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's
golden age, among them some of the best-loved paintings of the Italian
Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her
Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it
is his show alone.
The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983-4 produced not one
Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle. In contrast, Paris
offers an entire room hung with 17 Giorgiones, among them the mysterious
'Sunset Landscape' from London and the exquisite Laura, bare-breasted in a
fur-lined coat - a courtesan, a Virtue, or even, as some would have it, a
marriage portrait. As for the bitterly lamenting old woman, 'La Vecchia,' it
seems odd that anyone could think this is Giorgione's portrait of his
mother. However, the enormous catalogue (FFr390, Pounds 47.15) reveals that
this is the opinion of the Italian scholar, A. Ballarin, on whose views of
Giorgione and Titian the exhibition is more or less closely based.
But then, Giorgione is an endlessly mysterious artist. Hanging such a room
amounts to throwing down the gauntlet a dozen times - assuming that certain
paintings such as the San Diego 'Portrait of a Man,' with its immensely
delicate sfumato effect, are certainly by him. But whoever one plumps for,
there is no gainsaying the extraordinarily powerful effect of a wall of five
portraits of beautiful, narcissistic, moody young men, among them the famous
Gattemalata from the Uffizi and the hand-on-heart youth from the National
Gallery in Budapest.
The rooms which follow trace the influence of Giorgione, above all on
Sebastiano del Piombo and on young Titian. The hornets of controversy buzz
loudest of all at the point where the famous 'Concert Champetre' from the
Louvre is said to be by Titian, and the 'Susannah and Daniel' from Glasgow.
The unique pleasure of any such exhibition is to see wonderful paintings
hanging together, commenting on each other. The 'Concert' and the 'Susanna'
look less like Titian, to my eye, for being shown alongside the newly
cleaned sacra conversazione from Mamiano di Traversatolo. Here is the artist
of the Frari Assumption, totally confident in his harmonious grouping of
monumental figures, and gifted above all with the surpassing use of colour.
Separate sections on middle and late Titian include such rarities as a
portrait of Laura Dianti, Alfonso d'Este's mistress, and 'St Margaret,'
stepping out of the dragon's jaws while behind her is the view of a burning
city as brilliantly impressionistic as anything from late Titian's brush.
Interspersed are copious selections of other artists of the Veneto who fell
under (or in Lotto's case, rejected), the spell of Giorgione and Titian.
The Louvre has lent much, including the 'Man with a Glove'. Its 'Venus of
the Pardo' can be seen with the two triumphantly erotic mythologies from the
Prado, 'Danae' and 'Venus with Cupid and and Organist'. In all there are 150
paintings, and two rooms of 120 exceptionally fine prints and drawings.
Le Siecle de Titien is attracting some 4,000 visitors daily so you should
expect a queue. However, the show is spaciously hung which means that the
crowd soon thins out. Wastage is helped by the fact that there are
disgracefully few seats. This may be a mundane point, but it is nonetheless
a serious one.
Increasingly, doubts are expressed about the wisdom of exposing works of art
to the risks of travel. In the last analysis, then, the justification for
blockbuster exhibitions has to be the joy they give the public. So why, one
might ask, are curators the world over so indifferent to their visitors'
comfort? Le Siecle de Titian is, I am afraid, a classic example.
The labels are so small that opera glasses are a good idea. And if possible,
plan to visit more than once - not that there is a season ticket option,
which also seems ungenerous. At the least, husband your strength, for the
final room of the exhibition deserves not to be skimped. Hung against a
nasty royal blue background, are the unsettling works of four great painters
in their old age. Of Veronese there is the tender, quiet-toned 'St Pantaleon
curing a Child' and 'Christ in the Garden of Olives'. Counter-Reformation
spirituality speaks with a more troubling voice in the nocturnal scenes by
Tintoretto and Bassano. Among the masterpieces of Titian's final two decades
are 'Venus and Adonis' from the Metropolitan, the newly restored 'Venus
Bandaging the Eyes of Cupid,' the Detroit 'Ecce Homo,' and 'St Jerome' from
the Escorial.
Above all, there is 'The Flaying of Marsyas,' the painting which in a decade
of travel around the world has awakened a deep response in art lovers, few
of whom would ever see it at home in Kromeric in the Czech Republic. Surely,
then, it should have been possible to provide a perch?
Prestigious block-buster shows look set to continue despite the opposition
of hard-line conservationists. Indeed, their arguments look mean-spirited in
the face of an exhibition like this, which offers such a deep and rich
encounter with one of the most exciting periods in western art. And yet, at
the same time, it also underlines the need for curators to take a less
Olympian attitude to their eager but footsore public.
Exhibition ends 14 June; open daily (except Tuesdays), 10-8, Thursdays
10-10. Sponsored by ICI France.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Beggars can be choosers

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE IS a worrying quarter of an hour or so at the start of The Beggar's
Opera when one fears that it is not going to work. The scenery on the large
Barbican, London, stage is so intricate and pervasive, and the voices and
the text so thin, that it looks as if John Caird's production will be
overwhelmed by the set. It is only with Polly Peachum's wonderful air, 'Oh
what pain it is to part', at the end of the first act that you realise you
are watching what was once a theatrical revolution.
The reaction was much the same on the original first night at Lincoln's Inn
Fields in 1728. About 1,300 people turned up, including the first minister
Walpole, whom the piece partly satirises, for what was billed as a great
occasion. They took the opening coolly, but began to cheer as soon as Polly
got into her singing stride. The production ran for 62 performances, then
easily a record for a first run of any work on the English stage. John Gay
the author, and friend of Pope and Swift, made a lot of money out of it:
around Pounds 800. He became the Andrew Lloyd Webber of his day.
The revolution was multiple. The piece is a satire on Italian opera. It also
attacks the English upper classes for preferring foreign works to domestic
and shows that English beggars can have just as good tunes. As satire, it
suggests that there is not much ethical difference between a community of
thieves and a community of politicians. The Beggar's Opera was the
forerunner of the modern musical.
Much of the satire has been inevitably lost with time. I do not think that
it is anything like as good a musical as the Brecht-Weill Threepenny Opera,
which it inspired. But the RSC production should not be seen in that
comparative light. Here is a loving reconstruction of a once major work with
some modern embellishments. Ilona Sekacz, the present composer, has changed
some keys, added a few instruments and a touch of rock, yet it still seems
essentially faithful to the original. The distinction from Italian opera, as
the beggar says at the beginning, is that there is no recitative: beggars
can be choosers. Otherwise, there are some lovely lilting lyrics and a
remarkable musical variety. Gay originally thought that there should be no
orchestral accompaniment, but was rightly overruled and continues to be so.
Caird's production was originally seen at the Swan Theatre in Stratford a
year ago. The Barbican gives it the greater space it deserves. Exuberance
bursts out all over. If you sit in the front row of the stalls, you may be
directly subject to the charms of David Burt's captivating Captain Macheath.
Singing and speaking he has a marvellously controlled voice. Elizabeth
Renihan's Polly and Jenna Russell's Lucy are good separately and even better
together. The Beggar's Opera is a bit of an historical curiosity, but that
is an additional reason for seeing it.
* * *
The other new arrival at the Barbican, this time in the smaller Pit Theatre,
is Peter Whelan's The School of Night, which looked interesting but slightly
rambling when it was first shown at Stratford in October. It has become much
tighter. Possibly it is a shade esoteric. The author has done an immense
amount of research on Shakespeare, Marlowe, their contemporaries and the
darker side of the Elizabethan court. But the play confirms my impression
that set in with The Bright and Bold Design two years ago that Whelan is
potentially the best of modern British playwrights. Richard McCabe is now a
magnificently self-confident Christopher Marlowe, even when he is exhibiting
self-doubt.

<TEXT>
NOT VERY many years ago Easter regularly heralded one of the oddest music
events of London's musical calendar, the Wembley Country Music Festival. For
a weekend the North Circular would sprout signs directing the faithful to
the Wembley Arena where a gaggle of country stars would parade in front of
an audience dressed (in spirit if not actuality) in Marlboro man outfits.
Such an image of country music is offered by Slim Whitman, who regularly
toured the UK in the 1980s performing watered-down versions of his 1950s
hits. All these and more are available on the double CD 50 Original Tracks
(EMI 0777 7 8907824). Just how tangential to modern sense of country music
they are can be judged from the titles: 'Rose Marie', 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds'
and 'I'll Take You Home Kathleen'. In short, romantic balladeering.
Wembley has been discontinued for a few years. When it returns this
September, it will do so to a radically different world. Two things have
happened to country music: it has become hugely successful in America (where
it currently represents 16 per cent of the US market by retail value) and it
has rediscovered its past.
This history is the subject of three welcome histories of the genre put out
by EMI, Capitol Classics, by Sony, Columbia Country Classics and by Kenwest,
The History of Country Music. All are five-strong sets organised by decades.
Accordingly each of the Capitol set (which confusingly is numbered CDP
96841, 96834,97541, 9752, 97555) the Sony set (468119-4681123) and the
Kenwest double CDs (KNEWCD715-723) cover the 1940s to the 1980s. History
being what it is the latest sets in each series are the most dubious.

THE BORDER controls are gone and the EC has formed its single market. For
many industries the new Europe may mean a culture shock in trade and working
methods, but not in the business of classical music - surely the first
industry to have created its own single market, transcending all global
boundaries.
Those who complain that Maastricht will result in a loss of national
identity might like to consider what has happened here. Since the war
European opera companies have increasingly come to look and sound like each
other, a point that has become particularly striking with the influx of
Russian companies that still perform the way they always used to. It means
nothing today to come across a recording of an Italian opera in which the
total number of Italian principals in the cast is either one (Sony's new Don
Carlo) or effectively none at all (DG's Lucia di Lammermoor).
In these circumstances it is a losing battle to complain that the
performances are hazy on matters of style, however high their general
quality. The new set of Don Carlo, recorded in New York, is in many ways a
high quality product. The playing of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is
exemplary; the version used is the full five acts, with an extra chorus of
woodcutters thrown in at the beginning for good measure. The set aims well
above the mediocre standard achieved by the previous releases - Aida and
Luisa Miller - in this Verdi series.
Unfortunately the often-cut Act 1, a court hunting-party at Fontainebleau,
does not find James Levine, the conductor, at his happiest. French elegance
is not really his suit. In essence Levine is an unstylish Verdi conductor,
too up-front, too American in his determination to make every minor incident
smack the listener on the nose. But this Don Carlo stays within reasonable
bounds and it powers along with a convincing dramatic energy.
In the title-role it also has an important newcomer. This is the tenor
Michael Sylvester, already encountered at Covent Garden, who rises to the
challenge here to make a bright, youthful-sounding Don Carlos with plenty of
ring in the voice, some tightness at the top aside. (Is he perhaps an answer
to the question, 'What are we going to do when Pavarotti and Domingo have
gone?')
In the fearsome role of Eboli, Dolora Zajick sings with the vocal
electricity turned up to maximum. Vladimir Chernov as Posa is again Levine's
virile Verdian baritone. The disappointments come at either extreme, as
Aprile Millo's Elisabeth seems to me only marginally less wobbly than in her
previous outings in this series and Ferruccio Furlanetto's soft-grained bass
makes for an excessively weak Philip II. In his confrontation with Samuel
Ramey's imposing Grand Inquisitor there is no contest at all.
Perhaps it did not help that I had just finished listening to the same scene
in EMI's re-issue of its 1955 Don Carlo under Gabriele Santini. The bass
there is Boris Christoff - implacable, granite-voiced, truly a ferocious
exterior hiding a crumbling heart within, and very moving, too. His halting
comment 'She loves me no more' at the end of his aria could make grown men
weep.
For him and Tito Gobbi's well-characterised Posa the set is worth its
mid-price. But the rest barely passes muster. The style is right (no lack of
Italians here) but at a mediocre level of achievement. And too much of the
opera is simply missing. Record collectors in 1993 will be shocked at how
much Santini and his team felt happy to cut in those days - not only the
first act (Verdi himself provided for that) but sizeable chunks out of many
of the set-pieces. This is one of the great operatic scores and I want to
hear as much of it as possible.
For a good example of the current trend in opera recordings one only has to
turn to the new set of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. Great voices
populate the cast. (The tiny role of Lucy's companion - 'What do you say?',
'Why do you look around?', 'Here he comes]' - is taken by a singer who is a
notable soloist in her own right.) The orchestral playing is spick-and-span;
the recording quality is excellent. But the performance as a whole never
makes any special contact with the opera.
In the course of listening to this DG set I dipped into a live performance
from Berlin in the 1950s, led by Maria Callas. Maybe the comparison was
unfair, as performances on that level do not come round often, but very soon
I found it difficult to tear myself away. The character of poor Lucy and the
passions she unleashed came so vividly to life there that one felt compelled
to follow the drama through to its conclusion.
On the new recording everything is, by contrast, rather vague. Suffice to
say that Cheryl Studer sings the music of the title-role with much beauty of
tone and a virtuosity commendable in a soprano with a voice her size. It
would have been preferable to have a Henry Ashton with more 'go' in him than
Juan Pons, but Samuel Ramey offers recompense as an unusually lustrous
Bide-the-Bent.
In the crucial tenor role of Edgar, Placido Domingo is in his finest,
burnished voice; the conductor Ion Marin displays plenty of energy. But it
is symptomatic of the whole enterprise that they make nothing out of those
heartrending sequences in Edgar's dying moments, where Italian tenors of the
old school would stretch out the phrases and make the music really sing.
That was the true bel canto and it seems a world away.
Finally, a word of welcome - if that is the appropriate term - for the new
Pagliacci. This Philips set has been given a rough ride elsewhere, mainly on
account of Riccardo Muti's determination to rid the score of its traditional
extra top notes, although some unattractive singing from Daniela Dessi's
squally Nedda and Paolo Coni's strained Silvio does not help. The recording
comes from a live performance in Philadelphia and the singers evidently did
not get a second try.
However, as it features Luciano Pavarotti as Canio, many people will
consider buying the set and it is worth reassuring them that the tenor is on
good form with nothing to fear from having the microphones in front of him
at a live concert. So often tenors bawl their way through this music, but
Pavarotti never forgets that he is there to sing. The role, in short, is
gloriously, eloquently sung. He is our main link with the Italian tenor
tradition and we shall miss him when he is gone.

So Near So Far Joe Henderson, Verve 517674
What We Do Jon Scofield Quartet, Blue Note 0777 7 99586 2 7
Percussion Bitter Sweet Max Roach, GRP 11222
Dear Old Stockholm John Coltrane GRP 11202
CURIOUSLY, tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson does not consider the album which
won him the Down Beat triple crown of best jazz artist, tenorist and album
of the year, as well as a Grammy recently, to be better than anything he has
done since his first of many Blue Note dates 30 years ago. So the fact that
So Near, So Far, the follow-up to his Verve debut, took the number one slot
on the Billboard charts within days of its release in the US must be a
source of some dismay to him.
Where the writing of Billy Strayhorn provided the inspiration for
Henderson's succulent improvisation on Lush Life, here Miles Davis is the
muse and more astringent tunes that span the late, lonely trumpet player's
career, the raw material. Davis had the commitment and the 'tradition' which
enabled him to reach a wider than usual jazz audience, according to
Henderson.
That febrile singlemindedness is lacking in a number of Henderson's younger
peers, he feels, and even where the young pretenders stick to originals it
seems to Henderson that they aim to get in the way of a good tune: 'There
are so many beautiful melodies out there to be interpreted which so often
are brutalised,' he says.
It must be easy for Henderson to be disappointed by the inadequacies of his
younger peers - he is one of the most inventive yet restrained tenorists
around and the new disc shows him to be at the peak of his ever-mature
powers. It helps that the line-up is a mutual appreciation society. Drummer
Al Foster was Miles' spiritual intermediary during the great man's hiatus;
Briton Dave Holland, a Miles accompanist in the late 1960s, provides densely
woven bass lines; and John Scofield, whose alternately angular and blue
electric guitar shares the solo work, adds glowing depth in accompaniment.
The material, taken from 1947 to 1968, is not the most obvious of Miles
memorabilia but rather an essence which the quartet distills into coolly
phrased essential extracts.
The choice of Scofield (borrowed from Blue Note) for this date was inspired,
his metallic coloured chords giving cutting contrast to Henderson's deep
lacquer. His own new album, What We Do, is typically a more arty and muted
affair. Though the guitarist's regular rhythm section of Dennis Irwin (bass)
and Bill Stewart (drums) are a hive of industry, Scofield steadies them with
his knotty, understated solos. Tenorist Joe Lovano, light on his feet,
buzzes in and out of leader's tunes, widening the narrow openings left for
him.
On the reissues front, GRP has just launched its 'Legendary Masters Of Jazz
Series' with a cracking 1961 date from Max Roach and another of the same
period from John Coltrane. Roach is perhaps less of a legend than Coltrane
in that he is still with us and the truth about his dangerous and exciting
leadership is not questioned. On Percussion Bitter Sweet he pushes soloists
Booker Little (trumpet), Julian Priester (trombone) and Clifford Jordan
(tenor sax) to the cliff's edge. From Eric Dolphy's gulping harmonics on
bass clarinet to Mal Waldron's piano melodies, Roach thunders gloriously.
The validity of Trane's intensity was never questioned and has been much
romanticised since his untimely death in 1967. Dear Old Stockholm, which has
the tenorist backed by his favourite pianist, McCoy Tyner, and bassist Jimmy
Garrison but Roy Haynes deputising for Elvin Jones, provides some prime
examples of late Trane work. Restless as ever, and with the insistent pulse
of Jones replaced by the spreading rhthym of Haynes, 'One Up One Down' sees
Coltrane painting his sheets of sound, 'After the Rain' suspending the
rhythm to sombre and atmospheric effect.

FT  10 APR 93 / Records: The new troubadours - Folk and Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-FIVE years ago British poets such as Christopher Logue, Adrian
Mitchell, Pete Brown and myself started wedding our verses to jazz. A few
years later the Beatles and Stones were importing songs by Chuck Berry and
Bob Dylan and rolling their own. For the preceding half century American
blues, folk and rock songwriter-singers had set the pace. When the Woodstock
generation and British beats became parents, spoken and sung word-sounds
opened up. What had been pigeon-holed as folk, ethnic, R&amp;B and spiritual
genres overlapped more loosely with poetry, pop and, latterly, world music.
These (r)evolutions have been catalysed by artists, writers and producers of
many hues. Dylan has acknowledged how instrumental the 'spontaneous bop
prosody' of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg was in metamorphosing the
Midwest-suburban college boy Zimmerman into the wildly free-ranging
song-&amp;-dance man he remains.
'Talking New Bob Dylan', a song on the recent album History (Virgin 2703) by
Loudon Wainwright III, one of Dylan's most original successors, articulates
the perennial beginning-troubadour situation :'I had to stop listening/times
were too tough/Me being the New Me/was hard enough/You kept right on
changing/like you still always do/And what's best is - the old stuff/still
sounds new.' History sounds newer still, confronting harsh mid-life
realities with telling wit and unescapist fortitude.
Another stream of straight-talking lyricism is renewed in the Stormy
Horizons of C&amp;W populist Hank Wangford, with his resourceful and spirited
band. This recording (Sincere Sounds 004 - cassette Pounds 7, CD Pounds 11
from Frank Management, 3 Chesterton Road, London W10 5LY), is dedicated to
the golden aeon of hillbilly boogie 40 years ago, before the great divide
between rock and country was widened through fear, racism and sexual
suspicion. The music conveys Wangford's passion for Texan honky-tonk,
Tennessee Ernie, the Everly Brothers and the 'sweet sadness of country
harmonies straight from the Kentucky coalfields.'
At the same time it twangs in perfect - and frequently comic - tune with
current British gloom, as in 'End of the Road': 'I've had enough/enough of
the rain/enough of the cold/I'm tired of the nights/The dazzling lights/when
the wipers won't wipe/I've got cowboy craziness/burning inside/but I'm out
of pills . . . I could be warm /lying in your arms/So why am I here/with
another flat beer/I want to go home.'
After temping as a clerk in the City of London, John Baine felt that the
stage-name Attila the Stockbroker would be in keeping with his avowed
contract from the muses 'to liquidate the gaggle of grey lugworms and
displaced Martians who have held the UK poetry set-up in thrall for yonks
resquirming the same old nepotistical pretentious irrelevant gunk.'
Having spent a few years in punk and heavy-metal bands he was no more
sanguine about the pop scene, feeling in 1981 that 'rock has become largely
redundant as a means of communication because the generally inane volume
means you can't hear the words.'
Since then he has issued a dozen lucidly phrased albums and cassettes, the
best of which perpetuate his energy, humour and improvisational verve as a
performance poet, singer and electric mandola virtuoso. Donkey's Years
(Musidisc 107891, cassette &amp; LP Pounds 6, CD Pounds 10 from ATS, 6 Colebrook
Road, Southwick, BN4 4AL) gathers 13 of his latest hits, notably 'Video
Nazis', 'This is Free Europe', 'The Bible according to Rupert' and this
ultra-contemporary lover's complaint: 'Today I took out the rubbish/and
thought of you./ At the bottom of my dustbin/the maggots wriggled round and
round/like planes circling over Heathrow Airport./ Now and then/two larval
aviators collided in the crowded, circular, putrescent grooves of metal/and
I thought yes, this is us - /not even ships that pass in the night/but
maggots wriggling in predetermined circles/in the putrescent dustbin/of the
enterprise culture.'
Paul Weller, like Attila, is 34, but had formed The Jam at 14 and swiftly
built it into one of the most rhythmic, soulful and humanly political beat
groups in the world for the entire decade.
He goes on being one of the only big pop stars to pen hard-edged straight
verse as well as music. His recent recording, Paul Weller (Go] Discs 828
343-1) is, rather surprisingly, his first solo album. It intensifies my
sense of him as a more melodic, inventive and poetic guitarist, tunesmith
and lyricist, especially of love songs, to keep on trucking than anyone
since Dylan and the Beatles - with the possible exceptions of Peter Gabriel
and Billy Bragg.

SLOWLY BUT surely Harrison Birtwistle is gaining the representation on disc
his achievement deserves. Though The Mask of Orpheus remains too daunting a
challenge for any record company to take on, most of his important scores
are now accessible from one label or another; one of the most significant
absentees, The Triumph of Time, is promised soon from Collins Classics, to
be coupled with Gawain's Journey. The new NMC pairing of Meridian and
Melencolia I, wonderfully performed and recorded, brings into the catalogue
two of Birtwistle's most haunting and underrated works of the 1970s, scores
that begin the exploration aspects of the highly wrought Orpheus sound world
Melencolia I is a brooding study in string and wind sonority, setting a solo
clarinet against two string orchestras with a harp to act as pivot and
intermediary; a Durer engraving provides the visual starting point and the
progress of the music is slow and remorseless, with sudden passionate
flarings.
Meridian, on the other hand, is perhaps the most perfectly achieved and
sensuous of all Birtwistle's scores, a ravishing interweaving of settings of
Thomas Wyatt and Christopher Logue with instrumental interludes in which
solo horn and cello (long-standing Birtwistle protagonists) vie for
attention.
Between the two pieces is Ritual Fragment, Birtwistle's memorial to Michael
Vyner, the much missed artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. It is a
wonderful example of Birtwistle's matchless ability to create a compelling
drama out of abstract ideas; here it is enacted by the Sinfonietta with all
the concentration the piece and its purpose deserve.
Birtwistle may still lack a full-blooded commitment from any one record
company but Peter Maxwell Davies is well advanced on an extensive series of
releases for Collins Classics. Stone Litany from 1973 and Black Pentecost
(1979) framed Davies's 'Orkney period'.
The earlier work sets off from a sequence of runic graffiti on a ravishing
celebration of orchestral light and colour, full of iridescent textures and
spangled lyricism; Black Pentecost, a passionate protest against the threat
of uranium mining on the Orkney Islands, begins to show the symphonic
tendencies that would come to dominate Davies's music a few years later.
Sibelius is the reference point: the orchestral colours are sombre, the
musical argument densely detailed.
In an ideal recording the mezzo-soprano for Stone Litany would have a more
luscious tone quality than Della Jones, but her involvement and dramatic
sense provide more than adequate compensation, while David Wilson-Johnson
proves an equally attentive partner in Black Pentecost. The BBC
Philharmonic, thoroughly grounded in Maxwell Davies by Edward Downes, its
former chief conductor, plays both scores for the composer with impressive
strength and tonal resilience.
The main disappointment with Decca's welcome release of Byzantium, Michael
Tippett's Yeats setting written for Solti and the Chicago orchestra in 1989,
is the coupling; dedicated Tippettians will already have the same
performance of the Fourth Symphony as part of the set of symphonies put
together on CD by Decca three years ago. When several works await up-to-date
recordings - the Piano Concerto most significantly of all - a precious
opportunity has gone to waste.
For Byzantium alone, though, the disc is worth acquiring, for in this piece
Tippett regained the verve and immediacy in his response to a text one
feared had been lost for ever in the indulgences of his own libretto for the
opera New Year. His reaction to Yeats' enchanted imagery is consistently
vivid; however flaky the continuity and coherence of the musical structure,
the parade of images is compelling. So too is Faye Robinson's performance,
with Solti providing typically muscular orchestral support.
The latest in Collins' series of 'CD singles' makes two much praised recent
concertos speedily available. John Casken's Cello Concerto, written in 1991
for Heinrich Schiff to play and direct, emerges from this recording a much
bigger, more passionate work than it seemed at its first performance, and if
anything even more impressive. Its pair of movements is parsed into a
sequence of episodes each springing from a single poetic phrase, and the
work arcs towards its final section, when Casken uncovers a rich lyrical
vein that extends everything that has gone before.
Hugh Wood's Piano Concerto, a big hit at the Proms in 1991, seems a more
tightly integrated, carefully worked score than it did then, centred on the
set of variations on Nat King Cole's 'Sweet Lorraine' which forms the slow
movement and whose source is only revealed towards the close. The rest - the
propulsive opening movement, the jazz-inflected finale - offer effective
solo writing, without ever hinting at the kind of personal utterance that
Casken's concerto manages so memorably.

THE FIRST LIFE OF ADAMASTOR
by Andre Brink
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 7.99, 136 pages
TAKE LEAVE AND GO
by Karel Schoeman
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 279 pages
ANDRE BRINK, a writer made famous by a series of large-scaled, energetically
plotted novels capturing the violent complexities of South African life past
and present, here attempts something completely different. End-of-apartheid
fiction - moving away from anguished verismo or else didactic accounts of
political turmoil to new or previously neglected areas of South African
novel-writing sensibility - is already well into its first phase. Writers
are reclaiming 'personal' modes of utterance, re-examining history (their
own and that of the country itself), re-discovering a wider range of
story-telling formats.
In a fascinating recent series of Radio 3 interviews with South African
authors conducted by Christopher Hope, this point emerged again and again;
and one of its most forceful articulators was Brink. His migration from,
say, Looking on Darkness or A Chain of Voices to The First Life of Adamastor
is a modulation of form, scope, focus, tone of voice: the pessimism that
emerges from the juxtaposition of paradisal landscape and the comedie
humaine it has engendered, is essentially the substance common to all those
works.
The new book is a slimline exercise in consciously applied archaic style.
Brink found his starting point in the great Portuguese poet Camoens, and in
particular the Cantos from the Lusiads dealing with the transformation of
the Titan Adamastor into the rocky Cape peninsula as Zeus's punishment for
his obsession with the nymph Thetis. This is the inspiration for a new and,
for much of its course, freshly invigorating fable on the eternal conflicts
of race, culture and religion that have stratified South African history,
and the dark strands of sexual attraction that have constantly cut across
those politically imposed strata.
Adamastor is here leader of a Khoi - in debased South African usage,
Hottentot - tribe. One day he finds a white woman deposited on the beach, as
if hatched from an egg. In the ensuing tale of mutual incomprehension,
growing sexual attraction, courtship and downfall, ruin is inevitable not
only for Adamastor but for the whole tribe - a fair amount of it brought
about by the size of his own sexual organ, which increases with such
unstoppable rampancy that only a lucky painful accident solves the problem.
One of the madder myths to have fogged white relations with black Africa is
of the black male and his sexual equipment and endowment. Touching
symbolically on this and much else, Brink infuses his material with a
piquant blend of sophisticated naivety and comic robustness. Quite often,
unfortunately, the tone wobbles - it almost always does at diverse points in
Brink's fiction - in this case, into irritating cuteness. At times the
control of allegorical function seems threatened with debilitating artifice.
In the end, though, the author brings it off: a dark subject treated with
peculiar imaginative lightness.
A younger and less well-known Afrikaner writer, but one with a wonderfully
fastidious command of tone, texture and subtly placed descriptive detail, is
Karel Schoeman. (Unlike Brink, who has long abandoned Afrikaans for English,
he continues to work in his native tongue.) Tale Leave and Go, his third
novel, affords its own distinctive example of the newly expanded South
African approach to fiction. Set in a near-future gripped by civil war, it
achieves through the sustained finesse of its writing an understated
vision-in-depth of white society on the edge of the new era, and/or the
precipice: its tight webs of personal relationships inexorably loosened and
privileged assumptions about art and culture put to the test.
In the foreground the narrative is deceptively limited in incident: Adriaan,
a poet who has just published an admired volume, functions equally as
central character and witness to the disintegration of the social and
political fabric. Episodes of dream and fantasy, elusive yet beautifully
precise in patterning, enlarge and enrich the poetic and psychological
canvas, all the more so since at its centre there unfolds a disquietingly
pertinent examination of the very nature of artistic creativity and the
artist's role in a society convulsively undergoing change.
This novel, serious but never stuffy, subtle but never laboured, is, I
think, the most impressive to have come out of South Africa for a very long
time.

FT  10 APR 93 / Fashion: The multiples wake up to a new sense of style -
Consumers are more canny about their shopping, and British chain stores are
at last responding to that
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS, says Brian Godbold, head of design at Marks and Spencer, an
inverted snobbery operating on behalf of the retail multiples. 'During the
1980s people desired the glamour of up-market designer labels; now, in the
1990s, they derive satisfaction from good-sense shopping.' To be able to
say: 'Gosh, it's just good old Marks and Spencer' in response to a
compliment apparently makes us feel clever and slightly smug.
Being sensible does not, however, mean being dowdy. The compliments are part
of the deal. Women are trading down only in terms of price and label cachet.
They still want high quality and they still want good, fashionable design.
There is, in itself, nothing remarkable about this information - it is what
most customers would have said they have always wanted. What is remarkable
is that, at last, the multiples, which have long had the largest slice of
the British clothing market and a nice complacency to go with it, accept it
and are acting on it.
Two factors have come in to play. One is a new academic approach to market
research and a readiness to believe what it says. The other is a willingness
to use the information, to take what once would have been considered
foolhardy risks. The multiples have found the courage to lead the market
rather than follow it by employing the best designers whose instincts are so
good they cannot help but innovate. And they can get the best designers
because they can offer them jobs where growth and excitement can be
guaranteed.
'If,' says Mike France, buying director at British Home Stores, 'you take
The Gap as the doyen of the 'fashion-moderate' look, an area in which we
operate, it is clear that its policy of constantly up-dating its classic
merchandise is what keeps its customers coming back. For the designer, that
is a tough and endlessly stimulating project.'
Maintaining the perception that freshness and novelty are constants in a
store is even more important than before, says Diane Grant Davidson, of C &amp;
A. 'It is not a question of multiple purchases any more. The customer is
carefully buying one item and then returning the following week for
something to go with it. She must not feel bored when she comes back. There
must be excitement and amusement. We have always had to be very nimble but
now we are dancing a very intricate dance.'
All the multiples have developed similar policies in order to do more than
merely survive the new recessionary era of padlocked purses and cut-up
credit cards. They intend quite aggressively to increase their market share.
'We are,' says Brian Godbold of M&amp;S, 'chasing names like Joseph and
Whistles. While satisfying our traditional customer, we have widened our
appeal to scoop up the money which younger customers spend on fashion basics
 -tights, leggings, bodies, jeans, polo-neck sweaters, blazers, stretch
jodhpurs. These and other fashion basics are among our top-selling 25 items
and those top 25 items make up 10 per cent of our business. We had basic,
well-cut bell-bottoms in almost as soon as they were seen on the catwalks of
the international designers - and at Pounds 19.99. Once the
fashion-conscious customer knows she can get the foundation of the latest
look from us, at that price, why should she go anywhere else?'
If M &amp; S is chasing the smart, price-conscious independents, BhS and C &amp; A
are, in different respects, chasing M &amp; S.
C &amp; A, a specialist in throw-away young fashion, has for many years been
developing the older, higher quality working-woman Yessica range. 'The
little suit, the workplace uniform was a wonderful formula for women. But
that well is drying up,' says Diane Grant-Davidson. 'Currently, the impetus,
the excitement is coming from street fashion, the youth-cult, seventies
revival grunge look. Our designers have gone with that direction,
reproducing the look and providing all its basic elements for our youngest
customers and allowing its softening influence to affect the fabrics,
proportions and details of the rest of the merchandise.'
BhS, on the other hand, a company which three years ago was suffering severe
financial difficulties, has significantly increased its share of the market
by, in the aftermath of his frustrated departure from the Storehouse group,
accepting Sir Terence Conran's legacy and adopting the policies so doggedly
resisted by management during his tenure there.
It has discarded the dull and banal and embraced both fashion and good
design. Its clothes for teenagers are at the cutting edge of youthful
fashion, while its grown-up basic wardrobes for women and men are stylish
and fashion-influenced.
'Our customer,' says Liz Broughan, BhS buying director of womenswear, 'was
into long skirts so fast you would not believe it. After the 1980s the
customer has become very confident. She is educated in fashion, in what
suits her, in the appearance she wants to present. And she is very
independent-minded about it. Many remember the long skirt from the
mid-eighties, of course, and know that it need not look 'frumpy', merely
pretty - like the Ralph Lauren prairie skirt, for instance.'
When ex-Next boss George Davies first mentioned demographics and the needs
of baby-boomers as the platform for the launch of Next, many arthritic mass
retailers mocked it as a gimmick. They, with their years of experience, knew
better. Heedlessly, they continued to patronise their customers. They have
been made to eat their dismissive words.
'Information is the most important tool we have,' says Brian Godbold of M &amp;
S. 'The fact that the population is ageing - by the turn of the century more
than half the adults in Britain will be over 50 - is on our side. Those are
our customers. But we have to be aware that the new 50-year-olds are not
like the old ones. They are much more demanding, much more fashion-aware,
much more critical of quality.'
'Most of our customers,' says Helena Packshaw, marketing director of BhS,
'work full or part-time. The typical customer has children and they are her
first spending priority; she finds it easy to justify spending on them. But,
on a shopping trip, she likes to give herself little treats: a cup of coffee
or a new sweater. If she wants it, she will rationalise the purchase in
terms of need.
'She also buys 80 per cent of the menswear we sell because she is very
style-conscious and wants to upgrade the appearance of the man in her life.
She wants him to look as if he is with her. Price might be critical in her
choices but it is also secondary. First, the product must meet her fairly
exacting standards of style and quality.
'The customer has money but she feels bruised and burned by the recession,
cheated and apprehensive. There is a feeling that no job is safe, that any
promises of recovery are not to be trusted and caution is the wisest course.
To persuade her to part with her money we have to meet all her criteria.'
The policy is easy to formulate; the merchandise is much harder to provide.
Only the designer can do that. Belatedly, managers and accountants have
learned to trust those exotic creatures whose thought processes always
seemed alien, more like instinct, whim and vague feeling than an exercise in
logic. 'It has,' says Brian Godbold, 'been a long struggle to be taken
seriously but now we have a terrific working relationship between design and
business, a rare confidence in each other.'
His department at M &amp; S employs 25 designers led by Sheilagh Brown, one of
the best-known and most respected designers of her (babyboomer) generation.
'We have no problem recruiting the best people because they can see the
potential in the business,' says Godbold.
In addition, he uses designers such as Paul Smith and Betty Jackson as
consultants. The department's function is to provide a design brief for each
buying group within the company and to work closely with the designers
employed by Marks and Spencer's suppliers. 'It means that, at last, we have
consistency across the business, a coherent point of view, and the trust of
the management when we move into the more risky fashion areas.'
For the last year or so, Godbold has been allowed to leave part of his
budget uncommitted so that he can respond quickly to a hot fashion trend.
'For example, last spring we bought Pounds 2m worth of gingham from a
standing start and had it in the stores fast. It sold out. We did another
Pounds 5m and then, when that sold out, went to Pounds 10m, which also sold
out, and then got out. The secret is to get in fast and get out fast. Last
autumn we did the same with Pounds 7m worth of animal print and at Christmas
we shifted Pounds 15m worth of tartan in a matter of weeks.'
The current revival of 1970s styles represents another area of high risk for
the multiples. They know that a fashion swing like this is so powerful that
virtually all the young will adopt it - but do the multiples, with their
vast floor spaces and their need to please all of the people most of the
time, have the 'street cred' to convince the young that their bell-bottoms
and crocheted singlets should come from the place where mum buys her
knickers? On the strength of their phenomenal success with leggings, polo
tops and bodies, they are sure that they do.
'All you can say,' says Helena Packshaw of BhS, 'is that the sharper and
more fashion-conscious we have become, the better our sales figures. We are
growing and gaining market share. We are 9 per cent up this financial year;
it was 10 per cent last year.'
Adds her colleague, Mike France: 'The present economic conditions will
prevail for a long time yet and the psychological effects of this recession
will be felt for a lot longer. Lazy retailers will not survive. You must be
innovatory. You must lead.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Fashion: Fancy dress goes with the job - Dressing for the
Professions / Advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOGETHER WITH a finely-tuned nose for the most discreet table in a
restaurant, a smooth way round the wine list and a liking for bruschetta,
what the successful advertising man needs is a chameleon-like ability to
adapt to changing moods and style. For nowhere does how you dress matter
more than in the world of advertising, where image is everything and the
medium IS the message.
Walk into almost any agency and you are made instantly aware that a vital
part of the potent cocktail on offer is style - and an essential part of
that style is the dress of the people who work there.
Not that anything so crude as an edict is issued - 'most people in the
industry,' says Jim Allman, director in charge of Unilever at J. Walter
Thompson, 'sense by osmosis what will and will not do' - for one of the
paradoxes of Adland is that in a world where dress really matters immense
freedom is allowed.
Paul Woolmington, managing director of 20/20 Media and a director and
shareholder in Delaney, Fletcher, Slaymaker, Delaney and Bozell (you have to
get used to these names in Adland) echoes the sentiment.
'One of the great beauties of this business is that we can express ourselves
more freely than, say, the banking community. We can buy things for work
that we are happy to wear in our private lives. We are ultimately
businessmen in that we have to sell our services successfuly to survive and
yet what we are selling is our creativity. There is a dichotomy, a tension,
if you like, that is always there. We have to look as if million-pound
budgets are safe in our hands and at the same time as if we are brilliant
enough to come up with an award-winning campaign.
'A certain chameleon-like quality is a great asset. My company looks after
financial houses such as Merrill Lynch, the Ministry of Defence as well as
food companies, Chrysler cars and Nikon cameras. It makes sense not to mix
oil with water. If I were going to see Merrill Lynch I would dress rather
differently from if I were going to see my clients at Sago, where everybody
is young and casually dressed.'
The great divide in Ad-land is between those who are known as the 'suits'
(all those in account management) and the 'creatives' (the copy-writers and
art directors) although every account director has also to look a little
creative, and every creative director has to look responsible and
businesslike. The days when you could tell the creatives by their jeans and
T-shirts, their pony-tails and Doc Martens have gone.
At J. Walter Thompson, for instance, Jim Allman says: 'Creative people dress
more conservatively than you would think and in senior positions often dress
much more like business people.'
Jim Allman himself is a 'suit', one of the new breed of international agency
men, in charge of global account (Unilever) worth millions. An American
married to an Italian and now working in London, his dress reflects his
peripatetic way of life.
'I am probably not typical of a London agency man,' he says. 'I have lived
half of my adult life in Italy and you cannot live there without it
affecting your aesthetic sense profoundly. My suits come from a tailor in
Rome called Ulderico Basili to whom I was introduced by my father-in-law -
this is much more for convenience and because I like him than for any snob
value. He made the clothes I got married in and his made-to-measure suits
cost less than most off-the-peg ones. My shirts are made by Il Portone in
Rome - another of my father-in-law's introductions.
'Basically I hate to shop and once I find somewhere that suits me I tend to
stick with it. Because I have to travel a lot for my job I can shop all over
the world. All my neckties, come from Ralph Lauren - I like the look, the
way they knot. All my sportswear also comes from Ralph Lauren.
'I buy traditional English shoes but I also have a favourite Italian brand -
Diego Della Valle. I like Paul Smith, particularly his casual things. Winter
coats are my great passion - I buy them from Bardelli in Milan and I have
them in grey, navy and camel as well as a green loden one from Austria. My
father never let me leave home without a white linen handkerchief in my
pocket and to this day I always have one, though now they usually come from
Jesurum just off the Piazza San Marco in Venice.'
Paul Woolmington is also a 'suit'. 'Typically, I would wear a suit but I
wouldn't wear a totally conventional Savile Row one. For instance I might
wear a slightly alternative pin-stripe by Armani which is looser and
slightly less formal than the conventional Savile Row version, but it would
still pass muster and is also very comfortable for all the charging around I
have to do all day.
'The creatives here are very smart. They would shop in the same shops that I
do but as their angle is being creative they will probably make it just a
little more interesting. They might wear a tweedy-looking suit by Margaret
Howell and team it with a tweedy waistcoat. The grunge look is most likely
to come via the creatives.'
Billy Mawhinney - an Irish George Best lookalike - as joint executive
creative director of J. Walter Thompson is very much a 'creative' but his
personal style is what he calls 'smart but casual'. Today, for instance, he
is in Hugo Boss ('though personally I prefer Jasper Conran to anybody') and
whenever he has clients coming to see him he would always wear a suit.
'Creatives, though, tend to wear them slightly differently - they may button
up the shirt and wear it without a tie and put on a brighter pair of socks.
I might wear a casual polo shirt under a smart suit. A few years ago a
creative would signal his separateness from the suits by wearing a sober
shirt and a bright tie. There is a feeling that you have to give your dress
some kind of presence - even if you just add a huge badge. There ought to be
something irreverent.'
When it comes to the women 'creatives' there tends to be a bit of
role-playing, a bit of fancy-dress - one day it could be rock-star style,
all leather and boots, another day Regency dandy. 'There has to be a bit of
theatre in what they do. For instance, a girl would not wear a power suit
unless she made a joke of it, sent it up a bit. The poorer they are the more
they play games with accessories.'
Charity Charity, an associate director and copy-writer at J. Walter Thompson
and thus definitely a 'creative', says: 'Put it this way, there is never any
call for sobriety in our dress. It's almost not playing the game to wear
anything too city or too sober. You don't want to look like somebody with no
passion or who has borrowed other people's ideas.
'As creatives we are supposed to be original thinkers so our uniform is one
of dissent. Clients seem rather to like it - they can readily identify us at
meetings, they know who we are meant to be. Personally, I would never wear
something like jeans - too conformist. Today, for instance, I'm wearing a
pair of antique Victorian lace-up boots, an Australian Bushman's hat, an
extremely short tight blue skirt, a matching riding-style jacket and a Voghi
scarf which is the longest thing I've got on.
'I often try to wear something seasonal - around Christmas I will wear the
family tartan, on cold days I sometimes wear ten petticoats, around Chinese
New Year it might be a cheong-sam and jade necklaces. I would never wear a
power suit, unless I diffused it in some way.
'Female suits go to places like Harvey Nichols where they probably use the
wardrobe advice service and turn up to look at a whole range of options
lined up for them, or they would shop at Nicole Farhi or buy Italian labels.
The colours would be brighter than you would find in the City of London,
they would not think twice about wearing floaty numbers - and they NEVER
carry huge hold-all handbags.
'They have to look neat and above all they must not look as if they are
shambolic thinkers. The clothes have to say they are dependable and reliable
but that they also have flair.'
In a world full of legendary snappy dressers - Charles Saatchi, renowned for
his Comme des Garcons suits, John Hegarty, the archetypal 80s Paul Smith
man, Robin Wight with his bright bow-ties and his silk waistcoats, Frank
Lowe and his Armani suits - the new name that is most mentioned when chat
turns to clothes is Graham Fink of Gold Greenless Trott. Given to Gaultier
suits worn without a shirt and to attending black-tie dinners in an
unconventional eclectic mix of his own, he is generally conceded to have the
looks and the personal style to get away with his idiosyncratic way of
dressing.
Mostly, advertising people's sartorial escapades are looked on with
affectionate amusement. Graham Fink may still be remembered for his eclectic
dinner suit but Charity Charity had the chutzpah to wear a Pounds 9.99
eau-de-nil satin slip from Marks and Spencer and 'some rather nice jewellery
from Granny' to an industry dinner - and nobody batted an eye-lid.

FT  10 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Making risky arrangements over the phone -
How can you make sure that the florist does what you want? Lucia van der
Post explains how to pick your words when you say it with flowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S EASTER . . . or Mother's Day . . . or St. Valentine's Day . . . or
somebody's birthday or a friend is in hospital . . . a 'floral tribute'
seems just the thing.
More substantial than a card, less fattening than chocolates, more welcoming
than hankies, nobody anywhere ever had too many flowers.
So you ring up the florist and ask for something pretty and appropriate to
be sent. You are profusely and warmly thanked but probably have little real
idea of what has been dispatched in your name.
You hope it was everything you dreamed of - an enchanting collection that
gives great pleasure but also speaks (but discreetly, of course) of taste,
style and generosity.
But taste and style among the Oasis set is a moveable feast. What once was
absolutely a la mode - the elaborate confections of yesteryear - are deemed
by the taste police of today to be as out-of-date as the power suit.
Artlessness and simplicity is what new-age floristry is all about.
Originality, too. No longer do flowers necessarily come wrapped simply in
paper and standard-issue ribbon - baskets of every shape and size, glass
bowls, even . . . in Elizabeth Azagury's case . . . an Hermes scarf all
serve to wrap and contain the flowers, twigs and foliage.
All the most sought-after florists are either going for simple posies of a
single flower or doing wild things with twigs and berries, fruits and nuts.
The school of floristry, first pioneered by Pulbrook &amp; Gould, which deemed
that 'fronds of cow parsley were as important as a stem lilies; where a
branch of blackberries enhanced rare dark roses; where a small bunch of
mixed herbs was more special than a dozen carnations' has won the day.
If you mind about such things how can you be sure of what is being sent in
your name? Generous or regular flower senders build up warm and loyal
relationships with a particular florist who gets to know their taste and
style. But for the rest of us, who resort to florists but rarely, it is a
chancier business.
To see just what some of London's best florists are currently offering I
decided to draw up a cast of imaginary but typical characters and ask each
florist to devise something that they felt would be just right. Photographed
here are their solutions.
*****
Rob Van Helden, 156 The Grampians, Shepherd's Bush Road, London W6. Tel:
071-603-0443.
We asked Rob to create something suitable for a metropolitan sophisticate -
a dauntingly chic successful business woman with an equally daunting
lifestyle, given to first-class travel but not to suffering fools gladly.
Always the first with the latest trends, she is a demanding customer to
please.
Rob's speciality is hugely generous baskets filled with interesting foliage
and sophisticated combinations of shades of white, blue and white or white
and pink. What he devised for our picky sophisticate is typical of his style
 -a chunky, reusable basket filled with glossy green foliage and a
combination of white hyacinths and tulips, interspersed with berries. Rob's
creations are most notable for their generosity - that is a very large
basket, brimming with greenery and flora, and all for Pounds 40, including
delivery in the London area.
Our picky lady would love the all-white combination (tres tres chic in her
circles) and she would love the fact that she does not have to stop and
arrange the flowers herself - she can simply put the whole basket on to a
convenient table and there it will sit looking chic, voluptuous and smelling
wonderfully of the country.
For those who want to send something smaller Rob also does simple tied
bouquets, or sometimes uses glass containers (again the collection arrives
ready be put wherever it looks best). He likes best to use seasonal flowers
and is particularly fond of single-colour arrangements - blue hyacinths at
the moment are a particular favourite.
His prices include delivery in the London area but, for an extra delivery
charge, he will deliver anywhere in the UK.
*****
Forever Flowering, Orchard House, Mortlake Road, Kew Gardens, Surrey TW9
4AS. Tel: 081-392-9929.
We asked for something to please a young girl - not a trendy, disco-going
metropolitan miss but somebody sweet and a touch old-fashioned, who dresses
at Laura Ashley and Monsoon, bicycles to work, has trouble making ends meet
and whose idea of a good night out is listening to Bach at The Wigmore Hall.
What arrived was perfect - an authentic traditional Sussex garden trug (10
in size) filled with nothing but pink parrot tulips. Delivered exactly as it
is, to any address in the UK it would cost Pounds 35 plus Pounds 5 delivery
charge. Orders placed before noon are delivered the next day. A larger trug,
14 ins size, costs Pounds 45 but prices start from Pounds 20. There are also
sweet little willow basket with low handles, brimming with flowers.
Or you could order a box of cut flowers tied with a simple white ribbon -
choose the colour combination you like best (Forever Flowers tends to favour
two colours: white and blue or pink and green).
As Forever Flowering points out, these make double gifts - the flowers are
beautiful and afterwards the trug or basket can be used again and again. It
can hold eggs or fruit or other flowers.
Forever Flowering specialises in simple, natural country flowers - 'If I
tell you,' says Sandra Rangecroft, who started it, 'that we NEVER use
chrysanthemums or carnations that probably tells you all you need to know.'
She uses mainly seasonal flowers - at the moment parrot tulips, hyacinths,
chincherinchees from the Netherlands - and one of her most popular
arrangements is a simply tied bunch of dried lavender surrounding a bunch of
fresh pale pink parrot tulips.
*****
Azagury, 50 Knightsbridge, London SW1. Tel: 071-235-0799.
From Azagury we asked for something to suit a nice, sweet, gentle Sloane
Ranger. She has a small flat in Clapham, her spiritual home is Peter Jones,
during the week she cooks lunches for the directors in a merchant bank and
at weekends she speeds off to see Mummy and Daddy in Hampshire and exercise
her horse.
Elizabeth Azagury produced probably the most stunning and original
collection of the lot (see photograph below) - our Sloane Ranger would be
very, very impressed.
Elizabeth Azagury had done wondrous things with contorted willow and
eucalyptus, with pink amaryllis, white lilac and French tulips. With
relatively few flowers she had created a very theatrical impression.
By some wizardry she had managed to put together even this dramatic
collection in such a way that all one had to do was undo the wrapping and it
was ready to be plonked straight into a vase. The final, witty, Sloane touch
was that the whole was wrapped in a beautiful pale blue, white and buttercup
yellow Hermes silk scarf. The arrangement cost about Pounds 25 without the
silk scarf - an extra Pounds 135 with it.
Elizabeth Azagury also likes using hot or acid colours and is currently
given to teaming fuchsia with purples and oranges. She is also rather fond
of lots of lime green. When she is not using hot colours she likes very
fresh ones (like the ones used for the arrangement she sent us). She also
likes flowers loosely put together, nothing too stiff or too formal, a
little touch of wildness never goes amiss - 'though it must be properly
balanced'.
She can only handle deliveries in the London area.

Caroline Dickenson, 5 William Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-245-9599.
From Caroline Dickenson we asked for something to please a lady-who-lunches
 -you have read about them, perhaps you even know one. She is addicted to
Chanel (what is she going to do now that Grunge is coming in?), her
favourite haunts are San Lorenzo and the Caprice. She lives in Kensington,
where her chief preoccupations are her nanny, her aerobics class and her
Pekinese.
Caroline Dickenson sent the vibrant hand-tied posy pictured left. A
combination of red anemones and orange calypso roses it, like the other
hand-tied bunches, arrives ready to dunk into a vase. Wonderfully tasteful
though all white and green arrangements are, it has to be said that her
brilliant colours made a refreshing change from the purity and simplicity of
the all-white school of floristry. At just Pounds 15 (including delivery) it
was good value for money. Caroline Dickenson finds her own tastes have moved
on to a much more dramatic colour palette - she now often uses flowers in
the sort of colours that Christian Lacroix uses in his clothes - clashing
and opulent. This is the direction the new, young florists are heading.

Pulbrook &amp; Gould, Liscartan House, 127, Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS. Tel:
071-730-0030.
With Pulbrook &amp; Gould we asked that they devise something for a much-loved
mother, the sort of person who has spent most of her grown-up years looking
after other people. Generous and unselfish, she has far too much to do to
worry about what is in fashion and what is out. When there is any money left
over she tends to spend it on her husband or one of her many children. What
she needs, above all, is a treat.
Just because she isn't bothered about what is in and what is out is no
reason to give her second-best. Pulbrook &amp; Gould pulled out all the stops -
white ranunculas, freesias, guelder roses, anemones and lots of thick,
glossy green foliage with some dark exotic berries made for an offering that
was at once ravishingly pretty and madly chic. A simply tied bouquet means
that the bunch needs no arranging - once the string is undone the flowers
are ready to put into a vase.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould report that there is currently a big vogue for simplicity -
where a few years ago they would have been sending proper bouquets these
days they find their customers like simple, tied bunches. These can range
from tiny little bunches of lilies of the valley or miniature roses up to
large bunches of roses.
They have always used a lot of foliage and they try, above all, to use
flowers that are in season. Though they have strong likes and dislikes they
would try, they say, to give a customer what he wanted - the more
information you can give the florist when you ring, the more you are likely
to be pleased with the result.
Prices start at Pounds 45 for a tied posy or a bunch like the one
photographed above
