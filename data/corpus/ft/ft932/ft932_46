FT  10 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A hard game to join
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECASTS that a work revolution in the 1980s would leave half the UK's
employed population beavering away behind computer screens in their own
homes not only proved hopelessly exaggerated but also under-estimated the
psychological difficulties of earning a living in the isolation of a private
house.
'Working alone at home is very hard, the hardest thing about what I do,'
says Michael Seal. 'When I can, I will move into a studio where there will
be some inter-action with other people.'
Seal designs and makes games from the living room of his flat in Brighton
and suffers from the familiar headaches of under-capitalisation and
competition from large companies with muscular promotional budgets.
'I often find that shops do not want to take a game that does not have a
large amount of advertising behind it.'
Seal studied architecture at Brighton Polytechnic but found designing
factory units for industrial estates was not intellectually stimulating.
Seal, who is 32, had long been interested in geometry, the relationships
between shapes and ancient Egyptian architecture. Artefacts in his living
room include a large propeller blade and a bullet-shaped fan. One wall is
made of a bookcase he built with a secret door and mock temples pillars.
In 1988 Seal designed a game called Altar. He cordoned-off part of his
bathroom as a workshop, constructing moulds out of card and wax for the
pieces and hand-carving the wooden board for the game which has some
similarities to chess.
His company, Seventh Seal, started selling the game in local design shops
and to the game shop chain of Virgin, to which he had shown a prototype. A
local company he found in Yellow Pages produced the fibre-glass resin pieces
while Seal made the boards.
He learnt screen-printing and packaged the product in the flat. The game was
ready in December of that year and for Christmas Seal generated a turnover
of just Pounds 500, selling games retailing at Pounds 30 and costing about
Pounds 8 to make.
In 1989, Seal fitted kitchens and constructed furniture to make a living
while he designed a new game, Axiom, which is now his main bread-winner.
This is a three-dimensional game made of cubes shaped with hollows and
bulges and, like Altar, is based on strategy with no element of luck. Seal
says turnover, largely from this game, has risen from Pounds 4,000 in 1989
to Pounds 20,000 in 1991 and about Pounds 30,000 last year, during which he
sold some 2,000 Axioms.
This turnover is generated from selling to shops at half the retail price of
Pounds 20 and to direct customers at a Pounds 2 discount from the retail
price. Direct sales are mainly at the Camden open-air market in London, a
weekend stall costs Pounds 60 to rent.
Seal, though, finds the business a struggle and not just because of the
recession. 'The game looks strange because there is no board and it can
appear very complex even though it is quite easy to learn.'
The packaging was a mistake: a slight upright box. 'That did not make it
look like a Pounds 20 game. I've re-designed the packaging now so it comes
in a flat box and looks much more substantial.'
Using Yellow Pages, Seal picked toy, gift and design shops around Britain,
visiting them to demonstrate the game. Reactions were often less than
positive. 'The Virgin people were very nice and took the game but some shop
managers will not sell games unless those games have big advertising
budgets. I was in one shop and a customer came in to buy a football and
bought the game there and then right under the nose of the manager. But the
manager still wouldn't take it.'
Seal's operation is too small to take advantage of cheap manufacturing in
the far east. 'It costs Pounds 2.50 here to have all the plastic pieces made
for one game of Axiom. I had a quote from Hong Kong to do all those pieces
for 33 US cents but we are not big enough to use that. Large game makers can
get their products made for virtually nothing and spend a large part of
their sales on promotion.' He advertises little except in the 'house'
magazine of Mensa.
Sales in the UK are not as good as Seal hoped but two German businessmen who
saw Axiom at Camden last year have bought 600 to sell in Germany and have
been discussing a joint venture in which they would sell the game in
continental Europe. 'Germans are big buyers of thinking abstract games, much
bigger than in the UK, so I have been hopeful about this.'
Seal has been approached by a large British games maker interested in buying
the rights to Axiom. This would scupper plans for a tie-up in Germany. But,
the terms the suitor has offered so far are not satisfactory. Seventh Seal
is also about to market a puzzle.
All Seal's income now comes from the business but it is only generating a
very moderate living for its owner. Seal would like to devote all his time
to designing games, leaving production to someone else. He also contemplates
the possibility that he might be forced to return to architecture.

FT  10 APR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Germany yearns for realpolitik -
James Morgan detects envy for Britain's policy of self interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS the time of year when we look to new beginnings, prospects seem
brighter. The Easter message of 'cheer up' makes tentative inroads on
today's all-enveloping gloom. But even so, the bleakness of the European
situation renders it hard to sustain even a seasonally adjusted upsurge of
optimism. Fortunately the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is there to show us
that many mountains may be no more than molehills. And its readers help out
in this endeavour.
Thus a Herr Klaus P Lucke wrote to the paper the other day about the
situation in the former Yugoslavia. He had noted that the attempts of the
German army to intervene in the local crisis of 1941 had often been
portrayed in an unfavourable light. The Germans had, it was generally
alleged, bitten off more than they could chew. But, wrote Herr Lucke, 'The
Yugoslav campaign did not last even two weeks. On the German side there were
only 151 losses to complain about. The French historian, Raymond Cartier
wrote in his standard work, The Second World War, that this campaign
occasioned 'fewer losses than a single weekend on the roads of Europe at
peace'.' The lesson is clear and I expect you are feeling better already.
But in the German press anything that cheers is counterbalanced by a searing
attack on what the naive might have supposed to be a promising development.
Thus the agreement of last weekend between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
occasioned some incoherent reflections from an embittered Hamburger
Abendblatt: 'The DM2.56bn approved by President Clinton is in fact nothing
more than the famous drop in the ocean when set against the 80bn Bonn has
shovelled into the East. But then the Americans did not lose the second
world war . . . Secondly in the USA there are no CIS soldiers for whose
removal Bonn would pay any price (sic). And third Washington is four times
as far from Moscow as is Bonn and is not so afraid of the collapse of the
democracy movement as is Germany.'
These long extracts highlight a problem facing western Europe today - what
is Germany for? The old West Germany had a clear role: a milch cow, an Aunt
Sally to be knocked down by references to its unsavoury predecessor and a
good friend in time of need. A mammoth Switzerland in human form.
Now that the time has come for a bit of self-assertion, the traditions of
more than 40 years forbid it. Geopolitical ambition degenerated into farce
in a constitutional court case which was supposed to resolve the question,
'should Germans fly over Bosnia?'
Always a tricky question, and the future of the government could hang on it.
But this kind of strife is a bit odd in a country which would like to be a
permanent member of the Security Council where macho self-assurance used to
be a necessary if not sufficient condition of membership.
So it was that the FAZ had another good ruminate about German power. It
quoted the British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd enviously: 'British
foreign policy has the task of protecting and promoting British interests.
In spite of the changes in the world nothing has changed this basic truth.
The question of what are British interests must be answered anew by each
generation.'
The FAZ noted that this was a classic 'national-state declaration' and
added: 'It is hard to imagine such a policy statement coming from the mouth
of a German Chancellor.'
I tested this view on a number of Germans, handing them the German text and
putting deutsche in place of britische. The consensus was that the statement
had been either a sober assessment of reality on the part of Bismarck or a
drunk one from the lips of the present foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel. All
agreed that no German politician could speak of the country's national
interests without the addition of some rambling Euro-rhetoric, but that
Germany was gradually moving towards a position where a Bismarckian
statement could be made, and never mind foreign wincing.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine added its bit of Euro-rhetoric, emphasising that
Germany's prosperity depended on the Community's markets. But what Germany
suffers is by no means unique. In spite of the bold clarity of Douglas
Hurd's statement of principle, there is no clear view in any large country
about the definition of its 'national interest.'
In the old days, if it was only natural for Germany to attack Serbs, it was
also right for the French to help the Serbs. The British would check to see
whose victory appeared the less desirable and come down on the other side.
The US would see profitable opportunities in keeping out of trouble while
the Russians reckoned on consolidating their hold on anything they could
grab. Those old certainties may have been flawed, leading to world wars and
suchlike, but at least we knew where we were. Today's generation, in Britain
especially, would be no better off than the Germans in agreeing on a clarion
call to mobilise the nation. I propose, 'Half a treaty is better than a
strong pound.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Computing For Investors: The playful way to do your accounts
 -Jean Miles tries finance programs and learns to love mice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I CAN summon the necessary stoutness of heart to deal with a flesh-and-blood
mouse, but I have not had the same success with the ones attached to
computers.
Mice are an almost invariable accompaniment of the Windows operating system.
Windows is a program to be run before you run any other program. It needs a
lot of computer memory and a lot of disk space. It has little pictures,
called icons, for you to click at with your mouse. With Windows, you can run
several programs at the same time.
Windows does seem to be the signpost to the future. I swallowed my
scepticism and looked at three finance programs for Windows: Microsoft
Money, a Windows program tout court; Quicken for Windows, brother of a DOS
program; and Sage Moneywise, which comes with the DOS and the Windows
versions in the same box so you do not have to decide until you get home.
I have written about Quicken (for DOS) before as a home budget program. But
I use the phrase 'finance program' this time because Money and Quicken are
also something else, new in Britain: serious accounting programs for people
who think they do not understand accounting. Moneywise, on the other hand,
is unashamedly a computerised cashbook, part of the traditional double-entry
book-keeping system. Money and Quicken are US imports, carefully converted;
Moneywise is a British program.
The basic structure of all such programs is the same. You define the
accounts in which your money resides. As sums arrive and depart, you assign
each transaction to one or more income or expense categories: salary,
interest earnt, electricity, mortgage, whatever. Quicken and Money allow
subcategories, which can be included or 'hidden' in your financial reports.
If you are registered for VAT, each of your categories can have a VAT code
and transactions will then automatically, in all three programs, be broken
into Net and VAT amounts. Quicken and Money can suppress this feature.
Moneywise enforces VAT tracking until you figure out how to turn it off.
In Money and Quicken it is possible to assign a transaction to a class or a
subclass as well as to a category or subcategory. The mind begins to boggle,
although it is straightforward in practice. All US budget programs assume
(interestingly) that you are likely to own or manage rental property:
assigning transactions to classes lets you view both income and expenditure
property-by-property. The system also has its uses if you want to break
things down by client, by job, or by project.
Quicken and Money both let you fiddle with categories, subcategories,
classes and subclasses, after you have started using the program, changing
the names, merging categories, reassigning transactions.
Moneywise enforces proper standards of accountancy. No change can be made
once a transaction has been 'posted'. I had to install the program from
scratch several times because it refused to allow me to redeem the mistakes
made in setting up my accounts.
It is the freedom to shape the program to your purposes which is the novel
element in Quicken and Money. Gone are the formal constraints and the
terminology of accounting. But programs can still handle accounts receivable
and accounts payable. Aged debtors (I love that phrase) can be identified.
Quicken is the better at predicting cash-flow.
Half the point, and more than half the fun, of Windows programs are the
graphics. Moneywise is restrained, offering only bar or line graphs
comparing actual, budgeted, and last year's expenditure. Both Money and
Quicken offer a rich variety of line, bar, stacked bar, and pie charts.
In Money, you call up charts as a visual representation of a financial
report, once you have tweaked the report to your liking. All those
categories and classes provide a lot of scope for designing and filtering
reports. Quicken does things the other way around: you specify a chart, then
click on a particular section of it to see the underlying figures.
By this stage I was having a lot of fun with my mouse. Best of all was
Quicken's iconbar, a row of coloured pictures across the top of the screen,
providing quick access to various aspects of the program. You can choose
icons yourself and assign them to actions you use frequently. I found an
icon of a cash dispenser and set it up to open my cash account. This may cut
as much as a second from the time otherwise taken in choosing that account,
but that is not the point.
What did I conclude? Moneywise did not seem a good choice for private
accounts. It is a program for small business cash accounting. There were
features I liked, including the feeling of rugged reliability. A club
treasurer bowed down by a sense of responsibility for other people's money
might welcome the constraints this program imposes.
Quicken and Money are both very usable, similar in concept, and as suitable
for private accounts as for small businesses and the self-employed. I prefer
Quicken. Both have good manuals, but Quicken's is fuller. Money will not
print your cheques or monitor your portfolio; Quicken will. VAT tracking is
more sophisticated in Quicken. it will calculate VAT on transfers between
accounts. And in Quicken you can customise the iconbar.
All three programs require an IBM-compatible computer running DOS 3.1 or a
later version and Microsoft Windows. The prices below include VAT.
Microsoft Money costs Pounds 59.95 from Microsoft, Microsoft Place,
Winnersh, Wokingham, Berkshire RG11 5TP. 0734-270000.
Sage Moneywise costs Pounds 49 from Sage House, Benton Pk Rd, Newcastle upon
Tyne NE7 7LZ. 091-201-3000. Fax 091-201-0308.
Quicken for Windows costs Pounds 59.95 from Intuit UK, Manor Court, High St,

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tokyo breathes again - But will the
market revival continue?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOKYO stock market, which seemed only last year to have nowhere to go
but down, has revived. The Nikkei 225, which in August reached a low for the
decade of 14,929, peaked briefly above 20,000 this week.
For non-Japanese investors, the strength of the yen has given an extra boost
to returns. The Japanese market was up 18.6 per cent in dollar terms in the
first quarter of 1993, making it the best-performing major market bar South
Africa. Over the year to April 6, the rise in dollar terms was 42.3 per
cent.
For UK investors, the effect of September's devaluation, makes the rebound
even more dramatic. Since the Nikkei's low in August, the index is up around
89 per cent in sterling terms.
The average Japanese unit trust rose 38.2 per cent (offer to offer with
income re-invested) over the six months to April 1, according to Finstat.
But the market continues to trade at only half its level at the start of
January 1990. So, private investors should be asking: is the rally set to
continue, or have those who buy now missed the boat?
Ian Burden, who manages the James Capel Japan Growth fund - second in the
sector over 10 years, with a rise of 483.9 per cent - says the rebound
'feels completely different from any of the bear market rallies we have had
over the past few years. The authorities are moving to a much more
pro-active and aggressive policy stance.'
He points to the speed with which the 1993 Budget was passed. 'The Japanese
economy is in severe recession, but fiscal policy is being used quite
aggressively and there has been a gradual improvement in liquidity.'
Burden adds: 'The stock market will be an initial beneficiary of any
short-term growth in liquidity, just as in the US when interest rates fell
sharply and investors moved out of cash and into equities. There has been
encouraging anecdotal evidence that the domestic individual is coming back
into the market.'
That move could be echoed by foreign institutions, Burden feels. 'Since
Japan has been something of a one-way bet for the past three years, many US
and European investors have been underweight in the area.'
Burden warns, however: 'The news on the economy and earnings is still poor
and I am not expecting any really good news on earnings until the period
September 1993-March 1994. What the market is doing now is anticipating that
1994 recovery.'
John Wright manages the Stewart Ivory Japan fund which, Finstat shows, is
top of the sector over 10 years with a return of almost 500 per cent
(offer-to-bid with net income re-invested).
'The general expectation was that the Japanese government would help the
market ahead of the March year-end when banks have to value their equity
holdings,' he says. 'Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the market are not
that lousy. The country can take stimulative measures without putting the
Budget into deep deficit, and inflation is very low.'
One factor that always puzzles the overseas investor is that Japanese shares
tend to trade on very high price-earnings ratios. In the mid-1980s, Japan
bulls argued that these were irrelevant to Japan, where accounting standards
are different.
The cynical saw that as the kind of argument that can be self-deluding, and
the 1990 decline as a come-uppance for those who choose to ignore
fundamentals.
Early in the 1990s, the problem has not been that share prices are high but
that earnings have fallen dramatically. According to Datastream, the p/e
ratio on the Japanese market is 49 now. If UK shares ever reached that
rating, most sane investors would be heading for the exits.
Wright says Japanese companies are often 'not run for bottom line earnings
per share, but for market share and volume.' He points out, though, that
there are important valuation measures other than the p/e ratio: 'Japan is
cheaper than the UK and the US on a price to cashflow basis.'
A further important factor is that the very low interest rates of the 1980s
encouraged Japanese companies to splurge on capital spending. This hits
earnings by increasing the depreciation charge. But capital spending now is
dropping sharply. This will reduce the depreciation charge and allow
earnings to recover. P/e ratios may start to fall.
So, will the market move ahead once more? Wright fears there could be a
correction once the Nikkei 225 moves into the early 20,000s. He thinks a
more major move could depend on confirmation that corporate earnings are
improving; like Burden, he believes this might not happen until late this
year.
Ken Inglis, group investment director at Allied Dunbar, says: 'It is
reasonable to assume there has been some sort of sea change in attitude
towards Japan. The market has reached the end of a long dark tunnel, and it
is encouraging for western investors to see that the banks are not leading
this rally.' He feels that, though the rise will not be continuous; the
market has further to climb.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Joanna romps in as top adviser - A
fee-based IFA has won a top contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTING to assess financial advisers is not easy. They specialise in
different areas and have to deal with people whose personal finances often
differ radically. But a reliable system for judging the quality of advice is
central to any reform of the UK's financial services.
The IFA of the Year competition, run by the magazine Money Week, has made
such an attempt. Advisers were given detailed case studies of households and
required to produce a 2,000-word report recommending how best to manage
their personal finances.
The winner was Joanna Stone, who works for the fee-charging adviser Murray
Noble. The case study she was set, and her response, showed just how complex
personal financial planning can become.
Her case was that of Mr and Mrs Robertson, aged 41 and 40, with children of
16 and 13. The couple's annual incomes were Pounds 30,000 (including Pounds
7,000 in bonuses) for him and Pounds 20,000 for her (including Pounds 3,000
in bonuses). Both belonged to the company pension scheme, and the family
carried private medical insurance.
Most of the income was spent right away, due to mortgage payments of Pounds
1,050 a month and school fees of Pounds 7,000 a year. But the Robertsons did
have assets, including a French cottage and a share portfolio valued at
around Pounds 10,000.
They had asked for advice simply to assess their position. They believed
their budget to be very restricted, with no more than Pounds 100 a month to
spare.
While nothing much rings alarms bells there, Stone found several areas where
she felt the Robertsons needed to alter their finances radically.
She said the big problems were the school fees and the mortgage, which was
not protected by life cover, and she set out a plan to re-arrange the
family's cash flow.
In descending order of importance, the key aspects were:
Agree a new budget and
finance structure
Stone spotted that the Robertsons had an outstanding balance of around
Pounds 10,000 on various credit and store cards. This is a ruinously
expensive form of debt, and she pointed out that it was worth selling the
equities to repay the card bills. (An equity portfolio would have to be
chosen exceptionally well to manage a growth rate greater than a credit card
interest rate). She also suggested that they should rent their property in
France for Pounds 4,000 a year.
These two acts increased greatly the income available for spending each
month. She also recommended forming a profit-related pay scheme into which
the bonuses could be paid tax-free, and taking out a fixed-rate mortgage.
All of this would allow the Robertsons a sizeable cash reserve.
Arrange for further
life cover
Stone looked at what the company pension scheme guaranteed and found Mrs
Robertson's annual income would increase by only Pounds 8,000 after her
husband's death while her debts would increase by Pounds 6,389. So, she
suggested the family take out a protection policy to cover its Pounds
160,000 mortgage (at a cost of around Pounds 50 a month), plus term cover of
Pounds 120,000 for Mr Robertson to last until age-65 (costing about Pounds
54). She also suggested Mrs Robertson take out term cover (at Pounds 24 a
month) to cover her until age-60.
Replacement income
Stone worked out that if both could not work because of temporary or
permanent illness, their disposable income after 12 months (when their
employer's sick pay arrangements ran out) would be Pounds 5,777 a year. So,
she proposed that both take out permanent health insurance which would start
paying them an income once they had been unable to work for 12 months. (This
time lag kept premiums much lower than if the income payments began
earlier). Total annual premiums would be Pounds 500 (Pounds 700 if they
wanted inflation protection).
Once this groundwork was in place, Stone suggested the couple build up a
cash reserve and then invest in a regular savings scheme (probably the
National Savings Yearly Plan), making occasional contributions to a larger
portfolio when finances allowed.
What made Stone's work stand out? According to Keith Popplewell, who set the
case studies: 'The poorer candidates concentrated too much on the clients'
need for death benefit. This 'need' may not exist in practice beyond cover
for the mortgage and credit card balance . . . Surely an equal or even
greater need is for permanent health insurance, a possibility left
relatively unexplored by some entrants.'
His final comment was telling: 'To suggest, as many candidates did, that the
expenditure saved could be invested in monthly savings or pension plans was,
in my opinion, misguided. The immediate need for these clients was
protection.'
Stone's employer, Murray Noble, charges fees but not commission. Thus, it
has no incentive to force clients straight into a high commission-bearing
savings plan based on life assurance.
Amanda Richards, editor of Money Week, said the remuneration side was very
attractive, adding that the magazine had received many strong entries from
commission-charging advisers. But the award must cast doubt on the
complaint, made often by advisers, that customers will not pay a fee. Murray
Noble seems to charge them without difficulty, and the evidence of this
competition is that customers get good value for money.

FT  10 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Your Peps are safe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I are now living permanently in the Netherlands, having left the
UK in April 1991, but are still treated as being resident in UK for tax
purposes. However, this residential assessment is due to be reconsidered in
April 1993 when we expect to be treated as no longer resident.
Both of us have several Peps taken out over a number of years. What will be
the position when our situation changes and we are no longer required to pay
tax in the UK? Will these investments in Peps be allowed to continue or must
they be liquidated?
All that happens (under regulation 8 of the Personal Equity Plan Regulations
1989) when a Pep investor ceases to be both resident and ordinarily resident
in the UK is that he or she is not entitled to put any more cash into any
Peps. The regulation says that the investor 'may retain the benefits of the
plan (including the right to any relief or exemption due under the plan)
subsisting at that time.' Ask your UK tax office for the free pamphlet
IR89(1992) (Personal equity plans).

FT  10 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A matter of forms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE JUST received a dividend from Euro Disney sent by the National
Westminster bank. They say the form claiming a French tax refund should be
completed in quadruplicate. Does this mean I should send four forms to the
NatWest and one to the inspector of taxes in this country? Also, in claiming
back the French withholding tax, it seems I shall lose a percentage of it.
How much will actually be sent to me and my wife? Finally, do I claim the
full amount that is on the dividend slip, as the shares are held jointly
with my wife? She is a 25 per cent taxpayer and I am a non-taxpayer.
Send all the completed copies of the form RF4-GB to your tax office. The
inspector will complete his part, keep one copy for his file and send the
others back to you; you should then send them back to the bank. You will be
paid the 50 per cent avoir fiscal (tax credit) plus 2.5 per cent out of the
25 per cent withholding tax; so, ultimately, you will bear 22.5 per cent
French withholding tax - which is equivalent to 15 per cent of the
dividend-plus-avoir fiscal. As a basic-rate taxpayer, your wife ultimately
will bear UK tax at 10 per cent on the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal, so she
will end up with 75 per cent of the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal (subject to
the variation in the exchange rate between the time the dividend was
converted to sterling and the time when the payment from the French
government arrives).
A joint claim by your wife and yourself will probably be acceptable to the
French tax authorities. If your wife's tax affairs are dealt with at a
different tax office from yours, however, it might may be simpler to ask the
bank for another form so that each of you can submit a claim in respect of
your half share of the dividend.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income lure in new bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARANTEED equity bonds have offered little so far to investors who want
income. Now Acuma, the financial planning arm of American Express, has
devised a new product to meet that gap - the Fixed High Income bond.
The key to this offer is that Acuma has chopped up the income and capital
elements in a new way. After five years, basic-rate taxpayers are assured of
a minimum capital return which, in addition to the income received, gives
them back their original investment. That is the same guarantee as on a
conventional GEB - the return is just offered in a different way.
Getting only your money back after five years is not much of a deal - the
capital will have declined in value in real terms and you will have missed
the interest you could have earned in the building society.
What is needed to make the bond worthwhile is a rise in the stock market:
the capital repayment level is linked to the FT-SE 100 index.
But investors need to know what they are doing when they buy this bond.
Three levels of income are offered - 10, 9 and 7.5 per cent (these are paid
net of basic rate tax; higher rate taxpayers may face an extra charge).
The higher the level of income you choose, the more the FT-SE 100 will have
to grow to repay your capital in full, as well as earning the income.
An example might help. If you invest Pounds 10,000 (the minimum is Pounds
5,000) and opt for 10 per cent income, you will get Pounds 1,000 a year in
income for five years, or Pounds 5,000 in all.
If the FT-SE 100 does not rise at all over the next five years, or falls,
you will receive Pounds 5,000 of capital back in 1998 to take you back to
your original Pounds 10,000.
The FT-SE 100 would need to rise 10 per cent a year in order for you to get
back all your capital plus the income on top (so your overall gain would be
50 per cent).
If you opt for the 9 per cent income, return of capital depends on 8 per
cent growth in the Footsie; at 7.5 per cent income, the Footsie needs to
rise at only 4 per cent a year.
These are not overly demanding rates of return - in the five years to end
December 1992, the index rose by 10.7 per cent a year. But you would not get
more than your original capital returned. And, as with other GEBs, you do
not benefit from the yield on the Footsie.
All this makes it a difficult product to assess. It is an odd hybrid of
equities and cash. Even a 7.5 per cent income is highly attractive at
present interest rates, and it would be reasonable to expect the 4 per cent
annual rise in the Footsie needed to get your money back.
But if the market climbs substantially, you would do better to buy most
conventional GEBs - and even better to buy an indexed unit trust, such as
Gartmore's. And if the market falls, you will be better off in the building
society.
The lure of the income offered could attract many investors to Acuma, but
they should be aware of the risks.

<TEXT>
TINSLEY Robor, the printing and packaging company, has had a difficult
period over the past couple of years, with its share price falling from
around 20p to barely 5p. But four members of the board, including a
non-executive director, have bought stock at 6p.
Shares at Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, have recovered steadily
since the middle of 1992. Following the announcement of interim results,
chairman Peter Lloyd and Richard Corfield, an executive director, sold
500,000 and 300,000 respectively at 280p. Lloyd still retains 3m shares
while Corfield has reduced his holding by a quarter.
Bemrose Corporation has announced it will complete the acquisition of
Bemrose Yattendon, a US joint venture, through a 1-for-2 rights issue at
265p. Robert Iliffe, the principal shareholder in Yattendon and a
non-executive director of Bemrose, sold his entire holding in Bemrose at
301p in anticipation of the deal and prior to his intended resignation from
the board at an EGM on April 15.
Crestacare, in the health and household sector, is involved with providing
sheltered accommodation for the elderly. Andrew Taee was appointed recently
as chief executive, and he and a non-executive director bought more than
1.78m shares at prices around 32p.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES; cause for anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUST is still settling on the most tempestuous year for the business
expansion scheme. Now, it starts its last nine months before being abolished
at the end of 1993.
Total investment in BES companies more than doubled, to Pounds 957m, in the
1992-93 tax year compared with Pounds 367m in 1991-92, according to figures
from the Allenbridge group.
In many cases, last year's investors will have received excellent deals. But
they have cause now to be anxious that the sponsors who put these together
did not take any short cuts with the paperwork involved.
The Inland Revenue gives every impression of having lost patience. This
might be because the BES has lost touch with the high-risk start-up
companies it was supposed to help.
Allenbridge's figures show that only Pounds 7m went to trading companies
last year, the worst level since the BES began. But assured tenancies took
Pounds 950m, of which Pounds 880m went to schemes with contracted exits.
In three separate cases, tax inspectors have laid down a strict
interpretation of BES rules and are threatening to deny relief. These cases
are:
Johnson Fry's schemes, launched just before last year's general election,
which bought accommodation for University College, London. The schemes had
not received provisional approval and the Revenue believes regulations may
have been broken because the accommodation was let to conferences during the
summer vacation.
Loan-back schemes launched before the Budget by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and
the National Westminster bank. Each scheme took Pounds 25m and allotted
shares before the deadline, but the Revenue is not convinced the shares were
issued correctly to shareholders in time.
Country Gardens, a series of trading companies which raised Pounds 15m under
the BES in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Investors have been asked by the Revenue to
return their tax relief with interest. Inspectors decided the companies were
in technical breach of regulations by operating a non-qualifying subsidiary
and holding too much money in cash.
These episodes suggest that investors should avoid sponsors which lack
experience, or schemes that stretch the rules. But what are the prospects
for supply over the rest of the year?
The abolition of non-recourse loans has not damaged the economics for
building societies of using the BES for repossessions - it remains cheap
finance for them. But the lack of a quick exit route means societies would
have to be prepared to raise money over several months, which makes the BES
less attractive.
The Halifax is now unlikely to use the scheme. It points out that raising
funds this way is too complex, although it is still considering the BES as
an option. But the Building Society Association disagrees, and there will be
plenty of repossessed housing available to BES companies for the rest of the
year.
Investors have another problem. The issues are confused this year because
the BES season will end with the calendar year, not the tax year. An
imminent deadline could allow intermediaries to hurry investors into making
decisions, but it would be wise to resist the pressure. If you do not know
how much top-rate tax you would need to pay for the 1993-94 tax year, you
should err on the side of caution.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Throgmorton's painful fightback -
Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROGMORTON is an example of an investment trust that lost its way in the
1980s. According to Micropal, it has been one of the 20 worst performers
over the past five years, with a fall of 14 per cent (mid-market to
mid-market with net income re-invested). Admittedly, Throgmorton specialises
in a sector - smaller companies - which has been battered by recession. But
consistently its long-term performance is below the sector average: 11th out
of 16 over 10 years, 14th of 18 over five, and 15th of 19 over three.
The big problem has been ventures into outside areas, especially property.
The chairman, Lord Stewartby, says: 'The strategy is to get the trust back
to basics. During the second half of the 1980s, it increased debt in order
to acquire extraneous interests. A lot of activity is devoted to disengaging
from those areas.'
This policy has taken longer than expected to implement. A joint venture
with Cussins Property took a year to unravel and required Throgmorton to
accept property assets in settlement of debts. Some of that property was
sold in 1992, and the trust hopes to dispose of more in 1993.
On the house-building side, disposals have taken time because, as Stewartby
explains: 'You can't sell half-developed sites.' Even unwinding an
investment in art dealer Arthur Ackerman has left Throgmorton with Pounds 1m
worth of residual stock in pictures.
The stake in fund management group Framlington has been cut gradually to 49
per cent via the sale of two tranches of stock to French bank Credit
Commercial de France. The remaining holding was valued on November 30 at
Pounds 27.9m.
The best news for the trust, however, is that there are signs of a revival
in both smaller company shares and its own relative performance. Over the
year to April 1, the trust's investors enjoyed a gain of 32.7 per cent,
placing it sixth out of 24 funds in the sector.
It takes time for a trust to recover from a problem period, though,
particularly as the dividend was nearly halved at the end of 1990. Although
some smaller company specialists trade at a premium to net assets,
Throgmorton shares trade at a 21 per cent discount.
Throgmorton was founded in 1957 and named after its headquarters in
Throgmorton Street, close to the Bank of England. It has always specialised
in smaller companies and has a sister trust, Throgmorton 1000, which looks
at companies even smaller than the main trust will consider.
Its present manager is Sally Hepher, a 30-year-old Oxford graduate who
managed funds at Barings before joining Framlington in 1990. She stresses
that management is a team effort, and has seven others to help her.
The trust defines smaller companies as those with market capitalisations of
under Pounds 200m. Hepher says she is looking for good-quality companies
which can produce above-average growth in turnover - organically as well as
by acquisitions - in profits, earnings, retained earnings and dividends.
She says she is optimistic about the prospects for smaller company shares,
as they are relatively more exposed to the UK domestic economy which, she
feels, is improving. 'The companies we invest in have done a great deal to
control costs,' says Hepher, which leaves them well placed to gain from the
economic recovery.
The 10 largest stocks are Framlington, Davis Service, Throgmorton 1000
Smaller Companies, Watson &amp; Philip, Senior Engineering, John Waddington,
More O'Ferrall, Trinity International, Frost Group and Suter.
Some legacies of the past remain for Hepher to overcome. One storm cloud
hanging over the trust has been Pounds 58m of convertible stock issued in
1988 and 1989. Conversion into shares will be profitable once the share
price gets above 108p; unfortunately, with the shares trading now at around
58p, that prospect looks a long way off.
What makes it worse for Throgmorton is that the stockholders have a put
option, giving them the right on April 30 to redeem the convertible at 117.5
per cent of par. It became clear some time ago that many might well take up
that option. landing Throgmorton with a hefty bill.
The news is not all bad. Throgmorton has been accumulating reserves steadily
to try to meet the liability. Furthermore, some stockholders acquired the
convertible as part of the consideration for acquiring Framlington.
Realising the convertible for cash would land them with a hefty capital
gains tax bill.
To solve their problem, and help itself, Throgmorton has proposed issuing
new stock at 117.5 per cent of the previous par value but with the same
coupon. For those who do transfer, this means a 17.5 per cent increase in
income. Holders of Pounds 13.5m of stock have agreed already to accept the
new securities and Throgmorton hopes more will do so.
For the others, it has arranged a Pounds 30m bank loan to meet the
redemption cost. It plans to repay that by selling its remaining property
and unquoted interests.
Once the loan is out of the way, might a revived Throgmorton be an
interesting play on the small companies sector? After all, few trusts can be
bought on a 20 per cent-plus discount these days.
Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, thinks there is an optimistic case
for the trust. 'So many of the things that gave the trust a complex
structure are beginning to sort themselves out,' he says. The convertibles
will be replaced by cheap borrowings and warrants will be exercised.
Framlington's funds under management are rising and the property issue is
under control. What will be left, says Robertson, is one of the larger
trusts devoted to smaller companies.
Key facts
Net assets per share are around 74p. That puts the shares, at 58p on April
6, on a discount of 21 per cent, according to NatWest Securities. The
dividend yield is 5 per cent and the annual management fee around 0.93 per
cent.
Board
The chairman, Lord Stewartby, was economic secretary to the Treasury from
1983 to 1987. Other executive directors are Peter Courtney (finance); Paul
Loach (managing director of Framlington) and Brian Rout (managing director
of the property subsidiary). Non-executives are Sir Victor Garland, a
director of the Prudential; Richard Good, also chairman of Throgmorton Dual;
Michael Orr, chairman of Molins; and Michael Windsor, executive chairman of
Horstmann Group.
Savings scheme and Pep details
The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds
250 for a lump sum. There are no dealing charges. The trust qualifies for
full Pep status but no specific plan is linked to it.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Prolific offers Pep bonus - News in
Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROLIFIC is offering a 1.25 per cent bonus on lump sum investments made into
its unit trust personal equity plans. The offer applies to plans taken out
between April 6 and June 1. Switching costs between unit trusts within the
Pep have also been lowered, with a full discount of the manager's initial
charge available.
Save &amp; Prosper is waiving its initial plan charge on its all-share Peps, the
Managed Portfolio and Dealing plans, for those who invest more than Pounds
4,000 before the end of May. It is also offering a 2 per cent discount on
its unit trust Pep (the effect is to cut the initial charge from 5.5 to 3.5
per cent) on the same terms.

NATIONAL &amp; Provincial building society is offering a range of fixed-rate
mortgages over periods from one to five years. Rates vary from 5.95 per cent
(8.2 per cent APR) for two years (on loans no greater than 60 per cent of a
house's value) to 8.5 per cent (9 per cent APR) for five years on loans of
up to 95 per cent of valuation. Arrangement fees are Pounds 200 or Pounds
250, depending on term; redemption penalties are 90 days' interest (for
loans over one to three years) or 120 days' interest (for loans over four
and five years). Building and contents insurance must be arranged through
N&amp;P. The rates are available on all types of mortgages.
Midland Bank is offering rates linked to endowment and pension mortgages
only. The two-year rate is 6.99 per cent (APR 8.2 per cent) on an
arrangement fee of Pounds 195. The five-year rate is 7.95 per cent (8.4 per
cent) for a fee of Pounds 250. The redemption penalty is six months'
interest, or three months if there are fewer than two years left before the
end of the loan.

THE INSTITUTE of Financial Planning, which promotes professional, fee-based
financial advice, has launched its first financial planning examination.
Successful applicants can use the exam as the final step towards gaining
associate membership of the IFP (becoming an AIFP).
In future, consumers will know that anyone with these letters after their
name has passed two three-hour 'open book' written examinations, working on
case studies of fictitious people and business situations.
The range of the syllabus is broad, including banking, cash investments,
credit and mortgages, tax planning, pensions, annuities, trusts, and types
of investment for both lump sums and regular savings, including investment
planning. Candidates will also need to be able to write reports and use
financial calculators.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Societies battle First Option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies are trying to fight back against the competitive threat
offered by the First Option bond from National Savings, which is offering
6.34 per cent gross (4.75 per cent net) to those who invest Pounds 1,000 for
a minimum period of a year.
That return is beaten by the Portman society, which is paying 6.5 per cent
gross (4.875 per cent net) for investments of more than Pounds 500. The rate
is guaranteed for a year.
Meanwhile, the Better Option bond from Bristol &amp; West, available from April
13, will guarantee 6.75 per cent gross (5.06 per cent net) for a year on
deposits of more than Pounds 5,000.
On amounts over Pounds 25,000, the bond will pay 7 per cent gross (5.06 per
cent net); the First Option will pay 6.74 per cent gross on investments of
more than Pounds 20,000.
Some societies have warned that if First Option draws away their deposits,
they will have to raise savings rates to compete. If that happened, mortgage
rates would have to increase as well.
But Ken Culley, Portman's chief executive, said: 'Both my own society, and
others, are demonstrating that we are able to continue to offer attractive
rates of return to savers, and talk of rising mortgage rates at this stage
is premature.'
A different fixed-rate option is available from Bristol &amp; West.
Its escalator bond, available to those with Pounds 5,000, pays a rate of
interest which is guaranteed to increase every year for five years.
In the first year, the annual rate is 7 per cent gross (monthly 6.79 per
cent); the second year 7.5 per cent (7.25 per cent monthly); the third year
8 per cent (7.72 per cent); the fourth year 8.5 per cent (8.19 per cent);
and the fifth year 9 per cent (8.65 per cent). There is no early access,
except in the case of the investor's death.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is closing its Best 90 account to new investors from
April 17. The account guarantees to pay the highest 90-day rate of any top
10 building society (plus Abbey National) on amounts of Pounds 10,000,
Pounds 25,000, Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000.
The guarantee extends until May 1994.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Irish Life strikes a blow for industry
reform - The company will now not offer combined savings and life insurance
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH LIFE made a small but significant breakthrough for reform of the life
insurance industry this week.
From now on it will not offer combined savings and life insurance products.
Customers can buy both at the same time if they wish and combine them with
one payment for extra convenience, but the costs of the two will be itemised
and kept separate.
This makes good sense. Savings and life assurance are different needs and it
is unlikely that many people will need to do both at once. If you only need
to take out insurance for your family in case you die, there seems little
point in saving any extra.
The approach does not sound revolutionary, because it keeps up the standard
industry practice of using an irritating brand name. But behind the 'Total
Quality Lifestyle' range of life and savings products lies some potential
good value.
How could the approach save you money? Irish Life provide the following
example for a 30-year-old man who wants to cover his life for Pounds 250,000
for the next 20 years.
Under a standard flexible whole of life policy, which includes an investment
element, Irish Life says this would cost Pounds 307.65 per month for 20
years (assuming the fund grows at 7.5 per cent, and that the cover is
indexed at 5 per cent annually).
Using standard Lautro illustrative growth rates, this would produce a fund
value of Pounds 154,000 on growth of 7 per cent, and of Pounds 315,000 on
growth of 10.5 per cent.
This sounds like an adequate deal. However, under the new TQL system, Irish
Life would ask for life assurance premiums of only Pounds 54.95 per month,
to cover for 20 years. If our 30-year-old also wanted to save then he could,
if he wanted, put Pounds 252.70 towards the TQL Savings contribution and
still pay the same as he would have done in total premiums under his
flexible whole-of-life contract.
Using the same Lautro assumptions, this would grow to Pounds 179,000 on
growth of 7 per cent - 16 per cent more than the Pounds 154,000 from the
whole-of-life policy. On a growth rate of 10.5 per cent the gain is even
more pronounced - Pounds 379,000, an advantage of 20 per cent.
Unbundling life assurance is not easy, and Irish Life's new 'Total Quality
Lifestyle Account' includes three forms of assurance, two forms of term
insurance and two savings plans. Contributions in each area are analysed and
priced separately. However, the convenience of keeping the disparate
elements under one heading, often touted by life insurance salesmen, is
maintained by allowing all three elements to be administered under one
account number using one direct debit and one administration fee.
According to Tony Dallison, marketing manager: 'One of the common complaints
from clients is that the product they purchase cannot change with their
circumstances, or that if it can, there is a heavy penalty charge. This is
no longer the case.'
Irish Life should not be judged on its new improved structure alone.
Ultimately, its products must stand on the cheapness of the protection
premiums and the strength of its investment performance. It is likely that
you will be able to get better value by shopping around. But the move does
make life assurance easier to understand, and makes it harder for less
scrupulous sales agents to sell people products which they do not need.
It is also timely, as the Office of Fair Trading recommended last month that
insurance companies should be forced to reveal what proportions of life
premiums went towards investment and assurance.
The life assurance industry has not yet made a detailed response to the
proposals beyond claiming that the OFT's figures would be difficult to
calculate. This is particularly the case for with-profits contracts, where
investment profits are added via arcane annual bonus systems and do not
fluctuate with a unitised fund.
Life assurance is an integral, although minor, part of endowment policies,
which offer life assurance but also pay out at the end of a fixed period
even if you are still alive. The sum you would receive on death increases
during the life of the policy, in line with investment returns.
The exercise of separating life cover from the rest of the investment proved
difficult for all the large endowment providers contacted this week by the
Weekend FT, and different actuarial assumptions may have been used.
They were asked how much of the Pounds 30 monthly premium paid into an
endowment policy by a 29-year-old man would go towards life cover.
Commercial Union reckoned that Pounds 1.20 from each premium would be needed
to pay for the life cover. Standard Life reckoned on 80p for a 10-year
policy, and 95p for a 25-year policy. GA Life estimated the cost at 55p per
month.
The Prudential was unable to produce a figure, although the company
emphasised that it was quite prepared to disclose it - the problem was
making the complex actuarial calculations involved. Legal &amp; General refused
to disclose the information on grounds of business confidentiality.
The Office of Fair Trading provided an example of the disclosure it would
like to see from a good company, and estimated that life cover would cost
Pounds 18 each year out of total premiums of Pounds 600 - or Pounds 1.50
from Pounds 50 premiums.
A message common to all was that endowments should always be treated as
investments. That is why the OFT wants life offices to disclose the same
information for endowments as they do for unit trusts, which have no life
cover element.
In the meantime, Irish Life's exercise should make life assurance easier to
understand, while allowing customers to shop around. Will other companies
follow its lead?

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: EZTs shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Zone Trusts turned into the twilight zone last year. Only Pounds
43.2m was invested in them in 1992-93, compared with more than Pounds 160m
in 1991-92.
This may seem strange, as the tax relief on EZTs is generous - you are
entitled to relief at your top marginal rate of tax, without any upper
limit, on investments in enterprise zone property. Tax relief is available
on loans taken out to fund the property, and rental income is also tax-free.
However, commercial property is inflexible and presently ravaged by a slump
in prices. The tax rules governing EZs are tortuous. These factors have
forced down the demand for EZTs.
According to Ian Pugh, of the Allenbridge Group, unresolved issues also
dented confidence. Problems interpreting the rules for apportioning a value
for the land on which the property is built, on which tax relief is not
available, forced many trusts to wait as long as a year before the value of
their tax relief was known.
The Concept Regional Portfolio trust, sponsored by the solicitors Neill
Clerk, fell foul of an Inland Revenue attack on the rental income stream it
has arranged for investors to receive while the properties are being built.
Negotiations are continuing, but investors meanwhile soldier on without
their tax relief. Hardly surprising: the Revenue can only be expected to be
indignant about paying tax relief on an income derived from a building which
has yet to be built.
However, investors should not rule out EZTs altogether, particularly as the
BES is to be phased out at the end of the year. Some trusts had a solid
structure, offered good value, and sold out quickly this year even without
the benefit of publicity.
But investors must also have learnt that this is a dangerous market.
Opportunities exist, but nobody should try to take them without taking
professional advice.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: AVCs; a guide to investment
performance - Philip Coggan crunches the numbers on an annual survey of
pension arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACON &amp; WOODROW, the actuarial group, has published its annual survey of
additional voluntary contribution (AVC) pension arrangements.
The survey compares the actual returns offered by various contracts of the
with profits, unit-linked and building society varieties.
The results are designed to be useful to those in company pension schemes
who are paying into AVCs which operate on a money purchase basis - where the
final pension depends on the investment return.
The figures shown are for a person with a normal retirement date of January
1 1993 and use actual interest and bonus rates and expenses. Contributions
have been assumed at Pounds 600 per annum, payable monthly.
Returns for with profits contracts are shown both with and without the
terminal bonus, which can be highly volatile. (The aim of a with profits
policy is to smooth returns. Annual bonuses are added each year and cannot
be withdrawn; terminal bonuses, however, are more dependent on investment
conditions at maturity.)
As the tables show, if terminal bonuses are ignored, only a very few
insurance companies are able to match building society returns.
Reductions in bonuses mean that the returns on with profits contracts have
generally been lower than last year. Returns on unit-linked contracts have
increased, however, to reflect good investment performance.
However, Bacon &amp; Woodrow does not believe that its five year embargo on with
profits personal pensions, should also be used in this area. Members of
company pension schemes may well value the security on offer from the with
profits policy; investment return may be a less important factor.
Two further factors should be noted on with profits plans. Some companies
offer special terms (ignoring commissions) which can enhance the returns
shown in the table. On the other hand, some with profits contracts impose
early retirement penalties, resulting in less competitive returns if the
policy proceeds are taken before the retirement date specified in the
contract.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow adds: 'It is clear that insurance companies are continuing
to move away from conventional with profits contracts. Several have replaced
their conventional contract with a unitised with profits arrangement and an
increasing number of companies are also offering funds which are directly
linked to the underlying investments.'
Few unit-linked plans have been in existence for 10 years, so Bacon &amp;
Woodrow has not produced figures for that duration. However, it does have
unit-linked figures for seven years; over that period, they lag behind with
profits returns. The leading unit-linked fund outperforms only three of the
with profits funds over that period.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow cites the Prudential as the company with the best with
profits record which is still marketing an AVC policy in that form. Among
the unit-linked funds, Gartmore was the leading provider over three years
and National Mutual over five years. Among building societies, Northern Rock
and the Nationwide respectively led over five and ten years.
The actuarial group concludes: 'We advise trustees and employers to review
their AVC scheme regularly, looking not only at past performance but also at
the standards of service received, and the provider's financial position and
prospects.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Research - the key to success - Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson explains how he picks profitable shares . . . and some
that aren't - Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN at the boring cocktail party was disbelieving. 'Are you really Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson?' he asked, I felt like replying: 'No. I am really Zarg
from the planet Jupiter,' but I resisted the temptation.
A few minutes earlier, I had been accosted by a woman who said: 'Oh] You do
exist. I thought Kevin Goldstein-Jackson was all made up by journalists.'
Once people are convinced I am not a product of someone's imagination, they
tend to ask if the things I write about in Diary of a Private Investor are
all true. Can I give them some hot share tips and how do I find out about
companies before I invest in them?
The answers to all these questions are comparatively easy. My brief for this
column always has been to write about things that have happened (or are
happening) to myself or my family. If I say I have had a particular
investment experience, then it is true.
The good experiences (like buying shares in NMC for 12.5p and selling them
for 205p, or seeing certain shares double in price within a year) are just
as valid as the bad experiences (like buying 1,500 shares at 300p in Gresham
House Investment Trust for my personal pension scheme and seeing them fall
to 8p).
Under the Financial Services Act, I am unable to give people specific
investment advice other than in the pages of approved publications such as
the Financial Times. I cannot give people specific advice (like 'hot' share
tips), either in person or by letter.
Someone once said to me: 'I like to do what you seem to do. Walk around
watching what people are buying. Trying to spot the next trends. But if you
see a particular product that is selling well, how can you find out who made
it so you can buy shares in the company? Even if there is a manufacturer's
name on the product, that manufacturer might, in these days of
multi-national corporations, be owned by another company - so how do you
find the name of the ultimate owner?'
In such cases, I go first to my local reference library and look at Who Owns
Whom. This is a series of separate weighty volumes covering the UK, Europe,
North America, Australasia and the Far East. It lists many thousands of
subsidiaries, with details of their parent companies.
If Who Owns Whom cannot provide the answer, then I might ask British
Telecom's directory enquiries service to provide me with the number of the
company named on the product so I can ask it directly. If the product is
made overseas, then I try to find a friendly shop assistant who can tell me
the name of the UK distributor.
Sometimes, of course, the product is made by a private company and shares in
it cannot be bought. Or the product comes from a public-quoted company
which, for one reason or another, I would not touch with a barge pole.
I also subscribe to Campaign, the weekly magazine for people in the
advertising industry. It can be found in many public libraries and is very
useful for giving advance notice of new-product launches, with details of
the advertising agencies concerned and the makers.
In previous FT articles, I have described a number of the things for which I
look in a company before I invest. But to find many of those items (like
details of directors, profits records and debt levels), I use three
publications produced by Hemmington Scott Publishing of City Innovation
Centre, 26-31 Whiskin Street, London EC1R 0DT. The most useful is the Hambro
Company Guide, published every quarter; an annual subscription costs Pounds
99. It is also available, at a higher charge, on computer disc. The guide
gives profits' records and other information about each UK-quoted company.
The Arthur Andersen Corporate Register is published twice annually and costs
Pounds 150 a year. This gives much more detailed information about directors
 -very useful when I want to know the name of a company secretary to contact
in order to get the annual report. It includes each company's address.
The third Hemmington Scott publication is the Performance Rankings Guide,
also published twice annually, for Pounds 135 a year. This, as its name
implies, grades companies by a wide variety of criteria: from earnings per
share based on a five-year trend, to profit margins within certain sectors.
Many companies use the FT's Annual Reports service where, for the cost of a
phone call, a reader can get a free copy of any of the reports produced by
the participating companies. Details are given on the newspaper's share
price pages. I have found this service to be fast and efficient, and the
line is open 24 hours a day.
Another useful publication is the Estimate Directory, obtainable from
Edinburgh Financial Publishing, Freepost, Edinburgh EH3 0EN. This is
published monthly and an annual subscription costs Pounds 350. But you can
buy four issues - one sent each quarter - for just Pounds 120.
The directory is quite new. It started in March last year and collects a
wide variety of stockbrokers' estimates for the profits and earnings per
share of many quoted UK companies. It also contains details of major
shareholders, and a brief outline of the company's main activities.
In future, whenever I am depressed about poor performance from a share I
have selected, I will turn to the mid-February 1993 issue of the directory
and look at the entry for Queens Moat Houses. It tells how, earlier this
year, well-known brokers with highly-paid analysts were predicting profits
for the company of Pounds 85-90m.
I did not buy shares in Queens Moat. I had read the receivership sales
notices in the FT and noted there were a lot of hotels for sale at quite low
prices (including some well-known names). So, why did anyone think Queens
Moat would perform well when, clearly, conditions were tough?
Some people expect me to sit behind a flickering computer screen full of
information. I think that is the quickest way not to see the wood for the
trees - too much information can be just as damaging as too little. But, as
well as the reference books mentioned earlier, I also have a large number of
company reports plus a collection of press cuttings from the FT and other
publications - especially the weekly Investors Chronicle.
The cuttings all relate to particular companies in which I have money
already or am monitoring for possible future investment. I also keep copies
of the FT's share price pages for the last trading day in each year so that
I can look back on the annual share price highs and lows for each company.
As much as anything, I like to walk around in the real world, getting a
'feel' for a product, a company or a trend. Any private investor can do the
same: it does not require any special skill or super-intelligence. I am just
an ordinary person who wins sometimes and loses at others. So long as the
profits are more than the losses, I will continue doing it my way.

WITH the financial crisis at Queens Moat Houses still not fully explained,
the rest of the hotel sector is being closely watched. Forte reports full
year results next Thursday, with the City expecting pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 73m last time.
Some expect the group to cut its 9.91p a share dividend. If it does,
criticism is likely to be muted, with many regarding a cut as evidence of
financial sobriety. The group is likely to be pressed on whether it would be
interesed in any of Queens Moat's Continental properties, should these
become available.
Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group will bring more news on Thursday about
the building materials sector. The former, with about half the UK cement
market, is expected to report pre-tax profits for 1992 of about Pounds 85m,
down sharply from Pounds 124.2m a year earlier. There is some question
hanging over its 10.9p a share dividend.
RMC, benefitting from its extensive German operations, is likely to report
profits down only slightly from 1991's Pounds 167.4m.
Laura Ashley, the international fashion and furnishings group, is set to
report a return to the black on Thursday after three years of losses. It may
also pay a final dividend.
A revitalised performance in the UK and continued growth on the continent
should enable the group to report a Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m pre-tax profit for
the year to January.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lynch's golden rules for investors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOLLOWING is a selection from Peter Lynch's golden rules for investors.
Your investor's edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It
is something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use
your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.
Owning stocks is like having children - don't get involved with more than
you can handle. The part-time stockpicker probably has time to follow eight
to 12 companies, and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There do
not have to be more than five companies in the portfolio at any one time.
If you cannot find any companies that you think are attractive, put your
money in the bank until you discover some.
Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest
losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets.
Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in cold, non-growth
industries are consistent big winners.
A stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If
you are prepared, it cannot hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to
pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in
panic.
Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the
stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought
to avoid stocks and stock funds altogether.
Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy or
the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what is
actually happening to the companies in which you have invested.
If you study 10 companies, you will find one for which the story is better
than expected. If you study 50, you will find five. There are always
pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market.
If you do not study any companies, you have the same chance of success at
buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your
cards.
Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can
afford to be patient.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wise words from a stock-picking guru -
Philip Coggan reviews the investment wisdom of ex-Magellan boss Peter Lynch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER LYNCH might not be a name that is familiar to private investors in the
UK. But in the US, he is a stock market legend because of his success in
running Fidelity's Magellan fund.
When he started to manage the fund in 1977 it had Dollars 18m in assets. By
the time he retired in 1990 it was worth Dollars 14bn. Much of the increase
came from money raised from new investors; nevertheless Dollars 1,000
invested in the fund in 1977 was worth Dollars 28,000 by 1990.
The benefit of Lynch's wisdom is now available in a new book* which will
give a lot of encouragement to private investors. He sincerely believes that
private investors can beat the market by doing the right kind of research.
A bright and breezy writing style makes the book an easy read for anyone
with an interest in stock market investment. Scattered through the pages are
Lynch's one-liners, or Peter's principles, such as 'Never invest in any idea
you can't illustrate with a crayon', or 'All else being equal, invest in the
company with the fewest colour photographs in the annual report.'
But it would be wrong to suggest that the book is a succession of homilies.
There are plenty of practical examples of how Lynch goes about selecting
individual stocks. Some of the lessons are peculiar to the US - for example,
his enthusiasm for shares in the frequently despised savings &amp; loans (the
equivalent of the British building society). Ironically, the one stock he
chooses from the UK - Body Shop - is one of his few mistakes. It has fallen
by a third since he first recommended it in early 1991.
Investment managers tend to be classed in two camps. The 'growth' investors
are those who look for companies with good businesses and a long record of
profit increases. A classic growth stock would be Glaxo, which until
recently seemed to move only one way - up. Its shares may have looked
expensive on a price-earnings ratio basis but that did not seem to matter.
In the 1980s, it was always a good time to buy Glaxo shares.
The opposite school is that of 'value' investment. These managers look for
stocks which have fallen out of favour with the market and thus trade at
very cheap prices. A good recent example of this in the UK was Next. It was
one of the glamour retailers of the 1980s but its stock plunged following
the departure of founder George Davies. New management has turned the
company around - the shares have risen tenfold over the last 27 months.
Both schools have their flaws. Even the best managed companies cannot grow
at 30 per cent per year for ever. If a stock is trading on a high p/e, then
the fall in the share price can be precipitate when the company starts to
falter (Glaxo has fallen by a third since its peak in early 1992). And the
market is often right when it hammers the shares of companies - the value
investor can find that some of his picks go bust.
Lynch takes an eclectic approach which uses both the value and growth
philosophies. He is really searching for 'tenbaggers' - companies with the
potential to give tenfold returns. But he can find those among restaurants
and retailers as well as in fallen angels such as the early 1980s Chrysler.
His biggest single profit came from the unglamorous Federal National
Mortgage Association.
He describes how, when he is looking for retailing stocks, he heads to his
local shopping mall. 'I don't think of it as browsing,' he writes, 'I think
of it as fundamental analysis on the intriguing lineup of potential
investments, arranged side by side for the convenience of stock shoppers. If
you like the store, chances are that you'll love the stock.'
To give all amateur investors hope, he cites how a group of 12- to
13-year-olds at St Agnes School in Massachusetts produced a portfolio which
rose 70 per cent over two years, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and 99 per cent
of all equity mutual funds (the US equivalent of unit trusts) in the
process. Those children picked the stocks in companies they knew such as
Nike training shoes, Pepsi and the Gap (where most bought their clothes).
At St Agnes, the pupils recite the lesson 'you should invest in several
stocks because out of every five you pick one will be very great, one will
be really bad and three will be OK.'
Lynch argues that 'an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to
companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95
per cent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun in
doing it.'
The most useful section of the book is probably the part where he explains
how he selected the 21 stocks which he recommended to readers of Barrons
magazine in January 1992. Over the next 14 months, despite the odd dud such
as Body Shop, those stocks rose by an average 61.7 per cent, according to
USA Today. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up just 9 per cent over the same period.
An example of his reasoning was his selection of General Motors, a company
which seems to have had nothing but bad news over recent years. It reported
a Dollars 23bn deficit for 1992, the largest loss in US corporate history.
As Lynch writes, the general perception was 'powerful enterprise forgets how
to make cars, loses the public's confidence, lays off thousands of workers,
heads for the scrapheap of has-been corporations.'
'It was all this negativity about GM that attracted me in 1991' adds Lynch.
After looking at the third quarter 1990 report, he noticed that GM's other
divisions, such as Ross Perot's old company, EDS, were doing well. 'If the
company can only break even on the US auto business' he reasoned 'it could
earn Dollars 6 to Dollars 8 a share in 1993. Giving these earnings a p/e
ratio of 8, the stock should sell for Dollars 48-Dollars 64, a big advance
from the current price.' Since he made his selection, GM shares have risen
24 per cent to Dollars 38-plus, well ahead of the market. Simple, really.

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home cover rates soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S news that Abbey National is to increase its premium rates for
home contents insurance by some 37 per cent is considerably less dramatic
than it might appear.
Abbey National, the country's second biggest mortgage lender, sells
insurance on behalf of a panel of three insurers - Commercial Union, Royal
Insurance and Legal &amp; General - and said that it was increasing rates
because domestic theft claims had gone 'through the roof.'
It announced on Tuesday an average increase of more than 26 per cent in
rates for 1993. Some customers could also pick up an additional rise of 10
per cent announced in December last year, taking their total increase to 37
per cent.
But these were the first increases by Abbey for more than two years, during
which time insurers have increased premiums by an average of 40 per cent - a
rise which is itself dwarfed by the increase in the cost of theft claims.
The cost of theft from homes has increased by more than 200 per cent since
the end of 1989, to Pounds 749m in 1992.
Last year alone theft costs rose by 27 per cent according to figures
released last month by the Association of British Insurers, the trade
association.
'Theft losses have reached epidemic proportions. In this environment it is
not surprising to see vigorous rating action taking place,' said John
Chester, an analyst with SG Warburg, in a recent note by the securities
house.
Although UK insurers saw their results improve in 1992, only two of the
leading six non-life companies - Commercial Union and Guardian Royal
Exchange - registered profits. In 1990 and 1991 the six companies lost more
than Pounds 2bn and saw their financial strength severely eroded.
Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, another securities house, said:
'People just have to look at the claims costs. Looking at the results that
the companies produced last year you can hardly argue that people are being
ripped off.'
Not surprisingly, few observers are quibbling with the need for rate rises,
but some suggest that the industry may not be doing enough to isolate the
highest risks and that the increases are being unfairly charged across the
board.
'Everyone is suffering from the poor experience of the few,' said Peter
Friend, of brokers Leslie &amp; Godwin.
Friend suggests that insurers ought to evaluate the risks of individual
householders more carefully and tailor premiums to individual risks. Leslie
&amp; Godwin already does this for their wealthier customers, through its
Artscope International scheme.
Insurers have already begun to be more discriminating. They began to charge
higher rates for residents of inner city areas and other 'high risk' areas
some years ago. Premium rates now vary widely according to post code.
In addition, a number of insurers are offering discounts to householders who
instal good quality locks or reliable alarm systems and join police-approved
Neighbourhood Watch Schemes.
'We are very keen to reward customers who take a responsible attitude to
protecting their homes and strongly believe in helping them fight crime,'
said Brian Richards, personal insurance development manager at Norwich
Union.
But Friend still says they could do more, by, for example, taking into
account factors such as occupation, level of occupancy and 'lifestyle'. 'The
fact is that a couple without children who are out all the time are more
likely to suffer from thefts,' he says.
Already there are signs that some in the industry may be taking the hint.
Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, which
insures 250,000 householders, says that it is reviewing its rating structure
and could announce changes later this year.

FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Tesco lays an egg in the City - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE THE frustrated buyer played by Dudley Moore in its TV advertisements,
constantly chasing chickens without ever catching them, Tesco, the
supermarket chain, must be wondering just what it has to do to please the
City.
For most other companies, a 6.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 580.9m during a recession - the figures reported by Tesco this week -
would be impressive. Moreover, the operating margin rose from 7.1 to 7.6 per
cent, while operating profits were up 14 per cent, reflecting its
ever-increasing efficiency.
But after nine years of pre-tax profit increases of between 19 and 43 per
cent, the latest figure represented a significant slow-down and did little
to boost Tesco's shares which are about 60p below the 293p they reached a
year ago.
Tesco has undergone quite a transformation since the 1970s, when it was a
sprawling mass of mainly small shops. In the 1980s, it moved towards
value-added retailing from large superstores.
Profits leapt from Pounds 176m in 1986 to Pounds 545.5m in 1991, and Tesco
was established, together with J Sainsbury and Argyll, owner of Safeway, as
one of the UK's most powerful and sophisticated food retailers. Then, last
year, things started to go slightly awry.
Food retailing shares were hit by the realisation they were not immune from
recession. Tesco suffered particularly from rumours that its newly-opened
stores were trading below expectations. With store developments costing up
to Pounds 35m, and high fixed operating costs, any shortfall in the
computer-projected sales volumes can have serious consequences.
Tesco strongly denied those rumours again this week. David Reid, finance
director, said that its newest stores were exceeding their targets, and many
had already reached a creditable Pounds 14.50 of weekly sales per square
foot.
Most important, Tesco was still making a return on investment of about 19
per cent from new stores. But analysts point out that that compares with the
24 or 25 per cent return achieved by Safeway, whose developments tend to be
smaller and cheaper.
More recently, the City began to worry about poor sales growth in Tesco's
older stores. That was something this week's figures could not hide.
Subtract the 7.5 per cent accounted for by new stores, and the 2.4 per cent
by food price inflation, from the total sales increase of 9 per cent, and it
turns out that 'like-for-like' sales - those at existing stores - fell by
0.9 per cent. That compares with small increases in like-for-like sales at
Sainsbury and Safeway.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, says the poor performance is due to
'trading down' by its customers, who, as mainly younger people in
metropolitan areas, have been hit harder by the recession than those of its
rivals. The big question is whether they will ever trade back up again. Some
analysts fear Tesco customers are the most susceptible to the growing
discount sector - cut-price stores such as Kwik Save, Aldi and Netto.
That may be why Sir Ian was keen to stress that Tesco would launch tactical
price promotions in areas where it competes against discounters, and would
continue to offer lesser-known 'tertiary' brands of 70 to 100 of the most
popular products at prices that match those of the discounters.
Tesco's expansion efforts are no longer going solely into superstores. It is
experimenting with a smaller city-centre format, Metro. It has also dipped
its toe into the water in Europe, with the Pounds 175m acquisition of
Catteau, a 90-store supermarket chain in northern France. But such
experiments have been seen by some, perhaps uncharitably, as further
evidence that all is not well with Tesco's superstore programme. As Paul
Smiddy, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, put it: 'The City will need to see a
sustained period of like-for-like sales growth before it alters its view on
Tesco.'
If a consumer upturn does occur, Tesco should be a recovery stock, but the
City prefers Argyll, whose store portfolio and customer base are seen as the
safest of the three majors. In spite of its strength, it may be some time
before Tesco catches its chickens.

WALL STREET'S love affair with brand-name consumer stocks ran on to the
rocks this week. On Monday and Tuesday, heavy selling hit a wide range of
consumer issues which, in turn, lopped a few points off the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. The spark for the sell-off was the surprise decision by
food and tobacco group Philip Morris to cut the price of its top branded
cigarettes, Marlboro. in an attempt to win back customers lost to cheaper
brands.
Investors were unnerved by the move because it showed thatan
industry-leading company recognised that top-brand goods can lose market
share to much cheaper brandless products.
For the best part of a decade, investors have supported brand-name consumer
stocks on the premise that these companies could maintain earnings growth by
raising the prices on their best-known products - which, supposedly, were
immune from competition from discounters because massive promotion and a
strong, well-established image had guaranteed consumer loyalty.
However, recent experience with the world's best-selling cigarettes, seems
to have shattered that illusion. With smokers switching from Marlboro to
discounted generic brands in increasing numbers, Philip Morris was forced to
do something to stem its loss of market share. Other than spending even more
on advertising and promotion, its only choice was to cut the price of
Marlboro.
This momentous decision left investors reeling: if it could happen to
Marlboro, arguably one of the world's most famous products, it could happen
to any other brand name. Consequently, they wasted no time in selling stocks
such as Colgate-Palmolive, Heinz, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg, Campbell Soup
and Coca-Cola. So unsettled were investors that they unloaded a wide range
of consumer-related stocks including retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot
and Sears, Roebuck. Wal-Mart appeared to be a particularly unfortunate
victim, given its remarkable recent earnings growth and solid prospects.
However, there was some logic to the sell-off. Wal-Mart's February
same-store sales figures were disappointing; Home Depot was looking
extremely expensive with a price-earnings ratio of almost 60; and Sears'
shares had enjoyed an excellent run of late on recovery hopes and were
probably due to take a breather.
Such explanations aside, however, the heavy selling still was unnerving. The
brand-name consumer stocks and fast-growth discount retailers have been a
mainstay of the market for years. Any substantial reversal in this stalwart
group could mark a big turning point in the market's longer-term prospects.
Fortunately, when investors rushed out of consumer stocks, their money did
not leave the market altogether. Funds were switched to other sectors. This
week, it was the turn of cyclicals, cars, timber and transportation stocks
to benefit.
Cyclicals were an obvious choice for investors suddenly disenchanted with
consumer stocks. The economy continues to grow at a solid, if unspectacular,
pace and the likes of Caterpillar, International Paper and Alcoa should
churn out good earnings over the next year or so as the pace of business
activity across the country, and eventually overseas, picks up.
Likewise, car-makers. Over the past few months, there has been a growing
feeling of confidence in the big three - a sense that all of them have
turned a corner. It is no surprise that, as of Thursday, Ford shares were
standing at a 52-week high while Chrysler and GM were within spitting
distance of similar peaks.
While forestry product stocks may have been something of a cyclical play,
they drew most of their strength this week from the so-called 'timber
summit' meeting in Oregon between the logging industry and
environmentalists, chaired by a consensus-seeking President Clinton.
Although the summit failed to heal the divisions between the two sides,
investors were cheered by reports that the president probably will avoid any
initiatives that might depress timber industry profits.
Finally, airline stocks had an excellent week. All the major carriers posted
big gains, in the process lifting the Dow Jones Transportation Average to a
record.
Several factors were behind the buying. One was United Airlines reporting a
17.4 per cent jump in March passenger traffic and also announcing big cuts
in capital spending. There was also news from Washington DC that a joint
committee of congressional and presidential experts is to investigate ways
to help the industry survive its seemingly never-ending crisis.

More advanced information will be made available to equity investors from
July 1 with the introduction of total return indices for equities. The new
indices will take account of dividend income as well as capital growth and
will allow investors to compare more closely the performance of their unit
and investment trusts (and indeed the building society) with the market. The
figures will be calculated gross of tax and will assume that the dividend
and tax credit are reinvested on the ex-dividend date. Total return indices
will be available for the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE mid 250, the FT-SE Actuaries
350, the FT-SE SmallCap and the FT-A All-share.

Figures for Gift Aid, the scheme which allows tax-free donations to
charities, show that people were less generous in the three months leading
up to Christmas. Total donations during the final quarter of 1992 were
Pounds 43.4m, disappointingly down from Pounds 68m in the previous quarter.
Donations from individuals fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 25.5m.
However, the total donated under the scheme now stands at Pounds 351.1m in
two years, while a total of Pounds 117m has been paid in tax repayments to

FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES figures proves the lure of
risk-free tax shelters - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The BES binged last year on non-recourse loans, which made up a large part
of Pounds 957m invested in the schemes. Figures, prepared by the
Allenbridge, show just how much happier people are to shelter from tax if
they do not have to take a risk. Before property investments were allowed,
the most the scheme had ever raised in one tax year was Pounds 175m, in
1987-88. The amount raised by trading companies fell to Pounds 29m the next
year, rose to Pounds 36m in 1989-90, and then fell to Pounds 10m. Meanwhile,
the totals taken by the scheme have risen steadily as sponsors squeezed out
still more risk. One of the scheme's starting aims was to foster the
entrepreneurial spirit, and it seems to have failed. See BES: cause for
anxiety, Page VI

FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Coming to terms with the Hillary factor - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT HAS happened to the Wellcome share price over the past month is a case
of the market kicking a company when it is down. The shares were over 930p
in mid-March. Yesterday, they closed at 700p, a drop of 25 per cent.
There are three forces at work, all negative. First is the cloud hanging
over the sector as a whole, personified by Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is
drafting the blueprint for the promised US health care reforms;
significantly, US health care stocks reached their peak, relative to the
market as a whole, in the first weeks of 1992 just as Bill Clinton's
campaign for the presidency started to look credible.
Even without political impetus, drug prices face downward pressure as
insurers, employers and health systems round the world become increasingly
reluctant to write the industry a blank cheque.
The result is poor performance by drugs stocks, worldwide. During the first
quarter of 1993, the healthcare stocks covered by the FT-Actuaries World
index have dropped 10 per cent in local currency terms, while the world
index as a whole has risen 4 per cent.
Within the UK, fears about pricing are not the only factor affecting the
sector. A second influence is the shift by investors out of defensive stocks
and into cyclical ones, as the economic upswing begins.
Pharmaceuticals companies are classic defensive stocks - steady demand,
pricing protected by patents and regulations, a growth path dictated by what
comes out of the labs rather than what is in the customer's pocket. As the
economy dived into recession, the big internationally minded UK drug stocks
 -Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - benefited hugely from their
defensive status.
As demand picks up, though, steady earnings growth looks dull by comparison
with recovery stories. Companies in the sectors most affected by the
economic cycle stand a chance of doubling or tripling their earnings
overnight; drug stocks do not.
The relative performance of the health and household sector of the
FT-Actuaries All-Share, dominated by the big drugs stocks, shows how this
works. In the first half of 1992, as hopes of economic recovery emerged, the
sector weakened relative to the market. As the summer fears of a continuing
recession set in, the sector started to gain once more. When devaluation
made eventual recovery more certain, the relative slide resumed, to gather
pace in recent weeks.
Wellcome's performance shows what happens when you add specific company
problems to those general concerns.
On Thursday of last week, the outlook suddenly worsened for sales of
Wellcome's most glamorous drug, its anti-Aids preparation Retrovir.
Preliminary data from a Franco-British study indicated that, for patients
who had not yet developed full Aids, Retrovir had little to offer. The share
price fell immediately; since the study appeared, it has dropped 8 per cent.
Drug companies frequently encounter setbacks to important drugs, and the
market usually over-reacts. After a few days, investors remember that the
company has other eggs in its basket, and the share price recovers. Earlier
this week, it looked as if just that process was under way. On Monday, for
example, when the stock market as a whole was down sharply in the aftermath
of Friday's slide in New York, Wellcome managed a healthy recovery. The
worst seemed over.
On Wednesday, however, the pattern of recovery was jolted. Wellcome met
analysts to put its case over Retrovir, but the audience was not convinced.
The share price resumed its slide: it dropped another 23p, closing at 698p.
On Thursday, it recovered to 703p, a net rise of 8p since the previous
Friday.
The Retrovir issue aside, Wellcome and others in the industry have some
bumpy weeks ahead: Hillary Clinton's health-care plan is due by early May.
The stock has some protection, however, in its relatively unglamorous
rating: at 19 or so, the price/earnings ratio is the lowest it has been
since the company was floated in 1986, leaving Wellcome trailing behind such
stocks as BICC, Thorn EMI, or ICI. And, though the yield at 2.3 does not
sound particularly generous, it is the highest since the stock was first
available to the public.
Such valuation calculations are also applied to the market as a whole.
Econometric research just published by Goldman Sachs explores the extent to
which they are a useful indicator of whether shares are cheap or dear.
Looking at the UK market as a whole, the Goldman analysts conclude that the
best indicator is the yield ratio (the ratio of the yield on long-term
government bonds to the dividend yield on equities).
This will not come as a surprise to the equity market, since the yield ratio
is probably its most common rule of thumb. More interesting, perhaps, is
Goldman's creation of a Composite Valuation Indicator, which bundles
together all the measures commonly used to assess the market's value,
assigning each the importance justified by how successful it is in
'explaining' stock market movements.
This indicator works, the Goldman analysts say: trading on the basis of the
indicator over the last 20 years would have doubled your money compared with
a simple buy-and-hold strategy. At the moment, the indicator suggests the UK
stock market is undervalued by around 10 per cent.
No one seemed to be paying much attention to that sort of calculation this
week: the FT-SE 100 index closed on Thursday at 2821.8, a drop of 48.1
points since Friday and a decline of 4 1/2 per cent since its peak earlier
in the year. Investors were partly marking time before the holiday, partly
peering edgily ahead to find the good news already implicit in share prices.
As the Wellcome tale shows, that sort of market is easily spooked.

FT  10 APR 93 / The Long View: Selling the truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUTH attracts a good press but, often, it fails to get an enthusiastic
reception out there in the market-place. It is human nature to like to be
told a story, even a little white lie.
This is a roundabout way of getting into the debate over the accountants who
are creating a stir by improving the quality of financial reporting. Their
proposed new accounting standard, FRS3, has caused certain (but by no means
all) company finance directors, City investment analysts and even financial
editors to agonise over the loss of their simple, and supposedly reliable,
earnings-per-share numbers.
The Accounting Standards Board also is attacking the lax approaches to
off-balance sheet reporting (now you see the debts, now you don't) and
takeover accounting which created a rich field for 1980s' financial
manipulators. But it has still to prove that truth will be popular.
The accountants, in their role as company auditors, supposedly developed an
answer to the problem of financial reporting years ago. It was called the
'true and fair view,' Fortunately for the commercial prosperity of the
accountancy profession, the view did not live up to its name.
To achieve high fees, providers of corporate services such as lawyers and
accountants must be efficient at facilitating the ambitions of their
clients. They are rewarded for telling their clients how to do something,
not that a particular deal or profit target is impossible. But when, in the
end, a string of apparently healthy companies such as Coloroll and Parkfield
Group suddenly disappeared in puffs of smoke, the position of the auditing
profession became impossible. The clean-up began.
If you detect a whiff of cynicism, I plead extenuating circumstances on the
ground that I endured a 10-year debate on inflation accounting, starting in
the 1970s. Quite early on, the profession produced a perfectly decent, if
rough-and-ready, inflation accounting standard that would have served
investors' interests perfectly well. But government and industry opposed it,
and later proposals became more complex without becoming more popular.
Simply, most listed companies did not want to publish inflation-adjusted
profit figures that were lower than the conventional historical cost
version. To some extent, the stock market realised there was a problem,
which is why the average price-earnings ratio was about 7 or 8 late in the
1970s compared with near 20 in today's conditions of low inflation; the
difference reflects largely the poor quality of 1970s' earnings.
But many companies appeared to take a wholly exploitative approach. Thus,
British Gas published current cost/profit figures (nice low numbers) while
it was a public corporation seeking to avoid price curbs, but majored on
substantially higher historical cost numbers as soon as privatisation loomed
and it wanted to maximise its share price.
The same cosmetic approach was applied to takeovers. When one company
acquires another, often there are heavy extra costs. If there are measures
to rationalise the operations of the two companies, disruption will follow
and the benefits, if any, usually will not be achieved for several years.
So, you would think the obstacles to takeovers would be formidable, and that
takeovers would be rare.
The problems were solved by accountants, though. Costs disappeared,
provisions were written back and profits rose smoothly - to the extent that
it was argued sometimes during the takeover boom that such and such a
company needed another acquisition soon if it was to maintain its profits
growth. Years later, however, many acquisitive companies like Burton and
Storehouse ran into big trouble.
The truth will come out one day, but who is in a hurry? Investors prefer
companies that deliver steady growth in earnings and dividends, and
companies that fit such a description go to a premium. In the real world,
profits move erratically up and down in a way which accentuates the risks.
So, accountants and lawyers have been brought into play to create techniques
and structures to generate the required image.
Risk-averse institutional investors, reluctant to commit money to highly
cyclical makers of building materials or engineering components, tend to
prefer the likes of Hanson or BTR (or, perhaps these days, some of their
less geriatric emulators). Do such rambling conglomerates become so large
because they provide brilliant industrial management, or because they
re-package industry into a form assimilable by the stock market?
Part of the problem is one of corporate governance: that auditors are too
much under the thumb of managements, and have only a minimal relationship
with the shareholders to whom they are supposed to be responsible. A strong
and independent audit committee might help, but such committees rarely are
strong and independent in the companies where they really need to be.
More fundamentally, my experiences in the inflation accounting debate led me
to conclude that shareholders did not really want to know the truth. During
the 1980s, the complacency seemed almost to develop into a kind of
conspiracy of optimism. Who wanted to expose the realities of Polly Peck?
Managers and shareholders and stockbrokers all wanted a high share price. A
successful and growing company would generate high fees for the City of
London. The important thing was not to be left stranded when the game ended.
Now, we have to watch the investors and analysts as the anti-cosmetic
Accounting Standards Board scrapes the make-up from company accounts. What
remains might not always be a pretty sight: bumpy where you thought it was
smooth and hard to recognise and understand. Perhaps the rouge and the
mascara are being rejected forever. But human nature does not change, and
the search will be on for a different kind of face-lift.

FT  10 APR 93 / Science: saviour or tool of the Devil?: AC Grayling argues
that it offers hope eventually of defeating oppressive religious
superstitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOVELIST Susan Howatch has offered Pounds 1m to help resolve that great
argument of the 20th century: are the advances of science destroying
religion? Her gift, to the faculty of divinity at Cambridge university, has
been made at a time when science is under fierce attack. The most recent
assault is not from organised religion but from those who claim the wider
message of science is destructive, presumptuous, or wrong.
Despite increasing popular sympathy for this view, Howatch believes science
and religion can co-exist peaceably and cites John Polkinghorne, a Cambridge
physicist turned cleric, as an example of how this can be achieved, even in
the same person. But she faces a battle to persuade sceptics. Richard
Dawkins, an Oxford biologist, says: 'What has theology ever said that is of
the smallest use to anybody? When has theology ever said anything that is
demonstrably true and is not obvious?'
Dawkins, who wrote The Blind Watchmaker, a best-seller which champions
Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution, seems to suggest that religion is
under siege from science. But, in the present debate, the issue seems to be
the other way around. Big sales have been achieved by anti-science books,
notably Bryan Appleyard's Understanding The Present, which leapt to second
place in the best-seller lists in its first week of publication. A more
fundamental attack on the basis of scientific method was launched last year
by historian John Ralston Saul. In his book, Voltaire's Bastards, he says
science has 'turned on man,' poisoning his environment and food and
threatening his extinction.
Scientists themselves are worried that public hostility to their work is
contributing to the chronic shortage of funds for research. In a speech at
the Royal Institution in February, Professor Dennis Noble, a distinguished
Oxford medical scientist, suggested that British science might be
under-funded because it is viewed as 'the ultimate pact with the Devil.'
Noble thinks many people regard science as the source of society's ills, not
just because of pollution and disasters such as Chernobyl but through 'the
perception that science is deeply and irretrievably dehumanising.'
Science has always had its critics, but the present attack is remarkable
because it comes at the end of a century of scientific achievement which has
transformed the human condition - mostly for the good.
In the 17th century, science's chief opponent was the Inquisition. Deny that
the earth moves, priests told astronomers, or be burnt at the stake. In the
19th century, the anti-science attack was directed at evolutionary theory:
in the course of a public lecture, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce tried to
rubbish Darwin's theory by asking whether the great scientist was descended
from monkeys on his mother's or his father's side. Half the population of
the United States in 1993 still shares Wilberforce's creationist view.
Today, science's opponents form a coalition which complains that science is
destructive, soul-less, and antipathetic to religion. Such people desire
personal significance, a safe place in the universe, a sense of ultimate
value. All this, they claim, is threatened by science. John Brooke, a senior
lecturer in the history of science at Lancaster university, says in Science
and Religion (1991): 'Science has generated its own penumbra of ignorance .
. . (and) ethical problems that it is powerless to solve.'
In reply, scientists point to the enormous benefits of research which,
often, are taken for granted: electric light, antibiotics, air transport,
telecommunications, central heating and the computer. Indeed, some believe
that the achievements of science can be compared with the artistic and
humanistic revolution of the Renaissance.
Some critics emphasise the destructive effects of science, particularly in
war, and its threat to the environment. Others, such as Louise Anthony in A
Mind of One's Own (1993), see science as an instrument of oppression in
advanced societies. Anthony, professor of philosophy at North Carolina State
university, writes: 'Institutionalised science serves, in fact, to sustain
and even enhance existing structures of inequality and domination.' But
scientists can reply that these are abuses of scientific discoveries and not
the fault of those who seek knowledge.
Some critics are alarmed by science's picture of the universe as a neutral,
contingent realm, purely material in composition and subject to
dispassionate laws. They would prefer the universe to have a purpose, to be
the outcome of design, and to be governed by benevolent forces. Others are
worried by the thought that our cherished view of ourselves as creative,
ethical beings, sensitive to beauty and capable of love, will be explained
by science in terms merely of chemical processes.
These supposed threats have led to violent responses. In his attack,
Appleyard claims the 'bitter message' of science is that the universe offers
no consolations; it does not exist for a reason, it just exists brutally
'like some thick-witted skinhead - mute, gormless and callous.' Science has
emptied the universe of 'goodness, purpose and meaning' and threatens a
'terrible inversion' of human values. It is frightening, spiritually
corrosive and belittling. Science's worst crime, says Appleyard, is that it
ventures no answer to the question: Why is there a universe at all?
It seems to me that the chief reason behind hostility to science is exactly
what Howatch wishes were otherwise: its threat to religion. Some argue there
is no such threat and point to the many distinguished scientists who have
been religious: Newton, Michael Faraday and Howatch's own present-day
example, Polkinghorne, who prefers a dog collar to a chair of physics. But
the fact is that if the propositions of science and those of religion are
taken on an equal footing, as each offering the factual truth about the
universe, they are squarely inconsistent.
The central, methodological principle of science is that every step in
enquiry and experiment has to be public, repeatable, checkable and
challengeable. It is this that gives authority to scientific theories.
Critics offer alternative authorities for our beliefs: ancient writings,
intuition, mystical insight, ethnic traditions, eco-biology, the teachings
of sages or the example of heroes.
What gives support to the claim that these are genuine sources of knowledge
is the new intellectual fashion called post-modernism. This says there is no
single set of truths about the world but as many different ways of seeing it
as there are cultures or even individuals.
There is no legitimate way of judging between viewpoints, post-modernists
argue; it is merely intellectual imperialism to claim that, for example,
western medicine is better than traditional African witch-doctoring. This
view is known as relativism. Thus, Susan Hekman, professor of political
science at the University of Texas, Arlington, writes in Gender and
Knowledge (1990): 'Post-modernism undermines the rationality of science by
allowing us to see that science is rooted in specific historical assumptions
and, therefore, is not universal or absolute.'
Such critics reveal ignorance of what science really is. It is true that
some admirers believe it will provide the answer to everything one day; but
this view, known as scientism, is a hopeless caricature of the true nature
of science - which is much more sceptical, tentative, and limited in its
objectives than either its extreme admirers or extreme critics realise.
When people talk of 'science,' they forget there are many sciences. Particle
physics and cosmology (the study of the origins and nature of the universe)
are the two most-quoted fields of enquiry, not least because great efforts
are now being made to bring together the two theories (quantum and
relativity) which are central to each and which, so far, appear
inconsistent. But other sciences give rise to much less controversy. Many -
like medical science - are of such immediate and obvious benefit that it is
hard to see how critics can maintain their general hostility.
Science proceeds by subjecting hypotheses to rigorous examination, wherever
possible experimentally. Failure to prove a theory false does not mean the
theory is true - only that it can be used until something better turns up.
So, all science is defensible and open-ended; further evidence can refute or
change it.
Science lives by enquiry, of which the essence is scepticism and
open-mindedness. Each branch is concerned with a defined range of phenomena.
No-one supposes that the important questions of aesthetics and politics
could be resolved in a test tube. Yet critics believe, vaguely, that this is
what scientists aspire to - which shows they do not understand what they
criticise.
The open-mindedness of science, and its need to thrive on challenge and
debate, contrasts sharply with religion. Religions are governed by dogma and
tradition, in defence of which - incredibly - some people are prepared to
kill and die. Religions have been among the most destructive of historical
phenomena; examples of oppressive and violent persecution abound.
Despite the personal solace religion offers (a psychological function
performed by other things also, such as art and love), and the artistic
inspiration it has prompted (although such inspiration comes from other
sources besides), on the organised scale it can be dangerous and cruel.
Science is progressive and cumulative; religion is static and
backward-looking. Mankind's hope might lie in this fact, for it suggests
that open-minded curiosity might eventually defeat oppressive superstitions.
Voltaire once remarked that he loved the man who sought truth, but hated the
man who claimed to have found it. One was a scientist, the other a priest.
Perhaps Howatch's Pounds 1m will help us to re-discover Voltaire's insight.
It might not be what she hoped for, but it would finally end the conflict
between science and religion.

FT  10 APR 93 / Easter rain brings spring cheer for estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BRITAIN'S housing market shows strong signs of a recovery, estate agents
are hoping the Easter weekend - traditionally the beginning of the busiest
period of the year for house sales - will be their most profitable for
years.
Sales over the next few weeks will determine whether the revival will last
or peter out as in previous springs. Estate agents' offices and show houses
are likely to be open throughout the holiday weekend.
Though the heaviest business normally begins on Easter Saturday, the signs
yesterday in the area hardest hit - the south east - were good. Pocock &amp;
Shaw, a Cambridge estate agency, said: 'We had expected Good Friday to be
rather quiet; instead we have been frantically busy.
'The wet weather may have helped us in that people, instead of going for a
day out, have been coming in to ask about properties. We have seen between
50 and 60 people.'
Mr Henry Rowe, an estate agent in Saffron Walden, Essex, said the holiday
had got off to an encouraging start.
Mr Kevin Moll, Mr Rowe's partner, said: 'We have sold 70 homes since the
beginning of this year, about a quarter more than during the first three
months of last year. We are currently averaging about 20 sales a month. In
two days last weekend we had 15 offers to buy.
'There have been periods over the past four years when sales have been at
this level but we have not had such a sustained recovery as we have seen
this year.'
Mr Jonathan Harvey, director of Friend &amp; Falcke, which sells in London's
Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said: 'Sales are up about 60 per cent
on the first three months of last year.
'A lot of these are to foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling's
devaluation. Purchases by Britons, however, are still up by 15 per cent to
20 per cent on the same period last year.'
Their experience has been shared by estate agents, housebuilders and
building societies in other parts of the country.
Sales figures for 15 of the country's largest national housebuilders show
offers to buy new homes have risen by approaching a third during the first
13 weeks of this year. This includes sales to housing associations. Sales to
private sector buyers are estimated by builders to have risen by between a
fifth and a quarter.
The weekly figures, compiled by the Housebuilders Federation, measure net
reservations - sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations.
Net reservations for the 15 housebuilders, representing about 20 per cent of
the new housing market, totalled 5,000 in January and February, compared
with 4,200 in the first two months of last year.
This trend continued in March in spite of a slight slowdown in the week
before the Budget.
Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, the country's second
largest housebuilder, said: 'We have had an excellent start to the year
which we now hope to build upon. Prices have stopped falling. The next stage
will be to start withdrawing sales incentives such as discounts, cheap
mortgages and removal expenses. This is starting to happen in a few areas.
'Provided the recent revival is sustained we might even see prices starting
to rise again by the end of this year.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Japan may halt Cambodia operations over UN deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KILLING of a Japanese volunteer working for the United Nations in
Cambodia has brought a warning that Japan could withdraw from the country if
attacks on UN personnel increase.
Mr Toshio Nakayama, Japan's defence minister, said yesterday that 'if it
becomes clear that a widespread armed disruption of the (UN-organised
Cambodian) elections is in force, we must of course think of an emergency
evacuation or a halt in operations'.
About 600 Japanese military personnel are in Cambodia as part of the UN
operation. Although the victim, Mr Atsuhito Nakata, 25, was a civilian, his
death has prompted concern that Japanese forces could become entangled in an
intensifying conflict. Nevertheless, Japan yesterday continued with its
planned Cambodian involvement by despatching 250 army engineers to join an
advance team of 350 in Bangkok. This force is due to relieve the 600 troops
sent six months ago.
Mr Nakata was the sixth worker to be killed in nine direct attacks on UN
personnel in the past two weeks. His UN-marked car was stopped on Thursday
by a group of armed men. His Cambodian interpreter, Mr Lay Sokphip, was also
killed.
The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which is boycotting the UN's peace process,
has been blamed for some of the attacks and is suspected of most of the
rest. The group denies responsibility.
Japan's Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, yesterday
called for the immediate return of the 600 already in Cambodia, mostly
transportation personnel, on the grounds that the Cambodian conflict does
not fit the guidelines set for Japanese participation in a peacekeeping
operation.
Under those guidelines, Japanese personnel should not be despatched if a
ceasefire agreement has collapsed. The SDP argues that the spate of killings
shows the ceasefire is no longer effective.
But a sudden pull-out of troops would damage the image of the Japanese
government, which sees the participation as evidence that the country is
playing a more active role in international affairs. A retreat would also
hurt Tokyo's campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

FT  10 APR 93 / French rates predicted to fall 'significantly': Finance
minister sees confidence being restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government predicted yesterday that interest rates, which have
fallen on the money markets by up to 1.5 percentage points since the
conservatives won a sweeping election victory nearly two weeks ago, 'will
decrease significantly from now until the summer'.
Though Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, said there was no
question of pushing rates lower, he forecast that they would 'fall by
themselves' because of a restoration of confidence in the French economy and
currency.
Markets are speculating that the Bank of France will cut its upper official
rate - the five-day repurchase rate, currently at 12 per cent - next week.
Reaction to the new conservative government's programme, which Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, announced to parliament on Thursday, was
largely favourable. Stock market operators, however, expressed some dismay
at planned increases in indirect taxes to reduce a budget deficit which Mr
Balladur estimated would grow to FFr330bn (Pounds 39.9bn) this year or 3.4
per cent of national output.
The only discordant notes came from Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party's
new temporary leader, who said Mr Balladur had shown 'an amazing lack of
imagination', while the Communists' parliamentary group expressed its 'firm
opposition' to the Balladur plan. Nonetheless, Mr Balladur won his first
vote of confidence by 457 to 81 votes, with two abstentions.
Mr Balladur said that combatting unemployment, currently at 10.6 per cent of
the workforce, was his 'absolute priority', but he saw no hope of
stabilising job losses until the end of this year. He asked employers to lay
off workers only as a last resort.
Mr Francois Perigot, head of the Patronat employers' federation, yesterday
agreed that his members should remember that 'making someone redundant was a
serious matter'.
Mr Alphandery said draft legislation to give the Bank of France independence
and to privatise state-held companies would be ready before the end of next
week. He expected Parliament to approve both laws by the summer.
The French central bank has so far not chosen to reflect the easing of money
market rates in its official rates, in order to attract money into francs.
This has replenished its foreign exchange reserves, drained during the fight
to keep the franc tied to the D-Mark in recent months. Mr Alphandery said
the bank would repay loans from the Bundesbank several weeks before they
were due.
After the overnight money rate dropped to 10 1/8 per cent, and the rate for
one-month money fell to 9 5/8 per cent, on Thursday, many analysts saw
little sense in the Bank of France keeping its 'repo' rate at 12 per cent,
and predicted a possible cut on Tuesday. The central bank is considered
likely to maintain its intervention rate, at which it lends limited amounts
to banks, at 9.1 per cent.

FT  10 APR 93 / Change of heart by two banks blocked 3i flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor, and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE of heart by Barclays and National Westminster banks led to
Thursday's abandonment of an autumn share flotation by Investors in Industry
(3i), the venture capital group, it was understood yesterday.
Both banks, which together own 41 per cent of 3i, are thought to believe
that 3i's value is likely to increase sharply over the next two years, so
any flotation should be postponed for at least that long.
The abandonment of the flotation plan led to the resignation of 3i's
chairman, Mr Alan Wheatley, who joined the group last July on the
understanding that it would obtain a stock market listing. He will be
succeeded by Sir Max Williams, deputy chairman, until the appointment of a
permanent replacement.
The Bank of England is understood to be particularly disappointed that the
share sale has been shelved. 3i, which has net assets of Pounds 1.2bn and is
the leading provider of risk capital to small and medium-sized com-panies,
is owned by six of the UK's biggest banks and the Bank of England.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, which owns 13 per cent, said
there was no 'big split' between the banks on whether to sell. 'You would
not have got much of a price for the shares at the moment. Even for those
willing to consider selling, it depends on price,' he said.
Barings, 3i's merchant bank, had argued that the sale was in the banks'
interest. A month ago, Barings recommended to the banks that an autumn
flotation should go ahead, according to bankers and a 3i director. The
proposal was that the banks should sell a minority stake, leaving them with
between 60 and 75 per cent of the company.
Even though the depth of the UK recession meant the stock market price of
3i's shares would be less than some banks wanted, Barings believed that the
long-term value of their remaining shares would be increased by the
flotation for two reasons:
As a quoted company, 3i would for the first time have been able to take
advantage of its investment trust status. This would have meant that, as the
economy recovered, 3i would have been able to sell an increasing number of
investments but without paying capital gains tax.
3i would have raised additional capital in the flotation, allowing it to
take advantage of investment opportunities as economic growth returned.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet again 3i's shareholders have delayed the company's slide down the
slipway. Their indecision is puzzling. It has also sparked the abrupt
departure of 3i's recently-installed chairman who had been entrusted with
completing the flotation.
There is certainly no pressing need for shareholders to sell. Midland's
once-desperate need for capital has been reduced following its takeover by
HSBC. Other bank shareholders too have seen their financial pressures
lessen. They believe they can realise greater value by waiting for the
upswing. Since its disappointing interim results, 3i has reported that its
investments have risen strongly. There has also been a sharp increase in the
number of new investment applications.
But the stock market has already anticipated much of the recovery. In recent
months there has been a marked narrowing of the gap between asset values and
share prices in the quoted investment trust sector. 3i's size and reputation
could have perhaps ensured a flotation price just 10 per cent below its
asset value. Given that 3i was only going to be partially floated, it is
difficult to believe it could much improve on that. The suspicion must be
that the delay does not simply signify a change in market tactics but also a
reassessment of strategy. The banks should clarify their intentions.
Otherwise they will damage the company now and make it harder to float
later.

FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The thirst for a secure yield is working to the advantage of water
companies. The sector is close to the high point relative to the market
reached last August. Sterling was then shackled to the ERM and the outlook
elsewhere was grim. Given the brighter industrial picture, the relative
attractions of water might be expected to diminish. But that allows neither
for the dwindling returns on cash, nor for dividend cuts by other high-yield
stocks. The chancellor has meanwhile helped the cause by reducing the tax
credit on dividends paid to gross funds.
Water companies are unlikely to compensate gross funds for lost income. With
dividends covered around three times by earnings, most could afford to do
so. But such action would have to be explained to the regulator. The
companies might also prefer to conserve cover in case of tougher times
following next year's regulatory review. Yield support may thus imply a cap
on prices. The yield premium of the sector to the rest of the market is
already below 20 per cent. Things could get turbulent as the shares start to
trade ex-dividend.
Capital expenditure plans for the second half of the decade have not been
finalised, let alone the rate of return on capital the regulator will allow.
With the medium-term prospects so uncertain, the market is naturally
inclined to concentrate on the immediate attraction of yield. That looks
short-sighted, when there is now only a year to go before hard bargaining
begins with the regulator.

FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another thumping loss from Sun Alliance shows just how unbalanced the UK's
biggest insurer became during the 1980s. Its general insurance business was
weighted too heavily towards the UK and exposure to mortgage indemnity was
excessive. Yet the life assurance side is not big enough to offset the
impact of recession. On the investments side, faith in equities and property
paid off handsomely during years of asset price inflation. Thursday's
property write-down is the penalty. The net asset value is now little more
than half the Pounds 3bn peak reached in 1989.
Balance is belatedly being restored. By surrendering market share on UK
household insurance, Sun Alliance is reducing its exposure to freak storms
and floods. The acquisition of Denmark's Hafnia last month raises the
proportion of European premium income to 23 per cent - and adds weight to
the life business. Disposing of the big stakes in Commercial Union and Chubb
last year reduced exposure to equities in general and other insurers in
particular.
But there is no escaping the legacy of mortgage indemnity. The damage this
year should be below the Pounds 180m underwriting loss sustained in 1992.
But the rate of repossessions and the average cost per claim will only
gradually decline. The main comfort is that the balance sheet looks strong
enough to stand the strain. Even so, a solvency ratio of 50 per cent after
the acquisition of Hafnia would have been 7 points lower were it not for
sterling's devaluation. The position is not as robust as Sun Alliance would
have the market believe.

FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Downwards drift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union has not chosen a propitious time to announce a shift of its
investment strategy back towards equities. Though the FT-SE just held above
the 2,800 level on Wednesday, it still shed 48 points on the week. The
strongly negative reaction of companies like Wellcome, Fisons and BAT to
specific bad news suggests that individual valuations are stretched. All
things are relative, however, and Norwich Union's decision may say as much
about its fears for the gilts as about its hopes for the equity market.
Certainly the news that house prices are rising puts a faint whiff of
inflation back in the air. That will not help the long end of the gilt
market, especially in view of the government's heavy funding programme. It
may make the government even more reluctant to cut interest rates again,
despite the rise in sterling. That would leave the equity market without
justification for a further assault on the 3,000 level. While recovery does
seem to be taking hold, it is not strong enough to make much difference to
expectations for corporate earnings. For now the equity market still seems
interest-rate driven. Paradoxically, it may therefore react better to bad
economic news than to good.
Sterling's trade-weighted index is already back up to 80, where it stood
when interest rates were cut in January. The currency will become stronger
still if the government stays reluctant to cut rates once the Bundesbank
really starts to relax. That would hit equities on another front: the
export-related earnings growth factored in after the devaluation would
disappear into thin air.

FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation news leaves
Dow flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Good news on inflation and a big rally in bond prices failed to lift US
stock markets on Thursday, and the main indices all ended the shortened week
flat or lower, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.54 at 3,396.48.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.89 lower at 441.84,
while the Amex composite finished down 1.43 at 416.24, and the Nasdaq
composite 2.55 weaker at 666.33. NYSE trading volume was 282m shares.
Equities perked up briefly at the opening in reaction to the news that the
March producer price index rose 0.4 per cent. Although the increase was
above some forecasts, the bulk of the increase was attributable to higher
energy prices. If the volatile food and energy components were excluded from
the PPI, the 'core' rate of producer price inflation rose by only 0.1 per
cent.
After two months of higher-than-expected core PPI readings, the weak March
figure was a welcome sight for the inflation-sensitive bond market, where
prices surged, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue down to 6.85
per cent.
Ultimately, however, the good inflation news and the big drop in yields
failed to sustain equity prices, which quickly fell back from their early
highs. News of poor corporate earnings, coupled with some futures-related
sell programs, ensured that stocks remained in negative territory all day.
The big corporate story of the day was US Surgical, which plunged Dollars 15
1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 in volume of 7m shares after the company warned that
it expects second and third quarter sales, and second quarter profits, to be
significantly lower than a year ago.
Aluminium Company of America dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 60 3/8 in volume
of 1.5m shares as investors reacted badly to Wednesday's late announcement
that first quarter net income fell to 31 cents a share, down from 64 cents a
share a year earlier. After the news the brokerage house, Smith Barney,
reduced its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Philip Morris, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 in volume of 7m shares,
remained under selling pressure in the wake of last week's announcement that
it was slashing the price of its Marlboro cigarettes in an attempt to
salvage market share.
Westinghouse Electric climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 in busy trading
after the company announced it will sell, for Dollars 1bn, most of the
commercial property assets of its financial services unit to an partnership
run by investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Canada
TORONTO was depressed by losses in gold and metal shares after PainWebber
downgraded its recommendation for Alcan Aluminium. The TSE-300 composite
index eased 9.62 to 3,591.80, and turnover retreated from CDollars 514.6m to
CDollars 430m.

FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases after two
straight highs

AFTER another new high on Thursday, index-linked selling by investment
trusts and profit-taking by individuals left the Nikkei index moderately
lower yesterday, after a brief rise over the 20,000 level on technical
trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei, up 134.04 on Thursday to 19,967.27, shed 75.09 to 19,892.18, 2.3
per cent higher on the week, after a day's high of 20,126.09 and a low of
19,728.34 after Thursday's 20,041.16 and 19,721.01 respectively.
Volume rose from 664m shares to 750m on options-related trading. Advances
led declines by 568 to 490 with 125 unchanged. On Thursday, gainers
outnumbered losers by 600 to 473 with 125 unchanged. The Topix index, which
rose 9.48 to 1,568.70 on Thursday, fell 5.42 to 1,563.28.
While activity by foreigners was subdued due to the Easter holidays, life
insurers and public pension funds were seen purchasing stocks. Mr Chris
Newton said: 'Sentiment among investors has improved enormously, but the
market may face weakness after the government unveils its fiscal package
next week.'
Small stocks improved yesterday. The second section rose 1.8 per cent, while
the over-the-counter market registered a 6 per cent gain.
Profit-taking eroded securities companies. Nomura Securities lost Y40 to
Y2,170 and Daiwa Securities fell Y10 to Y1,290. Banks were also lower with
Industrial Bank of Japan retreating Y40 to Y2,650 and Fuji Bank losing Y10
to Y2,060.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y20,000 to Y1,03m. High-technology
issues were also lower on profit taking. However, Fujitsu, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y19 to Y706 on speculation that the company will
benefit from instalments of personal computers at public schools.
In Osaka, the OSE average, which Thursday improved 30.02 to 21,577.43, fell
1.03 to 21,576.40. Volume remained almost unchanged at 30m shares against
30.6m.
Roundup
TAIWAN, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were open yesterday after a mixed
day for the region on Thursday.
TAIWAN closed lower as turnover shrank, the weighted index ending 78.02, or
1.6 per cent down at 4,847.13, 2.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover
down from TDollars 56.6bn to TDollars 49.4bn.
After a 12-month peak on Wednesday, Thursday's 1.8 per cent fall had hurt
sentiment. In addition, there was concern that money market liquidity was
tightening, and that the supply of margin loans could shrink.
SEOUL firmed again after a setback on Thursday, the composite stock index
closing 7.86 higher at 702.93 to end the week with a 3.2 per cent gain on
the prospect of economic recovery. Turnover soared from Won589.9bn to
Won921.1bn.
KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed with the KLSE composite index down 1.99 at 655.24,,
0.6 per cent higher in the week, on renewed speculative buying of second and
third-line stocks.
Idris Hydraulic again led activity with 92.4 million shares traded. It
closed up 13 cents at MDollars 2.85.
BANGKOK saved its spurt until the last moment, as institutional buying of
major bank shares in the closing minutes of trade pushed the SET index up
4.22 to 862.71, up 0.6 per cent on the week.
On Thursday, AUSTRALIAN stocks rebounded at the close, with investors
encouraged by lower-than-expected jobless figures. The All Ordinaries index
added 10.8 to 1,665.7, 1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of ADollars
221.1m.
Fairfax was the star performer, rising 4 cents to a ADollars 2.02 high after
Publishing and Broadcasting, a private subsidiary of Mr Kerry Packer, said
that it owned 10.45 per cent of the voting shares.
BOMBAY, where the BSE index rose 97.24 on Wednesday in anticipation of an
interest rate cut, lost it all when the cut did not take place. The index
fell 97.77 to 2,310.91, virtually flat on the week.

FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan holds its gains in brisk
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN, open along with Brussels and Istanbul yesterday, managed once again
to set Italy's political scandals aside, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN's Comit index rose another 2.08 to 512.09, a rise of 7.7 per cent on
the week. Brokers said that turnover was surprisingly high, boosted by
Thursday's government restatement of its determination to move on
privatisation, and by final cabinet approval of the law on private pensions.
Among banks, one privatisation candidate, BCI, closed some L93 higher at
L4,695, but Credito Italiano slipped L35 to L2,710 as treasury statements on
Thursday were perceived as indicating that there will not be a public offer
of the shares.
BRUSSELS closed the shortened, pre-holiday session with the Bel-20 index
4.65 lower at 1,260.47. Business was concentrated mainly in blue chip stocks
but the big holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, barely reacted to
late Thursday's announcement of a 38 per cent rise in 1992 earnings, closing
BFr10 higher at BFr2,325.
ISTANBUL's market index swung between an early high of 6,914 and a low of
6,645 before bouncing up on late support to end 16.66 higher at a new
all-time high close of 6,754.11, 7.1 per cent higher on the week.
On Thursday, PARIS saw early gains obliterated by the absence of any easing
from the Bank of France, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's remark that
he was considering raising indirect taxes to balance the social security
system's accounts. The CAC-40 index finished just 2.90 higher at 1,986.86,
0.2 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was healthier at FFr3.23bn.
Michelin rose FFr3.70 to FFr168.80 on short covering, more than recovering
Wednesday's losses on a profits warning. However, L'Oreal, France's largest
cosmetics company, looked on safer ground with a FFr33 gain at FFr1,146
after Wednesday's late news of a 16 per cent gain in profits.
FRANKFURT recovered, the DAX index closing 5.42 higher at 1,655.73, 0.3 per
cent down on the week, in turnover down from DM5.6bn to DM4.6bn.
BMW rose DM7.50 to DM484.50, and Volkswagen by DM3 to DM311, as Daimler
recovered only DM1.20 to DM565 for a DM45.50, or 7.5 per cent drop on the
week. Mr Cord Suerie at Paribas Capital Markets said, however, that Paribas
maintained its buy rating on Daimler, remaining quite optimistic for the
group following its US listing.
Lufthansa rose DM4.30 to DM112, picking up on the excitement among airline
stocks elsewhere in Europe.
ZURICH edged higher, the 3.4 gain to 2,188.3 in the SMI index leaving it
little changed on the week. Swissair bearers rose SFr35, or 5.8 per cent to
SFr630 after the airline claimed at Wednesday's annual press conference to
be taking the initiative in talks about an alliance with KLM, SAS and
Austrian Airlines.
Analysts believe that any such link would provide substantial potential for
further cost cutting, and that it would open up a much larger market for the
Swiss group.
AMSTERDAM saw foreign demand as the CBS Tendency index edged 0.4 higher to
107.9, 1 per cent up on the week. Heineken, an outperformer being reassessed
by investors, shed Fl 2.40 to Fl 188.50 after Wednesday's flat 1992 earnings
and profits warning.
Unilever lost another Fl 1.60 to Fl 204.80 in response to lower earnings
estimates from London brokers. KLM picked up Fl 1.30 to Fl 29.40 and
Philips, finding renewed demand from US investors, added 70 cents to Fl
25.30.
Bursumij Wehry, the trading company, rose Fl 3.80 or 4.6 per cent to a
year's high of Fl 86 ahead of its annual report on Tuesday. The stock has
risen by Fl 15, or 21 per cent since March 16 when the company reported
higher 1992 net profits and forecast an improvement in 1993 earnings.
DUBLIN extended Wednesday's gains, the ISEQ overall index closing up 16.68
on the day at 1,522.44, 1.8 per cent better on the week.
Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy Stockbrokers said that the continuing fall in
money market rates had brought foreign buyers back into the market after
some profit-taking and that moderately sized companies like Avonmore and
Waterfood, in the food business, and Independent Newpapers had taken over
from the biggest blue chips at the top of the performance charts.

FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners climb aboard the Lima
rollercoaster - Peru's fast growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment is the driving force behind Lima's small, but lively
bolsa. Since March 18, when Peru finally normalised relations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, and became re-eligible
for loans, both daily volume and the general shares index have registered
sharp increases. And foreign buyers account for around two-thirds of all
activity.
The long-awaited IMF approval for Peru's economic programme boosted the
index by 18 per cent in a week, while volumes traded rose to around
USDollars 5.5m a day, an all-time record.
However, the market's equity capitalisation had already jumped from
USDollars 1.4bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 2.6bn 12 months later. The
Lima bolsa was the second most profitable in the world last year, according
to International Finance Corporation figures - up 125 per cent in dollar
terms and streets ahead of all other Latin American stock markets. Leading
Peruvian brokers are predicting a similar performance this year.
'It's the confidence factor,' says Mr Jose Luque Otero, president of the
Lima bolsa's board. 'The rules of the game are clear and foreign investors
appreciate that.'
Like all emerging markets, Lima has proved highly vulnerable to political
ups and downs. Just when foreign investors were starting to bring money in
early last year, attracted by a wave of reforming legislation which
transformed Peru into one of the world's least-regulated markets, President
Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution.
The stock market plunged into recession, the index declining steadily for
six months. Then September's surprise capture of the Shining Path guerrilla
chief and other high-ranking leaders dramatically reversed the trend. For
the past seven months, with only a slight hiccup when the economy minister
was changed, the index has soared.
Now, a year after the 'Fujicoup', formal democracy has been restored and
both the president and his radical economic reform programme appear more
secure than ever. Mr Fujimori's personal popularity exceeds 60 per cent, the
privatisation process is being accelerated and direct foreign investment,
particularly from Asia and Latin America, is getting under way.
Two specific factors are expected to bolster the bolsa this year and next.
First, the government's privatisation office has announced sales totalling
between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.4bn before year's end. In some, the
stock exchange will play an important role, as it did in the sell-off of six
smallish state companies last year.
The other element which will stimulate bolsa activity this year is the
start-up of new private pension funds, known as AFPs. Designed along the
lines of the successful Chilean model, Peruvian AFPs will begin operating in
June.
In the short-term, AFPs are expected to capture around Dollars 500m a year.
Of that, experts calculate that Dollars 120m will go into the stock market,
immediately boosting daily volumes by around 15 per cent.
Because of the size of the Lima bolsa, this could exert important upward
pressure on prices. Currently, almost 300 companies are quoted, but regular
trading is confined to about a dozen; there have been weeks when only two
stocks have accounted for one-third of all trading.
One headache for the investor picking a likely company is the unreliability
of balance sheets. Until 1991, hyperinflation played havoc with figures and
serious comparative studies are still impossible. 'You simply have to resort
to strategies like counting how many bags of cement or crates of beer
they're selling,' says one fund manager.
Lima's blue chip shares include the two main breweries, Backus and Johnston
and Compania Nacional de Cerveza (CNC); two cement companies; the large
privately-owned Banco de Credito and the Lima telephone company, CPT. The
state's holdings in CPT and the finance companies are due for sell-off later
this year and trading has been heavy.
In recent weeks, however, star performers have been mining shares. Minerals
account for half of Peru's annual exports but the over-valued Sol has kept
the sector badly depressed for the past two years. Now, with the prospect of
a 10 per cent devaluation on 1993 after a similar rate last year, investors
are looking seriously at mining shares again.
The government is claiming that the country's prolonged recession has now
bottomed out. GDP is set to rise between 3.5 and 5 per cent this year, with
inflation likely to stay under 50 per cent, low by Peruvian standards.

FOLLOWING the March 3 debut of First Peru Investment Company, a Dollars 25m
closed-end fund from the Bankers Trust stable, Latin American Securities in

'tremendous' opportunities now exist for investors in the Peruvian stock

FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Coats firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Textile group Coats Viyella firmed 4 to 241 1/2 p as at least two securities
houses decided that the shares offered a buying opportunity.
UBS was reiterating its buy stance on the stock and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken
published a buy recommendation. Mr Khaleeq Taimuri, Carr's textile
specialist, argued that the group's premium rating was well justified in the
light of its earnings potential, the recovery of the dollar and the
containment of losses in Brazil.
ICI hardened a penny to 1143p as the soon to be demerged company slapped a
gag on a large area of the market ahead of its impending Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue.
The group needs to raise the money for the creation of a separate
pharmaceuticals arm, Zeneca, and the rights issue is expected in June.
However, the market has been somewhat surprised at the breadth of the gag,
which extends to all its brokers whether they are core advisers or
subsidiaries, and whether they are involved in the UK or overseas areas of
the cash call. SG Warburg, BZW, Goldman Sachs and Hoare Govett are all being
banned from comment.
Concern that an area of Smith &amp; Nephew's US business would be hit affected
the stock, which closed 4 1/2 lower at 151p. US Surgical, which provides
equipment for keyhole surgery, had announced that it was shifting from
direct supplier to distributor and there were fears that Smith &amp; Nephew
would have to follow the same route. However, an analyst said Smith played a
very small part in keyhole surgery and 'marking down the shares was wholly
inappropriate'.
Reuters Holdings recovered 7 to 1337p after the news and electronic
information group announced a deal with its US subsidiary.
The first day of dealing in Holliday Chemical Holdings went very well
considering the desultory holiday atmosphere in the market. The new shares
began trading at 195p and were bought up to 213p, with 12m traded.
The utilities areas all suffered from profit-taking, with the water shares
especially vulnerable. Anglian declined 6 to 546p, Thames 7 to 556p, Severn
Trent 5 to 527p and North West 4 to 528p.
SG Warburg appreciated 9 to 649p, still boosted by the prospect of
substantial fee income for its participation in the BT III issue later this
year.
Mirror Group Newspapers approached their issue price, adding 4 at 121p,
following a positive results statement earlier in the week. The shares
received a further boost from a buy note from NatWest Securities. The house
likes the aggressive stance taken by the new editor and management team.
A positive statement from Carlton Communications ahead of a forthcoming
conference broadcasters meeting helped the shares recover from an oversold
position.
Carlton is very confident about its Quantel digital manipulation system,
which has been doing well, particularly in Japan. The stock ended 9 higher
at 747p.
BICC shares retreated sharply, closing 13 lower at 343p following heavy
turnover of 3.2m after James Capel, the agency stockbroker, was reported as
having downgraded the stock.
Housebuilders responded to recent surveys hinting at an upturn in sales in
recent weeks. George Wimpey rose 6 to 149p, Persimmon 6 to 244p and Wilson
Connolly 3 to 166p.

FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sun Alliance down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp reduction in losses at Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, to a
level very much in line with most market forecasts, failed to stem a
sustained bout of selling in the shares after analysts registered their
surprise at the level of property write-downs that were announced by the
group.
The write-downs were partly responsible for a substantial fall in the
company's solvency margin - net assets as a proportion of non-life premiums
 -from 69 per cent to 54 per cent and a decline from 286p to 280p in the net
asset value.
The solvency margin is expected to fall a further 4 percentage points to 50
per cent after the group completes its purchase of Hafnia's Danish
operations. One analyst said the drop in the solvency margin would 'impose a
severe limitation on the group's dividend prospects'.
Nevertheless, Mr Trevor May, a keen supporter of the shares, said he was
keeping the stock on the 'buy' list and shifting his current year forecast
from Pounds 115m to Pounds 128m. Mr Youssef Ziai, Morgan Stanley's insurance
specialist, forecast that for the shares to make progress Sun needs an
improvement in operating profits.
Mr John Russell of Hoare Govett increased his 1993 profits estimate to
Pounds 182m but warned that prospects for the dividend are very constrained.
Sun shares settled 5 off at 349p on turnover of 4.3m.

SPECULATION that Bass and Allied-Lyons are discussing a merger of their
off-licence businesses added spice to a quiet drinks sector.
Allied owns Victoria Wine, which has 960 outlets, and Bass the Augustus
Barnett chain of 583 shops. Together they would have a turnover of around
Pounds 120m, according to analysts. However, Allied said on Thursday that
although it was interested in the Bass business and preliminary talks had
taken place, there were no other imminent developments.
Analysts said that while the move would make commercial sense, the
arithmetic could be against a deal being struck. Bass was said to have put
Augustus Barnett in play 18 months ago with an asking price of around Pounds
60m. However, drinks specialists said a more realistic price might be nearer
Pounds 45m.
Whether Allied buys or merges with Augustus Barnett, it would create a
business to rival Whitbread's Thresher that has more than 1,600 outlets.
Barnett is thought to break even, while Victoria Wine is said to be only
marginally profitable. Both have been under growing pressure from the
expansion of the take-home trade at supermarkets.
Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said such a move would make
'commercial sense' and both companies would benefit from the economies of
scale and continuing supply of their own products.
Bass slipped a penny to 547p and Allied-Lyons 6 to 552p, while Whitbread
gained a penny at 457p.

FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sluggish trading ahead of the holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIRTUALLY unchanged reading on the FT-SE 100 Index provided a suitable
verdict on the trading session in the UK stock market on Thursday as
London-based securities houses balanced their dealing books ahead of the
extended Easter weekend. Although still nervous, equities were helped by
technical rallies in Wellcome and BAT Industries, the two blue chips whose
misfortunes have undermined the market this week, and the Footsie remained
comfortably above the 2,800 mark.
The final reading ahead of the Easter weekend showed the FT-SE 100 at
2,821.8, only 0.3 off from the previous day. But at worst, the Footsie
dipped 6.0 to 2,816.1 after failing to hold an early gain which reflected a
firm overnight performance on Wall Street. The new Wall Street session,
however, made a less promising start and was giving ground as the London
session died away after midday.
The London market lost nearly 50 points on the Footsie scale last week, with
leading indices hurt by setbacks in Wellcome, following adverse medical
review of its anti-Aids product, and in BAT Industries, hit by price-cutting
plans by Philip Morris, the US cigarette group.
There has been less pressure on the second line issues, however, and the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index steadied from early trading on Thursday to close 0.6
firmer at 3,084.3; over the week, the Mid 250 has shed only 24.2. Private
investors have been buyers of the Mid 250 stocks.
Equities made a cautious response to the report that Norwich Union, the
mutual insurance group, is considering reversing recent policy to switch
back from gilts to equities. Bonds, dull at first, ended  1/8 higher at the
short end and nearly  1/2 up at the long end.
Seaq volume in equities slipped to 451.5m shares from the 508.1m of the
previous session. Retail volume, which has continued to turn in high daily
totals since mid-September when sterling departed from the ERM network, was
worth Pounds 1.14bn on Wednesday. The high level of retail, or customer,
business has proved one of the more positive signs in an increasingly
lacklustre stock market.
Pharmaceuticals stocks put on a dull performance, with the rally in Wellcome
shares making little difference by the end of the session. Glaxo, which had
appeared to be attracting some switching out of Wellcome, failed to sustain
its recovery. The improvement in BAT Industries, a welcome rally after the
selling earlier in the week, had no implications for the rest of the market.

FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACTIVE day's dealing in the traded options market was in stark contrast
to a dull business in the futures, writes Christopher Price.
The total options volume was 41,902, with a chunky 12,389 being dealt in the
Euro-FT-SE option. Amstrad led the way in the stock options, with 6,451
contracts recorded. Lasmo was next on 2,158, with 1,000 November 140 puts
sold at 12p and 500 of the November 180 calls bought at 36p. Among the other
stocks, Asda reached 1,551 lots, Cable and Wireless 1,063 and BTR 1,015.
The June FT-SE 100 futures contract opened firmly on the back of a good
overnight performance from Wall Street. However, buyers quickly lost
interest and June drifted in mid-morning, hitting a low point of 2,826
around 11am.
Quiet trading ensued and the contract nestled in a 10-point trading range
for most of the afternoon, before a rally towards the end enlivened the
session. June finished at 2,831, up 3 points from its previous close and at
a 10-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 6,900.

FT  10 APR 93 / Money Markets: Speculation on UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY MARKET dealers went home for the Bank Holiday weekend on Thursday
mulling over the possibility of a another cut in UK base rates when they
return next week, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks, the UK Treasury and The Bank of England have issued very
strong indications that monetary policy is on hold for the time being. But
some dealers see another burst of speculation about a cut blossoming after
the Easter break.
One factor in favour of another cut is sterling's stronger performance on
the foreign exchanges. At the close of trading yesterday, the pound was back
above the 80 per cent level on the Bank of England's exchange rate index for
only the third time since January 25.
The index, which measures sterling's performance as a percentage of its 1985
value against a basket of currencies, is the UK chancellor's favourite way
of judging the currency's strength. Dealers are also wondering whether next
week's UK economic indicators will help to construct a case for another
easing. The retail price inflation figures, due out on Friday, are expected
to be on the low side. The industrial production and manufacturing output
figures due out on Wednesday should be positive - but not so strong that
they give the government much source of comfort.
All these factors may explain the slightly more bullish tone in sterling
futures markets yesterday. The June short sterling contract was up 5 basis
points at one stage, touching 94.28, before closing at 94.26.
Cash rates also remained very soft, with 3 month sterling deposit rates
closing unchanged at around 5 7/8 per cent. One factor easing sterling rates
was the ease with which a Pounds 2.05bn shortage forecast by the Bank was
reduced. The overnight rate was as low as 1.5 per cent at one stage.
The bullishness for sterling rates may have been underlined by the lack of
any gloom following the Bank of France's decision not to ease policy.
Contrary to the market's view, France left its intervention and 5-10 day
rates unchanged.
This caused a set-back for futures, with the June contract falling 8 basis
points to 91.75 immediately after the news, and closing at 91.76. But
3-month French cash remained very low at 9 1/8 per cent.

FT  10 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Budget rumours boost the yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued to weaken against the yen in both Asian and European
trading on Thursday, reaching another historic low against the Japanese
currency, writes James Blitz.
Strong speculation about the Japanese government's fiscal package to boost
the country's economy was the main factor driving the yen upwards.
In Thursday's Asian trading, the dollar dipped to another record low of
Y112.85. In Europe, the US currency later eased to a close of Y113.55.
The yen also showed the same power against a generally softer D-Mark,
reaching a four-year high in Asia at one stage. It weakened again to close
on Thursday night at Y71.84 from a previous Y70.38.
Boosting the Japanese currency was speculation that the government's new
fiscal package, due to be revealed on Tuesday, would be larger than
expected. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a package of
more than Y13,000bn to stimulate the economy.
According to Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, this is
the type of fiscal package that could underpin the next big move upwards in
the yen/dollar rate. 'I see no reason why the yen should not test Y105 to
the dollar in the weeks ahead,' he said.
The dollar also traded weakly against the D-Mark in Europe on Thursday. A
smaller than expected rise in US core inflation dashed speculation that the
Federal Reserve might lean towards tightening monetary policy later in the
year. US producer prices rose 0.4 per cent in March, but the core ex-food
and energy measure rose just 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of a 0.3 per
cent rise.
The US currency finished at DM1.6070 from a previous DM1.6155.
The D-Mark was generally weaker against most other European currencies. The
French franc briefly pierced the FFr3.38 level against the German currency
after the Bank of France surprised the market by deciding not to cut its
official interest rates. But the franc weakened again to close at FFr3.385
from a previous FFr3.384.
Thursday's keynote speech to the French parliament by Mr Edouard Balladur,
the new prime minister, also attracted some support for the franc - in
particular his suggestion that the Bank of France could become fully
independent within the next few months.
Sterling enjoyed another strong performance against the D-Mark. The pound
closed on Thursday night at DM2.4500 from a previous DM2.4475, and some
dealers expect that strong economic data next week might help the UK
currency up towards DM2.50.

FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Packer's raid raises Fairfax
takeover stakes - A look at the bid speculation surrounding the Australian
newspaper group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little more than a year after it was acquired by a consortium led by Mr
Conrad Black, the future of Australia's John Fairfax Holdings newspaper
group is once again in doubt following a stock market raid by Mr Kerry
Packer.
Fairfax shares jumped 4 cents to ADollars 2.02 on Thursday after Publishing
and Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Mr Packer's privately-owned Consolidated
Press Holdings (ConsPress), said it had bought a 5 per cent stake for
ADollars 75.6m (USDollars 53.2m).
The raid increased Mr Packer's Fairfax shareholding to more than 10 per
cent, prompting speculation the billionaire publisher was planning to fight
Mr Black for control.
If he is, it will not be much of a battle. ConsPress has both the cash and
the management skills to acquire Fairfax, while Mr Black's hold on the group
rests on the shaky foundation of a mere 15 per cent shareholding.
ConsPress has been scanning the market for takeover targets since early last
year, when Mr Al 'Chainsaw' Dunlap, Mr Packer's right hand man, completed a
restructuring which left the group debt free with assets of about ADollars
3bn.
Fairfax was always likely to be on the ConsPress shopping list, if only
because the Fairfax and Packer families spent decades fighting for control
of the Sydney newspaper market.
Fairfax is not the biggest newspaper group in Australia - that title belongs
to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - and its influence has dimmed since
it was plunged into receivership in 1990 by Mr Warwick Fairfax, its
29-year-old former proprietor,
However, the group remains one of Australia's most commercially attractive
media businesses. Its main titles, the Sydney Morning Herald and The
(Melbourne) Age, are lucrative generators of classified advertising revenue.
It also publishes the Australian Financial Review, a monopoly business
daily.
The first sign that Mr Packer might be looking seriously at Fairfax came in
February, when he announced that Mr Dunlap was to be replaced as ConsPress
managing director by Mr Brian Powers. Mr Powers, 43, was a partner in
Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank which owns 5 per cent of Fairfax
in the form of non-voting convertible debentures. He was a director of
Fairfax, although he has since resigned.
More importantly, Mr Powers was one of the two men who ran the successful
bid for Fairfax by Mr Black's Tourang consortium in 1991 (the other was Mr
Dan Colson, now deputy chairman of the Telegraph).
Tourang was originally structured to deliver a 20 per cent stake in Fairfax
to the Telegraph, and 15 per cent each to ConsPress and Hellman &amp; Friedman.
That structure collapsed in the face of political and regulatory opposition
which forced Mr Packer to withdraw and impose a 20 per cent ceiling on
foreign shareholdings.
As a result, the Telegraph was limited to 15 per cent, enough to deliver
management control of Fairfax, but not enough to keep it in the face of a
determined takeover attempt.
Mr Black has sought government permission to increase his stake to 25 per
cent, and Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister) is
likely to agree shortly, in spite of opposition from backbench MPs. But if
Mr Packer is serious about bidding for Fairfax, a small increase in the
Telegraph's shareholding will not be enough to keep ConsPress at bay.
Fortunately for Mr Black, Mr Packer has problems of his own.
Under Australia's cross-media ownership regulations, Mr Packer cannot
acquire more than 14.99 per cent of Fairfax unless he relinquishes control
of the Channel Nine television network, the top rating commercial station.
To comply with the law, he would have to reduce his 48 per cent stake in
Nine to less than 15 per cent, and convince the Australian Broadcasting
Authority (ABA), that he could not influence the network through other
shareholders or managers.
There has been speculation that Mr Packer might try to overcome this
provision by parking part of his Nine shareholding with his son Jamie, a
ConsPress manager, or with other friendly associates.
ABA officials say the law is tight enough to prevent such a strategy. So
would Mr Packer be prepared to sell Nine to facilitate a bid for Fairfax?
Analysts say he might.
Nine made a net profit of ADollars 60m last year, and is likely to benefit
more than its rivals from economic recovery. But profits may be harder to
generate when satellite television begins to eat into advertising revenue in
two years' time.
Mr Packer stands to make a substantial profit on his Nine shares, which are
worth about ADollars 300m at Thursday's market price of ADollars 2.97. He
paid ADollars 200m to purchase a slightly larger controlling stake from Mr
Alan Bond in 1990.
Against this background, Fairfax's forecast pre-tax profit of ADollars 105m
in the current year could look attractive. The group is worth ADollars
1.25bn at the current market valuation, well within Mr Packer's pocket.
However, Mr Packer may not have a full takeover in mind. One suggestion is
that he is simply pushing up the share price to maximise a compensation
payment due to ConsPress from its former partners in Tourang.
Under the agreement, Conspress will receive 30m times the difference between
ADollars 1 and the share price on December 31. At Thursday's price of
ADollars 2.02, the deal is worth ADollars 30.6m.
Alternatively, Mr Packer may simply wish to play a limited role in Fairfax,
while sending a subtle reminder to Mr Black that he has the capacity to take
control if he wishes.
Before pulling out of Tourang, Mr Packer told a parliamentary committee that
it would amuse him to hold a small stake in Fairfax.
Mr Black's fear must be that it would probably amuse him even more to take
control.

FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: US group to raise Dollars 1bn in
real estate sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been struggling with
serious problems in its financial services unit, has agreed to sell most of
this division's remaining real estate assets for about Dollars 1bn cash.
The assets are being sold to L. W. Real Estate Investments, a newly-formed
limited partnership, in which Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment
bank, will be the general partner.
Westinghouse will invest about Dollars 150m for a 49 per cent limited
partnership interest, while Lehman Brothers will contribute a similar amount
for its equity share of the partnership.
The aim is for the new partnership to offload the properties as quickly as
possible through securitisations 'and other accelerated sales and
disposition techniques'.
The assets are said to have a book value, before reserves, of Dollars 1.7bn,
and are being sold for about 52 per cent of their original book value.
The partnership will assume some off-balance sheet financing arrangements
related to the assets. Westinghouse shares rose Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 15
1/8 on Thursday.
Westinghouse said the Dollars 1bn consideration for the assets will exceed
the reserved value of the properties. Proceeds from the sale will be used by
the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate to pay down debt.
Westinghouse noted the latest disposal comes on top of Dollars 1.3bn-worth
of asset sales over the past six months - also at values which were in
excess of reserved levels.

FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Dow Jones income up at Dollars
30.9m for quarter

LOWER interest expenses and improved advertising revenue at the Wall Street
Journal helped Dow Jones, the newspaper's owner, post net income of Dollars
30.9m in the first quarter, up from Dollars 16.1m a year ago.
The comparable 1992 earnings, however, were affected by a restated one-off
net charge of Dollars 10.8m, taken because of changes in accounting for
taxes and employee post-retirement benefits. Excluding the special charge,
Dow Jones' first-quarter earnings this year were up 15 per cent on 1992.
Consolidated operating income for the first quarter rose 4.6 per cent to
Dollars 65.3m, on revenues of Dollars 463.4m.
Operating income from the company's business publications jumped 37.6 per
cent to Dollars 31.8m.
At the flagship Wall Street Journal, advertising lineage rose 5 per cent in
the January-to-March period.
Increased spending on technical product development, however, meant
operating income from the information services division, which includes the
Dow Jones/ Telerate electronic news service, fell 12.9 per cent to Dollars
34.5m.
Earnings were also lower at Ottaway Newspapers, Dow Jones' regional
community newspaper division, where income fell almost 6 per cent during the
quarter to Dollars 3.7m. The company said that income at a number of Ottaway
titles was hit by the big storm that struck large sections of the eastern US
in mid-March.

FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Thomson TV unit reduces loss to
FFr1.77bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Consumer Electronics yesterday confirmed that last year it cut its
net loss to FFr1.77bn (Dollars 328m) from FFr2.47bn in 1991, chiefly due to
cost and stock cutting.
The state-owned company, for which television sets account for more than
half of its business, said it suffered an operating loss of FFr330m last
year, against the FFr228m recorded in 1991. Turnover was static at
FFr30.55bn.
TCE, which has a heavy debt burden to shoulder, said yesterday that 'after
stemming the deterioration of results in 1992', it hoped to continue the
improvement this year.
TCE said it increased its share of the US television market by two
percentage points and of the US video-recorder market by four percentage
points, ranking first in both sectors. It added that it maintained its
market share in Europe in spite of a tough economic climate.
Thomson, the state holding company which controls TCE and Thomson-CSF, the
defence electronics company, also reported a net loss, of FFr544m for 1992,
against a FFr702m loss in the previous year.
Earlier this month, Thomson-CSF unveiled a drop in net profits to FFr1.5bn
for last year, compared with FFr2.34bn in 1991.

FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: La Generale cuts exposure to
industry sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, is taking rapid
steps to reduce its exposure to Europe's weak industrial economy.
On Thursday, La Generale unveiled a strong increase in profits before
extraordinary items in 1992 - to BFr6.1bn (Dollars 184.8m) from BFr4.5bn -
but said its results were still too heavily influenced by 'cycles of
industrial activity'.
The group pledged to lift its presence in 'the most promising sectors' of
activity. It also announced a complex deal which should remove all trace of
the Belgian group's 25 per cent stake in Arbed, the Luxembourg steelmaker,
from this year's consolidated profit, without cutting the investment itself.
Arbed accounts for only 2 per cent of the value of portfolio value, but
dragged down La Generale's profits by more than BFr1.4bn over the year as it
struggled in the deepest steelmaking recession for a decade.
At the same time, BFr2bn of extraordinary provisions at Union Miniere, the
82 per cent-owned metals group, all but wiped out the holding company's
extraordinary capital gains.
After extraordinary items, the holding company's net consolidated profits
slipped to BFr6.2bn last year from BFr7.6bn in 1991. The group is proposing
to maintain its gross dividend at BFr112 per share.
Compagnie de Suez, La Generale's majority shareholder, has made clear it
wants to reduce its industrial interests.
Viscount Etienne Davignon, the Belgian group's chairman, and Mr Gerard
Mestrallet, chief executive, said they were not simply abandoning industrial
investments in favour of the group's utilities, tourism, banking and
insurance holdings.
However, they confirmed they were talking to potential buyers of a minority
stake in Union Miniere, and that La Generale might consider increasing its
21 per cent stake in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, by buying
some of the shares owned by another associated company, Groupe AG, the
Belgian half of the Belgian-Dutch insurer Fortis.
Meanwhile, La Generale and the Luxembourg government, which owns nearly 41
per cent of Arbed, each intend to inject a 6 per cent stake in the
steelmaker into a new company, which could link up with an industrial
partner by 1995.
A simultaneous swap of voting and non-voting shares will enable La Generale
to reduce its voting stake to 15 per cent from 29 per cent and exclude the
Arbed investment from its consolidated profits in 1993.

CREDIT Suisse, a unit of CS Holding, said it was not worried by the
downgrading of its long-term debt by Moody's Investors Service and was sure
its long-term strategy would maintain the group's strength, Reuter reports
from Zurich.
The US credit rating agency said it had cut the long-term deposits and
guaranteed senior Eurodebt of Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse Financial
Products to Aa2 from Aa1.
It added that it had done so because the Volksbank takeover earlier this
year would have an adverse impact on the consolidated asset quality of the
CS Holding group.

FT  10 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Copper
takes a severe hammering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTERING which most base metal prices have taken from the recession
finally caught up with the copper market this week.
Prices showed signs of things to come on the London Metal Exchange on
Monday, when three-month copper fell below support at Dollars 2,155-Dollars
2,160 a tonne and touched five-week lows. But dealers were looking for fresh
support at Dollars 2,130, although they believed falls to Dollars 2,100 were
possible.
In the event, copper closed on Tuesday at Dollars 2,090 a tonne - a fall of
Dollars 52 a tonne on the day. Analysts blamed substantial selling from the
Far East and China for forcing the market down so sharply. The Chinese have
previously been in the market as buyers.
Mr Neil Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, said copper had been defying
economic gravity since the recession began, and had had the greatest
potential of all the base metals for decline. But every time the price
seemed under threat, an interruption to supplies or Chinese buying had come
to the rescue.
It appeared unlikely that rescue would be at hand this time, he suggested.
Stocks were rising, and there were no supply problems.
On Wednesday the rout in the copper market continued. In after hours trading
three-month metal fell below the psychologically important Dollars
2,000-a-tonne level. In three days the market had fallen Dollars 185 or 8.5
per cent.
On New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) the active May contract hit the
lowest level seen since the contract began trading in 1988 - 86.95 cents a
lb. 'It's technically oversold, but I don't see anybody wanting to step in
front of this,' a New York analyst told the Reuter news agency.
LME traders were expecting Wednesday to be volatile as options were
declared. In the event about 5,700 lots of 'put' options - equivalent to
more than 143,000 tonnes of copper - were exercised.
Although this was an unusually large number, Mr William Adams, analyst with
Rudolph Wolff, said it was 'in the price'. Brokers had seen the copper price
retreating from Dollars 2,400 at the beginning of the year and had acted to
manage the risk.
In the longer term, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London
futures brokers, it should be remembered that copper production will not be
reined in until prices fall below 70 cents a lb. He pointed out that Chilean
producers have a marginal cost around 35 cents a lb, and will continue to
expand production.
On Thursday LME copper remained volatile. Japanese buying in early trading
took the market up to Dollars 2,055 a tonne, but further Chinese sales
eroded the gains. It closed at Dollars 2,016 a tonne. Copper is still traded
in sterling on the LME. Cash copper closed on Thursday at Pounds 1,305.50 a
tonne, down Pounds 105.50 on the week.
Two studies of the aluminium industry warned on Monday of a lack of primary
aluminium smelters that will leave the supply-demand balance very tight by
1996, forcing prices up to high levels. Both suggested that a price of 75
cents a lb (USDollars 1,653 a tonne) was needed before the go-ahead for any
new smelters would be given.
Prices are very far from that level at the moment, and any tightness of
supply also seems a long way off in a week when LME warehouse stocks
advanced by 18,000 tonnes to a record 1,754,425 tonnes. Three-month
aluminium touched a new 16-month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne (51 cents a
lb) on Wednesday before edging back to Dollars 1,126. The three-month
aluminium price closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,140.50, down Dollars 6.75 on
the week.
Zinc and lead, however, have been supported by news of production cuts in
Canada and Mexico which analysts estimated would remove about 110,000 tonnes
of refined zinc and 74,000 tonnes of lead from the market this year.
Empresas Frisco of Mexico has suspended operations at its Real de Angeles
zinc-lead-silver mine and Curragh Resources has stopped producing
concentrates at its Faro mine in the Yukon. These follow recent reductions
by MIM, Pasminco, Cominco and Noranda.
Mr Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, suggested that lead had reached a
turning point after the recent decline. Cash lead closed on Thursday at
Pounds 282 a tonne, a rise of Pounds 8 on the week.
The cuts in lead and zinc production are also restricting the supply of
silver, which is often a by-product. 'The silver supply could be restricted
regardless of the price,' said Mr Eagles of GNI, pointing out that Peruvian
silver production fell by 11 per cent last year.
However, the silver price has slipped in the past week along with other
precious metals on the London bullion market. It closed on Thursday at 385
cents a troy ounce, down 9.5 cents.
Gold closed at Dollars 336.95 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.80 on the week,
as profit taking took its toll after last week's run-up. Platinum closed
Dollars 6.75 down on the week at Dollars 358.75.
Of the softs, sugar has proved the most interesting as New York raw sugar
has fallen back from its three-year highs. The May contract, which touched
12.52 cents a lb on Monday, retreated below 11 cents on Wednesday as the
funds and commission houses bailed out.
Fears of tight supplies appear to have disappeared this week, with the Cuban
harvest expected to come in near 6m tonnes. But the dominant factor in
ending the recent run has been the total lack of physical purchases at the
high prices, said Mr Eagles.
Next week London Fox is expected to announce major changes to its raw sugar
market. Its present contract traded just 1,399 lots last month.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: MTM in talks with SFO over shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the speciality chemicals company that saw its share price collapse last
year, has confirmed that it is co-operating with a Serious Fraud Office
investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shortfall in its 1991
profits.
The company said it was 'co-operating fully with the SFO and the North
Yorkshire police in an investigation being carried out concerning matters
relating to that shortfall.'
Mr Richard Lines, the founder and chairman of MTM, resigned from the company
in March last year after two profit warnings within the space of one week.
Soon after taking over as chief executive, Mr Ken Schofield said MTM had
forwarded a report by auditors Binder Hamlyn to the SFO.
The report revealed transactions that were 'incorrectly recorded' in 1991
and the previous year which had boosted sales and possibly profits, Mr
Schofield said.
After seeing the report the SFO had originally said it did not believe the
matter warranted its attention.
MTM was announcing a breakthrough in its refinancing arrangements. The
group's banks have agreed to convert Pounds 40m of its Pounds 100m debt into
80 per cent of the enlarged ordinary equity of the group at a price of 11p
per share.
The proposals would include provision of three years banking facilities to
MTM. MTM will announce a full refinancing proposal later this month.
MTM also warned that the first half of 1993 had been affected by continuing
financial pressures and difficult trading conditions.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Concern over domino effect from Lelliott
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of John Lelliott, one of the UK's largest privately-owned
construction groups, has raised fears about a domino effect on some of the
sub-contractors.
The Lelliott group owes about Pounds 36m to trade creditors, Pounds 7m to
Barclays Bank and another Pounds 1m in tax and wage bills, according to
preliminary estimates from the receivers.
Mrs Elisabeth Huxtable, general manager of the Confederation of Construction
Specialists, expressed shock at the size of the trade debt. The experience
of sub-contractors in this situation was that 'anything they are owed they
are likely to lose'.
Because of the level of payments retained by main contractors, she was
particularly concerned about sub-contractors, 'who are just about to
complete and who have not been getting paid'.
The confederation is lobbying for contract money to be held in trusts,
instead of being absorbed into the main contractor's account. 'If it were
put into a separate account with trust status, it would be safe if the main
contractor went under,' she said.
The John Lelliott group, based in Raynes Park, south-west London, suffered a
substantial drop in turnover from Pounds 240m in 1989/1990, when it produced
Pounds 5.8m profit, to about Pounds 126m last year, when it incurred a small
loss.
Its problem areas included the Point West project in west London, on which
it is believed to have lost Pounds 10m when the developer, Land &amp; Property
Trust, went into liquidation. Its own Stone Group subsidiary went into
receivership in February before being bought by Peter Cox Group.
Although the whole Lelliott group is insolvent, the administrative
receiverships announced on Thursday affect John Lelliott Construction and
eight other subsidiaries. Mr Malcolm London and Mr Christopher Hughes, from
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, have been appointed.
The bank could only call them into companies over which it had a floating
charge, and these account for the bulk of the group's Pounds 44m
liabilities. The bank ranks alongside other unsecured creditors.

Shares of Welpac, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler and
distributor, fell 8p to 30p on Thursday following a warning from the company
that it expected to incur a second half loss similar to the Pounds 684,000
reported for the first half.
And 'in the light of a changed pattern of business,' the profit and loss
account would be 'adversely affected by non-recurring write-offs of not more
than Pounds 1.1m' in respect of customer supply arrangements.
Management figures showed that the company had returned to profitability in
the current year. It was experiencing 'healthy orders, better margins and a
lower cost base.'
For the year to January 1992 Welpac swung from profits of Pounds 13,000 to
losses of Pounds 305,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlisle Group, the property services company, reported a reduced loss of
Pounds 946,945 pre-tax for the year to December 31.
The outcome, which came from reduced turnover of Pounds 5.15m (Pounds
6.03m), compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.16m in 1991.
Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman, said the result masked an improvement in the
second half. The group had countered recession by cutting overheads and
staffing. The waiving of contractual salary entitlements by directors and
the sale of investments also contributed.
Losses per share were 2.8p (3.2p).

<TEXT>
PITTENCRIEFF, the acquisitive natural resources and communications company
stalking USM concern Aberdeen Petroleum, is urging its target's shareholders
to 'participate in success' with its Pounds 7.7m all-paper bid.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, drew attention to Pittencrieff's track
record in the offer document published on Thursday.
'It has increased cash flow, earnings and net assets per share in each year
between 1988 and 1991 and dividends per share since payments began in 1990,'
the document read. Aberdeen, on the other hand, had an erratic earnings
record and had paid no dividends since its introduction to the USM in 1988.
Pittencrieff is offering two of its shares for every 49 of Aberdeen's. This
values shares at Aberdeen at 15p, against a close on Thursday of 15 3/4 p.
Pittencrieff closed steady at 368p.

<TEXT>
ROSS GROUP, the expanding consumer products and technical services company,
trebled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 3.68m in 1992.
The outcome included the first full-year contribution from Stellar, the car
alarm, battery charger and power supplies group acquired late in 1991, which
accounted for two thirds of the growth, said Mr Noel Hayes, chairman.
Some 66 per cent of profits came from consumer products and 34 per cent from
technical services.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 22.3m), with exports
accounting for about 12.6 per cent.
Net debt was Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 4.1m) at the year end. Gearing was reduced
to 44 per cent, compared with 500 per cent in 1989.
Earnings per share im-proved from 1.46p to 2.45p. A recommended final
dividend of 0.45p lifts the total to 0.65p (0.45p).

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Suter to sell industrial valves side for
Pounds 36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTER is to sell its industrial valves and component business for Pounds 36m
to enable it to pursue other areas of 'expansionary opportunity'.
The sale, which will wipe out Suter's borrowings, may be followed by an
acquisition.
Mr David Abell, chairman, has refused to comment on Suter's ambitions
towards James Wilkes, the engineer in which it has a 10.1 per cent stake.
Suter would only say the sale would give it 'additional flexibility to
develop its remaining core businesses and to pursue other areas of
expansionary opportunity'.
The valves business, which is being sold to a subsidiary of Tyco
Laboratories, made a trading profit of Pounds 4.1m before interest and tax
in 1992 on sales of Pounds 22.9m. Net assets were Pounds 10.3m.
The business is to be sold for an initial Pounds 34m cash. Another Pounds 2m
is payable in 1995. The final amount will be calculated as 20 per cent of
the amount by which the aggregate sales of the business for the following
two years exceeds Pounds 43m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the financially-troubled Irish aircraft leasing company, has
suffered a further downgrade in ratings by the Moody's agency.
About Dollars 1.8bn of debt has been downgraded to Caa from B1, which was
already in the speculative rather than investment grade.
Moody's said the change reflected the uncertain outcome of the company's
financial restructuring negotiations with aircraft manufacturers, lenders,
and shareholders. It was concerned that efforts to restructure GPA
financially could be jeopardised if shareholders failed to come up with
Dollars 200m in new equity, or if new shareholders were not found to fill
the gap.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Mortgage indemnity losses keep Sun Alliance
in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER LOSSES from domestic mortgage indemnity insurance left Sun Alliance,
one of the UK's largest insurers, in the red for the third consecutive year.
However, milder weather, premium rate increases and more selective
underwriting helped to reduce the pre-tax loss for 1992 to Pounds 129.6m.
The result was a marked improvement on the Pounds 466.2m deficit in 1991,
and prospects of a return to profit this year led the group to maintain its
final dividend at 9p for a same-again 14.25p total.
Even so the loss, coupled with the cost of the dividend and a Pounds 150m
write-down of property investments, further weakened the balance sheet. Net
assets fell to Pounds 1.55bn (Pounds 1.68bn) and solvency (net assets as a
percentage of non-life premium income) was reduced by 15 points to 54 per
cent. Solvency amounted to 129 per cent at the end of 1989.
Premium income from general business increased to Pounds 3.13bn (Pounds
2.68bn). Life premiums rose to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.02bn) while
underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 547.6m (Pounds 833.5m), mainly
because of a reduction in domestic mortgage indemnity (DMI) business losses
to Pounds 186.4m (Pounds 319.6m). The loss was partially offset by life
assurance profits of Pounds 62m (Pounds 54.3m) and investment income of
Pounds 356m (Pounds 313m).
Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, said he expected a 'further substantial
loss' from DMI in 1993, although repossessions and average claims costs were
falling - to Pounds 12,500 compared with Pounds 15,000.
DMI claims reserves had risen to Pounds 428m (Pounds 357m). Some Pounds 281m
(Pounds 262m) was earmarked for outstanding claims, with a further Pounds
147m (Pounds 95m) in unearned premium reserves. Last year Pounds 170m was
paid in claims, twice 1991's level.
Underwriting losses from commercial insurance increased to Pounds 248m
(Pounds 222m). The IRA bomb in the City last year left the group with net
losses of Pounds 39m. Liability business also incurred significant losses,
with reserves strengthened on employers' liability and professional
indemnity lines. Losses from marine business amounted to Pounds 74m (Pounds
50m).
Sun's Danish operation, which was expanded last week by the acquisition of
Hafnia, was profitable. The purchase will increase the business generated
from the Continent to 23 per cent, but it knocked another 4 points off
solvency.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dowding and Mills falls 40% to Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWDING AND Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, returned
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.77m for the half year ended December 31.
That was a downturn of 40 per cent on the corresponding period's Pounds
3.03m.
Turnover from continuing operations fell by more than Pounds 1m to Pounds
36.9m, but increased to Pounds 41.2m taking in the US acquisition last July
which contributed Pounds 4.2m.
The company has adopted the FRS 3 accounting rules with 1991 figures being
re-stated.
A Pounds 628,000 provision was made for the stake the company acquired
following an abortive bid for Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based
engineer, the value of which has since declined. A second provision of
Pounds 380,000 was made for the cost of some 80 redundancies.
The company said it had maintained operating margins at above 6 per cent in
spite of a 26 per cent fall in operating profits.
Interest payable rose to Pounds 421,000 (Pounds 382,000) reflecting a change
in the mix of funding and because the reduction in UK interest rates did not
coincide with the period being reported.
Gearing fell from 22.8 per cent to 19.7 per cent due to lower capital
spending and tight cash control, directors said.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.92p and is payable from
earnings per share of 0.61p compared with 1.29p.

FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Directors' pay doubled at Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group which made a retained loss of nearly
Pounds 60m last year, paid its directors twice as much as in 1991.
The increase in their remuneration from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4m last year
included a Pounds 490,000 bonus for Mr David Newton, chief executive,
bringing his total pay to Pounds 752,000.
The company said the bonus was for five years' 'performance related
services' in Canada, mainly working on Maple Leaf Foods.
He had been sent there for six months in 1987, when he was 'grossly
underpaid compared with Canadian counterparts.' He ended up staying until
1992, by which time profits had tripled - albeit from a low base - and
CDollars 380m (Pounds 199m) debt had been turned into CDollars 200m cash.
Mr Newton was one of three Hillsdown executives paid more than Pounds
300,000 last year whereas only one achieved that level in 1991. Six were
paid more than Pounds 255,000, compared with three the previous year.
Apart from higher levels of pay, the total bill was pushed up by greater
numbers on the board - 12 instead of nine.
It was a year of change. Sir Harry Solomon, co-founder and chairman,
devolved the chief executive role to Mr Newton and announced that Sir John
Nott, joint deputy chairman, would become executive chairman at the
forthcoming annual meeting on April 29.
There was also a change of finance director; and Mr Barry Legg, company
secretary, left the board - with a Pounds 200,000 severance payment - after
becoming Tory MP for Milton Keynes South West.
The management shake-up has accompanied a move to sell or close less
profitable parts of the group, shedding about 10 per cent of its Pounds
4.37bn turnover.
A Pounds 92.3m extraordinary provision was made in the 1992 results to cover
the reorganisation. Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 154.1m.

FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Defer to the text for proof of Duncan's saintliness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord MCCARTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Malcolm Rutherford asks (Arts: 'Macbeth with no scruples', April 3) why
English producers accept Duncan as 'someone close to sainthood'. He suggests
that it could be due to a 'curious act of national deference'.
What about a respect for Shakespeare's text? After all, Macbeth tells us:
'. . .this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off.'
One can only pity any actor who had to deliver these lines after a scene in
which the old King mimed 'a pass at Lady Macbeth' - as suggested by your
critic.

FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Subsidise the labour of the low paid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF BEACON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I understand Prof Snower's frustration in seeing the government
implement a job subsidy scheme which may destroy as many jobs as it creates
('Job subsidy pioneer hits at schemes', April 1).
However, the need to prevent substitution between subsidised and
non-subsidised jobs is clearly a difficulty with his proposals. Another
method is to subsidise the labour of the low-paid. This would boost demand
for low-paid labour without generating inflationary forces at the more
affluent end of the economy.
A convenient method for implementing such a scheme would be to raise the
nominal VAT rate and give each employer a subsidy for each worker employed.
This has the effect of subsidising goods and services that use a lot of
labour and taxing those that do not.
Using a simple model of the economy I estimate that reducing unemployment by
2m would imply net subsidies to the most labour intensive industries of
about 40 per cent of their value added and net taxes to the least labour
intensive enterprises (eg petrochemicals) of about 20 per cent. Average
prices do actually fall because savings on unemployment are fed into the
system.

FT  10 APR 93 / Fear of floating: 3i's bumpy road to a market listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a business with so much experience of bringing other companies to
market, Investors in Industry (3i) is having considerable difficulty
managing its own flotation. And for an organisation with a reputation for
sobriety verging on staidness, Britain's largest venture capital company has
given its plans to list a surprising air of drama.
The unexpected announcement on Thursday that 3i's shareholders had postponed
indefinitely plans for a float and that Alan Wheatley, chairman for just
nine months, was to resign, was the latest in a long line of setbacks.
The cancellation of the float brings back to the fore an implicit conflict
of interest between 3i and its shareholders - principally high street banks
and the Bank of England - in the provision of finance to small business.
The glacial progress towards the stock market has also ground down the
company's chairmen. When Sir John Cuckney, Mr Wheatley's predecessor, took
the helm five years ago it was assumed that he would steer the company to
the market. But bringing the banks into line proved more difficult than
expected, causing a frustrated Sir John to step down in 1992 to clear the
way for the final push. This was to be led by Mr Wheatley, a former senior
partner of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
Now he too has given up in frustration. Sources close to 3i's management
suspect the banks have become concerned at the ambitious expansion plans
being hatched by the 3i management and decided to delay any action. The
company was working on a plan to raise extra capital at the time of the
listing; a more aggressive 3i, willing to consider possible mergers with
other financial groups, was in prospect.
The difficulties of one company - admittedly a large one - coming to the
stock market might be of only passing interest but for 3i's crucial role as
a provider of equity and long-term loan finance to small and medium-sized
companies. It typically takes a minority stake in small businesses with
growth potential and provides financial resources. The ultimate aim is to
enable a stock market listing or to sell the holding to another investor.
Yet so long as 3i's managers are absorbed with the unresolved issue of the
flotation they will be diverted from their main task of helping small
companies to rebuild their balance sheets at a time when the recession is
showing signs of bottoming out.
3i no longer dominates the private equity market in the way it once did. But
with more than 4,000 companies in its portfolio, it is still a significant
player. Established in 1946 as the Industrial and Commercial Finance
Corporation with the backing of the Bank of England and the clearing banks,
3i was set up to help finance the postwar reconstruction of Britain.
For the next three decades 3i grew on the back of shrewd investments and a
near monopoly in this sector of the financial markets. It was not until the
late 1970s that competition began to stir. During the 1980s Britain
developed a vigorous and innovative venture-capital sector with more than
120 active players at its peak.
The story of 3i's move to a public listing goes back nearly 10 years when
several of the banks which are its shareholders started to look for ways of
selling their holdings in the company. 3i and its shareholders decided to go
for a public listing in the form of an investment trust, though at one stage
National Westminster Bank considered acquiring all of 3i's shares. Other
banks, notably Barclays, objected.
Investment trust status gives significant tax advantages but 3i became
embroiled in a lengthy wrangle with the Inland Revenue and it was not until
1990 that the company won official approval to go ahead with the flotation.
It was 3i's misfortune that just when the final obstacles to flotation were
removed the economy slipped into a prolonged recession. Before last
Thursday's indefinite postponement the flotation had already been twice
delayed in response to stock market conditions. Few observers foresaw the
depths of the recession though analysts do question how well 3i and its
shareholders responded to the economic climate in preparing for a market
listing. Even if the banks had been willing to push ahead 3i might not have
found the stock market willing to value its shares very highly.
'I am surprised they ever thought they would be able to float a venture
capital company at the end of a recession,' commented one analyst. 'The
small companies which 3i backs have been hardest hit and failure rates will
continue at a high level for some time to come.'
The company's approach to the market has been tinged with arrogance, some
analysts believe. The share prices of investment trusts specialising in
unquoted companies have recently traded at a substantial discount to the
value of their net assets. The discount for this sector has remained high
throughout the recession and is currently about 30 per cent.
'3i thought it could convince the market that it was different to the other
investment trusts specialising in unquoted equities and should trade on a
smaller discount. But the market didn't believe it,' one analyst said.
In any event, 3i's shareholders have now accepted that they cannot obtain an
adequate valuation of the company's assets. 'We believe we will get better
value if the flotation is deferred,' said a spokesman for National
Westminster, representing the bank shareholders. 'There is no pressure on us
to realise our investment. Since 3i is in a position to benefit from the
upswing we have decided to wait.' Midland, at one stage the bank under most
pressure to sell its stake in 3i because of problems with an ill-fated move
into the US, now has the backing of HSBC Holdings, parent of the powerful
Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation.
The repeated delays have caused analysts and 3i's rivals in the venture
capital market to question whether 3i ever will float. But the shareholders
insist it will. 'It is still seen as a key part of 3i's long-term
development,' NatWest said.
But 3i has not only consistently failed to meet its own flotation timetable,
it has also fallen out with some the companies in which it invests.
Concerned that a flotation would lead to a neglect of their interests a
small group of companies in the 3i portfolio last November set up a group to
make sure their voice was heard. Mr Barry Baldwin, chairman of the group,
welcomed the decision to delay the float.
But if many of the companies backed by 3i are happy with the latest twist,
morale within the group's high rise headquarters near London's Waterloo
Station is unlikely to have been improved. The repeated postponements and a
tough cost-cutting programme - in part recession induced - to prepare 3i for
the market have taken their toll. Staff numbers have been halved to about
550 over the past three years and several branch offices have been closed.
After 47 years as an unlisted company, sheltered from short-term performance
pressures, it was perhaps inevitable that 3i's move to the stock market
would arouse controversy. What could not be foreseen was that the company
and its shareholders would develop an unfortunate knack for making things
even more difficult for themselves.

   From M CALLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in your article titled 'Secretaries are undervalued'
(March 30). While I agree that this is the case, I have no objections to
managers making use of the new technology and secretaries doing research
etc.
Surely, however, each should be paid different rates for the proportion of
their time spent on the different tasks that they perform. The savings on
the proportion of the time that managers are paid at the rate of a
typist/secretary when doing basic tasks would enable the secretary's rate to
be increased for the proportion of her/his time that is spent doing research
etc.

FT  10 APR 93 / Once more up to the brink: Spain's Socialists meet today to
try and resolve a damaging split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez is an old hand at brinksmanship. The Spanish premier
resigned as leader of the Socialist party in 1979 when it refused to drop
Marxist doctrines. He later returned to acclaim. In 1986, he threatened to
resign as prime minister if Spain voted in a referendum against staying in
Nato. The tactic paid off.
Today, Mr Gonzalez, prime minister for nearly 11 years, may put the gambit
to another difficult test. A scandal over allegations that the Socialists
illegally funded their 1989 general election campaign has prompted a
damaging dispute between Mr Gonzalez and the party apparatus. The premier is
once again suggesting that he might be forced to resign from the party
leadership.
The party has been shaken by its poor showing in recent opinion polls. Mr
Gonzalez was invited to a secret meeting of moderate ministers and regional
party leaders last week to hear a series of complaints about the party
administration and the government's reluctance to stimulate economic
recovery.
As the party executive committee begins a crisis meeting in Madrid this
morning, its members are playing, in the words of El Pais, the country's
leading newspaper, 'not only with their credibility . . . but probably their
very existence'. If Mr Gonzalez goes - regarded as unlikely - the Socialists
face a heavy defeat in elections which must be held by the end of November.
If, instead, senior party officials resign, it could badly hurt the
organisation of the campaign. Either way, the Socialists' dominance of
Spanish politics may have been weakened in the past five days.
It has all happened very quickly. A month ago the Socialists were just
another governing party faltering in the polls ahead of an election. There
seemed plenty of time to recover. But it has been a long month. In a poll in
El Pais, support for the Socialists dropped to the same level as the
conservative Partido Popular, hopeless outsiders a few months ago. Official
statistics, meanwhile, showed that unemployment had risen to a record 3.04m
and the economy had fallen into recession.
Worse, tax inspectors confirmed two years of newspaper reports that senior
Socialists had run a group of bogus consulting companies through which they
received money from big business. The takings are believed to have helped
finance the 1989 election campaign. A few days later Mr Gonzalez was booed
at a university campus near Madrid.
Last weekend a Spanish news agency asked him if he planned to seek the
resignations of the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra, and its chief
administrator, Mr Jose Maria Benegas, over the financing scandal. They deny
any personal or party involvement in the affair. No, the prime minister
said. 'I have not even been tempted to try to personalise this except in
regard to myself . . . As a political leader my job is to take
responsibility.
'We will have to trust in the courts because people have a right to know
(the truth about the scandal). But I believe people want us to assume
political responsibility.'
Mr Gonzalez's comments set off a week of ferocious party infighting. He
appeared to imply that if someone did not own up to the scandal and resign,
then he might. The prospect worried the financial markets. The Bank of Spain
was forced to intervene to support the peseta.
Mr Benegas and Mr Guerra, left-wingers who are contemptuous of the prime
minister and his centrist cabinet, saw Mr Gonzalez's statements as a direct
threat to their power. Late last Monday, seeking to defend themselves, they
released a letter of resignation sent by Mr Benegas to Mr Gonzalez on April
1.
It did not mention the scandal. Instead, it was a strongly worded appeal for
support against what he and Mr Guerra, a former deputy prime minister,
believe is a conspiracy of moderate ministers to take control of the party.
Publication of the letter had the desired effect. The issue - political
responsibility for a possible crime - gave way to a call for party unity.
Battle lines formed between the party apparatus and the government's
moderates, including Mr Gonzalez.
If this is a mess, then Mr Gonzalez is largely to blame. He has ignored the
party for years to concentrate on economic management and foreign affairs.
Now he cannot even count on a majority on the executive committee.
Should he resign as party leader, he would remain as prime minister but
would not stand in the forthcoming election. Without him the Socialists
would probably lose heavily.
As a result, most political analysts doubt he will go. But resignations from
within the party will also be difficult to secure. The only departure that
would have much political effect is Mr Guerra's. But he is a professional
political administrator and determined to stay.
A possible solution is a fudge, in which an upright Socialist figure,
possibly the young Basque leader Ramon Jauregui, is asked to head a
committee of respected figures to 'oversee' the current party machine
through the elections.
A compromise solution, however, would resolve only the problem of party
unity and not the financing scandal facing the Socialists. This could become
even more damaging as newspapers leak further details of the allegations.
Such considerations could affect the timing of an election. Mr Gonzalez has
so far favoured waiting until the last moment - late November - in the hope
that the economy recovers. But he may be tempted to act more quickly. On
April 20 the prime minister is due to give his state of the nation address
to parliament and if the scandal is shoved aside in the interests of party
unity today he may use the occasion to call an early general election.
He will certainly be aware that the Socialists cannot afford another week
like this. For the first time in a decade it is they, and not the
conservatives, who are in disarray. Unless they can put their house in
order, they may find their electoral fortunes suffer the same devastating
reversal as their French counterparts.

FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Pension obligations of contractors after
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart ('Pensions blow to government contracting out plans,'
April 5) is right to stress the significance of the obligation on
contractors to offer comparable pensions when staff are transferred from the
public to the private sector.
The impact on contractors' costs are obvious. A few years ago a Treasury
document, Using Private Enterprise in Government, admitted: 'Most of the
savings from contracting out arise because contractors offer poorer
conditions of employment. . . The difference in total labour cost may
typically be of the order of 25 per cent. Pensions are the main element in
it.'
Two recent industrial tribunals signalled a change in the legal
interpretation of Transfer of Undertakings (Tupe) regulations in relation to
pensions.
Even in May 1992 the Treasury warned departments that, regardless of Tupe:
'Under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, the terms and
conditions of employment under the new employer must be broadly comparable
to those in the old. . .  This means that the pension scheme must offer
broadly comparable payments.'
However, the real lesson to be drawn is that ministers have allowed
ideology, not the law, to frame the approach taken with departments and
contractors, despite having had adequate legal advice from government
lawyers.
I hope the pathetic saga of ministers attempting to reinterpret the law in
relation to contracting-out will now end.

FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Classification problems must not hinder growth of
warehouse clubs in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL POYNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jim Lowe (Letters, April 1) sees the American warehouse club 'more as a
retail discounter than a wholesaler'.
The format's phenomenal success in the US - 600-plus outlets and about
Dollars 40bn of sales in just 10 years - has prompted increasingly heated
debate on how to classify the beast. It is a debate which, even before the
first UK outlet has opened, has already begun to rage over here.
One thing is clear - a supermarket it is not. Sixty-five per cent of the
clubs' sales are to business members and 35 per cent to group/individual
members. The clubs, which are closed to non-business members on weekday
mornings, sell 1,500 lines of food on 60,000 square feet compared to 10
times the range on half the space in a typical supermarket. The goods,
mainly in bulk packs, are offered with minimal service and in wholesale-type
environments to customers who spend, on average, Dollars 150 per trip.
Yet supermarket operators in the US have increasingly felt the clubs to be a
threat and it is evident that their British counterparts agree.
It would certainly be unfair to allow a retailer-in-disguise to trade from
'cheap' wholesale locations when British supermarket operators have to pay
such premiums for their sites. However, restricted-access distributors such
as Makro have been trading successfully in the UK for many years and all new
forms of fair competition should surely be welcome.
Whatever classification our planning authorities eventually decide to put on
the warehouse clubs, it would be a pity were the thrill of the purchase they
so popularly afford in the US to be denied to consumers in Britain.

FT  10 APR 93 / Blurred vision of a split personality: The worst may be over
for John Major, but he has yet to establish a distinct identity for his
administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a wretched year. Mr John Major's government has contrived to
heap bad judgment onto generous helpings of bad luck. It has left the prime
minister struggling to establish a sense of purpose for his administration.
The nation has been left to ponder whether he or his party have the will to
do so.
In fact the odds are that the worst is over. Mr Major may yet face the shock
of a defeat in next month's Newbury by-election. But beyond that a gentle
economic recovery should bring with it a modest upturn in the government's
fortunes.
For what it is worth in such febrile times, the consensus at Westminster is
that Mr Major will lead his party into the next general election; and he has
a good chance of winning it.
But no one, these days, is prepared to bet too much of their own money on
such predictions. The prime minister cannot rest easy until the Maastricht
treaty is ratified. If by some fluke the opposition parties and the
Conservative Euro-sceptics manage to overturn the natural pro-European
majority in the House of Commons then he will fall. For those who like
backing outsiders, the bar-room betting on that possibility among
Conservative MPs oscillates between five and 10-1.
The assumption, though, must be that Mr Major will govern for at least the
next three or four years. The question that must be then be answered is how.
Even in his own cabinet no one is quite sure. Some believe that the legacy
of the past year may drive the prime minister into another burst of
Thatcherite radicalism in an attempt to placate his party's right wing. The
Tory right has the welfare state firmly in its sights.
Others are convinced that once free of the snare of Maastricht he will
reassert the social market Conservatism with which he always intended to
replace the ideological passions of his predecessor. Others still, in
private moments, confess that they simply do not know. There is no agreed
route map.
His election victory on April 9 1992 promised to liberate the prime minister
from his party's past and stamp his own indentity on Conservatism. Instead
the 12 months since have shown us two John Majors.
The first remains the careful, shrewd, politicial tactician who outflanked
his more experienced rivals to steal the succession to Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. It is a persona still visible to those around him: in his clarity
of thought at cabinet meetings; in careful judgements of the mood of the
party; in an instinctive preference for pragmatism over theology.
At least one of his most senior colleagues is convinced that Mr Major was
the only leader capable of holding together the Tory party during the past
year. Under anyone else the European issue would have split the
Conservatives for a generation.
Other colleagues remind his critics that it was Mr Major's preference for
consensus over confrontation that won an election which his predecessor
almost certainly would have lost.
It is this side that persuades the prime minister that he will survive.
There has been the odd moment during the past year when he has suggested
that he would not be hard pressed to build a life outside politics.
If he had lost a crucial Maastricht vote last autumn he probably would have
quit. Yet far more frequent have been the private occasions when he has
lifted his horizon above not just his immediate problems but also the next
general election to speculate on the shape of a Majorite Britain in 2000. He
intends to stay.
Here though we come to the second John Major. This politician has appeared
an uncertain leader, hamstrung by a small parliamentary majority. His
pragmatism and a tactical rather than a strategic focus have left him too
often looking weak and insecure. This prime minister has yet to find a
rhetoric, still less a more solid framework, for the brand of Conservatism
he sold to the electorate only a year ago.
The trauma of sterling's exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the
depth of the recession, the civil war over Europe, and the coal industry
debacle, have left him subject to sharp swings in mood.
At one moment the Conservative Euro-sceptics are reviled and threatened. The
next they are courted, assured that Maastricht is an obstacle to European
integration.
The prime minister promises to build an industrial strategy to replace the
ideological indifference to manufacturing of the 1980s. Then, accused of
ditching Thatcherism, he protests the change is one of style rather than
substance.
There have been many occasions when the first Mr Major appears determined to
lead. But too frequently there have been others when he has preferred
appeasement.
So enthusiasm for the consensualism with which he replaced the blinding
conviction of his predecessor has given way to doubts about whether he can
set his policies within a long-term strategy.
Mr Major blames bad luck. Who foresaw the slide into world recession? Who
predicted the No vote in the Danish referendum on Maastricht? Who guessed
that the ERM could be so badly fractured by the speculators?
But in politics bad luck and poor judgment are impossible to disentangle.
Voters rarely distinguish between them. It was the prime minister who
decided first to make the ERM the core of his economic strategy. He
negotiated Maastricht. Who else can be blamed for the appalling state of the
public finances and the broken pledge not to raise taxes?
The cabinet must accept collective responsibility. There are notable
exceptions - Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo
among them. But too often other senior ministers have looked exhausted and
bewildered. Too many of them are politicians whose ambition to reach the top
has long taken precedence over a coherent philosophy for government. When
Mrs Thatcher took the decisions there was no need for others to dabble in
the world of ideas. There is now.
After the pain of the past few years the electorate will demand more than a
gentle economic recovery. The prime minister needs to find a tune to which
the country can whistle.
He has policies. Sometimes it seems too many - for education and training,
for standards in public services, for privatisation, for the promotion of
individual responsibility and ownership, for local authorities and, perhaps,
for manufacturing industry.
It is possible (not certain) that a credible medium-term economic policy
will emerge eventually from the ashes of the ERM. It can be argued that if
and when Maastricht is ratified, the less-ambitious mood in the rest of
Europe will restore to Britain a voice in shaping its future. But beads need
a thread.
The risk is that Mr Major will remain a prisoner of his small parliamentary
majority. He may steer too far in the direction of the Euro-sceptics. He
could be driven to mount the assault on the welfare state that his
predecessor never dared. Events rather than its own sense of purpose would
then remain the guiding force of his government.
To avoid the trap Mr Major must establish the personal political presence -
at Westminster and in the country - which has so far eluded him. It may well
be that the age of heroism in British politics has long since passed.
Margaret Thatcher was the exception rather than the rule. James Callaghan,
Edward Heath, Harold Wilson and Harold Macmillan are more appropriate
yardsticks against which to judge the present prime minister. But in their
different ways all of those leaders managed to imprint on the nation's
consciousness a distinct political identity. Mr Major must do the same.

FT  10 APR 93 / An older, wiser Mickey Mouse: After a year of losses, Euro
Disney realises that its customers want a theme park with a genuine American
flavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not take long for Euro Disney to realise one could go broke
overestimating the taste of the European public.
When the theme park outside Paris was being built, Euro Disney believed
visitors would want sit-down meals and souvenir sweatshirts with discreet
logos of Mickey Mouse. Instead they wanted take-away food and Mickey Mouse
logos big enough to cover their chests.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, the Frenchman who was appointed Euro Disney
chairman last January, says: 'Each time we tried to Europeanise the product
we found it didn't work. Europeans want America and they want Disney,
whether French intellectuals like it or not.'
When Euro Disney celebrates its first anniversary on Easter Monday, it will
look back on a year in which knowing what customers wanted proved more
difficult than predicted.
The company, which expected a profitable start, made a pre-tax loss of
FFr339m (Pounds 42.5m) in the year to September 30 1992, which included its
first six months of full operation. In the first quarter of the current
year, it recorded a deficit of FFr492m.
High French interest rates have made Euro Disney's FFr18bn debt more onerous
than expected. Inflation, the salvation of many an indebted developer, is
currently running at only 2.1 per cent in France, compared with the 5 per
cent Euro Disney projected. Occupancy at the park's six hotels has averaged
55 per cent, compared with an expected 68 per cent. One of its hotels had to
be closed for most of the winter. Spending on both food and merchandise is
lower than expected.
Although it has learned from some of its initial mistakes, profitability is
still years away. Just when the theme park begins to turn a profit will be
influenced as much by Euro Disney's efforts to ease its financial burden as
by management initiatives to improve its operations.
Mr John Forsgren, finance director, says the company will not make a profit
either this year or next. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure
analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects the group to record a deficit
of FFr769m this year and to produce losses of FFr570m in 1994 and FFr352m in
1995. She does not expect Euro Disney to make a profit until 1996.
Not all is gloom, however. In the spring sunshine, there are long queues for
the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Star Tours intergalactic voyage. Mr
Steve Burke, executive vice president, says the company will meet its
first-year target of 11m visitors by the end of this month. After a
disappointing start, Euro Disney had been expected to miss its target by
500,000.
The improved attendance figures are the result of an intense focus on the
French market. Initial visitor figures from the UK and Germany exceeded
expectations, but French attendances were disappointing, despite the
specially built RER suburban railway extension linking the park with central
Paris. In the first four months, Euro Disney attracted more British visitors
than French.
Mr Bourguignon puts the initial lack of French interest down to 'the Eiffel
tower syndrome'. People do not have a sense of urgency about visiting an
attraction in their own back yard, he says.
To boost attendances, Euro Disney offered residents of the Paris area
discounts of up to 30 per cent on the FFr225 admission price during the
first three months of this year. Giving local people discounts, known as
'resident salute', is a feature of Disney's US parks. Euro Disney also sent
sales teams to French schools and companies, offering reduced group rates
during off-peak periods.
The result was that French visitors accounted for over 35 per cent of the
total for the year, compared with 29 per cent in the first six months.
British visitors made up 15 per cent of the total for the year, with Germans
a short distance behind. Mr Bourguignon estimates that one-sixth of the 12m
residents of the greater Paris region have now visited the park.
Euro Disney has paid a price for the improved attendances, however. Mr
Forsgren says that about half the visitors to the park since January have
paid reduced entrance fees. Local visitors also spend less in the park than
those coming from further afield.
Mr Bourguignon says the Parisian weather has not been the problem many of
Euro Disney's detractors predicted. The park was full over the Christmas
period when temperatures were below freezing. Nevertheless, he says,
seasonal variation has been much sharper than anticipated, with attendances
particularly low on weekdays when schools are in session. To encourage
visitors during these quiet periods, Euro Disney is to offer winter
admission prices 30 per cent cheaper than in summer.
Euro Disney executives say they now have a clearer idea of what visitors
want. Apart from more take-away food and fewer sit-down restaurants, they
prefer Disney-branded souvenirs to general merchandise. They also want
cheaper meals and souvenirs. Children want more opportunities to shake hands
with Disney characters, who are even more popular in Europe than in the US.
But if they prefer American products, visitors to the park still display
European behaviour patterns. Mr Burke says that while Americans will eat
lunch at 11.30 am or 3 pm, Europeans insist on eating between noon and 2 pm,
creating long queues at the restaurants. To try to persuade them to eat
earlier, Euro Disney now has a morning parade in addition to the two later
in the day. Mr Burke says if a parade ends at 11.30, people are more likely
to eat before they do anything else.
Euro Disney executives say even the way Europeans travel to the park is
different from in the US. There are fewer cars than expected at Euro Disney
and many more coaches. The company originally built a recreation room for 30
coach drivers. One day last year, there were 900 coaches in the car park.
The company is now building a new cafeteria and recreation room for 700
drivers.
While the 12,000 'cast members' seem more assured and competent than a year
ago, they also seem more European than American. Two Euro Disney staff could
be found telling visitors to the park last month that Sleeping Beauty's
Castle was closed because of overcrowding. When will it be open? 'We don't
know,' they shrugged, with that time-honoured European insouciance which
suggests that not knowing is one of the perks of the job.
Mr Bourguignon says he is pleased with the cast members' 'enthusiasm and
creativity', and that first-year staff turnover of 34 per cent was below the
tourist industry average. Nevertheless, he says, the company wants greater
flexibility in deploying employees, particularly during quieter seasons.
He says he wants to encourage staff to take holidays in November and
January, when business is slackest. He also wants them to work in different
parts of the park during the day. Catering staff might work in the park
during the afternoon and at the hotels in the evening. Mr Bourguignon wants
to increase the company's pool of part-time workers, taking advantage of
recent changes in French labour law which have made hiring part-timers less
expensive.
Mr Forsgren says Euro Disney hopes to make savings in its second year by
using fewer staff this summer than last. 'We intentionally overstaffed last
year, particularly in areas such as security, because we had no idea what to
expect,' he says.
The company will retain its minimum team of around 10,000 employees for the
low season but will reduce the number of people employed in the summer high
season from last year's peak of 19,000 to between 15,000 and 16,000.
France's new conservative government is committed to reducing interest
rates, which should help Euro Disney. Mr Forsgren says the company is trying
to renegotiate the terms of its debt. 'Our objective is clearly to reduce
the interest burden. There are a number of different strategies under
consideration but we haven't taken any decisions yet,' he says.
The group repays FFr9.5bn of its debt at floating interest rates and the
remaining FFr8.5bn at fixed rates. It initially expected to repay the
floating FFr9.5bn at 9 per cent, but has had to pay an average rate of 2
percentage points more, adding FFr200m to its annual interest bill.
Lower French inflation has made it difficult for the company to raise
prices, particularly at a time when the French franc is relatively strong
against other currencies. Mr Forsgren estimates that lower inflation has
cost the company about FFr100m.
Euro Disney originally hoped to reduce its debt by raising capital from the
sale and lease-back of five of its six hotels and developing property around
the park. But both schemes have been scuppered by the sluggish economic
environment. The property development plan, expected to provide FFr100m in
capital gains last year and FFr200m this year, is on ice until Paris
property prices recover. The hotel programme, scheduled to start next year,
has been postponed because of the weak condition of the European leisure
market.
On the operating side, one of the biggest challenges is to persuade more
non-Parisian visitors to stay in on-site hotels. The problem is that, in
contrast with the group's Florida park, Euro Disney is too small to warrant
a stay of more than two days. The company is opening six new attractions,
including Le Temple du Peril, a train which takes visitors on 'a thrilling
high-speed chase through an archaeological dig in a dense rain forest', and
Legends of the Wild West, featuring 'a native American Indian who will help
transport guests back in time to the days of the American Wild West'. But
plans to open a second theme park, which would give visitors a reason to
extend their stay to several days, have been put back a year to 1996.
Mr Bourguignon says he would like to see more visitors using the Euro Disney
hotels as a base for exploring Paris. The only reason that has not happened
yet, he says, is that the Paris tourist industry has been depressed and
hotel rooms in the city have been easy to find.
He adds that Euro Disney needs to persuade its customers that the hotels,
each with their own theme, are an important part of a visit to the park.
There is, for example, the Hotel New York, built to resemble the Manhattan
skyline, the Sequoia Lodge, designed to evoke images of US national parks,
and the Cheyenne, intended to convey the feeling of a Wild West frontier
town.
Mr Bourguignon says: 'We probably haven't emphasised the whole experience
sufficiently. The Cheyenne is not just a sleeping box - it's an experience.'
During one guest's recent stay at the New Mexico-style Hotel Santa Fe, there
was no shampoo in the bathroom, the handle of the minibar came away in the
hand (as did the controls of the shower), a previous occupant's drinking
straw lay on the carpet, and a defective telephone resulted in a red
'message waiting' light flashing throughout the night.
The park is spotless and in good working order. The hotel 'experience' - so
important to Euro Disney's success - might need some upgrading.

FT  10 APR 93 / Leading Article: Homes versus enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE British personal sector about to change the habits of a lifetime in
the way that it saves and invests?
For the best part of half a century, privately owned housing and collective
forms of investment such as occupational pensions have claimed a
disproportionate share of the asset side of the household balance sheet. Yet
suddenly there are signs of a change. Last year, as house prices continued
to fall in nominal terms, private individuals ceased to be net sellers of
company securities and emerged as buyers of Pounds 4.7bn-worth of shares. If
the trend were sustained, it would amount to nothing less than a financial
revolution.
At first sight, it may seem perverse to raise the possibility of a shift in
deeply entrenched behaviour just when demoralised home owners are seeing the
first tentative evidence that the housing market is beginning to stir. But
one month's figures from the building societies, which is all the evidence
amounts to, hardly count for much.
While the ratio of house prices to earnings is below its average level of
the past 25 years, it is still well above the level in earlier troughs in
1970, 1977 and 1982. After the biggest of all the post-war housing booms and
busts, it would be surprising if the trough turned out to be shallower than
in earlier downturns, especially when the fall in nominal prices has been so
severe that the speculative investment premium in house prices may well be
disappearing.
New incentives
Moreover, the pattern of previous troughs has been for the price-earnings
ratio to remain broadly stable for two or three years once the bottom of the
cycle has been reached, as a backlog of transactions works its way through
the market. House prices could thus bump their way along the bottom for two
or three years, once again, before turning up. And by the second half of the
1990s, demographic factors will probably militate against a big upturn.
The more substantial arguments for believing that the rules of the game have
changed rest on a new and different pattern of incentives. The tax system
has long favoured investment in collective savings vehicles and in home
ownership. But the fiscal carrots are getting leaner by the year.
On the investment side of the equation, life assurance premium relief is
long gone. Since Mr Lamont's latest Budget, the fiscal reliefs for pension
fund investment are under attack, on an arbitrary basis that leaves pension
funds vulnerable to further imposts in future. Yet private investors now
have a powerful incentive to invest in the stock market directly via
personal equity plans.
Mortgage relief
In housing, the exemption from capital gains tax remains an important fiscal
privilege. Yet the value of mortgage tax relief has been reduced in
successive budgets and further eroded by inflation. The shrinkage in the
private rented sector over a period of several decades means that the
alternatives to home ownership remain inadequate. But this is a nettle which
the government will one day have to grasp.
It is, however, too soon to declare that the 1990s will be the decade of the
private equity investor, not least because of the costly impact of the
Budget's Advance Corporation Tax measures on higher rate tax payers.
But the market is undeniably becoming less institutional, with pension fund
cash flow falling from Pounds 16bn in 1990 to a mere Pounds 4.4bn last year,
reflecting a combination of contribution holidays and the increasing volume
of pensions in payment. As in the US over the past two years, private
investors may also be tempted to continue investing in expensive-looking
equities because they incur an income penalty by putting money into building
society deposits, rather than equities or gilts.
Thus far, it looks less like a revolution than a slightly haphazard set of
steps in broadly the right direction. The definitive verdict on whether
enterprise is to enjoy larger rewards than home ownership in Britain will
hinge above all on the course of monetary policy between now and the next
general election.

FT  10 APR 93 / Leading Article: Old wine in new bottles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW French government's policy statement, presented by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, to parliament on Thursday, was intended to
herald an era of 'reform and renewal' after years of Socialist
mismanagement. Yet the economic policies announced by Mr Balladur, apart
from a privatisation programme, are not very different from those of his
Socialist predecessor.
That, after the electorate's clear vote in favour of change, is the most
significant feature of the current French situation. The political consensus
on close links with Germany within a European Monetary Union is now so
complete that a new government has little flexibility in its choice of
economic policies.
Mr Balladur's declaration that the preservation of the current parity
between the franc and the D-Mark, the so-called franc fort policy, remains
an absolute priority, is tantamount to an admission that the Bundesbank
holds the key to France's economic prosperity in the coming months.
Economic recovery in France, which is expected to experience negative growth
this year, is dependent on lower French interest rates. Given the franc fort
policy, that will be allowed to happen only if the Bundesbank leads the way
more decisively than it has done so far in reducing interest rates. Nor can
a substantial fall in the exceptionally high level of unemployment, now
exceeding 3m, or 10.6 per cent of the active population, be expected until
such a recovery takes place.
Paris-Bonn co-operation
It is clearly with an eye to future Franco-German co-operation within Emu
that the prime minister announced plans to make the Bank of France more
independent, though the extent of that independence remains unclear. In
France, the governorship of the central bank is traditionally held by former
treasury officials, so the government's grip on the bank's policies will
certainly remain greater than that of the Bonn government over the
Bundesbank.
Mr Balladur, however, hopes that, once both central banks are able to talk
to each other as independent equals, the Bank of France will have a much
greater influence on German interest rates than it has now. That is by no
means a forgone conclusion. The Bundesbank's stubborness in defending purely
German interests should not be underestimated, as its recent interest rate
policy has demonstrated only too clearly.
In spite of his generally moderate and conciliatory tone, Mr Balladur
fiercely defended France's national interests in the Gatt trade
negotiations, particularly in the agricultural field. Stressing that France
had no intention of losing its place as the world's second largest exporter
of farm products, the prime minister demanded that agricultural problems
should not be singled out from other issues in the talks.
Uruguay Round
His emphasis on the harm that had been done to French agriculture by the
reform of the European Community's common farm policy and on the further
damage that the Gatt talks could cause, do not appear to bode well for
either the Uruguay Round or relations between France and some other EC
members, such as Britain. Yet it was significant that he stopped short of
demanding a renegotiation of the CAP, calling merely for adequate
compensation for farmers in return for price cuts. The widely forecast clash
within the EC on this problem may thus still be avoided.
Mr Balladur was given a standing ovation by the conservative-dominated
parliament, in spite of his Churchillian warning that it would take five
years of blood, sweat and tears to put France back on its feet. But the
government's problem is that the electoral calendar to which it has to work
does not give it that long. The next presidential election is only two years
away. Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader and presidential candidate, for
one, will want to see results much earlier to boost his prospects.
If the Bundesbank does not come to the rescue fairly soon, the political
pressures to abandon the central plank of Mr Balladur's economic policy, the
franc fort, and to go for growth might thus become irresistible. It is
within the next five months, rather than the next five years, that the die
will be cast.

FT  10 APR 93 / Anglo-Scots pipeline is mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, may study the
feasibility of building a privately funded pipeline to carry water from
southern Scotland and northern England to the drought-prone south of
England.
The pipeline, which would involve a 140-mile tunnel through the Pennines,
might cost Pounds 1.5bn. The idea has run into opposition, as the Scottish
Office considers privatising the water industry .
Scottish Enterprise may contribute Pounds 500,000 to a two-year project
study. Consulting engineer Mott MacDonald is understood to be interested, as
is Bank of America.
The scheme would take water from the rivers Nith, Dee and Annan in Scotland,
gather water from the rivers Eden and Esk in north-west England before going
to Kielder reservoir in Northumbria. The pipeline would then go by tunnel to
Carsington, where it would link with the water supply system for East Anglia
and south-east England.

FT  10 APR 93 / Union warns Mercury of anger over redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Communications Union has accused Mercury Communications, the
Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, of failing to carry out compulsory redundancies
properly.
The union has warned Mercury that it could face industrial tribunal cases
from former employees.
The union, which is not recognised by the company, has written to Mr Robert
Johnston, Mercury's personnel director, alleging that the company has not
looked for suitable alternative jobs for all employees who face redundancy.
The union also says that consultation procedures are inadequate and the
selection criteria for redundancy are sometimes vague.
About 50 employees out of the workforce of about 9,000 were made redundant
last year, following a reorganisation.
The union says there could be as many as 200 further compulsory redundancies
as the result of an efficiency drive.
Mr Johnston dismissed the figure as 'scaremongering' and said almost all of
the 200 were likely to be redeployed because there were also currently more
than 700 vacancies in the company.
It was expected the workforce would grow by about 1,000 in the current
financial year, Mr Johnston said.
A redundancy policy had been formalised during the past year and staff had
been fully consulted, he added.
One or two of the redundancies might not have been handled as well as he
would have liked and some staff could have 'left feeling bitter about their
experience'.
The union, which has the bulk of its membership in British
Telecommunications, says it has just under 700 members at Mercury. Mr
Johnston said the company preferred 'to deal with individuals as
individuals' rather than through a union.

FT  10 APR 93 / BR lobbies against strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL launched a campaign among its employees at the weekend to
persuade them not to join a second 24-hour strike on Friday.
Managers at depots and stations across the country have been told to talk to
staff and explain that there could be further job losses and dwindling
business for the railway industry if disruption continued. On April 2 BR
lost about Pounds 10m in gross revenue because of industrial action.
BR's move follows Thursday's breakdown of peace talks between management and
the two rail unions, RMT and the drivers' union Aslef. The gap between the
sides appears wide. RMT wants BR to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and
no use of contract labour, while Aslef is demanding that BR should not
change national agreements covering the deployment of drivers.
BR said yesterday: 'We understand the fears which stem from the coming
privatisation of the industry but no employer can guarantee jobs for life.'
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, believes BR 'went a
long way on Thursday to meet the demands from the unions'.
In a document presented to the unions BR reaffirmed that it would 'seek to
achieve any necessary manpower reductions by voluntary severance coupled
with natural wastage and arrangements for redeployment and retraining'. It
had also promised to 'discuss such arrangements with the unions and staff
representatives at the appropriate level'.
BR assured the unions that it would 'consult on any proposals for job
reductions and contracting out in accordance with established procedures and
take measures to avoid compulsory redundancies through the application of
current agreements'.
These offers did not satisfy the executive committees of the two unions but
further talks before Friday's planned strike cannot be ruled out.
BR remains reluctant to adopt a tougher stance for fear of a complete
shutdown of the network. BR's legal advisers suggest it would fail to secure
an injunction against the promised strike, which they accept is lawful.
A lock-out would precipitate legal redress from BR's freight contractors,
while depriving the unions of the check-off system for paying union dues
could not be achieved overnight and would do nothing to resolve the dispute.
Separately, London bus crews will not be striking on Friday. Instead, their
local representatives meet on April 22 to discuss further industrial action,
including another two one-day strikes, a lobby of Parliament in May, and a
public petition against plans to privatise and deregulate London's bus
services.
Members of the National Union of Mineworkers have been called on to strike
next Friday in the campaign against pit closures.
Late on Thursday night Mrs Anne Scargill, the wife of the NUM president,
started an underground sit-in with three other women at Parkside colliery on
Mersey side, one of the pits facing imminent closure.

FT  10 APR 93 / Directors size up new rules: Company compliance with the
Cadbury code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE INK has barely dried on the final version of the Cadbury rules
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the definitive rulebook on good corporate governance - and already
corporations are keen to show their compliance.
From June 30 every company whose shares are traded on the London Stock
Exchange will be required, as a condition of listing, to disclose in its
annual report the extent to which it complies with the code drawn up by the
Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, which bears the
name of its chairman, Sir Adrian Cadbury.
The committee has made 19 recommendations intended to improve the
functioning of corporate boards of directors. Although company annual
reports for 1993 will most reflect the changes required, some companies are
already expressing in their 1992 accounts their intention to follow best
practice.
Ms Gina Cole, secretary to the committee, said: 'If there is mass
non-compliance, the government may wish to step in.' She said the committee
would have to look behind published statements to see whether companies
really were complying with the code.
Not surprisingly, one company which has stated its good intentions is
Cadbury Schweppes, the company of which Sir Adrian was chairman. It says in
its 1992 annual report: 'The company complies with 17 of the 19 items of the
code.'
It says it will consider compliance with items covering the effectiveness of
a company's systems of internal controls, and with directors reporting that
a business is a going concern 'when guidelines for those two items have been
developed'.
The annual report also describes the roles of the audit, remuneration and
nominations committees, all of which are chaired - as recommended by the
Cadbury committee - by a non-executive director.
Also making reference to best corporate governance practice is M&amp;G Group,
the UK's largest unit trust manager. M&amp;G, as an institutional shareholder,
has taken a vigorous line on corporate governance matters and its chief
executive, Mr Paddy Linaker, had urged the Cadbury committee to take a
tougher stance on some issues than it did.
M&amp;G's 1992 accounts spell out the composition of the audit, remuneration and
executive committees and their reporting functions and say that executive
directors are employed under one-year rolling contracts of employment.
The committee had recommended a change in the Companies Act to cut to three
years from five the maximum length of a director's contract.
Also announcing their compliance with the code in their 1992 annual reports
are British Gas, the management consultants Holmes and Marchant Group, the
freight group NFC, and Wellcome.
Grand Metropolitan, which violates one of the central recommendations of the
Cadbury report - the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive
 -also includes a compliance statement.
The committee had said that separation of the top roles was desirable but
not absolutely necessary if the proper checks and balances were in place.
Grand Met's statement, from its non-executive deputy chairman, does not
mention the combination of the roles. It does say though that the company
complies with 16 of the 19 recommendations.

FT  10 APR 93 / Pilots to vote on action at BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways faces possible industrial disruption by its 3,500 pilots
that could ground its 200-strong fleet of aircraft and severely affect the
company's finances.
Mr Chris Darke, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association,
warned yesterday that in a ballot later this month his members at BA would
be called on to support action, including strikes.
The discontent stems from the 40 per cent pay disparity between BA's 100
existing pilots at Gatwick Airport, who earn Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 80,000
a year, and 120 less well-paid colleagues formerly employed by Dan Air at
Gatwick.
When BA acquired Dan Air last October it established a separate company at
Gatwick, European Operations Gatwick. EOG has outlined generally inferior
terms and conditions of employment for former Dan Air staff.
Mr Darke said that BA's existing pilots at Gatwick were now being
re-deployed elsewhere to avoid having to increase the salary levels of
pilots who previously worked for Dan Air. 'They want to create a tier of
second-class pilots,' he said. 'The fear among BA pilots is that this could
undermine the whole of their own pay structure.'
He also claimed that future pilot recruits for BA at Gatwick would have to
accept the terms and conditions enjoyed by the former Dan Air pilots.
But BA said last night that the BA pilots at Gatwick would be able to choose
over the next three years whether they moved to BA's main divisions, joined
the company's regional division, or EOG. 'We are not forcing anybody to do
anything. It is entirely voluntary.'
Last month BA agreed to drop a plan to impose pay cuts on cabin crew at
Gatwick when the Transport and General Workers' union took it to an
industrial tribunal.
Mr Charles Stuart, a former chairman of Brymon Airways, has died aged 64. Mr
Stuart, who was credited with the concept of airline shuttle services, spent
20 with British European Airways and its successor British Airways.

FT  10 APR 93 / Tyneside shipyard withdraws notices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIP repairer A &amp; P Appledore Tyne has withdrawn redundancy notices which
were served on the entire hourly-paid manual workforce after workers
rejected a cost-cutting pay and conditions deal.
The unions at the Tyneside company have also with-drawn their threat of a
strike or other industrial action.
The compromise by both sides has cleared the way for talks, due to start on
Tuesday, on how the company can achieve cost savings of 10 per cent, said by
management to be vital to the company's survival.
The company, part of A &amp; P Appledore Holdings, said: 'It means everything is
open to discussion again. We've cleared the air for the real talks on the
real issue, which is to reduce operating costs.'
The GMB general union said: 'We're back where we started, everything is off
the table.'
When the 12-week redundancy notices were served in February the 350 workers
were told that if they wanted to work for the company beyond mid-May they
had to accept new terms of employment.
The rejected package included a pay freeze, lower pay rates for temporary
workers and reduced idle time payments during lay-off periods.
After an unofficial one-day strike last month the staff, who work in repair
yards at North Shields and Wallsend, backed industrial action in a ballot by
four to one. The management said three contracts had been lost because of
the strike threat.
In an agreed statement, issued after talks this week which led to the
compromise, the two sides said: 'We are determined to resolve all our
industrial relations problems internally without any effect on our
customers.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Three corporations amend directors appointment rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE corporations have amended their rules so that executive directors are
periodically required to seek shareholder approval of their appointment.
Ms Anne Simpson, director of Pensions and Investments Research Consultants,
a group which advises shareholders on corporate governance matters, said the
three were TSB Plc, British Petroleum and Commercial Union. All three
companies insulated executive directors from shareholder endorsement,
although TSB required a quarter of its non-executive directors to stand for
election each year.
The companies are now seeking changes to their articles which will provide
for elections for executive directors.
Ms Simpson said: 'This is a great step forward for shareholders. The spirit
of the Cadbury report is accountability of directors, but these insulation
provisions render key executives unaccountable to shareholders.'
Other shareholder groups, including the National Association of Pension
Funds and the Association of British Insurers, have called for insulation
rules to be abandoned.

FT  10 APR 93 / Equal pension age decision delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT decision on equalising male and female state pension ages has
been delayed until mid-summer at the earliest.
The decision is expected to provoke a political row because millions of
women face longer working lives.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is considering postponing the
legislation until the parliamentary session beginning in autumn 1994. A
decision on a common pension age of 65 had been expected soon after Easter
with legislation in the next session.
But options have not yet been considered by a cabinet committee and, even if
legislation is not delayed further, the planned white paper still seems some
way off.
Ministers may decide to await the outcome of the European Court of Justice's
decision in the Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights case -
expected in July.
That case will determine whether equality is required only for pension
benefits earned by service since May 17 1990, the date of the 'Barber'
judgment, or for benefits which were earned by service before that date. The
Barber judgment on equal pay led the government to move towards a common
pension age.
Currently the state retirement age is 60 for women and 65 for men. Although
equalising at 65 has emerged as by far the most likely option, ministers
have not formally made a decision. Nor have they agreed on how to use some
of the expected Pounds 3bn a year savings from raising the female retirement
age - for instance by helping low-income pensioners.
One Whitehall insider said: 'What is happening at the moment is a whole lot
of cold feet about exactly how we ameliorate the announcement. It is getting
that package together that is holding things up.'
A decision would not take effect for at least a decade and would probably be
phased in.

FT  10 APR 93 / Council contracts out roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKSHIRE County Council has awarded one of the largest local government
contracts to the Babtie Group, the Glasgow-based consulting engineers, to
manage its highway and planning services.
Babtie will receive more than Pounds 30m over four years to handle the
council's traffic and road safety services, highway maintenance and waste
management. The council said it was the first local authority to hand over
its highways and planning services to a private-sector contractor.
Mr Tony Allen, the council's chief executive, said: 'The government is
planning to extend compulsory competitive tendering to highways and planning
services in the very near future and we feel we have given our highways and
planning staff a more secure future by getting in first and being in control
of the situation.'
He said the council expected the contract to mean savings of Pounds 1.3m in
1993-94 and increased amounts after that.
Babtie will assume responsibility for traffic monitoring, traffic signals,
bus schemes and highway and bridge maintenance. It will be responsible for
road safety strategy and accident prevention and investigation. It will also
take over waste recycling, landfill design, pollution control and
monitoring, and preparation of waste disposal contracts.
Of the council's 383 highway and planning staff, 309 will become Babtie
employees. Twenty will continue to work for the council, managing the
contract. There will be 14 compulsory redundancies and 14 temporary staff
will leave. Twenty-six are taking voluntary redundancy, the council said.

FT  10 APR 93 / Fowler link to prison escorts 'not improper'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE party officials were last night at pains to distance Sir Norman
Fowler, the party's chairman, from embarrassment surrounding Britain's first
private prisoner escort service, after it emerged that he is a director of a
company that shares the same ultimate parent.
Officials said that the board on which Sir Norman sits has no responsibility
for any of the work carried out by Group 4 Escort Services, which has
experienced three escapes since starting work last week on a five-year
contract covering the east midlands, South and North Yorkshire, Lincolnshire
and Humberside.
For the past three years Sir Norman has been a non-executive director of
Group 4 Securitas, a subsidiary of Dutch-based Group 4 Securitas
International.
Group 4 Securitas is the parent company of all Group 4 companies operating
in Britain, with the exception of those - such as Group 4 Escort Services -
which offer remand and court services.
Mr Alun Michael, a Labour home affairs spokesman, said that the directorship
illustrated the 'unhealthy' relationship between the Conservative party and
that part of the private sector which has a specific interest in the process
of privatisation.
Group 4 said last night there was 'absolutely nothing improper' in Sir
Norman's involvement with the group.
The latest escape came when a 20-year-old man facing traffic charges in
Derby broke out of the van taking him to court.
Mr David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said
yesterday he was not surprised at what had happened and he predicted further
escapes: 'This recurring nightmare will go on as long as this government
continues with its dogmatic policy of contracting out prison escorting.'
The prison service acknowledged 'significant difficulties' had been
experienced in the first few days.
Group 4 claimed that two of the escapes were due to failures in the special
vehicles used to transport prisoners. It insisted that its staff were
properly trained to carry out the tasks.

FT  10 APR 93 / 'Cover up' claim in Salvation Army row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS representing Mr Stuart Ford, the Birmingham businessman alleged to
be at the centre of the Pounds 6.2m fraud against the Salvation Army,
yesterday hit back at allegations that Mr Ford was responsible for the loss
of the charity's money.
Mr Jim Crocker of the law firm Howell and co said, on behalf of Mr Ford,
that the allegations represented a 'cover up' on the charity's part.
'If anybody is guilty of anything then that blame should lie fairly and
squarely at the door of the Salvation Army,' Mr Crocker said.
The accusations against Mr Ford came in an statement issued by the Salvation
Army on Thursday - the first full statement the charity had made since
February, when it issued writs accusing Mr Ford, and his business associate
Mr Gamil Naguib of conspiring to defraud the charity.
Thursday's statement announced that three top Salvation Army officials had
been transfered from their posts, and Colonel Grenville Burn, the Salvation
Army officer in charge of fundraising, had been sacked.
However, General Eva Burrows, the Salvation Army's leader, stressed that on
the basis of an internal investigation conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, the charity had been innocent victims of skilled fraudsters.
Gen Burrows said: 'There is no suspicion of any dishonesty by any of the
people who have been disciplined.'
This position echoes the preliminary findings of the Metropolitan and City
of London Police fraud squad, who have not yet found any evidence
implicating senior charity officials in the fraud.
At the same time, the Charities Commission has announced an inquiry into the
affair.
According to the Salvation Army statement, the money was diverted from its
accounts when two self-styled business advisers, Mr Stuart Ford, and Mr
Gamil Naguib persuaded Col Burn, to transfer Dollars 10m to the Belgium bank
ASLK-CGER, in the spring of 1992, supposedly for investment in letters of
credit.
Although the account was supposed to be under the supervision of top
Salvation Army officials, in June 1992 Col Burn and Mr Ford then moved
Dollars 8.8m into an account of the Banque Continentale du Luxembourg
without proper consultation.
By mid-December the charity learned that this money had been diverted by Mr
Ford and Mr Naguib into a range of different accounts. Consequently, about
Dollars 1m of the missing money has been recovered.
Detectives from the Metropolitan and City of London police fraud squad have
interviewed Col Burn at length and have had access to affidavits made by
other senior officials.
They have also studied documentation relating to bank transactions in
Belgium and Luxembourg.
Mr Ford's lawyers yesterday said that he had voluntarily surrendered himself
to the police on Thursday, before the charity issued its statement. He is
bailed to appear in court in October.

FT  10 APR 93 / Waste legislation that dealers want dumped: The proposed
disposal laws that present a threat to a valued activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICK Nichols grew up travelling on his family's rag-and-bone cart. Now in
his fifties, he continues to ply his father's trade - although his horse has
been replaced by a van - and his livelihood is now threatened by the most
modern of political phenomena - a battle over new environmental legislation.
The Department of the Environment is due to announce early in June a
wide-ranging package of legislation covering waste disposal which would
force scrap dealers to pay for new licences and register all material
handled by their yards.
Although the legislation was planned for April, its introduction has been
delayed - a move that reflects not only the increasing confusion over the
implementation of European Community directives, but also the widespread
protests from the scrap industry.
The issue at stake is whether scrap should be defined as waste. Until now
the Department of Environment has assumed that scrap should be so defined,
with the result that local authorities across the country have treated scrap
dealers in accordance with waste disposal regulations.
The department said: 'These new regulations are basically being introduced
to ensure that we have the highest environmental standards.'
The scrap industry insists, however, that designating scrap as waste is
misconceived. Instead, it says that dealers such as Mr Nichols play a vital
part in the recycling of metals, and their work should be recognised for its
environmental benefits.
Mr John Clubb, director of the British Scrap Federation, said: 'We are not
whingeing - we are prepared to accept regulations. But these regulations
will hit us and hurt the environment.'
He points out that at present local authorities vary greatly in their
interpretation of the existing legislation.
Mr Clubb believes that forcing scrap dealers to pay for new licences and
keep inventories will not only force many of the smaller dealers to close,
but also discourage them from dealing with difficult items. The federation
says scrap dealers handle about 2m vehicles and 5m household appliances such
as washing machines, freezers and cookers a year.
Mr Clubb added: 'When the public sees a filthy old scrapyard, they don't
realise that it does a job which helps the environment. Where else are you
going to dump your old fridge?'
Nevertheless, as the federation admits, the industry faces a difficult
problem in changing its public image, not least because of high- and
low-tech methods of scrap recycling.
The federation estimates that there are 300 large dealers operating in
Britain. In 1991 these produced about 8.5m tonnes of recycled steel,
together with a smaller - but more valuable - quantity of non-ferrous
material. Slightly less than half of the steel was exported, of which 53 per
cent was sent to EC countries, primarily Spain.
The largest dealers, such as Coopers Metals, which has an annual turnover of
about Pounds 200m, stress that their side of the business is highly
modernised. But these larger dealers are themselves dependent on an
estimated 9,000 smaller collectors and traders, who collect different scrap
materials which large dealers believe would be uneconomic to collect.
To a casual observer the methods of small collectors seem to represent a
distasteful side of the business. For while some former rag-and-bone
families have replaced their horses with vans, others are using ever more
basic methods, scavenging in rubbish tips with their bare hands.
One such London based collector, known as 'Spectacles', has spent the past
20 years trawling skips for old wires and metals which he crams into a hand
trolley and sells to scrap dealers. On a good day, when the skips are full
and the site managers generous, he makes about Pounds 10.
'Gun metal is the best - you get good prices for that. Then zinc or
aluminium,' he explained. 'But iron's the worst because no one wants it. The
price has fallen right low.'
The scrap wire he collects is sold on to a local scrap metal yard which
cleans and strips it and then sells it on to re-finers.
According to HP Dicks, one of these refiners, most of the aluminium is then
exported, with the lead going to British factories that manufacture
batteries. Most of the scrap steel is refined in the UK.
The larger dealers insist that itinerants present an out-dated picture of
the business. Nevertheless, with their numbers apparently growing, swelled
by the young homeless, the rag-and-bone image seems set to dog the industry
 -and the forthcoming legislation - for a long time.

FT  10 APR 93 / Tories talk up recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMY is showing 'signs of improvement', Mr Tony Newton said
yesterday, as senior Tories used the recess to talk up the prospects for
recovery before parliament's return on Wednesday.
On the first anniversary of the government's general election victory the
leader of the Commons acknowledged it had been 'a very difficult year' but
said the government was moving in the right direction.
His remarks followed party chairman Sir Norman Fowler's use of a party
political broadcast to deliver an equally upbeat message that there were now
'clear signs' of economic recovery.
Both men also hit at recent criticism of the leadership qualities of Mr John
Major, prime minister, who was expected to spend the weekend in his
Huntingdon constituency.
After a day debating the Criminal Justice Bill, aimed at tightening rules on
insider dealing, MPs are due to turn yet again to the bill implementing the
Maastricht treaty, which will have its 20th day in committee on Thursday.
The main initial point of interest is likely to be whether Mr Michael
Morris, who chairs the sessions when the bill is discussed in detail, has
again changed his mind about allowing a vote on a potentially crucial Labour
amendment.
Mr Morris announced last month that he had reversed his decision to allow a
vote on the amendment which would remove the protocol containing Britain's
opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter.
A number of Tory Euro-sceptics have since asked him to reconsider.
Although a new clause offering MPs a further opportunity to debate and vote
on the chapter has presented a fresh obstacle to the bill's passage,
ministers have been encouraged by the measure's comparatively rapid recent
progress.

FT  10 APR 93 / Militant seeks control of Civil Service union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILITANT Tendency, the Marxist group, is trying to win control of
Britain's largest Civil Service union, the 125,000-strong Civil and Public
Service Association.
In the past Militant was quick to deny that it was an organised faction in
the union. Now, for the first time, it has launched a public campaign for
power in the union's annual elections.
Postal voting starts on Monday for the union's presidency and
vice-presidency, as well as for all 18 seats on its executive council. There
is growing concern among the present moderate leadership that Militant is
poised for victory. Results will be announced on May 10 at the union's
annual conference.
Mr Barry Reambottom, the union's general secretary, said yesterday: 'The
union is in serious danger of being captured by extremists. The Militant is
campaigning openly for power in a way it has never done before.'
Mr Reambottom said Militant was in a 'resurgent and buoyant' mood. 'I am
deeply concerned that, because of the many difficulties our members face,
the Militant has an ideal opportunity to exploit the great reservoir of
discontent in their favour.'
In a leaflet published last week, Militants in the union said they were
'openly playing a leading role' in the election campaign and had 'initiated
calls for a united opposition to the current union leadership'.
'This has resulted in an electoral alliance on the basis of opposition to
the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling and market testing and in defence
of union democracy,' it says.
The leaflet adds: 'Faced with large-scale threats to jobs through
privatisation and a virtual pay freeze recommended by the current moderate
leadership of the union, CPSA members increasingly are turning to the broad
left in which Militant Labour supporters openly play a leading role, for an
alternative leadership.' It claims the broad left has almost three times as
many branch nominations as the moderate incumbents and suggests it is
'heading for a landslide victory'.
Mr Larry O'Callaghan, head of the union's Home Office section and an
executive committee candidate, said: 'Militant supporters are proud and open
about our socialist beliefs. It is precisely because of factors such as low
pay and the inability of the current leadership to do anything about it that
members are increasingly looking for a more positive leadership.'
Mr Phil Marston, a Militant member of the union, said: 'Politics do not come
into it. More and more people are supporting us because we are prepared to
stand up and do something about their complaints.'
In a leaflet the moderate union president Mrs Marion Chambers urges union
members not to allow the Militants to use them as a 'political battering
ram'. She faces a serious challenge from Mr Albert Astbury, a
self-proclaimed independent who heads the broad left list.

FT  10 APR 93 / Customs &amp; Excise outlines its targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HM CUSTOMS &amp; Excise plans to reduce mistakes in the payment of value added
tax - payments that are either under or over - by Pounds 3.3bn during
1993-94, according to its management plan published this week.
That compares with estimated gross total receipts of about Pounds 280bn of
VAT from traders last year. The target includes the collection of Pounds
1.5bn in net additional liabilities as a result of under-declaration.
The management plan, which covers the period 1993-96, includes a detailed
strategy setting out the department's objectives for the next five years.
Its four commitments are to encourage openness and participation, maximise
career opportunities, avoid compulsory redundancies and ensure that in-house
bids for those functions to be market tested can compete fairly. It says
staff numbers will be reduced by more than 5 per cent a year.
The plan says it aims to ensure that three quarters of intra-EC trade by
value during the first quarter of this year will be reported by May 31.
Ms Valerie Strachan, who chairs the Customs &amp; Excise board, said that there
was more stress in the plan on quality of service and on Customs'
relationship with the professional and business community.
The plan commits Customs to introducing a new pay system and grading
structure delegated from centralised pay bargaining by April 1 next year.
Other elements of the plan include evaluations over the next year of the
movement of goods in the EC, the collection of trade statistics and dealing
with travellers and anti-smuggling controls. It requires achieving improved
VAT compliance by traders and, visits to all newly registered traders within
three years.

FT  10 APR 93 / PosTel puts southern farmland valued at Pounds 15m up for
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, one of the UK's largest institutional investors, is putting 7,745
acres of farmland up for sale.
The fund's proposed disposal follows a decision several years ago to reduce
its agricultural land holdings. The value of the four farms for sale in
Hampshire and Wiltshire is about Pounds 15m, although no asking price has
been decided.
PosTel, which invests the pension funds of British Telecom and the Post
Office, bought the farms in the mid-1970s. At that time many institutions
acquired agricultural property in the belief that it would prove a good
hedge against inflation.
This trend was reversed in the 1980s when the funds became disillusioned
with the performance of agricultural property.
According to Savills, property adviser, the value of the land has fallen by
about 60 per cent in real terms since 1979 to about Pounds 1,500 an acre.
Values in real terms are at their lowest for 30 years.
Many institutions disinvested from agricultural property in recent years to
concentrate on core portfolios. Notable recent deals include the sale by
British Coal's pension fund of a 11,500-acre estate in 1990, Guardian Royal
Exchange's sale of 22,500 acres of land in 1991, and Norwich Union's sale of
9,500 acres to the Crown Estate last year.
PosTel said it would start marketing three of the estates in May. The
properties are the 2,275-acre Brown Candover Estate near Winchester, the
1,150-acre Manor Farm at North Oakley near Basingstoke and the 720-acre
Manor Farm at West Overton near Marlborough.
A fourth estate, the 3,600-acre Longwood Estate near Winchester, is likely
to be put on the later. The farms have been managed by Booker Farming for
the past eight years.
Mr Richard Denny of Cluttons, which is marketing the Hampshire estates, said
he expected the buyer to be a commercial farmer, possibly one with adjoining
land. Mr Andrew Martin of PosTel said he expected 'significant interest' in
the estates.
Mr Denny said there had been few good quality farms placed on the market in
the past year. The shortage of stock and an improvement in farm
profitability was likely to lead to a tentative recovery in the agricultural
land market, he said. 'There is more confidence in the market although I
don't anticipate a dramatic increase in values.'
The decline in real property values in the 1980s was largely due to
declining farm incomes as a result of reforms of the Common Agricultural
Policy, which was producing unsustainably large food surpluses. The decline
was interrupted briefly by rising prices in 1988-89, when land values were
boosted by new investors, often wealthy business people wishing to live in
the countryside.
But demand evaporated once the recession took hold and prices fell sharply
from a peak of Pounds 2,300 an acre in 1988 to about Pounds 1,500.
The agreement reached over reform of the CAP last year, which will result in
the set-aside of 1.5m acres of farmland, took some of the uncertainty out of
the agricultural market. The reduction of interest rates and improvements in
farm profitability reduced the risk of forced sales of farms.
Another important factor in stabilising farm values was the fall in the
value of sterling after its exit from the exchange rate mechanism in
September, which boosted farm incomes. According to the Ministry of
Agriculture devaluation and lower interest rates resulted in a 23.6 per cent
increase in UK farm incomes to Pounds 1.8bn last year.
The view that farmland values have stabilised is supported by a recent
survey by the Farmland Market journal and the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors. It said although few surveyors expected farm price increases this
year, a prolonged shortage of new properties on the market could lead to
small increases.

FT  10 APR 93 / Old formula returns to Donington's circuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEICESTERSHIRE entrepreneur Mr Bernard 'Tom' Wheatcroft, 70, is listening
this weekend to music which, at times, he feared he would never hear.
It is the sound of an entire Formula One motor racing pack baying around
Donington Park, the motor racing circuit near Leicester which he bought 22
years ago. Since then he has battled - until this year unsuccessfully - to
stage a round of the grand prix world championship there.
Mr Wheatcroft, a tough, no-nonsense businessman whose fortune was founded on
property development, is first to acknowledge that there is a strong
commercial incentive to stage a grand prix.
There are expected to be 130,000 spectators at the track, each paying Pounds
55-Pounds 120 for the grand prix itself tomorrow. Several thousand more have
been camped out for the past two days of practice. There are millions to be
made from corporate hospitality and other catering, clothing and other
trappings of motor racing.
But, for Mr Wheatcroft, the money really does rank a distant second.
He has difficulty expressing his satisfaction that grand prix cars are again
racing at Donington, nearly 60 years after the echoes of its last grand prix
 -fought out between Mercedes and Auto-Union in 1938 - were drowned out by
the onset of war. Mr Wheatcroft, a motor racing devotee since childhood, had
cycled to the track to watch them.
He has fought against the entrenched interests of the rival circuit,
Silverstone, and grand prix racing's organisers to achieve his goal. Five
times in the past he has been promised a grand prix but it has slipped
through his fingers.
In the mid-1980s his campaign appeared to have failed for good. The world
governing body of motor sport decreed than that there should be only one
grand prix per country.
The idea of a 'European' grand prix, which had allowed Brands Hatch to stage
a race as well, was scrapped. His sophistic attempt to stage an 'Irish'
grand prix in England also failed.
Now, Donington's grand prix, again entitled 'European', results from the
cancellation of the Asian grand prix scheduled for Japan.
But with more than Pounds 500,000 spent on improvements at the circuit and
more than Pounds 4m spent altogether Mr Wheatcroft will not willingly see
Donington dropped from the calendar. Rather, he wants to wrest the British
grand prix from Silverstone when the latter's contractual title to it ends
in 1996.
It is not only opponents within motor sport whom Mr Wheatcroft has fought.
He had a series of battles with local authorities to rebuild the circuit.
And, in recent weeks, he had to fight again.
This time the battle was to get the Leicestershire County Council's planning
and recreation committee to reverse its refusal to let him stage this
weekend's race, because it opposed, on proclaimed environmental grounds, the
holding of two grands prix in a year. The circuit already stages the British
motorcycle grand prix.
The resistance mystified Mr Wheatcroft, because both district councils
surrounding the circuit backed the grand prix, and neither police nor
adjoining Derbyshire County Council raised objections.
In a region of the Midlands with high unemployment calculations that the
grand prix will pump nearly Pounds 5m into the local economy appear to have
helped win the day. This weekend the circuit's permanent staff of 11 will be
swelled to a temporary one of more than 700.

FT  10 APR 93 / Failed bank monitored for several months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England closely monitored Roxburghe Bank for several months
before it went into administration on Wednesday, it has emerged.
Administrators are examining the operation of the business, including its
unusually high volume of deposits from overseas and the uncertainty about
the level of provisions required against bad loans.
The directors of Roxburghe, which was based in Mayfair in London, decided on
Tuesday to apply to the High Court for an administration order under UK
insolvency law.
Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, said yesterday he would be
seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, when MPs
return next week from the Easter recess.
Mr Vaz said that five banks directly serving Britain's Asian community had
now either been closed by the Bank or had voluntarily shut down and it would
take 'a great deal of explaining' to demonstrate that 'all of this is just a
coincidence'.
Mr Vaz referred to last month's disclosure by the Bank that in 1991 it had
launched financial lifeboats for a number of small- and medium-sized banks.
The Bank needed to explain why it had adopted different criteria when
dealing with institutions such as Roxburghe Bank, he said.
Mr Tony Lomas, one of the joint administrators from accountants Price
Waterhouse, said Roxburghe needed to seek protection from its creditors
because it would have been unable to meet demands for the increasing amount
of withdrawals before the end of April.
He said there were also concerns about whether it had net liabilities,
because it had Pounds 45m in assets at the end of February against Pounds
40m in liabilities plus the need to make further provisions of up to Pounds
6m.
The effective closure of the bank is the fourth in the past year to affect
the Asian community directly since the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in 1991.
Equatorial Bank and Mount Banking have since both ceased taking new
business. Albaraka International Bank's deposit-taking activities have been
suspended.
Mr Lomas said Roxburghe's Pounds 40m in liabilities was about evenly split
between cash deposits and loans to small Asian businesses in the south of
England. The largest loan was for about Pounds 2m.
He said most of the depositors were from overseas, predominantly based in
India and Kenya, with some accounts holding hundreds of thousands of pounds
each. Only about 10 per cent of the depositors lived in the UK.
The bank already had about Pounds 1m in provisions against bad debts, and
there was currently a debate about the size of additional provisions which
needed to be made of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 6m.
Under administration Roxburghe can theoretically continue to accept new
deposits from existing customers although none can currently make
withdrawals. The Bank has forbidden the bank from accepting deposits from
any new customers.
Mr Lomas said he would be writing in the next day or two to all depositors
and expected to provide them with a full report well within the three months
allowed for a report to creditors under administration procedures.
The accounts for the year to December 31 1991 show loans to three of the
directors of Pounds 120,000 and to two directors in 1990 of Pounds 87,000.
They also show an account with a credit of Pounds 43,000 in the name of J H
Shah, one of the directors, and another with a credit of Pounds 7,000 to J &amp;
R Shah Associates, a company controlled by Mr J H Shah and Mr R H Shah,
another director.

FT  10 APR 93 / Rate cuts bring little benefit to north-west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW INFLATION and reduced interest rates have had little or no direct impact
on the majority of companies, according to a survey of business in
north-west England by Latham, Crossley &amp; Davis, a Manchester, Chorley and
Wigan firm of accountants.
In a surprising result, 68 per cent said low inflation had brought no direct
benefit, while 56 per cent said low base rates had been equally ineffective.
The survey was conducted in the second half of last month as part of a
series begun last summer involving 700 businesses.
Companies said low inflation had helped maintain prices but had not made
planning for investment any more certain. They said with business harder to
find, levels of interest rates were irrelevant because there were no extra
orders to finance with borrowings.
Others also complained of poor returns on cash reserves because banks were
paying even lower interest than they were charging borrowers. 'Low base
rates have been a two-edged sword,' one said.
However, most business were in favour of lower inflation and borrowing costs
because they were likely to make recovery more sustainable. They felt a
consistent philosophy was apparent in the economy, favouring slow organic
growth from which they would benefit indirectly.
An overwhelming 87 per cent were equally or more confident than a year ago
about long-term prospects. Asked to rate confidence on a scale of one to 10,
the average score was 6.25, the highest recorded so far, except for
November, when respondents were hoping for a pre-Christmas consumer spending
spree.
Mr Keith Seeley, managing partner of the accountancy firm, said: 'An
increasing number of businessmen are scoring their confidence as six, seven,
or eight out of 10. At this stage of the economic cycle, belief that
recovery in under way may be as important in improving confidence as a large
increase in orders.'

FT  10 APR 93 / NUT may boycott all school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers, the largest of the teaching unions,
yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Mr John Patten, education
secretary, to withdraw controversial school tests by announcing that it was
considering boycotting all the school tests this summer.
At the start of its annual conference in Brighton, the union said that its
executive had agreed to a union vote today on whether to hold a ballot for a
complete boycott.
It also warned that unless Mr Patten radically reformed the testing system,
the union was likely to support a further boycott in the following year.
If the NUT goes ahead with a boycott this summer, it presents a serious
challenge to Mr Patten's plans to hold school tests for 14-year-olds this
summer in subjects like English and technology, and may also affect similar
tests for seven and 11-year-olds.
The second largest teaching union, the NASUWT, has already announced a
boycott of the English tests for 14-year-olds. The more moderate union, the
ATL, announced at its own conference this week that it would also ballot its
members over a boycott in spite of an announcement by Mr Patten that he was
planning an urgent review of the national curriculum and the testing system.
Speaking at an NUT briefing yesterday, Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general
secretary, predicted that if, as expected, his members supported the ballot
and the boycott, Mr Patten would be forced to back down.
'There has been plenty of evidence over the last few months of government
U-turns. I predict the secretary of state will have to accept the logic of
the situation and abandon the tests,' he said.
He added: 'If the review is to be meaningful there can be no educationally
sound reason for holding this summer's tests.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Second fugitive arrested in Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH police yesterday arrested Mr Pearse McAuley, who is wanted in Britain
in connection with conspiracy to murder and other terrorist crimes. Mr
McAuley escaped from Brixton jail in south London two years ago.
His fellow fugitive, Mr Nessan Quinlivan, was detained by Irish detectives
last Sunday after a raid on a farmhouse in Co Tipperary and later faced
firearms charges in the anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court in Dublin.
Mr McAuley was detained at Dublin's Connolly station.
He was arrested by special branch officers under Ireland's Offences Against
the State Act for questioning about the possession of a firearm and other
offences.
Both men are wanted by Scotland Yard for the Brixton break-out and plots to
kill Sir Charles Tidbury, the former Whitbread brewery chairman, and to
cause explosions in Britain.
Mr Quinlivan is due back in court after Easter. So far no formal attempt has
been made for his extradition to Britain and the Irish authorities have made
clear the charges against him in Dublin will have to take precedence.
The IRA yesterday released a video showing armed terrorists. The
three-minute tape of masked men in battledress was accompanied by a warning
that Britain must choose between peace and what it described as 'the
inevitability of war'.

FT  10 APR 93 / Further EC complication for contracting-out plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR workers affected by contracting out may be able to refuse
transfer to private-sector contractors and claim the substantial payments
available under public-sector redundancy schemes, following a recent
judgment at the European Court of Justice.
Many UK lawyers believe the judgment in Katsikas v Konstantinidis could add
another complication to government contracting-out plans dogged by the EC
Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Protection of Employment) - Tupe.
The Tupe regulations often require that public-sector workers' pay and jobs
are secured when their undertakings are transferred to the private sector.
It has been believed, however, that where the regulations apply, the common
law right to refuse to transfer to the new employer is superseded, with the
effect that redundancy cannot be claimed from the old employer.
But Ms Melanie Tether, employment law specialist at solicitors Norton Rose
in London, said: 'The Katsikas case raises serious doubts about the
legitimacy of this aspect of the regulations.'
The case arose in the German courts when a restaurant business was sold. An
employee refused to transfer to the new owner and claimed compensation from
the old owner. German law, like UK law, allows an employee to object to the
transfer but the new owner argued this was incompatible with Tupe.
The European Court of Justice disagreed and said each member state could
decide if employees should be given the option of resisting transfer. The UK
government did not offer that option in the Tupe regulations. But, as it was
thereby removing an old common law right, it may have been wrong under
European law not to offer the option.
Mr John McMullen of solicitors Simpson Curtis in Leeds said: 'The bombshell
effect of this for companies is that they may be faced with a group of
employees who refuse to transfer and are therefore entitled to claim
termination payments.'

FT  10 APR 93 / Recovery in truck sales peters out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TENTATIVE recovery in commercial vehicle sales in the final months of 1992
petered out in the first quarter of this year.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that
registrations of commercial vehicles last month were 11.75 per cent lower
than in the same month a year ago.
The March figures are in stark contrast to those for registrations of new
cars, which were up 11.58 per cent in March compared with the year-ago
month.
In its role as an economic indicator, the vehicle market is thus sending
conflicting signals to the government about the prospects for recovery.
The fact that sales of commercial vehicles - which are driven mainly by
commercial and industrial activity - remain so badly depressed heightens
suspicions that the car market recovery is being over-stated by dealers and
manufacturers. They may be by registering cars for which there are, as yet,
no final buyers in an effort to boost market shares and keep plants busy.
The 17,741 commercial vehicle sales in March, down from 20,103 a year ago,
meant that sales in the first quarter as whole were 5.36 per cent lower than
in the same quarter of 1992.
The receivership at Leyland Daf, which has been a substantial exporter to
the Continent, and increasing imports of Vauxhall of light vans built in
Portugal were among the factors in a sharp rise in imports.
They took a 42.21 per cent share of the market in March compared with 34.11
per cent in the year-ago period. In the first quarter they rose to 40.71 per
cent compared with 35.37 per cent a year ago.
With the exception of small vans, mainly those derived from cars, all main
sectors of the commercial vehicle market are running below the first quarter
of last year.
Worst hit are panel van sales, which are down nearly 12 per cent, and heavy
trucks - those over 15 tonnes - down by nearly 6 per cent. However, light
van sales are up 3.85 per cent in the quarter.
Leyland Daf's problems have meant that Iveco group, controlled by Fiat of
Italy and incorporating Ford's UK truck operations, is now the clear truck
market leader. It had a share of 26.51 per cent for the quarter compared
with 18.51 per cent for Leyland Daf, which has been demoted to third behind
Mercedes-Benz.

<TEXT>
MR SHIMON Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday that he would
not object to talking to Palestinians from east Jerusalem, agencies report
from Jerusalem.
The Clinton administration in the US has proposed that Israel accept Mr
Faisal Husseini, a prominent east Jerusalem Arab, as head of the Palestinian
negotiating team in order to coax Palestinians back to negotiations, set to
resume in Washington on April 20.
Mr Peres stressed on Israeli army radio that excluding Arab negotiators from
Jerusalem was a policy of the previous, right-wing Likud government in
Israel, which had argued that to talk with such people would mean conceding
Israel's claim to rule the city.
Mr Peres added that he has 'never ruled out Faisal Husseini.' He said: 'On
the ground, Faisal Husseini heads the Palestinian team. The Americans are
speaking with him. We are not deaf or blind.'
Mr Husseini, who has close ties to the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
has been denied a formal role in the talks because Israel has objected to
sitting down with Arabs from Jerusalem.

FT  10 APR 93 / Charge in India for Union Carbide

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN subsidiary of Union Carbide, the US chemicals group, has been
charged with manslaughter, in much-delayed legal action arising from the
1984 Bhopal gas explosion.
Mr Keshub Mahindra, subsidiary chairman and a top Indian industrialist, and
seven other past or present Union Carbide India employees, were also charged
on Thursday.
Charges have also been filed against the US parent company; Union Carbide
(Eastern), the company's Hong Kong operation; and Mr Warren Anderson, who
was the parent company chairman at the time of the explosion at the
company's pesticide factory in Bhopal, central India.
However, neither the parent company, nor the Hong Kong operation, nor Mr
Anderson has appeared before Indian courts. All are being treated as
absconders from Indian justice.
More than 3,800 people were killed when a cloud of toxic gas escaped from
storage tanks at the Bhopal plant. Tens of thousands were injured in one of
the world's worst industrial disasters.
About 40 people, including 11 soldiers, have been killed in the latest
violence in India's troubled northern state of Kashmir. Six of the dead were
soldiers killed when their Jeep was blown up on Thursday.
Violence in Kashmir has been rising since 1989 as Kashmiri Moslems have been
taking up arms in support of their political demands.

THOUSANDS of angry Moslems took to the streets of Dhaka yesterday to protest
against the attendance of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister, at a
south Asian summit, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Dhaka.
'Rao, cancel your visit; shame that you are coming here,' the protesters
chanted, before being forced to flee by riot police, one eye-witness in the
Bangladeshi capital said.
Mr Rao was due to arrive in Dhaka today, hours before the eighth summit of
the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) is to begin in
Dhaka.
The protesters demanded that Mr Rao allow Bangladesh what they called a fair
share of waters from the Ganges river - the subject of a long-running
dispute - and that he promise to rebuild the Babri mosque in north India
which was demolished by Hindu zealots in December.
The protesters were mostly members of two right-wing political groups, the
Jatiya Ganotantrik party and National Democratic party, eye-witnesses said.
'India is not only interfering with Bangladesh's independence but hurting
the sentiments of the Moslems,' the two parties said in a joint statement.
The government imposed extra-tight security in the capital, with 8,000
soldiers and police on round-the-clock duty for the meeting of the leaders
of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
It also banned rallies, marches and any sort of protest during the summit.

FT  10 APR 93 / N Korean leader names son to head military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kim Jong-il, the son and designated successor of North Korean President
Kim Il-sung, yesterday obtained virtual control over the country's armed
forces when he was appointed chairman of the national defence committee.
This is considered a key step in Mr Kim's assumption of power from his
father, who will be 81 on April 15. The transfer of power will be completed
once the 51-year-old Mr Kim has become president of North Korea and
general-secretary of the Korean Workers' Party, the two main posts now held
by his father, who has ruled the country since 1945.
The naming of Mr Kim to the highest military post comes amid speculation
that he faces opposition from hard-liners within the 1.1m-strong armed
forces.
South Korean officials believe Mr Kim decided to withdraw North Korea from
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last month and declare a temporary
state of 'semi-war' in a bid to assert his authority over the military and
win its support.
'He needed to prove that he was an able and tough leader,' Mr Han Sung-joo,
South Korean foreign minister, said recently.
Analysts in Seoul believe that the northern military may be opposed to Mr
Kim's succession because it fears its influence will be reduced once he
achieves full power.
Mr Kim lacks a military background, unlike his father, who was a guerrilla
leader against the Japanese in Manchuria in the 1930s and 1940s. The elder
Mr Kim and his military colleagues formed the nucleus of power in North
Korea after 1945. Many of the younger Mr Kim's aides, however, are
technocrats believed to favour limited reforms, such as opening the country
to foreign investment. The North Korean parliament this week approved new
and more liberal foreign investment laws modelled on Chinese practices.
Mr Kim has concentrated on building ties with the military during the last
few years. He was appointed first vice-chairman of the national defence
committee in 1990, supreme commander of the armed forces in 1991 and a
marshal last April.
Some South Korean analysts claim that his assumption of full control over
the military may make him feel more secure and persuade him to reverse North
Korea's withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty. They note that the two
Koreas suddenly signed a non-nuclear pact a week after Mr Kim had become
supreme commander in December 1991.

FT  10 APR 93 / A deceptive blossoming arouses many doubts: Robert Thomson
takes the temperature of the Japanese economy amid first worries about
overheating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DELICATE petals of Tokyo's cherry blossom trees are fluttering to ground
after a beautiful but brief existence, inspiring the annual batch of
Japanese poetry about human frailty, and prompting comparisons to the
perceived flowering of Japan's 'economic recovery'.
Finance ministry officials may be in the final days of negotiation with
other ministries on another emergency package to stimulate growth, but Mr
Hajime Funada, director-general of the economic planning agency, warned this
week that an already revived economy is in danger of 'overheating'.
He may be referring to the renewed vigour at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where
the Nikkei market average again momentarily crossed the 20,000 line
yesterday, or the strengthening of the yen, whose erratic movements are
partly founded on the interpretation that the worst is over in Japan.
Debate over the arrival - or not - of the recovery has complicated the
negotiations on the stimulatory package, due on Tuesday and now estimated to
total Y12,000bn (Pounds 70bn).
A finance ministry official involved in the preparations said: 'we want to
make sure the recovery is a firm one', though he conceded, 'we don't know
whether recovery will be L-shaped or U-shaped'.
However, close scrutiny of economic indicators, other than the stock market
index, suggests that the spring recovery could be as fleeting as the cherry
blossom, which survives on the tree for about two and half weeks.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, remains concerned by 'weak
final demand', meaning personal consumption and corporate capital
investment.
Bank officials also fear that premature talk of recovery will tempt troubled
companies to avoid the painful reforms needed to improve core profitability.
Companies do appear to be gaining confidence. Mitsubishi Corporation, the
trading house at the centre of the Mitsubishi group, said yesterday that it
has begun reviewing gloomy forecasts.
NEC, the electronics company, said bottom was apparently touched in November
or December, and 'things are picking up'.
Sifting through the indicators, companies were encouraged by a 1.5 per cent
year-on-year increase in new car sales in March, after 14 consecutive months
of decline. Housing starts rose 6.3 per cent in February, after an increase
of 0.9 per cent in January.
Another sign of revival was a slim 0.2 per cent expansion of money supply in
February, after a contraction of 0.3 per cent in the previous month.
But these positive figures are more than matched by indicators which suggest
that a recovery may not come until next year, and bring only a modest
increase in sales, not a return to the dizzy heights of the late 1980s, for
which some ambitious manufacturers are still geared.
The car sales figures were an improvement, but also reflected a rush of new
model releases by Japanese makers. Housing starts by owner-occupiers are
gathering momentum, but the rental market is very weak and the overall
private construction market is frail.
Orders received by the 57 largest contractors were down 36.3 per cent in
February, against a year earlier.
Public sector construction orders will be spurred by the government package,
but the public market is about a third the size of the private construction
market.
Land prices are still falling, office rents were down by 30 to 40 per cent
last year in some Tokyo districts, and banks, weighed down by bad loans, are
unwilling to lend to developers.
The 'final demand' problem, identified by Mr Mieno and discusssed this week
at a meeting of the Bank of Japan's regional branch managers, is far from
solved. Consumers seem not to share the stock market's confidence, as
department store sales were down 6.1 per cent in February while smaller
retailers reported a 5.4 drop in their sales.
Consumer wariness has come with concerns about job security and salary
levels. Overtime is falling, and the Japanese workforce shrank by 0.4 per
cent in February, the first decline in seven years.
The most obvious victims of cost-cutting are women, as the number working
fell by 410,000 or 1.6 per cent over the year
These patterns are not reflected in the core unemployment figure, steady at
2.3 per cent in February, after edging to 2.4 per cent in December. But
there is evidence of change in the jobs-to-applicants ratio, which stood at
0.91 in February, meaning that seekers outnumbered vacancies. In September,
the ratio was 1.01 - that is, slightly more jobs than applicants.
Corporate Japan may sense that a recovery has begun, but cost-cutting plans
remain in place and will continue to dampen demand.
A survey by Long-term Credit Bank of Japan found that listed companies
intend to cut capital spending by an average 4 per cent this fiscal year,
following a 3.9 per cent decline in the year just ended.
Instead of drawing attention to an imminent recovery, LTCB noted, 'virtually
all industries are trimming their investments' and 'many industries that
have been slow to adjust to economic changes will finally begin cutting
their investments in earnest'. Sumitomo Metal Mining, a member of the
Sumitomo group, announced yesterday that capital spending will fall 45 per
cent this year.
Companies are still digesting capacity added during the late 1980s, when
machinery orders from manufacturers rose 18.5 per cent. Last year, orders
from the same sector fell 18.6 per cent, and another 14.9 per cent fall was
reported in January.
The electronics sector still appears to have over-capacity of 30-40 per
cent, and depreciation charges on recently added facilities are continuing
to rise.
The mixed statistical signals have put extra pressure on the finance
ministry to design a new package that stimulates final demand, and assists
small and medium-sized companies, and not just the construction industry.
Ministry officials concede that smaller companies are facing a 'credit
crunch' because of banks' reluctance to lend, stimulating demand for funds
from government-affiliated institutions.

<TEXT>
MR SHIMON Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday that he would not
object to talking to Palestinians from east Jerusalem, AP reports from
Jerusalem.
The US administration has proposed that Israel accept Mr Faisal Husseini, a
prominent east Jerusalem Arab, as head of the Palestinian negotiating team
in order to coax Palestinians back to negotiations, set to resume in
Washington.
Mr Peres stressed on Israeli army radio that excluding Arab negotiators from
Jerusalem was a policy of the previous, right-wing Likud government in
Israel, which had argued that to talk with such people would mean conceding
Israel's claim on the city.
Mr Peres added that he has 'never ruled out Faisal Husseini.' He said that,
'on the ground, Faisal Husseini heads the Palestinian team. The Americans
are speaking with him. We are not deaf or blind.'
Mr Husseini, who has close ties to the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
has been denied a formal role in the talks because Israel objects to sitting
down with Arabs from Jerusalem.
Reuter reports from Amman: Palestinian negotiators will meet US officials in
Washington again before deciding whether to attend the next round of Middle
East peace talks on April 20, the chief Palestinian delegate said yesterday.
'We will be leaving for Washington in mid-April for further discussions with
the US administration on our requests,' Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi said.

FT  10 APR 93 / Blood stains the peace of a nation eager to vote: Victor
Mallet assesses the factional strife in Cambodia as the UN tries to protect
electors looking forward to a poll next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEACE in Cambodia was supposed to be one of the dividends from the end of
the Cold War, but neither the new-found goodwill among the superpowers nor
the presence of 22,000 United Nations peace-keepers seems able to end
Cambodia's gruesome conflict.
More than 100 people were known to have been killed throughout the country
last month, many of them immigrant Vietnamese women and children massacred
in a fishing village by suspected Khmer Rouge guerrillas. A week ago, three
Bulgarian UN peace-keepers were murdered in cold blood by Khmer Rouge
gunmen, after having the guerrillas to a friendly supper in their UN tent.
On Thursday, a 25-year-old Japanese volunteer working as an electoral
officer was killed in an ambush.
Tension is rising throughout the country. The US embassy in Bangkok said
yesterday it had advised travellers not to go to Siem Reap, the northern
Cambodian town which is the site of the ancient Khmer temples of Angkor.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas are active in the area.
The current violence is a far cry from the scene in Paris on October 23,
1991, when the various Cambodian factions, the five permanent members of the
UN Security Council and other concerned countries ceremoniously signed a
comprehensive peace agreement providing for a ceasefire and a UN-monitored
election.
The accord was possible because, as the Soviet empire crumbled, the
Soviet-backed Vietnamese had announced the withdrawal of their troops from
Cambodia in 1989, and the US and China had nudged their guerrilla proteges -
who had been fighting the Vietnamese occupation - towards the negotiating
table.
All four principal Cambodian factions put their names to the agreement: the
Phnom Penh administration, installed by the Vietnamese after the invasion of
1978 which had overthrown the Khmer Rouge; the Khmer Rouge itself, the
Chinese-backed extreme left organisation blamed for the deaths of 1m
Cambodians during its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978; the royalist
group Funcinpec; and the US-supported Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
Almost from the start, however, the agreement was flouted by the two
factions with the only significant military forces in Cambodia - the Khmer
Rouge and the Phnom Penh administration.
The ceasefire was ignored. Khmer Rouge leaders refused to allow UN forces
into the swathes of territory they control along the border with Thailand,
and they refused to disarm or demobilise their fighters in accordance with
the agreement, thus forcing the other factions to keep their weapons as
well.
Sensing the likelihood of a humiliating defeat at the polls, the Khmer Rouge
has also condemned the election and sought to strengthen its political
influence by stoking the fires of Cambodian nationalism and launching a hate
campaign against the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese settlers in
Cambodia.
Khmer Rouge officials try to justify their intransigence by claiming (with
scant evidence) that thousands of Vietnamese troops are still in Cambodia
and by saying (with some justification) that the UN, instead of treating the
Phnom Penh administration as one of four equal factions, has let it retain
too much control over government ministries.
The administration, meanwhile, has been intimidating voters in many
districts with all the authority and guns at its disposal, and is suspected
of murdering more than 20 Funcinpec campaign workers.
'Sometimes,' wrote Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN transitional authority
in Cambodia, in a gloomy report to his staff last month, 'the behaviour of
the Cambodian parties makes it seem as if only Untac is trying to carry out
the Paris agreement, even though all of them signed it.'
Untac is often blamed for not moving quickly or forcefully enough to
implement the peace accord. In particular, its critics say, it should have
established itself in Khmer Rouge zones from the start and taken firm
control of government ministries in the capital.
In their defence, Untac officers say the success or failure of the peace
plan depends not on the UN but on the willingness of the Cambodians to
implement the agreement they signed in Paris. The accord clearly states that
Untac's job on the military side is to 'supervise, monitor and verify' the
ceasefire - no mention of enforcement.
However helpful the superpowers may have been - and China's attitude remains
ambivalent - neither Thailand, whose armed forces are overtly sympathetic to
the Khmer Rouge, nor Cambodia's leading politicians appear to have done
enough to ensure the success of the peace plan.
Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian 'god-king' regarded as the one leader who can
unite his country behind him, has spent much of the crucial past few months
thousands of kilometres away in Beijing and issuing a confusing series of
statements alternately praising and condemning Untac.
Mr Akashi and the UN, for want of any other plausible option, seem
determined to press ahead with the voting from May 23-27, although Mr Akashi
has painted himself into an embarrassing corner by saying often that
conditions are not yet right for the free and fair election specified by the
Paris agreement, when there is every sign that the violence is getting
worse.
Even if the election proceeds as planned, it is possible that militarily
weak parties, such as Funcinpec, will win large numbers of seats in the new
assembly, and that the well-armed government or the well-armed Khmer Rouge
will therefore refuse to accept the result; indeed, the Khmer Rouge has
already declared that it will reject the outcome.
The UN would then have to decide whether to change and strengthen Untac's
mandate so that UN forces may support a new government, or turn and run and
leave Cambodia's inhabitants to continue their civil war.
To abandon Cambodia could allow the Khmer Rouge ultimately to return to
power in Phnom Penh, risking a return of the killing fields and a new
confrontation on the border with Vietnam. It would also throw away such
gains as have been won by the peace accord - a fragile start to economic
growth, an enthusiasm for peace and democracy shown in the registration of
4.7m voters, and the nearly completed homecoming of some 370,000 refugees.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1994 US agriculture budget reduces programmes by 5.8 per cent below last
year's level but still leaves Dollars 63bn (Pounds 41.7bn) with which to
manage the nation's food supply, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Farm subsidies, Dollars 17bn in this year's budget, are supposed to shrink
to Dollars 12bn in 1994 if the weather, the Russians and the competition
co-operate. The Agriculture Department plans to limit payments to farmers
who earn less than Dollars 100,000 in off-farm income; this is expected to
save Dollars 75m this year and Dollars 470m in 1994-97.
The administration also proposes to save Dollars 12m this year by cutting
honey subsidies and Dollars 10m by limiting wool and mohair incentives.
Another Dollars 52.3m will be deleted from the 1994 market promotion
programme, which provides assistance in overseas promotions.
After 1995 the administration expects even larger savings by expanding from
15 to 25 per cent the acreage which will be ineligible for subsidies.
Other savings are expected through agency consolidations, charging user fees
and reforming the crop insurance programme.

FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Dollars 1m pay earners comb the fine print -
Salary curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration's plan to curb excessive executive pay by ending
the tax deductibility of salaries of more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 660,720)
will still leave companies considerable leeway.
The economic package published in February said salaries above Dollars 1m
could still be deducted if the pay were linked to the company's performance.
More detailed proposals published by the US Treasury this week show that
performance-linked pay would include not only commissions or other earnings
based directly on an executive's percentage of sales, but also any
compensation package based on performance standards approved by the
company's shareholders.
These standards would have to be set up by independent directors of the
company.
The ban on deductibility would affect only the chief executive and the four
other highest paid executives in a company - a limit which is expected to
help Wall Street firms that may have many more employees earning more than
Dollars 1m - and compensation plans already in place before the measure was
outlined on February 17 would also be exempted.
Compensation consultants appeared to be divided over how onerous the
proposal would be for companies, with much remaining to be determined by the
precise regulations that are eventually published to implement the measure.
Much may depend, for example, on how much detail the Treasury will require
companies to give shareholders before they vote on any compensation package.
President Clinton has said the measure is to encourage companies to examine
pay policies with the goal of helping 'shift business spending from excess
pay to investment'.

FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Spending reductions to hit manned missions
hardest - Space research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration has trimmed its
five-year spending plan by more than Dollars 15bn, to Dollars 80.4bn (Pounds
53.2bn), in a budget that shifts the focus from manned space flight towards
development of advanced technology for civilian use.
Nasa's Dollars 15.3bn 1994 budget request kills the National Launch System,
a controversial plan to create a new rocket that Mr Goldin said might cost
Dollars 10bn yet only permit the US to catch up with, and not leapfrog,
foreign competitors such as the European Ariane.
It also kills the Space Exploration Initiative, a long-term plan to send
humans back to the moon and to Mars.
The cancellations, along with changes in programmes such as the Cassini
probe to Saturn and the Earth Observation System, are expected to save more
than Dollars 6bn in 1994-98. Space shuttle funding will be cut by Dollars
3.4bn over the same period.
The biggest savings will come from the space station programme; exact cuts
will depend on the outcome of a fundamental redesign now under way, but
could halve the station's five-year cost to about Dollars 7.1bn.
Spending on aeronautics research, however, will be increased, with more
money going to development of a supersonic civilian aircraft. There will
also be increased funding of technology for subsonic long-haul aircraft and
for a hypersonic vehicle that could be ready to replace the shuttle by the
year 2005.

FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Rising trade deficit could cause friction - Risks
in economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery will result in a significant deterioration of the US
merchandise trade deficit, perhaps to a shortfall of as much as Dollars
140bn (Pounds 92.5bn) next year, according to White House projections.
A trade deficit of Dollars 140bn in fiscal 1994 would be the largest since
the record shortfall of Dollars 152bn in 1987. It was Dollars 84bn last
year.
A rise in the US trade shortfall could lead to increased trade friction,
especially with Japan.
The expected deterioration in the deficit (projected to fall in a range of
Dollars 110bn-Dollars 140bn in fiscal 1994) reflects White House projections
of economic growth of 3.1 per cent this year, rising to 3.3 per cent next
year.
The domestic counterpart to the widening trade deficit is a more rapid
increase in domestic investment than in domestic savings, reflecting planned
new incentives for business capital formation. The administration is
projecting net private investment next fiscal year of Dollars 190bn-Dollars
220bn compared with Dollars 102bn in fiscal 1992.
Economic growth is expected to slow to 2.7 per cent in 1995 and then
stabilise at 2.5 per cent a year from 1996 to 1998. Unemployment is expected
to fall steadily to 5.5 per cent in 1998. Inflation is projected to remain
at or close to 3 per cent through the next five years.
Officials stressed that the 'baseline' budget deficit projections were based
on the Congressional Budget Office's more conservative economic forecast.
This projects growth rising to a peak of 3 per cent next year and then
declining to 1.8 per cent by 1998, with inflation declining to 2.2 per cent.
On the White House's more optimistic forecasts, officials claimed the
deficit could fall as low as Dollars 160bn by fiscal 1997.
However, the figures make no allowance for the healthcare reform plan
expected next month. The restructuring of healthcare - nearly one seventh of
the economy - is likely to result in large increases in both spending and
taxes.
Democrats hailed Thursday's budget as the biggest deficit cutting programme
in US history. Yet the detailed figures show it would have only a modest
impact on the structural budget deficit, which allows for cyclical changes
in economic activity.
This would fall from Dollars 252.3bn this year to Dollars 205bn in fiscal
1994 and then climb to Dollars 241.2bn by fiscal 1998, or 3 per cent of
gross domestic product. The debt to GDP ratio would rise from 51 per cent
last year to 58 per cent in 1998.

THE US plans to pay off Dollars 98m (Pounds 64.9m) of its arrears with the
United Nations next year, with another Dollars 163m in 1995, to complete its
dues to the international organisation, writes George Graham.
The Clinton administration budget also proposes Dollars 620m for UN
peacekeeping operations in 1994, including Dollars 22m to pay off US arrears
and a Dollars 175m reserve for unanticipated needs. Another Dollars 293m is
allotted to pay for the peacekeeping force in Mozambique, already deployed
but not anticipated in last year's US budget. Including money set aside in
the defence budget, peacekeeping accounts for more than Dollars 1bn in the
overall fiscal 1994 budget.
Aid for Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union is increased to
Dollars 704m from Dollars 393m this year - although the package President
Bill Clinton announced in Vancouver last week included Dollars 1.6bn of
money previously allocated but not spent.
The bulk of the aid budget continues to go to Israel (Dollars 3bn) and Egypt
(Dollars 2.1bn).
The administration also proposes to pay the first of the three Dollars
1.25bn instalments it has pledged for the 10th replenishment of the
International Development Association, a World Bank offshoot which provides
loans at concessional rates to the poorest developing countries.

THE 1994 US agriculture budget reduces programmes by 5.8 per cent below last

Farm subsidies, Dollars 17bn in this year's budget, are supposed to shrink

The Agriculture Department plans to limit payments to farmers who earn less

75m this year and Dollars 470m in 1994-97. This assumes that farmers - who
have a record of creativity in avoiding payment limits - play along.
The administration also proposes to save Dollars 12m this year by cutting
honey subsidies and Dollars 10m by limiting wool and mohair incentives.
Another Dollars 52.3m will be deleted from the 1994 market promotion
programme, which provides assistance to trade organisations and private
companies in overseas promotional activities.
After 1995 the administration expects even larger savings by expanding from
15 to 25 per cent the acreage which will be ineligible for subsidies.
While increasing payments for food stamps and other programmes for the poor,
the Agriculture Department expects to save further through agency
consolidations, charging user fees, reforming the crop insurance programme,
and reducing the statistical output of the Economic Research Service.

<TEXT>
TRANSPORT spending will jump by 10 per cent next year if Mr Federico Pena,
transportation secretary, wins Congress's support for his Dollars 40.2bn
(Pounds 26.6bn) budget request, writes George Graham.
Although more than half the transport budget will still go to roads and
bridges, the administration's budget provides Dollars 4.6bn next year for
mass transit - 50 per cent more than the Bush administration requested last
year and 21 per cent higher than the even more generous allocation provided
by Congress. Much of the money will go towards new metro trains and safer,
cleaner buses.
'The past administration had an anti-transit bias. Our administration has a
pro-transit bias,' Mr Pena said.
High-speed rail technology and tracks, including development of a prototype
magnetic levitation train, are to get Dollars 1.3bn over five years,
starting with Dollars 140m in 1994.
The administration proposes to extend a 2.5 cents per gallon supplemental
petrol tax, currently earmarked for deficit reduction, until 1999 and shift
2 cents of it back to highway construction and 1/2 cent to transit.

FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Battle to meet Congress limits - Clinton
administration still needs to cut another Dollars 10bn of spending

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration faces a fight to cut another Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.6bn) of spending and raise a further Dollars 10bn in taxes in order to
squeeze its budget for next year inside limits set by Congress.
The administration published details of its Dollars 1,517bn budget for the
1994 fiscal year on Thursday but, in a reversal of the usual process,
Congress has already passed a budget resolution setting totals for revenues
and for broad categories of spending on the basis of the outline economic
plan President Bill Clinton presented in February.
Mr Clinton's detailed budget stays largely within those outlines: spending
shifts away from defence and government subsidies towards infrastructure
investment, civilian technology, training and education, while higher taxes
on companies, richer individuals and energy help to rein in the deficit.
'This plan hacks away at the deficit as a share of the economy, cutting it
by nearly one half from 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product in fiscal
1993 to 2.8 per cent in fiscal 1997,' said Mr Leon Panetta, budget director.
However, some of the totals have been adjusted slightly since February to
correct errors during, in Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's words, 'those
midnight sessions as you're running the computers.'
The administration's budget foresees spending dropping from Dollars 1,533bn
this year to Dollars 1,517bn in fiscal 1994, which will begin on October 1,
and then climbing to Dollars 1,820bn in 1998. Revenues are to rise from
Dollars 1,251bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,530.5bn in 1998.
This would allow the deficit to fall to Dollars 214bn in 1997 before
starting to rise again to Dollars 250bn in 1998.
The budget resolution passed by Congress, however, cuts spending by another
Dollars 44bn over the five-year period to reach Dollars 1,801bn in 1998,
while increasing revenues by another Dollars 27bn. It would trim the deficit
to Dollars 193bn in 1997 and Dollars 202bn in 1998.
Mr Panetta says the combination of the Clinton budget and Congress's
adjustments will reduce the deficit by a total of Dollars 514bn over five
years, compared with the levels it would have reached if no action were
taken.
The programme will raise about Dollars 328bn in new taxes over five years,
mostly from lifting the top personal income tax rates from 31 per cent to 36
per cent for single taxpayers with a taxable income above Dollars 115,000
and to 39.6 per cent for incomes above Dollars 250,000. The corporate income
tax rate would also rise to 36 per cent for companies with taxable income
above Dollars 10m.
A new energy tax will be levied at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British
thermal units on most forms of energy, or 59.9 cents per million BTUs on oil
products. Most renewable fuels, including ethanol, will be exempt, and home
heating oil will be taxed only at the basic 25.7 cent rate.
Spending will rise on programmes such as roadbuilding, Head Start classes
for pre-school children and government research in civilian technologies
such as aeronautics, magnetic levitation trains and materials science.

FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Savings to hit manned missions - Nasa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration has trimmed its
five-year spending plan by more than Dollars 15bn, to Dollars 80.4bn (Pounds
53.2bn), in a budget that shifts the focus from manned space flight towards
development of advanced technology for civilian use.
'It simply was not feasible for us to continue spending at the rate we were
and not delivering what we had to deliver,' said Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa's
administrator.
Nasa's Dollars 15.3bn 1994 budget request kills the National Launch System,
a controversial plan to create a new rocket that Mr Goldin said might cost
Dollars 10bn yet only permit the US to catch up with, and not leapfrog,
foreign competitors such as the European Ariane.
It also kills the Space Exploration Initiative, a long-term plan to send
humans back to the moon and to Mars.
The cancellations, along with changes in programmes such as the Cassini
probe to Saturn and the Earth Observation System, are expected to save more
than Dollars 6bn in 1994-98. Space shuttle funding will be cut by Dollars
3.4bn over the same period.
The biggest savings will come from the space station programme; exact cuts
will depend on the outcome of a fundamental redesign now under way, but
could halve the station's five-year cost to about Dollars 7.1bn.
Spending on aeronautics research, however, will be increased, with more
money going to development of a supersonic civilian aircraft. Nasa believes
there could be a market for 500-1,000 of the craft by the turn of the
century. There will also be increased funding of technology for subsonic
long-haul aircraft and for a hypersonic vehicle that could be ready to
replace the shuttle by the year 2005.

<TEXT>
A US safety agency yesterday asked General Motors to recall millions of
pick-up trucks to correct an allegedly dangerous positioning of petrol
tanks, Reuter reports from Washington.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to the
company that an agency study showed there was a 2.4 times greater risk of
fire occurring in fatal side-impact crashes involving the GM vehicle than in
similar sized Ford pick-up trucks.
Consumer groups that have advocated a recall have said the safety problem
affects 4.7m 1973-1987 model trucks.
GM said it disagreed with the agency's request and would try to demonstrate
to it that a recall of trucks was unwarranted.

Poland's coalition government, led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, faces a reshuffle
and possible shift to the left, following the resignation of Mr Gabriel
Janowski, agriculture minister, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw.
Mr Janowski quit after the government brushed aside his ministry's
recommendations on minimum grain prices. He attacked cabinet colleagues for
failing to support his efforts to develop agriculture.
About 40 per cent of Poles live or work in the countryside and the rural
vote is important.
Leaders of Mr Janowski's party will meet next week to decide whether to
withdraw from the coalition. If they pull out, Ms Suchocka may turn to the
left-leaning PSL farmers' party.
Reuter adds: Poland's secret service have foiled a plot to kill President
Lech Walesa, a spokeswoman for the service said yesterday.

An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle has led the EC to stumble
into the first tit-for-tat trade conflict with its east European associated
members, Nicholas Denton writes from Budapest.
The EC Commission this week imposed a one-month ban on imports of live
animals, meat, milk and dairy products from eastern Europe. EC officials
said the measure was aimed at preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth from
the region.
Hungary, the country most affected by the EC move with forecast losses of up
to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m), retaliated with its own prohibition on
imports and transit of EC products.

FT  10 APR 93 / Pragmatism tempers Balladur's grandiose plans: The policy
'reforms' outlined by France's new premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN a relatively self-effacing Frenchman sees his country as a model for
Europe, not to say the world, to follow - and Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur was not shy in making l'exemple francais the theme of his new
government's programme.
But in his policy speech to parliament on Thursday he wisely tempered his
ambitions with a warning to the conservative majority sitting in front of
him that his 'reforms' might take five years to bear fruit, rather than the
two years which may, in reality, be all he has.
In 1995 France will go through the upheaval of a presidential election,
which may prompt new parliamentary polls and - depending on Mr Balladur's
record - a new premier.
Mr Balladur himself gave more reason for prudence than pretension. He
claimed France faces 'its most serious economic and social situation' since
it emerged from the second world war. This could be taken as a politically
convenient depreciation of the legacy left him by the Socialists, were it
not for the premier's deep pessimism about any rapid improvement in
unemployment.
Putting people back to work is the government's 'absolute priority', he
said. But he only allowed himself the hope that the jobless rate, 10.6 per
cent in February, 'which will continue to rise inexorably this year, should
stabilise at the end of 1993, and start to fall thereafter'.
This is despite Mr Balladur's plan to ease the welfare charges which fall on
employers' payroll costs. Indeed, in tackling unemployment Mr Balladur
suggested the world might be able to teach France something; his new
advisory committee on unemployment will include foreign as well as French
experts.
Yet, on the issue of immigration, France's new government clearly does not
want any lecturing from outside.
Mr Balladur made clear that the 25,000 expulsions of illegal immigrants
ordered every year by French courts would be carried out, and that the
100,000 people born of immigrant parents on French soil who every year
acquire French nationality automatically on their 18th birthday would now
have to affirm their interest in a French passport.
By being tougher on illegal immigrants the government believes it can be
kinder to legal ones. But this week's violent racial incidents in Paris and
Lille have cast fresh doubt on improvements in racial integration - an issue
on which the French have never been slow to moralise to the rest of the
world.
It is in foreign policy that the new French government's 'exemplary'
ambitions are most obvious. In his one surprise initiative Mr Balladur
called for a conference to settle the post-cold war conflicts which have
broken out in Europe, in the way that the peace conferences of 1815, 1919-20
and 1945 brought other European wars to an end.
More seriously, Mr Balladur has now been as categoric as he possibly can be
in endorsing the franc's present parity with the D-Mark. As the only way to
move Europe forward to monetary union in the long term and France forward to
resumed economic growth in the short term, maintenance of the link with the
D-Mark was 'a national objective', he said.
Such firmness, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, claimed
yesterday, had already paid off in the 1.5 percentage point drop in money
market rates since the conservative election victory. This may in turn lead
the Bank of France to reduce its upper, emergency lending rate, currently at
12 per cent, next week.
But because his economic policy depends crucially on Bundesbank interest
rate cuts for its success, Mr Balladur issued a thinly veiled warning to
Bonn that it, too, had to try to pursue a balanced budgetary and fiscal
policy if France and Germany were to keep their economies and currencies
together.
Mr Balladur evidently reckoned he was setting an example in confirming he
would raise indirect taxes and cut an immediate FFr20bn (Pounds 2.41bn) off
a budget deficit which he estimated would grow to FFr330bn this year, or 3.4
per cent of national output. If allowed five years at the helm, Mr Balladur
promised to get this down to 2.5 per cent by 1997. But the current size of
the budget's deficit made Mr Balladur's side-swipe at the European
Commission's 'budgetary skids' somewhat ironic.
In defence, where his Gaullist RPR party has for so long been dogmatic, Mr
Balladur raised more questions than answers. At this stage he could only be
clear that France would keep up its military guard (nuclear and
conventional), that it would give itself the means to dispatch troops
'wherever they are needed in the world,' and that, with revamped armed
forces, France would be 'the driving force of a true European defence
entity, set up in close co-operation with our American friends and allies'.
Clearly, France's rivalry with the US will henceforth be more commercial
than military.

FT  10 APR 93 / Industrial sales drop as recession takes its toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry's sales in January tumbled 13.5 per cent, compared with the
equivalent month last year, as recession and winter took their toll.
Total turnover in manufacturing and mining fell to DM141bn (Pounds 57.6bn)
and numbers employed dropped by 8.5 per cent (or 723,000) to 7.8m, according
to the federal statistics office. Export sales were 17.5 per cent lower than
a year earlier, at DM35bn.
The extent of the fall underlines the sharpening industrial crisis, which
last week led Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest concern, to forecast a renewed
profits fall this year of up to 30 per cent.
The contraction in Germany's industrial output during the month was
accelerated by widespread short-time working, especially in the automotive
industry. Continuation of short-time in subsequent months is likely to have
had a similar effect on production and turnover in February and March.
The continuing collapse in east Germany was highlighted by figures showing
only 775,000 people at work in production industries during January, 29 per
cent fewer than a year earlier. They generated total sales of a mere
DM6.5bn, down 7 per cent. Export turnover fell almost 19 per cent to just
DM700m.
In the west, where industrial sales dropped 13.7 per cent, export turnover
was down more than 17 per cent at DM34bn. There were sharp falls in all
industrial sectors, the statistics office said. Numbers employed were down
409,000 or 5.5 per cent.

FT  10 APR 93 / IG Metall hints at deal to avert strike in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, yesterday hinted it might accept a
compromise with employers if it meant averting an all-out strike in eastern
Germany. But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall's president, warned that all
demands of the steel, metal and electrical employers' associations could not
be met.
The employers have already recommended pay increases of 9 per cent this year
for eastern Germany's steel, electrical and metal sectors. This is instead
of rises of up to 26 per cent agreed in March 1991 under a contract that
envisaged bringing east German wages up to west German levels by April 1994.
The employers, invoking a revision clause, pulled out of that contract last
month on the grounds of deteriorating economic circumstances.
Mr Steinkuhler, in a pre-recorded radio interview, said his union would be
prepared to accept 'a compromise which might hurt'. Although he did not give
details, he said eastern Germany would have 'wage contracts with many
companies but there will no longer be one broad wage contract'. Some large
companies in eastern Germany, notably Opel, are already outside IG Metall's
wage structure.
Meanwhile, Mr Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister, who is increasingly
concerned about the impact of a strike on unemployment levels in eastern
Germany, has proposed introduction of a new wage system. He said wage
increases could be linked to a profit-related pay scheme.

IRAQI anti-aircraft guns yesterday fired on four US aircraft patrolling in

Pentagon officials said the F-16 fighters had dropped bombs on the Iraqi
anti-aircraft battery and returned to their base in Turkey without damage.
The Iraqi news agency reported an Iraqi soldier was wounded.
Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the US remained
committed to enforcing both the northern no-fly zone declared by the UN in
1991 to protect the Kurds from Iraqi hostilities and the similar southern
zone intended to protect the mainly Shi'ite marsh Arabs.
The clash is the first involving the US since the day of President Bill
Clinton's inauguration on January 20, when US planes bombed an Iraqi radar
considered to be threatening a French Mirage aircraft.

FT  10 APR 93 / Warrant triggers a war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Fiat, the Italian vehicle manufacturer, and the Milan
magistrates investigating alleged political corruption have deteriorated
ahead of the expected return to Italy next week of Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, the
company's chief operating officer.
Magistrates issued a warrant on Wednesday for the arrest of Mr Garuzzo,
former managing director of Fiat's Iveco truck and bus subsidiary, who is in
London. The move was in connection with alleged kickbacks on purchases of
Iveco buses by the Milan municipality.
Mr Piercamillo Davigo, one of the magistrates conducting inquiries, said the
problem of arrests of leading businessmen would be resolved 'the day Fiat
stops paying kickbacks or behaving in a way which allows them to be paid'.
His comments were in response to a statement from Mr Garuzzo on Wednesday
night that he had offered to testify before magistrates last week and had
been turned down. 'I can only think that, as has happened to a number of
people recently, the Italian investigating authorities prefer to hear from
persons after they have been arrested,' he said.
The arrest and imprisonment of suspects has been criticised by some lawyers,
who claim indiscriminate prison spells have been used to extract confessions
and implicate individuals.
The Milan magistrates' tough response suggests there will be confrontation
when Mr Garuzzo returns to Italy after Easter. In a statement from its Turin
headquarters after the warrant was issued, Fiat said it was 'preoccupied' by
the affair.
Separately, Naples magistrates requesting parliamentary permission to
investigate five prominent local politicians are believed to have identified
Mr Antonio Gava, a leading Christian Democrat senator and former minister,
as the central figure in alleged links with organised crime.
The allegations stem from leaked details of a 200-page document sent by
magistrates to parliament outlining the allegations, which are based on
testimony from a local boss of the Camorra criminal organisation who is now
co-operating with the authorities.
Mr Claudio Moreno, the Italian ambassador to Argentina, has been arrested on
charges of involvement with corruption and kickbanks in Italy's aid
programme to developing countries.
Mr Moreno is the third senior diplomat to be arrested by Rome magistrates
following the earlier detentions of Mr Giuseppe Santoro, former head of the
aid programme, and Mr Michele Martinez, ambassador to Indonesia.

FT  10 APR 93 / Rome plans to accelerate state sell-offs: Amato government's
signals help bolster lira and shares
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government plans to accelerate its ambitious privatisation
programme and push sales into public services and parts of the energy
sector.
The new proposals, amplifying plans presented last November, imply that the
four parties in Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's coalition government have
reached some agreement on remaining in office beyond crucial referendums on
April 18.
However, in view of the unpredictable political climate in Rome and the
ambitious timetable, the plans may still be vulnerable to change or delay.
The privatisation announcement, and a modified scheme for private pension
funds also unveiled by ministers, helped restore confidence in the lira and
shares. The currency has firmed to L972 against the D-Mark, while shares
made further modest gains yesterday after steep climbs on Thursday.
The revised privatisation proposals, to be put to parliament next week, are
an amplification of previous policy rather than a totally new strategy.
The biggest change is the commitment to sell most of the Eni energy and
chemicals group. Previously the government had focused on the flotation of
some subsidiaries, while the future of the parent company remained unclear.
Other innovations include a pledge to sell Enel, the electricity generating
authority, possibly next year, and to reduce the state's role in the
fragmented telecommunications sector.
Last week a cabinet committee called for the creation of a single telecoms
utility by 1994-1995. The government has now confirmed earlier hints that
simplifying the telecoms structure will be the prelude to cutting the
state's stake.
The draft timetable is extremely ambitious, with many deals scheduled before
year-end. However, ministers recognised possible delays by talking in terms
of when companies would be 'ready for the market,' rather than sold.
Apart from sending a political signal to the electorate and the financial
markets that Mr Amato is still in control, the decision to speed sell-offs
may also have been influenced by international competition. The new
government in France and Chancellor Kohl's coalition in Germany are expected
to produce substantial privatisation packages soon.
International investors are expected to play a big part in the sell-offs, as
liquidity on the Milan stock market is limited. Foreign multinationals may
be the only buyers for some of the smaller or more specialised assets.
A single bank will be appointed to mastermind each privatisation, although
other banks will conduct valuations and additional advisory work. However,
the sale of public-sector monopolies such as telecommunications or
electricity still needs considerable preparation. Tariffs will have to be
liberalised and the government intends to create a number of watchdog
'authorities' to supervise pricing and services.
Later, privatisation may even be extended into such areas as the postal
service, which is to be transformed into a joint stock company.

<TEXT>
AS HE LAUNCHES his fight to win a referendum just two weeks away, President
Boris Yeltsin symbolises Russia's tragic dependence throughout the centuries
on a 'good tsar' to bring well-being to the people.
Three hundred years ago Peter the Great first launched the westernising
reforms Mr Yeltsin is trying to carry forward. In post-communist Russia, Mr
Yeltsin is widely seen as the guarantor of what little stability there is,
as well as the basis for a strong executive needed to push through market
reforms.
But the 62-year-old leader's performance at the height of the crisis at the
last Congress of People's Deputies session, when he appeared dishevelled and
mixed up his words, was a reminder of the dangers of the country relying so
heavily on one individual, as it has done so often in its history.
Ministers watched in embarrassed disbelief, deputies laughed, his
arch-rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the parliament, smirked,
and even impartial foreign observers wondered whether he was ill or
inebriated.
In the campaign for the referendum that will ask Russians whether they trust
him, Mr Yeltsin is telling the people that he is the only available defence
against restoration of communist dictatorship.
Mr Khasbulatov claimed yesterday that, on the contrary, Mr Yeltsin was
trying to build a dictatorship because he had exhausted the legal basis for
radical reforms.
Launching his own referendum campaign, Mr Khasbulatov called on local
councils - the lower levels of legislative power in Russia - to mobilise
support against an executive he described as a 'collective Rasputin'. The
reference is to Grigory Rasputin, the monk whose influence on Tsar Nicholas
II is cited as one of the reasons for the collapse of the monarchy and the
70 years of bolshevism which followed.
But despite siding with Mr Yeltsin, many supporters of radical reforms are
upset by his confrontational style, saying he has driven the country into a
needless all-or-nothing gamble.
'He is supposed to guarantee this (reform) process. I don't want him to put
everything on the brink like this,' says Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent
economist who has already announced his intention to run for president when
Mr Yeltsin steps down.
But Mr Yavlinsky, who argues that Mr Yeltsin could have mounted a less
dangerous defence against parliament's attempts to cut his powers, draws
some comfort from the fact that reformers like himself are preparing for the
succession, as it were. 'I want to unite positive forces so that communists
and nationalists do not take over.'
Another presidential hopeful is said to be Mr Yuri Shafranik, fuel and
energy minister and former governor of the oil-producing Tyumen region.
For the moment, however, all eyes are focused on Mr Yeltsin, with reformers
saying he is their best hope for keeping the country together and pursuing
further reforms.
Economic reform, meanwhile, has taken a back seat to populist promises to
win votes in the referendum. Mr Yeltsin last week decreed a doubling of
wages for state employees, and yesterday reversed a doubling of petrol
prices which has infuriated motorists.

FT  10 APR 93 / Inflation slowdown helps US revival plan
</HEADLINE>

THE US economy received a boost yesterday from official figures showing a
sharp slowing of inflation last month.
The Commerce Department said the underlying or 'core' consumer price index
rose only 0.1 per cent compared with increases of 0.5 per cent in both
January and February. This followed news on Thursday of a parallel easing of
wholesale price inflation last month. The previous apparent increase in
inflationary pressures had stalled a decline in US bond market interest
rates after sharp price rises earlier this year.
The figures came the day after release of the administration's budget for
fiscal 1994, an elaboration of the economic plan unveiled in February.
Mr Clinton plans to finance deficit reduction and higher federal investment
in areas such as infrastructure and training with sharp cuts in defence
spending, higher income taxes on the wealthiest 1 per cent and a new
broad-based energy levy.
The budget projects a decline in the deficit from Dollars 322bn (Pounds
211.8bn) this fiscal year to Dollars 264.1bn in fiscal 1994, which begins on
October 1, and Dollars 214bn in fiscal 1997.

FT  10 APR 93 / Serbs say UN aid in Bosnia can continue: Canadian troops
will not be allowed into Srebrenica to end siege of town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS officials appeared yesterday to have succeeded in maintaining
the flow of aid in Bosnia after urgent talks with Serb leaders.
The talks in Belgrade followed the discovery by Serb soldiers on Thursday of
smuggled ammunition on board a UN relief truck delivering aid to a Moslem
area of Sarajevo.
Last night Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, promised that
shipments would continue to flow, although 'it is obvious that we have to
make detailed inspections of convoys'.
Meanwhile, General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army,
yesterday said Canadian UN troops would not be allowed to enter Srebrenica
as part of an effort by General Philippe Morillon to end the Serbian siege
of the town.
Speaking after meeting UN military chiefs in Belgrade, General Mladic said
the 120 Canadians could only enter the eastern Bosnian town, which they have
been trying to reach for three days, 'over my dead body, or the bodies of my
family'. During the talks on the flow of aid, General Lars-Erik Walhgren,
commander of the UN force in former Yugoslavia, expressed his 'dismay and
regret' at the use of the convoy by unnamed parties to smuggle ammunition.
General Walhgren said he had asked Bosnian Serb military forces to help in
an investigation into the issue. Earlier, some Bosnian Serb officials had
threatened to ban the passage of aid convoys if more smuggled arms were
found.
Any prolonged disruption of the convoy system would call into question the
survival of the Tuzla enclave, the biggest stronghold of the Bosnian
government and main destination for the thousands of refugees fleeing the
siege of nearby Srebrenica.
Once a major industrial centre of former Yugoslavia, Tuzla's population of
125,000 has increased by half with refugees, mostly from eastern Bosnia.
Refugees make up 25 per cent of the 850,000 population of the whole Tuzla
enclave, which includes parts of central Bosnia under nominal governmental
control.
The city itself is nearly cut off by Serb forces, while Croat troops
occasionally take control of the narrow dirt road, the only open route to
the city.
Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, a top official of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, said Tuzla's authorities had performed 'miracles' in coping with
the influx of refugees. But he conceded that 'we cannot supply the city with
food indefinitely. The Croats must be pressured to stop the continuing
harassment and halting of aid to Tuzla'. Some 80 per cent of food aid was
delivered through Serb lines from Belgrade, he added. Plans to bring another
convoy of refugees out of Srebrenica today are reported to have been
postponed, but officials in Tuzla can expect little permanent relief from
the flood of refugees from the besieged town. Conditions in Tuzla are
spartan, but the town has been spared the destruction of Srebrenica and the
refugees are happy to be in its relative security.
Clutching her frail two-year-old daughter, Mrs Azreta Habibovic yesterday
described her exodus from Srebrenica. 'The Serbs threw stones at us in
Zvornik. They screamed and one woman was badly hurt,' she said. 'But
anything was worth getting out of there. The Serbs are shelling all of the
time. It is hell.'
More divisions appeared yesterday in the international effort to force
Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Belgrade to accept the Vance-Owen peace
plan for Bosnia after Russia said tighter sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro
would be counter-productive.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: WMC tries to leave the worst of
bad weeks behind it - How a judge's ruling in Nova Scotia has affected the
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THIRD week of December 1987 is one which Western Mining (WMC), the
Australian resources group, would prefer to forget.
Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director, had a punishing schedule during that week
as he pursued several acquisitions aimed at giving WMC a secure foothold in
the North American mining industry.
None of the assets that WMC bought in its Dollars 450m shopping expedition
has turned into a producing mine. A judge in Nova Scotia has severely
criticised the 'callous disregard' with which WMC handled one of the
takeovers.
Mr Justice Merlin Nunn ordered WMC to pay damages and costs, expected to
exceed CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.7m), to the president and six former
directors of Seabright Resources, one of the targets of the 1987 acquisition
spree. WMC will appeal.
Seabright was an ambitious Nova Scotia exploration company, boasting in
mid-1987 that it was becoming 'one of Canada's greatest gold producers'. It
aimed to have four mines in operation by 1989.
A promising area appeared to be a deposit known as Beaver Dam. Studies
pointed to large reserves and a high grade. But in the months leading up to
WMC's takeover offer in December 1987, doubts began to surface.
News of these doubts reached WMC after the CDollars 92m deal to buy
Seabright was completed in February 1988. Within three weeks, a WMC official
was describing Beaver Dam as 'just bloody hopeless'. A year later, WMC
halted Seabright's operations and wrote off its investment.
WMC sued Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, for fraud, negligence
and insider trading. It levelled similar allegations against the other
directors. However, Mr Coughlan and his colleagues counter-sued the
Australian company with allegations ranging from abuse of process, to a
malicious conspiracy to deprive them of indemnity insurance coverage.
Upholding the directors' claims, the Nova Scotia court ruled in essence that
WMC failed to do adequate homework on Seabright in its eagerness to cloak
its intentions and to shut out competitive bids.
According to the judge, the WMC team 'cannot deny there was public
information to alert them that there were problems, as they were aware of
sampling problems, they were aware that Beaver Dam had suffered a setback
and that Seabright, through Coughlan, was over-promotional and lacking the
technical skills necessary'.
He said there was no evidence to suggest any intention among the Seabright
directors to commit fraud. They gave the impression of being reluctant
sellers.
The judge was scathing about WMC's conduct after it discovered it had made a
disappointing investment. He said the Australian company acted 'with callous
disregard of the rights of (Mr Coughlan and the other Seabright directors)
and a determination to cause them injury'.
Although Mr Coughlan and a Seabright vice-president remained on the payroll
for some time after the takeover, WMC never asked about nor confronted them
with any of the information offered as evidence during the trial.
The judge also criticised WMC for serving its original claim on the
directors one day after the expiry of their indemnity insurance, without
providing advance warning to the insurer. 'The intention to sue was known,
the existence of the policy was known, and copies of the policy were in
hand,' he said.
Noting that 'the predominant purpose of (WMC's) litigation was to injure (Mr
Coughlan and his colleagues),' the judge said that they 'have been
grievously injured in their reputation at large in the business community
and in their personal lives.' Hence his decision to award substantial
damages.
The judgment raises wider questions about the secrecy and single-mindedness
with which such deals are pursued.
The judge dismissed much of Mr Morgan's evidence as unreliable, but noted
that his lapses were perhaps understandable in view of his hectic travel
schedule that week and his failure to keep notes.
The money involved is relatively small, but the judgment is a blow to WMC,
not least because it draws attention to a period described by Mr Morgan as
one in which the group's 'toe was stubbed'.
When it embarked on its North American spending spree, WMC had cash reserves
of ADollars 370m (USDollars 264.3m), backed by ADollars 840m from a
successful rights issue. The gold market was rising and the global stock
markets' collapse in October 1987 left the group well-placed to pick up
bargains for cash.
The collapse of its North American strategy was a blow to WMC. It has begun
to flex its muscles again, notably through the USDollars 240m purchase from
BP of the 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam copper/uranium/gold/silver mine it
did not own.
The group's share price has risen since the Canadian judgment, suggesting
the Seabright debacle is regarded by investors as old news. Mr Morgan will
be hoping it stays that way.

FT  08 APR 93 / Mitsubishi and Aiwa to expand in S E Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Motors, the car manufacturer, and Aiwa, the electronics
manufacturer, are to increase production in south-east Asia. The
announcement yesterday highlights a trend among Japanese companies to move
production to the region.
Mitsubishi Motors said it would expand capacity at its plants in Malaysia
and Thailand, while Aiwa said it would increase investment in Malaysia and
Singapore.
The moves reflect the two companies' expectations of substantial growth in
the south-east Asian market in coming years. However, it will also help both
companies overcome pressures on their profits. Their industries have been
most severely hurt by the domestic Japanese slump and the rise of the yen.
Mitsubishi is expanding annual capacity in Malaysia from 120,000 to 150,000
vehicles. In Thailand, it is plannig to raise capacity from 30,000 to
100,000 by 1995.
Aiwa, which expects to see pre-tax profits fall by 40-50 per cent in the
year to March, is planning to increase production in Singapore where it will
expand its three factories.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Solvay sees another difficult
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, yesterday warned that its earnings
would slump again this year as the European economy continues to
deteriorate.
The group proposed holding its net dividend at BFr500 per share, the same as
in 1990 and 1991.
Solvay said net consolidated profits fell 16.5 per cent in 1992, to
BFr9.76bn (Dollars 293m) from BFr11.7bn in 1991. Stripping out extraordinary
gains, profits fell to BFr8.41bn from BFr9.79bn, a drop of 14 per cent, as
announced in January amid preliminary 1992 figures.
'The first half of this year should . . . prove to be particularly
difficult,' the company said.
Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay's chairman, warned the group would have to cut
further jobs in 1993, in addition to the 1,700 lost last year, mainly
through early retirement.
Mr Janssen underlined that the group was continuing its investment programme
to reinforce its fundamental strengths.
Competition in Europe took its toll on alkalis and plastics. Earnings before
interest, taxes and charges slipped to BFr5.6bn from BFr6.13bn in alkalis,
and to BFr90m from BFr1.7bn in plastics. Earnings from peroxygens rose to
BFr3.06bn from BFr2.75bn, health products to BFr2.97bn from BFr2.24bn, while
earnings in the processing sector slipped to BFr2.18bn from BFr2.29bn.
Overall sales were steady at BFr254bn and net earnings slipped to BFr1,177
per share from BFr1,410.
Tractebel, the Belgian utilities group, pushed up net consolidated profits
to BFr27bn from BFr25.7bn. The group has proposed a 3.1 per cent increase in
net dividends to BFr330 (BFr320) per share.
Tractebel's principal subsidiary is Electrabel, Belgium's largest company by
market capitalisation. Some 41 per cent of Tractebel is in turn owned by
Societe Generale de Belgique, which announces its 1992 results today.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Struggle to maintain cutting
edge - Problems in Germany's machine-tool industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Traub and Maho, two of Germany's biggest machine tool companies,
announced a global strategic alliance last year, rivals faced the prospect
of an important new force operating in the recession-battered European
market.
The deal took effect on January 1, and appeared sound. The marketing tie-up
between Traub, a big producer of turning centres or lathes, and Maho, which
makes milling machines, would help them both fend off Japanese competition.
'We had to increase our product range to offer a complete package,' says Mr
Paul Maynard, managing director of Traub UK and a member of the Traub
management board.
Little more than two months later, however, the co-operation agreement has
been dissolved. On the rebound, Traub has announced a new alliance with
Hermle, a specialist German milling machine producer that depends on Germany
for nearly 80 per cent of its sales.
The chain of events would be extraordinary for any industry. For German
machine tool companies, always reticent to co-operate with each other and
even more cautious about announcing anything, it is unprecedented and deeply
embarrassing.
It underlines with particular force the problems of the German machine tool
industry, which is by far the largest in Europe. As the British machine tool
industry perceives better times ahead, domestic orders in Germany are
running at about half the level of a year ago, producers say.
After years of growth which many German machine tool companies believed
would continue unabated, the market - second biggest in the world after
Japan - has dropped in about nine months as far as its UK counterpart did in
two years. According to American Machinist figures, consumption of machine
tools fell nearly 17 per cent last year to Dollars 5.03bn. Confidence among
domestic customers has fallen dramatically, and the machine tool makers are
saddled with high labour costs and gearing. Overseas, the east European
market, where Germany dominated western imports, has virtually dried up.
The problem that has bedevilled the UK machine tool industry during the past
two years of recession is now beginning to surface in Germany: withdrawal of
financial support as banks lose their patience.
In March, Hahn und Kolb, the big Stuttgart-based machine tool sales and
service company, was forced to apply for protection from its creditors
because of liquidity bottlenecks caused by lower turnover.
To make things worse, German machine tool companies have found it much
harder to cut jobs than have their UK counterparts. Traub began retrenching
relatively early, but even so its workforce has been cut from about 3,000 in
1991 to about 2,000. Hermle has cut its staff by one-third to 500.
Traub, family-controlled but publicly-quoted, is relatively strong outside
Germany, deriving 45 to 50 per cent of sales abroad, but its managing board
chairman, Mr Hans-Dieter Potsch, decided 18 months ago that it needed to be
internationally stronger, to compete with Japanese rivals.
'We needed to attack the Pacific basin market, where the Japanese are
selling machines for 10 to 20 per cent more than in Europe and the US,' says
Mr Maynard.
After talks with a number of companies, including Hermle and, it is
believed, some foreign companies, Traub publicised its deal with Maho in
December.
A merger was never likely because of Maho's financial condition; it lost
DM159m in 1991-92. German banks took effective control of the company last
year, and its former chairman and moving force, Mr Werner Babel, has seen
his family's majority shareholding cut to a minority stake.
It appears that Maho was not meeting its financial targets, although details
about the collapse of the deal have not been divulged.
A further loss of DM45m is expected this year and Maho told Traub that the
need for more restructuring may harm the co-operation agreement.
Mr Maynard says Traub is sorry about the decision, but he is putting a on
brave face. Some of Hermle's specialist machines are better than Maho's, he
says, although they will require heavier marketing.
The new deal appears to make sense for both companies. Hermle, which went
public in 1990, will benefit from Traub's international marketing muscle.
Traub gets access to a new range of milling machines to add to its recent
acquisitions in France and Italy.
As for Maho, rumours continue regarding a link-up with its rival Deckel. The
companies are known to have been discussing co-operating in manufacturing,
but recent speculation suggests they may be contemplating a full merger.
German machine tool companies have traditionally considered that a step too
far. But then they have never had to cope with conditions like today's.

FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays closes the book on an unhappy chapter: John Gapper
reports on how the UK bank hopes to avoid the lending mistakes of the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The senior Barclays executive in charge of approving many of the poor loans
which led to a Pounds 242m (Dollars 367m) pre-tax loss at the UK bank last
year is to leave.
Barclays said yesterday that Mr Mark Deverell, 52, the director of risk
management, had 'agreed to leave'. The bank is also announcing today a new
structure to control and balance its lending. The reforms include the
breaking-up of the 'central advances department' which Mr Deverell headed.
Mr Deverell, former chief executive of Barclays' subsidiary in Australia,
took over risk management in 1989. The property lending which contributed to
Pounds 1.96bn provisions for UK bad debts last year rose rapidly in 1989 and
1990.
Barclays' management has faced sustained criticism by investors. Mr Andrew
Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, has announced that it will
appoint a new chief executive from outside the bank this year.
The bank will disclose its new structure for controlling risk - along with
Mr Deverell's departure from May - to its managers today. It has appointed
Mr Brown, 47, and formerly chief executive of Barclays in Japan, to take
charge as director of group credit policy.
Mr Brown said he intended to reduce lending to property, construction and
hotel companies. He said executives had been too rushed by the growth of
loans in the late 1980s to balance the lending properly.
'We undoubtedly feel that we were too aggressive in that period. That means
you take on business at a speed which makes your executives so busy that
they cannot be as thorough as they could be before,' said Mr Brown.
He says the balance of loans was distorted towards property, construction
and hotels because the 500 managers and staff under Mr Deverell were
swamped: 'We had the classic business dilemma of choosing between things
that are important and things that are urgent. The balance was wrong.'
Barclays' past lending errors can be seen by comparing its portfolio and
provisions with those of National Westminster, the second largest British
bank by assets. The banks have lent in roughly the same proportions to most
sectors, but Barclays has much more exposure to property and construction.
Barclays was always strong in property and construction. But the two sectors
proved far more risky than in the past. Together, they accounted for only
11.9 per cent of its loan book last year. But 38 per cent of its Pounds
1.96bn provision against UK lending in the UK related to them.
A second problem was over the approval and monitoring of individual loans.
Each loan of more than Pounds 5m was approved by at least one executive in
CAD, and monitored by the bank's risk management committee. This comprised
senior directors and executives which reviewed bad debts and exposures.
Mr Brown says that this committee - despite the emphasis placed on it in
Barclays' annual report - met infrequently.
'They did not meet on individual loans unless there was a special reason.
They passed the proposition around. The first person signed, and then the
second, and so on,' he says. 'There was a danger that because the first
person said yes, so did the others.'
Under Barclays' new structure - which will be put in place this month -
there will be three changes.
The first is that Mr Brown will head new 'group credit policy unit' which
will monitor exposures and balancing the portfolio. Mr Brown says this means
there will be a smaller proportion of property lending, as well as shifts in
country exposure, and the re-pricing of loans in some other lending areas.
'We have still got a big business here. We are not talking about dumping
whole categories of customers, but of lightening the load in certain areas,'
he says.
He expects that over two years, the bank will be able to rebalance its
portfolio to match a new computer model of credit risk it is developing.
The model is expected to be applied to all but the smallest loans within a
year. It rates risk according to factors such as industry sector, company
size and history, and financial information.
Barclays has drawn it up using data on large loans dating back six years in
the UK.
The second change is that the loan approval responsibility of the CAD will
be broken up. Instead, there will be separate risk management departments
within the banking and investment banking divisions. This is intended to
give a greater sense of responsibility for loans to those who make them.
All loans which would have had to be approved within the CAD previously will
be allocated to a single 'responsible executive' within the line divisions.
This executive - drawn from a group of about 150 around the world - will
have to follow each loan through to the end.
The third change is that the rarely-meeting risk management committee is
being scrapped, and a 'group credit committee' will be put in its place.
This will be chaired by Mr Humphrey Norrington, a vice chairman of Barclays,
and will meet daily to discuss individual exposures of above Pounds 150m.
Will this new scrutiny leave a bank that just looks like all the rest? Mr
Brown says it wants to remain distinctive, but its traditions will be under
scrutiny. 'Where we are different, we will want to have asked ourselves why
in a diligent, professional manner,' he says.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: French insurer dragged down by
Baltica stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE VICTOIRE, the French insurer, yesterday announced an 88 per cent
plunge in net profits to FFr214m (Dollars 39.6m) last year from FFr1.8bn in
1991. It was dragged down by its stake in Baltica, the troubled Danish
insurance company.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Victoire as well as of the Suez group to which
the insurance company is linked, forecast that 'the 1993 profit will be
clearly above that of 1992, but not at the level of 1991'.
Baltica, in which Victoire has a 23.7 per cent stake, has hit problems in
its property and banking activities, and it accounted for about FFr1bn of
the French insurer's loss. Victoire has cut its dividend to FFr 6.5 a share
from FFr 19.5 the year before.
The Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, specialist in trade and
investment credits, yesterday announced a rise in net profit to FFr137m for
last year, compared to FFr115m in 1991.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Premafin shares hit by warning
of losses

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Premafin, the Italian holding company controlled by property
magnate Mr Salvatore Ligresti, fell by more than 8 per cent following the
forecast of heavy 1992 losses and a big rights issue.
The group announced the promotion to executive deputy chairman of Mr Giorgio
Cefis, a former Morgan Grenfell banker, and the appointment of Mr Carlo
Ciani, managing director of the Coin department stores chain and previously
with Mediobanca, as executive deputy chairman of Mr Ligresti's
privately-owned Nuova Finanziaria Moderna holding company.
Premafin's shares plunged to L4,330 from L4,685 on Tuesday as investors
digested the group's L294bn (Dollars 185.4m) rights issue and expected 1992
loss of L50bn. In 1991, the company made net profits of L61.9bn. The group
will not pay a dividend this year and plans a three-for-one rights issue at
L1,000 a share. Mr Ligresti, who owns 70 per cent of the group, will take up
his full rights.
The fortunes of Premafin, which controls Sai (insurance) and Grassetto
(building), have suffered from debts of about L1,500bn, the downturn in
construction as a result of the political corruption scandal and weak
property markets.
Matters have been exacerbated by doubts about Mr Ligresti's future. The
Sicilian financier spent more than three months in jail last year on charges
of alleged bribery and corruption.
The Ligresti group is to re-organise other parts of its business, with the
concentration under the non-quoted Nuova Finanziaria Moderna holding company
of activities previously held under the Fin. G. It holding company and other
subsidiaries.
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-owned bank, saw a 17.1 per
cent rise in consolidated group profits to L96bn last year from L82bn in
1991. Assets rose 13.6 per cent to L163,341bn.

FT  08 APR 93 / Cuomo spurns nomination to Supreme Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Mario Cuomo of New York has taken himself out of consideration for
nomination to the US Supreme Court, according to news reports yesterday.
Mr Cuomo, who has long been an eloquent social conscience for the Democratic
party, had been viewed as the frontrunner to replace Justice Byron White,
who will retire from the court this summer.
But Newsday, a New York daily newspaper, reported yesterday the governor had
withdrawn his name, and the Associated Press said White House officials had
confirmed the report.
President Bill Clinton refused to discuss the Supreme Court appointment
yesterday, but said he thought Mr Cuomo was 'terrific'.
During last year's presidential election campaign Mr Clinton had said he
thought the New York governor would make a good Supreme Court justice, and
Mr Cuomo himself has said the position would be ideal.
However, in his usual ambivalent style, he also likened the court to a tomb.
Mr Cuomo may be unwilling to give up his high profile in the political
arena.
Membership of the Supreme Court is usually a lifetime job, and Mr Cuomo has
often been mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr Clinton will be the first Democrat to select a Supreme Court justice
since President Lyndon Johnson, and the appointment is viewed as reversing
the court's long march towards a more conservative jurisprudence under the
intellectual leadership of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Besides Mr Cuomo, most speculation on a replacement has centred on sitting
judges such as Ms Patricia Wald or Ms Stephanie Seymour, who are on federal
appeals courts.
While most recent nominees have been judges, in the past the Supreme Court
has included more politicians and legal scholars.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICA'S opposition Labour party is to boycott sittings of the island's
parliament and will not appoint any senators, in protest at the conduct of
last week's general election in which the People's National Party was
returned to office.
Mr Edward Seaga, Labour's leader, has also asked the government to dismiss
the police commissioner and to set up a public inquiry under the island's
chief justice to study the conduct of the election.
The poll was marred by clashes between party factions and the stealing of
ballot boxes and papers from polling stations, mainly in Kingston, the
capital.
Mr P J Patterson, prime minister, has rejected Mr Seaga's call for an
inquiry, saying the law allowed any citizen to take cases of electoral
malpractice to the courts.
He said also that if Mr Seaga did not appoint opposition senators he will be
failing in his duty as opposition leader, and should stand down in favour of
someone else.
The office of the director of elections reported yesterday that the official
counting of votes was continuing, and that official declarations had given
the PNP 49 and Labour six of the 60 seats contested last week.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A presentation by Reuters' chief executive prompted some analysts to take a
somewhat less enthusiastic view of shares in the electronic information
group.
Mr Peter Job, at a presentation late on Tuesday, cast doubt over the
anticipated bonus to shareholders from the company's Pounds 700m cash
mountain. He also said prices for some of the company's services would be
held down for the next year.
The media team at French-owned investment house SGST said it 'found no
reason to change our view that the stock is expensive' and reiterated its
sell stance at the morning meeting. The shares lost 15 to 1330p on turnover
of 1.3m.
British Petroleum's recent excellent run was halted in midsession when
dealers picked up hints that the latest well, on its Cusiana project in
Colombia, was dry. The oil field, discovered last year, is BP's biggest find
since Forties, in the North Sea, and Prudhoe Bay.
The Cusiana speculation pushed BP down to 302p before it closed only
fractionally off at 306p. Turnover came to 7.9m.
Lasmo came under renewed downward pressure as the series of post-results
meetings with big institutional shareholders - many disillusioned by the
results and dividend cut - continued. Lasmo eased 4 to 154p on 2.2m traded.
Sun Alliance rose strongly ahead of today's preliminary figures, closing 12
higher at 354p, mostly reflecting a stock shortage, according to dealers.
Analysts expect the group to reveal domestic mortgage indemnity losses of
around Pounds 200m, leading to pre-tax losses of between Pounds 140m to
Pounds 165m.
GEC, boosted in recent weeks by a series of bullish broker circulars,
delivered another strong performance, with SG Warburg said to have been one
of the keenest supporters of the shares yesterday. They closed 6 up at a
10-year high of 323p on good turnover of 11m.
A buy note from James Capel on Marks and Spencer was the highlight of a dull
stores sector, although the stock saw an initial gain eroded to close only a
penny firmer at 339p. Elsewhere, Kingfisher continued to respond to recent
positive broker comments and added a penny at 581p. Dixons put on 2 at 210p
after announcing the sale of its Supasnaps chain to Sketchley.
Food retailers bore the brunt of negative comment over Tuesday's results
from Tesco, with fears of a price war worrying some. Tesco shares tumbled,
but managed to rally towards the end for a net loss of 3 at 229p. J.
Sainsbury slipped 8 to 464p, Kwik Save 10 to 742p and Argyll 7 to 326p.
One reason why the sector has been under a cloud was evident in figures from
Nurdin &amp; Peacock with an upbeat view of the group's Club Warehouse concept,
the US-style discount store scheme currently worrying food specialists.
Together with good figures, this sent the shares forward 9 to 218p.
A gloomy drinks sector was further clouded by a cautious statement from
Heineken, the big Dutch brewer, which announced results yesterday. The group
said the European drinks trade was 'one of stagnation without any likelihood
of a substantial improvement in the short term'. Predictably, the worst
casualties were stocks combining international exposure and famous brand
names. Allied-Lyons fell 12 to 558p, Grand Metropolitan 8 to 418p and
Guinness 14 to 464p.
Hotel stocks stabilised, in spite of Savoy Group's report of losses for the
first time in its history. The tightly traded Savoy, in which Forte owns 42
per cent of the voting rights, slipped just 2 to 738p. Analysts said the
figures were in line with expectations. Forte shares defied continued talk
of a dividend cut next week, and rumblings of a rights issue to fund any
fire sale purchase at the suspended Queens Moat Houses, to rise 3 1/2 to
181p.
Defence group Hunting closed 8 lower at 230p, after it surprised the market
with a 2 for 9 rights issue to raise Pounds 36.8m, as it reported full year
figures ahead of market expectations.
British Steel remained under pressure and the shares eased 1 3/4 to 78p, as
several brokers continued to urge investors to sell the stock. Analysts fear
that demand for steel will continue falling. Turnover was 5.9m shares.
The reduction of profit estimates by several brokers earlier this week
continued to weaken BAA and the shares closed 9 lower at 779p. GKN gave up 7
to 449p, on worries concerning the weakness in the German economy previously
a lucrative market for the company.
A profits warning from dry cleaner Sketchley sent the shares falling sharply
to close 14 lower at 96p. Accountancy practice worries continued to dog
Morgan Crucible leaving the shares to fall 9 1/2 to 277 1/2 p.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas strengthens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best performance from the energy sector of the market came from British
Gas after the stock was given a strong boost at the annual oil seminar given
by Kleinwort Benson Securities. The broker's bullish presentation on Gas
drove the shares up to an all-time high of 313p before profit-taking left
the stock closing a net 3 ahead at 310 1/2 p.
British Gas was the Kleinwort oil team's prime buy recommendation, with the
broker highlighting Gas's growth potential over the next five years. 'Gas's
upstream arm will transform the company over the next five years,' said
Kleinwort's Mr Paul Spedding.
The broker put a valuation of Pounds 5bn on Gas's upstream division, and
forecast a startling acceleration in cash flow generated by the upstream arm
from 1994-95 onwards as many of Gas's North Sea projects are developed and
move into production. Mr Spedding estimated that cash flow would surge from
1993's Pounds 100m to above Pounds 1bn by 1997 and that the division should
provide some 30 per cent of Gas's profits by the turn of the century.
Kleinwort also focused on the increasing importance of rising unregulated
upstream earnings which should give a push to Gas's price/earnings multiple.
Regarding the MMC review, the broker 'does not expect a tightening of the
regulatory regime'.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rothmans hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over the prospects for tobacco groups in particular and the value of
branded goods in general spilled over into Rothmans International, the 'B'
shares dropping 27 to 615p.
Rothmans does not sell cigarettes in the US and would not be hit by the
recent announcement from Philip Morris of a price war. However, analysts
said Philip Morris's decision to drop the price of its Marlboro brand had
prompted the market to look at companies with any cigarette exposure and
also group's with highly valued brands. Rothmans markets luxury goods under
the Dunhill and Cartier labels. BAT Industries, whose shares were savaged by
the Philip Morris move last week, declined 6 to 874p.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome sellers return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS group Wellcome lost ground in spite of attempts by the company
yesterday to staunch the recent blood-letting.
Wellcome tried to counter doubts about the effectiveness of its AZT
anti-Aids drug with data suggesting that early use could improve the chances
of survival. However, the attempt appeared to fuel controversy as investors,
unimpressed with the company's arguments, sold shares again on fears of
another round of negative publicity for the drug.
The argument over the accuracy of the long-lasting Concorde trial was taken
a stage further as one of the trial's senior researchers hit out at the
company. Professor Ian Weller, the trial's principal UK investigator,
accused Wellcome of 'manipulating the data of the trial'. Wellcome shares
closed 23 lower at 698p. There was some switching into Glaxo, which rose 8
to 584p.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,800 tested in poor turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISAPPOINTINGLY small reduction in money market repurchase rates in
Germany deepened the gloom in the UK stock market yesterday, and the FT-SE
Index bounced uncomfortably on the 2,800 mark before rallying weakly in late
trading.
A blue chip sector already hurt by renewed selling of Wellcome and tobacco
issues took further losses after a sell-off in stock index futures.
Seaq-reported trading volume was thin, but dealers commented that the retail
business, always reported one day in arrears, has remained strong as the
market has slipped by nearly 39 points on the Footsie scale over the past
trading week.
Equities opened firmly as renewed improvement in sterling buttressed hopes
that domestic rates might be cut soon. Reports that March had brought the
largest monthly upturn in UK house prices for four years also helped
sentiment.
But the early gain of 4.8 on the Footsie scale was quickly reversed when the
June future contract on the index ran into sellers. Share prices then
drifted lower, with the setback restrained by some arbitraging against stock
index futures.
However, the very modest slackening in German repurchase rates, which are
seen in London as the most likely arena for an easing of Bundesbank policy,
sent share prices on the downward trend.
At worst the market touched 2,800.6 on the Footsie, a net 31.6 down, lending
conviction to those analysts who have predicted a Footsie in the 2,780 area
before long. In the absence of selling pressure, however, London staged a
thinly traded technical rally at the close, encouraged by an early gain of
17 Dow points as New York opened.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.1 off on the day at 2,822.1.
Trading volume barely moved in the final hour, bearing out comments from the
dealing rooms that there had been little strength behind the late recovery
in share prices.
At 508m shares, Seaq volume was down from the 538.4m recorded the previous
day; retail volume worth Pounds 1.13bn on Tuesday indicated that genuine
investment activity has remained satisfactory, from the point of view of the
London-based securities houses.
Most of the blue chip sectors continued to lack support. Among the
much-battered pharmaceuticals, Glaxo showed some recovery but Wellcome was
again sharply lower. Tobacco shares, too, remained under the pressure
imposed last week by the decision by Philip Morris, of the US, to cut
cigarette prices.
Some confidence was shown in the building materials and construction
sectors, which are likely to be the immediate beneficiaries of economic
recovery.
But doubts that the recovery will be consumer driven were reflected in
losses across the brewery and distillery stocks.
Traders comforted themselves with the belief that UK securities markets had
already slowed down ahead of the Easter weekend, which will shut the London
markets from tonight until Tuesday morning.
But anxious glances were thrown at the Footsie 2,800 mark, which many
analysts expect to face further testing today unless there are more positive
factors to encourage investors in the UK equity market.

FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG two-way business in index options boosted total turnover as London's
derivatives market announced the introduction of eight new equity options
contracts, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having been in the doldrums over the previous two sessions, business in the
traded options showed a marked improvement and turnover by the close had
reached 39,817 contracts. Some 10,762 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100
option, while the Euro FT-SE option was also heavily traded at 9,218
contracts.
In the stock options, Asda Group was the most active with a total of 5,994
contracts and was followed by Hanson at 2,507. BT and Hillsdown were also
heavily traded.
The Liffe yesterday announced the introduction of eight new equity options
contracts, taking the number traded to 70.
The new contracts are Argyll Group, National Westminster Bank, Redland,
Royal Insurance, Tarmac, Tomkins, Williams Holdings and Zeneca. All with the
exception of Zeneca will be traded from May 12. Options in Eurotunnel, GKN,
Vaal Reefs and Scottish &amp; Newcastle are being phased out.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,843 and drifted
lower for the rest of the day to end at 2,828, down 17 from its previous
close and at a 5-point premium to the underlying cash market. Volume was
9,584 lots.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program buying helps Dow
to improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended firmer yesterday after gains in certain sectors -
notably transportation and brokerage stocks - and some late program buying
helped the markets recover from losses incurred earlier in the week among
consumer issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.45 up at 3,397.02. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index gained 1.57 at 442.73 and the Nasdaq composite firmed
4.74 to 668.88. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 298m shares.
The markets still lacked an overall clear direction, a reflection of
nervousness following the recent sell-off in leading consumer stocks such as
Wal-Mart and Home Depot, and of the cautious approach investors were
adopting ahead of the all-important inflation news due out today and
tomorrow, when the March producer and consumer indices will be published.
Recent gains in commodity prices, coupled with continued strength in certain
areas of the economy, have revived fears that inflationary pressures may be
building up. Those fears have trimmed prices in bond and stock markets and,
if the March prices data comes in stronger than expected, analysts warn that
equity prices could tumble.
Some individual sectors performed strongly. Airlines were generally higher
amid hopes that the recent restructuring in the industry would eventually
lead to a return to profitability for the country's biggest carriers. Among
the leading stocks, UAL (which announced further cuts in aircraft order
costs yesterday) jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 137, Delta added Dollars 3
3/4 at Dollars 57 1/4 , USAir advanced Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 and
AMR, parent of American Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 69.
Brokerage issues were also in demand, following record quarterly results
from Bear Stearns for the January-to-March reporting period. Bear Stearns
ended Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 19, Merrill Lynch up Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 69 1/4 and PaineWebber Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 24 7/8 .
Home Depot bounced back from losses incurred earlier in the week, rallying
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 58 in volume of 3.6m shares. US Surgical fell
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 after a Dean Witter analyst changed his
recommendation on the stock to 'sell' from 'neutral' and cut his forecast
for 1993 sales and profits because he fears the company has over-estimated
future sales of its tools for laparoscopic surgeons.
Advanced Micro Devices rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 in volume of
2.3m shares after Warburg, the securities house, raised its investment
rating on the stock from 'add' to 'buy', citing the company's better than
expected first-quarter results.
Canada
AFTER trading in negative territory for most of the day, Toronto saw a
modest last-hour rally which left shares closing mixed with just a slightly
easier bias. Trading was again heavy.
The TSE 300 index was finally up 2.6 at 3,601.4 but declines led advances by
358 to 324 after volume of 59.0m shares valued at CDollars 513.8m.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan investors begin to
believe economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the exception of Milan, which took its rally to a third day, bourses
tended to ease yesterday on position-squaring ahead of the Easter holiday,
reaction to company results and a degree of disappointment with the
Bundesbank's slow approach to interest rate cuts, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN rose on a broad front as investors began to believe a number of
economists who have been suggesting in recent days that the worst of the
Italian recession was over, and that the economy was poised for an
export-led recovery.
Comments by the governor of the Bank of Italy and the president of Italy's
Banking Association about the outlook for lower interest rates also helped
the mood. The Comit index rose 13.21 or 2.7 per cent to 498.76.
Fiat and Generali were among the strongest performers, boosted by
short-covering linked to monthly options' contracts. Generali fixed L1,390
higher at L35,090 and added another L110 on the kerb.
Fiat rose L258 or 4.5 per cent to fix at L5,928 before rising to L6,030
after hours as rumours about asset sales continued. Speculation this week
about a possible disposal of its retail group took the Rinascente shares
L190 or 2.2 per cent higher to to L8,775.
FRANKFURT fell as the Bundesbank shaved just four basis points off its short
term repo rates. The automotive sector fell in unison as the DAX index
closed 15.09 lower at 1,650.31 in turnover down from DM5.9bn to DM5.6bn.
Daimler fell DM16.70 to DM563.80 on reports that a major German bank had
made the shares a trading sell, bringing its Mercedes unit down DM19 to
DM545; and VW lost DM7.90 to DM308 on profit-taking after hitting a new 1993
high on Tuesday.
Mr Patrick Bettscheider, deputy equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in
Frankfurt, said that the two carmakers apart, the market was illiquid on
both the buy and the sell side, waiting for a new direction. In his view,
that will be up, and will accelerate when other major companies are seen to
employ the same cost cutting and restructuring policies which have brought
VW back to popularity.
Meanwhile, AEG fell DM8.50 to DM160 after it predicted 1993 operating losses
at least as high as the DM200m of 1992.
PARIS seemed unimpressed by its results season as the CAC-40 index fell
11.37 to 1,983.96 in thin to moderate trade.
The tyremaker, Michelin, lost FFr1.90 to FFr165.10 after warning of a
first-half loss if business does not improve. Worries about Michelin spilled
over into Peugeot, which fell FFr6 to FFr549; and Thomson-CSF closed FFr3
lower at FFr163.50 after it reported a 35 per cent drop in profits for 1992,
and cut its dividend.
Pechiney International fell another FFr3.50 francs to FFr217 after Tuesday's
FFr10.50 decline, on further consideration of its results for 1992 and the
company's lack of optimism about the beverage can market this year.
Among the day's winners, the Ferruzzi food unit, Eridania-Beghin Say, jumped
FFr37 to FFr737 following news late on Tuesday of a 69 per cent jump in 1992
net profits.
AMSTERDAM was dominated by a fall in Heineken as the CBS Tendency index
dipped 0.5 to to 107.5 in otherwise quiet trading.
Heineken finished Fl 6.10 lower at Fl 190.90 after it said that the European
beer market was coming under increasing pressure from recession and
taxation, and warned against short-term optimism. The shares had risen by 29
per cent over the last 12 months.
Unilever ended Fl 2.70 lower at at Fl 206.40, taking a lead from the
re-rating of US consumer goods shares after Philip Morris's price cuts last
Friday.
DSM, the chemicals group, lost Fl 3.00 to Fl 84.20 as the company warned
that profits might not grow this year.
The shares of the newly-merged Bols Wessanen finished at Fl 42.60 on their
first day of trading.
ZURICH edged back after Tuesday's record close and the SMI index shed 11.1
to 2,184.9 in thin trading.
Nestle, down SFr35 or 2.9 per cent at SFr1,160, was hit by fears of
increased price competition after the Philip Morris price cuts.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Eastern promise vanishes in Austria -
The stock market darling of yesteryear, Vienna has lost its lustre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and Communism collapsed all over
eastern Europe, the Vienna stock market became the darling of the
international investment community, outperforming the world's major markets
for more than a year.
But now, as economic reform has stalled in many East European countries and
the future of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is in doubt, Austrian
stocks have lost their lustre.
The main factor holding down the Vienna market, say analysts, is not the
political turmoil in the East, but economic weakness at home. The country,
which is highly dependent on the German economy, has recently slid into
recession; company profits have tumbled and many industries have been hit by
a string of bankruptcies.
'Unless the economic data begin to show that the downward trend has ended
and that a recovery is setting in, I do not see much upward potential for
the stock market,' says Walter Schuster, first vice-president for capital
markets at Girocredit. But as long as Russia and eastern Europe are not hit
by a long period of political instability, he adds, the ups and downs in
Moscow will not have more than a fleeting impact on Vienna shares.
Traders expect some jitters ahead of the April 25 referendum, which could
keep prices down. When Mr Yeltzin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, his main rival,
clashed in a dramatic power struggle last month, Vienna stocks went into a
slide which erased most of the gains made since the year began.
But politics has only reinforced an economic trend which was already
pointing downward, says Mr Franz Amstler, a securities expert at Bank
Austria. 'Yeltsin and Khasbulatov were the trigger, not the cause,' he adds.
Most of the blue chip shares traded on the stock exchange are highly
cyclical, and even the banks, which should benefit from lower interest
rates, have suffered from the crisis in industry, because of their loan
exposure and their huge equity portfolios. Bank Austria and Creditanstalt,
the two largest banks, also own two of the largest industrial groups.
Construction materials, paper and machinery stocks, some of the largest
sectors on the stock exchange, have been hurt by the rise of the Austrian
schilling, which is pegged to the German D-Mark, against many European
currencies since last autumn, and a surge of cheap imports from eastern
Europe. 'Industry is caught in a double whammy,' says Mr Schuster of
Girocredit. 'It is losing market share abroad because of the exchange rate,
and under pressure at home from imports.'
Things looked much better just over a month ago. High interest rates, forced
upon Austria and the rest of Europe by the German Bundesbank, were beginning
to come down, which had helped the ATX index to climb about 20 per cent from
712.06 to a March 3 peak of 860.17. But a combination of a technical
correction, negative economic and corporate news and political uncertainty
cut the rally short. Yesterday the ATX closed at 779.25, down more than 50
per cent from its 1990 high.
Some analysts say that prices might go through another upturn of 10 to 15
per cent in the summer, if short-term interest rates continue to fall.
Long-term rates are already close to their historical lows, however, and are
unlikely, say experts, to give the market any further support. As Vienna's
average price-earnings ratio of 28 is quite high compared with other
markets, further equity advances will depend on a recovery in the corporate
sector, they add.
A sustained recovery in neighbouring Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland
would also help. A key weakness of the market remains its high volatility,
which is exacerbated by its small size, low turnover and low liquidity.
Daily turnover often surpassed ASch1bn in 1990, when Austria was hot among
international investors, but it has fallen as low as Sch300m this year.
'Very few Austrians hold stocks, and foreign investors are deterred by the
low trading volume,' says Mr Christoph Rohrmoser, an analyst for Erste
Invest-Consult, the capital markets arm of the Erste bank. Weak
insider-trading laws and a string of insider-trading scandals last year has
also damaged the reputation of the Vienna market, but their effect might
have been exaggerated. 'The foreigners investing in Austria are used to
worse conditions than they find here,' Mr Rohrmoser concludes.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand pushes
Nikkei to high for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices surged on active buying by investors eager to increase exposure
to Japanese stocks, and the Nikkei average briefly rose above the 20,000
level before losing some of the gain on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 342.43 ahead at a peak for the year of 19,829.23. It
opened at the day's low of 19,506.58 and surged as high as 20,054.51 in the
morning session. Profit-taking by institutional investors later eroded part
of the rise.
Volume increased from 734m shares to 850m. Rises led falls by 809 to 271,
with 112 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
appreciated 29.75 to 1,559.22, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
4.10 at 1,234.95.
Traders said investors, especially UK and US pension funds, were eager to
buy stocks on a dip. Japanese brokers pointed out that the rise was
liquidity driven rather than a rally supported by economic fundamentals such
as corporate earnings. 'We are telling clients to ignore fundamentals for
the moment,' said one broker.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone led the rise, advancing Y20,000 to Y1.06m in
active volume. Traders said investors remained bullish about NTT.
Companies with close links to NTT gained ground, with Iwasaki Electric
rising Y16 to Y586 and Nitsuko Y8 to Y758. Fujikura, the telecom company,
however, receded Y20 to Y1,010 on profit-taking.
Exporters, which have been slow to respond to the recent rally due to the
higher yen, surged on bargain hunting. Fujitsu moved ahead Y12 to Y662 and
Sony Y420 to Y4,950. Car manufacturers were also firm, with Toyota Motor
adding Y110 at Y1,680.
Drug issues were also picked up as laggards, relative to the Nikkei index.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical improved Y130 to Y2,480 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical
Y50 to Y1,670.
Dowa Mining retreated Y22 to Y645. The issue had gained on reports that the
company had discovered a gold vein in northern Japan.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 389.97 to 21,547.41 in volume of 39.2m
shares.
Roundup
A FIRM trend was evident in a number of the Pacific Basin markets.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index finished at a fourth consecutive
all-time high, up 10.42 at 1,721.20. Solid institutional and retail buying
activity took volume up to a hefty 361m shares from Tuesday's 255m.
Singapore property stocks were in demand on local media reports that
mortgage rates would remain soft.
TAIWAN finished at a 12-month peak in heavy trade. The weighted index, up
more than 100 points before profit-taking set in, ended 30.67 ahead at
5,013.28, its highest close since 5,029.61 on March 14, 1992. Turnover
amounted to TDollars 81.24bn.
Profit-taking in banking issues, which have led recent gains, deterred
investors from pushing the market up more sharply. But most industrial
shares gained, with textiles and electronics particularly strong. China
Steel appreciated 80 cents to TDollars 20.10 in very heavy business.
SEOUL saw active trade which took the composite index above the 700 level
shortly after the opening. But profit-taking on large-capitalisation shares
dragged the index back to close a net 2.38 higher at 699.49.
KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed, although Idris Hydraulic resumed its surge on
speculative buying. The composite index breached the 660 resistance level to
end 5.46 firmer at a year's high of 661.35.
Idris, in spite of saying that it had no material announcement to make,
surged 70 cents to MDollars 2.71 in volume of a record 214.1m shares.
MANILA continued to rise for a third day on bargain hunting in anticipation
of a rally. The composite index closed 26.75 higher at 1,556.13, for a
cumulative 4.87 per cent advance since last Friday.
AUSTRALIA declined in dull pre-holiday trade, brightened only by Mr Kerry
Packer's reported raid on John Fairfax. The All Ordinaries index lost 3.4 to
1,654.9 in turnover of ADollars 283.4m. Some 36m Fairfax shares were traded
at USDollars 2.10 each after the market closed on Tuesday. Reports that Mr
Packer was the buyer sent Fairfax up 6 cents to ADollars 1.98.
HONG KONG closed almost 1 per cent down, although there were signs of
support at lower levels. The Hang Seng index slid 59.13 to 6,281.70 in
turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn.
BOMBAY ended with the BSE index 97.24, or 4.2 per cent, higher at 2,408.68.
Unfortunately, the interest rate cuts expected from the Reserve Bank of
India after the close were not forthcoming; and although the RBI changed its
credit policy, allowing borrowing against shareholdings of up to 50 per cent
of their value, against 25 per cent previously, brokers were divided on
which way the market would move today.

FT  08 APR 93 / Money Markets: Small cut in DM repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a constantly shifting mood in European cash and futures markets
yesterday, with various indications about when rates might be cut in
Germany, writes James Blitz.
German markets had been very optimistic first thing in the morning that the
Bundesbank would significantly ease the rate at which it offers wholesale
funds to commercial banks. However, after announcing a variable rate tender
for money market funds on Tuesday, the Bundesbank said yesterday that the
lowest accepted repo rate for short-dated liquidity was 8.13 per cent, and
that it was 8.15 per cent for 35-day funds.
This was a rather smaller cut than the market had expected. Speculation had
been that the repo rate would come down from 8.17 per cent to 8.10 per cent
or even lower.
The repo announcement firmed German call money. The overnight cost of
lending D-Marks had fallen to 8.00 per cent at the start of the day, and was
back up at 8.14 per cent by the close.
The duller mood was also the result of a net drain of DM8.1bn from the money
market in the two-tranche deal. However, dealers said the market was still
adequately provided with liquidity.
Euromark contracts fell back from their opening levels, with the June
contract showing a drop of 10 basis points at one stage to a day's low of
92.78.
However, the contract subsequently rallied to finish at 92.86, partly helped
by a slight downward revision in the German consumer prices figure for
March, from a month-on-month rise of 0.4 per cent to one of 0.3 per cent.
This offset fears that German rates would only fall slowly because of
inflationary pressures.
Sterling markets were quiet. There had been rumours of an imminent cut in
base rates at the start of the day, partly because the sterling exchange
rate index touched the 80.00 per cent level for only the second time since
January 25, the day before the previous easing in UK rates.
However, the UK authorities have made clear their reluctance to ease policy
for now. Three-month money finished unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent and the
one-month rate closed at 5 3/4 per cent. There was little difficulty
removing a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn forecast by the Bank of England at the
start of the day.

FT  08 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong performance by franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc continued to perform strongly against the D-Mark yesterday
as dealers speculated that the Bank of France might cut its official
interest rates today in a move to stimulate the French economy, writes James
Blitz.
There was disappointment at the start of European trading that the
Bundesbank had reduced the cost of borrowing wholesale funds in the German
money market by a smaller amount than anticipated, making it more difficult
for France to ease policy.
But the franc's strong performance in the first week-and-a- half of the life
of the new French government raised hopes that the authorities in Paris
might be confident enough to reduce their official 5 to 10-day lending rate,
currently at 12 per cent.
The franc closed a touch stronger against the D-Mark in London at FFr3.3834
from a previous FFr3.3840. Three-month French franc interest rates fell to
about 9.0 per cent from 9.50 per cent, the lowest they have been since
November 12 last year.
The recent narrowing of the spread between three-month French francs and
three-month D-Marks shows the franc is shaking off the need to have a
premium against devaluation. The spread was down to around 120 basis points
yesterday, having been at 400 basis points in January.
However, Mr Jonathan Hoffman, economics director at Credit Suisse First
Boston, believes the Bank of France may leave policy unchanged today. He
thinks that French industrial companies, which tend to borrow at the long
end of the market, are satisfied with the recent reductions in the spread
between German bunds and French government bonds - and that this should take
pressure off the Bank of France to ease policy.
Yesterday's cut in the repo rate took only 4 basis points off the cost of
borrowing 14-day funds, when the market had been expecting a reduction of at
least 7 basis points to around 8.10 per cent.
Both the dollar and sterling performed quite firmly against the D-Mark
yesterday, in spite of the modest size of the repo cut. The US unit ended
some  1/4 pfennig higher at DM1.6155, while sterling finished 1/2 pfennig
stronger at DM2.4475. In New York the dollar further improved to close at
DM1.6188.
The two currencies were boosted by a revised figure for March consumer price
inflation in Germany, putting the year-on-year rise at 4.2 per cent instead
of 4.3 per cent. This raised speculation that high inflation might not be
such a strong excuse in Frankfurt for tight monetary policy.
The dollar was also underpinned by expectations that Friday's CPI figure for
March might show an increase in inflation and a need for US interest rates
to rise. Sterling's stronger performance was due to a report from the
Halifax building society showing that house prices had seen their largest
rise for four years in March.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME acts to contain VAT row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FESTERING problem for London Metal Exchange traders and their clients over
changes to the European Community's value added tax regulations erupted
yesterday when the exchange temporarily disenfranchised its warehouses in
France.
A decision to change the Community rules was taken late in December and this
took effect in January. The new regulations implied that VAT would have to
be paid any time metal of European origin changed hands in the EC, even if
it was not removed from warehouse.
Although the VAT could be reclaimed, the implications for traders' cash
flows were vast. One trader estimated his organisation would have to find an
extra Dollars 100m for VAT if the rules were not changed.
Traders reacted by diverting thousands of tonnes of metal from Europe to LME
warehouses in other parts of the world.
The LME executive consulted the European Commission, identified a solution
to the problem and has been putting this to the authorities in those EC
countries where the exchange has warehouses.
Agreement has already been reached in the Netherlands and Belgium, where the
biggest tonnage of LME metal is stored. Mr David King, the exchange's chief
executive, said yesterday: 'We have already made substantial progress, given
the magnitude of this problem.'
However, he suggested the French 'are being less pragmatic than the Dutch
and Belgians and so far have not been inclined to change their rules.'
As it was the LME's policy to have its approved warehouses open to all its
listed brands of metal without restriction of taxes and duties, it would no
longer permit delivery of any metal - whether from the EC or elsewhere -
into the French warehouses in Dunkirk.
Dunkirk is not one of the LME's important locations. About 5,160 tonnes of
metal is on warrant there compared with 1.75m tonnes in Rotterdam and
450,000 tonnes in Antwerp.
Mr King said contacts had been made with the authorities in Italy, Germany
and Spain but so far there had not been enough time for the problem to be
fully discussed there.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia rejects wool price
plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday rejected calls for the reimposition of
price fixing to increase returns to wool producers hit by record low prices.
Mr Simon Crean, the federal primary industries minister, said calls for a
return to the floor price system abolished in 1991 were 'nonsense - the
government cannot solve the problem by artificially fixing the price. That
is not the solution to the problem - it caused the problem'.
Mr Crean was responding to calls by growers for urgent action to reduce the
impact of a collapse in the national market indicator to 412 cents a
kilogramme from nearly 550 cents in November.
The market indicator, a weighted average of auction prices for 15 grades of
wool, stood at 729 cents before the abolition of the 700 cents floor price
two years ago.
Many growers blame the slide in prices on a 3.9m bale stockpile of unsold
wool held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC), a
government-appointed body set up after the abolition of price fixing. The
AWRC has resisted growers' calls for the stockpile to be destroyed or sold
to the former Soviet Union, once a major buyer of Australian wool, on
generous credit terms.
However, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), the industry's marketing
organisation, left the option of barter or credit sales open at its annual
meeting yesterday in the wool growing town of Tamworth.
Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman, said that a 'crippling imbalance' between supply
and demand was the main reason why the industry was facing 'the worst
downturn of its long, proud and tumultuous history'.
Production was expected to total 794m kilogrammes in the year to the end of
June, compared with average production of 675m kg in the five years to 1985,
when the industry was consistently profitable, he said.
Mr Drysdale was careful not to question the commission's legal
responsibility to manage the stockpile. However, he said the commission
'could look at' several non-commercial ways of disposing of it. These
included barter trading with countries where hard currency is in short
supply; establishing joint venture processing facilities with such
countries; and using stockpile wool to fulfil foreign aid commitments.
The wool industry's problems stem from over-production following a boom in
prices in 1987-88, when the market indicator (then calculated on a slightly
different basis) rose from 781 cents to 1,269 cents.
Production rose steadily in response to high prices, but the market
indicator collapsed to just over 700 cents following the partial withdrawal
from the market of the Soviet Union, China and Japan.
At its peak, the stockpile of unsold wool purchased by the corporation under
the floor price system stood at 4.8m bales, financed by government
guaranteed debt of ADollars 2.8bn and a 25 per cent levy on growers'
incomes.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox set to reform raw sugar
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) is expected to announce on
Tuesday major changes to its raw sugar market.
The present raw sugar contract might even be closed, to be replaced by one
designed to prove more attractive to the London sugar trade.
The Fox raw sugar market has suffered a dramatic slide in volumes over the
past couple of years. Fox has tackled the problem, including experimenting
with screen trading, but to no avail. Last month volume fell to just 1,399
lots compared with 4,384 lots in March last year.
In January 1991, when raw sugar was switched to screen trading in a bid to
boost volumes, the contract traded 120,176 lots. By December of that year
volume had dwindled to 24,157 lots and in January 1992 the contract was
taken off the screen and put back on the floor.
By then, however, London traders were losing interest. The relatively young
New York market, which attracts a lot of speculative money, has usurped
London's role as sugar's international price setter.
Some critics have blamed London's decline on the failed experiment in screen
trading. Others point to a decision to make Cuban sugar deliverable in
London, which ruled out US market players. Yesterday Fox said that Cuban
sugar would no longer be deliverable.
However, the fall in volumes has taken place against a background of changes
in the underlying physical market over the past decade. The London raw
contract was designed with British Commonwealth producers in mind. But now
much more sugar comes out of the Far East and Latin America. At the same
time the number of big traders in London has declined.
Fox will keep its screen-traded white sugar contract, which is in
competition with a similar contract on France's Matif. Last month Fox white
sugar turnover totalled 38,395 lots, compared with 23,633 lots in March
1992.
London's International Petroleum Exchange has reported a 37 per cent
increase in volumes for the 1992-93 financial year to 11.9m contracts. Mr
Peter Wildblood, chief executive, said yesterday that monthly volumes had
exceeded 1m lots for the past six months and 'conservative commentators are
confident that this trend will continue.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US pork farmers await ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US PORK producers are waiting with some anxiety for the outcome of their
'extraordinary challenge' to a US-Canadian panel whose ruling on an American
anti-subsidy complaint, expected today, could remove the approximately
Dollars 18 a head countervailing duty imposed on Canadian swine imports.
The Americans have three times gone before such 'bi-national' panels,
established under the US-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and each time they
have lost. This time, said Mr Russ Sanders, executive vice president of the
National Pork Producers Council, a loss could set a precedent allowing
bi-national panels to 'rewrite US trade law'.
Even so, a defeat would mean only a stumble in the otherwise forward
movement of US producers into a future which once seemed clouded by the
fitness and nutrition crazes of the last 20 years. Clever marketing and
judicious use of US trade policy are paying off, and the industry is surging
ahead of its competition and past expectations.
This year production could exceed last year's record-breaking 17.2bn lbs.
Despite its worries about the Canadian competition and the EC Third Country
Meat Directive (which has slashed exports to Europe), the industry is
confident and promising to export more aggressively than ever.
The Pork Producers Council attributes its turn-around to a little noticed
1985 'legislative checkoff,' which let farmers vote to contribute
automatically from each sale to a Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m marketing fund.
The Council's 'Pork - The Other White Meat' campaign has dramatically
reshaped the product's image and boosted US consumer demand.
Exports overall were up about 56 per cent in volume terms, while imports
were down 17.5 per cent.
In addition, the North American Free Trade Agreement promises the
possibility of a young, more prosperous market, 100m consumers strong.

overcome shortfalls

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO is modifying the mill at its Red Dog zinc and lead mine in Alaska in
a further bid to overcome persistent shortfalls in production.
The Vancouver-based company said that changes to the grinding circuit should
bring performance 'close to' the design capacity of 42,000 tonnes per month
of zinc concentrates. Zinc recoveries improved to 81 per cent of concentrate
content in the first quarter, from 73 per cent last year and 65 per cent in
1991.
But a spokesman acknowledged that further adjustments, mainly to pumps and
pipelines, will be required to bring lead recoveries to an acceptable level.
Lead accounts for about one-fifth of Red Dog's output.
Despite containing the world's richest zinc deposit, Red Dog's operations
have been hampered since it was commissioned in 1989 by an unexpectedly
complex ore body.
A Toronto analyst said yesterday that Cominco 'turned the deposit over from
the geologists to the mine planners too quickly.' Among the unforeseen
problems has been the discovery of oxides, which do not float and have
complicated the recovery of metal.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise of UK tractor sales cheers
equipment industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRACTOR sales in the UK rose by 13 per cent in the first quarter of 1993,
raising hopes that the equipment industry might enjoy a better year after
sales reached a record low in 1992.
According to the Agricultural Equipment Association, tractor registrations
reached 3,910 units in the first three months of this year, up 13 per cent
on a year earlier. Registrations for 1992 were 14,296.
Investment in machinery had been running at very low levels in recent years,
leading to a real need to re-equip, but uncertainty over reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy and the Gatt negotiations had held the market
back.
Improved farm incomes last year plus lower interest charges on farm
borrowing have brightened prospects but the real stimulus has been the
higher agricultural support prices resulting from devaluation of the Green
Pound, says the association.
Mr Chris Evans, its economist, said there had been a change of mood over the
past two months. Earlier, uncertainty about the future seemed to be the main
concern for farmers. In March, however, there was a surge of orders.
The association remains cautious on equipment prospects.

<TEXT>
New York raw SUGAR prices were at fresh session lows in heavy late trading.
The market was under pressure from the opening bell on technical liquidation
following Tuesday's steep decline. The nearby May contract fell more than
0.5 cents a lb, touching a low of 10.81 cents a lb. London COCOA and COFFEE
prices looked set to be winding down ahead of the Easter holidays.
Uncertainty over whether the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer,
would keep its threat not to market its mid-crop, especially given
speculation over its size, was keeping prices under wraps, dealers said. The
weakness in copper failed to unsettle the LME's other base metal contracts.
Three-month ALUMINIUM touched a fresh 16-month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne
before edging back up to finish unchanged. LEAD and ZINC continued to draw
support from recent mine cutbacks, and closed steadier. GOLD spent most of
the day testing support on the London bullion market, but SILVER showed the
most volatility of the precious metals - fund buying was prominent on dips
but profit-taking prevented any gain from being sustained.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timber accord faces green
pressures
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS ON a new tropical timber accord to replace the 1983 United
Nations agreement begin next week in Geneva amid strong pressure from
environmental groups for tougher rules on forest conservation.
The 51 members of the International Tropical Timber Agreement - who account
for virtually all the Dollars 7.5bn world tropical timber trade  - will also
discuss a controversial demand from producing countries that non-tropical
timber be included in the successor accord. This idea has already been
rejected by consumer nations.
Producers will in addition be pressing rich nations to share the burden of
tropical forest conservation by increasing financial assistance and
facilitating technology transfer.
The four-day meeting, which ends on April 16, is not expected to resolve the
main differences between the two sides. The UN Conference on Trade and
Development has already scheduled a further negotiating session in Geneva
for June 21-25.
The 1983 tropical timber accord, which came into force in 1985, is due to
expire at the end of March 1994. Its 23 producing members, the biggest being
Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, represent about 89 per cent of the world's
tropical forests and about the same proportion of world exports of tropical
timber by volume.
Japan and the European Community are by far the biggest importers among the
28 consumer members, which account for about 80 per cent of tropical timber
imports.
The 1983 agreement aims to ensure that the economic use of tropical timber
is balanced with conservation efforts and environmental needs. But
environmentalists complain that the International Tropical Timber
Organisation, which administers the pact, has failed to stop large-scale
forest destruction and degradation. For their part, producers say the ITTO
has been of little help in promoting sustainable forest development.
Initially, the main function of the Yokohama-based organisation was seen as
promoting research and development projects related to forest management,
exploitation and economic and market information. By the end of last year,
the ITTO's council had approved 179 projects worth Dollars 150m.
But in the past two to three years, the ITTO has paid more attention to
environmental issues. Its 1990 action plan includes giving priority to
arresting the decline and degradation of tropical forests, and in 1991
members committed themselves to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical
timber exports will come from sustainably managed forests. The ITTO has also
issued guidelines on sustainable forest management and the conservation of
biological diversity in tropical forests.

The only auction test of wool values this week was in New Zealand and most
of the wool sold there went at prices up to 2.5% lower than at the previous
sale. Only two-thirds of the offering was sold, the rest being held back by
growers at reserves of their own. The Easter recess in the selling season
started wilth international wool markets generally easier and with little to
indicate that demand would be sufficient to absorb auction offerings. This
has a depressing effect on trade and prices throughout the industry.

FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper savaged by new bout of
heavy selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVAGING OF the copper price continued yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange as it crashed through the psychologically-important Dollars 2,000 a
tonne level and slumped to its lowest level for five years.
Heavy selling, some of it by the Chinese who were previously substantial
buyers of copper, caused the rout.
Copper for delivery in three months was Dollars 2,026.50 a tonne at the
market's official close last night but dealers said the price continued to
fall and was trading at Dollars 1,965 a tonne - a drop of Dollars 185 or
more than 8.5 per cent since Monday.
On the New York Commodity Exchange by mid-afternoon the most-active May
copper contract was at 88.10 cents a lb (Dollars 1,942 a tonne), the lowest
since high-grade copper futures were first traded in 1988.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural
resources group, said copper might now breach the Dollars 1,940 reached on
the LME in February, 1988. 'But without question it is over-sold and we must
expect the price to bounce back.'
Traders had expected the copper price to be volatile this week as LME
options were to be declared yesterday. In the event, about 5,700 lots of
copper 'put' options, equivalent to more than 143,000 tonnes, were
exercised, traders said, an unusually large number.
Mr Adams suggested, however, this was widely expected and 'was in the
price.' Brokers had seen copper's price falling from Dollars 2,400 since the
begining of 1993 and taken action to manage the risk.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at the S G Warburg financial
services group, said that most copper producers would still be profitable at
present price levels. New technology used to produce an increasing tonnage
of copper was driving down the industry's average cost of production. 'The
price would have to drop a long way, perhaps to 60 cents a lb (Dollars 1,322
a tonne), before there would be any serious copper mine closures.'

FT  08 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Advance at Bear Stearns shows
Wall Street bullish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAR Stearns yesterday provided the first evidence that Wall Street's
earnings spree continues unabated when the publicly-owned securities house
reported record third-quarter profits of Dollars 110.42m.
The firm's profits, which cover the three months to the end of March, were
21 per cent higher than the Dollars 91.34m in the same quarter of 1992, and
were made on revenues of Dollars 570.64m, up from Dollars 532.32m a year
earlier.
Bear Stearns said its strong earnings reflected sig-nificant increases in
revenues across most main lines of business.
The investment banking unit put in the best performance, with revenues
jumping 32 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 87.9m, as the firm rode the
boom in demand from US and foreign corporations for stock and bond
underwriting services. In the first three months of the year, Bear Stearns
was the eighth biggest underwriter of debt and equity on Wall Street,
handling 55 issues worth a total of Dollars 11.7bn.
Revenues from principal transactions were also up in the third quarter, to a
record Dollars 320.3m, 3.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. The firm
said its trading of fixed-income and over-the-counter securities was
especially busy in the first three months of the year.
Commission revenues came in at Dollars 112.7m, up almost 8 per cent on 1992,
due to increased demand for the firm's correspondent clearing operations.
Bear Stearns' bottom line was helped by a modest 3.7 per cent increase in
non-interest expenses to Dollars 387.2m. In comparison, the firm's revenues
rose 7.2 per cent in the quarter. The largest component of costs, employee
compensation and benefits, rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars 276m.
The figures were well received on Wall Street. Buyers bid Bear Stearns'
shares up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 19 at the close on the New York Stock
Exchange.

FT  08 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut expectations provide the spur for
European rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets rallied on rumours that several European
central banks may announce a co-ordinated round of interest rate cuts
shortly.
German government bonds gained a quarter point on the day, despite initial
disappointment over the Bundesbank's repo result.
The Bundesbank cut the minimum interest rate on two-week securities
repurchase funds from 8.17 per cent to 8.13 per cent, with a net drain of
funds from the system. Dealers said bunds fell back on the news as the
market was disappointed by the small size of the Bundesbank's cut.
The Liffe bund future contract, which opened at 95.90, fell back to 95.71
but then rallied to reach a high of 96.15 as investors bought across the
range of maturities.
Dealers said buying was sparked mainly by rumours that there may be a
concerted round of interest rates cuts at the weekend in Europe.
The futures contract ended at around 96.10.
FRENCH government bonds staged a strong rally on expectations of a cut of at
least 100 basis points in the repo rate today.
The Matif futures contract jumped from a low of 117.60 to reach a high of
118.00, before ending at around 117.98. The yield on the 10-year bond ended
at 7.16 per cent, against its previous close of 7.21 per cent.
Dealers said there were also rumours of switching out of French equities
into bonds. They noted particularly strong buying of French bonds by US
investors.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds took their cue from the other European bond markets
yesterday, gaining up to  1/4 point at the long end.
Dealers noted strong demand for longer-dated issues, particularly in the
20-year area.
The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell two of the four tap stocks
which were announced on Friday.
The Pounds 250m tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 and the Pounds 200m
tranche of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002 were exhausted yesterday.
Short-dated gilts gained about  1/8 point, with the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due
1998 rising  3/32 to 102 1/4 .
FIRMNESS in the German government bond market and hopes of lower European
interest rates helped to lift Italian government bonds yesterday. The market
has been rocked in recent days by political scandals and traders pointed out
that Italian bonds had been 'oversold' as a result.
The Liffe BTP future broke through the 94.00 level, to end at 94.32. In the
cash market, the March 2003 BTP ended at 92.13, up from Tuesday's close of
91.85.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, the Spanish government bond market continued to fall on
political worries and lost about  3/4 point initially. However, bond prices
were pulled up later by the rally in German bonds to end unchanged on the
day.
AFTER early gains, US Treasury prices were flat-to-firmer yesterday as
investors and dealers traded cautiously ahead of today and tomorrow's
all-important inflation data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 102
1/8 , yielding 6.952 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 99 29/32 , to yield 3.908 per cent.
The main feature of the morning was a report published by economists at
Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street securities house, which predicted that the
Treasury department would cut the 30-year bond from its May refunding
altogether, and from then on switch to twice-yearly bond sales. The cut in
bond sales would be made up by an increase in bill issuance. The changes in
the borrowing schedule would be implemented as an attempt to cut the cost of
financing the huge federal budget deficit.
Goldman's report gave a lift to bond prices. But because it was not based on
contacts with Treasury officials, the market quickly gave up most gains -
prompted partly by reports of a big hedge fund sale.
It was not long before attention returned to the upcoming inflation numbers.
Recently, fears that inflationary pressures are building up in the economy
have taken the wind out of the bond market's sales, so dealers and investors
will be closely watching today's producer prices index and tomorrow's
consumer price index (both for March) for any evidence of creeping
inflation.
THE No 145 Japanese government bond fell back sharply yesterday on
speculation that it may soon lose its benchmark status.
Dealers said there were rumours that the ministry of finance had suggested
changing the benchmark bond more frequently. There was speculation in the
market that the No 153 could take over as the benchmark issue.
The No 145,which matures in March 2002, underperformed the market as the
yield moved from 4.325 per cent at the opening and traded in a range of 4.32
to 4.445 per cent, before closing in Tokyo at 4.42 per cent.
The bond recovered some of its losses in London trading, reaching a yield of
4.375 per cent.
One trader said the rumours were unlikely to be true as the No 153, which
matures in December 2002, is less liquid than the current benchmark and
consists of two separate tranches.
The sharp fall in the No 145 JGB added to the weak sentiment in the market,
traders said.
The futures contract opened at 107.76 and moved in a range of 107.60-107.91
before ending at 107.80.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Bonds: Innovative Pounds 200m Barclays Bank
issue attracts investor interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank's Pounds 200m issue of 9 7/8 per cent subordinated undated
bonds provided a focus of attention yesterday, as dealers and investors
examined the latest innovative capital structure created by a UK financial
institution.
The deal, priced to yield 140 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due
2006, is callable after 15 years; if the call option is not exercised,
interest is reset at the higher of either the current coupon or a margin of
240 basis points above the five-year gilt yield. The issue, arranged by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, was mainly placed with UK institutions.
In effect, the structure means that the investor is selling the issuer an
option to extend the debt, but many investors may view the deal as 15-year
paper, on the assumption that Barclays will exercise the call option. But it
is hard to predict the shape of the undated debt market, or even Barclays
credit, in 15 years.
Meanwhile, for the first 15 years, Barclays is paying substantially less
than it would have to pay for undated debt. For example, permanent interest
bearing shares (Pibs) issued by many building societies mostly yield about
250 basis points over the long gilt.
According to investment bankers' estimates, Barclays would probably have to
pay about 95 basis points over 15-year gilts for 15-year subordinated debt.
This means investors are effectively valuing the call option they have sold
to the issuer at 45 basis points.
For this, Barclays is gaining upper tier 2, rather than lower tier 2
capital, which suits its balance sheet needs. At the same time, the bank
does not have to lock into an interest rate forever, as in preference share
or Pibs issues, which count as tier 1 capital under international
guidelines.
Despite the attractions of the structure, UK banks have recently been active
issuers of subordinated debt, and may not need to raise further capital in
the immediate future.
The deal met firm demand from UK institutions and could well flow through to
retail accounts. The coupon of 9 7/8 per cent for a familiar name appeared
attractive in the current low interest rate environment and UK institutions,
such as insurance companies, lack higher-yielding longer-dated paper.
Pibs have proved a surprising hit with UK retail investors keen to improve
their returns now that deposit rates have fallen, and the Barclays deal
could also catch on, with a minimum denomination of Pounds 1,000 designed to
allow retail investors to participate.
Also in the sterling sector, Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a
Pounds 100m five-year deal, priced to yield 75 basis points over the 7 1/4
per cent gilt due 1998.
Unlike many recent five-year deals, the maturity date of the bond issue and
the gilt over which it is priced falls in the first half of 1998. Many
recent five-year issues were structured with maturity dates at the end of
1998, taking advantage of the shape of the yield curve to make yield spreads
appear more generous.
Elsewhere, Citibank launched an unusual issue of collared floating rate
notes, through a special purpose vehicle, backed by Federal National
Mortgage Association debentures. Bayerische Landesbank added Dollars 50m to
its collared FRN launched earlier this week. Collared floating-rate notes
incorporate minimum and maximum coupon levels, known as floors and caps, and
provide investors with an up-front premium to current short-term interest
rates.
In the Samurai bond market, the Republic of Finland launched a Y150bn issue
of 10-year bonds via Nomura Securities. Finland has now completed about
two-thirds of its FM80bn funding programme for 1993, which is to be split
between the domestic and international bond market.
The Samurai market - the Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers -
offered cheaper funding than the Euroyen market, particularly for an issue
of this size, even though fees are higher than in the Eurobond market.
The deal was the second largest launched in the Samurai bond market,
following a Y200bn issue by Sweden last year.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: CRA bid for Cail given boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADollars 716m (USDollars 487m) bid for Coal and Allied Industries (Cail)
by CRA, the Australian resources group, appeared certain to succeed
yesterday after Cail's independent directors said some shareholders should
accept the offer.
CRA was given a further lift when Mr Tony Haraldson, Cail chief executive,
and Mr Michael Blackham, deputy chief executive, said they would sell part
of their personal shareholdings.
'If I thought there was a chance that CRA would not get control, I would not
be accepting for my shares,' Mr Haraldson said. 'I have a significant
financial exposure that I would like to reduce somewhat.'
Cail's independent directors said medium to long-term investors should
reject the ADollars 11.50 a share offer because it was not high enough.
However, they advised shareholders with 'short-term liquidity requirements'
to accept.
Grant Samuel and Associates, Australia's premier valuation company, valued
Cail shares at between ADollars 12.49 and ADollars 14.61 a share and
described the bid as reasonable in a report included with the Cail
directors' statement.
Cail issued revised profit forecasts for the next three years, which it
hoped would persuade institutional shareholders to keep all or part of their
holdings. The company forecast net profit of ADollars 55.45m in 1992-93,
well above market forecasts of ADollars 45m to ADollars 50m. It said net
profit would rise to ADollars 75.15m in 1993-94 and ADollars 83.95m in the
following year.
He said the company had completed a capital expenditure programme, and
forecast that improved productivity would help it benefit from any increase
in coal prices.
The offer is CRA's second attempt to gain control of Cail, which is the
biggest coal mining group in New South Wales. CRA owns 40 per cent of Cail
following a ADollars 8.50 a share offer in 1991.
Directors of McIlwraith McEacharn, the Australian coal and transport group,
yesterday gave unanimous support to a ADollars 1.95-a-share takeover offer
from Cyprus Minerals of the US, which values the group at ADollars 82.3m.
The directors said they had asked the Australian Securities Commission to
allow shareholders who accept the offer to retain the interim dividend of
1.25 cents a share.
McIlwraith said it required 'significant financial support' to develop its
main asset, a 40 per cent holding in Oakbridge, a NSW coal producer.

THE New South Wales Supreme Court yesterday ordered Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, the international accounting and auditing firm, to pay AWA, the
Australian defence and telecommunications group, nearly ADollars 24m
(USDollars 16.9m) in damages and interest, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
The court previously ruled that Deloitte, formerly AWA's auditor, was liable
for 72 per cent of foreign-exchange trading losses by the electronics
company in 1986 and 1987. The court decided yesterday on the amount owed.
AWA may also be due costs.
Deloitte did not accept there was evidence for AWA's assertion that
directors would have changed their policy in relation to hedging against
foreign-exchange exposures.

CREDIT Bank, Greece's largest private bank, is setting up a bank in Romania
in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will
take an equity stake.
The new bank, to be called Bank of Bucharest, will have start-up capital of
Dollars 10m. It will be the first foreign-owned bank to open in the country
since the overthrow of the Communist government in 1989.
The EBRD is to contribute Dollars 2.5m in equity, with the remainder being
covered by a holding company controlled by Credit Bank, in which several
Greek businessmen will have minority holdings. The new bank will be managed
by Alpha Finance, the merchant banking arm of Credit Bank. It is expected to
start operating by the end of 1993.
Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha Finance, said the bank
would look for opportunities offered by Romania's privatisation programme as
well as financing trade carried out by a growing number of Greek-Romanian
joint ventures.

bid speculation

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr
Conrad Black, rose 5 cents to ADollars 1.97 yesterday as speculation mounted
that Mr Kerry Packer is preparing a takeover offer.
The speculation followed the purchase of a 5 per cent stake in Fairfax by
Ord Minnett, a Sydney stockbroker, for ADollars 75.6m (USDollars 54m). The
buyer was not identified, but Ord Minnett has acted for Mr Packer in the
past.
If the buyer is Mr Packer, the purchase would increase his stake in Fairfax
to almost 10 per cent. Nine Network Australia, a television network
controlled by Mr Packer, bought a 4.98 per cent stake last month for
ADollars 49.7m.
Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), Mr Packer's privately-owned master
company, refused to comment, but analysts said the purchase was almost
certainly made by CPH or a subsidiary company.
The identity of the buyer must be revealed to the Australian Stock Exchange
(ASX) today, unless the new owner of the shares is a private company. In
that case, the buyer could remain unidentified until next week.
Mr Packer has said that he would like to control Fairfax, which publishes
the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age, the Australian Financial
Review, and a chain of magazines and provincial newspapers.
He was a member of the Tourang consortium, which acquired the group from the
receiver for ADollars 1.4bn in 1991, but withdrew before the completion of
the sale after regulatory authorities launched an inquiry.
The remaining partners in Tourang were Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment
bank, and The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Hollinger, Mr
Black's Canadian master company.
Hellman &amp; Friedman has a 5 per cent stake in Fairfax, and The Telegraph has
15 per cent and management control. The government will rule shortly on an
application by The Telegraph to increase its stake to 25 per cent.
Under Australia's cross-media ownership law, Mr Packer will be limited to a
14.99 per cent shareholding in Fairfax unless he reduces his stake in Nine
Network from 48 per cent to less than 15 per cent.
Mr Packer would have to convince the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA)
that he could not exercise control of more than one leading media group with
the assistance of associates or other shareholders.
Mr Black said he would regard an investment in Fairfax by Mr Packer as a
vote of confidence.

<TEXT>
NBC NEWS is expected to name CBS News producer Mr Andrew Lack as president
in an effort to restore its tarnished reputation after the rigging of a
broadcast test of a General Motors truck last year.
There has been widespread speculation about who will head the news division
since March, when the third-ranking television network announced the
resignation of the division's president, Mr Michael Gartner. Mr Lack
appeared to be the front-runner yesterday.
Mr Lack, 45, who has been at CBS News for 16 years, was named executive
producer of CBS's prime-time news magazine show, Street Stories, this year.
He also produces specials and is credited with reviving CBS's documentaries
with a string of successes, including Malcolm X: The Real Story, Remember
Pearl Harbor and Watergate: The Secret Story.
NBC, a unit of General Electric, had to apologise on air after it showed
pictures of a blazing GM truck without telling viewers that incendiary
devices had been attached to make the truck burst into flames in a
collision.

beat forecasts
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the largest US carmaker, said yesterday its first-quarter
sales had been stronger than predicted, and it expected to post improved
results for the period. It is due to report its earnings later this month,
and analysts expect an operating profit of around Dollars 550m.
'I think it's going to be a good quarter,' Mr Jack Smith, the company's
chief executive, told journalists at the New York motor show. In the first
quarter of 1992, GM returned to a modest Dollars 179m profit after tax, its
first quarterly surplus since the second quarter of 1990.
The group's performance during March, Mr Smith added, had been 'really
pleasing', and car market shares had been 'well ahead of our most optimistic
outlook'. GM shares, which had risen this week on relatively good sales for
March, closed up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 1/4 on Wall Street yesterday.
Mr Smith discussed several initiatives on the product development and
manufacturing front. He held out the possibility that GM would construct a
second production facility for Saturn small cars, and said it was working on
plans for a new generation minivan that would probably be sold both in North
America and Europe. He said the vehicle was expected to make its debut in
the 1997 model year.
GM plans later this year to add a third shift at the existing plant in
Spring Hill, Tennessee, to lift production to 300,000 cars a year. However,
it believes that further additional capacity will be needed. Mr Smith gave
no indication, however, of where a second plant might be located.
He added that GM was studying ways of expanding production of its European
small car, the Corsa, currently built in Spain, to other countries within
Europe and possibly North America.
Mr Smith said it was 'possible' that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
until recently GM's worldwide purchasing chief, had taken confidential
papers concerning GM's European strategy to Volkswagen.
'We don't totally know,' said Mr Smith. Mr Lopez joined VW last month, and
six European colleagues subsequently quit to join him. GM has since extended
contract arrangements with key executives.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, is appealing against last
week's Ontario court decision refusing to declare the Gemini computerised
reservations system insolvent. PWA had sought the insolvency ruling as part
of its survival strategy.
American Airlines plans to make a CDollars 246m (USDollars 195m) equity
infusion into Canadian, but insists that Canadian switch from Gemini to its
own Sabre reservation system. Canadian and rival Air Canada, together with
another small US airline, own Gemini.
The court found that PWA was trying to get out of the partnership in order
to complete its deal with American.
PWA denied that the insolvency suit was related to the American link-up, but
would not reveal the basis for its appeal.
Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Air Canada, said a merger with Canadian was
still the best solution to the problems of the Canadian airline industry. It
would create one large Canadian international airline capable of competing
globally, he said.
If the Canadian-American airlines link were approved by Ottawa, he added,
Air Canada would become 'as weak as Canadian is today'.
SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing international computer systems integrator
formerly linked with BCE of Canada, will manage Canada Post's data
processing and telecommunications operations in a contract worth more than
CDollars 500m. Last year, Systemhouse signed a Dollars 550m out-sourcing
contract with Mexico's finance ministry.
It will expand the Canada Post data processing centre in Ottawa, instal new
networks and take over mail tracking and administrative functions.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, Europe's largest brewer, cautioned investors yesterday against
excessive expectations for short-term profits, but said it remained
confident about the outlook for long-term profitability.
The statement sparked a 3.1 per cent decline in Heineken's shares, which
have hit a series of record highs recently to become one of the Amsterdam
stock exchange's top performers over the past 12 months. They closed down Fl
16.10 at Fl 190.90 yesterday.
Mr Gerard van Schaik, chairman, said at the annual report presentation that
the company's short-term caution reflected sluggish economic growth in
Europe - where Heineken generates 75 per cent of sales - as well as higher
duties on alcohol in a number of European countries, both of which could
exert pressure on major beer markets.
Its second most important market, the US, appears to be developing
favourably, though alcohol duties may also be set to rise.
'However, our company has strong brands and sufficient financial strength to
see it through a period which may be less favourable economically,' Mr van
Schaik said.
'Our expectations for long-term profitability remain positive,' he added.
Last month, Heineken reported a 12.9 per cent rise in 1992 net profit to Fl
463m. If extraordinary gains from a property sale are included, the
improvement was even more marked, with net profit up 27.4 per cent at Fl
564m.
Mr van Schaik added that Heineken's volume sales rose by 2.3 per cent in
1992 to 53.7m hectolitres, a performance which he said none of its
international competitors had been able to match.

MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, has cut the 1992 bonuses paid
to its leading executives by between 30 per cent and 45 per cent, despite
making record profits, according to its annual proxy statement to
shareholders.
A company spokeswoman said that the bank's performance relative to the rest
of the securities industry had not been as strong as previously, and this
was one of several factors which went into the compensation equation.
Securities firms with retail operations had tended to perform better in 1992
than those with an institutional client bias, she added.
Mr Richard Fisher and Mr Robert Greenhill, respectively chairman and
president of the group, each received compensation of Dollars 6.25m, down 20
per cent from Dollars 7.81m in 1991. Their bonuses were cut 41 per cent to
Dollars 2.86m.
At Merrill Lynch, the largest US brokerage firm, Mr William Schreyer,
chairman, saw his cash compensation rise 16 per cent to Dollars 5.2m, while
Mr Donald Marron of PaineWebber received Dollars 7.7m, up more than 50 per
cent.
Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary under President George Bush, is joining
Morgan Stanley's board.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: United cuts another Dollars
5.5bn spending

<TEXT>
UNITED AIRLINES, one of the 'big three' US carriers, is to cut Dollars 5.5bn
from its capital spending plans over the next three years, by delaying
deliveries of 49 new Boeing aircraft.
This comes on top of the Dollars 3.6bn cut which the carrier announced last
year, through the deferral of 122 Boeing aircraft deliveries in the
1992-1995 period.
United announced the outcome of its latest round of negotiations with the
Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer yesterday, and confirmed that it would
take delivery of 11 of the new 777 wide-body aircraft in 1995 as planned.
However, the delivery schedule for the jets will be revised in later years.
United is a launch customer for the 777, and discussions between the two
companies have been watched particularly closely for this reason.
As far as the 49 aircraft are concerned, United said it would convert these
firm orders into options. These would be exercisable in the 1996-99 period,
whereas the orders would have been delivered between 1993 and 1996. United
would, however, lose 'significant deposits' if it failed to take delivery of
the aircraft before the year 2000.
The aircraft involved are 31 737s, eight 747-400s, two 757-200s and eight
767-300ERs.
United will now take only five Boeing 777s in 1996, instead of nine. Two of
the last four aircraft, originally due to arrive in 1996, will be
rescheduled for delivery in 1998, and two will be delivered in 1999. These
rescheduled aircraft will also be converted from the shorter-range 'A'
version, which United had ordered, to the longer-range 'B' version.
Yesterday, United's chairman, Mr Stephen Wolf, stressed that his airline
would take no new Boeing deliveries until the 777 is introduced in May 1995,
and again blamed 'the immense economic problems' confronting the airline
industry for the cuts. 'Any decision to reinstate these orders will be based
on United's ability to achieve appropriate levels of profitability,' he
said.
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier and close to emerging
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, is projecting an operating profit of
almost Dollars 170m between May and the end of the year, although it will
have been loss-making up until April.
Finance executives also told the bankruptcy court that the airline's
projections suggest operating profits of almost Dollars 270m in 1994, rising
to more than Dollars 440m by 1996.
American Airlines said it would reduce to 76 the number of daily flights
from its San Jose hub by July. It currently operates 124 flights daily.
Southwest Airlines, the smaller but successful low-cost carrier, has said it
will begin flying from the Californian city, but American said the
retrenchment had been planned before that announcement. Aeroflot, the
Russian airline, is working on a joint venture with US investors to create a
worldwide cargo network, Reuter reports.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: New structure for FT-A World
Indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN DICKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW structure of industrial sector classifications for the FT-Actuaries
World Indices has been published in draft form by the World Index Policy
Committee, which supervises the rules and operation of the FT-AWI. An
outline of the new structure appears below.
The new structure will classify companies into six new economic sectors  -
resources, utilities, manufacturing, consumer products, services and
financial activities.
At the more detailed levels, industry sectors and sub-sectors have been
reviewed, in some cases redefined, and fitted into this framework.
The committee, chaired by Mr Richard Pain, of the Institute of Actuaries,
believes that the resulting new structure more accurately represents the
pattern of international business.
The review leading up to the new structure is the first complete reappraisal
of FT-AWI industrial classifications since the World Index was launched in
March 1987. It forms part of the Policy Committee's responsibility for
ensuring that the indices remain a relevant measure of performance for the
international investment community.
Under new commercial agreements signed last month by the Financial Times,
Goldman, Sachs and NatWest Securities, and the Institute of Actuaries and
Faculty of Actuaries, the committee is being enlarged and its independence
from the commercial parties has been enhanced by the adoption of a formal
constitution.
Although the process of re-evaluating individual companies' classifications
is not yet complete, the outline will allow investors to judge whether the
new system would provide a better measure of evaluating their portfolio
performance than the current classification structure.
Comments from users of the FT-AWI will be welcomed and should be addressed,
together with other enquiries, to Symon Bradford at NatWest Securities,
Edinburgh (031-243-4258), or to Mark Zurack or Barbara Mueller at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., New York (212-902-6777).
Adrian Dicks is Manager, FT Statistics, and represents The Financial Times
on the World Index Policy Committee.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: PWA appeals against court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, is appealing against last
week's Ontario court decision refusing to declare the Gemini computerised
reservations system insolvent. PWA had sought the insolvency ruling as part
of its survival strategy.
American Airlines plans to make a CDollars 246m (USDollars 195m) equity
infusion into Canadian, but insists that Canadian switch from Gemini to its
own Sabre reservation system. Canadian and rival Air Canada, together with
another small US airline, own Gemini.
The court found that PWA was trying to get out of the partnership in order
to complete its deal with American.
PWA denied the insolvency suit was related to the American link-up, but
would not reveal the basis for its appeal.
Mr Hollis Harris, chairman of Air Canada, said a merger with Canadian was
still the best solution to the problems of the Canadian airline industry. It
would create one large Canadian international airline capable of competing
globally, he said.
If the Canadian-American airlines link were approved by Ottawa, he added,
Air Canada would become 'as weak as Canadian is today'.
SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing international computer systems integrator
formerly linked with BCE of Canada, will manage Canada Post's data
processing and telecommunications operations in a contract worth more than
CDollars 500m. Last year, Systemhouse signed a Dollars 550m out-sourcing
contract with Mexico's finance ministry.
Since BCE sold its 21 per cent holding in January, Systemhouse has moved
aggressively into international outsourcing. Its stock is widely held in
North America and it is expanding its European operations.
Systemhouse is now profitable, and Mr John Oltman, president, forecasts
annual revenues would reach CDollars 3bn in several years, up from CDollars
738m in the fiscal year ended August 31 1992. E. M. Warburg Pincus, the New
York investment bank, invested CDollars 40m in Systemhouse in a private
placement in February.
Power Financial, the financial services arm of Montreal financier Mr Paul
Desmarais's Power Corp of Canada, reported a rise in 1992 net profits to
CDollars 184.9m, or CDollars 2.90 a share, up from CDollars 159.7m, or
CDollars 1.77, in 1991.
Contributions from subsidiaries were slightly lower because of a
restructuring charge by Great-West Life.
The share of earnings of the European affiliate, Pargesa Holding, was
CDollars 34.3m, against CDollars 22.7m last time. Pargesa is jointly
controlled with Albert Frere of Belgium.
Cambior, the gold and base metals producer, has raised CDollars 84m of new
equity by selling 6m units at CDollars 14 per unit to an underwriting group
led by RBC Dominion Securities. Each unit comprises one Cambior common share
and one-half a share purchase warrant. One full warrant entitles the holder
to buy one Cambior share at CDollars 15.50 per share until June 30 1995.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: BBL chooses insurance partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian bank, yesterday deftly put an end to
18 months of speculation about several possible partners for its insurance
activities. It has finally selected Royale Belge and Winterthur - the
Belgian and Swiss insurers - as the company to help it develop insurance
products.
The decision may call into question the involvement in BBL of Internationale
Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services company.
Internationale Nederlanden Groep spent most of last year examining a
possible bid for the bank.
ING, which owns a 10 per cent stake in BBL, eventually decided that the
price was too high to launch a takeover, but the Dutch group nevertheless
still hoped to collaborate in the expanding field of 'bancassurance'.
Yesterday, BBL said that Royale Belge and Winterthur, both of which have
stakes in the company, would be given prime responsibility for the
reinsurance of risks taken on by BBL Life and BBL Insurance, the bank's
insurance subsidiaries.
The association would help reduce risks and lighten solvency demands, said
the bank.
ING was not available for comment. Three weeks ago, Belgian newspapers
reported that Mr Aad Jacobs, ING's chairman, was on record as having said
that he would consider it an 'unfriendly' gesture if the Dutch company were
to be excluded from bancassurance developments with BBL.
The framework agreement with Royale Belge, nearly 50 per cent of which is
controlled by UAP, the French insurer, and Winterthur will last for at least
five years. The agreement is also 'linked to the stability of the bank's
share register', BBL emphasised in a statement yesterday.
Royale Belge and Winterthur will also be given priority for the underwriting
of other non-BBL insurance products, although BBL said that there would
still be some room for collaboration with its other insurance company
shareholders.
BBL, which is one of Belgium's three largest banks, last month announced
that its net consolidated profits had dropped to BFr3.6bn in the 15 months
to the end of 1992. That compares with BFr4.5bn in the 12 months to the end
of September 1991.

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Michelin gloomy despite profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyremaker, is to launch a another cost-cutting
plan in spite of a profit of FFr79m (Dollars 14.6m) in 1992.
After losses of FFr4.8bn in 1990 and FFr699m in 1991, last year's small
profit came on worldwide sales which were steady in terms of volume, but
fell by 1.2 per cent in value to FFr66.8bn because of the decline in the US
dollar and several European currencies against the French franc.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, the finance director, said the group was
aiming to save FFr3.5bn over the next two years. He did not rule out further
job losses, particularly in Europe. The company made 16,000 redundancies in
1991-92 and introduced short-time working in its French factories.
Michelin forecast that, if the second quarter of this year showed no
improvement over the first quarter, it would record a loss for the first six
months of 1993.
In spite of the poor economic climate, sales of replacement tyres can
increase as car and truck owners use their existing vehicles longer instead
of buying new ones, Michelin said. The fall in the European market in the
second half of last year offset the upturn in the US market and virtually
wiped out its first-half profit of FFr820m.
The company is paying a FFr1.60 dividend on its fully-paid A shares. and
FFr1.50 on B shares.
With its Uniroyal-Goodrich operations in the US, Michelin claimed to have
maintained last year its 20 per cent share of the world market, against
Bridgestone with 16.5 per cent and Goodyear with 16 per cent.
The company's gloomy predictions for 1993 helped send its shares down in
early trading on the Paris bourse, even though Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere
yesterday ruled out any early capital increase, a possibility that had
recently depressed Michelin stock.

group's 74 industrial companies; many joint ventures with big foreign names.
Turnover increased 20 per cent to Dollars 11.2bn in 1992 (Dollars 9.4bn),

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Swissair leads airline merger
negotiations

<TEXT>
SWISSAIR yesterday claimed to be leading the negotiations among four
medium-sized European airlines that could result in their merger.
'The initiative is on our side, even if we are more reserved than some
others,' Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said at the Swiss airline group's annual
press conference.
The airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System,
Austrian Airlines and Swissair, announced in January that they were studying
ways of intensifying co-operation to improve their competitiveness.
The other airlines have speculated on the talks, but Swissair has said
nothing. The negotiations were very complex and decisions could not be
reached quickly, Mr Loepfe said yesterday.
Mr Hannes Goetz, chairman, said Swissair's objective in the negotiations was
to increase the 'mutual commitment' of the partners to each other. A merger
was possible, but it would take a long time and would threaten traffic
rights.
'We would like to look for a form of company which could be established
without the need for any change in national airline legislation or any loss
of traffic rights,' Mr Goetz said. He added that the discussions were
focusing on a decentralised model for operations, and that Swissair intended
to maintain its global identity.
Its existing co-operation agreements with Delta Air Lines of the US and
Singapore Airlines were vital to this strategy, he added.
Mr Loepfe predicted that many long-established airlines would disappear in
the near future 'at least in their present form', but Swissair would not be
one of them.
He said that if a co-operation plan among the four European airlines went
ahead, then the four would decide which was the best US partner.
Mr Loepfe said Swissair was confident that it would make a profit this year.

produce sports vehicle

<TEXT>
AUDI, the Volkswagen group's quality car subsidiary, will shortly launch a
model developed and built in collaboration with Porsche, the sports car
specialist.
The newcomer would be unveiled in September with deliveries starting next
year, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, Audi chief executive said yesterday.
The venture would help to stabilise lossmaking Porsche, but association with
such a high-quality manufacturer would help Audi to establish itself
alongside Mercedes-Benz and BMW as a top marque.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chief executive, is a member of the family
which controls Porsche. Last week, he unveiled a DM1.25bn (Dollars 781m)
first-quarter loss for the group. He was head of Audi until the end of last
year.
Audi had fallen into loss in the first quarter, Mr Kortum said, during which
production had been slashed 42 per cent to 76,000 cars. But in contrast to
the parent, which is aiming to break even in the full 12 months, Audi was
well placed to show a profit, he said.
Deliveries to customers in the first three months of this year, down 31 per
cent at 95,000 vehicles had been partly maintained from stocks built up
after the downturn in the second half of 1992.
Sales in Germany were so far down 37 per cent at 43,000 units and turnover
had fallen 36 per cent to DM2.8bn.
Full 1992 figures, released yesterday, showed net profits down to DM172m
from DM370m on record turnover of DM16.7bn and peak deliveries of 490,000
cars.
For this year, Audi expected to benefit from lower input costs from
co-ordinated buying and job cuts. Some 4,000 of the 37,700 workers are
expected to go, bringing the workforce down to levels last seen 10 years
ago, when the company made 380,000 cars a year.
'The joint venture with Porsche makes it self-evident that we are talking
about a very sporty vehicle,' Mr Kortum added. The car will be sold under
the Audi badge and based on an existing production model.

L'OREAL, the largest cosmetics company, mustered a 16 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to FFr4bn (Dollars 741m) in 1992 from FFr3.45bn in 1991.
Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, chairman and chief executive, said that the group had
overcome difficult economic climate due to new products, notably the Lancome
skin care range and Tresor, the fragrance, and a strong performance from the
Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary.
L'Oreal is subject to speculation about its ownership. The group is
controlled by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, the founder's daughter, who owns 51
per cent of Gesparal, the holding company that controls 55 per cent of
L'Oreal's shares. Nestle, the Swiss food group, owns the remaining 49 per
cent of Gesparal and hopes to secure control of L'Oreal.
L'Oreal saw consolidated sales rise by 12.3 per cent to FFr37.57bn last year
from FFr33.44bn in 1991, with net operating profits rising by 19.8 per cent
to FFr2.59bn from FFr2.16bn. Earnings per share rose to FFr 39.50 from
FFr34.70 The dividend increased to FFr9.60 from FFr8.40.

forecast

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group,
yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent rise in net profits for last year, slightly
higher than the 12 per cent rise it had forecast.
Net earnings rose to FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) last year from FFr6.2bn in 1991
and should be stable this year, in spite of the difficult economic climate,
said Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman. Turnover rose fractionally to FFr161.7bn
from FFr160bn.
He expected growth in the telecommunications market, the group's biggest
business, accounting for nearly half of last year's sales. Europe would show
slight progression, but much faster growth would come from Asia and Latin
America, where the number of telephone lines should more than double over
the next 10 years, said Mr Suard.
Last year's net profits increase was achieved on a small decline in
operating profits to FFr14.8bn from FFr14.9bn, he said. It came in spite of
a rise in restructuring costs, to FFr3.2bn from FFr2.7bn, and an increase in
financial charges. Net debt nearly doubled to FFr20.5bn from FFr10.8bn due
to the costs of buying out ITT's 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the group's
telecommunications division.
Operating profits in telecommunications rose slightly to FFr9.5bn, while the
GEC Alsthom energy and transport division, owned jointly with Britain's GEC,
saw a rise in operating earnings to FFr3.6bn from FFr3.1bn. The joint
venture, formed in 1988, was starting to show synergies, said Mr Suard.
The cables division produced a slight rise in operating profits to FFr2.7bn
as did Cegelec, in electrical engineering, where profits were FFr470m. Saft,
the battery making division, produced a small operating rise to FFr120m.
Alcatel Alsthom is proposing a FFr21.75 annual dividend, up from FFr20.25
last year.
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to FFr53.2 in 1992.
Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest provider of software services, yesterday
said it would pay no dividend for 1992, the first time it has missed a
pay-out. The group revealed a FFr72m loss last year, its first annual
deficit, though less than the FFr80m loss it had earlier estimated for 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sherwood Computer yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 23 per cent from
Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 3m for 1992.
Turnover fell to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 21.7m) mainly because of the
transformation in 1991 of a former subsidiary into a joint venture,
Guardian, with ICL. Sherwood gained Pounds 285,000 income from its stake in
Guardian.
An increased final dividend of 5.25p brings the total for the year to 7p
(6p), payable from earnings per share of 34.1p (24.7p).
The results were prepared using FRS 3 guidelines.
Operating costs fell to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 20.1m). The company made a
Pounds 1.2m charge for the BS5750 quality certificate - mainly comprised of
employees' time and external consultants.
It also incurred a Pounds 500,000 charge through switching the company
pension scheme from a final salary scheme to a group money purchase scheme.
Mr Richard Guy, chairman, said the new scheme was more suitable for the
young, mobile staff employed by the company.

Against a depressed market background, Mid-States, the wholesaler and
distributor of motor parts in the US, raised pre-tax profits by 13 per cent
from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 4.21m in 1992. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds
48.9m to Pounds 50.1m.
As already announced, the company has appointed Bear Stearnsto investigate
ways of maximising shareholder value. The review, however, is still in
progress.
The company said that in view of the wide ranging nature of the strategic
alternatives being considered, it believed it inappropriate to declare a
final dividend and so the interim of 0.75p compares with the previous year's
total of 3p.
A special interim, however, will be declared when the outcome of the
strategic review is known.
Earnings per share rose by 1p to 7.3p.

Martin International Holdings, the clothing group and supplier to Marks and

2.38m to Pounds 2.45m pre-tax over 1992 despite recession affecting its main
markets.
Turnover improved to Pounds 83.4m (Pounds 80m), but profits at the operating
level dipped to Pounds 3.93m (Pounds 4.06m).
Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, said that following rationalisation the UK showed
some improvement in the second half, but that margins were lower in overseas
activities.
'It is difficult at this time to see any immediate recovery from the trading
conditions which applied in 1992,' he said.
Net borrowings at the year-end amounted to Pounds 8.7m, representing gearing
of about 40 per cent (42 per cent).
The cost of withdrawal from certain activities amounted to Pounds 1.18m,
taken as an extraordinary charge, and included Pounds 900,000 relating to
the closure of the Queensbridge factory.
A proposed final of 2.7p holds the total at 4.4p, covered 1.9 times by
earnings of 8.4p (9.5p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAGENHAM Motors Group, the London and south-east main Ford dealer, finished
1992 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.48m, a reduction of 30 per cent on
the previous Pounds 2.11m.
In November, the group warned that second half profits were likely to fall
short of market expectations; in the event they came to Pounds 357,000.
The final dividend is held at 4p for an unchanged total of 5.75p, from
earnings per share of 5.6p (8.1p).
Mr David Philip, chairman, said it was again a difficult year, particularly
the last quarter when most manufacturers were discounting heavily.
However, improvements in working practices, acquisition of new outlets and
weakening of competition enabled the group to lift turnover 23 per cent to
Pounds 155.9m.
New car sales increased 30 per cent to 7,723 units and used car sales by 22
per cent to 6,290.
Mr Philip said profits in the first quarter of the current year were ahead
with all nine dealerships profitable. Trading at Brownings Electric and
Dagenham Motors Security had been satisfactory.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Nurdin moving into US style shopping clubs
 -Recession and Sunday trading hit 1992 sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NURDIN &amp; PEACOCK, the cash and carry wholesaler, yesterday ended months of
speculation as it announced plans to introduce US-style shopping clubs in
the UK.
The company, which also announced a 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 27.6m), plans to open its first club
warehouse next spring, at a total cost of about Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m. A
second site is planned for later in the year.
Club warehouses are a popular retailing strategy in the US, where customers
pay a fee to become members and are entitled to discount shopping on items
such as food, clothes and electrical goods. Since 1986 total club sales are
estimated to have grown from Dollars 7.3bn to Dollars 34.7bn (Pounds 24.4bn)
last year, with more than 21m people holding membership cards.
Nurdin plans a similar format to that in the US. Mr David Poole, managing
director, said the group aimed to open two clubs a year. It could link up
with a joint venture partner to accelerate that programme but no party had
yet been approached.
Mr Poole said it was unlikely that Nurdin would link up with Makro, the cash
and carry business of Dutch company SHV, which holds 14 per cent of the UK
company. 'Any linkage with SHV would severely damage our reputation with our
retailing customers in the UK,' he said. However, some sort of sourcing
agreement for the clubs was not ruled out.
The new strategy comes as the group reported a 4 per cent decline in
like-for-like sales for the 53 weeks to January 1 1993. Overall, however,
there was a 5.5 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.44bn. This
included contributions from three new branches, for a total of 46. The
period compares with 52 weeks to December 31 1992; the three extra trading
days added 1 per cent to sales.
Mr Nigel Hall, finance director, said the decline in comparable sales
stemmed from the impact of recession and Sunday trading on independent
retailers - which account for more than 50 per cent of the group's turnover.
However, an improvement in operating margins from 1.7 per cent to 1.9 per
cent helped boost profits at the trading level by 14 per cent to Pounds
27.3m.
Mr Hall said he expected margins to improve further in the current year.
The final dividend is 4.16p for a total of 6.12p (5.56p). Earnings per
share, helped by a lower tax charge, rose from 15p to 17p.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hunting jumps to Pounds 29m and calls for
Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the aviation, defence and oil services company, yesterday launched
a Pounds 36.8m rights issue to reduce debt and provide working capital for
its newly won contract to manage the government's Atomic Weapons
Establishment.
Shareholders are being offered two new shares for nine held at 185p, a 17.2
per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price prevailing on Tuesday
night.
Hunting's share price closed down 8p yesterday at 230p.
The Hunting family, which currently controls just under 40 per cent of the
shares, will not be taking up its rights - which are being placed at 19p
nil-paid.
In addition, the family also yesterday sold 1.55m shares to reduce debts of
the family controlled investment company. As a result the family's interest
will fall to just below 30 per cent of the enlarged capital, ending
effective Hunting control and increasing the previously restricted liquidity
in the shares.
Hunting announced the rights issue on the back of pre-tax profits for 1992
ahead from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 29.2m on an FRS 3 basis. Sales rose 8 per
cent to Pounds 809.8m.
Operating profits were Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 32.5m) after a Pounds 1.1m loss
on the businesses sold to Williams Holdings in February. Hunting will,
however, book a Pounds 6m exceptional profit this year on this sale.
Gearing at the year end was 78 per cent. However, without the rights issue,
Aldermaston would have pushed gearing above 100 per cent. Gearing will still
be about 50 per cent after the rights issue.
At the operational level, aviation profits dipped to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds
11.1m), partly because of problems with avionics. Defence fell to Pounds
9.3m (Pounds 10.5m) but Hunting believes that even without the AWE contract,
this division's decline has been arrested. Profits in the oil division
increased to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 11.3m) as Canada continued to perform
well.
Earnings came through at 17.5p (6.8p) per share diluted, and a final
dividend of 6p is proposed for an unchanged 10p total.
COMMENT
With yesterday's rights issue, Hunting has strengthened its weakest flank -
the balance sheet - and done it to support growth, not rationalisation.
Coming on top of the sale of its consumer products side to Williams, the
Aldermaston contract, and signs of real growth in the oil division, Hunting
appears to have put together a varied collection of businesses that could
prove significantly more interesting than its current rating would suggest.
On normalised pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m this year, and earnings of
17.8p, the rating is a modest 13 times. However, the Aldermaston contract is
of such a significant size, with sales probably about Pounds 250m, that
investors may want to wait to see that it fulfils the promise that has so
excited Hunting's board.

With the Irish insurance activities remaining the mainstay of the business,
FBD Holdings lifted pre-tax profits 23 per cent in 1992, from IPounds 9.33m
to IPounds 11.5m.
The final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 4.5p, a rise of 25 per cent over
the previous 3.6p. Earnings per share were 17.47p (13.02p).
Insurance pre-tax profits came to IPounds 8.8m (IPounds 9.2m), after writing
off IPounds 800,000 realised losses on stocks and shares. Market share was
increased and the customer base broadened. Underwriting losses were cut by
IPounds 300,000 to IPounds 3.2m.
A significant improvement came from property, leisure, IFSC and other
activities.
Net profit was IPounds 2.7m, against IPounds 100,000 which included a
write-down of IPounds 1.1m in property values. Most of the increase stemmed
from better sales of properties in Spain and Ireland.
The balance sheet had to take a IPounds 4.2m reduction in quoted investments
and exchange translation. The decline has largely been reversed since the
year-end.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Blockleys tumbles to Pounds 352,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLOCKLEYS, the Shropshire-based brick and pavior manufacturer, suffered a
further downturn in 1992 as recession continued to take its toll on the
construction industry.
On turnover down by Pounds 1m to Pounds 9.3m, pre-tax profits were Pounds
352,000, against Pounds 1.06m.
Mr Brian Taylor, chairman and managing director, said the UK brick industry
saw both production and sales fall by some 6 per cent, while stocks of
bricks rose to a new peak of 1.54bn at the year end.
There is still no real indication of any recovery in the construction
industry, he said, and the forecast for sales of bricks in 1993 was only 2.5
per cent above the 1992 level.
Staff numbers have been cut by 45, leading to an exceptional charge of
Pounds 85,000.
A final dividend of 0.5p (1.43p) makes a total of 1p (3.38p). The dividend
is uncovered by earnings per share of 0.73p (2.48p).

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Campaign to save Clark launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN against the sale of C&amp;J Clark, the family owned shoe
manufacturer, was officially launched yesterday with a letter to 300
shareholders urging them to resist the board's proposals.
Shareholders Opposed to Enforced Sale (Shoes), run by five Clark family
members, urged investors not to sell at a price reflecting 'the  .. past
rather than the future.'
The letter points to Clark's recent results, showing a fall in debt and a
net asset value of 278p per share. 'This does not include the value of the
brand,' the letter states. Berisford is believed to be offering about 205p.
Mr Charles Robertson, of Shoes, said many shareholders were upset over how
the sale proposal had been handled. 'Shareholders are disaffected because
they were not properly informed,' he said.
The letter urged those wanting to sell to resist the temptation. 'Even those
who favour a sale should recognise this is a particularly inopportune time
to sell.'

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Pelican seeks Pounds 7.4m to fund purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PELICAN Group is paying Mr Robert Earl, who made his fortune creating
the Hard Rock Cafe chain, Pounds 6m for four UK restaurants. The purchase
will be funded by a Pounds 7.4m placing and open offer.
The Mamma Amalfi restaurants and Rock Island Diner had warranted pre-tax
profits of Pounds 800,000 in the year ended March 31 against Pounds 767,000
a year earlier.
Pelican will pay the vendor, Worldwide Leisure Holdings, controlled by a
trust which benefits Mr Earl's family, Pounds 3m in Pelican shares and
Pounds 3m in cash.
The open offer to shareholders is on a 7-for-10 basis at 50p per share.
After Pounds 400,000 of expenses, Pelican will retain Pounds 4m cash from
the fund raising. The shares closed yesterday up 8p at 58p.
At the same time Mr Richard Myers, Pelican chairman, is placing 800,000
shares, at 50p apiece, to repay a personal bank loan.
Pelican will also receive Pounds 75,000 a year for three years from licence
agreements.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Mowlem losses grow to Pounds 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Mowlem, the contractor, is strengthening its balance sheet with the
Pounds 52m sale of its HSS tool hire business, which it announced yesterday
alongside deepening pre-tax losses.
The pre-tax deficit grew from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 27.2m last year after
Pounds 4.8m losses at London City Airport and a further Pounds 20.2m of
reorganisation costs and write-offs. The final dividend is cut from 4.85p to
2p, leaving a total of 4p (10.5p). Losses per share were 20.7p (9.4p).
Sir Philip Beck, chairman, said the HSS disposal, to Davis Service Group,
cut year-end net debt from Pounds 69.1m to about Pounds 17m and gearing to 9
per cent. Since then there had been a seasonal increase in borrowings of
about Pounds 24m.
The sale price was about 57 per cent of the group's market value at
yesterday's opening price of 85p. It gained 3p to close at 88p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 1.25bn (Pounds 1.37bn) and operating profit to
Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 19.3m). This partly reflected the tightening squeeze on
contracting, but also a sharp fall in profits from scaffolding hire.
Housebuilding slipped into losses and the airport registered a deficit after
using up provisions.
In contracting, the group had no large loss-makers. It concentrated on
smaller regional contracts. The division's Pounds 904m (Pounds 1.05bn)
turnover was expected to hold steady this year. Profit after interest income
declined to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 26.5m).
The SGB scaffolding business saw profits fall to Pounds 5m (Pounds 11.4m).
This division bore the brunt of the Pounds 9.3m reorganisation charges.
Housebuilding lost Pounds 1.4m and the land bank was further written down at
an exceptional cost of Pounds 5.2m. About Pounds 23m was brought in from
property development sales.
COMMENT
Mowlem's sale of HSS met a mixed reception. On the one hand, it gives
balance sheet strength that would be the envy of Costain or Taylor Woodrow
and underpins the ability to maintain the dividend. On the other hand, it
has got rid of its highest margin business and one that should come out of
recession earliest. Sir Philip's talk of selling a cash absorbing business
smacks of battening down the hatches on the core contracting arm, which
points to the long haul back to decent margins in that industry. Mowlem
does, however, deserve credit for avoiding black-hole contracts and looks
one of the better bets in that sector - long term, of course. Meanwhile
scaffolding's recovery is the main hope. The risks involved at London
airport are reflected in the failure so far to find a partner. A small loss
is expected this year before a goodwill hit resulting from the HSS sale.
Patient investors will hold the stock for the 5.7 per cent yield.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Savoy Hotel shows Pounds 1.4m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVOY HOTEL incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.43m in 1992, compared with a
profit of Pounds 2.27m last time.
Turnover of the group, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's, the
Berkeley and the Connaught, fell from Pounds 79.2m to Pounds 76.8m.
With low interest rates and inflation, and an exchange rate which is
attractive to US visitors, 'there is a reasonable chance that 1993 will be a
better year than 1992,' said Mr Giles Shepard, managing director.
The dividend is held at 7p per A share and 3.5p per B share, because of the
more optimistic economic outlook and the cover of previous years.
Losses were 1.3p per A share (earnings 17.5p) and 0.6p per B share (earnings
8.8p).
Mr Shepard said Pounds 9.6m had been spent on capital projects last year,
with improvements at the Savoy and Claridge's.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) falls 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Wilson (Connolly) rose 3p to 163p yesterday, despite the
announcement of a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profit by the UK housebuilder
and property developer and contractor.
The decline in profits from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 16.8m for 1992 was struck
after increased provisions of Pounds 5.49m (Pounds 2.02m). A final dividend
of 2.66p maintains the total at 3.93p. Earnings fell from 10.2p to 6.1p.
Mr Ian Black, managing director, said the dividend was 1.5 times covered by
post-tax profits. 'This was no mean feat in the longest and deepest
recession in living memory.'
Trading profits, before write- downs, fell 23 per cent to Pounds 22.3m
(Pounds 29.1m) despite a record 2,880 homes being sold.
Housing profits tumbled 29 per cent to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 25.7m). Profit
margins fell to 12 per cent reflecting price reductions of about 8 per cent.
The company, like other housebuilders, had seen sales increase during the
past few months. At the year-end the company had 13,300 building plots at an
average price of just Pounds 12,600 each.
Gearing of only 1 per cent meant the company was well placed to take
advantage of an upturn in the market. Construction fell from Pounds 3.03m to
Pounds 1.09m, on static sales of Pounds 36m. Commercial property surged from
Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 2.9m.
COMMENT
Bowden and Bryant have produced the best results in the current
housebuilding reporting season. They share long land banks supported by
strong balance sheets and appear to have chosen the right time to expand
output, with net reservations of housebuilders rising by between a fifth and
a quarter during the first three months of this year compared with 1992.
These virtues, however, have already been recognised in the companies' share
performance and it is difficult to justify a buy recommendation on a
prospective p/e, in Wilson Connolly's case, of 18 to 19 on prospective
profits this year of Pounds 22m-Pounds 24m.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lelliott in talks with bankers on future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LELLIOTT, one of Britain's biggest privately-owned construction
companies, was yesterday locked in talks with its bankers. A statement on
its future is expected today, writes Andrew Taylor.
The company ran into trouble following the failure of the Pounds 110m Point
West development of flats, offices, a health club and shops in the shell of
the former British Airways terminal in Cromwell Road, west London.
Lelliott, which was working on the project, is thought to have lost
approaching Pounds 10m as a result of the development being put into
receivership at the end of 1991.
Land &amp; Property Trust the property company developing Point West went into
liquidation shortly afterwards.
Lelliott has still not published its results for the 12 months to end-June
1992. In the previous year it made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 700,000 on
turnover of Pounds 193m. In 1989-90 it made profits of Pounds 5.8m on sales
of Pounds 240m.
It was ranked as Britain's 38th largest construction company by turnover -
and Europe's 144th largest - in a survey conducted last year by Building
Magazine.
Stone Group, the stone restoration subsidiary of Lelliott, was placed into
administrative receivership in February. It was subsequently acquired by the
Peter Cox Group.
Lelliott also recently reached an out-of-court settlement with Forte, the
hotel group, following a dispute over the Pounds 10.8m refurbishment of the
Waldorf Hotel, London.
Mr John Lelliott, chairman, is a director of Wimbledon football club.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill cuts final as loss is reduced
to Pounds 11.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGGS &amp; Hill, the UK construction and property group, yesterday halved its
final dividend after incurring a pre-tax loss for the second year running.
The loss for 1992 of Pounds 11.6m, however, was an improvement on the
previous year's Pounds 16.7m.
Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said there would have been a profit of
Pounds 340,000 but for provisions of Pounds 12m against commercial and
residential property operations. This followed a Pounds 20.9m provision in
1991 when trading profits were Pounds 4.22m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 345.2m to Pounds 293.2m.
The final dividend is cut to 1.5p, making a total of 2.5p (9p). It is
proposed to transfer Pounds 22.5m from reserves following a Pounds 23.7m
transfer in 1991.
Mr Theakston said the year finished with net cash of Pounds 4.1m compared
with net borrowings of Pounds 16.8m at the end of 1991.
The construction division, which saw sales slip 19 per cent from Pounds
309.4m to Pounds 250.8m, incurred a Pounds 2.22m trading loss (Pounds 2.61m
profit).
Housing trading profits increased from Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 2.52m helped
by higher sales - 262 units were sold against 235 - and better margins
following previous write-downs.
Despite the sale of a substantial office development west of Paris,
commercial property made a trading profit of just Pounds 35,000 compared
with Pounds 1.31m.
Mr George Duncan, chairman, said: 'We are hopeful that 1993 will mark the
turning point in the group's fortunes. There are now indications that the
housing market may be improving.'
COMMENT
It is quite clear what value Mr Tony Pidgley, Berkeley Group's managing
director, saw when he recently bought and sold 300,000 shares in Higgs &amp;
Hill, making a nifty profit in the process. The strength of the company is
its balance sheet; to have net cash at this stage of the cycle is admirable.
The trading outlook, however, remains difficult. Contracting margins are
likely to remain under pressure even though it is working hard to win better
quality business. The housing operation will get some benefit from recovery
but is relatively small. The company should break even or make a small
profit this year. The share price of 58p understates the written down value
of 156p. Buy for net asset value rather than for short-term earnings
improvement.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Government backs global market in BT share
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has abolished regional syndicates in its forthcoming sale of
BT shares in favour of one global market, with managers competing to sign up
the biggest institutional shareholders.
SG Warburg, global co-ordinator, yesterday confirmed that for the first time
in any UK privatisation, 11 global managers will compete with each other to
get the top 500 institutions around the world to put in bids for BT shares.
The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT
stake - worth more than Pounds 5bn. The sale may take place as early as
July.
In the last BT sale, the institutional offer was split between 10 syndicates
throughout the world in which the lead managers had exclusive rights, apart
from the global co-ordinator, to market the shares.
This time round Warburg will be responsible for running the book building
exercise in every region of the world.
The ten other global managers are Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove, Daiwa
Securities, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, NatWest
Securities, Paribas Capital Markets, NM Rothschild and UBS Limited.
Mr Maurice Thompson, a director of Warburg Securities, said: 'We hope this
will unleash competition within protected markets.' The global managers
'will keep their ears and eyes open' for any institutions which try to push
the BT share price down by deliberately selling short before the sale.
Warburgs reserved the right to 'penalise such action'.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Davis Service pays Pounds 52m for Mowlem
tool hire business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIS SERVICE Group is buying the HSS tool hire business from John Mowlem
for Pounds 52m to expand its core business after departing from car hire.
Davis is raising Pounds 34.7m in a vendor placing and raising the other
Pounds 17.3m as debt. The 16.9m new shares will expand Davis's equity by 20
per cent and existing shareholders can apply on a 1-for-5 basis.
The issue is priced at 205p, compared with yesterday's opening price of
228p. It gained 2p to close at 230p.
The HSS group made Pounds 4.76m operating profit last year on turnover of
Pounds 59.9m. About Pounds 38m of net assets are being acquired.
Mr John Ivey, Davis's chief executive, said the 170 HSS shops, serving the
small builder and DIY market, had provided sufficient profit to offset a
small loss in the other part of the acquisition, PB Plant Hire, aimed at
construction companies and utilities.
In 1990 the business had made Pounds 7.14m profit and it was PB that had
declined since then.
The acquisition would fit into the site services division, which mainly
supplies mobile buildings and last year contributed Pounds 3.42m to
operating profits of Pounds 19.4m from continuing activities.
Davis is also involved in providing laundry services, workwear and linen
hire, and cleaning. Mr Ivey said 75 per cent of the business was rental
based.
Last year the group substantially reduced its debt after selling the Godfrey
Davis car hire business. In December it had net borrowings of Pounds 10.1m,
giving gearing of 11 per cent.
After the acquisition and share issue pro forma net debt rose to about
Pounds 28m for gearing of 25 per cent.
Mr Ivey said the group had also arranged a new Pounds 30m revolving loan
facility, repayable between 1996 and 1998, 'to give us headroom' for further
modest expansion.
The placing is organised by Baring Brothers and Kleinwort Benson.

6.46m

<TEXT>
DEWHIRST Group, one of Marks and Spencer's main clothing suppliers, reported
improved margins in the year to January 15 1993 which pushed pre-tax profits
up from Pounds 4.13m to Pounds 6.46m.
Turnover was up from Pounds 130.5m to Pounds 181.6m but was swollen by the
inclusion for the first full year of a women's wear acquisition.
Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman, said Marks and Spencer last year took more than
80 per cent of output. He added that the company 'had a long way to go on
margins.'
Earnings rose to 3.52p (2.71p). The final dividend is 0.68p for a total of
1p (0.72p).

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stylo losses down to Pounds 746,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STYLO, the footwear group, yesterday announced a sharp reduction in pre-tax
losses from Pounds 9.06m to Pounds 746,000 for the year to January 30.
The improvement was achieved following the closure of the heavily
loss-making US operations.
Pre-tax profits from continuing businesses were Pounds 674,000 against a
deficit of Pounds 7.4m.
Sales rose 15 per cent to Pounds 105.5m, while the operating loss of Pounds
4.2m in 1992 was transformed to a profit of Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, said the profits improvement had been achieved in
spite of even more difficult conditions for the shoe trade. The outlook for
the UK retail division was encouraging, with turnover continuing to
increase.
Prospects for the wholesale sports division, selling golf and equestrian
footwear and clothing, were also better, he said.
Losses per share was substantially reduced from 42p to 4.01p. The dividend
on limited voting and management shares is lifted to 3p (2.5p).

FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Sherwood Group pays Pounds 19.6m
for bra maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERWOOD GROUP, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks maker, is
extending its acquisition programme to continental Europe with the L47.4bn
(Pounds 19.6m) purchase of an Italian bra manufacturer.
The deal will be funded by a Pounds 10.7m placing and open offer of shares
for cash.
At the same time, the company revealed pre-tax profits on continuing
operations for 1992 of Pounds 18.2m, an increase of 25 per cent on 1991's
Pounds 14.6m. The figures are on the FRS 3 basis.
Earnings per share were 11.7p (11p) and a final dividend of 1.7p raises the
total by 14 per cent to 2.6p. Turnover improved 22 per cent to Pounds 141m.
The acquisition is of 75 per cent of Lepel, a family-run business that
stands third in the Italian bra market.
The payment will be in two stages: the first L25bn (Pounds 10.3m) will be
paid on completion of the deal with the cash raised from the placing and
open offer, and the rest will be paid a year later from cash flow.
'Garments will then account for more than 50 per cent of sales, making a
better balance between lace and garments,' said Mr David Parker, chairman.
The deal will lift net debt from Pounds 25m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 30m
at the end of the current year, said Mr Peter Newbold, finance director. He
said, however, that gearing would remain at about 45 per cent.
The acquisition will immediately enhance earnings.
COMMENT
At eight times the exit p/e which enhances earnings from year one, Lepel
looks like a bargain. But the Italian market is tricky. Firstly, there is
black economy competition and the importance of personal contacts. Sherwood
has done its best to minimise the risk by leaving the Leporati family with a
25 per cent stake tying them into a five year contract. Secondly, there is a
structural change taking place in European clothes retailing. The
independent sector, Lepel's strength, is giving way to the chain store,
where larger companies excel. Sherwood and Lepel may be able to offset this
by venturing into export markets, but investors may want to wait until they
see the tie-up working. If it does, profits should climb above Pounds 23m
this year putting the shares on a p/e of 11.5. This makes them look cheap
and the open offer attractive.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARDLE Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment concern, yesterday
reported a fall in interim profits mainly because of lower interest earnings
and an accounting change.
Pre-tax profits fell from a restated Pounds 4.92m to Pounds 4.04m in the six
months to February 28.
The restatement, prompted by adopting FRS 3 led to the reclassification of a
Pounds 563,000 gain as exceptional rather than extraordinary, thereby
lifting the prior year figure.
Operating profits increased 3 per cent to Pounds 2.74m on unchanged turnover
of Pounds 38.2m.
Net cash fell slightly from Pounds 34m to Pounds 31.3m. Lower interest rates
meant net interest received fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.31m.
Earnings fell from an adjusted 14p to 10.9p. The company said it planned to
increase this year's dividend to compensate shareholders who would otherwise
lose out because of changes to the rates of ACT introduced following the
budget. The interim dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 5p.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Speyhawk Pounds 90m in red after
write-downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, the technically insolvent property developer which has been in
talks with its banks since August 1991, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 89.8m for the year to September 30 1992.
The deficit, which followed a Pounds 216.8m loss in the previous year,
mainly resulted from further write-downs of Pounds 67.3m against investment
and development properties.
'There has been little improvement in market conditions. Property values
have continued to fall, particularly in the City of London,' said Mr Trevor
Osborne, chairman.
Mr Osborne said he expected the refinancing of the group's Pounds 360m of
debt to be completed in a couple of months. Speyhawk 'has entered into a
financial documentation phase of its debt restructuring which it is hoped
will be concluded soon,' he said.
Speyhawk's liabilities now exceed its assets by about Pounds 160m. The
group's 46 banks, led by Barclays and Citibank, reached agreement in
principle on Christmas Eve for the restructuring, which involves the
subordination of debt.
Nearly half of the provisions were related to Speyhawk's City projects,
notably its scheme at Cannon Bridge. Last year, more than half the company's
provisions of Pounds 204.9m resulted from Cannon Bridge and Exchequer Court,
another City building.
Interest charges increased from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 22.7m, partly as a
result of provisions for interest charges on project loans.
Speyhawk said the basis of the business plan that underpinned the debt
restructuring proposals was 'to achieve lettings and sales of completed
developments and investment properties in a phased and orderly manner.'
Turnover fell from Pounds 76.4m to Pounds 69.7m.
Losses per share were 352.1p (829.7p). No dividend will be paid or should be
expected 'for the foreseeable future.'
The company's shares closed 4p down at 8p.

INGHAM, the worsted spinner, yesterday said it was proceeding with the
acquisition of Moss Europe and raising Pounds 3.64m through a 1-for-4 rights
issue of up to 4.04m new shares at 100p.
Moss, which supplies parts for British classic sports cars, is being bought
for Pounds 4.5m, satisfied by the issue of 3.4m shares and payment of Pounds
1.5m cash. It made Pounds 544,000 pre-tax on Pounds 13.6m turnover in 1992.
Net assets were Pounds 2.66m.
In addition, Ingham has entered into certain arrangements and contracts with
the vendors, Milard - the principal shareholder - Howard Goldman and Glen
Adams, which include the sale of the enlarged group's US business to Milard
in exchange for Milard convertible loan stock.
Ingham is paying a second interim dividend of 4.5p in respect of the 15
months to end-March and declared its intention to pay total dividends of not
less than 4.7p for the year to March 31 1994.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tough conditions in Europe hit Brammer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMMER, the ball bearing distributor and electrical services group, blamed
depressed business conditions throughout Europe for a 10 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
Profits declined from Pounds 9.16m to Pounds 8.23m on increased sales of
Pounds 122.6m (Pounds 111.5m).
Mr Robert Ffoulkes - Jones, chief executive, said: 'While economic activity
has got slightly better in the UK the recession is deepening in continental
Europe.'
The group is predicting another tough year. Mr Ffoulkes - Jones warned
against expectations of a significant UK recovery. 'We have seen false dawns
before,' he said.
Approximately 80 per cent of revenue is generated in the UK. The group is
planning to expand on the Continent.
The BSL distribution division reported a small fall in profits before
exceptional items from Pounds 7.95m to Pounds 7.88m.
However, the rental business suffered another big fall from Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 832,000.
Redundancy costs were responsible for an exceptional charge of Pounds
452,000 (Pounds 382,000).
Last year's acquisition of Roulement Service accounted for sales of Pounds
7.1m and an operating profit of Pounds 233,000.
Earnings per share fell to 13.4p (14.7p).
An unchanged final dividend of 8.5p makes a maintained total of 13p.
COMMENT
After its fourth consecutive year of declining profits Brammer has to
convince the market that it has a strategy for growth. The omens do not look
good. The rental business has been reporting a fall in profits ever since it
was acquired in 1985. A large part of that is due to the loss in defence
work. BSL continues to perform well, if not spectacularly. The decision to
acquire the French Roulement Service fits nicely into the group's strategy
of becoming a pan-European distributor of industrial products. But given the
worsening recession in continental Europe the timing is open to question.
With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m, giving earnings of 15p, the
shares are on on a prospective multiple of 17.5. It is difficult to see how
the premium to the market can be justified.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sketchley shares fall on trading warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKETCHLEY, the cleaning and textile rental company, yesterday said trading
conditions for its dry cleaning division deteriorated during the second half
of its financial year.
Previous market estimates for profits to the end of March, which had already
been downgraded, were still too high, the company said. The shares fell 14p
to 96p on the warning.
Mr Tony Bloom, who joined as deputy chairman in 1991 after Sketchley came
close to collapse after a period of rapid expansion, said dry cleaning sales
had been poor but the company was still operating at a profit.
'The high street has not turned round in a significant fashion,' he said.
Full year profits are expected to fall from Pounds 6m to about Pounds 4.5m.
The company is expected to maintain its final dividend.
Sketchley also announced it is paying Pounds 4.3m plus Pounds 2m goodwill
for Supasnaps, the film processing chain owned by Dixons. In addition ,
Sketchley will repay inter-group indebtedness estimated at Pounds 1.7m. The
chain operates from about 350 outlets, all of which are leased. It has about
8 per cent of the processing market, compared to market leader Boots with 23
per cent.
Sketchley plans to install new Supasnaps outlets in its dry cleaning outlets
as a way to boost revenues. This would also allow Supasnaps to expand
cheaply.
Supasnaps is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds 700,000 in
the year to April 30 from Pounds 45m turnover. The company has net assets of
about Pounds 2.3m. Mr Bloom said he expected the acquisition to contribute
to Sketchley profits from this year.
Sketchley was due to release preliminary results for the year to end-March
in mid-May. Because of the acquisition, the company will probably release a
profits estimate with its circular to shareholders on the Supasnaps deal,
expected in the next couple of weeks.

FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart falls to Pounds 12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, yesterday
sounded cautiously optimistic about recent signs of recovery following a 20
per cent fall in profits, but said it was too soon to say whether these
would be sustained.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said there had been an increase in demand in
late February and March from a broad spread of industry, though there was
little sign as yet of price recovery, and directors were more relaxed about
the short-term outlook than they were a few months ago.
The Glasgow-based group reported a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m
to Pounds 12m in the year to January 31. Sales were down from Pounds 171m to
Pounds 165m.
Sir Matthew said: 'These results must be considered extremely satisfactory,
having been achieved in the depths of the recession and covering, as they
do, the winter months which saw the failure of two of Britain's largest
contractors, Budge and Lilley, and other bankruptcies.'
The tower crane division incurred a loss of Pounds 923,000, compared with a
profit of Pounds 1.85m.
Sir Matthew said that after stripping out the tower crane figures, the
remainder of the group almost maintained profits at Pounds 13m (Pounds
13.2m) in an extremely difficult period.
The hire divisions virtually held profits at Pounds 12.26m (Pounds 12.53m)
in spite of a drop in sales from Pounds 112m to Pounds 108m, excluding
cranes.
Sir Matthew said the division met fierce competition on price, and on many
occasions deliberately sacrificed turnover in the face of pricing policies
by others which appeared solely dictated by the need to generate cash in the
short term.
'JCBs were being hired out, with a driver, for Pounds 10 an hour - you
couldn't get a plumber with his bag to fix your washing machine for that
sort price.'
Strong cashflow meant that the group increased net cash from Pounds 7m to
Pounds 13m, in spite of capital expenditure of Pounds 23m.
Earnings per share fell from 5.35p to 4.4p. A final dividend of 2.365p
(2.285p) makes a total for the year of 3.24p (3.15p).
COMMENT
These were excellent results from a company which continues to shine in an
otherwise grim sector. Having shrunk its tower crane fleet from a boom-time
peak of 180 to 60, the group is confident that they should now operate at
break-even this year and might even make some money. The group is bringing
forward capital expenditure and its tax rate should benefit from capital
allowances. Forecast profits of Pounds 14m put the shares - up   1/2 p at
104 1/2 p - on a prospective multiple of about 20. That is high, but the
group is operationally highly geared and will not hesitate to use its strong
cash position to expand when recovery comes through. Looking at cashflow and
longer-term prospects for earnings, it still looks a quality recovery play.

FT  08 APR 93 / Queens Moat loss estimated at up to Pounds 80m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT Houses made losses in 1992 of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 80m,
compared with expectations a fortnight ago that pre-tax profits of Pounds
80m would be reported. This preliminary loss estimate was reported yesterday
to a four-hour emergency meeting of the group's 62 banks.
Barclays, which was chairing the meeting, asked the 120 bankers present to
give formal agreement to a two-month freeze on interest and principal
payments on the international hotel group's Pounds 1bn debt.
A longer-term debt rescheduling proposal is expected to be put to banks in
six weeks, when an information package should have been produced by
accountants from Grant Thornton, who were appointed last week to review the
company's financial condition.
It also emerged yesterday that the Stock Exchange's insider trading group is
expected next week to pass to the Department of Trade and Industry the
results of a preliminary investigation into possible insider trading of
shares in Queens Moat Houses. An official said the DTI will then decide
whether to launch a formal investigation under Section 177 of the Financial
Services Act.
Meanwhile bankers were told that the company appears to be profitable at the
trading level. The two co-ordinating banks, Barclays and National
Westminster, said after the meeting that they believed Queens Moat had
'substantial assets and real value' and that the group had sufficient funds
to meet its trading needs in the short term.
A banker said he hoped Queens Moat might emerge with net assets of around
Pounds 1bn, compared with Pounds 1.3bn at the end of 1991.
He added that the best way to preserve the value of the company's assets was
for its bankers to keep their nerve and eventually agree to a financial
restructuring.
Bankers were told that considerable progress has been made in the search for
a caretaker chief executive. The company last week suspended its finance
director, Mr David Hersey, and its deputy chairman, Mr Martin Marcus.
The Exchange's share probe focused on the sale in early February of 1.1m
Queens Moat Shares by Mr Marcus for Pounds 627,000. He sold the shares
shortly before the start of the company's close season, when directors'
share sales are banned.

FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays closes book on unhappy chapter: How the bank hopes
to avoid the mistakes of the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE short, unhappy life of the Barclays Bank division that let property
lending get out of hand in the late 1980s is at least ending with a bang
rather than a whimper. The bank will tell its managers today that the
Central Advances Department is to disappear, along with the executive in
charge.
Mr Mark Deverell, whose misfortune was to be made director of risk
management of Barclays in 1989 amid what turned out to be a catastrophic
lending boom, is leaving the bank. His job has been abolished as Barclays
reforms the way it assesses loan risks, and balances its portfolio.
Mr Alan Brown, who takes the equivalent post in the new structure, does not
mince words about the failure of the CAD, founded in the early 1980s. He
says the lending following Barclays' Pounds 921m rights issue in 1988 was
too much for managers who had to approve loans and monitor the portfolio.
'We undoubtedly feel that we were too aggressive in that period. That means
you take on business at a speed which makes your executives so busy that
they cannot be as thorough as they could be before.'
He says the balance of loans was distorted towards property, construction
and hotels because the 500 managers and staff under Mr Deverell were
swamped: 'We had the classic business dilemma of choosing between things
that are important and things that are urgent. The balance was wrong.'
The effect can be seen by comparing Barclays' portfolio and provisions with
those of National Westminster, the second largest UK bank by assets. The
banks have lent in roughly the same proportions to most sectors, but
Barclays has more exposure to property and construction.
Barclays was always strong in property and construction. But the two sectors
proved far more risky than in the past. Together, they accounted for only
11.9 per cent of its loan book last year. But 38 per cent of its Pounds
1.96bn provision against UK lending in the UK related to them.
A second problem was over the approval and monitoring of individual loans.
Each loan of more than Pounds 5m was approved by at least one executive in
CAD, and monitored by the bank's risk management committee. This comprised
senior directors and executives which reviewed bad debts and exposures.
Mr Brown says that this committee - in spite of the emphasis placed on it in
Barclays' annual report - met infrequently. 'They did not meet on individual
loans unless there was a special reason. They passed the proposition around.
The first person signed, and then the second, and so on.'
So although Barclays in theory had a system of checks and balances to
monitor loans, in practice the CAD was too busy to balance the portfolio
well, and the risk committee hardly discussed individual loans. 'There was a
danger that because the first person said yes, so did the others,' he says.
Under Barclays' new structure - in place this month - there will be three
changes.
The first is that Mr Brown will head the new 'group credit policy unit'
which will monitor exposures and balancing the portfolio. Mr Brown says this
means there will be a smaller proportion of property lending, as well as
shifts in country exposure, and the re-pricing of loans in some other
lending areas.
'We have still got a big business here. We are not talking about dumping
whole categories of customers, but of lightening the load in certain areas,'
he says. He expects that over two years, the bank will be able to rebalance
its portfolio to match a new computer model of credit risk it is developing.
The model is expected to be applied to all but the smallest loans within a
year. It rates risk according to factors such as industry sector, company
size and history, and financial information. Barclays has drawn it up using
data on large loans dating back six years in the UK.
Mr Brown emphasises that he sees his task as rebalancing the portfolio
rather than growing Barclays' balance sheet. 'It is patently obvious from
our results that we could have lent the same amount of money, and if we had
lost less of it, we would have a better net result,' he says.
The second change is that the loan approval responsibility of the CAD will
be broken up. Instead, there will be separate risk management departments
within the banking and investment banking divisions. This is intended to
give a greater sense of responsibility for loans to those who make them.
All loans which would have had to be approved within the CAD previously will
be allocated to a single 'responsible executive' within the line divisions.
This executive - drawn from about 150 around the world - will have to follow
each loan through to the end.
'There should be less chance of a line person saying 'It is my job to
deliver as many propositions to you as possible, and the ones that go right
will get me a bonus, and the ones that go wrong are down to you',' says Mr
Brown. The third change is that the risk management committee is being
scrapped and a 'group credit committee' put in its place. This will be
chaired by Mr Humphrey Norrington, a vice-chairman of Barclays, and will
meet daily to discuss individual exposures of above Pounds 150m.
'They are similar directors from the ones who signed the very largest
credits before, but in order to get a more active discussion they will meet
if necessary every day for a short period,' says Mr Brown. He says the bank
wants to promote a debate about risks that was largely absent before.
Will this new scrutiny leave a bank that just looks like all the rest? Mr
Brown says it wants to remain distinctive, but its traditions will be under
scrutiny. 'Where we are different, we will want to have asked ourselves why
in a diligent, professional manner.'

FT  08 APR 93 / ICL profits halved by competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority
stake, saw profits before tax almost halved last year because of the price
competition and harsh market conditions afflicting almost every computer
manufacturer today.
Revenues, however, rose 32 per cent and the company generated net cash flow
from operations of Pounds 240m.
Profits before interest and tax were Pounds 60.6m, compared with Pounds
78.9m last year, a decline of 23 per cent. Profits before tax were Pounds
38.6m, compared with Pounds 62.4m last year, a down 38 per cent.
Revenues rose Pounds 2.48bn from Pounds 1.87bn last year. Mr Peter Bonfield,
ICL chairman and chief executive, said most of the growth was the result of
the consolidation of acquisitions including Nokia Data and Sorbus. Organic
growth was probably only 5 per cent.
The overall market, however, was either flat or in decline, implying the
company had performed well to show growth at all.
ICL spent Pounds 242m on research and development in 1992, 8.5 per cent more
than in 1991, chiefly in the development of new personal computer models
manufactured by the Nokia data subsidiary. It is now a significant player in
the European PC market.
Net debt at December 31 was Pounds 94.2m, equivalent to a gearing of 35 per
cent after capital expenditure, acquisitions, rationalisation costs and
financing charges.
ICL's results are of more than academic interest to the London market
because of Fujitsu's intention to float at least 25 per cent of the company
at a minimum price of 225p a share by 1995.
Plans for the flotation are still on track, Mr Bonfield said. Advisers and
merchant bankers had been appointed.
Mr Keith Todd, director of finance, said operating expenses had been driven
down from 25 per cent in 1991 to 23 per cent last year and further
improvement was expected in 1993.

FT  08 APR 93 / Watchdog seeks rule on stock options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US COMPANIES will have to disclose the value of options granted to
executives and deduct them from profits under an accounting rule change
proposed yesterday by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
However, FASB, a private sector group which sets standards for the
accounting industry, tried to placate institutional investors, who have
argued in favour of the changes, and companies who have opposed them, by
proposing a three-year interim measure. The full force of the proposal would
not take effect until 1997.
Stocks options can bloat an executive's salary. In 1992, Blockbuster
Entertainment's chief executive had Dollars 65.7m (Pounds 43m) in stock
option gains, the head of Toys 'R' Us received Dollars 30.5m from stock
options and Chrysler's Mr Lee Iacocca reaped profits of Dollars 5.8m in
stock options.
Under the plan, grants of stock options would be listed in a table in the
footnotes of financial statements for three years after the accounting
change is approved. Thereafter, stock options would be recognised as an
expense on the day the options are granted, but the expense would be spread
over the entire vesting period.
The stock would be valued using an options pricing model that would take
company growth and the stock's volatility into account.
FASB has been under pressure to change the rules governing stock options
since 1991, when Michigan senator Mr Carl Levin introduced a bill that would
require stock options to be valued and charged against earnings. Senator
Levin recently reintroduced the bill to force an accounting charge if a FASB
rule is not adopted soon.
While institutional shareholder groups have supported the proposed
accounting change, some corporations have opposed it. Treasury secretary Mr
Lloyd Bentsen wrote to FASB voicing his reservations about the proposal
'which would require companies to take a highly debatable charge to earnings
when granting stock options'.
Mr Bentsen has called for an alternative that would stress full disclosure
without changing accounting rules. The FASB proposal comes at a time of
increasingly tough rules governing disclosure of executive pay.

FT  08 APR 93 / Norwich may switch Pounds 20bn life fund from gilts to
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, the mutual insurance group, is considering switching part of
its Pounds 20bn life fund from gilts into equities, it announced yesterday.
This would be a reverse of the switch into bonds which NU made in autumn
1991, when the weighting of fixed interest in its life fund was increased
from zero to 16 per cent.
At the same time it made cuts of up to 9 per cent in the maturity payouts to
with-profits policyholders. It did this predicting that the annual return on
equities this decade would be 8 per cent, against 6 per cent for bonds. NU's
average inflation prediction for the decade was 3.5 per cent.
Continuing sales of property during 1992, combined with strong performance
by the gilts market, have raised NU's bond holding to 26 per cent, with 19
per cent in property and 55 per cent in equities.
Yesterday, Mr Philip Scott, general manager for finance, said the switch
into gilts had created an investment profit for the fund of Pounds 100m. But
he added: 'There's a feeling that returns from gilts are not going to be as
attractive in the next two years as they were in the last two years.'
Norwich Union plans to move back into equities later this year, although no
definite decisions have been made. Its inflation prediction for 1994 has
been altered to 4.5 per cent.
This switch would be made easier by the improvement in free assets which
Norwich Union also announced yesterday. NU's free asset ratio was only 6 per
cent at the end of 1991.
Under the Department of Trade and Industry's reserving requirements,
solvency can be improved by moving from equities into fixed interest, and by
cutting bonuses.
NU's free asset ratio is now 9 per cent, while its free reserves are Pounds
2.7bn, compared with Pounds 1.8bn in 1991 and Pounds 2.0bn in 1990.
The company was also helped by a return to profit in its general insurance
arm, which made Pounds 13m worldwide, following a Pounds 165m loss in 1991.
This allowed a transfer of Pounds 21.7m to the life fund.

<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK has added Pounds 200m to its capital base at an attractive
cost, by using an innovative structure which may be imitated by other banks,
writes Tracy Corrigan.
The structure of the undated, subordinated issue gives the bank the option
of extending the maturity of the debt indefinitely.
Unlike most perpetual debt, the upfront cost of the deal is only about half
a percentage point more than for dated, subordinated debt, for the first 15
years.
'If investors accept that this is the correct pricing, we could certainly
see more of these deals,' said one UK investment banker.

FT  08 APR 93 / Exchange probes Queens Moat shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange's insider trading group is expected next week to pass to
the Department of Trade and Industry the results of a preliminary
investigation into possible insider trading of shares in Queens Moat Houses,
an official disclosed yesterday.
The DTI will then decide whether to launch a formal investigation under
Section 177 of the Financial Services Act. This could involve the
appointment of a lawyer and accountant as inspectors, because Queens Moat's
financial problems partly stem from its accounting policies.
News of the Exchange's probe emerged as the international hotel group's
bankers held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to receive details of
Queens Moat's financial condition. Its shares were suspended last week when
the company discovered that 1992 pre-tax profits were going to be
significantly lower than the Pounds 80m it expected.
Queens Moat's 60 banks were told the group would make a loss for the year,
but that the group still has a sizeable net asset value. These are the
preliminary conclusions of an investigation of Queens Moat's finances by
accountants from Grant Thornton, appointed by the banks to conduct a review.
They were also told that a financial restructuring, involving rescheduling
principal payments on the Pounds 1bn bank debt, will be necessary, once
Grant Thornton's investigation is completed.
Bankers have been told that the company has made considerable progress in
finding a new caretaker chief executive. The company last week suspended its
finance director, Mr David Hersey, and its deputy chairman, Mr Martin
Marcus.
The Exchange's share probe focused on the sale in early February of 1.1m
Queens Moat Shares by Mr Marcus for Pounds 627,000. He sold the shares
shortly before the start of the company's close season, when directors'
share sales are banned. The company's merchant bank adviser, Charterhouse,
and its two lead bank creditors, National Westminster and Barclays, are
trying to persuade the other banks not to call for the resignation of the
company's founder and chairman Mr John Bairstow. Bankers said that it was Mr
Bairstow who originally identified that the group's profits had been
inflated by some of its accounting policies.

The chancellor should not quake in his boots to find Norwich Union thinking
of switching from gilts into equities. Investment fundamentals aside, the
move into bonds 18 months ago was not unrelated to the declining free asset
ratio of Norwich Union's main life assurance fund. Since the strength of the
fund has improved it is only natural for investment strategy to adapt. There
are plenty more life and pension funds with good reasons of their own for
favouring gilts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nurdin &amp; Peacock's 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits represented
a better performance than the market expected. But the company's bold
departure this year in investing Pounds 20m in opening two US-style
warehouse clubs either suggests a high degree of fear about the future of
its cash-and-carry business or unaccustomed aggression about opportunities
in retailing.
Although well-trailed, N&amp;P's move is likely to be seen as a further blow to
sentiment in the ravaged food retailing sector. Warehouse clubs, selling a
narrow range of heavily discounted goods, will not quickly win huge slices
of market share. Mainstream retailers will not worry greatly about N&amp;P given
its unproven retailing skills - although the arrival of Costco of the US is
a more serious proposition. The broader worry is that the warehouses will
lead to greater consumer fixation with price, lowering the margin structure
throughout the industry.

FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: ICL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few investors would experience paroxysms of excitement at the prospect of
investing in a company which generates just Pounds 26m of distributable
profits on sales of Pounds 2.5bn. Throw in fast-changing markets, weighty
capital spending needs and ferocious competition and it all adds up to a
seemingly unpalatable brew. Yet some time before the end of 1995, ICL, the
UK's flagship computer company in which Fujitsu holds an 80 per cent stake,
is committed to a partial flotation. It would be wise to be patient.
Yesterday's results certainly showed ICL to be performing more resiliently
than most dared hope. To record any profit in today's unforgiving computer
markets ranks as a considerable achievement. ICL has proved nimbler than
most in moving away from mainframe markets into more profitable services and
mid-range systems. It has also demonstrated stringent management controls,
mitigating a 6 percentage point fall in gross margins by cutting its
operating expenses to revenue ratio by 2 points.
Yet there are few signs of any market upswing; indeed trading conditions may
deteriorate further this year. This makes the timing of any flotation tricky
given the momentum of expectation building both within and outside the
company. It would be a shame if ICL felt compelled to fatten itself up for
the market and let short-term considerations impinge on its development. Its
alliance with Fujitsu has created the confidence to increase research and
development expenditure and make acquisitions throughout the recession. That
will bring its own rewards.

FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Comforting though it is that Queens Moat Houses still has positive net
worth, that addresses only part of the concern. The company also faces the
task of generating enough cash to service debts which must easily exceed
Pounds 1bn. Hotels traditionally generate little cash, which perhaps
explains why many chains are part of diversified groups and why Queens Moat,
as a pure hotel business, had recurrent need for outside funds. Its cash
problem is now compounded by the downturn in Germany and by self-inflicted
damage from its manager incentive scheme. One solution would be a programme
of disposals. That would worry other operators because of its impact on the
already depressed values of UK provincial hotels. Nor would it necessarily
help Queens Moat. The easiest hotels to sell would be those generating most
cash. Without them, its liquidity problem could worsen.
An elegant alternative would be for Forte to satisfy its diversification
ambitions by buying Queens Moat's European portfolio. The best of these
hotels operate under the competing Holiday Inn franchise, though, and Forte
may use the the Queens Moat crisis as cover to cut its own - uncovered -
dividend next week. Rebasing the payout could open the way to an eventual
rights issue. But funds would mostly be needed to repay debt leaving room
for little more than a nibble at Queens Moat. Bank lenders may end up
effectively running the company for some time. Since they will be squeezing
out what cash they can, competitors can expect some pretty aggressive
pricing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even those excluded from the global syndicate formed to market the third
tranche of the BT privatisation must admit that the structure is a sign of
the times. In a global equity market it makes sense for large international
issues to be marketed globally by investment banks with worldwide reach. In
the last BT sale, cross-border marketing was permitted only to SG Warburg.
This time the restriction has been relaxed. The hope is the sale will
proceed more smoothly as a result.
Still, the UK Treasury is taking some risks. The structure also gives 11
banks exclusive rights to market the paper to the 500 top institutions
worldwide who would anyway be expected to take up the lion's share of the
issue. It is to be hoped that in return for this privilege members of this
group will compete effectively against each other. Otherwise the arrangement
will go down simply as providing jobs for the boys. This risk is higher if
the selection process was distorted for political reasons, for example in
the vain hope of reciprocity in other countries' privatisation deals.
One test will be whether overseas buyers take up more than the 40 per cent
share of the institutional tranche they absorbed last time round. The
talents of BZW and NatWest Securities would then have been put to good use.
The risk is that the opposite happens and that the likes of Daiwa and
Paribas discover hitherto undreamed of skills in selling to UK institutions.
Having been given the opportunity, they will presumably try their best.

FT  08 APR 93 / Oil explorers warn of tax threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil operators are preparing to warn the government that they will
scale down oil exploration severely if changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax
proposed in the Budget become law.
The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted
a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies
will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over
future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes.
A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that
85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT
changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much
higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000.
The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing
oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The
chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal
work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent
on drilling activity, compared with 17p now.
Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the
North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those
applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of
wells.
If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable
to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the
new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the
changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but
British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from
existing fields.
Last year 116 wells were drilled and some estimates expect this to drop to
just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT
changes.

FT  08 APR 93 / Hopes rise over Leyland DAF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES for the future of nearly 1,000 jobs at the Leyland DAF van plant in
Birmingham were boosted last night by an agreement in principle for a
management buy-out.
The optimism was bolstered by a possible breakthrough in a components
dispute which has threatened to halt production at the van plant and the
truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, which employs 1,100 people.
The two developments raised hopes of continued employment at the truck
plant, where a buy-out is also planned, and for the company's 1,400 other
workers.
Funding for the Birmingham buy-out is being led by 3i, the UK's largest
venture capital group. Last night, however, both its other backers and the
total amount involved remained unknown.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the joint administrative receivers, said he was
satisfied the required funding was in place for a buy-out by the plant's
managers, led by managing director Mr Allan Amey.
The announcement coincided with talks over the halting of key brake and
clutch component supplies by Automotive Products, a BBA group subsidiary. A
solution to the dispute is important for both the buy-outs.
AP requested a meeting with the receivers last night, in what it hinted was
an attempt to find a way of resuming supplies to both Leyland DAF plants,
while pursuing its claim for Pounds 750,000 in respect of components
delivered before the receivership.
The talks, which ended apparently inconclusively, with a joint statement
that both sides were 'considering their positions', took place just 24 hours
after the Court of Appeal had upheld a High Court ruling last week that AP
was under no obligation to resume parts supplies.
The receivers had argued unsuccessfully that AP's refusal to continue
supplies breached EC law by abusing the company's dominant market position.
However, the circumstances of last night's meeting suggest that AP is
actively seeking a solution which would allow both plants to stay in
business. It has already begun separate talks with the Birmingham MBO
principals concerning possible supplies when the managers take over.
Mr McKillop said last night there were 'good grounds' for hoping the
Birmingham MBO would be completed by April 19. So far AP is believed not to
have begun talks with the management team seeking to buy out the Leyland
trucks operations. This MBO is understood to be at a considerably less
advanced stage than the Birmingham venture.
Meanwhile, the receivers indicated yesterday that, if no agreement with AP
could be reached, alternative suppliers might be found far more quickly than
had been considered possible.

FT  08 APR 93 / Danger of Stalin's secret N-plants: Leyla Boulton recently
visited the site of Tuesday's nuclear leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRON GATES, rows of barbed wire, searchlights and armed guards separate
Tomsk-7, Stalin's secret nuclear city in western Siberia, from the outside
world.
This is the site of a radioactive explosion on Tuesday night which has
heightened fears about the once-pampered defence plants of the former Soviet
Union which are still involved in the production of nuclear weapons.
The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna yesterday put the Tomsk
accident at Level Three on the International Nuclear Events Scale. That
means 'a serious incident with on-site contamination but no effects
off-site'. Chernobyl was a Level Seven disaster.
However, a radioactive cloud was last night reported to be moving across
Siberia away from Tomsk-7 and the nearby city of Tomsk. Russian television
said the cloud was moving northeast at a height of 1.2 miles and a speed of
22 mph. The environmental group Greenpeace said several villages were at
risk from wind-borne fallout. Russian officials in Tomsk tested snow for
radiation.
International environmental groups have blamed lax safety standards at the
plant and said the international community should press Russia to stop
plutonium production immediately. Anti-nuclear activists urged US president
Bill Clinton to make his Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) aid package, offered
at last weekend's Vancouver summit, contingent upon Russia halting
production of civilian and military plutonium.
However, Mr John Gittus, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry
Forum, which monitors nuclear incidents around the world, said the incident
was nowhere near as bad as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. 'There can be no
comparison between this incident and what happened at Chernobyl seven years
ago,' he said.
On a recent visit there the Financial Times was allowed to see only the prim
administrative and residential centre, with solid, pastel-colour Stalin-era
houses, amid beautiful Siberian forest.
But Professor Alexei Yablokov, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ecology
and health, said his wife, a journalist, had seen 'rusting locks and leaking
roofs' at nuclear-related facilities there.
The incident at the Tomsk-7 chemical plant was the first at the heart of
Russia's secretive defence industry to be openly and promptly acknowledged.
Tomsk-7, established by Stalin to develop a nuclear bomb, is today a town of
110,000 people, producing plutonium and enriched uranium for nuclear
weapons.
Mr Gennady Khandorin, director of the chemical plant, said the reasons for a
build-up of pressure which destroyed a container of radioactive material
were still unknown. He said his staff were fine and only a stretch of road
outside the plant had suffered from 'very small, local contamination'.
The incident was nonetheless the worst in the former Soviet Union since
Chernobyl.
Special permission is required for a visit to Tomsk-7's two reactors, which
produce nuclear fuel from which uranium and plutonium are derived, plus the
chemical works where components for nuclear weapons are developed.,
Moscow is proposing to make Tomsk-7 the site of a national repository for
plutonium from nuclear weapons dismantled under arms reduction treaties, and
the US Congress has pledged Dollars 400m to fund such a facility. The
incident is likely to put this plan into question.
Despite Tomsk-7's desire to open up to the outside world - not least because
of a reduction in special state support which used to make its isolation
profitable - it is the victim of difficulties in transforming Russia's
military-industrial machine.
Mr Nicolai Yegorov, deputy atomic energy minister, said last month that
Tomsk-7 had to continue to produce fresh plutonium until it had a centre in
which to recycle the ageing plutonium which needs to be replaced
periodically in nuclear weapons not covered by arms treaties.

FT  08 APR 93 / PM moves to restart Ulster talks: Government to draw up
proposals for devolved assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to draw up proposals for a devolved government in Northern
Ireland in an attempt to restart political talks in the province, Mr John
Major announced yesterday.
Increasing the pressure on Unionist and nationalist politicians to resume
negotiations, the prime minister said: 'There is an opportunity to catch the
mood, to achieve a political accommodation.' He would be proposing an 'early
start' to new talks.
Fresh reminders of the continuing terrorist threat came when a bomb exploded
outside a Conservative club in London, causing disruption to rush-hour
traffic at nearby Euston and St Pancras stations, but injuring no one.
Earlier, three soldiers were wounded in an IRA mortar attack in Northern
Ireland.
Mr Major returned from Ulster yesterday evening to join Mrs Mary Robinson,
Irish president, in attending a memorial service for the two victims of an
IRA bomb attack on Warrington last month. US President Bill Clinton sent a
strongly worded message condemning those who 'support and perpetuate'
violence - suggesting he is determined not to give succour to IRA supporters
in the US.
Last night also saw the meeting in Ulster of IRA representatives with Irish
Senator Gordon Wilson whose daughter was killed in the 1987 Enniskillen
remembrance day massacre. After a meeting described as 'friendly and
forthright', the IRA issued a statement saying 'peace will only come about'
by recognising the 'proven failure of partition' and accepting the
'fundamental right of the Irish people to self determination'.
The Northern Ireland Office yesterday appeared undecided about what the
government's proposals for Ulster would involve. The government's move,
however, will end ministers' past role as 'neutral' arbiters between local
politicians and the Irish government.
Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he would like to devolve wide-ranging powers to
a new Northern Ireland administration - 'at least' to the same degree as the
Stormont government that was suspended in 1972. Sir Patrick could also
propose new mechanisms to involve the Irish republic in Northern Ireland and
protect the nationalist minority.
The main Northern Ireland parties appeared content yesterday to resume talks
after the province's local elections in May - although they may be low key
initially.
However, the Unionist and nationalist traditions appear as far apart as ever
on a political settlement. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
party, said he wanted firmer assurances that the Irish government was
prepared to negotiate away its constitutional claim on the north before he
entered talks.

</HEADLINE>

NORTH SEA oil operators are preparing to warn the government that they will
scale down oil exploration severely if changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax
proposed in the Budget become law.
The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted
a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies
will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over
future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes.
A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that
85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT
changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much
higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000.
The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing
oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The
chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal
work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent
on drilling activity, compared with 17p now.
Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the
North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those
applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of
wells.
If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable
to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the
new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the
changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but
British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from
existing fields.
Many companies want some transitional relief - the chancellor has said that
if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells, they can
still apply for tax relief. Companies want that to be extended to firm
commitments for drilling wells.
Analysts reckon that as part of previous licensing arrangements, the
industry is commited to drilling 170 wells over the next couple of years.
Last year 116 wells were drilled in the North Sea, and some estimates expect
this to drop off to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price
and the PRT changes. An average of one in seven wells strikes oil.

FT  08 APR 93 / BMW to assemble cars in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

BMW, the German luxury carmaker, plans to assemble cars in Vietnam from next
year in a venture signalling the rapid pace of the country's economic
change.
The company has signed an agreement to set up a sales, parts and service
network in Vietnam, and intends to assemble up to 200 cars a year.
Although the initial number of units is modest, Mr Bernd Wiegand, managing
director for BMW Asia, said the decision was 'strategic' and reflected the
company's confidence in the development of Vietnam and the availability of
qualified labour.
Manufacturing will be confined to the 316i and the 520i models, to be built
from from assembly kits shipped from Germany. Some parts will be
manufactured locally.
The venture is important in Vietnam's quest for foreign investment, backed
by radical economic reforms as the country moves away from central planning
and state control, but hampered by a US embargo, dating back to the Vietnam
war, on doing business with the communist country and by poor infrastructure
due to lack of funds.
Many foreign manufacturers, however, are attracted by a cheap and
enthusiastic labour force and by the opportunities Vietnam will present when
the US ban is fully lifted and funding from international financial
institutions begins to flow.
The motor industry in Vietnam is in its infancy, and the road network is
badly in need of upgrading and repair, but many Vietnamese have substantial
savings in cash which could be used to buy vehicles as the economy grows and
the infrastructure improves.
The agreement is with Vietnam Motors Corporation, a Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m)
joint venture 70 per cent owned by Columbian Motors of the Philippines -
which assembles Japanese and South Korean cars in the Philippines - and 30
per cent by Hoa Binh, a state-owned bus manufacturer based in Hanoi,
northern Vietnam.
BMW has similar assembly agreements in Thailand, Uruguay, Malaysia and
Indonesia, but it exports its cars directly to 115 other countries.

FT  08 APR 93 / Caught out by a turning tide: David Marsh argues that Europe
faces a radical reshaping of priorities

'To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.'
 - Sir Isaac Newton
In 1989-90, a triumphant wave of western liberal capitalism crashed onto the
beachhead of central and eastern Europe, washing away communism's rusty
hold. Three years later, the western part of the continent is caught in the
backwash of its own previous success. Europe has served up a large-scale
laboratory demonstration of Newton's third law of motion.
In the east, fragmentation is on the march, illustrated by the war in former
Yugoslavia, the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and, less
catastrophically, by the break-up of Czechoslovakia. In western Europe,
fissiparous forces are at work, too, seen in regional factionalism in Italy
and Belgium, or the new economic and social cleavages in unified Germany.
Yet what has crumbled most is political vision and leadership, sapped by
economic downturn, unemployment and electoral disenchantment. The fall of
the Berlin wall, the unification of Germany and the unravelling of the
Soviet empire were cathartic events for which the west was immensely
grateful, and immensely unprepared. Western Europe reacted by trying to
speed up, through the Maastricht treaty, moves towards EC unity first
launched in the 1950s and accelerated by the process of creating a single
European market. That was always a debatable choice. In retrospect, it looks
like the wrong one.
West European politicians gave priority to deepening integration rather than
spreading it eastwards. They failed to realise that the collapse of
communism would create a corresponding crisis of adjustment in the west.
They did not recognise that the pain accompanying the necessary overhaul of
west European structures would diminish ordinary people's enthusiasm for
political and economic union.
They foresaw neither the scale of economic problems resulting from German
unification, nor the extent to which these would reverberate across Europe.
They did not anticipate that the Maastricht plan to replace the D-Mark with
a European currency would become an obstacle rather than a catalyst for the
reconstruction of Europe.
This was a catalogue of miscalculation. Now, in drawing up the
post-Maastricht agenda, west European governments face three interlinked
challenges. The most important is to build a stronger economic bridge
integrating the eastern and western parts of the Continent. Unless
governments master this first task, they are likely to fail in the other two
aims: restoring their authority and esteem in the eyes of voters, and
succeeding in Europe's economic struggle to keep up with other parts of the
industrialised world.
Three years ago, all the goals seemed within reach. In dozens of statesmanly
speeches, the talk was of partnership and prosperity, resolution and reward.
German and European unity, according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were 'two
sides of the same coin'. The coin has since tarnished; the rhetoric has
turned sour.
'What's the situation in Europe today? Uncertainty, uncertainty,
uncertainty. That's a disaster,' says Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the new
Danish prime minister. As current chairman of the EC Council, he believes
that Maastricht must be ratified. But, above all, he wants the EC to escape
from economic stagnation.
A senior official in the Bonn Chancellery talks of 'an accumulation of
uncertainties' posed by concerns about immigration and inflation, and by the
perception of impotence over the war in Bosnia. He compares Germany to a
confused football team. 'We have to keep on playing while the rules of the
game are being changed.'
East and west at least now recognise their interdependence. Across western
Europe - not simply in Germany, the only country which has been physically
transformed - the upheavals in the east have changed the mood of nations.
Would the withering of British self-confidence during the past few years
have been quite so severe had the post-Thatcher recession not coincided with
the end of the UK's cold war role as a guardian of a divided Europe? In
Italy, the eastern earthquakes have contributed to the splintering of the
old state and party structures which held the country for so long in the
grip of corruption.
In France, the diminishing of President Francois Mitterrand's public
standing was hastened by his futile attempts at the end of 1989 to hold up
German unification, and his underestimation, at the time of the hardliners'
coup in August 1991, of the forces of reform in the Soviet Union. And in
Spain, the fortunes of Mr Felipe Gonzalez are waning partly because, as new
eastern horizons open, the country is facing much greater competition in
seeking to attract foreign investors and EC subsidies.
Through these setbacks to European hopes runs a common economic thread. High
Bundesbank interest rates aimed at restraining the inflationary pressures of
German unification have been a principal cause of the European recession. It
could be as deep as the one in 1975 (the last year EC economies contracted),
and still more damaging.
The Maastricht treaty precepts for economic and monetary union (Emu),
designed to lay down a path for economic convergence and budgetary
rectitude, have so far produced neither. The treaty set targets for fiscal
deficits and indebtedness as conditions to determine which EC countries
could participate in Emu later in the decade. However, as a result of
recession-induced increases in social outlays and cuts in tax receipts,
average EC deficits this year will amount to between 5 and 7 per cent of
gross domestic product, well above the 3 per cent target.
Although the Maastricht targets are not meant to be reached until 1996 or
1998, a number of countries (including Germany) are likely to continue
diverging from them during the next few years. As a result, a treaty
ostensibly mapping the route to Emu now appears to contain built-in
road-blocks.
One continental European central bank governor, a long-time student of the
Bundesbank's scepticism about Emu, says: 'I could imagine that the Germans
said they (the targets) were necessary because they were impossible to
fulfil.'
West Europe's economic difficulties would be bad enough if they were merely
cyclical. But the EC's falling competitiveness shows they also embody an
important structural element.
Many EC countries, led by Germany, have for several years been registering
falling shares of international export markets for manufactured goods. The
trend is linked to Europe's high labour costs and technological shortcomings
compared not only with the US and Japan, but also with the emergent
capitalist economies of south-east Asia. The EC ran a trade deficit of
Dollars 90bn with the rest of the world last year - roughly three times its
1985-90 average. High production costs partly reflect the burdens of running
generous welfare systems which - for both economic and demographic reasons -
are becoming impossible to maintain.
Reflecting on such structural problems, Mr Alfred Grosser, one of France's
leading political scientists, says the European recession is not just 'a
temporary crisis'. Rather, it raises questions 'over the way we organise our
industrial society'.
Mr Grosser, a specialist on the Franco-German relationship, says basic links
between the governing classes in Paris and Bonn are in good order. He adds,
however: 'That's of little significance.' Commenting that unemployment and
economic uncertainty have created a gulf between governments and ordinary
citizens, Mr Grosser says, perhaps overdramatically, 'The two countries are
in the process of falling apart.'
Whatever the effects of recession, Franco-German ties will remain of utmost
importance for Europe's future. One emotion at the heart of the relationship
is, however, French mistrust of Germany - still not allayed after nearly
five decades of post-war co-operation.
According to a survey after last September's French referendum on
Maastricht, 21 per cent of France's Yes voters, and 40 per cent of No
voters, said that fear of Germany's domination of Europe had determined
their voting stance. The chairman of one of France's largest banks says
France still has a three or four-year 'window of opportunity' in which
post-unity Germany will be 'vulnerable.' During this time, France will be
able to negotiate with Bonn; afterwards, Germany will be too powerful.
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruc tion and
Development (EBRD), has occupied a key vantage point in Paris-Bonn
relations, and now has a central role on another part of the European stage.
As President Mitterrand's foreign policy adviser during the 1980s, Mr Attali
was one of Maastricht's architects. Now, however, Mr Attali calls it 'the
last treaty of the cold war'. The agenda has moved on.
Mr Attali concedes that the main objective of Maastricht is to 'get rid of
the D-Mark'. He stresses the importance of finalising the treaty: 'I'll
accept the word 'outdated' after it's ratified'. But he adds that once the
treaty, as he hopes, passes its hurdles in Denmark and the UK, 'the EC will
have to think of something else'.
This could be, Mr Attali suggests, the establishment of a pan-European
common market in order to lock the economies of eastern and central Europe
to the west. These countries should also participate, he proposes, in formal
political collaboration with the EC, ideally, through immediate full
membership.
In common with Mr Attali, Professor Alan Winters, an international trade
expert at Birmingham University, complains about EC protectionism in its
trade agreements finalised over the last year or so with former Soviet bloc
countries.
Prof Winters says: 'Noble concern for the welfare of our brothers in eastern
Europe has been subverted by entrenched economic interests.' He fiercely
criticises EC import restrictions in sectors such as steel, agriculture and
textiles.
Countries in eastern and central Europe have made impressive strides in
switching trade towards the west. But the run-down of traditional industries
has been much greater than expected.
Allowing for anticipated modest recovery in 1993, the combined real GDP of
Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics at the end of this year
will be roughly 20 per cent below that in 1988. Even after zero or maybe
negative growth in the EC this year, the Community's GDP at the end of 1993
will, by contrast, be 8 to 9 per cent above the 1988 figure.
Mr Jacek Siwicki, investment manager in the Warsaw-based Polish-American
Enterprise Fund, dealing with privatisation and acquisitions in Poland, was
in 1991 secretary of state in his country's privatisation ministry. He says
errors were made in forecasting the process of east European transition.
'We did not realise this is not like a turnround of a corporation. It is
like a situation after a war - after the atomic bomb has gone off. Millions
of people are hurt and injured.' Bringing about economic regeneration, he
says, 'has to be a managed process. You need a surgeon on the battlefield.
You cannot leave it all to the markets.'
To help organise structural change, Mr Roberto Leonardi, an expert in
government relations at the London School of Economics, calls for creation
of pan-European organisations similar to the European Coal and Steel
Community of the 1950s. Such ideas can find favour with industrialists. The
EBRD has established informal links with Eurofer, the European steel
producers' federation, to discuss steel overcapacity in east and west.
One board member of Mannesmann, the German engineering group, says everyone
would benefit from an orderly sharing out of work between steel companies in
the east and west. In view of high German production costs, 'The quicker we
transfer production eastwards, the less overall jobs (in Germany) we will
lose. We will gain new competitiveness, new markets and new volume.'
If co-operative arrangements such as this come to the fore, they will
reflect a redrawing of European priorities. The links between action and
reaction in east and west are now clear. Finding creative and mutually
beneficial ways of responding to them is likely to dominate Europe's
post-Maastricht agenda.

Being upstaged, as opposed to let down, by London Transport is a rare
experience. But Observer suffered it yesterday at the hands of Camden
Underground station, and in an unexpected context: Classical scholarship.
As a public rebuff to the mock-Latin bandied about in this column recently,
the station treated early commuters to the genuine article. In the wake of
repeated security alerts, the electronic indicator announced 'Welcome]
Normal service today]', then added a quotation attributed to the poet
Horace:
Quamquam festinas - hora no est longa] (Although you're in haste, the delay
is not long).
To which the obvious reply is: Quid ais? (Is it possible?)

How many bona fide two-letter words are there in English? Anyone knowing the
answer off pat will probably be an addict of Scrabble (in which short words
can be decisive in end-play) and so have cause to lament the death of the
game's US inventor Alfred Butts.
As old as the century and an architect by training, he devised the
word-based board game in the 1930s only to have it turned down by
manufacturers in the field. It was not until the early 1950s that the Macy's
retail chain began selling Scrabble, paving the way for an estimated total
sale in various languages which still seems low at 100m. He said he earned
only a few cents on each.
As for the two-letter words, according to Chambers English Dictionary, the
number is 106. The three-letter variety are far more plentiful, with 1,087.

Every Brit in business knows that the interpretation of some obscure point
of UK taxation law can represent the difference between profit and loss, at
least for smallish companies.
But which professional body is best fitted to watch over the training of
future tax experts to advise on the interpreting?
To date, the top qualifying body has been the Institute of Taxation, whose
members, including lawyers as well as accountants, have been generally
regarded as the ultimate gurus on the subject. Now, however, it faces a
challenge from within the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales whose tax faculty is proposing to set up its own examinations.
The move seems to be taxing tempers.
The faculty's chairman Peter Wyman has complained that institute members
have been organising opposition in an attempt to nobble the faculty's exam
plans. Besides denying said charge, the institute's president Jennifer
Ainsworth has riposted that the duplication 'would be divisive, would
increase costs, and would cause training difficulties for major employers'.
Whichever side may be right, it is gratifying to see the professional
experts emitting the sort of heat more usually displayed by those whose role
in taxation is merely to pay it.

The habits of a boring old utility have been clearly left behind by the
biggest of the UK's hived-off electricity generators, National Power. After
a mere couple of years in the private sector, it is switching its advisers
on and off with unseemly speed.
Out goes Lazard Brothers as principal financial adviser and in comes J Henry
Schroder Wagg, while County NatWest has been dumped as joint broker and
replaced by Smith New Court. However, even National Power didn't feel brave
enough to turn off Cazenove, its other joint broker.
Presumably the privatised generator is lining up ambitious corporate plans.
Schroder's knows more about regulation than most, and Smith New Court has
the number one research analyst in the sector. But will Smith ever again
issue a sell note on its biggest blue chip client?

FT  08 APR 93 / Observer: Comeback in bear market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stuffed koala bear makers, currently producing Australia's leading tourist
goods, are in danger of being overtaken by a backward industry, thanks to
aerospace engineer Conrad Stacey.
The Brisbane boffin has used his computer to sharpen the design of
boomerangs, which have hitherto lagged behind the bear market as a tourist
attraction. The reason is that most of those in the shops won't come back
when you throw them. About 85 per cent of them are 'rubbish', the country's
Boomerang Association says.
Stacey is promising a virtual return-on-sale guarantee for his version,
measuring 16in long with a 90 degree bend in the middle, and called the
Hooper after the type of pinewood from which it is made. 'Even a beginner
will get it returning after about 10 minutes' practice,' he claims.
Besides selling to visitors, his improvement may start a comeback in the
boomerang's popularity with native Australians. Although it was first used
by their aboriginal precursors millennia ago, they have since let their
throwing skills slip.
The one throwers' club in the country is outnumbered a hundredfold by clubs
in America. No Australian has ever won the boomerang world championships,
which are to be held next in Japan in 1994. And the world record for
long-distance throwing of a round 489 feet is held by a Frenchman, Michel
Dufayard.

FT  08 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE YEAR has passed since Mr John Major famously won the general election of
April 9th 1992. It has not been a happy twelve months. The prime minister
has lost authority. The Conservatives have split over the Maastricht treaty.
Britain has endured a demoralising winter. Now, however, economic recovery
is on the way and the Maastricht treaty may soon be ratified. The government
has an opportunity to set its own agenda, rather than be driven by events.
The prime minister has not been an innocent spectator. Over Europe, he has
played a dreadful hand as well as might be expected. This is hardly true
over the economy. Mr Major was chancellor of the exchequer when sterling was
put into the ERM. His record as prime minister includes misjudgement of the
recession; a huge deterioration of the public finances; vainglory about
sterling's strength before September 16; the government's row with the
Bundesbank over sterling's exit from the ERM; the subsequent failure to
change the economic team; and a refusal to draw radical lessons from the
debacle.
On polling day last year the Financial Times ruminated about the 'dangers of
perpetuating in power a weakened and uncertain Conservative party', a party
whose manifesto, we said, was 'a job lot of ideas with little sense of drive
or direction'. A year later the government's programme is as fragmented as
ever. However, our view last April that the risks of a change to Labour was
justified 'by a fine margin' has hardly been vindicated by that party's
performance in opposition. No wonder the country feels gloomy.
Lost authority
In the next year, the two great areas of responsibility facing Mr Major are,
as ever, Europe and the economy. On the first, his hope is to reunite his
party around an agenda that promotes both enlargement of the community and
decentralisation of its management. Other EC member states may be
sufficiently chastened to pay him more attention than they did a year or two
ago.
On the economy, what is needed for sustained recovery is to use the gain in
competitiveness from devaluation as a platform for long-term export-led
growth.
The most important precondition will be continued wage constraint. The
government needs to articulate a long-term view of wages that goes well
beyond the rough justice of its ceiling on public sector pay. It should, for
example, announce a direct link between changes in interest rates and trends
in wage settlements.
Mr Major will also need to give strong support to Michael Portillo's radical
review of public spending, which is an essential component of his effort to
bring the public finances under control. He may well have to consider
further tax increases as well. Any deflationary effects can and, if
necessary, should be offset by lower short-term rates of interest.
Bolder instincts
An even more fundamental point is that throughout the UK political system,
power is too centralised. This is bad in itself, but worse when it is also
poorly exercised. The power of the Treasury is no longer commensurate with
its reputation; the case for an independent Bank of England needs to be
answered; and more open discussion of major policy options is needed.
Advisory panels at the Treasury and on energy policy are a small step in the
right direction, but British government still works on the assumption that
the man in Whitehall knows best. It is no less important to think through
the consequences for accountability and transparency as quangoes take over
more governmental functions, particularly at the local level.
On questions of governance, Mr Major has a taste for radical language - for
example, proclaiming himself an apostle of open government, but his
instincts are conservative; he needs to be bolder. In some other policy
areas, education and training is the obvious example, he has inherited an
avalanche of change, which needs to be more coherently presented and more
effectively delivered.
It is unrealistic perhaps to call for a fresh 'vision', but the UK does need
a government with policies designed to last for years rather than months. In
spite of his small majority, that is the least the prime minister must
achieve.

FT  08 APR 93 / Leading Article: Anglo-German capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dominance of the banks in the capital markets of continental Europe has
always militated against the adoption of Anglo-Saxon financial habits such
as hostile takeovers and high pay-out ratios. Yet the resistance is finally
eroding in Europe's pre-eminent bank-based system, Germany. The decision by
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, to adopt US accounting and
disclosure requirements to obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange
is symptomatic. As the capital markets become global, the Anglo-Saxon model
is tending, for better or worse, to prevail.
Well-known German companies such as Hoesch in steel and Feldmuhle in
packaging have recently fallen victim to predators. Shareholder activism,
meantime, has been breaking out at the annual general meetings of corporate
giants like Siemens and Daimler. Interestingly, Daimler recently decided to
unwind a defensive arrangement whereby 25 per cent of its capital was held
in a special holding company. Nor is it just domestic shareholders who have
been complaining about restrictive voting arrangements. A representative of
the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) shook the
management of the conglomerate RWE last year by denouncing the company's
restricted voting rights at the annual general meeting.
Shareholder activism
The influence of big pension funds like Calpers is not to be
under-estimated. Around 40 per cent of the tradeable shares of German
companies is now in foreign hands. German management could afford to ignore
foreign owners in the 1980s when companies were cash-rich. But with the
domestic economy contracting and profits under severe pressure, access to
international capital suddenly becomes important, especially in a system
with few funded pension schemes, where private investors prefer bonds.
Daimler-Benz is a case in point. After its acquisition spree in the 1980s it
had a heavyweight rights issue in 1989. Over the past year it has wanted to
raise a further D-Mark 2bn (Pounds 820m) against a difficult market
background. Yet its diversification has prompted criticism and profits are
forecast to fall for the second year running. Disclosure could help keep the
door open to that equity issue.
Improving disclosure
Even without any need to satisfy the requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange and the US Securities Exchange Commission, many German companies
have been improving disclosure and adopting more generous dividend policies.
The trend will continue. Fiscal pressures resulting from unification will
cause Germany's privatisation programme to accelerate; foreign investors
will be needed to help maximise the government's returns. The ageing of the
population could also result in more of the pensions burden being
transferred from the state to funded private pension schemes. That, too,
would create increased demand for equities.
If the general trend towards a more open capital market ultimately tightens
accountability, it may be no bad thing. For all its merits, the German
system of corporate governance has been less effective than its Anglo-Saxon
equivalent in unravelling the damage caused by promiscuous conglomeration.
Supervisory boards have often been slow to push management into focusing on
problems in the core business.
That said, there are clear risks in going down the Anglo-Saxon route. Much
of the success of German industry has been based precisely on harmonious
relations between management and workers within the company, and close
relationships outside, with banks, suppliers, government and community. It
would be ironic if the Germans were to adopt an Anglo-Saxon-style market in
corporate control just as US investors are discovering the joys of
'relationship investing', whereby institutional shareholders make a
long-term commitment to a given company and engage in a continuing dialogue
with the board.
That, however, is unlikely. The innate conservatism of the German financial
system militates against rapid change, as does the powerful vested interest
of the banks - which is why it is conceivable that Germany will end up with
the best of both worlds.

CAPITALISM, CULTURE AND DECLINE IN BRITAIN 1750-1990
By W D Rubinstein
Routledge Pounds 25 182 pages
Of all the competing explanations for Britain's poor economic performance
compared with Germany and the US, the most pervasive is the belief in an
anti-industrial culture. The idea is that for the past 100 years social and
educational attitudes in Britain have been uniquely unfavourable to
industry; this has led to a diversion of talent away from manufacturing to
'softer' activities such as the professions and the civil service.
A powerful restatement of this view came in 1981 with the publication of
Martin Wiener's English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit.
The 'cultural critique' associated with Wiener and others holds that from
about 1870 onwards the upsurge of entrepreneurial vigour which had produced
the industrial revolution was blunted by 'gentrification'. Successful
industrialists sent their sons to public schools where they imbibed
pseudo-aristocratic values that were alien to the single-minded pursuit of
production and profit.
Several historians have questioned Wiener's analysis, but none have done so
with as much force as W D Rubinstein. His new book, which follows several
earlier studies of British elites, is written with wit and passion. It is a
persuasive antidote to many of the cliches about British industrial decline;
its message needs to be absorbed by speechwriters for the prime minister,
John Major, and Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Rubinstein lays into the 'cultural critique' on three main grounds. First,
he attacks its central assumption that Britain shifted from a pro- to an
anti-industrial culture in the course of the 19th century. Second, he
regards the notion of British economic decline as vastly exaggerated, partly
because it reflects an obsession with manufacturing; it fails to take into
account the country's competitive success in services. Third, he finds no
evidence to support the view that the public schools engendered
anti-business attitudes.
Rubinstein says: 'Britain was never fundamentally an industrial and
manufacturing economy; rather it was always, even at the height of the
industrial revolution, essentially a commercial, financial and service-based
economy whose comparative advantage lay with commerce and finance'.
What is sometimes seen as Britain's economic decline was simply a shift of
resources and entrepreneurial energies to other forms of business life. 'In
moving from industry to commerce, Britain's entrepreneurs were responding
intelligently to opportunities. This had little or nothing to do with any
factor in Britain's underlying culture, elite educational system or
fundamental system of values.'
Rubinstein shows that even during the period from 1770 to 1860, when
entrepreneurs in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire were turning
Britain into the workshop of the world, the richest and most powerful group
in the country were the bankers and merchants of London and the home
counties. The dominance of commerce and finance was interrupted by a brief
upsurge of factory capitalism in the first half of the 19th century, 'whose
importance has probably been exaggerated by the fact that it had the world's
first modern factories, by the fact that it is highly visible and
unpleasant, and by the importance given to it by Marxism'.
As for the contention that British culture was anti-industrial, he points
out that if an important indicator of such attitudes is the views of writers
and intellectuals, then German and perhaps even American culture has been
more anti-business than that of Britain. Noting the 'cosmic anti-bourgeois
sarcasm' emanating from Germany's Brechts and other left-wing writers, he
argues that British culture has been much less strident in its condemnation
of capitalism than any other European culture.
In a study of the backgrounds and careers of public schoolboys between 1840
and 1990, Rubinstein shows that few northern industrialists sent their sons
to these establishments; the suggestion that the public schools diverted
talent away from industry is groundless. Sons of financiers were more likely
to have been educated at public schools; yet these were the activities in
which Britain, far from suffering from an anti-entrepreneurial bias,
continued to enjoy a competitive advantage.
In his final chapter Rubinstein discusses the interaction between the
country's three elites - the landed elite, the commercial-based London
elite, and the northern manufacturing elite. The third of these had its
period of greatest influence between 1830 and 1870, but it was never able to
establish a dominance over the other two. 'The self-conscious, acquisitive,
ideologically distinctive provincial elite disappeared in the first world
war, together with its vision of a liberal, meritocratic, provincial civic
culture not dissimilar to that which emerged in 19th century America.'
Rubinstein leaves a number of questions unanswered, not least the issue of
whether the dominance of the metropolis - which is unique among advanced
countries - damaged the economy. His claim that Britain's comparative
advantage has always been in finance and commerce is plausible, but the
balance between manufacturing and services might have been different, and
better for the nation, if the social and business links between London and
the north had been closer.
Manufacturing remains an important part of the economy and those who worry
about its competitiveness are not necessarily suffering from what Rubinstein
calls 'manufacturing fetishism'. What this book does, nevertheless, is to
challenge the conventional wisdom about Britain's Victorian past and thus to
alter the terms of the debate about the country's present and future.

FT  08 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: After the pain, the wait for the gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay-setting institutions have certainly been transformed: fewer workers are
in collective agreements, bargaining is decentralised, the century-old
tradition of 'the rate for the job' has been ruptured, fair wage resolutions
and comparability machinery have been withdrawn, there is greater
sensitivity to the fortunes of the company and the performance of the
individual. The government and their acolytes have achieved virtually all
they set out to do.'
With these words, David Metcalf, professor of industrial relations at the
London School of Economics, summarised the changes in the UK labour market
in the Thatcher decade and beyond. His paper was given at a conference held
on April 1 by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
One of the best illustrations of the changes is the sharp decline in union
membership as a proportion of all employees. Over the short period 1984-90,
the proportion of pay rises determined by collective bargaining fell from 71
per cent to 54 per cent. On the positive side, some 43 per cent of
businesses had cash or share-based profit sharing by 1990, and 32 per cent
had share ownership or option schemes - although in most cases these
provided only a modest proportion of workers' remuneration.
Moreover, in contrast to earlier decades, public and private sector
employers stood up to a series of important strikes. Management's 'right to
manage' was reaffirmed and employers were able to get rid of 'Spanish
practices' in newspapers, airlines, and other last-ditch areas.
There were benefits. As Metcalf says: 'Growth in manufacturing output per
head improved such that Britain was top of the OECD-major seven nations
growth league table in the 1980s, after being bottom in both the 1960s and
1970s. Labour productivity in manufacturing has continued to grow rapidly in
the 1990s reflecting the sharper fall in employment than output. The
improved performance of the manufacturing sector in the 1980s was
attributable to the interaction of greater product competition, high
unemployment and anti-union legislation.'
But there were two disturbing offsetting features. The first relates to the
distribution of income. Mainstream economists say that 'inequality'
increased. The most widely-used measure of inequality is the Gini
co-efficient which has a maximum of 100 and rises as 'inequality' increases.
The UK co-efficient rose (after tax) from 28 in 1981 to 35 in 1988. There
were similar movements in the US. There was no such increase in France, but
the absolute level of 'inequality' remains higher than in the UK.
The term 'inequality' is a loaded one, presupposing that equality is a
natural or desirable state of affairs. But in the case of full-time manual
workers, Paul Gregg and Stephen Machin in their contribution were able to
isolate separate effects. The ratio of earnings of the top tenth of manual
full-time workers to the 'median' workers (those whose pay was in the
middle) increased to the highest since 1886. In itself, there might not be
too much to worry about here - it might be evidence of a widening of
differentials for skilled labour. The real concern is at the bottom. For the
lowest tenth have experienced since 1976 a steady decline in the ratio of
their earnings to the median.
Absolute poverty is a highly complex and controversial area. But it is
difficult to deny the evidence of an increasing trend in the 1980s. At the
very least, a substantial minority did not share in the general prosperity,
when real earnings for those in employment rose at a record pace.
The distributional changes were largely driven by labour market forces, such
as declining relative demand for less skilled workers and occupations. But
the decline in importance of institutions such as unions and minimum wages
played a role.
The second disturbing feature is that even the productivity gains have gone
to waste in unemployment, which seems to be rising to a post-war record. As
Metcalf puts it: 'Either the government got it wrong concerning the link
between pay-setting institutions and procedures and the employment outcomes.
Alternatively, the government got it right about pay setting. In this case
its macroeconomic policy must be a shambles. Either way it is disgraceful
that more than 3m unemployed are needed to implement government policy.'
The clue to the puzzle may have been provided by another participant,
Professor Patrick Minford. He believes that the equilibrium rate of
unemployment (consistent with stable prices or a constant rate of inflation)
did rise in the early 1980s in the aftermath of some Labour policies and
because of mistakes made by the incoming Tory administration, but has since
fallen rapidly.
The particular early Conservative error was the sharp rise in council rents,
fully compensated in unemployment benefit, but only partly in benefits
available to those at work. This much increased the 'why work?' problem, but
became less important as benefits fell in relation to income.
A big element in Prof Minford's view was unionisation, which added 1m to
equilibrium unemployment in the 1970s, but reduced it by 1 1/4 m in the
1980s. A further favourable influence was falling employer taxes on labour.
In sum he believes that equilibrium unemployment, which shot up to 3m in the
early 1980s, has since fallen back rapidly and is now about 1m.
This led Prof Minford to argue in his contribution to the government's panel
of independent forecasters that the economy could take a very large boost
without any danger of renewed inflation. This is in strong contrast to the
Treasury and most commentators, who fear that because of capacity shortages,
the balance of payments or other constraints, anything but a modest recovery
would run into trouble.
Prof Minford's presentation provoked a discussion, ended only by the clock.
If there has been such a large gap between actual and equilibrium
unemployment for most of the past 10 years, why did inflation not fall
further in the middle 1980s; why was the economy not better able to absorb
the credit expansion of the period, and why are prices not actually falling
today?
Fragments of explanation, offered by conference participants, were that it
was not the level of demand in the late 1980s that caused the problem, but
the rate at which it increased. In the 1990s there may be a constraint of
physical capacity biting well before there is any chance of labour shortages
reappearing.
Prof Minford played down capacity restraints. Indeed if output can be
increased without inflationary effects, then capacity will be created by
business. Moreover if unemployment is so far above equilibrium, it should be
possible to cope with any incipient balance of payments problem by having a
lower rate of inflation in the UK than in competitors.
As some recent chancellors will confirm, my own vision of the economic
process is not always the same as Prof Minford's. Nevertheless I prefer his
structural optimism to the economic establishment's tendency to project any
recession or business cycle problem indefinitely into the future.
If there is something in his account, then the effect of the Thatcher labour
market changes is more like what one would have expected. The distribution
of income has been adversely affected, but most of today's unemployment is
due to recession and will be priced back into work with recovery.
Lower unemployment will itself reduce poverty, but probably not enough.
Non-political observers would want to investigate fiscal redistributory
schemes, such as those outlined in James Meade's new collection of essays,
just published by Macmillan, Liberty, Equality and Efficiency. But they
would also seek to retain the more flexible post-Thatcher labour market.

   From Mr MARTIN LAM

<TEXT>
Sir, the logic of Mr Grey's gloss (Letters, April 6) on Mr van den
Muyzenberg's letter (March 30) is incontestable and points up the paradox
that fixed exchange rates must be variable. The worrying question is, how,
in a world abounding with economic and financial information, they can be
varied effectively but without disorder.
If alignments are sizeable the perfect solution would be to make them when
least expected by the market. But this is a contradiction verging on an
absurdity. If, at the other extreme, you wait until the commentators and the
bankers all agree that the moment has come, then you obviously make it easy
for speculators and for those responsible for managing international funds
to place their bets. Conditions for automotive alignment are hard to
envisage. Small, frequent variations are an option, but would look and feel
to the trader rather like floating.
Can the trader and the operator in invisibles have their cake and eat it
too? Or must they simply accept the need to pay for some insurance, in the
form of hedging, against movements in exchange rates which work for, not
against, a reasonable equilibrium?

<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Popham, in his letter 'Best for France and Europe if franc floats'
(April 5), accuses me of misinformation. He predicts 'a small fall followed
by a gradual rise'. Real interest rates should be 3 per cent or, for France
with 2.5 per cent inflation, 5.5 per cent as compared with 10.5 per cent
short term now. What a wondrous world it would be where interest rates could
be halved and there would only be 'a small fall' in the value of the franc]
This is just a technical point. Also Dr Popham wonders why France would link
its currency with the sick German economy. It is because France is now an
integral part of a currency block three quarters the size of the US (in
terms of GNP), if we just include France, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium.
Furthermore, it is well proven that strong currencies lead to strong export
performance, as shown by Germany and Japan, and a weak currency to poor
performance, as shown by the UK. But most important of all is burden
sharing. Devaluation would make it even more difficult for Germany to get
out of the recession and successfully complete unification.
Also, not too long ago the UK wanted the pound to become the strongest
currency in Europe. France wants the same, but that takes time; it takes a
long time for France to wear down its reputation as being prone to
devaluation. France has come a long way. Floating now would throw away
sacrifices already made.
Finally, floating the franc would delay the introduction of a common
European currency, the most powerful tool for increasing European trade and
prosperity.

FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: Schools must not perpetuate artificial educational
barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTAIR THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The secretary of state for education's decision to give a much higher
profile to vocational qualifications in recent weeks ('Patten vows to
improve the skills base', April 6) is particularly welcome given the implied
message within your own second leader of the same day ('Testing times').
While agreeing wholeheartedly that Mr Patten needs to talk to the teaching
profession about testing and about the national curriculum, I would take
issue with the assumptions behind your editorial's critique that it falls
into 'the twin traps of being insufficiently challenging for academic
children, while neglecting the basic skills others need for the world of
work'. Though intended to show the over-prescriptive nature of the national
curriculum, this illustration perpetuates an outmoded academic/vocational
division. Whatever flaws it has, a national school curriculum must seek,
surely, to stretch all children, not just the most academic? Equally it
should ensure that every child is equipped with at least some of the skills
needed for earning a living.
Implying that sufficient intellectual challenge is important for 'academic
children' while it is more necessary that 'others' should become skilled for
the world of work is not helpful to anyone. If the largely artificial
barrier between academic and vocational learning is being broken down in
higher education, it would be sad to see it maintained in schooling.
Without sharing the government's commitment to maintaining the A-level
system unchanged, it is possible to sympathise with Mr Patten's objective of
presenting people, whatever their age, with an attractive vocational option
that encourages more people to contribute to raising the country's skill
base. The alternative is to consign work-related learning to a second-best
ghetto area.

Sir, With the volume of column inches expended on the Hoover promotion, I am
a little surprised that nobody has looked at the much larger
Sainsbury/British Airways promotion which took place at about the same time.
As a result of some careful planning of my shopping, I acquired vouchers
that would have entitled me to two reduced air fares. Sainsbury/BA further
rewarded me with two additional 'bonus' vouchers. I have found these to be
valueless. On flights since Christmas, all on BA, I have been able to book
tickets through West End agents considerably cheaper than the BA
'reductions'.
I have probably lost nothing (and may have gained a little) as a result of
rescheduling purchases to boost my total expenditure at Sainsbury during the
crucial period. Certainly Sainsbury gained some of my market share at the
time, but in the immortal words of rock star Pete Townsend, I 'won't get
fooled again'. And my expectation is that Sainsbury will not actually spend
very much on subsidising air tickets under its scheme.

FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: ACT and pensions: short-term gain but long-term loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID G V HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read Norma Cohen's article on Budget changes to ACT
and its effect on pensions ('Worse off at the end of the day', April 5).
There are many things about current government policy which are difficult to
understand other than on purely hard-nosed money terms (for example, closure
of mental hospitals and cuts in legal aid). But even on those terms,
considering that in future an increasing percentage of the population will
be in the older age brackets, it surely makes good long-term fiscal sense to
encourage people to provide for their retirement years. Retirees who have
made adequate pension provisions will be less of a drain on public resources
in the years to come.
From your reports and others I have read, it seems that the government is
charting a course of short-term fiscal gain at the expense of long-term
policy.

PARIS IS BURNING
Jennie Livingston
Star City, Arkansas, and Rustwater, Kansas, are both small towns near the
middle of America. But look closely - is there a big difference? Exactly.
One is in Jim Thompson country, the other is in Sinclair Lewis country.
Star City is the small town as rural spittoon. In the irresistibly grimy,
downbeat thriller One False Move - scripted by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom
Epperson but surely ghost-dictated by that master of elevated pulp J.
Thompson - the town plays host to fugitive gangsters, dimwitted lawmen and a
climactic carnage that Aeschylus would be proud of.
Up the road a little - go north and bend left - is Rust-water in wheatbelt
Kansas. For displaced urban crime read agriculture under stress. There is a
drought here and the farms are dying; and if one pastoral crisis is not
enough, here comes another. Revivalist preacher Jonas Nightengale (Steve
Martin), comedy-cloned by screenwriter Janus Cercone from Sinclair Lewis's
Elmer Gantry, passes through town with his all-singing, all-praying tent
show. He gives the rain-starved farmers hope; he raiseth the lame and sick
(the language is catching); he thumps his Bible; and he is a frightful,
pearly-teethed fraud made winning by the charismatic Mr Martin.
When films venture outside Los Angeles they usually end up in Cutesville,
USA. See ET, Back To The Future and Co. To Hollywood any place without smog,
faxes and power breakfasts must seem strange and innocent. But One False
Move, by a mile the better of the week's rural twosome, makes a rich dark
joke of this (faux)-navete. At the centre: a young Southern sheriff (Bill
Paxton) intent on proving his mettle to two visiting lawmen (one white, one
black) from Los Angeles. All the Angelenos want to do is to round up a pair
of cocaine-dealing killers (also one black, one white) who massacred a
roomful of people back in LA and then fled with their guns, their drugs and
their girl (Cynthia Williams). Will they come to ground in the girl's home
town of Star City, Ark.?
Not yet. First the movie, directed with sizzling grace by ex-actor Carl
Franklin, travels all over the south-western states as the getaway trio make
for Houston (to sell their drugs) before being harried by police pursuit
into doubling back north for Arkansas. Back here the film's other character
grouping has been in mocking parallel action. For two black/white crooks
with a brown-skinned girl read two black/white city cops with a redneck
sheriff.
The racial patch-quilting, though teasingly displayed, is never deployed for
facile tension. Indeed Southern values are almost respected for their loony
matter-of-factness. Paxton's pinbrained lawman is a creation so ridiculous
it is sublime. He boasts, he bumbles, he preens. And he obliviously throws
out the word 'nigger' while his black colleague pretends polite deafness.
Even the sheriff's wife shakes her head at his intellect, while
simultaneously advertising her own. ('He watches TV, I read non-fiction'.)
And when her man goes off to do what a man's gotta do, the film moves into a
High Noon climax re-staged - brilliantly - as nihilist farce.
One False Move is a rural tragicomedy with the deadly grace of a sidewinder.
Leap Of Faith is more like a stoned python. It folds itself round its
subject's neck, makes some promising hissing noises - and then falls asleep
on the job. We love the sight of Martin dancing into town with his big-band
show of dubious miracles: orchestrated by Debra Winger at the backstage
computer, feeding audience information into Martin's on-stage earpiece. 'Man
in white shirt, hard of hearing', 'Woman in pink with arthritis'. Then the
slapping-on of hands, the customer's fainting fall, the lordy-lordy
paroxysms of ersatz joy.
Unfortunately, something else in the movie soon reveals itself as ersatz. It
is the subplot. Make that two subplots: for while Winger romances the
improbably saintly town sheriff Liam Neeson - so handsome, so gentle, so
liberal (no redneckery in this burg) - Martin makes a play for diner
waitress Lolita Davidovitch. She has a crippled, chess-playing little
brother (Lukas Haas of Witness) who will surely, if Cliff Eidelman's music
has not done the job by then, end by melting his and our hearts.
Can a real miracle happen? Yes indeed. For lo, the cinema exit doors finally
open before we have all passed out with terminal queasiness. Director
Richard Pearce (Heartland, No Mercy) delivers the razzle-dazzle in the
revivalist set pieces, with Martin exploding all over stage. But no
star-director team can keep their anti-twaddle guns firing in the face of
both the appointed target - high-sleaze evangelism - and a whole lot of
late, unscheduled fire from Hollywood inspirationalism.
* You cannot escape small-town life even, or especially, in Sweden. Sven
Nykvist's The Ox is about pastoral bigotry and brutalism. A terrible fate
befalls Helge Roos (Stellan Skarsgard) when he kills a neighbour's ox to
feed himself and his family during Sweden's 1860s famine. Flogged and
life-sentenced to hard labour, he is then betrayed by his starving wife for
the sake of their starving child. Nor, gentle reader, does the horror stop
there . . .
This truth-based tragedy of errors makes Thomas Hardy seem like Louisa May
Alcott. It also makes for spellbinding cinema. Writer-director Nykvist is
best-known as a cameraman to the great and famous, having lensed 22 Ingmar
Bergmans, three (serious) Woody Allens and a Tarkovsky.
After a training like that, manic depression or emergent movie mastery can
be the only outcome. Nykvist here makes images that burn the eye. The early
winter scenes are inspired crayon-and-charcoal sketches, all ashy clouds,
ember-yellow sunsets and crispy, silhouetted blacks. They are followed by
the desaturated, mold-grey prison scenes, resembling a mortuarist's photo
album. And even when the film bounces back briefly to May-time, the colours
are caustic, garish, mocking.
Assembling his cast from the Ingmar Bergman Who's Who of Acting - Liv
Ullman, Max Von Sydow, Erland Josephson and Fanny And Alexander's Ewa
Frohling as the wife - Nykvist kneads the faces with light and shadow as a
baker kneads dough. There is no flicker of false emotion as he shapes the
story into a picture of provincial life both cruelly plausible and
sumptuously satirical. Von Sydow's dithery priest and Ullman's lady of the
manor, specialising in milky-eyed looks and arm's-length kindness, show the
tattered raiment of charity in times of social despair. And Stellan
Skarsgard, an actor whose flayed looks and sleep-robbed eyes haunt the mind,
finds Dostoevskian depth in the hapless ox-killer. In sum: a triumph.
Is there anything else? Yes, but if you have a bus to catch I can run
through them quickly. Best Of The Best 2 is the sequel to a film no one
seems to have seen. Reportedly it starred Eric Roberts (Julia's brother) and
Chris Penn (Sean's brother), now re-teamed for 90 minutes of cheerful drivel
as two kickboxers trying to kick an evil wall of muscle called Brakus (Ralph
Moeller). Place: Las Vegas. Toupee'd Wayne Newton, looking mature enough to
be Isaac's brother, steals the show as the sleazy emcee.
You can always see the three-year-old drag documentary Paris Is Burning at
the ICA. Director Jennie Livingston shows us round New York's 'vogueing'
couples, as the entire black and Hispanic poulations of Brooklyn and Harlem
seem to have spent 1990 coming out and loudly refusing to go back in again.
Bold, if rather old, stuff.

FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Ballet on the doorstep - The ENB's regional tours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Ballet makes an amoeba-like split for the next month to
encompass two small-scale tours of the regions. The scheme is of proven
value as we know from previous years. Audiences that might not expect to see
ballet of this quality on their doorsteps, benefit. New work is encouraged
without prohibitive cost. The dead hand of the 'classics' is lifted from the
box-office. Dancers find new roles and challenges. All's for the best, and
if - as on Tuesday night in High Wycombe - some of the programme is a bit
below par, there are rewards in seeing dancers blossom in a fresh repertory.
ENB was appearing in High Wycombe at the new (November 1992) Swan Theatre.
The building is light, spacious, well-planned. Civilised loos. The
auditorium seats just over a thousand in comfort. Sight lines are good; the
stage is excellent for middle-scale dance; the theatre and bar staff are
courteous and seem actually to care that the public is present. (So unlike
certain of our own dear metropolitan fun-palaces.)
The key to the programme was the first performance of The Seven Silences of
Salome - over-sibilant title - by the Portuguese choreographer Olga Roriz,
who made an impressive Thirteen Gestures of the Body for the Gulbenkian
Ballet.
This is bare-foot territory - as was everything in the evening except for
the Don Quixote duet - and the piece comes with an addled programme-note
which avers that the seven men in the cast are 'multiple images of John the
Baptist' who dance their individual tributes to Salome, and that the whole
thing is 'a dream developed by a woman about the desire of another woman who
has never existed'. After that, I would happily believe that Mme Roriz was
also laying claim to the throne of Peru. It is intellectual hocus-pocus.
What we see is seven men who dress up in seven items of flimsy female
clothing (they look foolish enough to appear on the cat-walk of almost any
British fashion show) and then perform brief, vivid solos. Salome does not
appear.
The value of the piece is that Mme Roriz offers an individual and convincing
dance-language which gives the men splendid opportunities. Movement is
anxious, feverish, built upon quick, bright gesture and jagged-edged action.
Performances are fine, committed. The men are Alexis Manuel, Paul Lewis,
Denzil Bailey (who has a variation of great rhythmic sophistication, which
he does admirably well), Maurizio Bellezza, Tim Almaas, Thomas Edur and
Stephen Sherriff. I thought Mr Sherriff extraordinary, even in this
distinguished company, by reason of the emotional concentration of his
playing. He has, from his days as a soloist with the Royal Ballet, been an
artist to watch with gratitude. Here he achieves even more impressive
stature: the role, the dance, take fire.
This Salome is a welcome arrival in the repertory showing the men of the
troupe as serious and gifted artists. There is an insistently clangorous
electronic score by Antonio Emiliano; simple and effective decor by Nuno
Carinhas. Sponsorship comes from Portugal 600.
American choreographies framed the programme: Paul Taylor's Aureole, which
no one on stage understood, for performances were neither buoyant enough nor
exact enough in gesture; and David Parson's two jokes, Sleep Study and The
Envelope. The pyjama-ed figures of the first are quite amusing, the piece
happily brief; the romping of the second goes on for ever. Hero of this was
the pianist Kevin Darvas who played a Rossini mish-mash with a nice wit. In
the Don Quixote pas de deux, Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur did what they did
efficiently. Neither convinced me and Mr Edur is too valuable an artist to
be wasted on this horse-play.
ENB's tours Britain with two programmes until May 8.

FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Pierre Bonnard - Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I would like to appear with the wings of a butterfly before the young
painters of the year 2000,' wrote Pierre Bonnard a hundred years ago.
Bonnard: the Happiness of Paintings, the title of a comprehensive new
exhibition in Dusseldorf gathered from public and private collections across
Europe and America, speaks for both the man and the work. In huge canvas
after huge canvas, Bonnard distilled his preoccupations with a contented,
domestic life in images of iridescent colour and Arcadian brightness. No
painter invites so closely a feeling of instant introduction into an
everyday scene, of joining the family in the garden, the couple by
lamplight, or even the cat peering over the tablecloth.
Picasso hated this untroubled charm and called Bonnard 'piddling'. Like his
friend and fellow intimiste Edouard Vuillard, Bonnard suffered for much of
this century from modernist dismissal as bourgeois, decorative, superficial.
In the last 20 years, his work has swung back into favour; the scholarly
catalogue (DM39) to this show teases out roots in 18th-century French art as
well as the influence of Gauguin, the other Nabiss and the Symbolists, and
proposes Bonnard as a precursor of Americans such as Jackson Pollock.
But walk into any room here and it is Bonnard the pure painter who matters
and attracts. Personal and intimate, with a dash of humour never found in
Vuillard, he is always fresh and loyal to his own vision, a perfectionist in
each minute detail. Years after he had sold a work to a museum he used to
sneak in, wait for the curator to move to another room, and furtively whip
out a brush and tube of paint to alter a fragment that still bothered him.
He was born in 1867 into a liberal bourgeois family who did not object when
he gave up law for art. His sister married the composer Claude Terrasse in
1890 and it is the Terrasse family that features in the early, monumental
group pictures of uncles and children and dogs and outdoor tables laid for
lunch, such as L'Apres-midi bourgeoise. Like the work of his contemporary,
Proust, this is the quintessential idyll of bourgeois indolence and elegant
leisure; it is also a wonderfully ironic comment on social stiffness and
ennui, with the family lined up in a row, each with enough room to stand or
sit but not to unfold or relax. Thus did Bonnard charge his cosy sunlit
spaces with psychological overtones.
After he settled down with his wife Marthe, social pictures were rare. The
Bonnards were reclusive, living first in Normandy a few miles from Giverney
 -Monet used to drive over to see the latest work; 'of the two,' said a
witness, 'Bonnard spoke rather more, but that was hardly at all' - then in a
village near Cannes.
From both homes, Bonnard painted landscapes, trees, blossoms, fruit, brought
within the bounds of his own world. The exterior plays against the interior
so that the viewer must find his way - to the vista seen through an open
window, across a veranda, from a table on a terrace. In the enclosed,
luxuriant gardens in mauves, pinks and oranges that are Bonnard's lifelong
motifs, the close-ups, the bowl of fruit, the check tablecloth, are the
lasting images. The piquant and personal are the joys of Bonnard: the
composition of The Cherry Tart, with its red fruit, blue table and green
foliage screening the landscape beyond, might have been set up for him to
paint the greedy eyes of the dog whose nose just reaches the tart.
The round, childish face and slender body of Marthe, muse and model, is
often the sole figure here; in the 1912 Nature morte a la figure, she is
caught so still and calm that she seems part of a still-life. In the famous
'bath tub' series, delightfully brought together for this show, she is a
naked, known woman unlike any other nude. Even Degas' simple nudes washing
and drying have a mix of sensuality and gracelessness where Marthe is
delicate, unsophisticated, hips and breasts unemphasised, body in its
shimmer of light almost more abstract than the interwoven surfaces, mirrors
and coloured tiles, which luminously reflect her figure.
Bonnard does not try to explain her or anyone else; even in the last
Self-portrait of 1945, painted after the deaths of Marthe and Vuillard, he
stares, frail and alone, from the other side of a glass, his gaze directed
beyond us. Some of the sparkling decorative pictures, suffused with
well-being and memories of happiness, that he painted at the time of the
portrait appear with it here; they show an aging Bonnard still true to the
claim he made in the 1890s: 'I belong to no school. I only want to do
something of my own.'
Bonnard: Das Gluck zu Malen, Kunst-sammlung, Dusseldorf, to April 12.

FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Wolfgang Holzmair - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a couple of years Wolfgang Holzmair's Lieder singing seemed to be the
best-kept secret of Wigmore Hall audiences. On one occasion I recall the
young Austrian baritone looking genuinely surprised at his reception. No
more; these days he is to be found in recital across several continents and
plentiful recordings are promised.
He has taken strides forward since his London debut four years ago.
Tuesday's programme at the Wigmore Hall was all Schubert, taking
Schwanengesang as its backbone, but adding extra songs with words by Seidl
and Rellstab to give it body. Brigitte Fassbaender and Peter Schreier have
offered the same basic idea before, but they did not start with the last
song, 'Die Taubenpost', and then sing it again for an encore, as Holzmair
did - a strange idea, but not unpleasing.
His accompanist on this occasion was a noted Schubert pianist in her own
right, Imogen Cooper. Unlike Andra's Schiff, who was in the audience, she
did not accompany with a soloist's flair. The Bosendorfer's lid was firmly
down; the sound was unvaryingly soft and demure, leaving Holzmair's baritone
to take the limelight for itself.
It was difficult to call this a partnership in any meaningful sense.
Beautifully moulded though her playing was, Cooper did not really dramatise
the songs at all. By the time she had reached a contrasting mood, Holzmair
was up and away, several new ideas further on. He has always been a restless
singer, apt to veer from one dynamic extreme to the other in quick
succession, but a far greater degree of discipline is now in evidence.
At his best - a seductive 'Liebesbotschaft', a powerful 'Der Doppelganger' -
it is difficult to think of another young recitalist to match him. Holzmair
has a lot to say about the music he sings and the technique (except in those
awkward octave rises of 'Kriegers Ahnung') to put it across. His baritone
sounds as though it was born with its wide range of expression. Meltingly
romantic tone colours and bitter, dark anger come to it with equal ease.
The conclusion must be that Holzmair is well on target to fulfil his early
promise. Incidentally, the second time that he sang 'Die Taubenpost' was
even better than the first - a knowing and affectionate smile in the voice
that worked as well for this song as any performance I can remember.

FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Benvenuto Cellini - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have Parisians even now really come to terms with Berlioz? In the listing
columns of a leading newspaper the other day, readers were urged to see the
Opera Bastille's new production of Benvenuto Cellini 'to persuade themselves
that this opera is decidedly not Berlioz's masterpiece'. How negative can
you get? And who said Cellini was his masterpiece? Even if it is not on a
level with The Trojans or that wonderful not-quite-opera The Damnation of
Faust, Cellini is a riproaring heartwarming piece of High Romanticism and
self-justification, demanding a place in the national repertory.
It was with The Trojans, in a production that by all accounts failed to set
the Seine on fire, that the Bastille opened almost four years ago. Cellini
is in the main a big success - done well, Berlioz can be relied upon to draw
large audiences in spite of his detractors. Conductor Myung-Whun Chung and
the willing Opera orchestra hurled themselves whole-heartedly at the music.
Though the quieter moments - the lovely duet for Teresa and Ascanio for
example - made their effect, some of the playing was a shade too brash and
brassy, obscuring detail. Plenty of vitality, not enough light and shade.
The producer, Denis Krief, whose Sapho (Gounod) I enjoyed at Saint-Etienne
last season, designed his own sets, costumes and lighting. The result had
unusual homogeneity, a swirling, sweeping, restless evocation of Renaissance
Rome with magical evocations of the Piazza Colonna and the Colosseum -
painted architectural sets in the grand theatrical style of Berlioz's time.
Good to see the big Bastille stage uninhibitedly used, even if the width
meant stringing out the carnival crowds in long lines like a frieze.
Everything was generously planned - yards of material for the riotously
colourful, painterly costumes (as good in motion as they were when still).
What a blessed, wicked pleasure to have an opera evening far away from
clamped-on ideas and strenuous visual ugliness] Could it be, bearing the
Opera-Comique's Mireille in mind, that reaction is on the way?
The 'King Midas' pantomime on Cassandro's trestle stage at the carnival was
elaborately staged, with the stabbing of Pompeo a focal point. I cannot say
I followed the twists and turns of the casting of the statue, but there was
a genuine, growing excitement. At the moment of triumph, a giant impression
of Perseus the height of the proscenium arch was flashed on to a gauze - no
feeble imitation of a bronze figure.
So much for the eye to enjoy occasionally endangered the story line but not
for long. Krief never allowed comedy to topple into farce. The Pope (Romuald
Tesarowicz) and his treasurer Balducci (Jean-Phillipe Courtis) were not
caricatured but shown as potentially tricky opponents, symbols of Cellini's
uneasy relationship with authority (for which read Berlioz and the official
Paris of the 1830s).
Cellini, the goldsmith of genius who was also a brawler, was sung with
swagger and thoughtfulness by Chris Merritt, whose voice has a useful streak
of hard metal as well as Rossini-tenor agility. That voice was taxed by the
role, but the worrying unsteadiness of the opening scenes lessened.
Merritt's appearance combined burliness with distinction of bearing.
The Teresa of Deborah Riedel, full-toned and positive in manner, was the
best I have seen - for once the girl seemed a worthy partner for the artist.
The Ascanio of Diana Montague and Fieramosca of Michel Trempont were
excellent. Much of the evening's musical excitement came from the Opera's
fine chorus, especially the tenors and basses who sang so lustily as
Cellini's fellow-craftsmen.

FT  08 APR 93 / People: Rolls-Royce's Japanophilia now encompasses Sanders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the appointment of Keith Sanders to a senior managerial role at its
Crewe headquarters, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars should gain some helpful insights
into what makes Toyota's Lexus luxury car franchise tick.
Lexus cars may be a rung or two down the prestige - to say nothing of price
 -ladder from Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. But they have gained an envied
reputation for quality and reliability since Toyota launched the brand in
the late 1980s, and wreaked considerable damage to the sales of European
makes like Mercedes and Jaguar in world car markets.
Coming to Rolls, where he has been appointed director of UK operations, from
his previous post as field operations director at Toyota (Great Britain),
Sanders, 48, has had a warts-and-all view of the debut of what is probably
the most luxurious model in the range of Japanese cars in the UK
marketplace.
Rolls-Royce's interest in the subject has been stirred by the big quality
and productivity gains it is achieving from what it describes as a
manufacturing 'revolution' at Crewe, where in the past 18 months there has
been a wholesale adoption of Japanese-style practices. Breakeven has been
more than halved to 1,400 cars a year in around 24 months.
Sanders, who has also worked for Ford and Nissan, will be responsible for
all Rolls' sales-related activities in the UK. He is taking over from
Bernard Preston, who is appointed quality director.

FT  08 APR 93 / People: Conway moves to top of DEC from IBM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for a replacement for Geoff Shingles, Britain's longest serving
computer boss, is over. Digital Equipment, the US minicomputer maker and
computing services company, has announced that the top slot in its UK
subsidiary would be filled by Chris Conway, a 48-year-old battle-hardened
computer industry veteran.
His first task will be to ensure the company is in shape for a worldwide
reorganisation due for completion by July 1 this year. Conway seems to
relish the challenge: 'I think I can bring a sense of urgency to Digital,'
he says. 'In my view there should be less debate and more implementation.'
Strong words for an executive steeped for the past 27 years in the corporate
culture of International Business Machines, a company whose current troubles
are widely ascribed to a reluctance to take tough decisions quickly enough.
Conway's management record is impressive, however; a specialist in the
finance industry and systems integration, he led the IBM team which won
prime contractor role on the Royal Navy's Merlin EH101 helicopter.
Born in what was then Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, he has lived in the
UK since 1969 with a spell in Paris managing IBM's Nordic territories.
Leaving IBM was an enormous wrench, he says, but Digital, once Big Blue's
arch enemy, represented 'a lifetime opportunity'.
Geoff Shingles stays on as chairman with a mission to raise the company
profile and help with sales to government.

dangers which he believes may result from the countryside being exploited.
Just A Gigolo is a comedy starring the ubiquitous Tony Slattery playing an
out-of-work teacher who falls into the escort business (8.30 ITV). Kristin
Scott Thomas stars as a reluctant nun in Body And Soul, a six-part drama
starting on ITV (9.00). Released from the convent to attend her brother's
funeral, she 'shows herself to be an astute business woman as she begins to
take over the family mill'. Presenter David Jessel and the team who made
'Rough Justice' for the BBC have formed their own company to make similar
miscarriage-of-justice programmes for Channel 4 to be called Trial And Error
(9.30).

FT  08 APR 93 / People: Aston Martin Lagonda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former Ford executive Nick Fry has landed a bigger job than he perhaps
bargained for when he first joined Aston Martin Lagonda in last August.
That was as operations director. Now he has been made managing director at a
time when the luxury sports carmaker, owned by Ford since 1987, is poised
for one of the biggest expansionary leaps in its 70-year history.
The company is cranking up to quadruple production to 800 cars a year in
1995, by means of a new 'cheap' Aston, the DB7, destined to sell for the
paltry sum - by Aston standards - of less than Pounds 80,000.
Past models have mostly been designed, developed and built at Newport
Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, and the more expensive models will continue to be
built there. But the DB7 will be produced at a separate factory being
equipped at Bloxham, Oxon, with the main design and development undertaken
in Kidlington, Oxon, by TWR (Design), part of Tom Walkinshaw's TWR group.
Not only will Fry have day-to-day supervision of this three-ring production
'circus', he is also charged with new product planning and overseeing the
expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide sales and service organisation which
is a necessary accompaniment to the arrival of the DB7.

<TEXT>
Television has never been awfully good at Easter. Not so many years ago we
used to have circuses, but those have gone and nothing much has taken their
place ..unless you count A Song For Europe which certainly has some
circus-like qualities (8.30 BBC1). This is not the Eurovision Song Contest,
of course, but the programme in which Britain's entry for that competition
is chosen. Earlier in the day (a video recorder would seem to be in order)
Channel 4 brings what some of us regard as the greatest piece of music of
any sort ever written: Bach's St Matthew Passion (9.30am). First heard on
Good Friday 264 years ago, it is performed today by the Neubeuern Choral
Society and the Bach Collegium in the Romanesque church of Alpirsbach. It
lasts 3 1/4 hours. Bookmark screens the first of a two-part biography of
Philip Larkin (9.40 BBC2).

FT  08 APR 93 / Technology: From inspiration to bestseller - Andrew Fisher
ends a series on innovation by asking why Britain's performance lags behind
other countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ALL the words written on innovation in the past few years were translated
into performance, Britain would have one of the most successful economies in
the world. Innovation has been the subject of numerous seminars, speeches
and publications, with industry exhorted to shake itself up and develop the
ideas, products and strategies needed to come out ahead in international
markets.
There is no doubt the UK has plenty of corporate winners, especially in
sectors such as pharmaceuticals, retailing and some parts of manufacturing -
aerospace, electronics and engineering. But the country also seems to have
more than its fair share of plodders and losers. Innovation and
competitiveness are hard to measure, but the UK does poorly in world league
tables by most statistical yardsticks.
While that much is indisputable, there is a good deal of disagreement about
the causes of this lagging performance and possible ways to put it right.
Industrialists, academics and economists generally agree, however, that the
process of innovation is hard to define. Nor are there any easy models for
innovation-hungry companies to follow.
'Just having innovative technology is not enough to claim true innovation,'
Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, the Japanese electronics concern, said in a
lecture to The Royal Society. Also required is creativity in both product
planning and marketing. 'Innovative management demands that all phases of
the operation be seen as links in a single chain of innovation.'
Scientific endeavour is clearly an important element in most innovation, but
it is by no means the only or dominant factor. Howard Newby, chairman of the
Economic and Social Research Council, says: 'Innovation does not
automatically spring from scientific invention and go on inevitably to
produce a competitive edge for companies.'
Josef Schumpeter, the Austrian-born economist, described three phases of
technological change: invention, or the discovery of new ideas and methods;
innovation, which means making these commercially useful; and diffusion, the
spreading of the resulting products and processes to available markets.
Economic study has shown that more than 80 per cent of US productivity
growth in the first half of this century stemmed from technological
innovation.
In Britain today, the economy suffers from the lack of a strong
technological base, according to Paul Stoneman, a professor at Warwick
Business School. 'Unless the UK invests more heavily in new technology, it
will not be able to generate the extra productivity and new products that it
needs to compete successfully in international markets and will continue its
relative decline.'
Corporate research and development declined in Britain as a percentage of
gross domestic product in the 1980s, but rose in Germany, Japan, the US and
France. ICI, Britain's top spender on research and development, is 35th in
world terms, with Glaxo, the second biggest UK R&amp;D spender, in 49th place.
In Stoneman's opinion, the UK's relatively poor performance results from the
government's short-term policies of demand stimulation and use of interest
rates as a policy weapon - both leading to economic volatility - the
short-term view taken on capital markets, the shortage of skilled workers
and over-reliance by the government on market forces.
Recently, the government has tried to become more supportive of industry.
Stoneman believes the forthcoming White Paper on Science and Technology
'could revolutionise policy towards the stimulation of Britain's
technological base'.
Even if this does occur, the need to manage and control ideas and invention
will remain a priority. Companies which blaze new scientific and
technological trails do not always succeed commercially. One of several
telling examples cited by John Kay, professor of economics at the London
Business School, is EMI, the British company which pioneered the CAT scanner
in medical technology, but then ran into financial troubles.
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has developed original products such
as the audio cassette and the compact disc. Today, its finances are in
disarray. In his new book, Foundations of Corporate Success, Kay makes the
point that innovation needs to be accompanied by other types of competence
such as management, marketing and organisational strength and flexibility.
Also, technology can be copied.
'Innovation is, by its very nature, costly and uncertain,' he writes. It is
also hard to manage. Kay warns against putting too much faith in technology
at the expense of other skills. 'A common business mistake is to believe
that innovation can compensate for competitive disadvantages in other areas.
Such a strategy is almost never effective.'
Reputation is important in persuading people to buy innovative products, Kay
adds. 'Customers will buy untried Sony products because of the strength of
Sony's innovative record.' Interestingly, Morita uses the example of the
Walkman portable cassette player to show that successful products do not
have to be technologically advanced, even in electronics. 'Frankly, it did
not contain any breakthrough technology. Its success was based on product
planning and marketing.'
It is this emphasis on the marketability of innovative products, backed up
by management and other skills, that the Department of Industry, the
Confederation of British Industry, the ESRC (independent, but
government-backed) and other innovation-minded organisations are keen to
promote in Britain. The DTI and CBI have begun a programme which seeks to
tell companies how best to change their ways; a study last year found only
one-tenth of UK concerns were truly innovative, though half showed some of
the right elements.
'One of the problems we have is overcoming inertia,' comments Joe Carr, one
of five industrialists seconded to the DTI's innovation unit - in his case
from TI Group. 'We've got to catch the hearts and minds of chief
executives.' He believes UK companies should be more open in the way they
exchange and share technology and ideas and also be more willing to enter
into alliances with other companies to enhance product and market strength.
Communication, both inside companies and outside to investors, suppliers and
consumers, is widely seen as essential to successful innovation. Richard
Scase, professor of organisational behaviour at Kent University, thinks UK
companies - especially in manufacturing - often fall down badly here.
'People in the manufacturing process often don't see innovation as part of
their responsibility and concentrate on production only.' Many R&amp;D
departments also operate in partial isolation from the rest of the company -
'the traditional argument is that boffins must be kept away from the coal
face'.
In the view of John Fisher, technical director at PA Consulting Group, many
companies - not just in the UK - do not use their R&amp;D talents properly.
'They've got cupboards full of ideas that no one appreciates,' he says.
'It's not so much a question of spending more or less on R&amp;D, it's one of
maximising effectiveness.'
Yet that is easier said than done. 'It can be very difficult to know if you
have a winner or not,' says Ian Harvey, chief executive of British
Technology Group, which licenses products around the world. It was 10 years
before magnetic resonance imaging, the latest-generation body scanner
developed from academic research, became successful in the medical equipment
market.
Innovation requires vision, courage and persistence as well as technological
and management expertise. Failures are inevitable in the drive to find
winning products, but that is part of the price for seeking to turn
inspiration into success in the world market place.

FT  08 APR 93 / Technology: Desperately seeking an angel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For innovators who have made their products attractive enough for the market
and want to expand, the search for funds can be frustrating. Enter the
'business angel', a successful entrepreneur who is probably over 35,
comfortably off rather than super-rich and dislikes publicity.
Angels are keen to use their money to help young enterprises which find it
hard to raise money elsewhere. With venture capital difficult to attract and
the UK government's Business Expansion Scheme diverted into such
non-productive areas as property, angels are eagerly sought out.
Business angels - the commercial equivalent of the Broadway angels in the
New York theatrical world - were first identified and defined in the US, but
clearly have a role to play wherever budding entrepreneurs look for capital.
The problem is they are hard to find. Thus matching the two sides is not
easy. Angels tend to invest near where they live or operate and often in
sectors they know something about. 'They know what they don't want to invest
in, but otherwise they are fairly open,' says Colin Mason, senior lecturer
in economic geography at Southampton University.
Together with Richard Harrison, management development professor at Ulster
Business School, Mason has studied the activities of business angels in
Britain. A recent paper by the two men suggested the informal capital pool
represented by angels could total between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn,
compared with the Pounds 1bn or so a year invested by institutional venture
capital funds. Thus, they concluded: 'Business angels would appear to
represent a significant and under-utilised source of finance for small
business in the UK.' While they generally invest between Pounds 10,000 and
Pounds 30,000 in a business, a minority will put in more than Pounds 50,000.
British angels tend to invest alone, while many US angels work in syndicates
headed by an 'archangel'.
While angels may get a kick out of their investments, Mason stresses: 'They
are not philanthropists. They want a financial return.' Other factors do
play a secondary role, though. 'Sometimes, they may act partly out of social
obligation or altruism - this is more common in the US - but the fun factor
does come through.'
In the UK, around 15 per cent of angels' investments are directed towards
high-technology areas, far less than in advanced technology areas in the US
such as California.
Most angels are 'hands on' investors, says Mason. 'This means the business
is getting more than just money; it is getting the investor's skill, money,
knowledge and contacts.'
Those in search of angels' funds are more likely to find them if they are
based in the US, where their total is put at between Dollars 10bn (Pounds
7bn) and Dollars 20bn, rather than in the UK. Venture Capital Network was
set up in 1984 in the New England states of the US with business support. It
is now run as an affiliate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Clones of VCN have been set up in Canada and other parts of the US, though
not all have been successful. VCN operates as a computer-matching
information agency and not as a vetting or recommendation service. Mason
would like to see a similar operation in the UK, possibly funded by the
government which has already launched a pilot scheme.
Also keen for a more efficient way of introducing angels to technology
ventures is National Westminster Bank, which will undertake feasibility
studies aimed at doing this in Oxford and north-west England, regions of
heavy research and manufacturing activity. 'If this works,' says Peter Ives,
manager at NatWest's Technology Unit, 'we will do a national database.' The
EC is also looking at ways of putting European angels in touch with start-up
and early-stage companies seeking funds.
However, the relationship between entrepreneurial investors and young
companies is not always angelic. Sometimes business angels become
overbearing and disruptive. Then, they are called 'devils'.

FT  08 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charting the tastes
of China's consumers - Lynne Curry meets two market researchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time of sweeping social and economic change, Yuan Yue and Li Kan
represent a new breed of Chinese revolutionaries.
Both men run organisations analysing a phenomenon that barely existed a
decade ago - the growing clout of China's increasingly prosperous consumers.
Yuan is the assistant president of China Market Research Institute. Li is
the general manager of Connections Consulting Company.
The two companies are among a dozen or so market research groups that have
sprung up in the last year, some based in Beijing, others working in the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in Guangdong province as partners of Hong
Kong companies. All of them are geared towards charting the tastes of the
new class of consumer produced by the country's capitalistic-style economic
reforms.
'Market research is a new concept for Chinese enterprises because consumers
had no choice under a totally state-run system,' said Yuan.
Yuan and Li are at the forefront of the drive to develop this industry,
carrying out market research on consumer products ranging from shampoo to
gum to computers and copiers, and testing the market for those not yet
available in China.
But with China's increasingly complex economy, Yuan and Li have adopted
different approaches towards marketing in the country.
Yuan's China Market Research Institute uses a variety of western polling
techniques: focus groups, door-to-door interviews, the telephone and
mailings.
The institute's 68 employees contact between 500 and 3,000 families for each
survey, with the number varying depending on the product and customer
preferences.
Li's company, founded by a group of Chinese MBA graduates from the
EC-sponsored Beijing-based China European Management Institute, has six
full-time employees and conducts its business by interviewing distributors.
The company has dealt almost exclusively with foreign firms.
To many Chinese, accustomed to Soviet-style methods of collecting
information, this process of data collection is almost revolutionary.
The consumer response rate to market surveys is about 60 per cent, which is
high compared with the western equivalent, according to Yuan. 'People think
it's all so new,' Yuan said. 'They have never seen this before and they
think 'why are you asking me?''
Traditionally, reports sent to officials and directors have always told them
what they want to hear. They have never relied on a realistic appraisal of
the market or canvassing ordinary consumers.
This is still true among many state-run enterprises. 'Domestic Chinese
companies don't want us to assess the market,' said Connections' Li.
'They want us to write a report that must be favourable. We generally avoid
working for domestic companies.'
Obtaining accurate market surveys has become more critical as companies
become more profit-orientated. With many enterprises acquiring goods through
unofficial means (including smuggling) outside the central distribution
network, the compilation of official statistics about the breakdown of
market share can be inaccurate.
For example, a large demand for photocopiers has led to smuggling and a much
greater market for these machines than official data indicate, Li said.
He also noted that official statistics about the Chinese pharmaceutical
industry have a high error rate and do not reflect how foreign
pharmaceutical multi-nationals have begun to dominate the market.
For these reasons, growing numbers of private Chinese enterprises,
collectives and foreign companies are increasingly turning to organisations
such as Yuan's institute and Li's company to do business.
Even a few state-run enterprises are beginning to rely on western marketing
tools. In a centrally planned economy, most managers of state-run
organisations have never had a need to collect market data, or even to place
advertisements in the official media.
However, as state-run corporations face tougher competition from smaller,
more efficiently run joint ventures and private enterprises, that attitude
is slowly changing.
Yuan cites the experience of one state-owned Chinese leather goods
manufacturer in Beijing. A bestseller of leather accessories, the enterprise
never knew consumers' opinions about its products or even the percentage of
market share its goods occupied in the domestic market. The company relied
upon its sales force to keep it informed about new styles and trends in
China and abroad.
Still, Yuan believes the future lies with China's growing private sector.
His institute has surveyed about 1,000 private Chinese enterprises each with
assets worth about Yn1m (Pounds 114,000). Most of these enterprises are
based in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong and Fujian.
The conclusions he and his colleagues reached are revealing: nearly all of
the entrepreneurs interviewed believe the profits gained from running their
own businesses are worth the risks, but their greatest worry is still
political uncertainty.
Despite this concern, Yuan, a law graduate who previously worked at the
Ministry of Justice, plans to take advantage of the current hospitable
economic climate towards private enterprises by severing his ties with the
institute and going into the market research business with three other
investors this year.
If the can-do and risk-taking approach of men like Yuan and Li is any
indication, they are on the ground floor of what could be a booming
industry. 'In five years' time, the demand for marketing will be big,' Li
said. 'We are ahead of domestic demand.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hop across the
border - Bernard Simon considers a deal between Miller Brewing of the US and
Canada's Molson Breweries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wholesalers who distribute Miller beers in the US were given an unusual
message at their national sales convention in Orlando, Florida, last month.
Jack MacDonough, Miller Brewing's president, told them that the US's
second-biggest brewer was putting its muscle behind the hitherto-competing
brands of Canada's Molson Breweries.
MacDonough encouraged the wholesalers to do likewise by buying the Molson
distribution rights for their area. Miller and Molson had just signed a deal
which, if it works, could become a model for similar partnerships between
other consumer products companies.
One party, in this case Miller, is eager to broaden its product range
without the vast expense and risk of launching a new brand. The other,
Molson, has a promising product but lacks the resources to make a
significant dent in a large and unfamiliar foreign market.
'Everybody gets something great out of this,' enthuses John Carroll,
president of Molson Breweries, the joint venture formed in 1989 between
Canada's Molson Companies and Foster's Brewing of Australia.
Under the deal, which took effect last week, Miller has bought the US
marketing and distribution rights for Molson brands, the best-known of which
include Molson Golden, Molson Canadian and Foster's.
Miller will pay Molson a royalty on sales. The Milwaukee-based company has
not just committed itself to spending specific amounts of money to boost
Molson sales but is also contractually bound to achieve specific sales
targets. Both companies declined to reveal details, other than to say that
the marketing effort for Molson will be on a par with that for leading US
domestic brands.
As part of the deal, Miller has also become a partner in Molson's operations
outside the US. It has acquired a 20 per cent stake in Molson Breweries,
whose brands account for more than half the Canadian beer market. The two
companies expect their co-operation to extend to such areas as purchasing,
product development and brewery operations.
Miller, which is the brewing arm of Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and
drinks group, has long been regarded as the least aggressive of the leading
US brewers. But it is now the only one with a foothold in all three
countries which have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In its first investment outside the US, it acquired a minority stake late
last year in Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), one of Mexico's biggest
beverage companies. Molson's market share in the US is currently a minuscule
0.8 per cent.
But of the 400 imported beers sold in the US, Molson is second only to
Heineken. Its market share reaches double digits in such border cities as
Buffalo, New York and consumer research suggests it enjoys a much higher
awareness among drinkers than its market share indicates.
Miller's MacDonough says Molson is 'a terrific brand which has good growth
potential if resources are put behind it'.
Miller and Molson predict that US beer drinkers will be especially attracted
by Molson's Canadian roots, which evoke images of a cool, clean and
high-quality product.
'Over the next few years, we plan to build on the strengths that we've got
and to establish those strengths in other markets,' says John Barnett,
president of Molson USA, which is now a subsidiary of Miller.
Molson is encouraged by the early results of three test campaigns which it
launched last autumn in the New England states, Denver and Syracuse. Thanks
to new labels and packaging and lower prices, Molson says the boost in sales
so far has exceeded its expectations. Some of the increase appears to have
come at the expense of US domestic brands.
That raises the question whether any future gains made by Molson in the US
will eat into the market share of Miller beers. MacDonough acknowledges
there may be some cannibalism.
'When you expand the growth of Molson, that growth will come from domestic
brands, more than from imports,' he says. But with Miller's brands
accounting for 22 per cent of the market, he predicts 'it will impact the
competition more than it will impact us'.
The partnership also creates an awkward situation for Molson, which has the
Canadian licence to brew Coors, one of Miller's chief rivals.
Coors Light is among the most popular light beers in Canada and Molson is
anxious that its deal with Miller should not jeopardise the Coors
relationship. Miller has agreed that its representatives will not take part
in any discussions between Molson and Coors.
Molson beers are already available across the US but, in Barnett's words,
'just being there is not enough. It can be available because it's there, or
it can be actively promoted and advertised. In a country of this size,
there's an enormous difference between the two'.
Furthermore, he says that Miller's knowledge of the US marketplace will give
Molson access to 'significant ethnic markets that we have never really tried
to understand.'
With the Miller clout behind it, Molson expects that its beers will be
displayed more prominently in retail outlets, such as the valuable
end-of-aisle spots. It is also looking for Molson brands to be featured more
often in retailers' flyers, and other promotional material.
Within a day or two of the deal closing, MacDonough met Lintas, Molson's US
advertising agency, to discuss Miller's marketing strategy. Miller
salespeople who look after the accounts of big retail chains will in future
also promote Molson products.
For the time being, however, Miller and Molson will continue to have
separate sales teams calling on wholesale distributors.
The Canadians and Australians will be well satisfied if their link with
Miller boosts Molson's share of the US beer market to 2.5 per cent over the
next five years. That may seem a modest target, but it would triple Molson's
present market share, putting it far ahead of Heineken, its main competitor.
At that level, exports to the US would also equal half the total Canadian
market. The survival of Molson's breweries in Canada, now running well below
capacity and facing an inexorable decline in domestic beer consumption,
would be assured.

FT  08 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Meeting of minds fails to strike the
right balance - The gulf between academe and the profession revealed by a
key conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE British Accounting Association conference held this week is anything
to go by, the profession should be sadly shaking its head. As a slice
through the current state of academia, the omens from the UK's principal
annual research gathering held at Strathclyde University in Glasgow are not
good.
Both the focus and the quality of research seem to an outside observer to
leave much to be desired. While many academics criticise accountants for
creating a profession shrouded in mystique and self-interest, they are doing
exactly the same in their own work - with one important difference. Unlike
accountants in business or public practice, they have apparently no
'customers' to prevent them becoming smothered in self-absorption.
Karl Marx is certainly alive and well in accountancy departments across the
country. But he is also no doubt turning fast in those tombs at the thought
of those who have failed to move with the times, and who invoke his name
while failing to match both his level of analysis and his writing abilities.
'Calls for concomitant change in accountancy practice have been made from
perspectives if not entirely internal to the discipline then internal to a
dualistic ontology,' the abstract to one jargon-ridden and highly abstract
paper begins.
Education would not be fulfilling its purpose if it was entirely utilitarian
and vocational. A fascinating paper - unfortunately withdrawn at the last
minute - promised to reconstruct the fifteenth century accounts of the Cely
family, London wool and wheat merchants who diversified into shipping and
overseas trading.
The findings? The accounts were in some ways highly sophisticated, and
showed gross profits from shipping of 100 per cent against 10 per cent for
the domestic wool trade. No surprise that the shift in activity took place.
But stripped of the blubber of verbiage, too many of the academic papers and
presentations had little meat of original or interesting intellectual
content, let alone solid bone of theoretical framework or structure.
Those attending the conference stressed the importance of meeting colleagues
and carrying on work informally outside the seminars, and that many of the
papers were at an early stage. But as the principal academic meeting in the
UK each year, the output was disappointing.
Ironically, one of the better papers was given by two US academics, who
suggested that women accountants were more moral than their male
counterparts in the Big 6 firms.
Others looked at the accuracy of analysts' forecasts, studied the reasons
for changes in audit firms by companies and examined the effectiveness of
the government's reforms of the National Health Service.
Research in many academic subjects has no obvious ties to a profession.
Some, such as literature, have little scope for becoming directly 'relevant'
to the world outside universities. But what seems surprising is that in one
so young and so dependent on practitioners as accounting, there should be so
little dialogue.
Many of the academics betrayed ignorance or naivety of the profession if not
downright hostility. A good number seemed unable to even read a basic set of
accounts.
As one survey presented at the conference showed, most practitioners believe
accounting research is largely theoretical, with less concern on relevance
to practical problems. It lacks general application, and focuses on
multinationals more than small and medium-sized firms.
The mismatch works in both ways. The accountancy profession cannot escape
without some blame. It seems to be making little attempt to build bridges,
or learn from the more meaningful research. There was no sign of any
technical staff or partners from the larger firms at the conference, for
instance. The only outsiders to the 400-odd academics were a handful of
publishers. Aside from its sponsorship of a few academic posts - rather than
specific research projects - its role is negligible.
That is not to say that all the practical papers were of the greatest value.
One consumed 45 pages of regression analysis to find that the turnover of
newly-qualified accountants in the firms is determined by job satisfaction,
and commitment to the organisation and the profession.
Another provided a useful review of the status of audit committees around
the world, but finished with the hardly profound conclusion that: 'they are
not, and cannot be, the solution to all corporate ills'.
There is clearly a danger that, with funding pressures tightening, research
will be diverted too far to practical applications, or dressed uneasily in
empirical clothes. A large number of the papers presented in Glasgow used
surveys, but their sample sizes and hence reliability were risible: as low
as 18 in one case.
The university academics mutter that standards have fallen now that
polytechnics have been re-titled universities and that their lecturers,
recast as dons, are being required to undertake serious research for the
first time. But some of these papers do at least have relevance, reflecting
the vocational bent of the former polytechnics. One considered ways to make
accounting information friendly and useful to managers in business, for
instance.
A more valid reason for low quality may be that academic accounting is
fragmenting, with the more worthwhile research being presented at specialist
conferences away from the annual gathering.
Yet if there is better work being done elsewhere, there certainly seems to
be little attempt to disseminate the findings beyond abstruse technical
journals which circulate only to university departments and libraries. That
may be the best way to gain personal career advancement for academics, but
it does little good to society at large.
An interesting start to re-focusing attention outwards was made at this
year's conference in the form of a debate between politicians and
practitioners. (In the interests of full disclosure, take note that the
author of this column chaired the session).
Austin Mitchell, the labour MP who is making a second career from lambasting
accountants, continued his calls for an end to self-regulation, the
introduction of regular rotation of audit firms and a new companies act
which sets out auditors' duties to shareholders, including the detection of
fraud.
Stuart Bell, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, called for a US-style
Securities and Exchange Commission, the enshrinement of accounting and
auditing standards in European directives and the possibility of
German-style supervisory boards to oversee companies.
Primrose McCabe, senior vice-president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, asked for time to let the new mechanisms of
discipline and enforcement work, while conceding that auditors may have
given way to chief executives too easily during the 1980s.
Bill Morrison, deputy senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick and chairman of
the Auditing Practices Board, stressed the need for litigation protection
for auditors and for recognition of the role of professional expertise and
judgment in the audit rather than simply simplistic, dogmatic rules.
However accurate or misguided these views, they provide an illustration of
the some of the concerns vexing the profession. Perhaps academics should
take heed of them in determining their own research interests, and then be
sure to disseminate the findings widely. While most turn their backs on the
world off-campus, the risk is that an unrepresentative handful that do speak
up distort the image and reputation of the discipline.

FT  08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: Major's blue period - A year on from
success at the polls, the prime minister's popularity has plunged. He still
has a great deal to prove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by
winning the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory,
was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a
deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove.
The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over
Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates
mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep
recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory
supporters in business.
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political
point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,'
he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's efforts to
secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in
launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment
of Mr Major's failures. He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of
pre-election commitments'.
Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense
pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as
recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation
of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting
man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.'
Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among
industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been
Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over
which, in the end, he had no control.
Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an
individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal
qualities and those of his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude for the
election victory, which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the
economy - as the best result for business.
But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with
little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction.
There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place
in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with
community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment
of the domestic economy.
Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape
economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base. But the jury is out
on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action.

FT  08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: What industry says about him in the
boardroom - 'A committed European . . . a man with no vision . . . calm and
far-sighted . . . unable to promote a feeling of confidence . . .'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE months after most of the business community welcomed the unexpected
return of a Conservative government, company executives give their verdict
on the performance of Mr John Major. Mr David Thompson, managing director of
Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries:
'I give John Major a plus for sticking by Norman Lamont. I think the
cautious approach adopted in the Budget showed a realistic appreciation of
the situation.' Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods:
'His greatest strength is that he replaced Mrs Thatcher. His greatest
weakness is that he doesn't appear to have an intellectual reason for what
he's doing.' Mr Maurice Warren, chairman of Dalgety:
'He is a committed European. That is terribly important to British business.
His greatest weakness is not appearing as a strong leader. The tremendous
difficulties caused by the Maastricht rebels are creating a significant risk
for business by having Britain sit on the sidelines of Europe.'
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey:
'His greatest strengths have been his commitment to low inflation and his
willingness to listen to views from outside. Our concern is that he has so
far been unable to promote any general feeling of confidence.' Sir Allen
Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan:
'It's been an extremely tough year for the world economy. Throughout this
difficult period, the prime minister has shown himself to be remarkably calm
and far-sighted.'
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation:
'His greatest strength is his willingness to listen to manufacturing
industry and to accept that manufacturing holds the key to this country's
economic success. His weakness is not persuading enough of his cabinet
colleagues of the need for this country to have an industrial strategy.'
Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Lancer Boss:
'John Major will be proved to be one of the best overall prime ministers. He
has a good economic policy and has stood up well to critics. The best thing
John Major has done is to pull out of the ERM.'
Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive of ICL:
'What we need from Major are stable government policies and a stable
currency in addition to low inflation. Add to that a successful conclusion
to the Gatt talks and to the Maastricht debate.'
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons:
'He is approachable, resistant to pressure, and determined. The best thing
he has done is to win the election.' Mr Ken Morrison, chairman of Wm
Morrison:
'I'd like to see him do anything that makes us more competitive. We seem to
have lost the edge.'
Mr Trevor Osborne of Speyhawk, technically insolvent property company:
'He appears to listen. His weakness is that he has failed sufficiently to
identify a vision and articulate it to the nation.'
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive of Royal Insurance:
'He is a straightforward guy. Realistic not dogmatic. The single most
important thing he has done for business is relieved us of the constraints
of the ERM.'
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot:
'Through all the country's difficulties I've never heard anyone describe him
as other than someone who displays kindness, consideration and who treats
people properly.'

IF IT has been a tough year for Mr John Major, it has hardly been one long

He has been working up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week, to keep his
one-man business alive, and seems, possibly like the prime minister, a
little surprised to have survived. Mr Millington, an engraver by profession
and Liverpudlian by birth, owns Adams Engraving in Woking. He bought it 18
months ago as the economy slid deeper into recession. He had applied for the
job of manager but put his house on the line to buy the business: 'Everyone
thought I was crazy,' he recalls.
The company, which specialises in engraving everything from golf club
trophies to aero-engine components, had a small base of regular customers
and turnover of Pounds 35,000 a year. Now, in spite of weak demand, a long
period of high interest rates and rising raw material prices, Mr Millington
has pushed turnover to about Pounds 68,000. It should reach Pounds 80,000
this year and the plan is start recruiting by Christmas.
But Mr Major has not made life any easier for the small enterprises they
claim to champion, says Mr Millington. Britain's departure from the exchange
rate mechanism meant a sharp rise in the cost of German-made brass and he
has been unable to pass on the increase to customers.
He also paints a familiar picture of bureaucratic interference and
commercial ignorance among officials.
'They constantly claim they are banishing red tape but I have yet to see any
evidence. People are urged to take up their redundancy pay and have a go for
themselves, but the environment for small businesses is still hostile. The
VAT people can be vicious and now we are awaiting our first visit from the
Inland Revenue. Now I have to implement a quality standard which is going to
cost me thousands and take two years. Where is the understanding?' He says
Mr Major's greatest strength is his negotiating ability, as demonstrated in
Europe, but he wants him to pay more attention to the nation's domestic
problems.
'We need stronger leadership. People need encouragement and the confidence
to go out and set up the small engineering shops which will help restore the
manufacturing skills we have been losing. The priority must be for big
capital projects which will work through to the benefit of everyone down the
chain.'
This holiday weekend, Mr Millington and his wife, Barbara, who keeps the
books, will take a well-earned break from the daily struggle. He regularly
asks himself if it is worth the effort: 'I suppose being your own boss still
means the answer is yes.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Portrait fetches Pounds 551,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY double portrait by leading 18th-century Scottish painter Allan
Ramsay doubled its estimate to fetch an auction record price of Pounds
551,500 at Christie's in London yesterday.
Yesterday's price is in line with other portraits by Ramsay recently
acquired for the nation by private treaty sale and now in the Tate Gallery
in London and the National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.
The three-quarter-length portrait marks the marriage of Sir Edward and Lady
Turner and the launch of Ramsay's highly successful career in London.
Another portrait, Sir Thomas Lawrence's half-length of Miss Juliana Copley,
also exceeded expectations, selling for Pounds 102,700.
The sale of British pictures realised Pounds 1,744,560 with 71 per cent sold
by value.

FT  08 APR 93 / ITV lifts network budget to Pounds 540m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies have agreed a total national network budget for 1994 of
Pounds 540m, an increase of Pounds 25m on the current year.
The budget, which includes the cost of ITN's news programmes, was at the
upper end of expectations.
In spite of a widening gap between the resources of the ITV companies, some
of which bid considerably more for their franchises, all agreed to put up
their share - in proportion to their net advertising revenues - after only
two meetings and no fundamental disagreements.
The latest ratings, for the week to March 28, show that ITV won a 41 per
cent share of the audience compared with 32.5 per cent for BBC 1 and a total
of 42.2 per cent for both BBC channels. Channel 4 had 11.2 per cent.
Advertising revenues are improving and advertising agencies forecast net
revenues for all commercial TV broadcasters of Pounds 1.89bn for 1993
(Pounds 1.84bn at 1992 prices), compared with an expected total of just
under Pounds 1.8bn for 1992.
National Economic Research Associates, an economic consultancy, recorded in
its March survey of leading advertising agencies an improvement in
confidence for the fifth successive month.

FT  08 APR 93 / Windfarm proposal submitted to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPLICATION for permission to build Europe's biggest windfarm on the
western edge of the Kielder forest in Northumberland was lodged yesterday
with the Department of Trade and Industry by TriGen Windpower, a joint
venture between UK, US and Japanese companies.
The proposed Pounds 80m windfarm would comprise more than 250 wind turbines,
each 170ft high, with the capacity to feed up to 80 megawatts into the
national grid. Power stations of 50MW or above are the planning
responsibility of the DTI, rather than local authorities.
The three square mile site, believed by TriGen to be the windiest in
England, is 1,500ft above sea level, and is owned by Forest Enterprise, the
Forestry Commission's estate management arm.
TriGen expects average output to be between 20MW and 30MW. The electricity
would go on power lines to a substation at the Royal Air Force's Spadeadam
base in Cumbria.
The project needs planning permission as well as a subsidy under the UK
government's non-fossil fuel obligation scheme, which requires electricity
companies to buy some energy generated from renewable sources.
TriGen Windpower intends to bid for subsidy in the next tranche of schemes,
expected later this year. It hopes to have the windfarm operational by the
end of 1995.

FT  08 APR 93 / Birt to meet all 23,000 staff on BBC's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, BBC director-general, is pushing ahead with an ambitious and
costly scheme to invite all 23,000 staff to one-day discussions about the
future of the corporation.
Staff will come from BBC offices throughout the UK to sessions in London.
The former Radio Times offices in Marylebone High Street will be refurbished
at a cost of more than Pounds 3m for the purpose.
The refurbished premises will also be able to be used for general training.
The sessions for small groups of employees are expected to begin in June and
will be held on every working day until next spring. Apart from discussions
there will be video presentations.
Mr Birt will appear personally for at least part of each day's session so
that over the course of the year he will be able to meet all the BBC staff.
The sessions are designed to cover everything from the principles behind
Extending Choice, the BBC's policy for the future, to Producer Choice, the
controversial system of giving producers the right to buy services on the
open market.
The plan for the discussion sessions was mentioned briefly on January 11
when Mr Birt outlined his policy for the future but was hardly noticed at
the time. In fact planning for the unprecedented exercise had already begun.
Advertisements for staff to run the operation appeared in this week's Ariel,
the BBC's house magazine. The advertisements are for 'facilitors' who will
help with the discussions and for members of a support team.
The support team will provide 'active professional support on presenters and
facilitators, handling efficiently the complex logistics inherent in making
these days happen'.
The support team contracts are for one year.
Previous director-generals have set out to meet as many BBC staff as
possible and explain their policies but they have done so by going to the
staff rather than bringing staff to them.
One of the important principles behind Extending Choice was to create a more
efficient and accountable BBC.
The BBC says it looked at the possibility of taking the discussion sessions
to the regions but decided it would be more effective to have them at one
site in London.
Last month Mr Birt survived calls for his resignation after it was
discovered that throughout his time as deputy director-general he had not
been on the BBC staff.
Instead he had been a free-lance consultant whose services were contracted
through his private company John Birt Productions.
Mr Birt is now on the staff of the BBC.

FT  08 APR 93 / Insurer opposes disclosure plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, the UK's second-largest mutual life insurer, yesterday
signalled that it may oppose the Office of Fair Trading's proposal that
independent financial advisers should reveal their commissions in cash
terms.
At the announcement of Norwich Union's annual results, Mr Allan Bridgewater,
group chief executive, and chairman-elect of the Association of British
Insurers, said: 'We are seeking positively to find ways of reacting to the
report. What we are not supportive of is that there should be one particular
professional distribution channel singled out for extra publication without
some examination of the level playing field implications.'
However, he echoed the views of Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the
Prudential, by voicing broad support for the Office of Fair Trading's
proposals. He said: 'We take the view that the consumer is entitled to
understand the nature of the contracts which he or she is buying.'
Norwich Union also voiced concern about increasing motor and domestic crime.
Higher crime levels have led to higher insurance premiums.
Mr Bridgewater said that it was necessary to combat 'the decline in social
and moral values so premiums can reflect a more ordered and self-disciplined
society'.

TRANSMARK, British Rail's international consultancy business, has been sold
for about Pounds 5m to Halcrow, the engineering consultants, as part of the
privatisation of BR's non-core businesses.
Transmark, which has worked on more than 200 rail projects in 30 countries,
made an operating surplus of Pounds 1.1m on a turnover of Pounds 10m in its
last financial year.
Halcrow said that Transmark's background in rail operation and design would
complement its own engi-neering and transportation skills.
After the acquisition Halcrow will have a staff of more than 2,000 people
generating an annual turnover of Pounds 90m. It operates in 70 countries
with about 80 per cent of its sales overseas.

FT  08 APR 93 / Warning over rise in number of pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL pressures of an increasingly elderly population could cause
conflict between the generations, the final report of a study of the lives
and needs of older people warns today.
The number of pensioners will peak around the year 2030 and impose heavy
costs on people of working age, the report says.
Older people taking on more paid work may be the best way to ease the
problem, which it says will be worsened by the shift to earlier retirement.
The report is the culmination of a series of studies into the third age  -
defined as between 50 and 74 - financed by the Carnegie UK Trust and
conducted by a range of research organisations. The findings will be used to
launch a public debate about third-age issues later this month.
By 2031, says the report, Britain will have 46 pensioners for every 100
people of working age compared with the present figure of 30. While it was
understandable that younger people were given priority for jobs at times of
high unemployment, it was 'in the interests of everyone that older people
were enabled and encouraged to work'.
The report calls for older people to receive better access to training and
skilled paid work. Age discrimination should be eliminated where possible.
'Training, both on the job and for the unemployed, needs to be substantially
increased so that over-50s can be given as much access to it as younger
people.'
Third-agers' potential could be achieved only when lifelong education,
training and access to information were the norm. Britain, says the report,
is 'a long way from achieving this'.
It calls for a new independent body to monitor third-age issues at national
level, and urges the government to address the future of the state
retirement pension.
The present policy of increasing the basic pension in line with prices
rather than earnings is gradually eroding its role in maintaining living
standards of pensioners, says the report.
'The basic state pension is enormously expensive because it goes to nearly
everyone, and if its costs were reduced it would be possible to spend more
on means-tested support for the poorest.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Employers face EC curbs on ability to cut pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS' ability to reduce pay and conditions at short notice will be
seriously impaired by a little-noticed clause the European Commission has
forced the government to insert into the Trade Union Reform and Employment
Rights Bill, employers' organisations said yesterday.
At present employers can generally give a few days' notice of terminating an
existing employment contract, after which employees are technically
dismissed and then offered re-employment on less favourable terms.
During the recession many employers have been making, or trying to make,
such changes, most notably Rolls-Royce in 1991. Sometimes employees accept
the new terms but they are often resisted and, if employers are judged to
have introduced the changes unfairly, employees can win damages at an
industrial tribunal.
But a clause in the Employment Rights Bill, designed to bring British law
fully into line with the EC's Collective Redundancies directive and due to
become law this summer, means that employers are likely to have to give 90
days' notice in the case of such technical dismissals.
Previously the directive insisted on 90 days' notice only for ordinary
redundancies where 100 or more employees were losing their jobs. The
Employment Rights Bill introduces a more broad definition of redundancy to
include 'dismissal for a reason not related to the individual concerned'.
The Institute of Directors said it was 'concerned' about the effects of the
change. 'We made representations to the government about this but they said
there was no problem,' it said.
A TUC official welcomed the change, saying it brought British law into line
with the original directive. Other changes include the obligation on
employers to 'seek to reach agreement with trade union representatives' on
redundancies.
The commission had been threatening legal action against Britain if it did
not incorporate these points. Legal action may continue over the fact that
in Britain consultation over redundancies is required only where unions are
recognised.

FT  08 APR 93 / Flagging oil sector at odds over tax changes: Fears over the
future of exploration dilute the welcome given to the regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO projects announced separately by Shell and British Petroleum in the past
week will inject close to Pounds 2bn into the North Sea over the next five
years. This is a shot in the arm for the flagging oil sector, which is
suffering from persistently low oil prices.
They are the type of projects the chancellor intended to encourage when he
announced changes to petroleum revenue tax rules in the Budget. Both
projects stand to benefit from the tax changes - some analysts reckon the
new rules have added Pounds 100m to the value of BP's Forth field, which it
announced it would develop last Friday.
In addition, the lower tax rate will give Shell an added incentive to go
ahead with the extensive plans it revealed on Tuesday to extend the life of
its Brent field.
But both projects were planned long before the tax changes and would
probably have gone ahead anyway. Because of the long lead times required for
large investment decisions in the North Sea, many oil companies fear the
full effects of the changes will not be evident for many years. By that
time, they argue, exploration will dwindle and it will be too late to entice
it back by changing the rules again.
The new rules lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent
to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove
tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea which will hit
many of the small independent companies hardest.
The Treasury estimates that the rule changes will raise Pounds 700m over
three years. But this forecast has been challenged by Wood MacKenzie, the
Edinburgh-based industry analyst, which estimates the revenue increase to be
Pounds 115m over the same period.
The industry agrees that the tax changes will quadruple the cost of
exploring in the North Sea and this has caused an outcry in the oil
industry. But the new rules have also led to a row between companies that
stand to gain from the proposals and those that will lose.
British Petroleum is one of the winners. Wood MacKenzie reckons that the new
rules will improve its cashflow by Pounds 412m or 14 per cent over three
years. Companies such as Amerada Hess stand to lose the most  - an estimated
Pounds 83m or 10 per cent knocked off its cashflow until 1996, according to
Wood MacKenzie.
The split between winners and losers has made it very difficult for the
industry to formulate a joint response to the government's proposals and
this has undoubtedly weakened its case. The Treasury sees little
justification for making changes to the new rules.
But there is one issue that has united the industry - the retrospective
nature of the tax changes. Companies applying for acreage to drill in the
North Sea must make presentations to the Department of Trade and Industry in
which they sketch out their plans for exploration. As part of this they will
agree to drill a certain number of wells over a specific period of time.
'We make these commitments in good faith that the rules at the time will
stay in place,' said Mr David Keith, managing director of Seafield
Resources, one of the smaller UK exploration companies.
Companies are calling either for a transition period during which tax relief
will still apply to wells they are committed to or to be released from the
obligations made under previous licensing rounds. Under the present
arrangements, if companies do not drill the wells to which they are
committed, the government can take away their exploration licences.
The DTI has yet to respond, but it has sent a letter to companies asking if
they want to revise their bids made for the 14th licensing round, the
results of which are due to be announced in a couple of months.
It is the independent oil sector that will be most severely affected by the
new rules and many say they are looking to move much of their exploration
effort overseas.
Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director of British Borneo, one of the small UK
exploration companies, sums it up: 'This will greatly curtail future
exploration activity which is needed to find the next generation of new
fields. It will decimate the drilling contractors and in the long run, will
shut down much of the North Sea much sooner than we would have expected.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Legal aid restrictions to go ahead: Law Society wins leave
to challenge Mackay's move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MACKAY, the lord chancellor, is to go ahead with cuts in legal aid
eligibility from next week in spite of a High Court ruling yesterday
allowing the Law Society to challenge the validity of his proposals.
The solicitors' governing body was granted leave to seek a judicial review
of the lord chancellor's plans after Lord Mackay decided not to oppose its
application. Mr Justice Macpherson said the case should be heard as soon as
possible in view of the 'enormous public interest'. The hearing is expected
to take place at the end of May.
Mr Michael Beloff QC, for the society, told the judge both sides had reached
'a combined view' that the issues raised by the case should be argued at a
full High Court hearing.
He said that 'in the circumstances' the society would not be applying for a
court order suspending the changes - due to come into force on day - until
after the legal challenge had been concluded.
The society maintains that the changes, which will reduce the qualifying
disposable income limit for free legal aid to income-support levels and
increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases, could affect
up to 14m people in England and Wales.
Lord Mackay has dismissed those figures as 'absurd'. He maintains that in
practical terms about 120,000 of the 3m people who receive financial
assistance from the scheme each year would be affected.
After yesterday's hearing the Lord Chancellor's Department said the
challenge would be 'strongly opposed'.
It added: 'In the meantime the lord chancellor does not propose to delay the
April 12 implementation of the regulations, which were debated and approved
in the House of Commons on March 31.'
It was 'administratively too difficult' to withdraw the regulations at this
stage, it said. If they were eventually ruled unlawful only a few people
would have been affected in the weeks they were in force.
Mr Mark Sheldon, the society's president, last night wrote to Lord Mackay
urging him to think again and suspend the regulations.
'If the regulations come into force on April 12, many people who have an
urgent need for legal advice - perhaps to avoid eviction or to obtain an
injunction in a domestic violence case - will be irreparably prejudiced,
whatever the court's final decision,' he said.
This is the second time in a month that the society has won permission to
challenge the legal aid proposals.
In March the same judge gave the society leave to seek a judicial review of
the lord chancellor's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal
aid work in magistrates' courts. That challenge will be heard on April 29.
In both cases the society alleges that Lord Mackay has acted outside his
powers under the 1988 Legal Aid Act.
The society claims his proposals on standard fees for criminal work are
contrary to the principle set out in the act that a solicitor is entitled to
'fair remuneration' for a case.
In the latest case the society says the regulations were made without proper
consultation as required by the act.

FT  08 APR 93 / Council tax 'will benefit two thirds of households'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor and RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO THIRDS of households will pay less under the council tax this year than
they paid last year under the poll tax, according to the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, a social policy think tank.
An institute report published today says that the new tax will bring
greatest benefit to the lowest-income households. People who can afford
high-value homes and single-person households will lose most.
The structure of the tax contributes to the number of gainers, the institute
says.
Other factors include the 6 per cent fall in the amount to be collected by
the council tax and the government's transitional relief scheme to limit
increases over poll tax levels.
Nearly 65 per cent of councils are raising less in local taxation in 1993-94
than in 1992-93.
Almost half of all households will gain more than Pounds 50 a year from the
introduction of the council tax, the report finds. The biggest gainers are
the unemployed, who will get 100 per cent rebates on their council tax,
compared with a maximum poll tax rebate of 80 per cent.
The poorest 30 per cent of households gain the most from the change on
average, according to the report. People with homes in valuation bands A to
D (worth less than Pounds 88,000 in England) are also net gainers.
The council tax is regressive in its overall impact: the rich pay a smaller
percentage of their income than middle-income earners. However, it is less
regressive than the poll tax, mainly because the benefit system has become
more generous.
The tax also redistributes the burden between different regions. Bills have
increased substantially in London and the south-east, the report says. The
north, north-west, east Midlands and west Midlands are substantial gainers.
The feared avalanche of appeals against council tax valuations has so far
failed to materialise, writes Rhodri Davies.
Ministers had made provision for council tax offices to handle about 1m
appeals between April 1 and November 30. It was assumed that there would be
widespread protests over a tax which places each house in one of eight
property bands.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation had suggested that council
offices had been flooded with up to 1.2m inquiries - almost 10 per cent of
property owners. But revised Inland Revenue estimates say there had been
about 410,000 queries, of which less than 60 per cent were thought to be
potential appellants.
The impact of the tax has been cushioned by the government's Pounds 340m
transitional relief package and by some 200,000 changes to the draft
valuations, recommended by councils to the listings officers before the tax
was introduced.
But many householders have yet to receive the new tax bills, and many of
those who ignored the notice of valuation they received from their council
may react once they see the bill.

FT  08 APR 93 / Salvation Army to break silence on missing Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Salvation Army is preparing to break its silence on the circumstances
surrounding an alleged Pounds 6m fraud by publishing an interim report on
the affair.
The charity has refused to comment on the alleged fraud since it surfaced on
February 15 when a writ was issued in the High Court. The writ alleged that
Tilen Securities Inc and Birmingham businessman Mr Stuart Ford and Mr Gamil
Naguib conspired to defraud the charity of the money.
The charity has maintained that it had to balance the public's right to know
the facts with the need to recover the missing money. It was advised by its
lawyers that to make any statements would jeopardise that recovery.
Senior charity officials now appear to be responding to internal pressure to
clarify what, if any, are the charity's own responsibilities in the matter
although only a small proportion of the missing money has been recovered.
In two weeks the charity's High Council of senior representatives from the
its various 'territories' meet to elect the new head or 'general' of the
organisation. The present general, Ms Eva Burroughs, has reached the end of
her five-year term.
It is felt that the incoming general should take up the post without the
affair remaining unresolved.
The Salvation Army last night confirmed that it planned to make an interim
statement shortly following meetings with its lawyers and Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the accountancy firm which has been investigating the alleged fraud for the
charity.
The statement may shed some light on the future of Colonel Grenville Burn,
who was in charge of the charity's fundraising and was involved in contacts
between the charity and Mr Naguib and Mr Ford. Col Burn has been officially
on sick leave since writs were issued and refused to comment last night.

FT  08 APR 93 / Major's vision of an end to the Ulster troubles: An
initiative by the PM for round-table talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEREAS others can only see fog, centuries-old problems and irreconcilable
differences, Mr John Major had a grandiose vision yesterday on his tour of
Northern Ireland.
'I believe the way ahead is clearer than many people may imagine,' he said.
Everybody in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and in Britain wants
peace, he said. Ipso facto, round-table talks on the province should resume
as soon as possible. He may have been naive but the immediate effect of his
speech was, on balance, positive. Talks will probably start after next
month's local elections in the province - only the Rev Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party appeared unhappy with that prospect last night.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may meet Unionist and
nationalist leaders beforehand in order to pre-empt disputes over procedural
points.
But the government's only fresh contribution to breaking the political
deadlock that has gripped the province since the 'troubles' started nearly
25 years ago was in one line at the end of Mr Major's speech: 'When they
talk, we will put proposals before the participants. We must press ahead.'
There were no official clues about what such government proposals might
involve. But indications from Whitehall are that the package will be a
synthesis of ideas already discussed by Unionist and nationalist parties
during previous talks that ended in November, rather than a fresh approach.
If Mr Major is to do more than act as a catalyst to talks that end, once
more, in failure, the government's proposals will almost certainly have to
bridge a divide that has stymied a trail of government initiatives over the
past two decades. Any signs that Mr Major has found a magic formula that has
proved elusive before are scant.
As suspicious as ever of the UK government giving ground to the
nationalists, Mr Paisley, yesterday castigated Mr Major for suggesting there
was a political solution to terrorism. He wants tougher security and an end
to the Irish Republic's constitutional claim on the north that gives
'oxygen' to the republican paramilitaries.
More subtly, more moderate Ulster Unionist MPs were urging that Northern
Ireland be treated like any other part of the UK - code for excluding the
Irish Republic from any practical involvement.
In contrast, Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, wants Northern Ireland's political machinery
set firmly in an all-Ireland context. Such complexities could emerge in
discussions on how talks resume. Unionists want low-key bilateral talks
focused on restoring democracy to the province and attach priority to Dublin
giving way on its constitutional claims.
The SDLP will want assurances that there will not be interim agreement on
any proposals until the whole agenda has been resolved - including Northern
Ireland's position within the British Isles.
Building on public revulsion at recent terrorist atrocities, Mr Major
appeared to have won enough goodwill to ensure such obstacles to talks will
be overcome. But it will only be a return to where the politicians were last
November.

FT  08 APR 93 / Lloyd's shakes up export credit cover market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS at Lloyd's of London are to increase their involvement in the
export credit insurance market following the relaxation of restrictions
imposed in the 1920s. Competition in the market, which has been dominated by
insurance companies, is expected to increase as a result of the move.
Lloyd's syndicates have been allowed to underwrite the risk of publicly
owned companies failing to pay exporters for goods received, but had been
excluded from the mainstream private-sector market.
Hiscox syndicate 33 was given permission by a committee of the
self-regulating Lloyd's market to set up an export credit insurance facility
backed by other Lloyd's syndicates last month.
Its underwriter Mr Geoffrey Lynch said: 'I was allowed to cover possible
default by a South American state-owned oil company but not that of the
likes of Exxon. It just didn't make sense for Lloyd's to turn its back on
the market.'
Mr Charles Berry, of brokers Berry Palmer &amp; Lyle, said that the restriction,
imposed after heavy losses by a Lloyd's underwriter who insured financial
guarantees, was outdated. He said: 'The outside world recognises that trade
credit risks are lower than some of the risks that syndicates are allowed to
underwrite.'
The facility will be carefully controlled to limit the risk to Names - the
individuals whose assets support Lloyd's - with no syndicate allowed to
receive more than 2 per cent of its premium income from the facility.
Mr Nigel Bovingdon, of Credit Insurance Association, a Hogg group subsidiary
which brokers about 25 per cent of UK export credit risks, said that Lloyd's
was 'breaking the mould' by opening the facility. He said Lloyd's would
provide extra competition for Trade Indemnity and the Dutch-owned NCM, which
dominate the market.
Lloyd's could also benefit from increased demand for export credit cover in
France and Germany, where Credit Insurance Association has recently opened
offices.
Meanwhile the Lloyd's leaders met yesterday to continue work on the business
plan, which could be presented to the council, the market's ruling body, as
early as next week.
The plan will outline a number of reforms designed to restore prosperity to
the market, where losses over the past five years are expected to exceed
Pounds 5bn.
The Society of Names, one of a number of groups representing lossmaking
Names, wrote to its members last week detailing a number of the measures
which it believes the plan will advocate.
Among these are moves to transfer 'long-tail' liabilities - those on which
claims emerge many years after the original inception of the policy to a new
centralised 'run-off' company.

FT  08 APR 93 / Crisis talks held to avert rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is holding separate talks today with the two main rail unions
in an attempt to prevent the second 24-hour strike on the network which is
due to take place on Friday next week.
Mr Paul Watkinson, British Rail's personnel director, said last night the
corporation could not afford any more damaging disruption on the railway
network. Last Friday's stoppage cost British Rail Pounds 10m in lost fare
income.
The meetings scheduled for today follow an announcement yesterday by Aslef,
the train drivers' union, that it intends to join the 24-hour stoppage
planned by the RMT, the main rail union, for April 16 in protest at the
threat of compulsory redundancies.
British Rail said in its invitation to the rail unions for talks that it
wanted to 'clarify' the problems. But the RMT said last night that it was
going into the discussions with the intention of 'negotiating positively and
constructively'.
Some 67 per cent of Aslef members voted in a postal ballot by 55 per cent to
45 per cent to support a one-day stoppage followed by a rolling programme of
industrial action.
At the moment, the prospect of an early settlement of the disputes with both
Aslef and the RMT looks remote. Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef's general
secretary, said yesterday that British Rail must honour existing national
agreements that cover job security, and added that he was not convinced by
British Rail's present assurances.
The RMT wants British Rail to accept there should be no future compulsory
redundancies and to agree to a ban on contract work. So far British Rail has
said it could not agree to these demands.
If today's talks fail to achieve a breakthrough British Rail may be forced
to adopt tougher tactics than it has done so far.
Some senior managers are in favour of confronting the rail unions, but so
far British Rail has adopted a conciliatory approach.

FT  08 APR 93 / Patten calls for shift on industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS Patten, the Hong Kong governor and former Tory party chairman,
yesterday said Britain had to 'play to its strengths' and concentrate on
promoting advanced industries - including financial and other services.
He said he did not want to 'downgrade manufacturing' because success
depended on staying ahead of the competition and upgrading industries, but
'no one should want people in Europe or north America to be locked into
tough manual or repetitive jobs', he said.
In a rare intervention in British political debate since his appointment to
the Hong Kong post a year ago, Mr Patten warned that the 'comparative
advantages' of western industrialised economies will tend in the future to
be man-made. He added: 'They will - above all - be determined by training
and education.'
Mr Patten's speech to a Tory Reform Group meeting in London did not clash
with recent calls by Mr John Major for a greater emphasis on promoting
manufacturing. But Mr Patten said: 'It plainly makes sense for the highly
industrialised economies to concentrate on the higher-value-added industries
including financial and other services.'
The government was right to reject the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty and argue for free trade, he said.

FT  08 APR 93 / 'Bored' junior auditors take short cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUNIOR AUDITORS take short cuts in their work while older tax accountants
tend to sympathise more with the Inland Revenue than their clients,
according to two academic papers circulated yesterday at the British
Accounting Association annual conference in Glasgow.
Only 22 per cent of a sample of 112 newly qualified accountants had not
indulged in 'irregular audit practices', Ms Caroline Willett and Mr Michael
Page of the University of Portsmouth said.
As a result of time pressure, more than half of the respondents said they
had been tempted to reject awkward-looking items from an audit sample, and a
quarter were tempted to accept audit evidence about which they were
doubtful. A total of 30 per cent had been tempted to hasten audit testing
because they believed the work was boring and 41 per cent because they
thought it was unimportant.
The findings, if they are representative, may cause embarrassment to
accountancy firms but some academics at the conference criticised the
research methods used. The researchers were accused of asking leading
questions.
In a separate study, researchers from the University of Bradford said that
taxpayers who were looking for a tax adviser sympathetic to their burdens
should seek out someone young, professionally qualified and practising in a
firm with no fewer than three partners.
The study found that decisions taken by advisers depended on factors such as
age and formal training, as well as technical knowledge of the tax system
and interpretation of tax law.
Based on a survey of 113 practitioners, the researchers concluded that most
had a high standard of morality over the issue of taxpayers withholding
information.
A third said they would inform only the client if information had been
deliberately withheld. Two thirds said they would also inform the Inland
Revenue. But the proportion who would contact the Revenue rose from 31 per
cent for those aged up to 35, to 83 per cent for those older than 50.

FT  08 APR 93 / Staff shares 'help attitude'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT increase in the number of employee share schemes over the past
decade has helped improve workers' attitudes towards work, although they
might not be working any harder, a report in today's Employment Gazette, the
journal of the Department of Employment, says.
Drawing on a survey jointly commissioned by the department, the Inland
Revenue and the Treasury, the report says schemes are more common in the
finance, banking, insurance and business services sectors.
'An important part of the explanation for this is that awareness of tax
advantages and financial matters in general tends to be higher in these
sectors,' says the report.
Schemes, particularly Save As You Earn schemes, were also more prevalent in
large quoted companies, the report adds.
Employee involvement was the most important effect sought by companies that
introduced share schemes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BALLOT for the position of general secretary of the Association of
University Teachers may have to be re-run after the question of technical
irregularities was raised in the way elections were held last year.
Mr David Triesman, who was narrowly elected to the job in December, said
last night that the AUT 'must plainly consider re-running the election' if
it could be shown there had been irregularities. However, a new ballot would
be 'a regrettable distraction' for the union, he said.

FT  08 APR 93 / Coal pension move defended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL's chairman has defended its plans to claim half of the
corporation's Pounds 1bn pension fund surplus.
Mr Neil Clarke, in a letter published in The Times today, says there is 'no
question of BC 'raiding' the fund', and stresses that members would gain
'substantial additional benefits'.
Critics have claimed that the government is using the pension fund surplus
to finance the Pounds 500m subsidy to the industry, and pension fund
trustees have challenged the move.
Mr Clarke admits that the claim on the fund was inspired by the government,
and says British Coal's legal advice was that it was allowed. But, he says,
the corporation intends to seek a High Court ruling on its legality as soon
as possible.
At issue is Pounds 481m of outstanding staged payments to the fund to cover
the cost of early retirements. The bulk was due to be refunded to British
Coal by the government.
On Monday British Coal suspended a Pounds 109m payment on which an Pounds
82m rebate was due.
In his letter Mr Clarke says the pension fund has a surplus of more than
Pounds 1 billion. Under the rules the corporation and fund members are
entitled to split any surplus, after a 'prudent allocation for reserves' and
provision for rises in the cost of living.
Mr Clarke says: 'The surplus will result in substantial additional benefits
to contributing members, by extending the number of years they are deemed to
have contributed, and in enhanced payments to pensioners.'
British Coal last night said there was no connection between the
government's subsidy to the coal industry and the pension fund payments.
'There's been a deliberate confusion by one or two trade unionists and
politicians,' it said.

FT  08 APR 93 / Audit letters need improvement, accounting conference
recommends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LETTERS issued by auditing firms to companies as part of the annual audit
are repetitious and could be considerably improved, a study at the
conference showed yesterday.
Eighty-four per cent of a sample of 120 companies received letters after the
annual audit and 37 per cent after an interim, research by Mr Sean
McCartney, Mr Stuart Manson and Mr Michael Sherer from the University of
Essex found.
Two thirds of the letters dealt with accounting methods and policies, 45 per
cent with taxation and 43 per cent with general business advice.
But managements generally said that the letters were of moderate value, and
58 per cent said they could be improved. Half of the respondents said at
least two fifths of the content of the letter repeated advice that had
already been given.
Nearly three quarters of companies had implemented at least 60 per cent of
the recommendations made on internal control and accounting systems,
accounting methods and taxation.
The accuracy of analysts' forecasts varies significantly between different
countries, with greater reliability in the UK and the US than in Germany,
France and Japan, the conference was told by Mr Eamonn Walsh of New York
University.

FT  08 APR 93 / National Trust wins action over Pounds 20m fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Trust yesterday won a High Court action against a building
contractor over the fire in which 17th century Uppark House, West Sussex,
was gutted in August 1989 when two workmen using an oxyacetylene torch on
the roof went for a tea break.
The workmen's employer, Haden Young, of Southgate, north London - part of
the BICC group - admitted that the fire was caused by its negligence but
denied liability for the restoration costs, which may run to Pounds 20m.
Haden Young said that under the terms of contracts between itself, the trust
and the main contractors - Midhurst and Fernhurst Builders - the trust was
to bear the risk of loss and damage by fire.
Mr Justice Otton said the contractual arrangements did not excuse Haden
Young from the consequences of its negligence.
He adjourned the assessment of damages, which are to be decided by a High
Court official, and ordered Haden Young to pay the trust's costs.
The trust's contract with Midhurst and Fernhurst had not provided for the
trust to bear the fire risk, he said.
Haden Young had not contracted with Midhurst and Fernhurst on the basis that
the trust should bear that risk, and the trust had not agreed to insure
anything for the benefit of Haden Young.

FT  08 APR 93 / Hope raised for fraud trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD TRIALS should be shorter and juries better informed after the Court of
Appeal judgment that the Serious Fraud Office can use all information given
to company liquidators under compulsion as evidence in court, an appeal
court judge said yesterday.
Three appeal judges gave their reasons behind the judgment, delivered last
month, that the SFO could have full access to transcripts of interviews
carried out by administrators using their powers under the Insolvency Act to
compel interviewees to answer questions. The SFO can use this information
freely as evidence in court, they ruled.
The issue had been taken to appeal by Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Larry
Trachtenberg and Mr Muhammed Naviede, head of the Arrows group, who all face
fraud charges brought by the SFO. All three have also been interviewed by
administrators using Insolvency Act powers.
The judges said the Insolvency Act 1986 did not limit provisions in the
Criminal Justice Act 1987, which established the SFO. They also rejected
arguments by Robson Rhodes, the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, and from administrators of other Maxwell companies, that the
SFO's powers should be restricted to enable liquidation operations to be
carried out speedily and effectively.
Lord Justice Steyn said the ruling 'will enable the contextual scene, such
as the hierarchy of companies, the role of individuals, the flow of funds,
and like matters, to be placed before the jury far more effectively than has
hitherto been regarded as possible'.
He added that it should 'improve the chances of the SFO system functioning
more efficiently'.

FT  08 APR 93 / Staff shares 'help attitude'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT increase in the number of employee share schemes over the past
decade has helped improve workers' attitudes towards work, although they
might not be working any harder, a report in today's Employment Gazette, the
journal of the Department of Employment, says.
Drawing on a survey jointly commissioned by the department, the Inland
Revenue and the Treasury, the report says schemes are more common in the
finance, banking, insurance and business services sectors.
'An important part of the explanation for this is that awareness of tax
advantages and financial matters in general tends to be higher in these
sectors,' says the report.
Schemes, particularly Save As You Earn schemes, were also more prevalent in
large quoted companies, the report adds. Their introduction into private
companies was potentially more complicated - for example because of the lack
of any obvious market value.
Managers appeared to introduce employee share schemes on their own
initiative, with unions exerting little pressure for them, according to the
report.
Employee involvement was the most important effect sought by companies that
introduced share schemes. Overall managers judged their schemes to have a
positive effect, the report says.
However, it adds, managers were reticent about identifying specific positive
outcomes. 'They do not think that employee share schemes per se make
employees work harder or change their behaviour in other ways such as
reduced absenteeism.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Khmer Rouge says it will not accept Cambodia poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPAIGNING for the United Nations-sponsored election in Cambodia next month
began on an ominous note yesterday when the extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge
guerrilla group reaffirmed its opposition to the poll and said it would not
respect the result.
The Khmer Rouge made its announcement as Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, arrived in Phnom Penh to give his backing to one of the
largest and most expensive peace-keeping operations in UN history.
In Brussels, the European Community expressed concern about repeated
ceasefire violations in Cambodia. Peace and security, without intimidation
were needed for the elections, the EC said. It urged all parties to accept
the outcome.
The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to abide by the peace accord signed by
its leaders and those of the other Cambodian factions in Paris in October
1991, is not among the 20 political parties taking part in the May 23-27
elections and is suspected of planning to disrupt the voting.
Mr Mak Ben, a Khmer Rouge spokesman, declined to give a direct answer when
asked at a news conference if his organisation would disrupt the poll,
saying only that it went 'against the spirit and letter of the Paris
agreement'.
'It is in violation of the UN charter. It goes against the sacred right of
self-determination of the Cambodian people. . . We will never accept the
result of the election that will give legitimacy or a cloak of legitimacy to
the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.'
The Paris agreement specifically provides for the election and commits the
signatories to respect the results, but the Khmer Rouge has repeatedly
complained that Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia in breach of the
agreement. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, overthrowing the brutal Khmer
Rouge regime and installing the present administration in Phnom Penh.
The UN's 22,000 military and civilian personnel have been unable to prevent
an upsurge in violence as the elections approach. Last month more than 100
people were killed, many of them Vietnamese migrant fishermen massacred by
gunmen thought to be members of the Khmer Rouge. Only last week three
Bulgarian UN soldiers were killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas they had invited
to supper.

FT  08 APR 93 / India eases bank reserve rules: Reserve Bank acts to
increase credit to industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER and R. C. MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Reserve Bank of India yesterday announced a cut in the reserve
requirements of commercial banks to help boost credit to industry, Reuter
reports from Bombay. However, the central bank left the key minimum lending
rate unchanged at 17 per cent.
Mr Chakravarty Rangarajan, the bank's governor, said the statutory liquidity
ratio of commercial banks would be lowered by 1 percentage point to 36.75
per cent. The banks' cash reserve ratio would be cut by 1 point to 14 per
cent.
Mr Rangarajan was announcing the central bank's credit policy for the first
six months of the 1993-94 fiscal year.
He said the cuts in the two reserve requirements would make an additional
Rs49.5bn (Pounds 1.05bn) available for lending.
'The hesitant industrial recovery in 1992-93 must be converted into a strong
revival in 1993-94,' the governor said. 'Adequate availability of credit
will be critical in converting the weak industrial recovery into a strong
revival.'
Some bankers and businessmen had expected a further cut in minimum lending
rate, which was reduced by 1 point to 17 per cent when the budget was
announced on February 27.
RC Murthy, in Bombay, adds: The central bank also announced restrictions
would be lifted on some interest rates in an effort to encourage inflows of
foreign currency.
Lending rate curbs are scrapped for rupee funds issued against foreign
currency deposits. In exchange, banks will have to absorb exchange rate
fluctuation risk, which is currently borne by the Reserve Bank.
The scheme is optional, which means restrictions will stay if banks choose
not to take on the exchange rate risk. Analysts say the scheme would be
attractive to foreign banks, which have to invest 37.5 per cent of their
deposits in low-yield government bonds and to earmark 15 per cent of their
loans to small businesses and exports at fixed interest rates.

FT  08 APR 93 / BMW to assemble cars in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, THE GERMAN luxury carmaker, plans to assemble cars in Vietnam from next
year, in a venture signalling the increased pace of the country's economic
change.
The company has signed an agreement to set up a sales, parts and service
network in Vietnam, and intends to assemble up to 200 cars a year.
The initial number of units is modest but Mr Bernd Wiegand, managing
director for BMW Asia, said the decision was 'strategic' and reflected the
company's confidence in the development of Vietnam and the availability of
qualified labour.
Manufacturing will be confined to the 316i and the 520i models, to be built
out of assembly kits shipped from Germany. Some parts will be manufactured
locally.
The venture is important in Vietnam's quest for foreign investment, backed
by radical economic reforms as the country moves away from central planning
and state control, but hampered by a US embargo on business with the
communist country and by poor infrastructure.
Many foreign manufacturers, however, are attracted by a cheap labour force
and by opportunities when the US ban is fully lifted and funding from
international financial institutions begins to flow.
Vietnam's motor industry is in its infancy and the road network in need of
upgrading and repair, but many Vietnamese have cash savings which could be
used to buy vehicles as the economy grows.
The agreement with Vietnam Motors Corporation is a Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m)
joint venture, 70 per cent owned by Columbian Motors of the Philippines
(assembler of Japanese and South Korean cars in the Philippines) and 30 per
cent by Hoa Binh, a state-owned bus manufacturer based in Hanoi.

FT  08 APR 93 / Share prices bubble again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HECTIC TRADING and bristling confidence in recent weeks on the Tokyo stock
exchange have brought back memories of the 'bubble' days of the late 1980s.
The Nikkei average, which measures Tokyo stock prices, touched 20,000
yesterday for the first time since March last year, prompting Mr Kazuo
Tamayama, an investment strategist, to describe the unexpected rise as 'a
mini-bubble'. The Nikkei closed at 19,829.23 yesterday, up 342.43 on the day
and 38 per cent above its low in August.
Interest rates are low, and there is even talk of support for land prices.
The economic backdrop is, however, reminiscent of the earlier 1980s, when
exporting companies were hit with a higher yen, interest rates were at
historical lows, and the government introduced a Y6,000bn (Pounds 35bn)
emergency economic package.
The official discount rate was cut to 2.5 per cent in February, and the
government will announce yet another emergency package next week.
A report released this week by the Ministry of Finance, defines a 'bubble'
as a sharp dissociation between the theoretical and actual values of assets.
The report reflects the reasons for the surge in asset values in the 1980s,
although it is unclear if the ministry would define the recent highs reached
on the Tokyo market as 'actual' or 'theoretical'.
Even though corporate profits are falling while price/earnings ratios have
reached levels unseen since the bubble years, brokers insist the market rise
is completely rational. Mr Chisato Haganuma, strategist at Nomura
Securities, says: 'The stock market is discounting the future recovery in
corporate earnings,' although he adds that profits at companies may not see
a full fledged rise for three to four years.
Such reasoning does not make much difference to investors in search of
investments offering high returns. Money market interest rates have fallen
sharply, while the bond market has peaked, losing 40 per cent in the last
two weeks.
Politicians are playing a role in talking up stock prices, and are even
encouraging a rise in land prices, another bubble feature. Mr Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's team working on the
economic package, wants public funds to be pumped into the property sector
for advance purchase of land for public works projects. He also suggested
that the package should include assistance for ailing banks through
supporting property prices.
Meanwhile, Japanese newspapers are cheering on stock prices, and
highlighting every 'green shoot' of economic recovery. But capital spending
is still falling, job opportunities are contracting, and consumer demand is
still very weak.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday expressed concern
at the rapid rise of share prices, saying the stock market should reflect
corporate earnings.
But some suspect that the Finance Ministry has developed a fondness for
bubbles, believing that a surge in asset prices is the only prescription for
the economy, wobbling under the heavy burdens inherited from the collapse of
the last bubble.

FT  08 APR 93 / Subsidies urged for computer workers

JAPAN'S computer makers are to seek government employment subsidies,
underlining the severity of the downturn in the country's high technology
industries.
The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association, representing 198
companies, is to ask the Ministry of Labour for help under its employment
assistance programme. This provides funds to companies in designated
industries where production cuts have made it harder to keep workers in
employment.
The scheme, which was started in 1974, is intended to help prevent
unemployment and is funded by Japan's unemployment insurance, which is
compulsory.
Companies belonging to one of the designated industries can apply for aid to
re-train employees, transfer them to subsidiaries or other parts of the
business or simply to pay staff while a factory is temporarily closed. To do
so, they must provide the authorities with a convincing plan of how they
intend to use the money.
The Labour Ministry has recognised 119 sectors, from steel mills to vehicle
body manufacturers, as industries qualifying for employment assistance.
For the computer industry, however, which is applying for the first time,
the need for such assistance is a clear sign of the difficult times ahead
for the industry.
Japan's computer output dropped 10.2 per cent last year to Y5,460bn (Pounds
32bn) in value, and the association is expecting the level to be about the
same this year. It has been suffering a sharp fall in orders as Japanese
companies, particularly in the financial sector, have scaled back
investment.
Consumers also held back from purchases towards the end of last year in the
face of an intense price war, according to Dataquest, the high technology
consultancy.

FT  08 APR 93 / Kazakhs move slowly to negotiate deals that will unlock
their riches: An ex-Soviet republic with multi-billion dollar resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAZAKHSTAN, with some of the world's richest oil, natural gas and mineral
reserves, has a rosier economic outlook than most of its former Soviet
compatriots. Unless it deliberately botches the job, the central Asian
republic is destined to be rich.
Kazakhstan and its western business partners are engaged in painstaking
talks on two multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas deals that are bound
to trigger an economic boom.
And the republic and foreign bankers are debating how, in a five- or
six-year transition, to make the expansion sustained and broad.
Until the negotiations and debate are resolved, Kazakhstan - starting from
scratch in creating a market-oriented economy - will not have the hard cash
it needs to begin turning around its struggling, inflationary economy.
'The Kazakhs are trying very hard to get it right,' said a western diplomat
in the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata. 'They're not prepared to do deals where
in 10 years they're left with nothing. Nor should they be. They hesitate a
little, because they feel they don't have the expertise to deal with these
very large, very clever western companies.'
Since the Soviet Union broke up more than a year ago, Kazakhstan has
attracted a lot of attention because of the Baikonur space centre, from
which flights were launched, and the Semipalatinsk nuclear-weapons testing
facility.
These, plus its natural resources, nuclear arsenal and geographic position -
sandwiched between Russia, China and the rest of central Asia - have given
the republic of 17m people political status in and out of the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
In this role the Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been a
leading advocate of restoration of economic links among the ex-Soviet
republics, and a moderate voice on nuclear issues.
Kazakhstan's prospects are immediately hinged on two deals currently in
negotiation. Chevron, the fourth largest US oil company, is bidding to
develop the Tengiz oil field which, with at least 6bn-9bn barrels of
recoverable reserves, is in the same league as Saudi Arabia's largest.
The deal would pump an initial Dollars 1.5bn into the Kazakh economy over
the next three years, and could be worth Dollars 20bn over 40 years. At the
same time, British Gas and Italy's Agip are negotiating to develop the
Karachaganak field, which contains 20,000bn cubic feet of natural gas, plus
2bn barrels of oil and condensate. This deal involves Dollars 6bn in
investment in the first decade.
Kazakhstan also possesses substantial chromium, gold, silver, zinc, lead and
iron ore deposits. The republic mined 130m tonnes of coal in 1991, a quarter
of the Soviet total, and last year exported 10m tonnes of wheat.
The government is also starting to examine bids on a Dollars 100m deal to
refurbish a huge cigarette factory in Alma Ata and revitalise Kazakhstan's
tobacco crop. The bidding is among the same three companies warring across
Europe - British-American Tobacco, RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris.
Meanwhile, however, Kazakhstan is largely stagnated in its Soviet past, and
is moving only slowly to consummate the deals and begin its predicted
ascent. Both the Chevron and British Gas-Agip agreements - complex
negotiations involving installation of basic infrastructure in remote,
backward regions as well as a huge build-up of extraction technology - were
supposed to be completed by April 1.
Neither is likely to be soon, say government officials. 'Karachaganak won't
be finished before October,' Mr Galiausat Keshubayev, the energy ministry's
head of foreign relations, says of the British Gas-Agip negotiations.
For now the republic, about the size of western Europe, is in economic
collapse. The economy shrank 14 per cent last year after a 10 per cent fall
in 1991. Inflation was 2,500 per cent in 1992 and real wages fell 20-30 per
cent. The government says the 1993 unfinanced budget deficit will be
Rbs182.9m, or 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product.
The inflation rate, still raging at 25-35 per cent a month, particularly
worries international bankers. Almost all of it is pinned to Russia's
hyperinflation, largely through the rouble's plummeting value and the
spiralling price of goods imported from Kazakhstan's northern neighbour.
Budgetary pressure is intensified by Mr Nazarbayev's policy of containing
the social costs of the economic collapse. A delicate population balance,
for one, complicates his decisions: Kazakhs and ethnic Russians each make up
about 40 per cent of the population, and Mr Nazarbayev is trying carefully
not to antagonise either.
In conservative Central Asia, he is also intent on limiting the kind of
economic upheaval that has rocked Russia. To keep Kazakhs working - there
are just 80,000 officially unemployed - the president is subsidising state
factories; thus far, there has been no attempt to target unprofitable
factories for closure.
With what he calls an 'anti-crisis programme', Mr Nazarbayev also has
established a safety net in which 3m people, mostly pensioners and war
veterans, are receiving a monthly income of Rbs3,000, Rbs500 above the
minimum wage.
The key problem now is with the International Monetary Fund. After 18 months
of talks, the IMF is stalling up to Dollars 700m in assistance, mostly over
the fund's belief that Kazakhstan should leave the rouble zone and establish
its own currency.
IMF reasoning is that, with little prospect of Russia managing inflation,
other republics in the rouble zone stand little chance of taking control of
their own economies. Thus, the IMF's strict economic targets would be hard
to meet, and Kazakhstan would also be hard-pressed to repay its debts.
Kazakhstan, however, though conceptually agreeing with the fund, is worried
about supporting a currency: it has few reserves, and there is no guarantee
that a Kazakh currency would be stronger than the rouble.
The chances are that the republic will not bend to the IMF's will on the
currency issue at least for the next few months, says Mr Oraz Jandosov,
deputy economics minister and one of the president's leading economic
architects. So Kazakhstan will probably be left for now without the cash to
finance the deficit and begin fundamentals such as building basic
infrastructure.
Together, the problems make the coming years look rocky. 'This country has
great potential,' says a foreign banker. 'But you're looking at five or six
years of transition before you get there.'

FT  08 APR 93 / Industry sees 2.4% growth in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Economic Planning Agency said a survey of leading industrial
companies found that most expect the Japanese economy to grow by about 2.4
per cent this fiscal year - well below the official government forecast of
3.3 per cent.
The survey of 1,882 non-financial companies listed on the country's three
largest stock exchanges also found that only 2.5 per cent have resorted to
early retirement schemes or dismissed workers as part of their cost-cutting
programmes.
Export-oriented manufacturers told the EPA that an exchange rate of Y124 to
the US dollar was about the break-even point for their companies, though the
Japanese currency has traded as low as Y113.30 over the past week and
hovered around the Y114 level on the Tokyo foreign exchange market
yesterday.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, speaking after a meeting of
regional branch managers of his bank, said there was no good economic reason
for the sudden rise in the yen, as a recovery was unlikely until late this
year.
However, he cited an apparent lift in corporate confidence in recent weeks
as a good sign for economic activity, which has been restrained by
executives' generally gloomy expectations for consumer demand and capital
spending this year.
The EPA said companies responding to its survey planned to increase capital
spending by an annual average of 2.8 per cent over the next three years -
over the past three years, annual growth has averaged 10.5 per cent.
EPA officials said Japanese companies did not want to lay off workers, but
clearly believed they were carrying excess staff, notably middle-aged
managers. About 67 per cent of companies said they had too many
administrative staff, while 34.6 per cent claim to have too many managers in
technical divisions.

FT  08 APR 93 / Plea to drop Clifford charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Justice Department yesterday asked for the dismissal of federal
charges against Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman over the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International scandal, writes George Graham.
The department said it had decided to ask for the dismissal because of Mr
Clifford's ill health, and so as not to interfere with a parallel
prosecution of Mr Altman and Mr Clifford on charges in New York state.
The two men were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of deceiving US
bank regulators over BCCI's covert takeover of First American, a Washington
bank.
Their federal trial was due to start on June 1 but a senior department
official told a federal court in Washington that it was near-certain Mr
Clifford's ill health would not let him stand trial then. The Democratic
former defence secretary, 86, recently underwent a quadruple heart by-pass.
Mr Altman's New York trial, on fraud and bribery charges to do with BCCI,
began last month and is expected to last about two months.
Even if it were ended before the federal trial's scheduled start,
preparations for the latter would burden both the New York prosecutors and
Mr Altman's defence, said the official.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Italian car market tumbles - Government
will protest to Brussels over soaring Japanese sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is to complain to the European Commission about
surging Japanese car exports, after sales figures for March showed a sharp
rise in Japanese registrations against a steeply falling market.
New car sales in Italy, Europe's second biggest market, dropped by almost 21
per cent in March. The fall was the biggest since sales plummeted in late
1974 and early 1975, after the first oil price crisis.
The Rome government will argue that Japanese exports to Italy are running
well above the 17.5 per cent increase to 42,900 hammered out for this year
between European Community and Japanese negotiators last week.
It will also claim that sales of Nissan's UK-built Micra compact car, which
have soared this year, represent an unfair case of 'targeting' one model at
a single market, a practice forbidden under an earlier EC-Japanese accord.
Domestic manufacturers, largely Fiat, bore the brunt of last month's sales
drop, with a 22.4 per cent fall in registrations. Although imports dropped
by 19.5 per cent, most Japanese marques, notably UK-made 'transplants' such
as Nissan's Micra and Primera models, performed strongly.
Nissan, the biggest Japanese exporter to Italy, raised sales by 90 per cent
to 4,372, boosted by demand for the Micra. Honda and Toyota also performed
well. However, in spite of the increases, Japanese models still account for
less than 5 per cent of the Italian market.
Until last month, Italy had been partly isolated from the steep falls in
demand seen in most neighbouring countries. Analysts attributed the sharp
drop to rising unemployment and growing worries about the recession. Buyers
may also have been put off by the general climate of political uncertainty,
and price rises for some foreign models caused by the near 30 per cent
decline in the value of the lira agains the D-Mark and most other European
currencies.
However, many foreign manufacturers have kept price rises well below the
level of the lira's devaluation so as to maintain market share.

FT  08 APR 93 / Argentine debt crisis ends with bank deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S 11-year foreign debt crisis was formally ended yesterday by the
signing of a debt reduction plan with creditor banks in New York. The
government calculates the agreement will reduce by a third the burden of
servicing Dollars 19.29bn in debt principal.
The debt reduction mechanism, similar to that for other Latin American
countries, was devised by Mr Nicholas Brady, former US treasury secretary.
Under this formula banks concede a debt reduction in exchange for bonds
collateralised by US Treasury zero coupon bonds.
Argentina yesterday handed the banks Dollars 16.97bn in 'Brady bonds' and
banks transferred foreign debt certificates covering principal and a further
Dollars 8.3bn in interest arrears. Arrears are covered by separate 12-year
floating rate bonds not backed by collateral.
The 30-year Brady bonds come in two varieties, allowing banks to choose
between preserving principal or interest. Par bonds represent the full value
of debt principal but pay low, fixed interest of 4 per cent a year,
gradually rising to a maximum 6 per cent in seven years' time. Discount
bonds represent only 65 per cent of principal, but pay floating interest of
 13/16 per cent over Libor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNALS that the new French government wanted 'trade peace' were welcomed
yesterday by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, writes Nancy Dunne
in Washington. He called for relations between the 'two new governments' to
be placed on a 'more positive footing'.
Mr Kantor last week came under fire when, on his first visit as trade
representative to the European Community, he refused to offer the usual US
homilies about free trade. His insistence on a pragmatic, market-opening
policy raised fears that the US would close its own market if its demands
were not met.
Apparently anxious to show his desire for trade peace, Mr Kantor responded
to statements on Tuesday by Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime
minister, who said that although he would press for 'improvements' to the
global farm trade agreement, he wanted 'trade peace with Washington'. The
French premier added he did not want to cause a crisis within the EC or the
Uruguay Round negotiations over farm trade.

FT  08 APR 93 / Inner-city phoenix is slow to rise: George Graham chronicles
the attempts to revive small businesses in the wake of last year's riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE inner city of Los Angeles, the credit crunch which many US small
businesses complain about takes on a different form.
Many businessmen - under the shadow of last year's riots, and amid fears of
more to follow - believe that banks may remain reluctant to lend in the
inner city and that scarcity of capital will prevent them catching the
rising tide when southern California eventually emerges from recession.
Also, many Los Angeles banks complain that the shortage is not so much of
bank capital as of qualified borrowers with sound proposals for commercial
loans.
Founders National Bank, the only black-owned bank in California, sits in the
middle. Set up two years ago from the remains of a failed savings and loan
institution, Founders has been able to attract new capital in the wake of
riots.
Arco, the Los Angeles-based oil and gas group, has invested Dollars 1m in
the bank. Bank of America sold Founders two of its branches in south central
Los Angeles, taking payment in Founders preferred stock and capital notes.
Mr Carlton Jenkins, Founders managing director, says he can turn these
stakes into 15 times as much investment in the south central community where
he grew up. He hopes to announce other investors shortly.
'We have just tried to be a good model of corporate creativity and show by
example that you can do business in the inner city and make money,' he says,
noting that Founders made a Dollars 1m profit in its first year and will
report one of about Dollars 1.3m for 1992.
But Mr Jenkins notes wryly that his own business has had no luck with
traditional sources of finance such as investment banks or pension funds.
'I still don't have any investment bankers knocking on the door. I think it
is principally because my little bank sits in the inner city,' he says.
Finding sources of finance remains a problem for business people in the
inner city. 'We have a lot of entrepreneurs who are at a level that, with a
good shot of capital and a bit of 'mentoring', they could take one of these
chicken restaurants we have and turn it into a chain,' says Mr Jenkins.
Rebuild LA, a private sector task force set up after the riots last year to
try to help spur investment and economic development in the more depressed
areas of Los Angeles, hopes to meet a part of this need by setting up an
equity fund to make investments of between Dollars 250,000 and Dollars 1m in
expanding businesses.
Dr Kathleen Connell, an academic and investment banker who chairs RLA's
business investment task force, hopes to raise Dollars 10m. With backing
from the federal Small Business Administration, that could turn into a
Dollars 40m pool. The fund is expected to be ready for launch in June.
One side effect of the fund may be to remove an excuse for financial
institutions which say they would really like to invest in the inner city
but somehow never quite get around to it.
'They all say they are looking for the vehicle. We are going to give them
the vehicle,' says Dr Connell.
As important, however, may be the need for much smaller capital injections
to bring people with entrepreneurial potential into the formal economy - for
example, to help an illegal street vendor buy a shop.
Finance at this level can be difficult for a bank to take on. A recent
survey of minority-owned banks doing business in riot-affected areas of Los
Angeles showed that most complained of unsophisticated borrowers with
inadequate financial statements, non-existent business plans, limited
borrower's equity and a lack of financial guarantees.
Disney, the entertainment group, has undertaken a project in Los Angeles
providing loans of less than Dollars 20,000, at interest rates below 5 per
cent over five years, to small entrepreneurs without collateral.
The loan funds are administered by Los Angeles Renaissance, a programme run
by the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in south central Los
Angeles.
Some of the city's Asian communities have well-established networks for
informal financing, but Dr Connell says this form of silent capital does not
exist to the same extent in the black or Hispanic communities.
However, Mr Greg Hightower, who was able to secure finance to buy a cleaning
business on south central's Crenshaw Boulevard when the former owner moved
out after the riots, considers himself living proof that the money is there
if you look hard enough.
'It's not like it's Battle Creek, Michigan - there's a lot of money out
there,' he says. 'You're in Los Angeles. If you just keep spreading the
word, you might get lucky.'

FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Virgin to double size of its fleet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN Atlantic Airways, the UK long-haul airline, has confirmed it will
double the size of its fleet by leasing four new Airbus A340-300 and four
Boeing 747-400 aircraft.
All eight will be leased from International Lease Financing Corp, based in
Los Angeles and part of American International Group.
Virgin has also taken an option on a new-generation Boeing 777 from ILFC and
is negotiating directly with Boeing to acquire up to four 777s for delivery
after 1996.
The acquisitions will help counter criticism of the airline that its fleet
of Boeing 747s is too old.
'By the middle of the decade, our passengers will be flying one of the
world's youngest fleets to a growing number of destinations in the US and
further afield,' said Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman.
Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus Industrie's managing director, said the order was an
important breakthrough in the UK airline business. A Pounds 4bn order
British Airways had placed with Boeing in 1991 triggered an Airbus complaint
to the European Commission.
The first Airbus delivery to Virgin will be in October, with the Boeings
coming next year.

accord

<TEXT>
BOLIVIA and Chile have signed a tariff-cutting agreement, during a two-day
conference of Rio Group foreign ministers in the eastern Bolivian city of
Santa Cruz.
Under the trade accord, Chile and Bolivia will abolish tariffs on 150 goods.
Both will contact private-sector companies to start studying the feasibility
of a pipeline to export Bolivian natural gas to northern Chile.
Chilean exports to Bolivia were worth some Dollars 135m (Pounds 95m) last
year, while Bolivian exports to Chile were worth Dollars 18m, though the La
Paz government believes the accord will increase this by Dollars 35m.
The conference called on President Bill Clinton to continue the Enterprise
for the Americas Initiative of his predecessor. Mr Enrique Silva Cimma,
Chilean foreign minister and conference spokesman, said freer trade with the
US should not block greater economic integration between Latin American
countries.
Venezuela signalled it was willing to resume diplomatic relations with Peru,
which were broken when President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress last
April.
Both Peru and Panama were invited to rejoin the Rio group. Panama, asked to
rejoin as part of the Central American delegation, may continue to seek
individual membership.
The Rio Group meeting, attended by 12 Latin American and Caribbean foreign
ministers, was preparing for an October meeting of Rio Group heads of state
in Chile.

FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: China unable to keep pace with aviation
demand - Airlines are having to beg, borrow or barter aircraft

PASSENGERS on domestic flights in China may be surprised to discover they
are boarding a Russian aircraft with a Russian cockpit and cabin crew.
The reason: the Chinese simply do not have enough aircraft and crews of
their own to meet the unprecedented growth in demand for seats.
Indeed, from its decision to lease Russian-built Ilyushins and Tupolevs from
the former Soviet republics to its recent announcement of purchases of a
dozen Airbuses, with options for 13 more, the aviation business in China is
booming.
The country's annual increase in air traffic is estimated to be running at
about 25 per cent this year - more than double the 12 per cent of the peak
growth periods in the US in the 1960s.
'There has not been a single year since 1984 when growth in passenger
traffic has not been over 20 per cent,' said a western business executive.
'Even in 1989, when there was a dip for six months (because of the Tiananmen
Square crackdown), growth was still over 20 per cent.'
With the dramatic increase in domestic air freight and passenger travel,
provinces rushed to establish their own airlines, often at the expense of
safety and flight efficiency.
At last count, China had 25-30 airlines. But its safety record was spotty
last year, with at least four publicly reported disasters that killed 276
people.
On Tuesday this week two people on a China Eastern Airlines flight to Los
Angeles were killed and more than 150 injured when heavy turbulence rocked
the aircraft.
The aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at a US Air Force base
in Alaska.
Under the terms of its deals with the Russians, China's state-owned airlines
will lease 16 aircraft from the former Soviet republics.
In an arrangement called a 'wet lease', the foreign carriers provide the
aircraft, pilots, cabin crews, and ground service personnel. The aircraft
involved are Ilyushin 86s and Tupolev 154s.
The Russians are also selling or bartering Tupolev 154s. While the Chinese
use them as a last resort - they use more fuel and are not as reliable - but
they are much cheaper than western aircraft.
Even China United Airlines, a civilian airline operated by the Chinese Air
Force, has announced it will buy another Tupolev to add to its fleet of
Tupolevs, Boeings, and Tridents. This is all part of a move by the Air Force
to further convert more of its operations into more profitable civilian
activities.
As Chinese economic reforms spread, the country's airports and aviation
infrastructure are unable to keep pace with demand. New airports are being
built around the country and old ones are being expanded and modernised.
The airline industry is undergoing a comprehensive restructuring. The Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which formerly acted as a kind of
super-agency combining the policy-making roles of the US Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) and the management of all Chinese airlines, is being
dismantled. The CAAC will now operate more along the lines of western
regulatory organisations.
Airlines can now be categorised into three groups. The first comprises six
large state-owned airlines: Air China, China Eastern, China Northern, China
Southern, China Southwestern, and China Northwestern.
These airlines are free to float bonds and shares, sign joint ventures, and
create subsidiaries, but for new aircraft purchases they still need central
government approval.
The second group of airlines includes Xinjiang Air and Yunnan Air and a few
more specialised airlines which CAAC headquarters controls directly. Despite
provincial and local government pressure to be free of Beijing's directives,
CAAC retains its authority over these airlines to allocate routes.
The third includes all those owned by local governments and other
shareholders. Shenzhen Airline, for example, is owned by AirChina, the
People's Construction Bank, China Travel Service of Hong Kong, and the
Shenzhen municipal government.
To cope with growing passenger demand, western sources estimate that Chinese
airlines will need to acquire 500 planes over the next decade, each with a
capacity of more than 100 seats.
So far, Boeing is the front runner in this market with about 100 Boeings in
service, which is more than any other foreign aircraft flown in China. More
are on order.
McDonnell Douglas, which has a co-production arrangement with the Shanghai
Aircraft Industrial Corporation that makes MD-82s, has produced 35
domestically and is negotiating to produce the newer MD-90.
But in the newer, more market-oriented environment, McDonnell Douglas faces
a hard time selling its aircraft. Chinese airlines have always tended to
favour Boeings.
But the boom in the country's air transportation business has also generated
problems, especially those of safety,and CAAC has recently announced plans
to crack down on the growth in the number of local airlines.

AMERICAN trade officials have removed the Philippines from the 'priority
watch list,' used to bring pressure on governments to strengthen laws
protecting copyrights, patents and trademarks.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Rizalino Navarro,
Philippines secretary of trade and industry, signed and exchanged letters on
Tuesday which committed the Philippines to taking various steps on
intellectual property rights. 'These commitments, when fully implemented,
will promote mutual economic growth,' Mr Kantor said.
Steps to be taken by the Philippines include:
Joining the Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic
works;
Submitting legislation to improve the copyright law;
Amending laws and regulations to ensure that internationally accepted
standards on trademarks are implemented;
Establishing new customs guidelines.
