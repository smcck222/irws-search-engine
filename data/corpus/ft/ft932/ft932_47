LOS ANGELES is bracing itself for renewed violence as the second trial of
four police officers involved in the beating of Mr Rodney King, a black
motorist, draws to a close.
Last year, their acquittal in a state court on charges of assault and use of
excessive force in a beating video-taped by a bystander and shown on
television worldwide, set off three days of rioting in the city, claimed
more than 50 lives and resulted in damage estimated at Dollars 2bn.
Tomorrow, a jury is expected to begin its deliberations in the new trial, in
a federal court. This has lasted six weeks. The policemen are accused of
having violated Mr King's civil rights by failing to protect him.
Mr Tom Bradley, Los Angeles mayor, and Mr Willie Williams, city police
chief, have appealed for calm and said that the police department is now
better prepared to deal with potential violence than when the riots broke
out.
However, tension is rising. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that
the national guard had moved armoured vehicles into the area 'to facilitate
a rapid response' and that the city police department, the Los Angeles
county sheriff's department, the California highway patrol and other
agencies had trained to contain violence 'in case disturbances break out
again.'
On Sunday, a televised 'town meeting' drew repudiations of the criminal
justice system from participants who claimed that minorities still face
discrimination from police, prosecutors and judges. 'We have been told to
respect the justice system but injustice has been perpetrated on us,' said
Mr Danny Bakewell, president of the Brotherhood Crusade, a charity group in
south central Los Angeles, an area devastated by the riots. 'We are not
going to allow our people to be abused any longer.'
Fears of renewed rioting have been heightened by rumours that armed gangs
will invade suburban homes and businesses, although local officials say
these stories are based only on the boasts of a few gang members. Even so,
sales of guns are reported to have increased by more than 30 per cent in
recent weeks as residents prepare themselves for feared attacks.

FT  08 APR 93 / Battles loom as US budget details due
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration is to publish its full budget today, fleshing out the
outline package put forward by President Bill Clinton in February.
However, this broad framework has already been altered by Congress, and the
details of how the administration plans to increase taxes and cut specific
programmes from beekeepers' subsidies to space stations will pave the way
for fierce congressional battles.
Several department heads have found it impossible to reshape their budgets
in any significant way in the 11 weeks since they took office. Mr Les Aspin,
defence secretary, has already acknowledged that his department's budget is
'treading water' until he can review military needs and objectives from the
bottom up.
Nevertheless, the budget will bear the marks of the new Democratic
administration, with lower defence spending and higher taxes on the wealthy
aimed at cutting the deficit, and increased spending on environment,
technology and infrastructure projects.
The budget resolution passed by Congress sets out a path for government
spending to climb from Dollars 1,507bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,801bn in 1998.
This trims cumulative outlays over the five years by Dollars 218bn from the
baseline budget submitted by former President George Bush just before he
left office and by Dollars 19bn from Mr Clinton's original plan.
Revenues are to rise from Dollars 1,242bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,554bn in
1998, Dollars 148bn more over five years than the Bush baseline and Dollars
48bn more than Mr Clinton's original plan. The budget deficit is projected
to fall from Dollars 262bn in 1994 to Dollars 193bn in 1997, before climbing
again to Dollars 202bn in 1998.
These deficit projections, however, could be reduced still further if Mr
Clinton is unable to persuade the Senate to pass the Dollars 16bn stimulus
spending bill which he says is necessary to provide an immediate boost to
the economy and safeguard the recovery.
The Republican minority in the Senate has so far succeeded in blocking the
bill, and Mr Clinton has agreed to discuss changes, but he is still fighting
to preserve the bulk of it.
Administration officials hope Republican senators will come under pressure
from their constituents when they return home for the Easter/Passover
recess, especially from the numerous Republican mayors who have endorsed the
spending package.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE title of top-selling maker of imported cars in Japan last month went to
Honda Motor, whose increased imports of vehicles from its US factories
exceeded the sales of foreign makers such as Volkswagen and BMW for the
first time, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
Honda's imported car sales tripled from a year earlier to 4,569 units and
those of Toyota Motor were almost four times higher at 1,339 units, as
consumers wanting an imported car increasingly chose a Japanese-badged
vehicle.
Total sales of imported vehicles for the month were 32 per cent higher at
22,977 units, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said. Excluding
Japanese-badged vehicles, sales rose by a more modest 8.2 per cent.
For the fiscal year ended in March, sales of imported cars slipped 0.5 per
cent to 190,977 units, with sales of cars with engines over 2,000cc 1.4 per
cent higher, and those of smaller vehicles down 3.9 per cent.
The big loser in March was Volkswagen, which saw a 31 per cent fall in sales
due to a severing of ties with Yanase, the dominant retailer of imported
cars. Volkswagen, previously the market leader, finished behind Honda, BMW
and Mercedes-Benz.
Yanase has a new relationship with Opel, while Volkswagen has an agreement
with Toyota to use its dealer system and the German company is expanding its
own sales network.

<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Mario Cuomo of New York has taken himself out of consideration for
nomination to the US Supreme Court, according to news reports yesterday,
writes George Graham.
Mr Cuomo, who has long been an eloquent social conscience for the Democratic
party, had been viewed as the front-runner to replace Justice Byron White,
who will retire from the court in the summer.
President Bill Clinton refused to discuss the Supreme Court appointment
yesterday, but said he thought Mr Cuomo was 'terrific'.
During the presidential election campaign last year, Mr Clinton had said he
thought the New York governor would make a good Supreme Court justice, and
Mr Cuomo himself has said the position would be heaven. In his usual
ambivalent style, though, he also likened the court to a tomb.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN European postal services, including the British Post Office, came
under pressure from the European Commission yesterday to improve the
fairness and transparency of their charges, following complaints that they
are stifling competition from private operators.
Brussels said it had opened a formal inquiry into allegations that national
postal services in Germany, Belgium, France, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland
and Britain were deliberately hampering the 'remailing' of bulk mail by
private couriers.
The move comes before EC telecommunications ministers next month discuss the
outcome of talks on the Commission's outline plan for further liberalisation
of EC postal services. The International Express Couriers' Conference
complained to Brussels that postal authorities had changed the way they
charge for remailed items, which couriers are paid to collect from large
clients and deliver to countries where tariffs are lower.
In particular, the IECC said national administrations had begun to take into
account each item, rather than charge for the weight of the whole delivery.
It also said letters posted outside the country where the sender was based
were often returned or subjected to additional charges.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, said he hoped the complaint
could be resolved in the context of debates over the Commission's
liberalisation plans. Commission officials said postal administrations had
already begun work on making their costs, and thus the calculation of their
fees, more transparent.
Royal Mail said the EC had not criticised its general postage charges, but
had merely taken a further step in examining a complaint filed five years
ago about remailing. 'Remailing represents a situation which could become a
threat to our customers,' Royal Mail added. 'If the practice became
widespread, it could result in a majority of our loyal UK customers having
to pay higher postage prices to subsidise the minority of customers who are
evading UK domestic postage.'

GERMANY'S constitutional court yesterday failed to defuse tensions in the
coalition government after it adjourned proceedings without a ruling on the
legality of German military participation in the enforcement of the no-fly
zone over Bosnia, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Constitutional judges in Karlsruhe will meet again today to debate the
appeal made by liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in the
coalition, against an earlier cabinet decision for Germans to fly Nato
missions in Awacs surveillance aircraft once the United Nations no-fly zone
is enforced.
The judges are expected to rule today only on the validity of an interim
injunction requested by the FDP. If they issue the injunction, it would
prevent German participation until the court rules on whether involvement in
such missions violates a vague constitutional ban on German military
participation in combat operations outside of the Nato area.

FT  08 APR 93 / Italy's bank chief hints at recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday threw his
weight behind a gathering consensus that the Italian economy was beginning
to show the first modest signs of recovery.
The governor's comments, made during a public lecture, were hedged by
caution. Nevertheless, they reflect the view held by Confindustria, the
industrialists' association, that order books have begun to improve and the
economy is benefiting from a surge in exports as a result of last
September's devaluation.
Mr Ciampi observed: 'The results in terms of prices, of labour costs and of
foreign trade confirm the opportunity our economy has - and which it has
begun to grasp.'
The economy is scheduled to grow 0.5 per cent this year. But if the modest
recovery becomes more sustained and interest rates move further downward,
the growth rate could increase - despite the problems created by Italy's
political crisis and corruption scandals.
Mr Ciampi insisted the weakness of the lira, which has touched L1,000
against the D-Mark and depressed prices in the bond market, was the result
of political uncertainties more than economic fundamentals. 'In recent days
the bond market and the lira have been hit by uncertainties due to doubts
about the political situation, not a worsening of domestic or international
economic conditions.'
The Bank of Italy has on several occasions maintained that the lira at its
current parity of close to L1,000 to the D-Mark is under-valued. However,
exporters have begun to take advantage of the historic opportunity presented
by a devaluation of almost 30 per cent, accompanied by inflation running at
an annualised 4.2 per cent.
Export figures for February for non-EC countries showed a 25 per cent rise
over the same period the previous year. The rise of non-EC exports, which
account for 40 per cent of the total, combined with a decline in imports,
ensured the trade deficit in the first two months of the year was L626bn
(Pounds 260m) compared with L2,500bn a year ago.
Because of the EC's new customs procedures introduced in January, Community
trade figures are still not known. However, the level of Italian exports is
understood to have begun to concern the Germans and French. At the same time
a study prepared for the trade unions showed wages were lagging well behind
inflation. In 1992 wages grew on average at 4.7 per cent against inflation
of 5.4 per cent. In the public sector wages grew at only 2.2 per cent.

FT  08 APR 93 / Bank of France may announce interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH franc money market rates continued to fall sharply yesterday amid
expectations that the Bank of France might cut its official interest rates
today.
The cost of borrowing French francs for three months eased from about 9.5
per cent at the start of the day to around 9 per cent by the close of
trading in London.
Dealers said this was the lowest level at which 3-month French franc
interest rates had been since November of last year.
The fall in French money market rates came in spite of a smaller reduction
than had been expected in the cost of borrowing wholesale funds from the
Bundesbank.
The German central bank announced yesterday that the lowest accepted repo
rate for 14 days was at 8.13 per cent, and that it was at 8.15 per cent for
35-day funds. The market had been expecting the repo rate to be cut down to
8.10 per cent or even lower.
Despite the smaller-than-expected cut, the French franc continued to
strengthen against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.3834 in London from a
previous FFr3.3840.
Both the Belgian and Dutch central banks announced small cuts in their
official rates in the wake of the move by the Bundesbank.
Belgium's central bank cut its central money market rate to 7.9 per cent
from 8 per cent, and the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to
the same level.
The reduction in French money market rates brought the spread between
3-month French francs and 3-month D-Marks down to around 1.2 percentage
points yesterday. It had been as high as 4 percentage points at the peak of
the last two attacks on the French currency.

GERMANY'S constitutional court yesterday failed to diffuse mounting tensions
in the coalition government after it adjourned proceedings without a ruling
on the legality of German military participation in the enforcement of the
no-fly zone over Bosnia.
Constitutional judges in Karlsruhe will meet again today to debate the
appeal made by liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in the
coalition, against an earlier cabinet decision for Germans to fly Nato
missions in Awacs surveillance aircraft once the United Nations no-fly zone
is enforced.
Germans make up as much as a third of some of the multinational crews. Their
removal would lessen the effectiveness of the Awacs fleet, which will be at
the heart of Nato's monitoring operation over Bosnian airspace.
The judges are expected to rule today only on the validity of an interim
injunction requested by the FDP. If they issue the injunction, it would
prevent German participation until the court rules on whether involvement in
such enforcement missions violates a vague constitutional ban on German
military participation in combat operations outside of the Nato area.
Chancellor Kohl and the ruling Christian Democrats, eager for Germany to
play a greater international role, argue that article 24 of the constitution
allows for military participation alongside the UN.
If the court agrees to hear the appeal, it could take months before they
rule on it, Mr Gotthard Wehrmann, the court spokesman said.
The court's failure to come to a prompt decision yesterday led to bitter
recriminations from FDP politicians. Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, parliamentary
leader for the FDP, said that the coalition could be jeopardised if the
court refused to hear the full constitutional case brought by the FDP.
The FDP has said it supported in principle a greater German military role in
the former Yugoslavia, but demanded constitutional clarification on the
involvement of German forces. The move, which allows the FDP to both support
the government's overall policy but sue against a specific cabinet decision,
has been widely criticised.

DENMARK is pressing for the European Community to take a political decision
to move forward with a carbon tax in June, before the end of its six-month
presidency, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Svend Auken, Denmark's environment minister, said the new US
administration's decision to levy an additional tax on energy offered 'a
unique chance to speed things up' in the effort to reduce global carbon
dioxide emissions.
EC officials acknowledge, however, that they are unlikely to persuade
Britain to go along with the energy tax, and are looking for a declaration
of principle, with details to be worked out later.
Six countries - Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands - have backed the proposed carbon tax, while France, Portugal,
Greece and Ireland have expressed concerns about how the burden will be
shared. Only Spain and the UK are firmly opposed to it.
EC officials said, however, that they believed Spain could be won over.

FT  08 APR 93 / Moslems relent on Srebrenica refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSLEM authorities in the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica last night
relented and said they would let 1,600 women and children be evacuated
today.
.Their move follows determined action by General Philippe Morillon,
commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, to break the humanitarian
impasse in Srebrenica, where twice in the last few days local Moslem
commanders have refused to allow convoys bringing in food and medicines to
the besieged eastern Bosnian town to evacuate thousands of old and wounded
people, women and children on their way back.
The local Moslem leaders had taken their decision in spite of the suffering
of the inhabitants of Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to 60,000 by
refugees from nearby Serb-occupied areas, because they believed it
contributed to the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing.'
The Serbs make no secret of their desire to incorporate the Srebrenica
region, which has been allocated by international mediators Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen to the Bosnian Moslems, into a Serb-dominated province.
Last night Gen Morillon was heading for Srebrenica with four armoured cars,
followed by a contingent of Canadian troops. Moslem officials have indicated
that, if Srebrenica can be assured of UN protection in the guise of a
Canadian 'blue helmets' unit, they would be prepared to allow resumption of
UN evacuation.
The Bosnian Serb army command had been informed of Gen Morillon's mission,
but had not yet given its reply.
In Brussels meanwhile, the approval by Nato ambassadors of final plans for
using alliance fighters to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, hit a
last-minute snag as a result of French concerns about the rules of
engagement.
French officials said France was anxious to make sure the no-fly zone was
not enforced in such a provocative way that it drew everyone into a war.
As a result, it is possible that final approval will be delayed until today
or next week.
In Sarajevo, snipers killed four civilians trying to cross the airport
runway after Bosnian commanders failed to sign a safe passage deal.

FT  08 APR 93 / Bosnia peace plan in serious trouble: The Vance-Owen
proposal is the only show in town, but it may soon close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen is now in
serious trouble, in spite of the absence of a viable alternative to end the
conflict, according to a growing number of diplomatic observers.
The original strategy of the mediators, to isolate the Bosnian Serbs so that
the full weight of international pressure could be focused on them to sign
the peace agreement, has not, so far, had the desired results.
The fact that the Bosnian Moslems recently joined the Croats in endorsing
the Vance-Owen plan has done little or nothing to persuade the Serbs to
follow suit. Though their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, claims the Serbs are
able to accept 80 per cent of its provisions, the plan has effectively been
rejected by the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament.
What the Bosnian Serbs want is modifications to the Vance-Owen map of the 10
semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, which would
not only give them more territory than the 43 per cent assigned to them, but
ensure that some of it adjoins Serbia proper.
That is not only unacceptable to the Moslems, but the two mediators, who
have done their best to ensure that Bosnia-Hercegovina will remain an
independent state and that the Bosnian Serbs will not be given the
opportunity to join up with the 'motherland.'
The most discouraging aspect is that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
looked upon by Mr Vance and Lord Owen and most of the international
community as the man who holds the key to the Bosnian conflict, has given
only rare signs of putting his full weight behind the efforts to make Mr
Karadzic sign.
The last time he really twisted Mr Karadzic's arm was at the end of January
this year, when he forced him to sign the constitutional framework for
Bosnia-Hercegovina, one of the four sections into which the peace plan is
divided.
President Milosevic's most recent contribution to the peace process was when
he pushed the Bosnian Serbs into agreeing to a ceasefire with the other
warring parties, which is now 10 days old and has held in most areas except
around Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic, however, does not seem to be ready to go the last mile. On the
contrary, he is doing his best to sow dissension in the ranks of the western
members of the United Nations Security Council by embarrassingly heaping
praise on the US for its misgivings about the Vance-Owen plan and its
alleged desire not to play 'the world policeman.'
That there are disagreements between the western allies, not to mention
Russia, on how to handle the Bosnian crisis, has long been an open secret.
The Clinton administration from the very beginning made it plain that it did
not think the Vance-Owen plan was either fair to the Moslems or that it
offered a solution which could be implemented in practice.
At the same time, the US has all along made it clear it does not intend to
act on its own in Bosnia and wants to co-ordinate its policies with its UN
Security Council partners. It thus reluctantly gave its support to the
Vance-Owen peace process, strongly supported by both the 10-nation European
Community and Russia, and is struggling to find an acceptable compromise on
what further sanctions to take against Serbia.
In deference to President Boris Yeltsin's domestic political difficulties,
Mr Clinton is reported to have agreed to postpone a Security Council vote on
tighter sanctions against Serbia, a traditional Russian ally and protege,
until after the planned Russian referendum on April 25.
Washington has also been obliged to rein in its enthusiasm for the selective
lifting of the UN embargo on arms deliveries to the rump Yugoslavia, to help
the Moslems. This is a measure that is strongly opposed not only by Russia,
but by Britain and France, which fear that it would both intensify the war
in Bosnia and increase the vulnerability of their troops on the ground under
UN command.
In the words of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, lifting the
embargo on arms deliveries to the Moslems is more likely to create 'a level
killing field' than contributing to the level playing field in Bosnia talked
about by the Americans.
The US like Britain, France and Russia, is not yet prepared to contemplate
'direct military intervention' in the Bosnian conflict, which would be
tantamount to sending vast numbers of troops to wage war against the Bosnian
Serbs for an indefinite period.
If, however, the Vance-Owen process does not very soon demonstrate that a
diplomatic solution is still on the cards, the calls for tougher military
action are bound to increase, as they already have done following the
humanitarian disaster in Srebrenica.

FT  08 APR 93 / Renewed fighting feared between Moslems and Croats in the
west
</HEADLINE>

COMMANDERS of the Moslem-led Bosnian army fear the eruption of renewed
clashes with Croat forces in spite of pledges by both sides to support an
international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Bosnian commander Humo Esad said this week that the fractured alliance would
break down completely after the declaration last weekend of the Croatian
Defence Council (HVO), the military wing of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic
Union, the sister of the ruling party of Croatia.
The HVO set an April 15 deadline for Moslem forces to withdraw from
provinces designated to Croat control under the peace plan of Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen, United Nations mediators.
'We are ready to fight if we must. But it will be a dangerous political game
for Croats to play now,' said Cmdr Esad, who believes the HVO statement
makes renewed clashes inevitable in central Bosnia.
The HVO declaration means they want Cmdr Esad and his men to withdraw from
Mostar, even though it is their home town.
'They may try to assert control in the smaller towns rather than risk
fighting in Mostar,' he said of Bosnia's second-biggest city which over the
last year of war has shrunk to some 30,000 people, many Moslem refugees from
Serb and Croat-held territory.
Some 50,000 fled the once picturesque southern city on the banks of the
River Neretva, where Moslems comprised 41 per cent, Croats 39 per cent and
Serbs under 20 per cent.
Western diplomats believe renewed fighting between Moslem and Croat forces
could deal a death blow to the Vance-Owen plan. 'We will find out in the
next few days,' said a diplomat this week.
Under the international peace plan, endorsed by Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
Bosnia's Moslem President, and Mr Mate Boban, the Croat nationalist leader,
Mostar is one of three provinces which would be designated to Croat control.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at the weekend rejected the plan to
divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces despite threats of stepped-up
sanctions.
Mr Boban, like Mr Karadzic, his Serbian counterpart, last year declared his
own national mini-state of Herceg-Bosna.
'The HVO wants to unite with Croatia. They have the same uniforms, badges
and symbols. Every day there is more proof of what they are doing here,'
says Cmdr Esad.
The red-and-white checkerboard Croatian symbol is emblazoned on flags and
number plates throughout Mostar except in the ruined centre, where the blue
and yellow fleur-de-lys marks Bosnian government control. The Croatian dinar
is the most-used local currency. The HVO has added influence over the
Bosnian forces because they control five of the power stations on the River
Neretva.
Cmdr Esad, the second in command in Mostar, says the Croats have constantly
blocked the delivery of weapons to the mostly Moslem Bosnian forces and
emergency relief to Moslem refugees.
'The regular Croatian Army takes 50 per cent. The HVO then takes another 50
per cent - leaving us with next to nothing,' he said bitterly. The stormy
alliance collapsed but in January was patched up under a ceasefire brokered
by Mr Vance and Lord Owen.
Despite the truce, the outgunned Moslems are gloomy about the prospects for
peace with the Croats and the Serbs. 'Serbs are kicking down the front door
and the Croats sneaking in the back,' said a Bosnian soldier.
Some western diplomats fear that the failure of the international community
to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia has emboldened Serb and Croat nationalists
to make their land grab in Bosnia. 'The Croat and Serb share a common
contempt for Moslems and plan to carve up Bosnia-Hercegovina,' says one.
Mr Jadranko Prlic, acting prime minister of the self-styled Croat state,
claims 'Moslems expected too much of Croats', smallest of Bosnia's three
main ethnic groups. 'Who can expect Croats, who make up just 17 per cent of
the population, can deliver a free Bosnia-Hercegovina to the Moslems?' he
asks.
Serb forces from the surrounding hills last year bombarded the now blackened
town in which most buildings in the old Turkish centre have been razed.
Bosnian forces, backed by Croat troops, drove Serb fighters out in June.
'In a few days there will be a war between the HVO and the Bosnian army,'
said an electrician, a Croat who, fearing reprisal, spoke on condition of
anonymity. Like many, he described the war in Bosnia as a rural-urban
conflict.
'I am going to fight with the Bosnian army. This is my city and I have
nowhere else to go. The Croats want to rule Mostar, but they have the
villages in the hills,' he said.

FT  08 APR 93 / Morillon tries new tack in Srebrenica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Philippe Morillon, commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia,
yesterday made a fresh attempt to break the humanitarian impasse in
Srebrenica, by trying to station Canadian UN troops in the area.
His efforts follow the refusal twice in the last few days of local Moslem
commanders to allow convoys bringing in food and medicines to the besieged
eastern Bosnian town from evacuating thousands of old and wounded people,
women and children on their way back.
The local Moslem leaders took their decision in spite of the suffering of
the inhabitants of Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to 60,000 by
refugees from nearby Serb-occupied areas, because they believe it
contributes to the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing.'
The Serbs make no secret of their desire to incorporate the Srebrenica
region, which has been allocated by international mediators Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen to the Bosnian Moslems, into a Serb-dominated province.
However, the Moslem officials have indicated that, if Srebrenica can be
assured of UN protection in the guise of a Canadian 'blue helmets' unit,
they would be prepared to allow the resumption of the UN's evacuation
operation.
An advance party of Canadian troops left its central Bosnian base yesterday,
while the rest of the company, totalling 150 men, was due to arrive in
Srebrenica today, the UN said.
The Bosnian Serb army command had been informed of the mission, but had not
yet given its reply.
In Brussels meanwhile, the approval by Nato ambassadors of final plans for
using alliance fighters to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, hit a
last-minute snag as a result of French concerns about the rules of
engagement.
French officials said France was anxious to make sure the no-fly zone was
not enforced in such a provocative way that it drew everyone into a war.
As a result, it is possible that final approval will be delayed until today
or next week.
In Sarajevo, snipers killed four civilians trying to cross the airport
runway after Bosnian commanders failed to sign a safe passage deal reached
with their Serb adversaries.

<TEXT>
JAPAN is to suggest sending teams of industrial 'troubleshooters' to
transform selected former Soviet enterprises into model factories. Tokyo
will raise this idea when it hosts a meeting of trade and industry ministers
from east and west this month.
The troubleshooters would be at the heart of a five-point action programme
to include enterprise reform, conversion of defence industries, trade
promotion, encouragement of foreign investment, and technology transfer,
said Mr Kunio Moriyaki, director-general of the Japanese ministry of
international trade and industry's international trade policy bureau, in
London yesterday.
He is preparing a summit in Tokyo on April 24-25 of trade, industry and
economy ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries and eight
east European and former Soviet states, together with multilateral lending
agencies. This gathering is to follow the meeting next week of G7 foreign
and finance ministers, also in Tokyo, and will focus on 'micro-level
aspects' of the problems faced by the former Soviet states in transition to
market economies, Mr Moriyaki emphasised.
This emphasis reflects concern that, without a clear strategy for tackling
the economic problems of Russia and neighbouring states at the grass roots,
macro-level aid packages like the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 20bn one expected to
be approved by G7 ministers in Tokyo next week might achieve little.
'Without a clear cut micro-level approach, pouring money into the region
will not ensure successful enhancement of economic benefit,' Mr Moriyaki
said. 'Setting broad goals is of course very important, but the question is
how do governments reach their goals, while minimising adverse side-effects
 -like growing income differences both between people and between regions,
and the growing unemployed labour force,' he added. It was essential to
break down monopolies and encourage industrial competition, he added.
The Japanese side will propose that troubleshooting teams from western
companies and consultants work in selected enterprises for several months.
They would help to establish comprehensive corporate strategies, identify
equipment and skill needs, instil higher standards of cost-consciousness and
efficiency, and pinpoint the factory's most marketable and exportable
product mix, he said.
Robert Thomson adds from Tokyo: Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's newly appointed
foreign minister, said yesterday he felt a heavy responsibility as G7 summit
host next week, and would work for a fresh package of aid for Russia.
However, Tokyo would continue to link help for Russian reforms to the
Soviet-Japanese dispute over the Kurile Islands.

FT  08 APR 93 / Wellcome attacks Aids study as share price falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW erupted yesterday between the Medical Research Council and Wellcome,
the manufacturer of AZT, the Aids treatment, after the company attacked the
council's decision to publish preliminary data about the medicine's
effectiveness.
Mr John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, said preliminary data from a trial
published by the MRC last week were misleading. He attacked the publication
of the information in the medical journal The Lancet before it had been
reviewed by other leading specialists.
Yesterday's attempt to reassure the market, which included briefings for
city analysts, journalists and Aids activists, appeared to backfire as
Wellcome's shares fell 23p to 698p.
Since last Friday's announcement of the Anglo-French Concorde trial, which
claimed that AZT, Wellcome's second best-selling drug, did not delay the
onset of Aids in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients, the share price has
fallen by 8 per cent.
The MRC helped organise the trials. Wellcome told analysts and Aids pressure
groups yesterday that further analysis from the trial would show AZT was
effective. There was no question that the drug helped patients who developed
Aids, it added. AZT had sales of Pounds 131m in the six months to February
1993.
The company's claims were refuted by Professor Ian Weller, the Concorde
trial's principal UK investigator, who said Wellcome was manipulating the
data.
Professor Richard Peto, adviser to the Concorde study's clinical trials
unit, added: 'People should look at the numbers as presented by the
investigators, not as presented by drug companies. If they do that, then
it's clear these treatments are not of nearly as much value as originally
hoped.'
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research and development, insisted
AZT was effective in slowing the onset of Aids. He said there were five
studies other than the Concorde trial involving more than 3,000 patients -
some lasting two and a half years - that demonstrated death occurred half as
often in asymptomatic patients using AZT.
'For the MRC to suggest AZT does not work on the basis of one study and then
with only a few weeks of analysis - well I don't know why they're doing it,'
he said.
Dr Paul Fiddian, head of clinical virology at Wellcome, stressed the
Concorde study's data were preliminary and not easy to read. Some trial
patients on non-active dummy medicines had swapped during the middle of the
trial, he said.
Analysis had also been complicated because some patients had rightly been
given a new treatment that prevented a pneumonia that was the most common
cause of death in Aids patients.
Dr Jones called on the MRC to publish the full analysis as soon as possible.
Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the
leading UK Aids charity, took the MRC's side in the developing dispute with
Wellcome. He pointed out that the company had been very closely involved in
the design and management of the Concorde trial.
'It seems disingenuous for Wellcome now to criticise the design and data
analysis of a trial in which they were integrally involved,' Mr Partridge
said. 'We already knew AZT was limited in its effects and this trial has
clarified those limitations.'
Medical authorities in the US have been more supportive of AZT than in
Europe. Mr Mark Alampi, chief operations officer of Project Aids
International, in Los Angeles, said the National Institutes of Health 'has
been on a continuous campaign since last Friday telling people with HIV not
to stop taking AZT'.

FT  08 APR 93 / Top Fiat executive faces corruption probe
</HEADLINE>

   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's largest private company, was yesterday dragged deeper into the
country's spreading corruption scandals when a cautionary warrant was issued
by Milan magistrates against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating
officer.
The warrant for alleged corruption relates to the activities of Iveco,
Fiat's commercial vehicle subsidiary, and allegations of kick-backs on a
Milan municipal bus contract.
Mr Garuzzo, number three in the Fiat hierarchy after Mr Giovanni Agnelli,
the chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, chief executive officer, said last night
that the magistrates' action could be 'very damaging to the Fiat Group in
general and in particular Iveco, as our business is world-wide'.
Speaking from an undisclosed address in London, Mr Garuzzo said he had been
'most surprised' to hear about the warrant. 'I can only think that, as has
happened to a number of people recently, the Italian investigating
authorities prefer to hear from persons after they have been arrested,' he
said.
'Only last Thursday (April 1), and again the following day, I specifically
asked through my lawyer to be interviewed by the Public Prosecutor on
aspects I could assist in of their investigation into the affairs of Iveco.
'I was told they were not interested, even though by Tuesday they had my
request, in writing, to be heard.'
Mr Garuzzo is the fifth Fiat executive to be caught up in the
investigations. The legal moves against him mean the two key members of the
younger generation of senior Fiat management, promoted in a shake-up to
prepare for the departure next year of Mr Agnelli, have been implicated in
the corruption scandals.
The other executive, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial
officer, was arrested in February on charges of corruption. He was released
but the charges were not dropped.
They relate to L1.8bn (Pounds 745,000) paid by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's
construction subsidiary, during the building of the Milan metro.
Mr Garuzzo, 54, has been with Fiat since 1976 and ran Iveco in 1984. He
assumed responsibility for Fiat's industrial operations in November. Mr
Mattioli looked after the financial side of the business.

FT  08 APR 93 / Patten to review school testing: Boycott is still likely
after teaching unions give proposals a lukewarm reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN URGENT review of school testing and the national curriculum was announced
yesterday by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, in a last-ditch
attempt to avert the threatened boycott by teachers of compulsory tests.
Speaking at a conference in Cardiff of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers (ATL), he said that although 'testing is here to stay', the
national curriculum, together with its tests for seven, 11- and
14-year-olds, could be greatly simplified.
But with Mr Patten facing growing criticism from inside and outside the
Conservative party and with his proposals drawing a lukewarm response from
teachers' unions, the move seems to have done little to defuse the growing
political crisis now facing him over the issue.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, yesterday condemned Mr Patten's
proposals, insisting that he was making 'guinea pigs of our children'.
Mr Hugh Dykes, Conservative MP for Harrow East and an outspoken critic of
the school tests, yesterday described Mr Patten's announcement as
inadequate.
Two out of three of the largest teaching unions seem set to boycott the
compulsory English tests for 14-year-olds planned in England and Wales this
summer. The NASUWT, the second largest teachers' union, which has already
announced a boycott, said it would continue its action as planned.
The biggest union, the National Union of Teachers, which is due to vote on
Saturday on a ballot for a similar boycott, reiterated its opposition to the
tests.
'Mr Patten's statement takes us no further forward. The tests should be
abandoned,' the union said.
The ATL, one of the more moderate of the teaching unions, will decide today
whether to hold its own ballot. Although Mr Patten received a relatively
muted reception at the ATL conference, Mr Peter Smith, the union's general
secretary, yesterday noted that the outcome of today's ballot was now 'on a
knife-edge'.
If the ATL unites with the more radical unions over the issue, the
Department of Education will face a serious logistical challenge in staging
the tests.
The headmasters' union, the National Association of Head Teachers, has
already indicated that it would be unlikely to carry out the tests in the
face of widespread opposition from teachers.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT, said although Mr Patten's
statement was 'a modest step in the right direction' without wholesale
reform 'this year's industrial action will be repeated next year'.
The review announced by Mr Patten will consider:
Slimming down the national curriculum, which currently consists of 10
compulsory subjects for secondary school pupils.
Simplifying the unwieldy 10 point system used to assess attainment in these
subjects.
Streamlining the tests, and shifting the timing, to make them easier for
teachers to administer.
Improving the national curriculum's central administration.
Including more teacher representation on the new School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority, which is to be established to carry out the review.

FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays lending officer to leave after shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BARCLAYS senior executive whose department approved many of the poor
loans which led to a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss last year is to leave the
bank, it will be announced today.
Mr Mark Deverell is leaving as Barclays introduces a new structure to
control and balance its lending. The bank's reforms include the breaking-up
of the 'central advances department' which Mr Deverell has headed.
Barclays said yesterday that Mr Deverell, the 52-year-old director of risk
management, had 'agreed to leave'. He is the highest ranking casualty to
result from the growth in lending that followed a Pounds 921m rights issue
in 1988. Mr Deverell, former chief executive of Barclays' subsidiary in
Australia, took over risk management in 1989. The property lending, which
contributed to Pounds 1.96bn in UK bad debt provisions last year, rose
rapidly in 1989 and 1990.
Barclays' management has faced sustained criticism by investors. Mr Andrew
Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, has announced that Barclays
will appoint a new chief executive from outside the bank this year.
Mr Alan Brown, the director taking over responsibility for management of
lending, said Mr Deverell had set in train the review of loan controls that
led to both the breaking-up of his department and the abolition of his post.
'He was one of the people who suggested it, so there is no question of him
being a victim. But having helped create the new structure, it removes his
job,' said Mr Brown.
The bank will disclose its new structure for controlling risk - along with
Mr Deverell's departure from May - to its managers today. Mr Brown, 47,
formerly chief executive of Barclays in Japan, will take charge in the new
post of director of group credit policy.
He said he intended to reduce lending to property, construction and hotel
companies. He said executives had been too rushed by the growth of loans in
the late 1980s to balance the lending properly.
Mr Brown disclosed a series of changes in Barclays' structure for assessing
loans of more than Pounds 5m, and for ensuring that its lending portfolio is
balanced:
The central advances department - responsible for both loan approval and
portfolio management - will break up. Loans will be approved within banking
and investment banking divisions.
Mr Brown will head a new credit policy unit that will be responsible for
balancing lending, and ensuring the bank is not over-exposed in risky
sectors.
Loans of more than Pounds 5m will each be assigned to a single executive. He
or she will be responsible for making sure Barclays' risk is contained.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Millwall makes Pounds 3.2m rights to ensure
stadium completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLWALL Holdings, the USM-quoted football company, has launched a Pounds
3.2m rights issue to rescue its fortunes by ensuring the completion of a new
stadium, writes Jane Fuller.
The 3-for-2 issue, at 2p a share, represents a fresh start for the
loss-making club, which will become only one of the attractions at the new
20,000-seat arena.
The New London Stadium, which replaces The Den this summer, will be managed
by Ogden Entertainment Services, one of the US's largest venue operators.
Mr Reg Burr, Millwall's chairman, said the issue proceeds would bridge a gap
between the Pounds 11m already spent on the Senegal Fields development and
the Pounds 4m needed to complete it. 'Should the stadium not be completed,
the group would face serious financial difficulties.'
The bulk of the cash has come from selling The Den and in grants from
Lewisham Council and the Football Trust, leaving the company without debt.
It does, however, continue to lose money - Pounds 740,000 (Pounds 1.1m) in
the six months to November 30 on sales of Pounds 1m. This was offset by
Pounds 780,000 from player sales.
Millwall Holdings will change its name to New London Stadium to reflect the
fact that the club's 25 games will make up only a third of the programme.
Mr Frank E Russo Jnr, vice president of international operations for Ogden
Entertainment, said pop concerts, boxing, food festivals and religious
events would also take place.
Plentiful food, drink and other shopping opportunities were planned to
reverse the pattern of British sports stadia being 'focused on the pitch
instead of the customer. There should be value in going to the venue
regardless of the event.'
Ogden has also become involved with the new Manchester Victoria Station
arena.
Millwall plans to restore the potential for dividend payments by a capital
reduction exercise that will eliminate the deficit in its profit and loss
account.
Its share price slipped from 5p to 3 3/4 p yesterday.
The rights issue is underwritten by the brokers Townsley &amp; Co.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lord Boardman to head Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International, the property and trading group that is in the final
stages of a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring, has appointed Lord
Boardman as non-executive chairman.
Lord Boardman, a former chairman of National Westminster Bank - which is a
member of Heron's five-bank creditors steering committee - will take up his
post once the restructuring is complete.
The appointment of a new chairman to replace Mr Gerald Ronson, the company's
founder, was heralded last October when the company announced its outline
restructuring proposals.
Mr Ronson, who will remain as chief executive, said: 'I have worked with
Lord Boardman in the past and I am delighted that someone of his obvious
stature and experience will be joining the board as chairman.'
Heron said it would shortly be making an announcement to bondholders about
its refinancing. 'The restructuring process continues to proceed well,' it
said.
Final proposals on the restructuring, which involve the conversion of debt
to equity, were sent to the company's bankers in February.
The company also plans to appoint two new non-executive directors, who are
acceptable to the banks' steering committee and to bondholder
representatives.
The two existing non-executive directors, Mr Tony Royle and Mrs Gail Ronson,
will retire on completion of the restructuring.
Heron's restructuring talks originally began in March 1992, after a downturn
in its property portfolio and losses in its trading operations eroded its
assets to a deficit of some Pounds 225m at March 31 1992.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits dreams dashed at
Daimler-Benz - Christopher Price in Stuttgart outlines the strategy at
Daimler-Benz, where earnings are falling towards DM 1 bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION, ruinous price wars, cancelled aircraft orders, government defence
cuts and the costs of structural change conspired last year to dash
Daimler-Benz's dream of crashing through the DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) profits
barrier. Net earnings are still in reverse, falling towards DM1bn this year.
However, there was no need to panic, according to Mr Edzard Reuter, group
chairman. The group will roll ahead, complementing the strategic
restructuring started in the mid-1980s with some very painful short-term
measures.
Most of these are destined to bite into domestic operations, notably the
cornerstone vehicles business, which last year cast off 14,000 of its German
workers while other divisions shed 4,000.
Mercedes-Benz, which is planning to cut output by 70,000 vehicles this year,
will once again bear the brunt with a net loss of 15,000 jobs.
Long-term change will affect Mercedes more than other divisions. Production
is being steadily shifted out of Germany into new overseas factories which
are both closer to customers and cheaper to man than domestic plants.
'We are internationalising our group, not only at every stage of purchasing,
production and sales but also in research and design, in public relations
work and among our leading staff,' Mr Reuter said.
'By no means does this imply that we have packed our bags and are ready to
leave Germany tomorrow.' One aim was to escape from the circumstances which
led to last year's disappointments which followed spring forecasts of
profits over DM2bn.
The European market failed to live up to expectations of a revival. It
relapsed into stagnation and recession. Then a collapse in public sector
demand was compounded by chaos in the European exchange rate mechanism, he
said.
The group was trying to escape the clutches of Germany's peculiar business
and political climate. The recent federal budget, for example, meant that
the group's defence business would lose about DM1bn in sales this year.
The government, he complained, was trying to cut spending 'without any
rational concept of how to do so prudently . . . all their efforts appear to
hinge more on grabbing and hanging on to votes.'
In the US, the reopening of the Airbus subsidies issue threatened the core
and expanding aircraft divisions with a trade war.
Efforts to merge AEG's railway interests with those of Siemens were blocked
by a narrow-minded federal cartel office. German trust laws were in
desperate need of overhaul, Mr Reuter said.
Daimler has acted to escape from the narrow and over-burdened German capital
markets with plans for a listing later this year on the New York Stock
Exchange.
'Germany's suitability as a location for business and industry is being
questioned increasingly,' Mr Reuter said. 'German companies are said to have
lost their international lead in technology. Our entire society, the
reasoning goes, has lost its ability to act as one, which throws up barriers
we cannot seem to overcome.
'Parties and politicians are being stamped as incompetent and denounced as
irresponsible, while the media are viewed as the root of all evil.'
There was some truth to these beliefs, Mr Reuter said, but Daimler was not a
company given to snap judgments and cavalier attitudes.

<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the French state-owned military electronics company, yesterday
announced a big drop in net profit to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 277m) last year from
FFr2.34bn the previous year, and a small cut in its dividend to FFr6 a share
from FFr6.80.
The 35 per cent fall in profits was on a smaller decline in turnover, which
dropped by 2.8 per cent to FFr34.2bn. Its financial results were dragged
down by a 15.5 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which
last week reported provisions and a loss amounting to FFr1.8bn.
Thomson-CSF's share of that loss was FFr256m, against a FFr556m profit a
year earlier.
Mr Alain Gomez, Thomson-CSF president, yesterday forecast this year's result
should not be any worse than last year's, 'with a probability, which is not
negligible, that it will be better'.
This prediction appeared to be based on the hope of a better performance
from financial investments. These include a stake in Althus Finance which
provided Thomson-CSF with a profit of FFr613m last year, up from FFr225m in
1991. Mr Gomez said contraction of defence budgets gave no reason to expect
an upturn this year in military business.
By contrast, Dassault Aviation, the French aircraft maker, yesterday
announced a higher net profit for 1992 - FFr180m - than it had previously
signalled. It said it would double its dividend to FFr6 a share. Last month,
Dassault executives had predicted that net profit last year would be about
the same as the FFr103m in 1991. The company said cost-cutting had helped
lift profits more than it had expected.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is prepared to consider separately the oilseed part of the US-EC farm
trade accord, a spokesman for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
'We can find a separate arrangement (on oilseeds) from the rest of the
accord. That doesn't mean we will simply give in,' he said after a meeting
between Mr Balladur and French farm union leaders.
But he said the French government remained firmly opposed to the global
Blair House farm trade agreement struck in Washington last November.
'We are not giving in on the global farm deal,' he said.
Mr Balladur asked farm leaders to see him again on May 7, ahead of a meeting
of EC foreign affairs ministers scheduled for May 10.
After the meeting French farm leaders said they were reassured by the new
government's willingness to tackle farm issues seriously, although there was
no mention during the meeting of a veto of the deal.
'I am convinced of the new government's seriousness but I am not capable of
judging its decisions,' said Mr Pierre Cormoreche, president of the
permanent assembly of agricultural chambers (APCA).
Before France's elections at the end of March, the then opposition leader Mr
Jacques Chirac declared that he would take a firm line on Gatt even if it
meant sparking a crisis in the EC.
The US-EC farm deal is seen as one of the keys to a Gatt Uruguay Round
agreement.
France's former Socialist government had threatened to veto the oilseed deal
as well as the global farm trade accord.
If accepted by EC states, the accord would limit the EC's oilseed area to
5.13m hectares and cut by 21 per cent the volume of its subsidised farm
exports.

FT  07 APR 93 / French debate central bank's regulatory role
</HEADLINE>

FRANCE'S debate on how to give its central bank autonomy in setting monetary
policy - as required by the Maastricht treaty - has got under way with the
Banque de France and the powerful Tresor department of the finance ministry
taking opposing sides on the future of the central bank's other roles in
regulating commercial banks, their solvency and liquidity.
In a banking newsletter, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de
France, said he saw no reason to change the present system in which the
Commission Bancaire, with the aid and close supervision of the Banque de
France, controls commercial banks. 'The central bank regulates the liquidity
of the banking system, which gives it (the central bank) a crucial
importance in tracking the performance of commercial banks,' he said.
Even in Germany, where supervision of commercial banks formally lies with an
office in Berlin separate from the Bundesbank, the German central bank had a
department which keeps an eye on the banking sector.
By contrast, officials at the Tresor have been quoted in the press as
suggesting that, if France does not adapt the German system, the Banque de
France might find itself faced with a conflict of interest. If, for
instance, the central bank, as lender of last resort, had to provide
emergency liquidity to a commercial bank in trouble, it might undermine its
own monetary policy.
Any paring down of the Banque de France also worries leaders of the central
bank's 18,000 employees. They have sought - and won - from Mr de Larosiere
assurances that he will try to maintain the central bank's role.
Many of the key elements - such as the security of tenure for board members
of an independent central bank - are set in the treaty of Maastricht, and
are therefore in the brief which the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur,
last Friday gave his finance minister, Mr Edmond Alphandery, to prepare a
draft statute on the Banque de France's future.
On Friday, Mr Balladur spoke of giving the Banque de France 'a very broad
autonomy'. The fact that he did not use the word 'independence' has been
interpreted by some as indicating that he intends to let the central bank
keep a banking supervision role, which in contrast to the area of monetary
policy, would still be subject to government influence.

FT  07 APR 93 / Danes to press for EC law on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH presidency of the EC yesterday made clear its determination to
push for the setting up of mandatory works councils in large trans-European
companies.
This is one of the Community's most controversial pieces of draft social
legislation.
After talks among employment and social affairs ministers, it became clear
that Britain - the only member state opposing the measure - will have to
fight to dilute its content, or see it passed by its 11 partners, assuming
that the Maastricht treaty and its social protocol come into force later
this year.
If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies
would still be among those most affected. According to British calculations,
more than 100 UK companies have operations in continental Europe which are
large enough to fall under the requirements of the directive for their
operations outside Britain.
If the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 companies would be
affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than France.
Denmark wants agreement among the 11 by June, in an effort to demonstrate to
its sceptical voters that the EC can deliver social standards comparable to
its own. If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did from
the Maastricht social chapter, the works council requirements would go
through without the British if and when the treaty is ratified.
If Denmark itself ratifies Maastricht in its referendum on May 18, the works
council issue could itself become embroiled in the tangled process of
British parliamentary ratification of the treaty.
The directive would oblige companies employing more than 1,000 workers in
more than one of the EC's 12 member states, and with more than 100 employees
in at least two of them, to set up elected works councils. They would have
to be consulted on issues such as job changes, new technology and investment
plans and relocation of business.
During the recent controversies over alleged 'job poaching' in the
relocation to the UK of production by Hoover in Burgundy and Digital from
the west of Ireland, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, pledged a new effort to get the works councils directive into EC
law.
The Commission believes cases like Hoover and Digital would be less
inflammatory with obligatory consultation of the workforce, denying
companies the chance to play one set of employees off against another.

FT  07 APR 93 / Italian new car sales plunge by 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in Italy, Europe's second biggest market, were down almost 21
per cent last month compared with March last year. Demand was hit by the
recession and price rises for some imports.
The 20.8 per cent plunge in March sales to 189,940 units was the eighth
monthly fall since August.
The decline is likely to rekindle friction between domestic and Japanese
manufacturers which have increased sales. Sales by Nissan soared 90 per cent
to 4,372 from 2,301 in March 1992 thanks largely to new models from the
group's UK plant. Honda sales rose by nearly 9 per cent, while Toyota rose
fractionally.
Japanese exports and transplants still account for less than 5 per cent of
the market. However last week's agreement between the European Community and
Japan on import levels for this year, which allowed a 17.5 per cent rise in
Japanese exports in Italy, was criticised by some motor industry executives.
The drop brings Italian car sales into line with trends in Germany, France
and Spain, where demand for cars has fallen heavily recently.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission believes the single European market could lose
momentum and credibility unless new ways are found to build on the
achievements of the past seven years.
Commissioners spent most of yesterday discussing how to develop the internal
market and to boost European business and industry.
A spokesman said the Commission was concerned at the way the single market -
aimed at easing the movement of people, goods, services and capital across
EC frontiers - was no longer seen as an important issue across the
Community.
Commissioners stressed the first aim was to adopt the few measures
outstanding from the original 1985 single market programme, which is 95 per
cent complete, and to make sure that what had been adopted was implemented
and functioning properly.
At the same time, the Community should press for the lifting of remaining
controls on travellers at internal EC borders, politically the most
sensitive of the single market objectives and the most difficult to achieve.
The EC's executive is itself seeking new purpose in the aftermath of the
symbolic single market 'deadline' of January 1, 1993.

FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early rise falters in a drab market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT confidence suffered a fresh blow on the UK stock market yesterday
when Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment group, added to the
uncertainty hanging over the pharmaceuticals sector by announcing that it
was ceasing development of an asthma treatment project. The news compounded
the general discomfiture in the market, which abandoned an early attempt to
recapture the Footsie 2,850 mark to close several points easier on the
session.
It was a drab day for equities, with weakness in stock index futures also
undermining sentiment. Shares opened firmly, helped by a better performance
from Wall Street overnight, but the Footsie peaked at 2,850.1 when stock
index futures opened lower. The June contract on the Footsie lost its
nearest support level and remained lower throughout the day.
Renewed pressure on BAT Industries, as UK analysts weighed the implications
of the cigarette price war opened by Philip Morris, of the US, also
depressed the mood.
The Fisons news was taken very badly. 'This is a major blow to Fisons - very
bad news indeed,' summed up the general view. While some see Fisons as a bid
prospect now, others took yesterday's news as yet another blow to a
pharmaceuticals sector which has grossly underperformed the broader market
this year.
At worst, the market was down by 10.2 on the FT-SE 100 scale at 2,828.6. A
modest recovery set in when the Dow Average came in with an early gain of 12
in the new Wall Street session but there was little change in sentiment.
Scant attention was paid to the announcement of improved UK car sales in
March.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,832.2 with a loss of 6.6 on
the session. Traders sounded disheartened by the day's performance, which
revived fears that the UK equity market, having run ahead strongly at the
beginning of the year, must now await more convincing evidence of economic
recovery if it is to justify its current ratings.
Seaq volume improved slightly to 538.4m shares, after Monday's 438.7m that
produced retail business worth just above the Pounds 1bn total which has
become the lowest level acceptable to the London-based securities industry.
The unimpressive performance by the blue chip leaders was mirrored by that
of the second liners. At a final reading of 3,087.4, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
was off 3.4. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up about 66 per cent of
total equity volume yesterday, just above recent daily averages.
There were signs that investors were returning to the policy of moving into
solid yielding defensive stocks - water issues provided one of the few firm
sectors. Store shares, on the other hand, slipped lower as the chances of a
cut in UK base rates appeared as distant as ever. Only a move to reduce
rates in Germany can now set the stage for lower base rates, according to
analysts in the London market. For the present, UK equities have distanced
themselves from the firmness shown both by sterling and UK government bonds.
Strong gains in oil shares, ascribed to US buying, had mixed implications
for the UK stock market, which has largely taken a negative stance on the
sector.

FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another forecast that the dividend may be cut at Forte unsettled the shares
yesterday, when Smith New Court became the latest broking house to predict a
payment reduction with next week's results.
The house now estimates that the full-year dividend will be 5p, compared
with last year's 9.91p, joining company with NatWest Securities, long-term
bears at 5.5p, Hoare Govett, recent converts to 6.3p, and Paribas at 5p.
Ironically, in view of recent events at Queens Moat Houses, a dividend cut
by Forte would be interpreted as a positive move by the market. 'In a
difficult hotel environment, Forte will look prudent if it reduces its
dividend,' said one leisure analyst. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 177 1/2 p,
although turnover was a meagre 1.3m.
An early attempt by BAT Industries to rally was undermined in late trading.
Agency broker James Capel became the latest house to alter its stance,
changing its recommendation from hold to weak hold following the Philip
Morris decision to spark a price war in the US. BAT shares fell a net 5 to
880p.
International conglomerate BTR had a busy session as talk that the company
may soon announce a big disposal did the rounds. At the day's best, the
shares were 9 better at 619p, but surrendered that gain on profit-taking to
close unchanged at 610p, after trade of 4.8m.
The slump in the Fisons share price was the latest in a series of damaging
blows to the market and was seen by some dealers as a signal for a more
aggressive approach in switching into the highly defensive areas of the
market, notably the utilities.
British Gas settled 4 higher at 307 1/2 p. The electricity stocks were well
supported, helped by a recent flurry of broker buy recommendations, as were
the water stocks, but customer business in both areas was minimal with only
Severn Trent able to boast turnover in excess of 1m shares. Severn closed 4
firmer at 527p.
Activity in the power generators was on larger scale with broker Hoare
Govett forecasting dividend growth rates of 14.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent
for National Power in the next two years and 15.2 per cent and 12.4 per cent
for PowerGen. The latter settled 5 up at 350p and the former 3 better at
348p.
There was renewed speculation that Rank Organisation had struck a deal to
sell its provincial hotels with a price of Pounds 57m being suggested. The
15 hotels have been for sale for a year and rumours of their imminent
disposal have been rife since January. Analysts hinted that several
interested parties had been in negotiations with Rank, but the favourite
scenarios are a management buy-out, or a move from a Far Eastern group said
to have been scouring the UK hotel market recently. A Singapore group
purchased the Gloucester hotel from Rank in November for Pounds 67.5m. Rank
shares fell 3 to 666p.
Good results from City Centre helped the shares gain 2 to 85p and reflected
well on Bass, up a penny at 551p. Switching from Guinness to Grand
Metropolitan left the former 9 adrift at 478p and the latter 2 stronger at
426p.
Results from Tesco came largely in line with expectations and with a mildly
positive meeting with analysts, the shares closed a penny firmer at 232p.
However, specialists said that the company failed to satisfy the bears of
the stock worried about the long-term strategy for growth.
There were more downgrades at Unilever as meetings with analysts continued.
Most cuts have been on currency considerations. The shares fell 19 to 1144p.
Wellcome recovered 16 to 721p ahead of briefings to analysts today in the
UK. The company is busily carrying out a belated damage limitation exercise
following worries over its anti-AIDS drug AZT or Retrovir and will discuss
its plan to seek regulatory approval for wider use of the drug.
Shares in UK airports operator BAA, eased 12 to 788p,with Cazenove said to
have downgraded profit expectations.
Trailer rental and leasing company TIP Europe jumped 15 to 40 1/2 p after
announcing an agreed bid from a subsidiary of General Electric of the US.
There was talk that the move could lead to greater competition for Tiphook
which fell 25 to 335p.
In motors, several stocks were boosted by the news of a 12.7 per cent year
on year rise in UK car sales for March. Thomas Cowie put on 3 at 211p,
Dagenham Motor hardened 2 to 108p, ahead of figures today, while Lex Service
also added 2 at 341p. International trading group Inchcape, owner of several
UK car dealerships, rose 8 to 593p.
The encouraging statement to shareholders at BICC's annual meeting saw the
stock race up to 361p before closing a net 8 better at 358p.
A broker's suggestion that MB Caradon could be targetting Redland's bricks
business, substantially enlarged by Redland's acquisition of Steetley last
year, saw Redland move up 6 to 429p on good turnover of 1.3m shares.

FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong buying of oil shares on Wall Street overnight followed through into
London, where US houses were aggressive buyers of the majors. The latest
burst of US support for the sector again unnerved big UK institutions, which
for the most part are underweight in the sector, especially in BP.
US broking houses have been steadfast supporters of the UK oil majors for
many months, focusing particularly on the recovery potential at BP. The
latter's shares were the sixth best performer in the FT-SE 100 during the
first quarter of the year, outperforming the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index by
18.3 per cent. BP took the honours yesterday, just managing to outpace
Shell. BP closed 5 up at 306 1/2 p on 8.3m traded, while Shell rose 9 to 586
1/2 p.
An element of uncertainty was injected, however, after Kuwait warned fellow
Opec members that abuses of oil output quotas could lead to Kuwait lifting
its production. The threat drove crude oil prices lower in London.
Burmah Castrol shares suffered turbulence, caused by the placing by Cazenove
of a block of 4.5m shares (2 1/2 per cent of the enlarged issued capital) at
705p apiece to help fund its acquisition from ICI of Tribol, the industrial
lubricants manufacturer. The placing was said to have been oversubscribed 2
1/2 times. 'The deal looks sound and sensible and fits in neatly with
Burmah's current strategy,' said one analyst.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT that Fisons was withdrawing from one of its key development
products prompted the troubled pharmaceuticals company's shares to fall
sharply yesterday. The setback in the shares cast serious doubts over the
near-term outlook for the company, and for its future independence.
The decision to halt development of Tipredane, its anti-asthma product,
leaves Fisons with only one drug in the Phase Two development stage and
without any apparent prospects for good news. It would appear to set the
seal on the company's profits warning last June which prompted the City to
revalue the company by some Pounds 690m.
In spite of a brief fillip at Christmas when the US Food and Drug
Administration gave its approval to Tilade, another anti-asthma treatment,
the shares have never properly recovered. Yesterday's slide of 25 to 169p on
hefty turnover of 18m shares left Fisons dangerously close to the bottom of
the Footsie in terms of market capitalisation.
The news surprised analysts, who said only last week that they were told of
Tipredane's exciting prospects at a drug conference. The turnround revived
old bid talk, with Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals arm of ICI, touted as a
possible predator. However, hostile bids have not been a feature of the
health sector and Zeneca, when it is demerged from ICI, is likely to have
its own worries. Analysts said a fire sale of Fisons' assets might be more
likely.

FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LACK of strong economic or political features to inspire traders saw the
futures contract fall through what many had considered its resistance level,
writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 followed the familiar path
traced over the past few sessions. It opened at 2,854, and it had risen to
2,868 by mid-morning, which turned out to be the high of the day.
But with the early shoppers soon satisfied, the contract found few other
takers and drifted lower thereafter, falling through the 2,855 mark, a level
which many market traders had considered to be a support point for the June
contract.
The afternoon only brought a further decline and the early weakness on Wall
Street saw June fall to the day's low of 2,836.
Bargain hunters finally took the opportunity of buying at the lower levels,
which lifted June out of the doldrums, helping it to a close of 2,845, a
decline of 10 from the previous session but around 4 points above fair value
premium to cash of about 11. Turnover dropped to 5,828 contracts.
However, the volume in the traded options showed a substantial improvement
from Monday's poor figure, reaching 29,191 lots by the official close. Some
9,298 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, while dealings in
Hillsdown totalled 2,841, making it the most active of the stock options.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed ahead of
inflation data

Wall Street
MIXED trading patterns surfaced yesterday, with losses in the consumer
products sector countered by gains in oil and motor shares, writes Nikki
Tait in New York.
However, by the close, the former trend dominated, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was showing a modest 1.62-point loss at 3,377.57, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index was 1.13 easier at 441.16. The Nasdaq
composite index, which measures the over-the-counter market, fell more
heavily, by 6.57 to 664.14, largely because of a number of very weak stocks,
with few positive situations to offset their impact.
Trading volume on the New York SE was 291.7m shares, while declines
outweighed advances by a small margin.
In terms of general economic trends, the stock market remains focused on the
inflation numbers due to be released on Thursday and Friday, and it paid
little attention to yesterday's wholesale sales figures, or to the big
carmakers' relatively cheerful March sales data released on Monday
afternoon.
But many of the larger consumer products companies continued to drift lower,
as investors fretted about the strength of 'brand loyalties' generally - a
concern triggered by Philip Morris's decision to defend the market share
position of its best-selling Marlboro label at an enormous cost to profits.
Coca-Cola, for example, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 , while
PepsiCo, its big soft drinks rival, lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 40.
Colgate-Palmolive was Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at Dollars 60 and Procter &amp;
Gamble slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 .
In the tobacco sector itself, Philip Morris continued to lose ground,
dropping Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 . RJR Nabisco eased a further
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 , while American Brands gave up Dollars 1/8 at
Dollars 29 7/8 .
Wal-Mart Stores, the top-selling US retailer, shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 27
3/4 in fairly heavy trading. There have been worries recently that the
company may not be able to sustain its phenomenal growth record.
Many medical shares were sliding. US Surgical dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to
Dollars 48 3/4 . Broker Hambrecht &amp; Quist downgraded its rating on the stock
to 'hold' from 'buy'.
In the auto sector, the three Detroit manufacturers put on a strong
performance in the aftermath of Monday's sales figures. General Motors
gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 38 3/8 , Chrysler Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 41
and Ford Dollars 2 at Dollars 54.
Oil issues, meanwhile, continued to build on Monday's gains during the
morning session, although some of the advances had been shed by the close.
However, Chevron ended Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 84 3/8 and Exxon up
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 67 5/8 .
Turner Broadcasting 'B' rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 on reports that
Time Warner and Tele-Communications - both big shareholders in Turner - may
divide the company's assets.
However, Corning, the first major company to issue first-quarter earnings
figures, hardly got the reporting season off to an auspicious start. The New
York State-based glass company saw its shares slip Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
32 1/4 on news that the quarter's profits before extraordinary items were
down from Dollars 65m to Dollars 47.2m.
Canada
TORONTO closed flat to slightly lower after heavy trading, dragged down by a
decline among gold shares. The TSE 300 index dipped 5.5 to 3,598.8 and
volume amounted to 55.1m shares valued at CDollars 434.3m.
Half of the 14 sub-group indices lost ground, with golds shedding 1.3 per
cent following a weakening in the bullion price, which closed USDollars 1.50
down at USDollars 337.55 an ounce in New York. The transportation group had
the day's biggest rise, of 1.0 per cent.

<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES gave way to profit-taking by financial institutions, and the
Nikkei average lost ground for the first time in four trading days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index shed 272.66 to 19,486.80, after rising by 6.3 per cent during the
previous three days. It opened at the day's best of 19,748.92 and
profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling pushed it down to a low for the
session of 19,386.71.
Volume fell to 720m shares from 1.19bn, as dealers and foreigners took to
the sidelines. Declines led advances by 704 to 348, with 129 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 21.88 to
1,529.47, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.10 to 1,197.69.
Some brokers welcomed the fall, adding that the market was overheating.
Foreign investors were seen purchasing shares, while domestic institutions
remain net sellers. 'We expect to keep our money in cash for a while,'
commented one Japanese fund manager. However, traders said overall sentiment
remained firm. 'The consensus is that the market will continue to advance,'
said Baring Securities.
Electric power issues were the worst performers of the day, declining 4.24
per cent on profit-taking. Tokyo Electric Power showed some resistance to
the trend, losing just Y10 to Y4,090. Gas utilities were also weak, the
sector dropping 3.43 per cent.
Brokerage shares, which led the recent rally on hopes of better earnings due
to higher market volumes, receded on profit-taking. Nomura Securities
finished Y70 down at Y2,180 and Daiwa Securities Y50 off at Y1,340.
High technology issues were lower, with Toshiba down Y15 to Y720 and Fujitsu
falling Y11 to Y650. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone weathered profit-taking
and advanced Y40,000 to Y1.04m. Telecom-related shares were also popular,
with Fujikura appreciating Y67 to Y1,030 and Nippon Comsys adding Y50 at
Y1,270.
Reports of a gold vein discovery boosted Dowa Mining, which ended Y31 ahead
at Y667. However, Mitsui Mining and Smelting, which had been strong on
higher gold prices, lost momentum, closing Y1 easier at Y520; Sumitomo Metal
Mining weakened Y18 to Y826.
Fishery and drug stocks were sought as laggards relative to the Nikkei's
rise. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical put on Y50 at Y2,350 and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical Y40 at Y1,620.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 258.85 to 21,167.44 in volume of 34.7m
shares. Increasing cautiousness prompted light profit-taking.
Roundup
SOME strong performances were seen on the Pacific Rim, although trading was
punctuated by market closures. Bangkok was on holiday yesterday, celebrating
Chakri Day, while Bombay remained closed to facilitate settlement.
SINGAPORE posted its third consecutive record close, analysts believing that
the market has every chance of maintaining its momentum. The Straits Times
Industrial index gained 9.96 at 1,710.78, having peaked at an intraday
all-time high of 1,711.40. Volume, however, shrank to 254.72m shares from
Monday's record 426.76m.
The rise came as the latest quarterly investment review from Merrill Lynch,
the US investment house, recommended investors to increase their weightings
for Singapore.
Malaysian stocks traded over the counter were said to be consolidating
recent gains.
MANILA was also firm, with prices extending Monday's rally on the law giving
President Fidel Ramos special legislative powers to tackle the country's
energy crisis. The composite index moved ahead 13.98 to 1,529.38, for a
two-day advance of 3.21 per cent.
Buying was mostly selective with volume thin. Investors were aggressive in
purchasing San Miguel 'B' shares, which are open for purchase by Filipinos
and foreigners, pushing the price up to 142 pesos from the previous 140.
SEOUL saw heavy demand by institutional and foreign investors for
large-capitalisation shares, taking the comp-osite index forward 7.87 to
697.11 as turnover expanded to Won673.74bn.
AUSTRALIA languished as investors became cautious ahead of the Easter break.
The All Ordinaries index lost 12.2 to 1,658.3, the lowest close since a
post-election plunge left it at 1,626.4 on March 15.
Speculative trade boosted volume in miners, although diamond miner Striker
Resources dipped 2 cents to 12 cents with 1.42m shares changing hands.
HONG KONG encountered profit-taking by local investors which brought the
Hang Seng index 63.61 down to 6,340.83 in turnover of HKDollars 2.46bn.
Emperor International Holdings' rights issue and placement totalling
HKDollars 377m left the shares 20 cents, or 27 per cent, weaker at 53 cents.
Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa met selling pressure on fears of possible
cash calls. Cheung Kong fell 40 cents to HKDollars 22.20 and Hutchison eased
10 cents to HKDollars 17.10.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated after early gains to close mixed on profit-taking,
which left the composite index 0.24 lower at 655.89. Volume of 577.81m
shares compared with Monday's record 884.14m.
South Africa was closed for a public holiday.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover after four
days of decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE broadly-based gain in bourses yesterday followed four days of decline,
and coincided with hopes of interest rate cuts in a number of capitals,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ended just short of its best after late arbitrage buying reinforced
the positive effect of firmer bonds and the franc's rise to a one-month high
against the D-Mark. The CAC-40 index rose 20.65, or 1.05 per cent to
1,995.33 in turnover of about FFr2.2bn.
It was not all one-way traffic. Carrefour, the hypermarket retailer, rose
FFr63 to FFr2698 up after its March sales figures showed a rise of 12.9 per
cent. However, Pechiney International, in packaging and aeronautical parts,
fell FFr10.50 to FFr220.50 on an 11 per cent drop in 1992 operating profits.
Looking ahead, Alcatel rose FFr9 to FFr671 on expectations of a 12 per cent
rise in net profits today. A drop in Thomson-CSF profits came after the
market closed, and the shares ended only 70 centimes down at FFr166.50.
FRANKFURT balanced a firmer bond market, and buying of BMW and Volkswagen
against poor results and prospects from Daimler. The DAX index closed 6.71
higher at 1,665.40 as turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM5.9bn.
Daimler dropped 2.4 per cent as its DVFA earnings fell from DM55.40 a share
to DM29.60 for 1992. The shares closed DM14.50 lower at DM580.50 with
Mercedes, still closing the gap which will disappear when the two companies
are merged, DM10.50 down at DM564.
BMW and VW rose by DM4.90 to DM315.90, and DM14 to DM488 respectively. There
was a theory that with the amalgamation of Mercedes stock, investors will
want to reduce potentially overweight Daimler holdings and plump for the
other two majors instead.
In steels, Thyssen rose DM4.50 to DM179, following recent strength in Krupp
Hoesch, on a blue skies view of recovery prospects if the German steel
industry is restructered, perhaps into only three major suppliers.
AMSTERDAM, looking to Germany to give an interest rate lead, moved ahead
although trading was thin and small deals were enough to lift prices. The
CBS Tendency index added 1.3 to 108.0.
Chemical stocks were bought partly on options-related interest, with DSM
rising Fl 2.60 to Fl 87.20 and Akzo up Fl 1.90 to Fl 150.50. Unilever was
the only blue-chip to end lower, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 209.10 amid rumours
that some UK brokerages have downgraded the stock.
Pakhoed, the tank storage company, fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 38.60 after a drop in
1992 earnings and a forecast of lower profits for 1993.
MILAN saw renewed buying by foreign investors and short-covering by domestic
traders ahead of the Easter weekend. The Comit index rose 6.98 to 485.55.
Mutual funds data for March, which showed a net inflow of L358bn into
equities after February's L15bn outflow, also boosted sentiment.
Blue chips were among the main beneficiaries. Fiat fixed L30 lower at L5,670
but firmed to L5,790 on the kerb while Generali fixed L410 higher at L33,700
and rose to L34,475 after-hours. Pirelli added L32 to L1,371 in response to
Monday's sale of its stake in Continental.
Telecommunications stocks continued to be bolstered by plans to restructure
the sector and privatisation candidates were also firm.
ZURICH moved back into record territory with investors encouraged by lower
money market rates and the firmer tone of the dollar. The SMI index rose
12.1 to an all-time high of 2,196.0.
The general mood improved by an inflation rate of 3.6 per cent while lower
interest rates helped the banks.
MADRID extended its gentle downward correction to a fifth day, the general
index closing 0.60 lower at 236.68 against a year's high of 241.50 a week
earlier. One Madrid trader said that political concerns about the ruling
Socialist party are beginning to weigh on Spain's equity and bond markets.
BRUSSELS closed off its mid-afternoon highs as the oil major, Petrofina,
which rose 2.5 per cent in mid-afternoon on takeover speculation, saw a late
sell-off which limited the gain to BFr180, or 1.7 per cent at BFr8,980.
The Bel-20 index closed 10.79 higher at 1,266.83. Petrofina was boosted by
plans to narrow its stake declaration threshhold from 5 to 3 per cent, soon
after news that the French oil group, Elf Aquitaine, had bought a stake of
less than 5 per cent.
VIENNA went back on the upgrade, the ATX index rising 9.28, or 1.2 per cent
to 778.31 although traders said that the rise was mainly technical, and in
thin volume.
OSLO rose 1.5 per cent, helped by lower interest rates and strength in the
dollar against the Norwegian crown, the all-share index closing 6.73 higher
at 447.79 in turnover of NKr254.4m.
HELSINKI saw continued strong gains in Nokia, the technology group, FM6
higher at FM148 following Monday's news of a large order from Germany. The
Hex index rose 17.8, or 1.7 per cent to 1,048.7, up 25 per cent in local
currency terms this year.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Turkey sets another record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ISTANBUL continued its record-breaking ways, closing 3 per cent higher
yesterday for a cumulative rise of 19.2 per cent since Monday of last week.
The market index climbed 196.47 to its third consecutive all-time peak of
6,740.58.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London said that the strong performance was
the result of a big inflow of cash as investors returned after the Ramadan
holiday.
He added that the market's gains this year followed moves to lower
short-term interest rates as the government attempted to lengthen the
maturity of its debt.
Equity investments had also benefited from new favourable tax treatment for
mutual funds which kept more than 25 per cent of their investments in
shares.
The new investable index price series on emerging markets from the
International Finance Corporation show that, in dollar terms, a 9.2 per cent
fall in March still left the Turkish market with a 32.1 per cent gain for
the first three months of this year.

FT  07 APR 93 / Money Markets: An easier atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS an easier atmosphere in European cash and futures markets
yesterday after the Bundesbank announced that it would be offering wholesale
funds to commercial banks this week at variable rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank said that it would offer a variable rate repurchase agreement
 -or repo - in this week's tenders for 14 days and 35 days. The lowest
accepted rate last week was for 8.17 per cent. There were strong
expectations that the rate would be shaved to around 8.10 per cent this
morning, or even to 8.05 per cent.
News of the variable rate offer had a positive effect on German cash and
futures markets. The interest rate on German call money dropped to about
8.15 per cent, helped by adequate reserves among German banks.
Euromark contracts were higher right across the board. The June contract
rose 7 basis points on the day to close at 92.84, while the September
contract also gained 7 basis points, ending at 93.74.
In spite of this more optimistic mood, there was talk that some banks might
offer to buy funds at comparatively high rates to be sure of getting
adequate liquidity. This is only the second month of the Bundesbank's new
and less rigid minimum reserve requirements and some banks are concerned not
to fall foul of the new arrangements.
The announcement of the variable rate repo had a positive effect on French
franc markets.
One-month French francs fell from about 10.25 per cent at the start of the
day to 10 per cent by the close. Three-month money also declined, from
around 9.75 per cent to about 9.5 per cent, bringing the spread between
three-month D-Marks and three-month French francs down to 156 basis points.
The June French franc futures contract finished 2 basis points higher on the
day at 91.80. There are strong expectations that the Bank of France will
bring down the interest rate on its 5 to 10-day lending window, currently at
12 per cent, tomorrow.
Cash rates in the sterling money markets softened again on an easier day in
the discount market. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 850m.
Three-month deposit rates closed at around 5 7/8 per cent, having been at 5
15/16 per cent on Monday night.

FT  07 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weaker on rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK was weaker against the dollar and most European currencies
yesterday amid expectations that the Bundesbank would cut the rate at which
it offers wholesale funds to commercial banks in its weekly money market
operation, writes James Blitz.
The German central bank yesterday announced a variable rate repurchase
agreement - or repo - in this week's tenders. The lowest accepted rate last
week was 8.17 per cent and there were strong expectations yesterday that the
rate would be cut today to 8.10 per cent or lower.
Poorer than expected economic indicators in Germany also raised expectations
that the Bundesbank would veer on the side of easing monetary policy today.
The unemployment level in western Germany in March rose by an adjusted
70,000 last month when the market had been expecting a 45,000 increase.
Industrial orders for February were down 2.2 per cent on the month, when the
market had been expecting a small net rise.
After drifting lower against the German currency on Monday, the dollar
closed yesterday a touch stronger. It ended in London at DM1.6125, up nearly
1 3/4 pfennigs. In New York it closed at DM1.6108.
However, some analysts continued to be bearish for the US currency in the
medium term.
The economics team at James Capel in London said the dollar's bull run is at
an end for the time being. Their economists suggest that the recent break
through the DM1.60 level should lead to a sell-off to DM1.54 and, if this
level fails to hold, to DM1.51.
However, they also believe the prospect of higher US inflation in the second
half of 1993 might lead to higher short-term US interest rates and a rise to
DM1.80 by the year-end.
The prospects of lower German rates also gave another lift to the French
franc, which broke through the FFr3.39 level against the D-Mark in the
European morning and spent much of the day on firm ground. The franc
finished in London at FFr3.384 from a previous close of FFr3.391.
Some dealers reported that the Bank of France had intervened in the market,
buying the French currency when it looked set to break through critical
chart points.
Overall, however, the franc was underpinned by expectations that the French
authorities would cut official interest rates tomorrow, when the Bank of
France operates in the money market, depending on how much the Bundesbank
eases policy today.
The Italian lira performed more strongly against the D-Mark in the European
afternoon after being pushed towards the L996 level by the continuing
political turmoil in Italy. The Italian currency closed at L988.9 from a
previous L993.0
Sterling also enjoyed a strong performance against the D-Mark, ending 1 1/2
pfennigs up at DM2.4425.

FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Whisper of privatisation in the
trees - James Buxton on the varied reactions to a review of the future of
forestry in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NOTHING BUT good can come of it.' That was the reaction of a senior figure
in the forestry industry to last week's news that the government has set up
an inter-departmental committee to review the future of forestry in Britain.
The committee, chaired by the Scottish Office but including civil servants
from other ministries including the Treasury, is looking both at the future
ownership of the Forestry Commission's woodlands, and at the effectiveness
of government incentives for tree planting.
Many in British forestry think the government now has a chance to give the
industry a new structure, by both privatising the Forestry Commission's
900,000 hectares of woodland and improving the incentives for tree planting.
But the Labour party and conservation groups fear privatisation would mean
less access to woods for the public, and would weaken the drive for
'sensitive forestry'.
In British forestry 1988 was a watershed year. In the budget Mr Nigel
Lawson, the chancellor, announced the abolition of tax incentives for tree
planting and their replacement with greatly enhanced grants. People in
forestry now admit that the old system had brought forestry into disrepute,
with the planting of trees on the environmentally sensitive Flow country of
Caithness in Scotland as a tax shelter for the wealthy being a final excess.
But since then the rate of tree planting has fallen from its all-time peak
of 29,000 ha in the year to March 1988 to 17,300 ha in 1992 (the
government's target of 33,000 ha a year has never been attained).
As before, most trees are planted by private landowners, with the Forestry
Commission planting only 3,000 ha in 1992. A greater proportion of newly
planted trees, especially in England, are broad-leaved rather than conifers,
The forestry and timber industries would like to see more trees planted. Mr
Peter Johnson, chairman of Tilhill Economic Forestry, a Booker subsidiary,
says: 'Forestry is a wonderful industry. Trees grow twice as fast here than
in most of the countries we import from. Our processing industry is state of
the art. But we are being held back.'
He would like to see changes in the tax regulations to encourage individual
savers to invest in forestry, by granting forestry unit trusts the same tax
treatment as forestry owners enjoy. 'Productive timber is currently owned by
fewer than 5,000 individuals in Britain. Yet 200,000 people make voluntary
contributions for tree planting to the Woodland Trust. We need to create a
vehicle through which they can make a return.'
Mr Robert Rickman, a forestry specialist who is a director of Forestry
Investment Management, a consultancy, says forestry now has a chance to
'shake off the stigmas of the past. It could be a successful industry but we
cannot benefit from it because we don't have the right structure.'
He is a strong advocate of privatising the Forestry Commission's woods. The
commission split itself into two in 1992, with the Forestry Authority
regulating planting and handing out grants, and the Forestry Enterprise
running the commission's forests.
Privatisation, he and others believe, would generate efficiencies and free
the Forestry Enterprise from stultifying Treasury constraints. He now thinks
privatisation would best be achieved by breaking up the estate and selling
it in large geographically defined chunks, which would mostly be acquired by
financial institutions, landowners and timber users.
Mr Rickman believes the Forestry Enterprise might be worth Pounds 1.5bn on
the basis of the real rate of return which he thinks it capable.
Woods with high amenity value would be separated out and handed over to
conservation bodies or local authorities.
Although the Ramblers Association last week was quick to voice its
disapproval of privatisation, on the grounds that it threatened people's
'freedom to roam', Mr Rickman says: 'Public access on foot causes forestry
owners no problems at all. The only problems might occur where the local
gentry go shooting.'
The Forestry Commission, based in Edinburgh and digesting its latest change
of structure, is watching events with foreboding, but is unable to comment.
It is aware that stripped of its woods, it would be a slender organisation.
Mr Robin Cutler, its chief executive, was formally head of forestry in New
Zealand where commercial woods were privatised. He is said to have found it
an unhappy experience.

FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Race under way to raise rice
harvest by 60% - Victor Mallet looks at an organisation dedicated to
increasing global production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE uninitiated, it sounds like an impossible task: in the next three
decades the annual global rice harvest must rise by 60 per cent to about
760m tonnes to feed the world's fast-growing population.
This surge in production, furthermore, will probably have to be achieved
without increasing the land area presently under rice. There is little room
for expansion in Asia - where most of the world's inhabitants and most
rice-eaters live - and in some countries urban sprawl has actually reduced
rice acreages. Since 1980, the total area cultivated for rice has remained
steady at about 146m hectares.
Yet the scientists at the Dollars 30m-a-year International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI) in Los Banos, south of the Philippine capital Manila, are
confident that they can lead a successful campaign to increase rice yields
by the amount required to stave off global starvation for another 30 years.
They have done it once; six years after the IRRI was founded in 1960, they
contributed to the 'green revolution' by releasing a 'miracle' rice variety
called IR8 which doubled and tripled yields and helped to avert famines
predicted for the 1970s - and they think they can do it again.
Mr Gurdev Khush, an IRRI veteran with 25 years service at the institute, who
heads the plant breeding, genetics and biochemistry division, says the first
step is to make further improvements to the 'architecture' of the rice
plant.
By cross-breeding stiff-strawed, dwarf varieties with larger plants that
respond well to fertiliser but tend to collapse under the weight of their
own grain, scientists have already succeeded in reducing the proportion of
straw to grain in the plant to 50:50 from 70:30, and he believes that they
will be able to increase the grain's share of the plant's weight to 60 per
cent.
The IRRI also plans to help increase the total rice harvest by shifting some
of its attention from high-yielding, irrigated rice where most advances have
been made to date and concentrating on raising yields in rain-fed areas and
marginal zones affected by such constraints as salinity and deep water.
According to IRRI officials, it should be possible to raise yields for deep
water rice to about 3.5 tonnes per hectare from about one tonne now, and to
double yields for upland rice to 2.5 tonnes. By comparison, typical maximum
yields for irrigated rice are about seven tonnes in the wet season and 10
tonnes in the dry season. IRRI wants to raise the maximum to 15 tonnes by
2010.
The institute has made great strides in breeding rice varieties that are
resistant to salinity, insect pests and other adverse conditions. But the
organisation is finding it harder to further increase maximum yields because
genetic and other factors that determine yield are highly complex.
One way of raising yields is to use first-generation hybrids (Mr Khush says
this can increase yield by another 25 per cent) rather than varieties
selectively bred by the IRRI through six or seven generations. The hybrid
method has been successfully adopted by China, but the problem is that
farmers have to buy new seeds each time they plant the crop, because
subsequent generations lose the yield advantage.
Genetic engineering may provide a solution. Mr Khush is hoping that it will
be possible to put an 'apomixis' gene (such as the one found in millet) into
rice, which would allow the hybrids to reproduce asexually and therefore
maintain their high yield. 'It's a frontier project,' he says. 'We don't
have any apomixis genes in rice as yet.'
Rice might benefit in other ways from the young science of genetic
engineering. Mr John Bennett, IRRI's senior molecular biologist, is
interested in introducing genes from barley which instruct the plant to
produce fungus-resistant proteins.
'The reason for the emphasis at the moment on this sort of approach -
resistance to biotic stresses - is that we know how to do it,' says Mr
Bennett. 'The problem with yield is that we have only a very rudimentary
understanding of what controls yield.'
The institute does not confine itself to technology. Mr Mahabub Hossain, the
agricultural economist who heads IRRI's social sciences division, warned
recently that falling unit prices for rice paid to Asian farmers and higher
labour costs could threaten the growth of rice production.
'It is time to ask whether Asian countries will be able to meet the future
demand for rice of their still rapidly growing populations, given present
prices and current technology,' he said. 'The easy gains from modern rice
technology have already been achieved, particularly in irrigated rice.'
China, the world's largest rice producer and consumer, has already adopted
modern technology, irrigated much of its rice and is producing high yields.
'They have done a fantastic job,' says Mr Keith Ingram, an IRRI agronomist.
'There is not much room for improvement.'
IRRI scientists nevertheless believe they can increase yields sufficiently
to meet projected Asian demand in the year 2020, although they admit there
will be environmental costs and other pitfalls as farmers move into marginal
areas.
They have noticed that paddy fields subjected to three crops a year with no
time to lie fallow have started to produce less for a given amount of
fertiliser, possibly because of mineral deficiencies. 'We don't understand
this phenomenon,' says Mr Khush. 'We are mining these soils.'
Only about 3 per cent of world rice production is currently traded
internationally, but the idea of growing rice in the (relatively) uncrowded
countries of Latin America or Africa and shipping it in vast quantities to
Asia is already being mooted.
IRRI scientists think they can hold the line for another three decades by
helping to increase yields. But they say that the next stage after 2020, if
the world population keeps growing rapidly, will be much more difficult.

FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ in Burundi nickel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, THE world's biggest mining company, might join the world's select few
nickel miners via a long-term agreement signed in London yesterday with the
Central African Republic of Burundi.
The agreement gives RTZ exploration and potential development rights to half
of Burundi's prospective nickel belt which is 300km long and 40km wide in
places.
This is the first agreement signed by the government of Burundi with a big
mining company. However, Burundi is also having talks with Broken Hill
Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, about a potential
exploration deal covering the other half of the nickel belt.
At present RTZ's only nickel interest is the Empress refinery in Zimbabwe
which toll refines about 6,000 tonnes a year of the metal for BCL, Botswana.
An RTZ official pointed out that its exploration policy excluded no
commodity but the group was interested only in world-class deposits. The
deal with Burundi followed an RTZ review of the mining potential in African
countries, carried out since 1990.
Most of the potential resources are nickel but Burundi also has deposits of
gold, phosphate and industrial minerals such as kaolin and cement raw
materials.

FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Change in Russian diamond trade
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA would make more from the diamond trade if it abandoned its right to
sell 5 per cent of its production and put everything through De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation (CSO), according to a senior Russian diamond
industry executive.
Mr Sergei Ulin, a director of Almazy-Rossii Sakha (ARS), the state-dominated
company which produces and markets Russian diamonds, believes 'it's quite
evident that changes are required'. In the past he has defended Russia's
1990 agreement with De Beers under which 95 per cent of rough diamond
exports must go through the CSO.
'The world is very different from when we signed the agreement, and we are
different too,' Mr Ulin said. He now believes that the separate sale of 5
per cent - agreed so that Russia had a means of checking the price it was
paid by De Beers - is undermining the CSO's 'one-channel' system which aims
to keep prices as high as possible.
Some parliamentarians and the State Committee for Precious Stones and Metals
have on the contrary complained that 5 per cent is too little and that the
sales are only allowed in Moscow.
'I don't believe that 5, 10, or 15 per cent, whether it is sold in Moscow or
anywhere else, will give us the information which we would like to have,' Mr
Ulin said. It would be better for Russian representatives to attend De
Beers' diamond sales or 'sights' in London as did some other producers to
ensure fair play.
He also clarified ARS's plans to overhaul, along market lines, the system
whereby rough stones are sold to Russian-based diamond cutters. This will
consist of holding sights for cutters, forcing them to buy a full range of
stones, including difficult ones they are not used to cutting.

GOLD traded most of the day in a very narrow range on the London bullion
market, apparently expecting a lead from Comex. But New York opened weaker
before some commission house buying held it at the Dollars 340 a troy ounce
support point in early trading. One trader noted that the market was
particularly nervous after several weeks of inactivity - 'as soon as there
is a move, everybody tries to cover.' London gold, silver and platinum
prices ended slighlty lower. OIL markets were also nervous after Kuwait said
it would produce more than its quota if other Opec countries continued to do
so. The postponement of weekly API stocks data until today helped to rob the
market of direction. On the LME copper's fall put NICKEL, ZINC and ALUMINIUM
under pressure. Three-month aluminium fell to a 16-month lows of Dollars
1,126 a tonne, the 18,100-tonne rise in LME stocks underlining fundamental
oversupply. Zinc's decline was cushioned by the recent production cuts in
Mexico and Canada. London robusta COFFEE turned morning losses into gains as
New York seemed content to head higher despite no fresh news.

FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper at lowest point since
1988
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER, THE one London Metal Exchange-traded metal to have remained buoyant
despite recession in most of the world's industrialised countries, came
under severe selling pressure yesterday and the price in US dollar terms
dropped to its lowest point since June, 1988.
The price of copper for delivery in three months dropped by Dollars 52 a
tonne to close in London at Dollars 2,090, some Dollars 300 below the
Dollars 2,400 peak it reached earlier this year.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural
resources group, said there was a substantial volume of selling from the Far
East and by China yesterday which forced the copper price down through the
psychologically-important Dollars 2,100 a tonne level.
'However, with the US economic recovery still looking strong, it is
difficult to get too bearish,' he added. Mr Adams pointed out that LME
option declarations are due today so 'the markets are expected to be
volatile.'
Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research, said copper 'has been
defying economic gravity since the recession started and has the greatest
potential of all the metals to fall.'
He pointed out that every time the price seemed likely to fall some
interruption to supply or Chinese buying came to the rescue.
'Will it be rescued again? It appears unlikely. Stocks are rising, there are
no supply problems. We could see quite a sharp fall in price.'
However, Mr Buxton said that as long as the price did not fall below 90
cents a lb, compared with 95 cents last night, the copper industry would go
on making profits.
Copper is still quoted in sterling on the LME and three-month metal fell by
another Pounds 14.75 a tonne yesterday to close at Pounds 1,400.75. In first
two days this week the price has fallen by Pounds 35.25 a tonne, or by
nearly 2.5 per cent.

FT  07 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Hopes of repo rate cut boost German
government paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets rose strongly yesterday, spurred by weak economic data
in Germany and hopes of a cut in the key German money market rate today.
Ten-year German government bonds jumped by half a point as a rumour swept
the market that the Bundesbank had indicated to several institutions that it
would accept bids as low as 8.05 per cent in today's 14-day repo tender.
This compares with the 8.17 per cent at the last repo.
Several traders and analysts reported that institutions they had talked to
and which were bidding in today's tender denied they had been approached,
helping to dampen hopes of a large cut. But weak economic data left most
analysts expecting a cut in the repo to 8.12 per cent or even 8.10 per cent
today.
Seasonably-adjusted unemployment rose by 56,000, while manufacturing orders
showed an annual decline of 13.6 per cent. On top of weak industrial
production figures last week, it was enough to reinforce market confidence.
Also, the Bundesbank was expected to engineer a further cut in money market
rates to leave room for the long-awaited cut in the French five to 10-day
rate, which is expected tomorrow.
While cash bunds rose half a point, the June bund futures contract on Liffe
rose from 85.34 to close at around 95.82, close to its high of the day.
THE yield on 10-year French bonds fell by around seven basis points, in line
with their German counterparts, as the market continued to be buoyed by a
strong franc and the prospect of an interest rate cut.
At 56 basis points, the yield spread between bunds and OATs hovered at its
lowest for many months, and sharply lower than before the French elections,
when it stood some 25 to 30 basis points higher.
But analysts warned that 10-year bond yields were unlikely to advance much
further relative to Germany in the short-term.
The franc remained firm yesterday, at FFr3.385 to the D-Mark, while call
money stood at around 10.5 per cent, giving a firm background against which
an interest rate cut could be announced.
LONGER-dated UK government bonds regained some ground lost during the
sell-off on Monday, prompted partly by a move by traders to close bear
positions. Short-dated and index-linked gilts remained unmoved, leading to a
slight flattening of the yield curve.
The long gilt future on Liffe opened at 105 15/16 and rose early in the day,
ending near its high at around 106 11/32 .
WHILE other European markets were firm, Spanish government bonds dropped
sharply on political uncertainty. The yield on 10-year bonds jumped by more
than 20 basis points as the peseta fell on signs of deepening divisions in
the ruling Socialist party.
THE yield curve flattened yesterday in the US Treasury bond market as the
short end was weighed down by a flood of new paper, and the long end bounced
back from the sell-off of late last week. In late New York trading, the
benchmark 30-year Treasury issue stood at 101 31/32 , up 3/4 , to yield
6.969 per cent, while the two-year note traded around 99 29/32 , up  1/16 to
yield 3.908.
The spread between the two narrowed to 306 basis points from 311 late on
Monday in light trading. Analysts said the next economic hurdle would be the
producer price index, due on Thursday.
While the long end rally was helped by lower commodity prices, the short end
had to cope with a flood of supply, following Congress's passage on Monday
of an increase in the debt ceiling to Dollars 4,370bn from Dollars 4,145bn.
The Treasury yesterday sold Dollars 14.25bn in 52-week bills, while the
market had to cope with Dollars 17bn of 15-day cash management bills. The
Treasury also announced the sale today of Dollars 22.4bn in 13 and 26-week
bills, originally scheduled for April 5.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling and French franc deals
dominate lively session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALS in French francs and sterling dominated a lively session in the
Eurobond market yesterday.
SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, launched a Pounds 100m
five-year issue via Samuel Montagu, while Woolwich Building Society issued a
Pounds 150m three-year deal via Union Bank of Switzerland. Both deals were
considered rather aggressively priced, but demand for sterling bonds from
overseas and UK investors remains quite firm, and the deals are expected to
be placed over the next week or so.
In particular, the SmithKline Beecham deal was offered at the same yield as
an outstanding Pounds 100m issue, with which it is fungible. Further, the
yield spread of 62 basis points over the comparable gilt takes advantage of
the shape of the yield curve: as with many recent issues, the bond matures
at the end of 1998, while the gilt matures in March 1998, which makes the
deal appear more generous.
Dealers said the fact that the issue was offered at a premium of several
points above par also detered some investors. However, the previous issue,
launched at the end of January at a spread of 75 basis points, performed
well, meeting demand even above par. The deal was swapped into floating-rate
sterling.
Woolwich's three-year deal was also considered rather tightly priced at 45
basis points over the curve. However, there has been very little paper at
the short end of the yield curve, and existing paper is trading at tight
levels.
But dealers said that mainstream investors were not very interested in the
short end of the market. However, there was demand from asset swappers, who
were able to swap the bonds into floating-rate assets paying about 30 basis
points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
In the French franc market, two large deals by Societe Nationale des Chemins
de Fer francais (SNCF), the French national railway, dominated the day's
trading. SNCF launched a FFr4bn issue due 2008, consisting of a FFr2bn
international tranche, and a FFr1.5bn domestic offering due 2005.
Dealers said that the FFr4bn 15-year deal via Credit Commercial de France
met strong demand, particularly from international investors, who are
expected to account for more than half the paper placed. SNCF did not swap
the proceeds, taking the opportunity to lock in historically low 15-year
rates.
Also in the French market, Alcatel launched a FFr2bn five-year deal via
Societe Generale, priced to yield 55 basis points over the curve.
Elsewhere, the Republic of Finland, which has been rumoured in French francs
in recent weeks, launched a SFr200m five-year issue via UBS.

THE outlook for Venezuela's long-term debt was amended to negative yesterday
by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, only days after the country's
successful return to the D-Mark sector of the international bond market.
S&amp;P, while it affirmed Venezuela's double-B credit rating, said its
adjustment to the country's outlook was prompted by 'the increasing
political difficulties' the government faced in pushing through electoral
and economic reforms.
Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, has lowered the credit ratings of
two Japanese trust banks due to asset quality problems and a poor outlook on
long-term profitability, Emiko Terazono writes in Tokyo.
Long-term ratings at Sumitomo Trust and Banking and Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking were lowered to Baa1 from A2.

INTERNATIONAL equity investors can expect a spate of issues from the
telecommunications sector over the next few months, with international share
deals scheduled to come from Chile, Greece, the UK and Singapore.
Investment bankers expect Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean
telecommunications group, to have its 10-year convertible bond issue sized
and priced today.
Goldman Sachs is lead-manager for the deal, expected to raise up to Dollars
182.6m in total. The exact size of the international portion, however, will
be determined by how much of the domestic rights offering is taken up. The
results of the domestic rights offering were due late last night.
The conversion premium is expected to be between 22 and 25 per cent and the
yield to redemption between 5.5 and 6 per cent. Bankers expect half the deal
to be sold in the US and the rest internationally. So far, those involved in
the deal have noted strong demand for the issue, pointing out this is the
first convertible bond issue to emerge from Chile.
Further news emerged yesterday concerning the privatisation of OTE, the
Greek state telecom group. The Greek government has appointed Credit Suisse
First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg as joint global co-ordinators and
joint international lead-managers for the sale of 14 per cent of the state
telecoms monopoly.
The offering, due to be launched in the autumn, is expected to raise up to
Dollars 420m, of which about Dollars 150m will be offered to international
investors mainly in the UK and Europe. Four per cent of the company will be
offered to employees on preferential terms, while the remaining 10 per cent
will be split roughly equally into a domestic and an international tranche,
according to a government adviser.
The equity offering is the largest so far in Greece. It will be launched
after the first stage of OTE's partial privatisation - the sale of a 35 per
cent stake to an international telecom operator - is completed. The
government will keep control of 51 per cent of the telecoms group.
Morgan Stanley, Paribas Capital Markets and N. M. Rothschild are co-managers
for the international tranche. Several Greek financial institutions will be
selected in coming weeks to manage the domestic tranche.
OTE, the only profitable Greek utility, forecasts earnings of around Dr190bn
this year. But it faces heavy pension liabilities and needs substantial
investment to modernise its network.

a US producer of digital signal processing (DSP) chips which are used in
high-definition television and multimedia products.
Samsung Electronics said that it wanted to develop DSP chip technology with
Array. It has co-operated with Array since December 1990 in developing and
marketing image compression chips for HDTV. Samsung is developing an HDTV
system with its sister subsidiary, Samsung Electron Devices.
The Array shareholding is the latest in a recent series of ventures that
Samsung has concluded with foreign semiconductor makers, including a
licensing agreement with Toshiba for flash memory chips.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Poland's banking privatisation
given Dollars 12.7m injection

<TEXT>
POLAND'S long-delayed bank privatisation programme got under way yesterday
following a decision by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) to invest 210bn zlotys (Dollars 12.7m) in Poland's Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy (WBK) ahead of a public share offer due to open next week.
The government hoped to attract a foreign commercial bank to buy into the
WBK, the first of nine state-owned commercial banks carved from the National
Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank, four years ago.
However, the Polish finance ministry, advised by Shroders, the UK merchant
bank, was unable to find a foreign bank willing to take a minority stake at
this stage.
The EBRD has spent six months running a due diligence examination of the
bank's loan portfolio. It agreed to acquire 28.5 per cent of the WBK's
equity, while private foreign and domestic investors are being offered 1.74m
shares, or 27.2 per cent, through the public share offer.
Last year, WBK reported a net profit of 237.4bn zlotys on a balance sheet of
14,659.7bn zlotys. That followed a 1991 loss of 706.6bn zlotys, due largely
to provisions for bad debts on a balance sheet worth 11,367bn zlotys.
The WBK remains relatively unencumbered by bad loans and has swapped debt
owed by the Warsaw steelworks for equity in the company's Dollars 200m joint
venture with Lucchini, the private Italian steelmaker.
More than one-third of the bank's loan portfolio, some 2,589bn zlotys, has
been classified as 'doubtful and overdue', with provisions set at 1,100bn
zlotys. More than 40 per cent of the bank's loan portfolio is with
private-sector companies.
The share price for the public offer has been set at 115,000 zlotys, giving
the WBK a price equity ratio of 2.7, roughly comparable to the 16 stocks now
being traded on Warsaw's fledgling stock exchange.
The state treasury will retain a 30 per cent stake. The bank's 3,500
employees are to be offered 14 per cent at half the price of the shares on
offer to the general public.
At least two foreign banks are considering a stake, Mr Guy de Selliers, the
EBRD's deputy head of merchant banking, said in London.
The EBRD has already committed Ecu550m (Dollars 649m) to Poland, and the
stake in the WBK is not only its largest investment in a financial
institution in Poland but also the forerunner of similar investments
elsewhere in central Europe. Half the estimated Pounds 1.6m (Dollars 2.27m)
cost of the WBK sale is being borne by the British government's Know How
Fund.
The Polish government is continuing to look for foreign commercial banks
willing to take important stakes in the nine commercial banks up for
privatisation, Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, confirmed
yesterday.
Next on the list is the forthcoming disposal of the Bank Slaski, which is
being handled by Paribas.
The WBK has 41 branches and 252,000 clients with deposits of 9,600bn zlotys.
It is receiving management advice from the Allied Irish Bank under a
three-year 'twinning' contract.
The EBRD's present investment in the WBK will bring the bank's capital
adequacy ratio up to 12 per cent, the general target for the government's
World Bank supported domestic bank debt restructuring programme.

PEREGRINE Investments, the holding company for the Hong Kong merchant bank
Peregrine Capital, yesterday posted net profits 101 per cent ahead at
HKDollars 607.8m (Dollars 78.6m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 302.9m the year
before, helped by strong brokerage and corporate finance activities, AP-DJ
reports from Hong Kong.
Earnings per share advanced 21 per cent to 23.6 cents from 19.5 cents, and
the directors declared a final dividend of 6 cents a share, pushing the
year's payout to 10.5 cents, up 27 per cent from 8.3 cents for 1991.
They also recommended a one-for-five bonus issue followed by a share
consolidation of six into one new share.
The group's turnover jumped 125 per cent to HKDollars 4.24bn from HK1.89bn.
Mr Philip Tose, chairman, said the group's merchant banking activities
retained their leading position in the colony in underwriting local rights
issues and initial public offerings, as well as mergers and acquisitions.
Peregrine Capital was 'a pioneer and market leader' in sponsoring Chinese
enterprises seeking to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, he said.
In 1992, it participated in more than 40 fund-raising exercises, involving
total funds of more than HKDollars 19bn.
Mr Tose said the bank had built a big presence in China. The People's Bank
of China, the country's central bank, had allowed it to open an office.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Tense house of Tata stands
divided against itself - Stefan Wagstyl looks at the bitter war of
succession engaging two generations of managers in Bombay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSE of Tata, India's largest business group, likes to exude an air of
quiet authority.
Its Bombay headquarters, a drab brown building with brass plaques by the
door, resembles an old-fashioned merchant bank. A bust of the the group's
19th century founder commands the entrance hall. From the day executives
start, they are taught that Tata's greatest asset is the Tata name.
But Tata's self-assurance has been disturbed by a bitter boardroom battle at
Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), its flagship company. The fight centres on the
last-ditch effort by Mr Russi Mody, Tisco's flamboyant 75-year-old chairman,
to delay his enforced retirement.
Ranged against him are Mr JRD Tata, the group's 88-year-old patriarch, and
Mr Ratan Tata, 55-year-old cousin and chosen heir. Last month, Mr Mody
stormed out of a Tisco board meeting when the issue of his retirement was
raised. The board decided that Mr Mody should leave this year, but the exact
date will involve delicate negotiations.
The battle highlights the difficulties India's family-based businesses face
in satisfying the conflicting ambitions of family members, professional
managers, and shareholders.
Tata Sons, the group's privately-owned nerve centre, mostly holds only small
stakes in its large publicly-listed operating companies, which have a
combined annual turnover of Dollars 4.5bn in everything from lorries to
lipstick, as well as steel, cement and chemicals.
Mr Ratan Tata, a thoughtful man who took over as chairman of Tata Sons from
Mr JRD Tata in 1991, says his aim is to bring greater focus and cohesion to
the group. To succeed, he must stamp his authority upon the group's ageing
chiefs - including Mr Mody - and promote a new generation of managers.
Mr Ratan Tata's task might have been easier if he had started sooner. His
advance to the chairmanship of Tata Sons was delayed by Mr JRD Tata's
determination to stay at the helm. Even now, the elder Tata remains on the
Tata Sons board, creating the impression that Mr Ratan Tata is not yet his
own master.
Mr JRD Tata's reluctance to retire is understandable. He had run Tata since
taking over at the early age of 34 in 1938; he founded Air India -
subsequently nationalised - and piloted its first flight.
His easy-going manner endeared him to managers and workers alike. At
Jamshedpur, Tisco's home and a company town of 700,000 inhabitants, the
annual founder's day ceremonies turned into acts of homage to the greatest
living Tata.
Mr Mody was Mr JRD Tata's ablest protege. He was outside the family, but
like the Tatas he is a Parsee, a member of a wealthy and close-knit
religious community which survives in Bombay centuries after its ancestors
fled persecution in Persia.
While Mr Tata directed the group from Bombay, Mr Mody ran the steelworks at
Jamshedpur, presiding over decades of strike-free production. He is also a
pilot, an accomplished chef and a pianist. As a student at Oxford, he once
accompanied the violin-playing Albert Einstein.
A man of modest height and great ambition, he compared himself with Napoleon
and once declared that Harrow School, his alma mater, had produced only
three great men in the 20th century: Winston Churchill, Jawarhalal Nehru,
and Russi Mody.
When Mr JRD Tata finally indicated in his early 80s, that he was preparing
to retire, Mr Mody saw himself as the natural successor. Family ties and the
advantage of youth favoured Mr Ratan Tata.
Mr Ratan Tata, who had studied engineering and architecture in the US before
working his way up the group, inherited a tricky position. Tata's cohesion
was based less on intra-group shareholdings - as low as 8 per cent in Tisco
 -than on Mr JRD Tata's personal authority.
The crunch came when the Tata Sons board last year passed a resolution
requiring all group managing directors to retire at 65 and chairmen at 75.
Mr Mody claimed that the resolution was aimed personally at him.
In scenes unprecedented in Indian business, both sides last May appealed to
the prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. Mr Rao stayed out of the fight. Mr
Mody admitted defeat, but managed to secure a compromise - the right to
remain as non-executive chairman with some executive powers, including
control of exports, with Mr Aditya Kashyap, his close friend and protege, to
assist him.
The public feuding ended last summer, but tensions remained high in Tisco
with Mr Mody and Mr Irani barely on speaking terms. The atmosphere was
poisoned by, among other things, a dispute about whether Tata should bid to
take over a state-owned steel plant which the government wanted to
privatise. Mr Mody was in favour. Mr Irani refused on the grounds that Tisco
was in the middle of a large-scale factory modernisation programme.
The two men also quarrelled over a Dollars 1.5m private jet which appeared
in Tata's hangars in Jamshedpur airport in 1990. According to Mr Mody, the
Citation aircraft was sent to India by Korf, a large German engineering
concern and a joint-venture partner of Tisco. It was intended to be used by
Korf personnel and remains Korf's property, says Mr Mody.
The plane has been flown almost exclusively by Mr Mody, its running costs
have been paid by Tata companies, and it is regarded by Tata employees in
Jamshedpur as the chairman's personal toy.
The argument is not trivial since Indian foreign exchange law forbids
Indians from buying imported private jets.
Mr Mody says he has no regrets about the way he has been treated by the Tata
family. 'They treated me like a prince,' he says. But he believes that after
his years of service he should not be harried out of the group.
Mr Ratan Tata says the retirement rules must apply to everybody. Everybody,
that is, except Mr JRD Tata. 'JRD is unique,' he says. And, Mr Mody might
add, he is also a Tata.

KNP BT, the big Dutch paper and packaging group created out of a three-way
merger last month, saw net profits plummet by nearly 75 per cent in 1992,
underlying the difficult market conditions.
Combined pro forma net profit for the three merger partners - the Dutch
companies KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - fell to Fl 116m (Dollars 64.6m)
from Fl 443m in 1991. If extraordinary items are excluded, net profit
declined by 64 per cent to Fl 175m from Fl 489m a year earlier.
Overall, group operating profit was down 42 per cent at Fl 538m. Sales
increased by 2.2 per cent to Fl 11.76bn.

MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, has cut the 1992 bonuses paid
to its leading executives by between 30 per cent and 45 per cent, despite
making record profits, according to its annual proxy statement to
shareholders.
A company spokeswoman said that its performance relative to the rest of the
securities industry had not been as strong as previously, and this was one
of several factors which went into the compensation equation.
Securities firms with retail operations had tended to perform better in 1992
than those with an institutional client bias, she added.
Mr Richard Fisher and Mr Robert Greenhill, respectively chairman and
president of the group, each received compensation of Dollars 6.25m, down 20
per cent from Dollars 7.81m in 1991. Their bonuses were cut 41 per cent to
Dollars 2.86m.
At Merrill Lynch, the largest US brokerage firm, Mr William Schreyer,
chairman, saw his cash compensation rise 16 per cent to Dollars 5.2m, while
Mr Donald Marron of PaineWebber received Dollars 7.7m, up more than 50 per
cent.
Morgan Stanley also announced yesterday that Mr Dick Cheney, defence
secretary under President George Bush, was joining its board.
PepsiCo Foods International, which bought a controlling share in Poland's
Wedel confectionery plant two years ago, is to lift its initial five-year
investment commitment by 25 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Last year, Wedel saw sales increase by 52 per cent to 1,583bn zlotys
(Dollars 95.8m) and reported net profit 48 per cent up at 240.7bn zlotys,
due partly to a tax holiday.

ROYAL Oak Mines, the aggressive Canadian gold producer, has bought control
of Geddes Resources, a small exploration company which is engaged in a
high-profile battle with environmentalists over plans to build a large
copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia.
Royal Oak will pay CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.9m) for the 39 per cent stake
in Geddes currently held by Northgate Exploration.
Royal Oak said the acquisition 'has significant upside potential and limited
downside risk'. The deposit is estimated to contain 300m tonnes of copper
ore with a grade of 1.38 per cent, as well as substantial quantities of
gold, silver and cobalt.
The British Columbia provincial government has come under strong pressure
from environmental groups in the US and Canada to turn down Geddes'
application.
The environmentalists contend that the mine will do incalculable damage to
the Tatshenshini River and the surrounding region, which is widely regarded
as one of most scenic wilderness areas on the continent.
Should the project not go ahead, Royal Oak is banking on suitable
compensation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday
reported higher-than-expected first-quarter results, although an increase in
tax rates caused a dip in earnings.
Revenues for the first quarter were Dollars 407.4m. Net income was Dollars
61.5m before payment of preferred stock dividends.
After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income amounted to Dollars
58.9m, or 63 cents a share. In the same quarter a year ago AMD reported
higher earnings of Dollars 84.9m before the dividend, and Dollars 82.3m, or
90 cents, after the dividend, on the same level of revenues.
AMD said its tax rate in the quarter was 28 per cent, against 15 per cent in
the first quarter of 1992 when it was able to carry forward losses and use
tax credits to lower its overall tax rate.
It said sales of its 386 microprocessor, used in personal computers, reached
record volumes, although prices were 'dramatically lower' than a year ago.
Reduced microprocessor revenues were more than offset by increased sales of
other products, including non-volatile memory chips.
Sales in North America and Europe reached record levels in the quarter,
while in Japan they declined, reflecting continued weakness in the Japanese
semiconductor market.
'The current market recovery in information technology, with strong demand
for computation and communications equipment, plays directly into AMD's
strengths,' said Mr W. J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive.
AMD also announced it had signed a definitive agreement with Fujitsu of
Japan to build a Dollars 700m semiconductor plant in Wakamatsu, Japan.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: GM names new head of worldwide
purchasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors has unexpectedly named Mr Richard Wagoner, its young chief
financial officer, to replace Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as
head of worldwide purchasing last month and controversially joined
Volkswagen in Germany.
Mr Wagoner, 40, who was only named chief financial officer last November,
will continue to hold that position as well as taking on Mr Lopez's
responsibilities.
The move surprised some analysts, who questioned whether Mr Wagoner would be
able to devote sufficient time to the purchasing job while wearing two hats,
and noted that he had spent much of his career on the financial side of GM,
rather than in manufacturing.
Reform of the purchasing system - including pressuring suppliers to cut
prices - forms a crucial part of GM's drive to turn its loss-making North
American car operations back to profit.
Mr Lopez is believed to have saved GM more than Dollars 1bn in costs during
his 10 months in the job. An important element of his success was his
obsessive, idiosyncratic and energetic nature.
Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said yesterday daily staff operations of
the finance group would be overseen by Mr Leon Krain, a corporate
vice-president, allowing Mr Wagoner to focus immediately on his purchasing
responsibilities.
Mr Smith reiterated that the success of the purchasing initiative was vital
to GM's competitiveness and said Mr Wagoner brought to the task knowledge of
both operations and finance, as well as 'creativity, drive and leadership'.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Turner Broadcasting System, the cable television group founded by
Mr Ted Turner, rose sharply yesterday as Wall Street reacted to fresh
speculation that the company could be up for sale.
Turner's B shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to stand at Dollars 24 1/8 in early
trading in New York.
A press report yesterday suggested that Time-Warner, the world's largest
media group, and Tele-Communications, the largest cable operator in the US,
could be discussing plans to divide many of Turner Broadcasting's assets
between them. None of the three parties would comment.
Time and TCI each own about one-fifth of Turner Broadcasting's equity,
having rescued the company from debt difficulties in 1987.
Mr Turner, with around 37 per cent of the equity, retains 56 per cent of the
votes and thus control.
The fresh speculation follows rumours in February that Turner had been
discussing a possible merger with other media companies.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORNING, the US manufacturer of high technology and glass products,
yesterday reported a 9 per cent drop in comparable first-quarter net income,
which it blamed mainly on a weak results from businesses in which it has
equity interests.
The main culprits were Vitro Corning, its joint-venture houseware products
company with Mexico's Vitro, and Dow Corning, which last year was embroiled
in controversy over its breast implant products.
Corning said the weak results from these businesses were due to 'soft
economies in Mexico, Europe and Japan'.
Corning's net income totalled Dollars 47.2m, or 25 cents a share, excluding
accounting changes and special events, down 9 per cent when last year's
figures are adjusted on the same basis. Sales were up from Dollars 741m to
Dollars 817m.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said: 'Excluding special events, earnings from
consolidated operations increased 8 per cent. However, this gain was not
enough to offset the major decline in operations of equity companies.'
He added that while the group was not pleased with its overall performance,
it did not believe the results were indicative of the full year.
'The March operating results of consolidated companies were below our
expectations primarily as a result of a series of manufacturing,
distribution and service delivery disruptions caused by unusually severe
weather in the US,' he said.
He remained optimistic that the full-year performance would reflect the
com-pany's record of consistent growth.

The three companies warned of falling profits in November when they

Overall, group operating profit was down 42 per cent at Fl 538m. Sales
increased by 2.2 per cent to Fl 11.76bn.
KNP BT said yesterday there were few signs of improvement in its main

PEPSICO Foods International, which bought a controlling share in Poland's

five-year investment commitment by 25 per cent, Mr Peter Robinson, Wedel
chairman, told shareholders yesterday.
PFI originally paid Dollars 25m for the Wedel company and promised to invest
Dollars 56m by the end of 1996 to modernise and expand the confectionery
business. The programme, now to be increased to Dollars 70m, includes
construction of a new salty snacks plant outside Warsaw.
Last year, Wedel saw sales increase by 52 per cent to 1,583bn zlotys
(Dollars 95.8m) and reported net profit 48 per cent up at 240.7bn zlotys,
due partly to a tax holiday.
The shareholders approved an 8,000 zlotys-a-share dividend.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERIDANIA Beghin-Say, the Paris-based sugar, agro-industrial and branded
foods company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi-Montedison group, raised net
profits by 70 per cent to FFr1.28bn (Dollars 232m) last year from FFr754m in
1991.
The improvement stems from recent acquisitions and more favourable markets,
notably on the oil seeds side. Group sales rose by 22 per cent to FFr49.7bn,
while net operating profits were up 35 per cent to FFr3.62bn. The dividend
remains unchanged at FFr30 for each share or investment certificate.
EBS warned that the 1992 figures were not directly comparable with those for
1991 owing to the effect of the merger with Eridania, Ferruzzi-Montedison's
Italian sugar operation, acquisitions and changes in accounting practices.
The 1992 figures represent the first results produced after Ferruzzi's
complex restructuring of its French and Italian sugar and foods interests
last year. As a result, Eridania, which held 60 per cent of Beghin-Say's
capital, conferred its Italian sugar business and a 30 per cent stake in a
starch group co-owned with the French company to Beghin-Say, creating the
bigger EBS.
In spite of last year's rise, Beghin-Say's profits have only recovered to
the levels of 1990, when net earnings amounted to FFr1.08bn. The subsequent
fall stemmed from lower exceptional items and rising debts from
acquisitions, including Lesieur and Ducros.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM in FFr2.5bn bid for
computing services group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, is launching a bid for
Compagnie General d'Informatique, the French computing services company.
The bid values the computing services company at just over FFr2.5bn (Dollars
461m), about 1.2 times turnover and 17.5 times CGI's net profit in 1992.
It represents a further development in the trend for computer hardware
manufacturers to move into computing services, where there is still vigorous
growth and gross profit margins are larger.
The area where CGI is strongest - integrated applications packages,
customised software programs and consultancy - is also the area that would
be most profitable for computing services companies over the next five
years.
CGI supplies applications software and computing services and is active
throughout Europe and North America, where it has had a presence since 1982.
It employs about 4,200 staff worldwide and was originally noted for creating
software tools - software that makes it easier to write other software. It
has a range of financial and manufacturing software and offers training in
software development methods.
Mr Claude Andreuzza, president of the board of IBM France, said yesterday
that the company would offer one IBM France convertible bond with a nominal
value of FFr355 for each CGI share. The bonds will have a 4 1/2 -year
maturity and a 5.7 per cent annual coupon.
Mr Robert Mallet, CGI chairman and managing director, Mr Bernard Chapot,
general manager, and Mr Jacques Debuisson, vice-president of the board of
directors, have already agreed to transfer their 25.3 per cent combined
shareholding to IBM France.
The bid is subject to authorisation by the French treasury and by the
American Office of Fair Trading and conditional on IBM receiving acceptances
from shareholders representing more than two-thirds of GCI voting rights.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Mercedes confronts Japan on
foreign soil - Martin Dickson in New York looks at Mercedes-Benz's plans to
open a plant in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST BMW, now Mercedes-Benz. Germany's two leading luxury car makers
suddenly both want to manufacture cars outside their domestic base and both
want to do so in the US. But the bold strategy has its risks.
Mercedes announced on Monday it intended to build a plant in the US, at a
cost of about Dollars 300m, which would make a new kind of four-wheel-drive
sports utility vehicle. A site would be chosen in the next three or four
months, and production of up to 60,000 vehicles a year would begin in 1997.
Two-thirds of production would go for export,with one-third for the US
market.
BMW announced last summer it would build a Dollars 350m plant in South
Carolina to manufacture up to 90,000 cars a year by 1995, about half of them
for export. The type of vehicle remains a secret.
Two inter-related factors have been pushing the Germans in this direction:
the need to confront head-on the rapid rise of Japanese luxury car marques
in the US, and the high cost of building cars in Germany. For Mercedes, an
additional factor is a change in corporate strategy under which it will make
vehicles outside its luxury niche.
Since the late 1980s, the Japanese have come from nowhere to capture nearly
31 per cent of the US luxury car market, with marques such as Lexus (owned
by Toyota) Infiniti (Nissan) and Acura (Honda).
They have captured sales from both European importers, who account for about
21 per cent of the market, and Detroit's Big Three, whose market share has
shrunk to about 48 per cent.
BMW has enjoyed a strong sales rebound over the past year, thanks to new
products, and Mercedes has seen rather more chequered growth, but the
combined annual US sales of the two companies, at about 130,000 units, is
far below the 196,000 peak reached in 1986.
Keen pricing has been crucial to the success of the Japanese marques and, in
spite of periodic accusations that the Japanese were dumping, German
manufacturers acknowledge their Asian rivals have a large cost production
advantage over them.
Manufacturing in the US, where parts and labour costs are lower than in
Germany, should narrow this differential.
Mr Helmut Werner, vice-chairman of Mercedes, says the company's US plant
should have production costs 30 per cent below those of its European
operations - though the group is in the throes of a cost drive aimed at
cutting European costs by precisely this amount anyway.
Manufacturing in America may help shelter the German companies from currency
fluctuations, since the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar has tended
to push up the price of European models when American consumers have been
looking for more value from their vehicles.
In addition, making cars in the US should give Mercedes and BMW valuable
experience in battling the Japanese in the world's biggest and most open car
market, before the Japanese launch their inevitable thrust into the European
luxury market.
'To be successful in the world, a company has to be successful in the US,'
said Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, when he broke ground for the
company's plant in South Carolina last September.
BMW raided Honda, the Japanese company with the longest manufacturing
presence in the US, for two of the top jobs at its South Carolina plant. One
of the duo, Mr Al Kinzer, was recently quoted as saying he and his colleague
would 'glean from the best of what we learned at Honda and put it to use to
help BMW'.
Mercedes has an additional reason for putting its new plant in the US. The
vehicle to be built there represents a new departure for the company, into
the fast-growing sports utility segment of the market, which includes
products such as Britain's Range Rover and Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee.
The US is by far the largest and most innovative market for such vehicles,
having seen sales grow from a mere 240,000 units in 1980 to 1.1m in 1992.
Mercedes makes a four-wheeled drive vehicle, in Austria, but this primarily
serves military markets and production is being phased out.
However, manufacturing in America involves risks for the two companies,
which are only too well aware of the fate of compatriot Volkswagen, which
invested in a US plant in the late 1970s, only to pull out in 1988 after
heavy losses, due to weak productivity and a reputation for poor quality at
its Pennsylvanian plant.
A challenge for BMW and Mercedes is to retain the prestige of their cars for
quality, while losing their Made in Germany tag. This may be easier for
Mercedes, since the company has experience of manufacturing in the US and
other world markets through its commercial vehicle division.
In the US, it owns Freightliner, which last year for the first time became
the top-selling truck in the heavy Class 8 category, taking a 23 per cent
market share. Freightliner's former chief executive, Mr Dieter Zetsche, was
promoted last year to head passenger car engineering worldwide.
Mercedes is taking a risk with the type of vehicle it is building in the US.
Entry to the sports utility market is one of the first results of a change
in corporate strategy which is to involve it in a broader range of products.
The four-wheel-drive vehicle, will be aimed at the middle of the US market,
against competitors such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer,
selling in the Dollars 20,000 to Dollars 30,000 range, rather than the Range
Rover, at over Dollars 40,000.
'There are excellent opportunities to position ourselves with our quality
and safety philosophy as a premium car producer in these new market
segments,' says Mr Werner.
However, the sports utility segment is crowded and fashion-conscious, and
Mercedes is not known for reacting rapidly to changing consumer tastes. The
US venture could prove a tough test of its new strategy.

FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Pechiney first-half loss warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY, France's state-controlled packaging and aluminium group, warned
yesterday that it would make a loss in the first half of this year. Group
profit last year dropped sharply to FFr203m (Dollars 36.9m) from FFr820m in
1991.
Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's president, said he would like 'to use the first
window that opens up' for France's new government to privatise his group,
but the low price of aluminium, Pechiney's main raw material, might delay
this.
The poor showing stemmed largely from competition from what Mr Gandois
called 'massive amounts' of Russian aluminium. Last year, the group took
over the aluminium activities of Pechiney International, its publicly-traded
subsidiary of which it owns 67 per cent, to make Pechiney International more
attractive to investors.
Pechiney International's operational profit rose 19 per cent from FFr901 in
1991 to FFr1.07bn.
Some 85 per cent of this subsidiary's FFr35.3bn turnover last year was in
packaging, mainly of food and drinks. That allowed it to maintain its level
of profitability. The rest, however, was in turbine components, where
profitability, was cut from FFr675m in 1991 to FFr344m last year.
Pechiney is maintaining a FFr5-a-share dividend for its international
operation, but cutting its group dividend from FFr13 for 1991 to FFr10 for
last year.
Mr Gandois forecast that the Pechiney group would see the benefit of recent
restructuring in the second half of this year, while Pechiney
International's profit would rise further this year, though by a smaller
margin than last year.

Bensons Crisps, the snack food manufacturer, is raising Pounds 5.3m net
through a 5-for-4 rights issue at 58p to finance a planned factory in
Kirkham, Lancashire.
The shares fell 6p on the announcement to close at 66p.
Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said the move was 'Bensons' bid to become
significantly larger as the UK's number four manufacturer of snack foods'.
He admitted that the timing of the rights issue, a week after the company
reported pre-tax profits halved at Pounds 500,000, was poor.
The group is switching from the USM to the Official List.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an improved second half performance, Metsec, the USM-quoted
building, electronic and engineering products concern, turned in higher
pre-tax losses of Pounds 731,000 in 1992, against Pounds 257,000 previously.
Turnover fell from Pounds 79.8m to Pounds 60.2m.
US and Australian losses had a sizeable impact on results, but those losses
had been stemmed and prospects for a return to profits had improved.
Overall, the group's profitable trend had continued into 1993.
Gearing stood at 65.7 per cent and it remained the group's priority to
reduce this to more acceptable levels. Losses per share increased from 2.07p
to 5.59p, and there is no dividend (6.4p).

Platon International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group, has decided to

The alternative is 25p per share, which compares with Wills' offer of five

The offer has been declared final in the absence of a competitive situation.
The company already owns or has announced valid acceptances in respect of
1.8m shares (16.91 per cent) and after taking into account anticipated
acceptances will control 40.32 per cent.
If the offer is declared unconditional, Mr Robin Bromley-Martin, Platon's

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bletchley Motor 63% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLETCHLEY MOTOR lifted turnover 17 per cent and saw a surge in pre-tax
profit of 63 per cent in 1992.
Turnover rose from Pounds 60.2m to Pounds 70.4m and profit worked through to
Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 753,000). With earnings per share at 19.6p (15.3p) the
dividend is raised from 8.2p to 8.8p, with a final of 4.4p.
Commenting on the current year Mr David Dunn, chairman, said the performance
in the first quarter had continued on from 1992, with profit-ability ahead
of budget.
Mr Dunn said the contract hire division continued to grow and there was a
recovery in fleet sales. In the private sector an increase in sales volume
of nearly new vehicles more than compensated for the reduction in new sales.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation and disposal costs put Aegis
Pounds 1.9m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and
planning group, yesterday reported 1992 pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.9m,
compared with restated profits of Pounds 54.4m.
The group's figures - which were produced under FRS 3 - were badly hit by
Pounds 22m losses through reorganisation, and another Pounds 22m cost on the
sale of discontinued activities.
Turnover increased 35 per cent to Pounds 2.84bn (Pounds 2.1bn). No final
dividend will be paid, making 1.375p for the year (5.85p). No dividends on
ordinary shares will be paid in 1993. Losses per share were 19.9p, compared
with earnings of 20.4p.
Net average debt was up from Pounds 35m to Pounds 68m at the end of the
year.
Excluding interest, operating expenses in 1992 were Pounds 138.6m, or 4.9
per cent of turnover, against Pounds 120.2m (restated under FRS 3), or 5.7
per cent of turnover in 1991.
Aegis plans to reduce operating expenses this year to 1991's figure.
Operating margins were down at 6.7 per cent (8.5 per cent). Staff levels are
due to fall again in 1993, from 1,850 to 1,660, and it is planned to further
consolidate the group's offices, reducing them from 59 to 46 across Europe.
In June 1992 problems surfaced concerning Aegis' financial stability. Mr
Peter Scott, its chairman, left and Sir Frank Law took over. Sir Frank said
yesterday that while the reorganisation costs were high, financial control
had been restored to the company and that no further sizeable restructurings
were planned.
Mr Charles Hochman, chief executive, said he believed the group had two
distinct advantages over competitors, an established 'qualitative system' to
assist advertisers buy media space more efficiently, and a genuine
pan-European network.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 25m-Pounds 28m
for 1993.
COMMENT
While new managerial controls have been put in place at Aegis, there are
considerable uncertainties in its largest market, France, following the
passage of the Loi Sapin Bill on March 31. In 1992 France was again Aegis'
largest market by far, accounting for Pounds 791.8m of group turnover. But
the Loi Sapin, aimed at bringing greater transparency to the French
media-buying business, is likely to erode media-buying revenues by anything
between 10 per cent and 40 per cent. The extent to which Aegis will suffer
is as yet a matter of speculation. While analysts are forecasting a return
to pre-tax profits in 1993, operating margins may shrink to just 2 per cent.
However, 9 months ago it appeared that Aegis' acquisition-driven growth of
the 1980s might result in the collapse of the company. That is no longer an
immediate prospect.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Expanded Frost jumps to Pounds 5.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROST GROUP, the independent petrol retailer that floated free of the
Norfolk House receivership in 1991, yesterday reported a 78 per cent
increase in earnings per share after a year in which it dramatically
increased the number of new sites.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5.75m on sales up 50 per
cent at Pounds 124m. Reported earnings per share before the February 1993
scrip issue rose from 13.4p to 23.8p.
The group added 57 new sites during the year, bringing the total to 143.
Mr James Frost, chairman, said low gearing would allow the group to continue
to make acquisitions. '1994 should either bring more sites at reasonable
prices or a recovery in margins as new sites become more mature, or both,'
he said.
He warned, however, that recession was not yet over and that margins would
remain under pressure. He anticipated that the forecourt shop would in
future replace the 'familiar corner shop'. The group would therefore place
more emphasis on its shop facilities.
The final dividend is 2.2p, making a total of 4.03p after adjusting for the
scrip, compared with 0.667p for the two months of the previous year that the
group was quoted.
After the scrip, earnings rose from 4.4p to 7.9p.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Provisions of Pounds 7.9m leave Wilkes with
Pounds 6.4m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL and extraordinary provisions at James Wilkes finally totalled
Pounds 7.9m for 1992 and pushed the group into a net attributable loss of
Pounds 6.41m, compared to a profit of Pounds 950,000 in 1991.
Mr Arthur Watt, chairman, said the year was turbulent and marked by the
successful defence against the bid from Petrocon, significant alterations to
group structure, and board changes.
He believed that group was now well focused and in good shape to take full
advantage of an upturn in trading conditions. 'We have an impressive
portfolio of specialist engineering businesses and a group which is
structured for growth', he added.
With 50 per cent of current turnover exported, the recent depreciation of
sterling should result in increased turnover and improved margins,
particularly at Floform and at Stubs. Central overheads were running at some
Pounds 2m per year lower than a year ago.
To illustrate the new structure, pro forma figures for the ongoing
businesses showed turnover of Pounds 41.3m producing a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 2.17m, with earnings per share at 7.8p.
Mr Watt also announced that Mr Doug Rogers, chairman of Newman Tonks and of
Savage, had agreed to become chairman of Wilkes from April 16. That fulfils
the undertaking given that the roles of chairman and chief executive would
be separated. Mr Philip Gothard, company secretary, will join the board as
finance director.
As a reflection of the assessment of prospects for continuing operations and
the wish to reduce borrowings further, the dividend is cut from 10p to 3.5p.
The proposed final is reduced from 5.25p to 0.25p. Losses per share were
7.2p (earnings of 4.6p).
Turnover came to Pounds 49m (Pounds 54.3m) and operating profit to Pounds
4.28m (Pounds 7.97m). There was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.58m (profit
Pounds 1.89m) after exceptionals of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.76m).
Main constituents of the exceptionals were compensation for loss of office
Pounds 1.08m, reorganisation, set-up and aborted acquisition costs Pounds
751,000, and bad debts and related stock write off Pounds 464,000.
The extraordinaries, taken below the line, were Pounds 5.23m and comprised
surplus on sale of promotional products division Pounds 4.75m, write back of
goodwill Pounds 7.6m, loss on disposal of aviation division Pounds 728,000,
write back of goodwill Pounds 163,000, and bid defence costs Pounds 1.47m.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ipeco suffers from lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IPECO HOLDINGS, the Southend-on-Sea aerospace and defence equipment group,
showed little overall change in 1992, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m,
against Pounds 3.38m.
Sales rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19.9m and operating profit from Pounds
2.92m to Pounds 3.06m, but that was counterbalanced by a reduction from
Pounds 458,000 to Pounds 234,000 in treasury operations as interest rates
fell.
Earnings per share dipped to 7.72p (8.18p). Having regard to the continuing
strength of the operating profit and ungeared balance sheet, the dividend is
stepped up from 3.4p to 3.6p, the final being 2.3p.
On the future Mr Christopher Johnson, chairman, believed the main part of
order rescheduling activity by large airframe makers had been completed, and
the group could have some 'reasonable confidence' in the delivery
projections of the core aerospace equipment business.
There was evidence of increasing customer demand in the defence and aircraft
maintenance and refurbishment activities, he said.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Burmah to pay Dollars 48m for ICI
lubricants offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, has agreed to pay
Dollars 48.3m (Pounds 31.7m) for Tribol, an ICI subsidiary which makes and
markets industrial lubricants internationally.
Tribol, which employs about 300 people, has manufacturing plants in the US
and Germany. It also has wholly owned operations in Canada, Chile, France,
Italy, Mexico and Spain, as well as distributors in 50 other countries.
Burmah is funding the acquisition through a placing by Schroders of 4.5m new
shares with institutions at 705p. Burmah's shares closed 16p lower at 732p.
Burmah said the acquisition was not expected to dilute earnings and would
complement the group's existing activities in industrial lubricants. It
would fit particularly well with Optimpol, the German speciality grease and
lubricants manufacturer it bought in 1990.
Tribol was acquired by ICI in 1985 as part of the Beatrice Chemical
purchase.
It is being sold by Zeneca, ICI's bioscience arm, which is about to be
demerged. ICI said: 'While Tribol is a strong business with a good
reputation, it was not a strategic business for Zeneca Specialities and
should have greater opportunity to flourish within Burmah Castrol.'
Tribol had sales of Dollars 53m last year and made pre-tax profits of
Dollars 3.7m, which were depressed by exceptional restructuring costs of
about Dollars 1.3m. It had net assets of Dollars 21m at the year-end.
Burmah said Tribol focused on products for arduous conditions in niche
markets. Its main industries were in the mining, automotive, steel, cement
and paper sectors. Its principal products were speciality greases, open-gear
lubricants, gear oils, and chain and wire lubricants.
The industrial speciality lubricants market is worth an estimated Dollars
1bn and is highly fragmented. Burmah said competitors tended to be only
regional or nationally oriented, and the acquisition of Tribol would make
the group a world leader in this sector.

Inishtech, the Irish hygiene products, printing and packaging group, lifted
profits from IPounds 7.09m to IPounds 7.28m pre-tax over the 12 months to
December 31.

Douthwaites Florists Sundries, acquired in May; excluding the purchase,
sales rose 9 per cent and operating profits dipped 10 per cent.
Net borrowings at the year-end were IPounds 7.3m giving gearing of 16 per
cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 37p (36.4p); the single distribution
for the year is raised to 6.05p (5.5p).
James Crean, the industrial holding company, controls 69.35 per cent of the

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Torday &amp; Carlisle Pounds 13m in red and
passes dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the Newcastle-based engineer, yesterday announced a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.3m for 1992 and passed its final divi- dend for
the first time in a decade.
The result, which compared with profits of Pounds 25,000, was heavily
influenced by exceptional items relating mainly to Oldham Signs, for which
the group failed to find a buyer last year.
A provision of Pounds 8.21m for goodwill previously set off against reserves
on the acquisition five years ago of Oldham was transferred to the profit
and loss account, following reassessment of its underlying value.
The group stressed the transfer had no effect on shareholders' funds or
group borrowings.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 3.47m for reorganisation costs included
Pounds 2.6m for the restructuring, completed in late December, of the sign
subsidiary.
Operating losses were Pounds 679,000 (profits of Pounds 1.44m) on turnover
of Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 42.8m). Year end gearing rose to 109 per cent. Bank
borrowing facilities have been agreed for 1993.
Shareholders' approval is to be sought 'as soon as appropriate' for a
reorganisation of parent company reserves, said to be necessary before a
return to the dividend list.
Mr Paul Torday, chief executive, described 1992 as a 'grim' year for the
group and said it had decided it would be prudent to 'take the hit' this
year rather than be faced with write-offs should it sell Oldham in the
future.
DMI, the engine repair business, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.1m
(Pounds 2.2m); Elfab Hughes, which makes pressure relief and safety
equipment, raised opera- ting profits to Pounds 775,000 (Pounds 718,000).
Oldham Signs incurred an operating loss of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 772,000); the
operating loss on central costs was Pounds 679,000 (Pounds 661,000). The
1991 figures were restated to include central costs.
Mr Torday said he expected DMI and Elfab Hughes to trade profitably this
year; the objective for Oldham, which is now exceeding sales targets, is to
break even.
The final is passed (3p) leaving no distribution (4.5p) for the year. Losses
per share were 81.8p (4.58p), or 30.8p (4.58p) before the goodwill
provision.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: City Centre shows 24% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIZZA gluttons piled on the pounds at City Centre Restaurants which
yesterday announced a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.1m
to Pounds 11.3m for the year to December 31.
Mr Bruce Johnston, chairman of the company, which owns the Deep Pan Pizza
and Garfunkels chains, said covers rose to 13.5m - a 9.4 per cent increase,
partly because of the October 1991 introduction of cheap all-you-can-eat
pizza and pasta buffets.
Turnover increased by more than 12 per cent to Pounds 89.6m (Pounds 79.8m).
The pre-tax figure was helped by improved interest receivable of Pounds
574,000 (Pounds 62,000). This reflected cash resources of Pounds 11m with no
borrowings amassed as a result of a reduced programme of just six new
outlets last year.
There was also a reduced loss on property disposals of Pounds 21,000 (Pounds
190,000).
A Pounds 296,000 (Pounds 60,000) extraordinary charge related to the
disposal of a stake in Cullens, the up-market grocer. Cullens had been meant
as an outlet for the Belhaven brewery, which the group sold in 1988.
The charge will next year be deducted from the Pounds 11.3m pre-tax figure.
The new FRS 3 accounting standard which virtually bans extraordinary items
means this year's figures will have to be re-stated for comparison in next
year's results.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 1.12p (1.01p) which makes
a total for the year of 1.57p (1.46p). The dividend is payable from
increased earnings per share of 4.14p against 3.79p.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Independent Newspapers doubles to IPounds
16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish publishing group, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits doubled from IPounds 7.97m to IPounds 16m for the year to
December 25.
The outcome was struck after exceptional items of IPounds 1.23m (IPounds
3.37m) related to continuing rationalisation costs.
Turnover increased to IPounds 169.9m (IPounds 155.8m); opera-ting profit
jumped 45 per cent to IPounds 23.4m (IPounds 16.2m).
Higher advertising volumes increased the group's market share in Ireland as
growth in circulation revenues also improved profitability of domestic
newspaper operations.
In the UK, the publishing side incurred a small loss but was now showing
signs of improvement, said Mr Liam Healy, chief execu- tive.
The results included a maiden six month contribution of IPounds 3.1m from
Australian Provincial Newspapers, where the group increased its indirect
interest to 20 per cent last July.
Net interest charges rose from IPounds 2.53m to IPounds 3.08m. The group
said it will shortly be relieved from bond servicing costs which amounted to
IPounds 1.8m in 1992.
A final dividend of 10p makes 15.5p (14p) for the year. Fully diluted
earnings per share increased 64 per cent to 32.67p (19.93p).
A 2-for-3 scrip issue is also proposed.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Manchester United scores 45% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER United followed up a victory against football championship rivals
Norwich City with the announcement yesterday of a 45 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits.
Both sets of results helped push up the share price by a further 10p to
412p, a 46 per cent increase in the past six months and 27p ahead of the
June 1991 flotation price.
With net spending on players reduced by nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds 285,000,
pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 3.17m) in the six months to
January 31. The purchase of Dion Dublin and Eric Cantona, for Pounds 1m
each, was offset by the sale of Neil Webb, Mark Robins and Mal Donaghy.
Before transfer fees and interest income of Pounds 559,000 (Pounds 614,000),
operating profit declined to Pounds 4.34m (Pounds 4.79m) on turnover of
Pounds 13m (Pounds 12.4m). Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, said the club
had fared less well in cup competitions and played two fewer home games.
A breakdown of first-half sales showed a decline in gate receipts and ground
advertising. The latter reflects the smaller television audiences for live
Premier League football since its switch to BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster.
Television, shop and conference income all advanced.
Mr Edwards said building work on the Stretford End of the Old Trafford
ground had reduced capacity to 33,000 for the first part of the season. This
had been offset by price increases averaging 30 per cent.
Capacity had gone up to 37,000, yielding Pounds 600,000 per game. Next
season it would be 45,000, adding at least 10 per cent to match income even
though prices were being held. All 46 of the new stand's executive boxes had
been sold for the 1993-94 season.
After paying about half the Pounds 10m cost of the stand, United still had
Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 12.8m) cash in the bank.
Earnings per share rose to 25.8p (17.9p before switching funds from the
transer fee reserve and 24p afterwards).
The interim dividend is held at 6p.
COMMENT
With twice as many games in the first half as the second, the bulk of
United's 1992-93 profits are already in the bag. But some tantalising
variables remain. One is the league championship, worth Pounds 850,000 to
the winner and guaranteeing lucrative European football next season.
Ironically the bonuses due to champions would make it more immediately
profitable to come second or third. On the debit side, the purchase of
another star player could keep full-year pre-tax profits flat at about
Pounds 5m. This gives a prospective p/e of about 14, a sign that United is
at last being taken seriously by the market. It deserves it for strong cash
management and the increasingly slick exploitation of its stadium and brand.
If it wins the championship the price could rise further, even after a run
that would have done Ryan Giggs proud.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Gartland and Whalley set up new company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTREPRENEURS Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeffrey Whalley are part of a team
which yesterday set up a new group by bringing together a coin handling
equipment maker and an optical products manufacturer for Pounds 24m.
The move is the first of significance made by the previously high-profile
pair in their latest vehicle, the Gartland and Whalley company.
Mr Gartland and Mr Whalley, as directors of the FKI engineering company,
presided over its acquisition-led high growth rates in the 1980s, including
the purchase of Babcock, the contracting company in 1987 - a deal which was
undone some two years later.
Mr Gartland and Mr Whalley left executive employment with FKI in 1989. Mr
Whalley remains FKI chairman.
The new company, which the backers hope to float within the next 12 months,
acquired its main subsidiary, Coin Controls Group, for Pounds 20m cash. Mr
Richard Williams, CCG chief executive is to be managing director.
The new group acquired the Slough-based Combined Optical Industries Ltd for
more than Pounds 3m of equity. Gartland and Whalley bought COIL in 1990.
Total funding is made up of Pounds 10.5m senior debt supplied by Bank of
Scotland. Gartland and Whalley contributed more than half of the Pounds 9.5m
equity capital with Granville Development Capital making up the balance and
Kleinwort Benson's European Mezzanine Fund contributing Pounds 4m.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Midland Bank pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK paid Pounds 1.46m in severance to two directors who left last
year, it was disclosed yesterday. Mr Gene Lockhart, head of group
operations, received Pounds 735,658, and Mr George Loudon, chief executive
of Midland Montagu, Pounds 720,000.
The severance payment of Mr Lockhart, who was the highest paid British
banker before he left Midland last July following its acquisition by HSBC
Holdings, included Pounds 265,873 as a contribution to a bank pension
scheme.
Mr Lockhart was paid Pounds 398,128 in 1991, while Mr Loudon received
between Pounds 420,000 and Pounds 425,000. Mr Lockhart returned to the US to
become president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group after leaving
Midland.
The bank, which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 178m (Pounds 36m) for 1992,
paid Pounds 2.2m to directors during the year against Pounds 2.5m in 1991
following the departures of Mr Lockhart and Mr Loudon.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive who joined the bank in the middle
of 1991 from Barclays, was Midland's highest paid director, earning Pounds
342,393. Sir Peter Walters, Midland's chairman, was paid Pounds 200,000.
The earnings of Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society, fell to Pounds 280,936 last year against Pounds
306,041 the previous year. The society did not pay a performance bonus to
its directors.
Pre-tax profits at C&amp;G, the sixth biggest society, fell to Pounds 130.6m
(Pounds 183.8m) in 1992.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach gets Pounds 134m market value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH, the Scottish-based company which operates bus services in the UK
and Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is coming to the market via a placing and
offer valuing the company at Pounds 134m.
Some 11.7m shares priced at 112p will be offered to the public and a further
21.8m will be placed with institutions. The company aims to raise some
Pounds 20.6m to fund acquisitions.
The offer and placing have been fully underwritten by Noble Grossart.
Stagecoach, founded by a brother and sister team in 1980 to take advantage
of the privatisation of Britain's bus services, forecast pre-tax profits at
least 56 per cent ahead to Pounds 12.8m for the year ended April 30.
Earnings per shares are forecast to be not less than 7.8p for 1993. The
company said the offer price represented a prospective p/e of 14.4.
The notional dividend of 3.8p for 1993 offered a yield of 4.2 per cent.
The allocation of the offer will be announced on April 20, and dealings are
expected to commence on April 27.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman, and his sister Mrs Ann Gloag, managing director,
will own 56 per cent of Stagecoach after flotation.
COMMENT
The pricing of this issue has been finely tuned, leaving little chance of
the stock opening to what some have called a 'monster premium'. The UK
businesses, considered to be the gold in the Stagecoach carriage, appear to
be on a market rating. Looking further out, investors might find difficulty
with marketability, since the industry is relatively unknown to the City.
There are also questions about the quality of the overseas businesses and
the UK regulatory environment, with the government already muttering about
some industry practices. On the other hand, Mr Souter and Mrs Gloag have
proven themselves to be class managers and, more importantly, have a
successful track record. There is much to go for, with some 30 per cent of
the UK bus market left to be privatised. The issue is almost certain to
receive enthusiastic support.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Simons, chief executive of Isosceles, used the pressure of worried
trade creditors to speed up the restructuring process.
If it had gone on much longer there was a risk that they might have refused
to extend credit, knowing that Isosceles' debt standstill agreement runs out
on May 28.
In the event Mr Simons believes the restructuring is as good as he could
have got. Yet questions remain about Gateway's future performance.
The business plan forecasts that Gateway will record a Pounds 105m operating
profit in the financial year to end-April, compared with a Pounds 187.4m
profit in 1991-92. Profits are expected to fall again - by as much as Pounds
30m - before they recover.
Although the expected interest charge of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m
will be easily met by operating profits, it remains a drain on resources.
Last year the like-for-like sales decline was 6 per cent steepening to 8 per
cent in the past two months. The sales reductions in the core Gateway stores
was in low double figures.
Mr Simons blamed the sales decline on 'competitive attrition'. He conceded
it was 'horrible' but remained confident that it would get better. 'We have
five years in which to prove ourselves.'
But most analysts do not believe there will be any significant improvement
in the short-term.
The 1992-93 figures will also bear interest charges, including rolled up
interest, of Pounds 153m, and 'kitchen sink' provisions covering
restructuring, property write-downs, fees for the refinancing and other
items, taking the pre-tax loss to Pounds 335m.
In response to the problems Mr Simons has reordered the investment
priorities within the company.
Most attention will focus on the 500 core Gateway stores. The Food Giant
discount superstore chain will be doubled to about 40 stores, while the
expansion of the Somerfield chain has been put on temporary hold.
Mr Simons priority is to ensure the shops are properly stocked and pricing
becomes more competitive. A rolling refurbishment programme of the main
chain of stores is also underway.
He plans to merge most of the different business units within Gateway's head
office in Bristol to make a more efficient organisation.
Even if the business plan proceeds as smoothly and efficiently as Mr Simons
hopes, a possible flotation of the stores in three to five years in unlikely
to raise more than Pounds 500m, although the company says it has no price in
mind.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: RJB Mining brings flotation forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB MINING, the Nottinghamshire-based coal mining group, has brought forward
its floatation to May or June to take advantage of the impending
privatisation of British Coal.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said: 'The planned flotation will help us
expand the group's business at a time when there are significant
opportunities for private mining companies to operate underground mines
which BC will cease to run.'
Before the government's recent white paper on coal, the company was expected
to float at the end of 1993 or the beginning of next year. The white paper
said BC must license to the private sector any pits it does not want.
The flotation is expected to capitalise the company at more than Pounds
100m. In the year to December 31 it increased operating profits from Pounds
14.2m to Pounds 16.4m on sales of Pounds 73.9m.
RJB has signed a five year contract to supply National Power and an interim
agreement to supply PowerGen. Last year it produced 1.9m tonnes of coal,
equivalent to about 10 per cent of UK opencast coal production.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Laird improves to Pounds 36.2m - High
exposure to German car producers but devaluation helps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAIRD GROUP, maker of car components and industrial products, yesterday
reported sharply higher profits for 1992 as investments in plant that
supplies new models came on stream.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 36.2m, on sales up 15 per
cent at Pounds 600.7m.
The results have been prepared on the basis of FRS 3 accounting principles.
Profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 39.5m.
Earnings on this basis rose 21 per cent to 20.8p.
Earnings per share under FRS 3 rose from 12.3p to 18.7p; the company has
already declared a second interim of 6.3p, giving a total for the year of
10.5p, up 3 per cent.
Mr John Gardiner, chairman, said demand from the auto industry would be
lower in continental Europe this year, where Laird has a particularly high
exposure to German car producers, but sterling's devaluation would help
offset this effect.
The fall in volume should to some extent be offset by the increased value
added of products being fitted to new models.
The big increase came in the sealing systems division where operating
profits rose from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 23m on sales up 26 per cent at
Pounds 223.9m.
Industrial products, which are also mainly directed towards the auto
industry, rose sharply to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 12.7m) on sales up 17 per
cent at Pounds 178m.
Profits in the service industries division, however, fell from Pounds 10.1m
to Pounds 7.8m on sales up slightly at Pounds 179.8m.
The US printing operations suffered a setback and the group had to
reorganiseits plastics distributiondivision.
Following last year's rights issue, interest charges fell from Pounds 8.4m
to Pounds 6.8m and gearing was about 10 per cent.
COMMENT
On the face of it, Laird's markets look less than healthy. German car
production could well be down 20 per cent this year. Even if the group is
appearing on the 'right' models, like the new Astra, VW and Peugeot, the
group cannot avoid the effect of a slow down in car production elsewhere in
Europe. What is more, Laird's US sales indicate that the market is not
recovering as robustly as some have suggested. As a result, profits are
likely to be flat at Pounds 36m this year, giving earnings of 18.3p,
stripping out the Pounds 5m settlement proceeds from a 10-year old
litigation. This puts the shares on a market rating of about 15 times. Laird
is, however, one of the few motor component companies not to have recovery
already factored into its share price. Should recovery not emerge on cue,
the company's sound dividend and yield premium might yet look tempting for
investors wanting exposure to motors.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Steering committee approves new figures for
FT-SE indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee yesterday approved the
calculation of total return figures for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE
Actuaries 350, FT-SE SmallCap and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices.
Daily publication of these figures in the FT will start on July 1.
Extracts from the committee's announcement follow:
'The total return figures will be able to take account of both price
performance and income received from dividends and will provide a way for
investors to judge more accurately the return on their investments. The new
figures will be calculated gross of tax and will assume that the dividend
and tax credit are reinvested immediately on the ex-dividend date. The
published ex-dividend data will also allow investors to calculate the
figures net of tax.
'The figures will be calculated at the close of each trading day, and will
be published in the Financial Times and on Topic.
'Donald Brydon, chairman of the committee, said: 'Investors, both
professional and private, will now be able to compare the overall
performance of their investments with a recognised standard for the first
time. The performance of fund managers is measured in terms of total return
on investment, rather than purely in terms of price movements in the market,
and the new figures reflect this.''
The method for calculating the total return indices was recommended by a
working party set up by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of
Actuaries, chaired by Mr David Wilkie of R Watson &amp; Son.

FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Losses mount as SHT tries to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH HERITABLE Trust, the mini-conglomerate, yesterday announced pre-tax
losses, including exceptional items, of Pounds 5.03m for 1992.
This compares with a Pounds 792,000 pre-tax loss last time but does not
include extraordinary charges of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 1.85m). These included
Pounds 9.3m in respect of goodwill attributable to businesses sold, where
previously it had been written off to reserves at the time of acquisition.
The charges also includes provisions for losses made on the disposal since
the start of 1993 of three companies and the write down of net assets of
other group companies to their current market value.
The sale during 1992 of Standard Fireworks and hospital bed manufacturer
Hoskins and non-consolidation in 1992 of turnover from Scottish Heritable
Inc, contributed to a drop in turnover to Pounds 44.6m (Pounds 96.5m). There
is no dividend.
The group's current level of debt is about Pounds 30m; its net assets are
Pounds 4.7m. Mr Stuart Macdonald, chief executive, confirmed that gearing is
currently about 600 per cent.
Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, said that while the banks continued to support
SHT they had made clear substantial additional reductions must be made in
the near future. Two disposals, understood to be of US-based operations, are
at an advanced stage of negotiation.
Mr Macdonald commented: 'Our first objective has to be to get our debt down
to an acceptable level and then see what is left.'
Losses per share before extraordinary items were 14p (1.5p), and 55.6p
(6.6p) including them.

FT  07 APR 93 / Increase in Tesco profits slows to 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS growth at Tesco, the UK's second-largest grocery chain, dropped
below 10 per cent last year for the first time in nine years, as the company
warned that food retailing was still in the grip of recession.
Pre-tax profits for the year to February 27 rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds
580.9m - the smallest increase since the 19.6 per cent rise reported for
1983.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said sales had been disappointing in the first
half but improved over Christmas and the new year, helping annual turnover,
including VAT, to rise 7 per cent to Pounds 8.1bn.
The stronger performance had continued into the current year, with
year-on-year sales growth running at about 9 per cent. Sir Ian warned that
food retailing was likely to continue to suffer from the recession until
later in the year: 'I know that the country is supposedly coming out of
recession, but we were the last into it, and it will be some time yet before
we see any benefits.'
Sir Ian was pleased with Tesco's 14.7 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 577.2m, given the difficult economic climate, and a half-point
rise in the operating margin to 7.6 per cent.
The advance in profits would, he said, benefit the company's 48,000 staff to
the extent of Pounds 25.5m through Tesco's profit-sharing scheme.
The improvement showed that Tesco's investment in scanning equipment and
sales-based ordering systems, as well as a reorganisation of its retail
management structure, was bearing fruit. Tesco increased its market share
from 9.4 per cent to 9.7 per cent.
Analysts were disappointed that the increase in operating profits was not
matched by the rise in pre-tax profits - which were depressed by a large
drop in net interest receivable from Pounds 65.5m to Pounds 31.5m,
reflecting the continuing investment in new stores. There was also a net
loss on sale of properties of Pounds 2.3m.
A final dividend of 4.85p gave a total of 7.1p - an increase of 12.7 per
cent - although earnings rose only 5.1 per cent to 20.97p. The shares gained
1p to 232p.
Some 25 new stores were opened last year and were performing 'above
expectations'. Tesco plans to open another 25 stores this year, including
both superstores and its new city-centre Metro format, but capital
expenditure will be only Pounds 750m compared with about Pounds 950m a year
in the late 1980s.

FT  07 APR 93 / Queens Moat creditors to be told about loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT Houses' 60 bank creditors will today be told that the
international hotel group made a loss last year, but that it still has a
'sizeable net asset value', bankers said yesterday.
The emergency bank meeting, which has been arranged by the UK bank Barclays,
will hear preliminary details of an investigation of the group's affairs by
accountants Grant Thornton.
Bankers will be told this afternoon that Queens Moat made a loss in 1992,
compared with their expectations a fortnight ago that it had made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 80m. The loss, which Grant Thornton has not quantified
precisely, has been caused by a re-examination of Queens Moat's accounting
policies and of management incentive contracts.
Under these contracts, Queens Moat's managers guaranteed that their hotels
would generate specified revenues and the company then booked these future
revenues as profits. However, much of this revenue was never paid, so the
company has to write off 'tens of millions' of previously reported profits,
a banker said.
Grant Thornton will also recommend changes to a series of Queens Moat's
accounting policies, leading to a further drop in Queens Moat's profits.
The accountants believe that the gross value of the group's hotel assets has
fallen sharply from more than Pounds 2bn last summer. However, a banker said
the fall was likely to be less than 25 per cent and he was confident the
company had positive net assets.
Barclays has asked the banks to suspend principal and interest payments on
Pounds 1bn of debt pending the completion of Grant Thornton's inquiries.
However, banks will be told they are unlikely to suffer big loan losses. A
debt restructuring proposal is expected to be made in a few weeks, whose
main element will be a request to reschedule principal repayments for
several years on two main facilities:
A Pounds 415m multiple facility, converted into D-Marks and due for
repayment in November.
A DM550m (Pounds 226m) revolving facility, signed last August and maturing
in four years.
The facilities were arranged by National Westminster Bank, though Barclays
will chair today's meeting. Each has an exposure to Queens Moat of at least
Pounds 80m. Several German banks are exposed, including Dresdner,
WestDeutsche Landesbank, Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank.

FT  07 APR 93 / US bid values TIP Europe at Pounds 71m: Angus Foster on GE
Capital's move into European trailer rental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric of
the US, yesterday made a recommended cash offer for TIP Europe, the trailer
rental company.
The 42p a share cash bid values TIP Europe at Pounds 71m, a premium to its
recent share price but well below its trading level before a refinancing
crisis in 1991. GE Capital is the largest trailer rental company in the US
and has been looking to expand in Europe since 1991.
Mr David Callear, chief executive, TIP Europe, said the price offered was
'reasonably healthy'. He said UK business was improving, but the outlook on
the continent was poor. The offer 'brings an immediate confidence to the
business', he said.
TIP Europe's shares jumped from 25 1/2 p to 40 1/2 p, their highest level
since last year. The shares collapsed from 175p in 1990 when the company was
hit by the UK recession. GE Capital's offer price is pitched just above a
1991 five-for-six rights issue at 40p, which followed the refinancing.
The company's largest shareholder, the Dutch investment company HAL
Investments (UK) which holds 9.9 per cent, has said it will accept the offer
unless a higher bid is made. TIP Europe's directors, who hold 0.6 per cent,
have accepted the offer and recommended it to shareholders. Mr M van der
Vorm, a director in both companies, has expressed no view because of
potential conflicts of interest.
However, a large proportion of the shares are held by individuals and it is
unclear whether they will accept.
Tiphook, Europe's largest trailer rental company, holds a 5.4 per cent stake
in TIP Europe, which it took in 1991 when it feared GE Capital was about to
bid. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, Tiphook, said he was not surprised by the
offer. He said a rival bid from Tiphook would raise monopoly questions.
TIP Europe yesterday announced a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
3.1m to Pounds 2.3m in the six months to January 31.
UK profits rose, helped by higher rental rates, but continental profits were
hit by falling volumes. Mobiel, a modular building supplier, performed
poorly.
Turnover fell from Pounds 54.9m to Pounds 52.7m while earnings slipped 43
per cent to 1.01p. The interim dividend was cut from 0.64p to 0.4p, which
shareholders will still receive under the offer.

FT  07 APR 93 / Gateway protected from all but Pounds 464m of Isosceles debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLED Gateway food retailing chain is to be ring-fenced from all but
Pounds 464m of the Pounds 1.4bn borrowing obligations of its parent
Isosceles as part of a restructuring announced yesterday. Under the terms of
the deal, Gateway Foodmarkets is to be managed through a newly created
holding company, Gateway Holdings.
It will assume responsibility for Pounds 500m of Isosceles' borrowings, of
which Pounds 464m will be drawn at completion of the restructuring. No
repayment will be due on this debt until 1998.
Gateway will also have a Pounds 50m two-year working capital facility.
Isosceles, formed in 1989 through a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out, is to have
its remaining debt of Pounds 923m restructured. The deal has to be approved
by all of the group's 38 banks by the end of May. Mr David Simons, chief
executive of Isosceles, said: 'We had to reach an agreement otherwise we
would have been fighting over a carcass rather than a living body. The deal
has lifted Pounds 1bn burden from our shoulders.'
The Gateway assets, which will continue to be owned by Isosceles, may be
floated in three to five years. They are valued at around Pounds 800m after
Pounds 150m of write-downs. Mr Simons said the restructuring would be
accompanied with a 'clean-out' of Isosceles' balance sheet.
Gateway is expected to report a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 300m for
the financial year ending this month after what Mr Simons called 'kitchen
sink provisions' covering the restructuring.
The banks face heavy losses on the remaining Isosceles debt as it is
restructured into Pounds 256m of senior facilities, Pounds 400m of deep
discount bonds and Pounds 267m of new Isosceles preference shares. Holders
of the bank debt will receive Pounds 196m of the senior facility, Pounds
267m of the bonds and Pounds 125m of preference shares and all Gateway's
debt.
Mezzanine holders are to get Pounds 60m of the senior debt, Pounds 133m of
the bonds and Pounds 142m of the preference shares. Existing dividend and A
ordinary shares are to be converted into ordinary shares.
Existing shareholders will own 45 per cent of the enlarged share capital and
mezzanine and senior lenders will own 45 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively.
A special share will be issued to the senior lenders giving them 51 per cent
of the votes at a general meeting.

FT  07 APR 93 / The coming struggle for a growth market: Angus Foster on GE
Capital's move into European trailer rental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For three years TIP Europe has been struggling as an also-ran in the
European trailer rental market. But yesterday's bid by GE Capital, if
successful, could kick-start the fortunes of the company and make for an
intriguing battle with the market leader, Tiphook.
First, though, GE Capital must convince TIP Europe's shareholders to accept
a bid when their company is close to the bottom of its cycle, at a price
where many will lose money.
One analyst said neither TIP Europe's shareholders nor its management would
be proud of the offer price. 'But how long can they wait before continental
Europe, and therefore the share price, recover?' he asked.
TIP Europe's troubles started in 1990 when, after two years of boisterous
expansion, it was hit by falling revenues in the UK as recession took hold.
The company breached a banking facility, which prompted a refinancing and
the arrival of a new chairman, Mr Jim Davis, and chief executive, Mr David
Callear.
Since then the company has fought to control costs and has been reducing its
fleet size, even though this means it will benefit less from an eventual
economic recovery since it will have to buy new vehicles. Analysts also
suspect it has neglected important spending on information technology and
allowed its fleet to grow old - its vehicles are on average 1.5 years older
than Tiphook's.
In the meantime, Tiphook has consolidated its position as European market
leader. It is estimated to have about 35 per cent of the market, compared
with 19 per cent for TIP Europe. Tiphook has more vehicles in all European
markets except Spain and has built up a dominant share of the important
German market.
GE Capital's entry into Europe had been expected since the expiry in 1991 of
a 'non-compete' agreement it inherited with the acquisition of Gelco, owner
of US trailer rental company Transport International Pool. This last company
had earlier sold TIP Europe to its management, so GE Capital's bid would
reunite the two halves of the operation.
Mr Robert Agans, chairman of GE Capital's modular space and TIP divisions,
said the plan was 'to grow TIP Europe as fast as we can'. This would include
annual spending of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m on new trailers, which would
conform to the latest EC specifications and be capable of cross border
rentals. The company would therefore move closer to Tiphook, which has
sought pan-European clients while TIP Europe saw Europe as a collection of
local markets.
Assuming a modest turnaround in Europe's economy, he expected the fleet to
grow from 17,000 to 23,000 trailers by 1997. This compares with Tiphook's
fleet of 33,000 vehicles.
GE Capital would also bring in from the US its own sales and marketing
executives, and some new management. Spending would be increased on
computers, although the company's US systems would be suitable.
'Competition with them (Tiphook) will get more intense, but it will be at
the service level, not the price level,' he said.
GE Capital and Tiphook already know each other well from the container
rental market. GE Capital's container rental division, Genstar, is the
largest in the world while Tiphook's is number two.
Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook, said the European and US
distribution markets were very different. 'We are already here in Europe and
have already built up a network,' he said. Nevertheless, Tiphook's shares
fell 25p to 335p on competition worries yesterday.
Both companies have room for growth in the longer term. Some analysts say
the continental trailer rental market is under-developed compared with
deregulated markets such as the US and UK. Rented trailers make up about 8
per cent of total European trailers, compared to about 25 per cent in the
US. The rest are owned. Although European barriers still exist - for example
cabotage prevents some cross border return trips - these barriers are slowly
coming down and most analysts expect the European figure to pass 15 per cent
by the end of the decade.
One analyst said GE Capital's entry into the market would be annoying for
Tiphook, but not necessarily damaging. 'These people are used to competing
and competition should open up the market quicker,' he said.

FT  07 APR 93 / Fisons shares hit by news of halted development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group,
yesterday revealed that development on its most promising compound had been
halted in a move casting fresh doubt on the company's long-term
independence. Fisons' shares fell 13 per cent from 194p to 169p in heavy
trading.
'We are bloody but unbowed,' said Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive. 'This
is a disappointment, but it would be utterly premature to write Fisons off
as a small but useful company in pharmaceuticals. Engineering of a
full-scale merger with another company is not on the board's agenda.' The
company was stopping development on tipredane, a steroid treatment for
asthma, because the drug had failed to show sufficient efficacy in trials.
Possibilities of a hostile bid following the announcement were dismissed by
analysts. 'This is hugely bad news for the company. It blows a hole in its
development pipeline,' said Mr Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals analyst at
Hoare Govett.
Last year the company stressed only two products in its development
pipeline, one of which was tipredane. Mr Scroggs would fill the gap left by
tipredane by licensing in an asthma drug from another company. 'We have had
lots of offers of other drugs in recent months that we have turned away. We
will go back to those groups.'
Fisons does not have a specialist salesforce to market its next most
promising compound, an anti-epileptic product called remacemide which is not
expected to be launched until 1998.

FT  07 APR 93 / House prices increase in linewith recent sales revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1.2 per cent in March, the largest monthly
increase for four years, the Halifax Building Society said yesterday.
The seasonally adjusted figures suggest that the recent revival in sales
reported by house builders, estate agents and building societies is starting
to have an impact on prices - although the society warned against reading
too much into one month's figures.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, nonetheless welcomed the figures,
saying they provided further encouraging signs of recovery in the
construction industry.
Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, said: 'Whilst this a very
encouraging sign that the housing market is beginning to recover we will
need a few more months of strong activity and stable or rising prices before
we can be confident that a sustained upturn is under way.'
Halifax said the 1.2 per cent rise was the biggest since March 1989 when
prices increased by 1.6 per cent. Before seasonal adjustment the figure
represented a 2.2 per cent increase.
Nationwide, the second largest building society, last week reported that
house prices had risen by 1 per cent in March compared with February, on an
unadjusted basis.
Despite this, the average price of a house in the UK of Pounds 61,510 last
month was still 5.2 per cent lower than in March last year.
Halifax, however, was encouraged that the rise in inquiries from potential
purchasers seen since the beginning of this year was starting to work
through to increased mortgage applications and offers.
The value of new commitments to mortgages by building societies rose by 40
per cent in February from January.
House builders say net reservations - agreed sales on which a deposit has
been paid less cancellations - have risen by between a fifth and a quarter
compared with the first 13 weeks of last year.
Halifax said that despite last month's increase it was sticking to its
forecast that prices would generally remain flat during the next few months
before starting to rise towards the end of this year. Nevertheless, some
stability seemed to be returning to prices, slightly earlier than expected.
The team which previously prepared construction forecasts for the National
Economic Development Office says the decline in construction output this
year is likely to be less than expected because of the recovery in the
housing market.
JFC Construction Forecasts said yesterday it had reduced its forecast for
the decline in output to 1.5 per cent from 2 per cent previously. It said
housing repair, maintenance and improvement work was likely to increase
because of increased confidence in the market. This would boost total
construction output.

FT  07 APR 93 / Government under pressure from EC over works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK yesterday began to push for European Community approval for a
directive that would force many big British companies operating on the
continent to set up elected works councils.
The Danes want agreement by June, when they end their six months' term as
president of the EC. The Danish government is anxious for progress to
persuade Danish voters in next month's referendum on European union that the
EC can deliver acceptable social and work standards.
Britain is the only member state hostile to the measure. It would require a
works council to be set up by all companies - including those based outside
the EC - if they employ more than 1,000 people in more than one of the EC's
12 member states (with more than 100 in at least two of the states).
The works councils would have to be consulted on such issues as job changes,
new technology, investment and any relocation of business.
After talks between employment and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg
yesterday, it became clear that Britain faces a fight to dilute the measure,
or see it passed by its 11 partners, assuming the Maastricht treaty on
European union and its social protocol come into force later this year.
If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did from the
Maastricht social chapter, the works council requirements would go through
without the British if and when the treaty is ratified.
If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies
would be among those most affected. According to British calculations, more
than 100 UK companies' operations in continental Europe would be affected if
the 11 decided to press ahead on their own.
But if the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 British companies
would be affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than
France.
During the recent controversies over alleged 'job poaching' in relocation to
the UK of production by Hoover from Burgundy and Digital from the west of
Ireland, Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, promised a new effort
to get the works councils directive into EC law.
The Commission believes such cases would be less inflammatory with
obligatory consultation of the workforce, denying companies the chance to
play one set of employees off against another.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK employment secretary, yesterday expressed
'fundamental reservations', objecting because the measure was prescriptive,
mandatory and based on a single model which did not include, for instance,
employee share options.

FT  07 APR 93 / Severn bridge supplier named in Italian corruption inquiry:
Sir Teddy Taylor calls on Heseltine to investigate company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of an Italian civil engineering company which last year
controversially won the contract to supply steelwork for a Pounds 300m
bridge over the river Severn in Britain has been placed under house arrest
in Italy following allegations of corruption.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East, who strongly criticised
the award of the contract to Cimolai, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade secretary, requesting an official investigation into
the Italian company.
He said: 'This raises serious issues which must be investigated, given the
previous concern over the award of an important contract to a non-British
company.'
The allegations against Mr Luigi Cimolai, managing director of Cimolai,
involve two projects in north-east Italy - the proposed construction of the
Plandipan-Sequals highway and the completed Delizia bridge across the River
Tagliamento, close to the company's headquarters in Pordenone.
Some of the biggest corruption scandals in Italy have involved construction
and engineering companies, which were awarded lucrative domestic contracts
for public works projects in exchange for making illicit payments to
political parties.
The arrest is embarrassing for John Laing of the UK and GTM Entrepose of
France which are jointly building the privately financed Severn crossing and
which awarded the Pounds 7m steelwork contract to Cimolai in November.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of the British construction group, said: 'Our
contract is with a company, not with an individual. We were required under
EC rules to advertise the job internationally.
'We would have preferred to give the work to a British company but Cimolai
offered by far the best terms and has an excellent record for this kind of
work. The company's offer and record were checked thoroughly.'
Sir Teddy Taylor, however, remains critical of the deal. He said: 'I am
concerned that companies from the continent can use EC competition rules to
win work in Britain with the benefit of subsidised prices, while British
companies find it impossible to make headway in countries like Italy.'
The British Constructional Steelwork Association says Italian steelwork
companies seeking to gain a foothold in the market have been undercutting
prices submitted by local suppliers by up to 20 per cent.
Cimolai was recently reported to have won a steelwork contract for the Pont
de Normandie viaduct on the A29 motorway near Le Havre in northern France.

FT  07 APR 93 / N Ireland Electricity flotation planned for June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity in June amid
City expectations that it will seek to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds
400m in the flotation.
Following this sale of the last non-nuclear power company in the public
sector, the next step in the government's privatisation programme is
expected to be the disposal of its remaining shares in British Telecom.
Yesterday's NIE announcement reinforced City speculation that the BT sale
will be in late July.
The government yesterday launched the privatisation of NIE, the first
flotation to be targeted specifically at the Northern Ireland public, with a
series of television advertisements featuring Finn McCool, a legendary Irish
giant.
The offer for sale will be in early June, with share trading expected to
start in the week beginning June 21.
Potential investors will have to wait until mid-May before the company
publishes its pathfinder prospectus, including accounts for the year just
ended and profit forecasts. The share price will be announced in early June.
Mr Simon Linnett, a director of N. M. Rothschild, advising the government,
said he could not yet say how much the government would realise, but he
expected the order of magnitude to be 'about the same' as the Pounds 350m
realised last year through the sale of the four Northern Ireland generating
plants.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that one of
the government's objectives was to widen and deepen share ownership in
Northern Ireland. At least half of the shares will be available to small
investors who, like institutional investors, will be asked to pay for the
shares in instalments over about a year.
UK institutions will be given presentations in April and May. The initial
allocation to them will be reduced if there is substantial demand from small
shareholders.
NIE customers will be eligible for incentives including bonus shares and
bill-discounts if they register with the NIE share information office.
Non-customers who register will be eligible for bonus shares, although on
less favourable terms.
Investors will also be encouraged by Finn McCool who, according to Irish
folklore, bestrode the Giant's Causeway around 250BC. In one of two
television commercials, McCool is shown emerging amid lightning and crashing
boulders from a cliff-face.
Investors in the rest of the UK will have to be content with newspaper
advertisement images of McCool, as television advertisements are not being
shown outside Northern Ireland.

FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Isosceles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Isosceles's proposed financial restructuring represents the best outcome the
company can expect in its dire predicament. Almost certainly, though, it
will not be enough to save its owners further blushes.
The plan assumes the ring-fenced Gateway grocery chain will be left
supporting Pounds 464m of debt on operating profits of perhaps Pounds 70m
this year. Out of that, Gateway must pay interest of some Pounds 45m and may
have to pay dividends to Isosceles. That will leave little scope to upgrade
its outdated store portfolio, despite an additional Pounds 80m of working
capital facilities. Gateway will concentrate on reinvigorating its 500 core
stores. But it will be tough work simply staunching its sales decline, which
has been running at an 8 per cent annual rate.
The remainder of Isosceles's Pounds 1.4bn of debt will be carried in
restructured form by the parent company. Holders of the Pounds 256m of
senior debt and Pounds 400m of discount bonds will still hope for some
salvage from a flotation or sale of Gateway. Barring a transformation in
Gateway's trading, owners of the preference and ordinary shares will get no
return at all. Isosceles's 38 banks seem disposed to swallow their losses
with surprising equanimity. Maybe they have simply grown blase at writing
down problem loans. But the alternatives are scarcely tempting. Either they
inject yet more capital and risk going for growth or they put Isosceles into
receivership and try to squeeze value from Gateway's notional Pounds 800m of
assets.

FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco's results betray the forced cheer one would expect from a retailer
that is selling French champagne at less than Pounds 8 a bottle. Operating
profits were up 17 per cent on a 52-week comparison basis, but the company
admits the recession is not over. Its customers are still trading down and
volume in existing stores fell by 0.9 per cent last year. Weekly revenue per
square foot in newly-opened stores is approaching Pounds 14.50. Though a
marked improvement on a year ago, that is still significantly below J.
Sainsbury and the company is vague about the extent of follow-through
increases on stores opened in 1991.
This is not to belittle the 0.5 point increase to 7.6 per cent in Tesco's
operating margin. Since Sainsbury's margin is about a point higher, there
ought to be room for more productivity gains, although Tesco will always be
dragged down to some degree by the relatively large share of petrol in its
total sales. The real difference between the two is that Sainsbury has been
able to increase both volume and margin during the recession.
Tesco's fortunes depend on how quickly it can build volume. According to the
charitable view, its clientele suffered more than Sainsbury's during the
recession, so Tesco should be rated a recovery stock. That ignores the
arrival of the discounters and the renaissance of Asda. The risk remains
that Tesco will have neither the brand image nor the price competitiveness
to compete in a mature market. Until it can prove otherwise, its shares will
not look cheap, even on a prospective multiple some four points below the
market.

FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Scrip dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion for enhanced scrip dividends risks getting out of hand. The tax
efficient nature of the scheme - especially for companies writing off
unrelieved advance corporation tax - does not disguise what is in effect a
mini-rights issue. The market should thus apply the same tests as to a
conventional cash call. Companies which can make a convincing case for
re-investing the dividend are worthy of support. All credit to Coats Viyella
for yesterday pin-pointing specific investments on which it looks likely to
achieve a decent rate of return. By asking shareholders to forego a cash
dividend to shore up its balance sheet, Ladbroke is stretching the point.
Altering dividend arrangements after shares have gone ex-dividend equally
sets a poor precedent. Both Ladbroke and RTZ transgressed in this respect.
Investors buying either share after the ex-dividend date, only to find the
dividend subsequently increased, might justifiably feel aggrieved. True, the
companies benefit from lower tax and interest charges. They may also have
been reluctant to announce tax-driven arrangements before the Budget. Such
pragmatic arguments are no excuse for the risk of creating a false market.
If shareholders approve, Coats may issue shares in place of its next interim
dividend. It should be wary of coming back next year as well, even if the
reinvestment case is strong. Finding cash for the dividend is a valuable
discipline. Companies which print shares rather than meet such obligations
are no more deserving of support than governments which monetise deficits.

FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Relapse at Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons can hardly be blamed for the failure of tipredane to make the
clinical grade. The high rate of attrition among drugs during even the late
stages of development is what makes pharmaceuticals a risk business. Even
so, the shortcomings of tipredane might have been recognised earlier. The
secret of success lies in weeding out ineffective compounds before serious
money has been spent on development. As late as last month, the company was
predicting the commercial launch of this product by 1997. More seriously,
the failure raises the question of whether Fisons is big enough to compete
in the long term.
With no obvious successor to Tilade in the research pipeline, Fisons'
franchise in asthma therapy could wither. Tilade is protected by patents
until the end of the decade, but competition from the likes of ICI and the
long lead-time required to develop new drugs dictate that it must move fast
to plug the gap. Scrapping tipredane saves Pounds 10m a year which can be
devoted to other compounds. Licensing drugs from other companies might
provide a solution. Without one, Fisons' experience in asthma therapy would
be worth more in other hands.
If that makes a takeover more likely, yesterday's 13 per cent fall in the
shares may be overdone. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that Fisons
is worth less without the promise of tipredane. With such a long record of
nasty surprises to be taken into account, potential predators will prefer to
sit back and wait.

MANY large British companies operating on the continent may be forced to set
up elected works councils under European Community proposals which Denmark
is seeking to push through into law.
The EC directive would require the councils to be set up by any company  -
including those based outside the EC - that has more than 1,000 employees in
more than one of the EC's 12 member states (with more than 100 employees in
at least two of the states). They would have to be consulted on issues such
as job changes, new technology and investment and relocation plans.
Denmark, current holder of the EC presidency, is determined to go ahead with
the directive, one of the Community's most controversial pieces of
legislation.
After talks among employment and social affairs ministers yesterday in
Luxembourg, it became clear that Britain - the only member state opposing
the measure - will have to fight to dilute its content, or see it passed by
its 11 partners, assuming that the Maastricht treaty and its social protocol
come into force later this year.
If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies
would still be among those most affected. According to British calculations,
more than 100 UK companies have operations in continental Europe which are
large enough to fall under the requirements of the directive for their
operations outside Britain.
If the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 companies would be
affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than France.
Denmark wants agreement among the 11 by the EC's June summit, to crown its
presidency. If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did

FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: Labour and industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRIKING feature of Labour's latest attempt to develop an industrial
policy is not that it looks like yet another retreat into the nostrums of
the 1960s. Rather, it is that the emphasis on manufacturing is no longer an
exclusive Labour preoccupation. Much in this new draft could have been
written without a blush by members of John Major's government. More could
have been written by leading luminaries in the administration of Mr Bill
Clinton. But the mere fact that the spirit of the times seems to have moved
closer to Labour rather than vice versa is something less than an
overwhelming commendation for a mixed bag of policy proposals.
The convergence of political interest in manufacturing is, of course, no
coincidence. With the country running a huge trade deficit in the depths of
recession, the case for shifting resources into manufacturing is easily
made. But to jump from there into the technological nationalism espoused by
some of Mr Clinton's economic advisers is more contentious.
The evidence, such as it is, suggests that success in high-technology
industries is a result of general economic success, not the other way
around. While the Japanese have demonstrated increasing technological
sophistication in generating their economic miracle, their high-growth rates
have had more to do with good macro-economic management and a culture that
values such things as saving, education and harmonious labour relations,
than with any obsession with technology.
Labour is nonetheless clearly tempted by a reform of corporate governance
that would take Britain closer to systems such as the Japanese or German,
which recognise government, employees, creditors and others as having a
stake in the business. But most of British management remains antipathetic.
Legislating for employees in the boardroom is thus not practical politics.
And while Labour has interesting ideas on such things as the structure of
the financial system, investment incentives and the operations of the
bankruptcy laws, it is not clear that these and other components of
industrial policy are central to addressing Britain's competitiveness
problem.
The country's structural trade deficit is very largely a reflection of
inadequate investment in the production of tradeable goods and services,
itself largely explained by stop-go policies and consistently low
profitability. What is needed is to constrain the growth of real wages and
stimulate higher savings and investment.
It is questionable, however, whether Labour, any more than the Tories, would
be willing to forgo the customary pre-electoral boost to wages and reduction
in private savings that deliver votes, but at the cost of swelling the trade
deficit and restarting the stop-go cycle. It is here, not in technological
mercantilism, that the miracle economies of the east have the most valuable
lessons to impart.

Has Paul Keating set off a process he can't control?
The Labor government's unexpected election victory three weeks ago has
prompted a rash of support for the Australian prime minister's republican
views. Polls suggest that they are now shared by up to 70 per cent of
voters.
But Western Australian Liberal MPs Ross Lightfoot and Phillip Pendal see the
proposed constitutional change as an opportunity to revive the old west
coast dream of separation from the eastern states - where most Australians
live.
In a neat reversal of the situation in Germany where Wessies resent the
dependence of the newly liberated Ossies, many western Australians are
unhappy about what they see as the malign influence of Canberra.
Pendal, who opposes a republic, says he would prefer a stronger hand for the
western states. But if the government refuses that, which is highly likely,
he sees secession as a viable second choice.
The idea is not as crazy as it sounds. WA covers about a third of the
continent, and its mining industry provides a large part of Australia's
export earnings.
The state actually tried to secede in 1933, but gave up after strong
opposition from both Canberra and Britain, which then had residual rights to
legislate for its former Australian colonies.

Jacques Attali - president of the London-based European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development - is a man accustomed to getting his own way.
He will be pleased therefore at the EBRD board's recent support - lukewarm
though it was - for his wish that the bank's 1994 annual meeting be held in
St Petersburg rather than Sofia.
The Bulgarians had formally asked to host the meeting, but Attali is, for
some reason, more enthusiastic about St Petersburg. The 23-member board has
the final say-so, and it has voted to accept St Petersburg; but it is
understood that the vote proved to be less than a ringing endorsement. Two
members - the US and, understandably, Bulgaria, voted against; 11 abstained,
and 10 voted in favour.
So St Petersburg it is.
Meanwhile, the Bulgarians have been asked to invite the EBRD to Sofia in
1996 (every other year the meeting is held in London), by which time
Attali's first term as president will be over.
Of course, he may always try to extend his presidency. But the Bulgarians
may have something to say about that.

Exciting times at The Economist, the weekly magazine part-owned by the
Financial Times, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year. Having
just appointed another astonishingly young editor, Japanophile Bill Emmott,
it has now gone and imported an ex-Savannah shrimp-boater as chief
executive.
Marjorie Scardino, the 46-year-old president of The Economist's important
North American business, is a little shy about her time on the boats. It was
just an interlude before she and her journalist husband, Albert Scardino,
settled down to their first love - the newspaper business. Scardino worked
by day as a lawyer in her husband's home town of Savannah while helping him
produce his weekly Georgia Gazette by night.
The paper made a name for itself by winning a Pulitzer prize for its
investigative reporting - but partly because of this was not a great
commercial success. After her husband moved to The New York Times, she
joined The Economist where, by all accounts, she has flourished. During her
seven years, North American circulation has nearly trebled to 230,000 and
several new publishing ventures have either been set up or acquired.
The secret of The Economist's great success in North America has been much
debated, but Scardino tells me that running the business is not much
different from running a weekly local newspaper. How refreshingly honest.

Why recruit legendary warrior Finn McCool - also known as Fingal of the
eponymous Cave and of the Giant's Causeway - to spearhead the UK
government's attempt to pull in Pounds 350m by selling shares in Northern
Ireland Electricity? Students of things Celtic, at least, will have a field
day with the topic.
Not the least controversial question is whether he was even a Celt. One
translation of his name is 'fair stranger' - which, it is suggested, is what
the Irish might have called a visitor from Scandinavia.
Even so, he is credited with having one idea ahead of its time. Legend says
the spectacular rock formations on the Antrim coast are the remains of
Fingal's attempt to build a road to Scotland. Now NIE is proposing to bridge
the same gap with an electricity interconnector.

FT  07 APR 93 / Personal View: Rewrite the rules for regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIETER HELM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Damaging disputes are raging in most of Britain's privatised utilities. The
water companies and their regulators are arguing about the cost of
environmental standards. The row between British Gas and Ofgas has not been
quietened by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. The electricity
industry, its regulator and the government have reached a truce following
their dispute over coal contracts.
These battles illustrate an increasingly obvious point: the regulatory
framework is in crisis and in urgent need of reform.
In the British administrative tradition, the rules of the game (laid down in
licences and legislation) are poorly defined. Director-generals are
appointed with wide discretionary powers to ensure the utilities act in the
public interest. General duties, such as 'promoting competition', allow
regulators to interfere in virtually any aspect of the utility's business.
Also, since terms such as 'competition' can be interpreted in a variety of
ways, a regulator can choose which competition model he wishes to employ.
The result is inevitable: unaccountable to anyone, regulators pursue their
own agenda, leaving regulated companies, shareholders and customers to play
a costly guessing game.
Regulators not only have discretion over the interpretation of the rules;
they can also change them. Almost all regulators have implicitly rejected
many of the original terms of privatisations and have chiselled away at the
structures of their industries.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has presided over a
'dash for gas' at a time of excess capacity, allowing the regional
electricity companies to integrate vertically through long-term contracts.
His counterpart in the water industry, Ian Byatt, rejects much of the
rationale behind new environmental standards. At Ofgas, Sir James McKinnon
has now decided that the gas industry should be broken up.
The utilities' licences can be changed easily. The regulator proposes
modifications, which the utility can accept or reject.  Rejection, however,
leads to a referral to the MMC, the prospect of which is usually enough to
make a utility accept a regulator's proposals. Core issues such as the
closure of power stations and the accounting structure of BT are being dealt
with in this way.
This exploitation of discretion has meant that, contrary to its designers'
intentions, UK regulation has turned out to be heavy-handed. While some
discretion is desirable, a distinction should be drawn between the
interpretation of licences and changes to them. The latter are fundamental.
They touch on wider public interests, and should be debated publicly.
The power of regulators to 'negotiate' amendments to licences without public
debate should be curtailed. The licences were defined by government and
sanctioned through legislation. These licences set the 'regulatory contract'
between privatised companies and their customers. It is not appropriate to
permit largely unaccountable regulators to alter their terms, behind closed
doors. An automatic reference to the MMC, with a public consultation period,
is a minimal requirement.
However, reform should go further than this. A consistent set of principles
for the conduct of regulation is required. In particular, these should
define a common approach to setting prices. At present, each regulator
chooses his own preferred method. However, it is time for a common
methodology. This could be provided by a white paper on utility regulation,
to complement the 1978 white paper, which still provides the framework for
regulating nationalised industries.
The institutional structure of regulation also needs to be reconsidered. The
current system of a host of ad hoc semi-autonomous offices of regulation
leads to inconsistency. An Office of Regulation should be set up, reporting
to the Department of Trade and Industry. Given the present position,
however, some mergers of regulators would be helpful. Offer, the electricity
regulator, and Ofgas could be merged to create an Office of Energy
Regulation. Likewise an Office of Transport Regulation and an Office of
Communications could be set up.
Measures such as a white paper on regulatory principles, a limitation on
regulators' powers to modify licences without public debate, and
institutional reform are essential to create a more predictable and stable
climate for investment, while at the same time protecting the public from
monopoly pricing. Failure to tackle the problem will continue to raise the
price of investment, weaken the quality of the regulatory structure and
ultimately undermine consumers' interests.

FT  07 APR 93 / Road map to the Rover's return: Co-operation with Honda and
upmarket models are the route to profits for the UK car maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda and Rover may have stopped short of marriage - for the time being at
least - but they are happily cohabiting in the strongest relationship yet
formed between a Japanese and European carmaker.
Their latest jointly developed vehicles, the new generation Honda Accord and
the Rover 600, are being readied for launch. The large family saloons, which
look different but have the same engines and gearboxes and mostly shared
components, are set to become crucial milestones in the development of both
companies' fortunes in Europe.
For Rover, the relationship is particularly vital. The 600 series, unveiled
today, is the latest in the line of new vehicles launched since 1989 aimed
at transforming Rover from its British Leyland past as a failed maker of
poor quality volume cars into its hoped-for future as a producer of premium
upmarket models capable of competing with the likes of BMW and Audi.
The process, dubbed 'Roverisation', is key to its strategy for survival in
Europe as a medium-sized producer of around 500,000 vehicles a year
(including Land Rover) which is competitive with the world's largest
manufacturers.
Rover, which was sold by the government to British Aerospace in 1988, has
weathered the worst of the UK recession. It has contained its losses in the
past two years while pressing ahead with its new model programme. By the end
of 1992 about 90 per cent of its sales were of models launched in the
preceding three years.
In August, five years after the takeover, BAe will be freed of government
constraints on disposing of the Rover operations. Mr John Cahill, BAe
chairman, says the date is 'increasingly a red herring'. As speculation
rises over a possible Rover sale, he insists, 'we have no plans to sell
Rover. Rover remains part of our core business strategy.'
The assertion is only credible in the context of the link with Honda, which
holds a 20 per cent stake in the Rover vehicle operations, and has shown
little inclination to raise the holding.
'If BAe wished to sell Rover Group in the future, then we would have to
review the situation,' says a Honda spokesman. 'It would be difficult to
continue the sharing of technology and designs if it was sold to another
manufacturer.'
For Rover the relationship with Honda, now in its 14th year, has spelled
survival. Rover's existing 200/400 small family car and 800 executive ranges
were the result of collaborative projects with Honda. The two companies are
currently at an advanced stage in negotiating their next important
co-operative venture, the development of a new small car that would replace
Rover's Metro in the mid-1990s.
With the launch of the 600, Rover is dependent on Honda technology for three
of its four main car ranges, and it is doubtful whether it has the resources
to develop an all-new mainstream car programme on its own. According to Mr
John Towers, Rover Group managing director, the UK company accounted for
about 15 per cent of the engineering hours in the series 600 project, in
which it has invested around Pounds 200m. He claims the joint programme has
saved Rover about Pounds 150m in development costs.
'If we were going alone we would have had higher variable costs. We would
have had to push up volumes, which would have meant higher marketing costs.
Everybody is getting into joint ventures, not because it's fashionable but
because it makes economic sense.'
Crucially, however, the Honda link has left Rover with the independence to
pursue its own strategies based on Honda chassis platforms. In particular,
the Rover 200/400 - the sister car of the Honda Concerto - has spawned a
host of derivatives developed exclusively by Rover. These include coupe,
cabriolet and diesel models.
The benefits of the relationship with Honda go beyond technology and
resources. 'We have acquired an insight into Japanese best practice and
processes,' says Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover and deputy chief
executive of BAe. 'The Honda relationship has been invaluable as a learning
opportunity.'
Mr Simpson claims that the 'learning process' has given Rover big
opportunities to reduce costs in every aspect of its business, from moving
to just-in-time production, to lean distribution, to the creation of a
flexible workforce.
Rover's 'new deal' package of labour reforms, achieved in the past two years
without confrontation, is aimed at allowing it to compete with the UK plants
of Nissan, Honda and Toyota.
'With a single-status employee base represented by a single negotiating
body, we have together achieved mutual benefits. We have full flexibility,
genuine team working, and employees who are comprehensively involved in
process improvement and waste elimination,' says Mr Simpson.
Despite such improvements, the severity of the UK recession has taken its
toll on the car company. The Rover vehicle operations have fallen into
deficit in the past two years with an operating loss of Pounds 49m in 1992
compared with a loss of Pounds 52m in 1991 and an operating profit of Pounds
65m in 1990.
But BAe expects Rover to move back into profit this year. It believes
recovery will be based on:
stronger new car demand with UK new car sales forecast to rise to 1.65m from
1.59m in 1992;
a further reduction in costs following a 7.5 per cent improvement in
productivity in 1992;
the launch this month of the Rover 600 range; and
improved competitiveness gained by depreciation of sterling.
As consumer demand in the UK shows signs of revival, Rover is pushing ahead
with its ambitious cost-cutting plan. In the first quarter of this year the
workforce was reduced, through voluntary redundancies, by about 2,000 to
just over 31,000. This compares with 35,000 at the end of 1991 and 40,500 at
the end of 1990.
At the same time, productivity gains have reduced Rover's break-even point
to an annual production of around 440,000 vehicles last year. The target is
to reach a break-even level of 400,000.
Improved productivity is partly a result of investment in new plant and
equipment. Rover's assembly plant at Cowley, Oxford, has been transformed
from one of the UK motor industry's oldest manufacturing complexes into a
compact plant for the production of Rover's large cars, the 800 series
executive car and now the 600 series.
Rover has invested around Pounds 215m in the new Cowley facility, which has
a capacity to produce 110,000 cars a year including more than 50,000 of the
600 series cars.
Mr Towers claims that Cowley is now 'an advanced and flexible production
plant within existing buildings - but with many of the advantages of a
greenfield site'.
Rover's ambition to return to profit this year does, however, face
obstacles. In particular, a sharp fall in new car demand in continental
Europe threatens to offset the benefits of increased competitiveness
resulting from the depreciation of sterling after Britain's withdrawal from
the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
Despite the weakness of the continental market, Rover executives are
determined to increase their presence there. Dependence on the UK market,
which accounts for around 57 per cent of its vehicle sales, is Rover's
Achilles' heel, say industry observers.
In an attempt to bolster its presence in continental Europe, it has expanded
its dealer network in Germany from 120 to 150 last year. It is aiming to add
another 100 by 1995.
The company hopes that the Rover 600 will help it to build a bridgehead to
the Continent, and more than half of production is earmarked for export.
In continental Europe, as elsewhere, the 600 is being pitched against the
BMW 3-series, the Audi 80 and the Mercedes-Benz 190, as Rover seeks to set
itself apart from the dogfight among the volume car makers such as VW, Fiat,
Ford and General Motors (Opel-Vauxhall).
The tired Montego, Rover's old product in the segment for large family cars
and a legacy from BL, may have had to fight a losing battle against the
likes of the Ford Sierra - now replaced by the Mondeo - and the Vauxhall
Cavalier. But with the 600 Rover has set its sights upmarket. Roverisation
is about to face its critical road test.

FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: ITV tangle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM ONE point of view, yesterday's report by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission on Channel 3 networking arrangements is an elegant solution to an
intractable dispute over the operation of Britain's reorganised independent
television system. From a longer-term perspective, however, the exercise
smells unmistakeably of fudge.
The MMC's achievement has been to find a formula for bringing the
contractual arrangements between the newly franchised ITV companies and
independent producers into line with competition law, while managing also to
leave both sides claiming victory. Yet it has done so only by devising an
elaborate and provisional compromise. The MMC itself is unsure how well it
will work, arguing that it would be unwise to impose rigid prescriptions on
an untried broadcasting regime. Indeed, the MMC explicitly recognises that
the Office of Fair Trading, which will monitor the arrangements, may be
required to intervene again in the future.
In the circumstances, the MMC has probably done about as much as it
reasonably could. Its remit extends simply to the specific competition
issues raised by a somewhat technical dispute over the contractual
arrangements between independent programme makers and broadcasters. However,
that dispute is a reflection of strains caused by deep contradictions and
uncertainties in government policy towards broadcasting.
In drawing up the ITV franchising regime, the Thatcher administration set
two main objectives. One was to create a vigorous independent production
sector. It now appears that insufficient thought was given to creating
market conditions in which independent programme makers could gain network
access while earning returns adequate to attract outside capital.
That shortcoming stems in part from confusion about the second objective -
making the ITV system more commercial by exposing it to market forces. The
new franchise system has undoubtedly put pressure on the ITV companies to
cut costs. However, the policy stopped well short of driving competition to
its logical conclusion.
The ITV companies are supposed to behave like commercial animals. Yet they
inhabit an environment which retains many of the paternalistic features of
the old system. They are subject to necessarily subjective quality
standards. Their ownership structure is hemmed in by restrictions on
cross-ownership and merger, which also inhibit the development of a UK
television industry able to compete internationally.
In the longer term, competition from satellite and cable broadcasters -
which are subject to none of these conditions - is likely to subject the
system to overwhelming pressures for change. In the meantime, its internal
contradictions threaten to produce further strains and conflicts, to which
the intervention of competition authorities can offer, at best, only a
partial solution.

FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE FIELD of economic mismanagement, Nigeria is in a class of its own.
Billions of dollars earned during the 1970s oil boom have been squandered on
white elephants and kickbacks. An economic reform plan, introduced by
President Ibrahim Babangida in 1986, collapsed within three years. Since
then frequent promises to do better have not been kept. In short, calling
for help for Nigeria seems akin to supporting parole for a notorious
recidivist.
Yet the case for supporting economic reform in Nigeria is stronger today
than ever, despite this dismal track record. Burdened by debts and
accelerating inflation, and nearing the end of a flawed transition to
civilian rule which encourages the short-term instincts of the presidential
candidates in June's election, there is a risk that Nigeria will experience
a Kenyan-style swing to economic populism or worse. The oil and gas sector
might still flourish; but export receipts would be siphoned abroad as the
impoverished hinterland deteriorated further.
The west might feel able to look on with equanimity in the short term.
Arrears on the country's Dollars 30bn external debt are mounting; but
capital flow is in the creditors' favour. Their advice to Nigeria is
straightforward: proceed with the June election, but forget the idea of
concessional debt anytime soon.
Yet a longer term perspective demands an urgent search for a fresh approach.
Ten years of deepening austerity have exacted a heavy toll on Nigeria.
Sooner or later, the strains will become intolerable, risking the
destabilisation of the entire west African region in the process. A surge in
Moslem extremism, lying not far below the surface in Nigeria, and a rise in
emigration to southern Europe are two likely consequences. The UN initiative
in Somalia has already cost Dollars 1.5bn; the cost of restoring order in
west Africa would be incalculable.
Creditors must grasp what may be a last opportunity to persuade Nigeria's
leaders that economic reform makes sense. Of course, the creditors cannot
offer debt relief unless they are convinced that the budget deficit is under
control - the principle of an IMF deal as a pre-condition for relief should
remain inviolate. But the IMF should use this month's visit to Nigeria to
draw up a 'shadow' reform programme with the reform-minded transitional
council. The elected government can then inherit this programme at the
August hand-over.
In return the Paris Club creditors should pledge that staged debt relief
will commence as soon as the budget is under control. Conditions should
include external monitoring of the central bank and important ministries to
ensure transparent accounting of incoming revenues and spending.
Only then might the west persuade both the military leadership and the new
civilian president to put prudence before populism. It may not succeed. But
it would be better than simply waiting for Nigeria's disaster to happen.

FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Tecs provide special programmes for women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DIANA MCMAHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joanna Foster's comment (Letters, April 3) is welcome since your
article 'EOC says women overlooked by Tecs' (March 31) did not reflect my
own experience at the local level, or that of other training and enterprise
councils.
In Bedfordshire, in addition to all the normal programmes available for
women, we run six initiatives to tackle the barriers experienced by women
who want to train, start a business or return to employment.
An example is the Tecs' Out of School Clubs programme which is now being
expanded with funds from the secretary of state's Childcare Initiative to
make it easier for parents, particularly women, to have choice of work and
training opportunities.
We are just one Tec; I know of some 12 others providing special
opportunities for women and there are many more reported in local Tec
newsletters.
However, the issue of the severely retracting workforce, the consequence of
recession, is real and has certainly had an adverse effect on women's
prospects. Tecs continue to work with employers and all members of the
workforce - particularly those disadvantaged in the community - to overcome
these difficulties. Since women represent almost half of the workforce they
receive a great deal of attention in Bedfordshire - and throughout the Tec
network.

FT  07 APR 93 / A setback, but the search goes on: Disappointments over AZT
are unlikely to slow research into Aids treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The virus that causes Aids, HIV, is the most intensively studied microbe in
history. Worldwide spending of about Dollars 2bn a year on Aids research has
produced extraordinary knowledge of HIV but no effective treatment for the
infection, as the disappointing outcome of an international trial of the
leading Aids drug AZT showed last week.
However, with 12m people worldwide estimated to be HIV-positive and the
total direct and indirect costs of the disease running at Dollars 90bn a
year, government health agencies and the pharmaceutical industry say there
will be no let-up in their research effort.
The virus is deceptively simple; it has a genetic blueprint of just nine
genes (compared with 100,000 in man) producing 15 proteins. Scientists now
know the precise chemical sequence of all the genes and proteins, yet they
cannot develop a selective drug to jam the vital processes of HIV without
devastating the cells it infects.
Aids researchers face two fundamental problems. First, HIV mutates more
quickly than any other microbe known; there are countless different strains,
and within each patient the virus changes character as the disease
progresses. Therefore drug-resistant forms can evolve very fast.
The second problem is that, although the chemistry of the virus itself is
simple and well understood, scientists are still baffled by the extremely
complex process through which HIV infects human cells and then, several
years later, destroys the immune system.
One particularly puzzling feature of Aids is that patients have very low
levels of the virus in comparison to other infectious diseases. Indeed HIV
may not actually 'infect' most of the cells it kills; it may somehow set off
a cascade of 'cell suicide' similar to an accelerated ageing process.
AZT was rushed through the approvals process and on to the market in 2 1/2
years - a record for any drug - after Wellcome researchers discovered its
activity against the newly discovered HIV in 1984. It can prolong the lives
of patients with full-scale Aids by several months, but clinical trials show
that the benefits wear off with time. As the Anglo-French Concorde study
concluded last week, after three years, people with HIV taking AZT had just
as many Aids symptoms as those on an inactive placebo.
Although AZT is still the mainstream Aids therapy, regulatory authorities
approved two new drugs last year: DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US
and DDC from Roche of Switzerland. All three belong to a group of synthetic
chemicals called nucleoside analogues which work by mimicking natural
building blocks of genetic material. When HIV takes up a drug molecule, it
stops replicating.
The theory behind nucleoside analogues may sound convincing but in practice
they are 'relatively ineffective drugs', says Dr Joep Lange, head of
clinical research for the World Health Organisation's global Aids programme.
They produce only a 10-fold suppression of viral activity, whereas an
antibiotic will suppress bacteria by a factor of many million.
'On a scientific level, I think AZT and all the simple nucleoside analogues
have been massively oversold,' says Dr Alan Kingsman of Oxford University.
He points out that a modest suppression of HIV might have no clinical
benefit if the virus is not killing cells directly but triggering a process
of cell suicide.
Over the past year, Aids specialists have come to agree that no nucleoside
analogue on its own will treat HIV effectively in the long term.
'Combination therapies are likely to become the mainstay,' says Dr Trevor
Jones, research director of Wellcome. AZT is likely to be part of most
'cocktails' developed in the near future.
Clinical tests have already demonstrated two advantages of pharmaceutical
combinations: first, the ingredients may have a synergistic effect on each
other; and second, it is far more difficult for HIV to mutate in a way that
develops resistance to several drugs at once. Their disadvantage will be
financial. A course of AZT at the minimum recommended dose already costs
Pounds 1,900 a year and the price of a combination with other patented drugs
may be prohibitive.
Although nucleoside analogues are in the forefront of HIV drug development -
and two more, Glaxo's 3TC and Bristol-Myers Squibb's D4T, are beginning
large-scale clinical trials - different approaches may be more promising in
the long run.
Therapeutic vaccines are an example. They are designed not to prevent
infection like a conventional vaccine but to boost the immune defences of
people who are already HIV-positive. British Biotechnology recently started
clinical trials of one such product called p24-VLP; this includes multiple
copies of an HIV core protein, packaged in a virus-like particle made by
genetically engineered yeast cells.
Genetic attacks on HIV are a somewhat more distant prospect. But some US
biotechnology companies are planning to put anti-viral genes into the blood
cells of Aids patients, and others want to use so-called anti-sense
technology to de-activate the virus by blocking its genes.
Doctors such as Professor Anthony Pinching of St Bartholomew's Hospital,
London, say they are impressed by the way the pharmaceutical industry
continues to pour several hundred million dollars a year into Aids research
and development, even though patient activists have directed a long campaign
against Wellcome, the only manufacturer to have made money out of an
anti-HIV drug, for allegedly profiteering at their expense.
Indeed Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, says his company is
devoting more resources to Aids R&amp;D than the likely return from successful
products would justify according to normal commercial criteria. 'I don't see
any cut-throat competition in drug development in the Aids area,' he says.
'No one is going to make much money from this but we need to show that the
pharmaceutical industry can produce the goods when it needs to.'
The scientific credibility of any large drug company would be at stake if it
pulled out of such an important field. The argument that Aids is a special
case may not appeal to someone dying of another incurable illness, but it
may be reasonable to devote a disproportionate share of pharmaceutical R&amp;D
funds to Aids because it poses an incalculable threat for the future which
makes it genuinely different from the established killer diseases.
'The virus is relatively innocuous at the moment because it does not
transmit very easily,' Dr Kingsman says. 'But what if it became more robust
and was transmitted like 'flu?' The risk of that nightmare scenario coming
true may be remote but with such a fast-mutating organism as HIV it cannot
be dismissed entirely.
Assuming that HIV does not change significantly in the near future - and is
spread only by sexual contact, blood or maternal transmission - forecasts of
the number of people infected in the year 2000 vary from the World Health
Organisation's conservative 30m-40m up to 120m.
The latest WHO estimates of the number of new infections each year (see
chart) show peaks in the mid-1980s in Europe and North America and in the
early 1990s in Africa and Latin America - though the long delay between
infection and disease means that actual Aids cases will continue rising in
these regions into the next century. The most frightening picture is for
Asia, where the the number of new HIV-positives is expected to go on
increasing until about 2010.
The total worldwide cost of Aids is probably running at about Dollars 10bn a
year for direct treatment, prevention and research and Dollars 80bn
indirectly from loss of earnings.
Figures such as those are helping to persuade governments to increase
spending on Aids research - and to ignore the small group insisting that the
threat from the disease has been grossly exaggerated by a medical
establishment eager to nurture a worldwide 'Aids industry'. The Clinton
administration is leading the way with plans to set up a strengthened Office
of Aids Research with a Dollars 1bn annual budget.
If that level of commitment is maintained, researchers should eventually
translate the scientific understanding of HIV into treatments that work far
better than AZT.

FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Failure to deliver what Russians most require (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I recently started a company in London with a representative office in
Moscow. My Russian contacts are desperate to buy all kinds of fast-moving
consumer goods for immediate export to the Commonwealth of Independent
States. I have been contacting many blue chip companies, in the UK and
overseas, in order to obtain quotes for their products.
I have evidently mistakingly assumed that during a time of recession in many
part of the world, companies would be bending over backwards to sell their
goods to whichever country wanted them. This apparently is not so. A small
proportion of the companies I contacted took more than a week to respond,
despite my requests for a prompt reply; most did not even bother to respond
at all.
What does one have to do to increase this country's export potential, or at
least boost the order books of businesses which claim to be suffering from
recession?

<TEXT>
Sir, Once again a big new effort is to be made to give aid to Russia. The
problem surely is that it is not promises of aid which have been wanting. It
is the delivery which is at fault.
According to the European Community's court of auditors, the Community, for
example, voted aid of Ecu835m (Pounds 689m) for 1991; a further Ecu1.75bn
(Pounds 1.44bn) was voted in loans and guarantees. Yet by December 31 1992,
none of this money had been paid out.
According to a senior official in the EC unit dealing with Russian aid, the
unit prefers to work with non-profit-making bodies such as academic
institutions and charities. This is fine for developing capitalist theories
of government, but it is scarcely going to produce the working free-market
economy which the west wants and the Russian government needs.
I am a non-executive director of a company which has had a technical
assistance agreement with a former Russian ministry for 18 months. We have
been told that our Russian partners are not entitled to aid from the EC with
which to purchase this technical assistance because their sphere of activity
'does not fit' the categories chosen by the EC for aid, despite the fact
that one of the categories is human resources training.
The Russians are attempting to find work outside Russia with which to earn
much-needed foreign currency. The ministry has (or had) a highly-skilled
workforce of 800,000. Is this really the best the Community can do?

FT  07 APR 93 / Truly, widely, deeply: A more federal Europe could lead to
greater individual freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Formal negotiations on Norway's application for membership of the European
Community began in Luxembourg on Monday.
Actually that is not quite right. Norway, along with the other three
applicants from the European Free Trade Association (Austria, Finland,
Sweden), was told that it must accept the Maastricht treaty. That means that
they are negotiating to join, not just the EC, but the future European Union
(EU).
That assumes, of course, that Denmark and the UK will actually ratify
Maastricht. If either of them fails to, the treaty is null and void and the
EU non-existent. There would then be a period of confusion, from which would
emerge - probably quite quickly - two parallel efforts to replace Maastricht
with something else.
One would be made by an inner group or 'hard core' of countries determined
to salvage the essential features of Maastricht and apply them among
themselves even if some EC members do not participate - following the model
of the Schengen treaty on removal of internal borders, to which all EC
members except Britain, Ireland and Denmark are now signatories.
The other would be a more modest attempt by all Community members to salvage
a mini-Maastricht, consisting of only those elements which could be
generally accepted as both valuable in themselves and non-threatening to
state sovereignty.
Negotiations with the applicant countries would in any case proceed, since
they would still want EC membership. Obviously Maastricht could no longer be
presented to them as part of the acquis that they are required to accept as
a precondition. Nor could membership of the 'hard core'. In theory, it would
be possible for the 12 to negotiate the mini-Maastricht among themselves and
then introduce it as an acquis into the negotiations with the applicants.
But it would make a lot more sense to include the applicants in the
discussion from the start.
Similar considerations apply if Maastricht is ratified and the EU does come
into existence, presumably by the end of this year. If negotiations with the
applicants go smoothly their accession to the EU should be ratified next
year, in which case they would be full members in time to join the
Maastricht revision conference scheduled for 1996. But even if that
timetable slips, it would be stupid for the existing members to negotiate
revisions to the treaty in the absence of the new members, to whom those
revisions would have to apply - especially as one of the main reasons for
revising the treaty will be the need to adapt it to an EU of 16 members.
British ministers and officials view the revision process with considerable
apprehension. They dread being asked to administer new doses of 'federalism'
to a British body politic which is clearly allergic to them, especially if
(as is likely) the conference coincides with the next general election
campaign. I have argued, and still believe, that one way to avoid a
repetition of the Maastricht nightmare is to entrust the revision to an
elected constituent assembly, instead of another intergovernmental
conference.
It is equally important to think more clearly about what sort of
constitution Europe actually needs. British officials warn that 'Maastricht
is the maximum that is conceptually possible', and that 'widening must not
be made the excuse for further deepening'.
But the word 'deepening' can mean two very different things. If it means
giving the EC, or the EU, new areas of competence, then indeed it should be
resisted. If anything a union with more members should confine itself to
fewer areas of competence - those in which a genuine common interest can be
discerned and in which one member state by itself may not be able to take
effective action.
But if 'deepening' means giving more power to the union's central organs so
that it can act decisively and effectively in areas where joint action is
agreed to be necessary, then indeed a wider union does need also to be a
deeper one. Otherwise it will be paralysed by the endless search for
consensus among 16 governments.
Similarly the word 'federalism' needs to be demystified. Many people in
Britain seem to assume that a federal European authority would diminish
their freedom, acting in an arbitrary and undemocratic way. But actually
that is much truer of intergovernmental procedures, when national ministers
meet to take decisions behind closed doors, with the accountability of each
to his national parliament being diluted both by secrecy and by the need to
agree with (or be outvoted by) his colleagues from other countries.
By contrast, federalism makes the central executive accountable to a federal
parliament; and by distributing power among different levels of government
it makes its arbitrary use much more difficult.
By appealing to a federal constitution, states can resist central
encroachment on their powers; but individuals or local authorities can also
appeal at the federal level against arbitrary action by the states; and a
federal supreme court is there to decide who has the constitution on their
side in each case.
All this also makes for greater transparency, as each level of government
has to publish and defend its decisions, instead of everything being sorted
out within a hierarchy of officials answerable only to those above them.
It is high time someone explained to the British people that a 'deeper',
more federal Europe could actually meddle in fewer aspects of their everyday
lives than the present model, and yet secure a net increase in their
individual freedom.

FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Don't shoot the economic modellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY BRAY MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Treasury economic model may be run by US group', April 6)
that 'a key element' of preparing the Treasury's forecast could be
contracted out to DRI, the American economic forecasting company, does not
specify what that element might be. The implication, however, is that the
element in question is the maintenance of the Treasury model.
Under the Industry Act 1975, the Treasury is required to 'keep an economic
model'. This is not a 'secretive process', as you say; under the
requirements of the act, the model is publicly available. It is used by
outside forecasters, and is independently tested and compared with the other
main economic models by the Warwick University Macroeconomic Modelling
Bureau.
Furthermore, the model clearly pointed to the need for continuing increases
in interest rates, as well as tax increases, following the stock exchange
crash in 1987, instead of the folly which has cost us so dear.
Despite ill-informed press criticism, economic modelling practices in the UK
are in most respects technically well ahead of those in the US. The
econometric modelling methods developed by Professor David Hendry of
Nuffield College, Oxford, are used by the Federal Reserve Board, which
within the US is more advanced than DRI.
The chancellor of the exchequer wrote to me on March 3 saying that 'there
are no plans for the Treasury to give up economic forecasting'. Although
using models built by others is better than nothing, it is no substitute for
an organisation maintaining its own model. Without that there is no way of
judging the weight of evidence behind the particular assumptions made.
For example, currently the Treasury model is doggedly sticking to its
finding that there has been no improvement in the underlying trend of
Britain's exports of manufactures, although the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research found a reversal of trend, which it has now
rationalised by a shift in the composition of export markets towards faster
growing sectors.
The chancellor can ignore the evidence of his own career officials, but he
would be silly to shoot the modellers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's article (Management, April 2), alluded to
organisational re-engineering as a 'cure-all' for business performance. That
is patently not within the realities of executive life.
The consultancy sales pressure on the re-engineering/ design topic is real,
but the sales pitch and follow-up proposal are often the best bits. Delivery
of measurable business benefits is often illusory.
The nut to be cracked is not comprehending the latest consultancy fashion;
it is establishing the right measures in business so as to produce
bottom-line improvements. One measure is to cut jobs; but this is often a
reaction to problems with the most important measure of all - income
generation. Consulting firms take that aspect very seriously in their own
businesses.

FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: New Morning - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Go to a play, see people in worse situations than you are, watch them talk
out their problems, leave the theatre with hope. Then go home, chat to
friends who are in some ways more comfortably situated than you are, listen
to their crises and despondencies, go to bed feeling disconsolate. I am
amazed at the number of serious new plays that end on some bright or
tentatively optimistic note.
Declan Hughes's New Morning, the latest new play at the Bush, is a case in
point. Two sisters spend the weekend together, camping in the open. They
rake over their relationship with each other, with their dead parents, with
life in general. They are sometimes at loggerheads, and one sister, Mary,
fails to respond fully to all the gunge from her subconscious that the night
dredges up. But they get from A to at least B, maybe further, and the play
ends with them helping each other to pull down the tent that they never
slept in anyway. (A problem shared . . . ) And, since the play, by Declan
Hughes, is well acted and is often very funny, you can be sure the audience
leaves with a smile on its collective face.
My trouble, to be blunt, is that I just didn't believe it. This is partly
because I have only limited points of personal contact with two Irish
sisters who were raised to know every littlest thing about Elvis Presley,
and who remind each other of good yarns from the Old Testament. But then I
don't have too much in common with Electra or Macbeth, whose plights I
nonetheless follow with interest. Deborah and Mary speak to my condition
sufficiently for me to laugh repeatedly at their jokes (mainly Mary's). The
problem is that they approach their problems by way of Elvis and the Old
Testament.
Deborah is the idealist, Mary the cynic. Ironically, it is Mary to whom a
spectral Elvis appears in the night. 'You bitch,' says Deborah in the
morning. 'I believe in visions, and you get to see Elvis.' Through all this,
the sisters raise the unburied memories of the accident in which their
mother died and the unfairness of their father in subsequent years.
There is enough melodrama on the one hand and wisecracking on the other to
keep an audience held. Lynne Parker, directing, yokes together these two
contrary elements fluently. Anne Byrne (Deborah) and Gina Moxley (Mary) give
flawlessly natural performances, in which the twitch of a mouth, or a
momentarily prolonged facial expression can make the audience chortle. But
Declan Hughes's writing never persuaded me that this was a story I needed to
know, or that it would naturally end on so positive a note.

FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Glittering keyboard refinement - London piano recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Krystian Zimerman's glittering display of keyboard refinement and control at
the Barbican on Sunday was an unqualified delight. Seven years ago at the
Edinburgh Festival he gave what remains the finest piano recital I've ever
had the good luck to hear, Richter, Michelangeli and Horovitz included; if
this programme of Debussy, Chopin and Schubert never quite achieved the same
exalted heights, it was still a hugely distinguished occasion, full of
subtleties of texture and articulation, keenly focused energy and unfailing
musical intelligence.
In Debussy's Estampes Zimerman's powers were perfectly matched. 'Pagodes'
was rendered in glinting, lapping pastels, 'Soiree dans Grenade' almost
lazily impulsive, its climaxes vivid and intense, 'Jardins sous la pluie'
made crystalline and taut, without a hint of wishy-washy, fake
impressionism. Chopin's B minor Sonata was then launched with a similar
directness and rhythmic elan, almost evoking memories of Lipatti's legendary
recording. Zimerman did not quite manage to sustain the same concentration
through the first movement; the development section brought the only moment
at which his playing seemed to lack a sense of purpose and direction. Even
that though was quickly redeemed by a serene unfolding of the slow movement
and an ebullient finale, gilded by the most exquisite figuration.
Schubert's B flat Sonata D960 was not conceived on an epic scale, nor would
one have expected it to be. Everything was laid out generously - the first
movement included the repeat and much beautifully rounded phrase making; the
slow movement was nudged forward in a series of carefully sculpted
paragraphs; the scherzo offered seamless flows of perfectly purled melody.
Yet the finale revealed unexpected moments of sharpened intensity,
suggesting an emotional undertow to the whole performance which still needs
further performances to mature and well up to the surface.
* * *
At the Purcell Room the following evening under the auspices of the Kirckman
Concert Society, the young British pianist Graham Scott offered an ambitious
selection that included Beethoven's Op. 110 Sonata, Berg's Sonata and
Chopin's Polonaise Fantasie, as well as Franck's Prelude, Chorale and Fugue
and Rakhmaninov's Corelli Variations. Scott, who trained at the RNCM, made
his Wigmore Hall debut four years ago; he seemed on the evidence of this
recital an immensely polished and confident artist. The absolute technical
control one quickly took for granted, but each of these performances also
had an impressive clarity of purpose and dramatic strength.
There are still moments when Scott rushes his climaxes - the rapt unfolding
of the fugue in Op. 110 was marred by a hasty dash towards its climax, parts
of the Polonaise-Fantasie were unhinged by an outbreak of assertiveness -
but those few examples were more than counterbalanced by the calm
distinction of so much of his playing. The way in which he wound down the
coda of the Berg sonata, for instance, could never have been learnt by rote;
its careful sifting of colours and layers seemed utterly instinctive and
appropriate.
Ian Fountain offered a curiously short programme at the Queen Elizabeth Hall
on Sunday, though he managed to elongate it to near-credibility. He is
unmistakably a musician (at nineteen, he won the 1989 Arthur Rubinstein
competition); I thought he traded upon that lucky virtue to the limit of
indulgence. On Monday at the Wigmore Hall, the young Finn Juhani Lagerspetz
delivered three heavy-duty piano works - Schumann's Carnaval, Skryabin's 5th
Sonata and Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' - with tireless energy, imagination
and dash, and without ever inviting us to admire his own pianism.
We admired it the more, of course. Lagerspetz has all the marks of a
committed, inquiring interpreter with a sterling technique, but is much too
Finnish to make any overt show of that. By contrast, Fountain drew out his
first-half Mozart - just the C minor Fantasia, K475, and the Sonata K457 -
with infinite pains. He dwelt lovingly upon every phrase and exquisitely
balanced chord, and seemed to be aiming at Debussy's ideal of 'a piano
without hammers,' squeezing the notes tenderly from the instrument.
None of Mozart's quick sections developed any momentum; there were too many
delicate hesitations for that, too many phrases that went into a rallentando
faint. (Some notes simply failed to sound; I wondered what it all sounded
like further back in the hall.) After the interval, three of Liszt's
Schubert transcriptions were subjected to the same treatment - even
'Aufenthalt'] - and then Schubert's 'Wanderer' Fantasy too, its virtuoso
drive lost amidst so many sensitive shadings.
It was bracing to hear Lagerspetz the next night: first in a fine, resilient
Carnaval, tingling with character, but with sentiment kept firmly in check.
His Skryabin was better still - flashing attack, contrasts brilliantly
engineered, a complete command of the idiom and of the intricate form of the
work.
Lagerspetz's 'Hammerklavier' Sonata was a triumph. I have never heard it so
vitally realised by a performer of his years. He took the opening Allegro at
an intrepid pace, perfectly sustained with no loss of detail, and rounded
the work off with a fugue of splendid transparency and pith. It was the
great Adagio sostenuto, however, that made the greatest impression; he
unfolded it very beautifully, with steady, searching, self-effacing
authority. It was a full-blooded 'public' performance, certainly - but it
lost nothing whatever by that.

FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Dear Michael Jackson . . . - Television / Christopher
Dunkley writes to the new BBC2 Controller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Congratulations] You have just been put in charge of the best television
channel in the world. When it was announced that you were to succeed your
friend Alan Yentob as controller of BBC2, after his move to BBC1, you were
too modest and English to put it like that; you said 'I believe BBC2 is the
best and most interesting channel on British television', which implies that
somewhere outside Britain there is one that is even better and more
interesting.
I doubt it. In the past 20 years I have taken a careful look at television
in the US and Europe and attended lots of international television
festivals. There is certainly good work done elsewhere. Some of those
pompous politicians who bang on about British television being the best in
the world (having watched the breakfast show in a Washington hotel room and
I Love Lucy late at night in Brussels while hunting for Europe's fabled
porn) might be quite surprised if you showed them just how good Swedish
television drama tends to be, or American news, or Brazilian soap opera.
But have you ever come across a channel anywhere else with the range of
BBC2, from Red Dwarf to The Late Show, from Newsnight to Floyd On Spain
where the quality is maintained through so many programme categories? I have
not. On Sunday alone BBC2 showed, as the last in a season of 'Screen Two'
dramas, The Snapper, which brought an extraordinarily light touch to the
explosive subject of accidental pregnancy in a Dublin family; Every Picture
Tells A Story, which put as clearly as I have ever heard on television the
arguments for and against the radical renovation of old paintings; and in
The Nineties, a startlingly passionate and graphic account of the effects of
alcoholism before and during the First World War.
I actually thought The Nineties was not quite as impressive as Labour Of
Love, another series, recently ended, which also went to very old people to
hear them bear witness to history while they are still able, this time on
the subject of child rearing in the first half of the 20th century. But that
was a BBC2 series as well, or anyway an independent series shown by BBC2.
Since this is an open letter and the 40 per cent of FT readers who live
outside Britain may be thinking that BBC2 sounds like an awfully worthy
network but not a lot of fun, I had better point out that it carries some of
Britain's best comedy, too.
Last week it showed the last episode in another run of French And Saunders,
a female double act which, although it arrived as part of the 'alternative'
comedy boom, is now so well established, and so funny, that it is not
entirely crazy to talk about the possibility of these two young women taking
the place of Britain's immortal Morecambe and Wise. If only French and
Saunders would put themselves in the hands of a ruthless editor with
instructions to banish self indulgence and pare their over-long sketches to
the bone, they really could reach those heights. What is more it was BBC2
that brought us Jennifer Saunders's comedy, Absolutely Fabulous, which has
quite rightly just won two BAFTA awards; and the same channel again which is
about to start another run of the admirably dangerous comic news quiz Have I
Got News For You.
But this letter is getting bogged down in detail. What I really wanted to do
after congratulating you was remind you of the tremendous responsibility now
resting upon you. Television generally is moving down market, not just
nationally but internationally. Everywhere public service broadcasters are
being forced to compete for audiences and funds and, I suspect, for their
very existence against commercial broadcasters who are more concerned now
with ratings than ever before. In this country we had until recently two
'protected' channels where ratings were of less importance than programme
quality and originality: BBC2 and Channel 4.
Now, as one of the last gasps of full-blown Thatcherism, Channel 4 has been
driven into the market place and obliged to compete for its own slice of the
advertising cake. As you might expect with Michael Grade in charge, it is
proving a pretty effective competitor and is regularly achieving an audience
share of around 12 per cent instead of the 9 to 10 per cent that it used to
get. Whatever the people at Channel 4 may bravely proclaim about sticking to
the famous 'remit' to 'be different' and 'cater for minorities' I think we
must expect that Channel 4, at least in peak viewing time, will continue to
look more and more like any other conventional commercial channel with game
shows (The Crystal Maze) soap opera (Brookside) and the largest proportion
of American imports in British terrestrial television (The Wonder Years,
Mork And Mindy, The Golden Girls and soon The Golden Palace).
That leaves just you and BBC2 to defend the faith. True, under John Birt the
entire BBC is more likely to go for 'the Himalaya option' and attempt to
re-group on the old high ground than to move further out on to the plain to
concentrate on fighting ITV and the satellite people for the mass audience.
Yet the fact remains that, however novel it may seem to a man of Alan
Yentob's tastes (not snootily highbrow, more eclectic and modern, but still
many miles from the Bill Cotton school which has traditionally run BBC1) he
is going to have to maintain a relatively high level of popularity on BBC1
if the corporation is to avoid being pushed to the margins of British
broadcasting.
Which is why so much depends upon you. There is now no channel other than
BBC2 to which the more demanding viewer can switch, safe in the knowledge
that whatever is being shown - cookery programme, arts magazine, documentary
series - it will not insult your intelligence. This is not just a form of
words. I believe there really is a danger today, thanks to the immense
financial forces involved and the steady globalisation of the industry, that
television as a whole could become exclusively a mass-appeal tabloid medium.
As with tabloid newspapers there would still be good and bad, but, in sharp
contrast to the print medium, there would be no The Independent, no The
Guardian, no The Times, let alone an FT. I will believe all the talk about
digital compression providing 500-channel systems with niche marketing and
The Economist of the airwaves when I see it.
Meanwhile I look to you to go on providing Newsnight as the most civilised
and rigorous round-up of the day's events, and to open up The Late Show to a
wider spectrum of attitudes, not, chiefly, in its interviewees but in its
presenters. The programme covers most of the right subjects, but often feels
more old fashioned than Late Night Line Up. This does not mean 'popularise'
it in hopes of winning bigger ratings: we have seen such efforts on BBC2 in
last year's Young Musician Of The Year and in the current Soundbites in both
of which the essential content - music - has been sacrificed to chat, a
desperately retrograde step.
You inherit a tremendously strong foundation on which to build. The history
series Timewatch and the broadly literary series Bookmark turn out some of
the BBC's best documentaries these days, and the Video Diaries idea of
supplying amateurs with cameras to record aspects of their own lives has
produced some astounding triumphs. You would have to be crazy to harm any of
those. If I were you (and your new job is the only one in television that I
would ever volunteer for) I would immediately contract the After Dark team
to bring to BBC2 the open-ended late-night studio discussion series which
Channel 4 was mad enough to scrap. Then I would sit back and think for quite
a long time before making any other changes.
Good luck,
Christopher Dunkley

FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Overwhelming sentimentality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is good to see a lovely theatre full and humming, even if you do not much
like the play. So it was at Richmond on Monday for Ivan Menchell's
gloomy-sounding, but in fact remarkably cheerful The Cemetery Club.
Menchell is the only student of the Yale School of Drama so far to have
written a play which moved to Broadway while he was still studying. That was
in 1990. The Cemetery Club has since been turned into a movie not yet
released outside the US. Meanwhile the stage version is touring Britain and
if the Richmond reception is anything to go by, is going down a treat.
The style is heavily sentimental Jewish American and the influence of Neil
Simon, whose Lost in Yonkers is still playing in London, is pervasive. It
would not normally be to my taste. Yet there is at least one scene in this
production by David Taylor that redeems it all.
Taylor also directs Lost in Yonkers. Whether it is his particular
understanding of this kind of Jewish humour that makes the show, or the
outstanding performances by three actresses, is hard to say. But I doubt if
you can see Millicent Martin, Anne Charleston and Judy Cornwell, all of whom
must be slightly over 29, dressed as bridesmaids in little girl blue after
having been to a girl friend's umpteenth wedding, and having drunk too much
wine, without feeling a pang of pure pleasure. They command the stage and it
would be invidious to say which one comes out on top: they support each
other.
For the rest, the sentimentality is a little overwhelming. The Cemetery Club
is actually a group of widows who go to visit their husband's graves, clear
up the leaves, polish the tombstones and talk to their husbands as if they
were still alive every month. Meanwhile they think from time to time of
finding a new man. The women remain very close even while they bitch.
There is not much more to it but perhaps it is close to the truth. A
hardened theatre-goer told me at the interval that not long ago his
80-year-old mother-in-law had met her second husband in very similar
circumstances - visiting the burial place of the first.
Richmond Theatre. (081) 940 0220 till Saturday, then Peterborough, Woking,
Canterbury, Swindon and Wolverhampton.

War crimes are always perpetrated by the vanquished, never by the victors.
This is such a truism that you can turn the formula round and say to anyone
who still doubts that the Americans lost in Vietnam: of course they did,
their war crimes, from Hanoi to My Lai, are world famous. Who ever heard of
Vietcong war crimes? Thus the repeated attempts decades later, to turn the
civilian raids by RAF Bomber Command into a 'war crime' are a waste of time
since they were carried out by the winning side. Nevertheless Timewatch sets
out to whip up another argument (7.45 BBC2). Anybody with long experience in
almost any line of work will tell you that a good old 'un will out-perform
several good young 'uns. Pop music? Of course: look at Mick Jagger and Tina
Turner, combined age well over 100. Dispatches considers the absurdity of
'ageism' and points out the difficulties in everyone living longer yet being
retired earlier (9.00 C4). QED reports on the piddock, a shellfish which
glows in the dark and 'looks set to revolutionise the treatment of diabetes,
arthritis and heart disease' (9.30 BBC1).

FT  07 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: An unhealthy drink for a
nation - Leyla Boulton samples Russia's contaminated supplies / Worldwide
water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With three-fourths of its surface water unfit to drink, and a third of the
underground water supplies contaminated, water is a prime victim of decades
of abuse of Russia's environment. There is no shortage of horror stories
about what the leading western expert on ecology and health of the former
Soviet Union, Murray Feshbach, has termed 'water torture'. For example, Lake
Baikal, a natural wonder, is under threat from industrial plants set up
under the Soviet system of putting output targets before the quality of
life.
The latest horror to surface is described in an official report published
last week which says that the navy has for the past 30 years dumped
radioactive submarines and waste into Russia's northern seas - with untold
consequences for the ecosystem.
But today it is the more mundane problems of industrial pollution and ageing
water treatment systems that pose a direct threat to the health of Russians.
In Siberian oil fields, oil from leaky pipes is seeping into the ground and
rivers. The Kuzbass mining region is pouring coal-mining waste into the Tom
River, poisoning water for cities downstream.
In most Russian cities, sewage systems are decades old and are mended on a
haphazard basis. Poisons such as phenol, dioxins and DDT, strictly policed
in the west, are found in abundance in the rivers of the former Soviet
Union.
Economic and political crises are forcing important environmental and health
issues such as the state of the nation's water supplies to take a back seat.
Priorities such as economic reform, shoring up industrial output and paying
for grain imports mean there are simply neither the resources nor the
political will to clean up the country's water.
'When enterprises are being privatised and people are worrying about
production, they are not concerned about water treatment systems,' complains
Alexei Yablokov, a leading Russian environmentalist and adviser to President
Boris Yeltsin.
He notes that although air pollution fell by 12 to 15 per cent last year,
with a 20 per cent drop in industrial production, water pollution increased.
The country's first annual survey on health and the environment found that,
in 1991, a quarter of water pipes connected to Russian homes and a third of
those to institutions delivered water that were 'insufficiently cleaned'.
Yablokov says a direct consequence of poor water supplies is an increase in
intestinal illnesses. Even cholera has made a guest-appearance in recent
years. Victims of the last outbreak in 1990, in Stavropol and then Rostov in
southern Russia, drank river water without boiling it.
A federation treaty, sharing previously central government responsibility
for health and environment with local authorities, has yet to be
implemented. But no matter whose control they are under, tax revenues are
likely to be directed to more short-term problems in the future.
'This is not a federal problem,' says Yablokov. 'This is a regional problem
to which attention needs to be attracted . . . We need to introduce payment
for water and enforce payment for pollution.'
But there is no likelihood of authorities making people pay for clean water
in the near future. When market reforms have caused living standards to
plunge, most people cannot afford to pay more than the presently symbolic
water charges. Nor would the politicians try to make them do so.
The former Soviet Union already has a system of fines for pollution, but
many enterprises still find it more profitable to pay the fines than to
operate expensive filters and acquire clean technology.
Alain Dangeard, the former head of France's waste disposal agency and now an
international consultant on water and mining, says the west should be ready
for 'imaginative co-operation' with local authorities on overhauling water
and sewage systems.
'It is not just a question of money, but of technology transfers, and
institution-building. There is a need to multiply model successes of
co-operation to set an example,' he says. But an immediate priority is to
ensure that new industrial projects do not add to existing problems.
'One needs to clean up sources of pollution but one cannot clean up water
quickly. The main priority is that any new industrial contracts should
involve clean technology. Allowing new investment which pollutes would be
suicidal.'
Many of the problems are taking place outside Russia's borders, aggravated
by the break-up of the Soviet Union. Ten days ago the five Central Asian
states and Russia met to draw up a programme to join efforts in combatting
the Aral Sea disaster. The sea is drying up because it has been used to
irrigate the cotton monoculture imposed on Central Asia by Soviet industrial
planners. But Russia, having abandoned a Soviet-era project to divert
Siberian rivers towards Central Asia, is unlikely to put a nightmare which
is taking place beyond its borders near the top of its list of spending
priorities.

FT  07 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Changing colours - Victoria
Griffith examines the fickle purchasing patterns of green consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environmentally conscious consumer faces a mind-boggling array of
choices just pushing a trolley down the aisle of a supermarket. Forced to
make a decision between non-phosphate and normal detergent, recycled or
ordinary toilet paper and an array of other goods, an ecologically-minded
shopper may wonder whether the 'green' product is worth the extra money, and
if it poses a tangible environmental benefit.
Retailers and manufacturers are often as confused as their customers.
Anxious to capitalise on growing ecological awareness, they are uncertain
about the best way to present 'green' goods to buyers.
Despite the confusion, some trends are emerging. Companies ignore the surge
in environmental awareness at their peril, researchers say. Market studies
by consulting groups such as EJF Associates and Environmental Research
Associates indicate that younger generations, the consumers of the future,
are more environmentally conscious than other segments of the population.
'In our survey of adult consumers, 18- and 19-year-olds were far more
willing to spend money on ecological products than other segments of the
population,' says Anthony Casali, president of the Environmental Research
Associates. 'This, in addition to the growing awareness of older
generations, means that the market for green goods will explode over the
next few years.'
Even high-priced items such as cars and computers are being hit by
ecological fever. The Environmental Protection Agency will soon start to
hand out 'green' labels for computers using less electricity, and BMW, the
German car-maker, has been running advertisements based on its CFC-free car
air conditioners.
The new environmental awareness does not mean, though, that companies can
charge whatever they like for green products. 'We tested purchasing patterns
for a whole range of environmentally sensitive goods, and found that
consumers were willing to pay more for only 6 per cent of the items,' says
Casali. 'Of those 6 per cent, most were detergents and soaps.'
Given shoppers' willingness to pay higher prices for green detergents, it is
perhaps surprising that manufacturers in this category have been among the
most innovative in finding ways to slice costs.
US detergent manufacturers are beginning to offer consumers cheaper refill
packages, which do not contain the plastic spoons and other goodies supplied
with many products. The ecological argument is that the refills eliminate
solid waste by reducing unnecessary packaging. They also save consumers
money, and this probably accounts for their wide appeal.
The office products chain Staples has found out first hand how unwilling
many shoppers are to pay more for recycled goods. 'Sales of our recycled
products have declined in proportion to overall sales,' says David Graham,
head of paper buying for the store.
He blames the decline on the high prices of recycled paper. 'Manufacturers
have been charging us more for recycled paper goods, and we've been forced
to pass that on to the consumer. Clearly, shoppers are still very price
sensitive when it comes to buying green products.'
There is always the exception to the rule, though. Ecological boutiques, for
instance, still command high mark-ups on environmental products, although
market researchers point out that the segment of the population frequenting
these stores is small. 'The people who buy at these stores tend to be highly
motivated green shoppers,' says Casali. 'They also tend to be more
externally motivated than people buying green products at the supermarket.
They may truly be concerned about the environment, but they are also buying
into the image of the store. Carrying around a shopping bag from boutiques
like The Nature Shop and the Body Shop makes a statement.'
Edward Flesch, principal of marketing consultants EFG Associates, believes
the long-term trend will be away from the boutiques and towards the
mainstreaming of ecological goods. 'The large retail stores will not allow
this business to be taken away from them,' says Flesch.
The boutiques, not surprisingly, disagree. 'When consumers buy products at
the Body Shop, they know they're advocating an entire environmental
philosophy,' says Robert Triefus, group spokesman.
While boutique marketing may work for certain stores, larger retailers say
they will stick to an integrated approach in promoting their own green
goods. 'We tried separating products out into an 'ecological' section, to
create a green boutique within the main store,' says Graham. 'But that was
very unsuccessful. Buyers seem to prefer to see the products on the shelves
with the regular items.'
However green products are marketed, consultants urge their clients to
ensure that the goods actually provide the environmental benefit promised.
Retailers and manufacturers are concerned about a possible consumer backlash
as companies climb on the ecological bandwagon indiscriminately.
One New York furniture store, for instance, recently touted sofas covered
with unbleached muslin as ecologically sensitive. Since natural dyes can be
used with no harmful impact on the environment, some activists questioned
the green credentials of the product. More serious, perhaps, are findings
that US paper products labeled as recycled may contain mill waste, rather
than post-consumer waste and therefore be no more green than other paper
products.
'We are very concerned about a possible consumer backlash if companies are
not more responsible,' says Edward Tuescher, environmental director at Smith
&amp; Hawken, an ecologically oriented retailer of gardening products. US
retailers are calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to set
standards for green labelling to help address this problem.
A few countries, such as Canada, already have environmental labelling laws
in effect. Although companies may not have sorted out all the problems
involved in environmental marketing, it seems the trend toward green
retailing is here to stay. As time goes on, stores are likely to become
increasingly aware about the presentation and pricing of ecological goods.
Confusing as it may be, it is not only ecologically responsible, but
extremely lucrative.

FT  07 APR 93 / People: Backhouse takes seat at Ipeco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Ipeco founder Allan Johnson has been elevated to the life
presidency, his son Christopher, 45, is getting down to transforming a
private family business, which specialises in making aircrew seats, into a
successful public company.
The recruitment of a new finance director, Chris Backhouse, 36, from Ernst &amp;
Young, the company's auditors, is the latest in a number of moves to
modernise the Ipeco boardroom. Backhouse replaces John Cook, who resigned in
January after 12 years with the company.
Although Ipeco's announcement of marginally lower 1992 pre-tax profits, of
Pounds 3.3m, is regarded as a reasonable performance in a recession, Johnson
acknowledges that his company has not lived up to expectations in the six
years since it floated a minority of its shares on the stock market. Its
profits have been on a plateau and its share price is still well below the
120p issue price.
One of the problems has been the rather incestuous nature of Ipeco's board,
and Johnson turned to Pro Ned, the Bank of England-backed body which helps
find independent non-executive directors.
Since the start of the year Ipeco has appointed two new non-executive
directors - Julian Bell, former chairman of Rayner Coffee International, and
Alan Hornsby, a retired finance director of Smiths Industries.
Johnson is still looking for a new executive director to head the
engineering side, the smaller of Ipeco's two core businesses, to complete
his four-person executive team. Although he has no immediate plans to split
the role of chairman and chief executive, he does not rule it out in a
couple of years' time, if the business grows as quickly as he hopes.

FT  07 APR 93 / People: Grabiner moves at Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Grabiner, the marketing director of The Telegraph, publisher of the
Daily and Sunday Telegraph, has been appointing acting managing director.
His appointment follows the illness of Joe Cooke, 61, the company's managing
director. Cooke - a central figure in masterminding the modernis-ation of
the Daily Telegraph - is in hospital for tests following a mild stroke at
the beginning of last week. In a statement yesterday The Telegraph said that
it was too soon to predict when Cooke would be able to return to the office.
As well as being appointed acting managing director, Grabiner, who is 34,
has also been elected to the board of The Telegraph. He was first associated
with the Daily Telegraph as a Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultant and joined the
company as marketing director in October 1986.
Cooke's illness comes at an awkward time for The Telegraph since he has been
involved in the efforts to persuade shareholders of the wisdom of buying a
stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group.

Dale Electric International, the Yorkshire-based power equipment group, has
appointed John Savage as a main board director and to the new post of md of
Dale Power Systems, its recently-created principal UK subsidiary.
The appointment of Savage is an important step for Dale Electric. Dale Power
Systems groups all the main UK businesses in a new functional-based
organisation and was formed from three product-based subsidiaries. The
reorganisation is aimed at putting the company in the best shape for quick
recovery from recession, says Iain Dale, Dale Electric chairman.
Savage, 51, was previously md of the UK subsidiary of Merlin-Gerin, the

FT  07 APR 93 / People: Neil Hood joins Grampian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Hood of Strathclyde university in Glasgow is adding to his considerable
portfolio. He is to become a non-executive director of Grampian Holdings,
the Glasgow-based mini-conglomerate whose interests range from veterinary
pharmaceuticals to sporting goods.
Hood, 49, is director of the Strathclyde International Business Unit, and
has been professor of business policy since 1979. But he may be best known
for his off-campus activities. He is regarded as a marketing strategist of
international standing, advising companies and governments worldwide. In the
late 1980s he was director of Locate in Scotland, the inward investment
bureau at the Scottish Development Agency.
He is already a non-executive director at Shanks &amp; McEwan, Kwik-Fit, I&amp;S
Smaller Companies Trust (managed by Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund
manager) and Scottish Development Finance. He is also corporate adviser to
ScottishPower.
Hood is a man of great verbal efficiency; he can complete a one-hour
interview in little more than 30 minutes. After his stint at Locate in
Scotland he was put in charge of reshaping the SDA to prepare for its
transition into Scottish Enterprise. Later he made no secret of his doubts
about the wisdom of this piece of government tinkering, describing Scottish
Enterprise in its early stages as 'a morass of complexity' full of 'tensions
and uncertainties'.
The man who originally proposed the idea of creating Scottish Enterprise was
Bill Hughes, chairman of Grampian Holdings.

FT  07 APR 93 / Jobs: Recruitment - A mysterious matter of life and death /
Psychologist's research shows uncanny links between career choice and
people's longevity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IF you work as a financial manager in Britain
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and a lot of readers evidently do - the Jobs column has good news for you.
Your chances of living beyond retirement age are high. They are much better
than mine as a journalist although, whereas when you go it will most likely
be from cancer, in my case the odds are on some external cause such as
accidental or deliberate violence, including suicide.
My reason for mentioning the point is not gloom occasioned by last week's
admission that I'm now within 10 months of retiring from the FT. The
stimulus was provided by a fascinating talk at the British Psychological
Society's conference the other day by Ben Fletcher of the University of
Hertfordshire.
In his research into health and employment he has delved deeply into
statistics on mortality, and come up with some strange if not uncanny ways
in which people's work and their stays on earth are connected. To
illustrate, let's return to comparing those of you who are financial
managers with me as a journalist.
Now of course, being in the better-off tiers of society which typically
survive longer than the worse-off, both you and I have a happier outlook
than the average for the British population. For instance, if the overall
average chance of dying while officially still of working age is taken as
100, my prospect of meeting that sad fate rates at only 87. Yours, however,
is a mere 43 - provided you're a male too, that is.
Should you also be like me in being married, the statistical record has two
messages for our wives. The first is that, although they can both expect to
reach a greater age than we do, yours will be apt to outlive mine to much
the same degree as you outlast me. Message two is that each of them has a
far greater than pure chance probability of dying of the same thing as her
husband: yours from cancer, and mine from an accident or the like.
In other words, the careers taken up by men are powerfully linked not only
with their own lengths of life and causes of death, but also with those of
the women who marry them. Or at least that is so if they are British. Since
Professor Fletcher has not probed the mortality statistics of other nations,
he is unable to say whether or not the same applies in them as well.
In Britain, though, he finds that the husband-wife link holds good across
all 550 types of work officially listed by the registrar-general. In some of
them, the link persists even though the man's prospects change on reaching a
particular rank. For example, among public administrators below
assistant-secretary level the chances of either them or their better halves
dying before retirement age are well under 100. From that rank upwards the
chances of the men and their wives alike jump to around 110.
What's weirder still is that the connection doesn't hold the other way
round, with female bread-winners' typical life prospects being reflected by
those of their husbands. If you are a woman financial manager married to a
newspaper hack, for instance, then you alas cannot count on the better
outlook linked with your own occupation. Your life expectancy will reflect
the worse outlook of us journalists.
Illegally discriminatory though that may be, Ben Fletcher's studies*
indicate that it's the way things are, for the British at any rate. And
while there is no point in allowing it to distract us from pressing on with
our careers, his research surely faces us with a mystery. After all, even if
such links are familiar to and used by the actuarial profession, to know
that they exist is not to understand why they should do so.
True, it is not the only puzzle underlying our seemingly clear-cut ways of
earning our crusts. For a start, how we do skilled let alone innovative
things at all is still at best dimly understood.
Another puzzle lurks below the use of the term 'motivation' as a purported
explanation of variances in people's work. If they do better than the
apparent circumstances would lead us to expect, we say their motivation is
high; if they do worse, we call it low. But what motivation actually
consists of, nobody can be sure.
*Work, stress, disease and life expectancy. John Wiley. Pounds 45.50.
A few psychologists think it is like tension - until we've built up a
certain amount of it, we don't even start moving. But that view is far from
accepted. Indeed most shrinks never bother to ask what motivation is, being
content with just seeking ways to get creatures to exhibit the supposed
effects of the mysterious substance.
A further puzzle underlies the use by some recruiters of astrology which in
Britain, as distinct from France in particular, is dismissed as a ludicrous
way of assessing human ability. There's nevertheless something in it, as
witness the research of French psychologist Michel Gauquelin, which the
Oxford Companion to the Mind describes as follows:
'Certain professions were chosen - sports champions, actors, scientists -
and their birth certificates consulted for the exact time of birth (which is
recorded on the Continent though not in England). The subjects were
'famous', to be found in reference books, and their numbers ran into
thousands.
'Astrologers believe the rising sign (the sign coming up over the horizon at
the moment of birth) and the rising planet are of basic importance in
governing a subject's temperament. Gauquelin's analysis seemed to show three
other positions were equally important: directly overhead, sinking below the
horizon, and directly underfoot - the four quarters of the heavens, as it
were.
'The findings were perfectly clear. Sportsmen tended to be born when Mars
was in one of these critical positions, actors when Jupiter was there, and
scientists and doctors when Saturn was there.'
Even so, to this sexagenarian at least, possible influences on birth seem a
less pressing issue than what might govern events still ahead. Moreover,
while the trends discovered by Gauquelin were too strong to be explained by
chance, the statistical links found by Ben Fletcher look to be considerably
stronger. What does he think could account for them?
While the obvious answer is the varying stress that different jobs impose on
their doers, he believes it is the wrong one. Stress is too vague a notion,
he says, especially when it is gauged by asking people how far they feel it.
Those who say they're overloaded commonly show no ill effects, whereas
others who feel stress-free often go under.
His theory is that the cause lies in what he calls 'cognitive architecture',
by analogy with 'computer architecture'. It might be depicted as the basic
'wiring' which, without our being aware of it, governs our varied ways of
thinking and so our career paths.
That might at least account for the connections between jobs and the life
expectancies of their male doers. As for the husband-wife link, he suspects
it may be the product of the historic, if no longer conscionable, belief
that women are naturally subordinate.
Hence Professor Fletcher is trying to pinpoint the elements of cognitive
architecture. If that could be done, he says, people might gain
psychological as well as medical means of extending their productive lives.
But as he's scarcely likely to do it in time to add much to mine, all I can
do is wish him - and everyone else with a realistic hope of profiting - the
best of luck.

FT  07 APR 93 / Management: Finding the child inside the manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People need rewarding. Employees have different characteristics, and should
be treated differently. To be understood, be direct. To communicate better,
try to understand things from the other person's point of view.
The usual tips on how to be a better manager are so blindingly obvious they
seem barely worth saying. Yet as most managers seem to disregard such advice
most of the time, management trainers can be forgiven for saying the same
things over and over again.
One such trainer has developped a slightly new way of getting at the old
themes. Abe Wagner, a US psychologist, has adapted the principles of
Transactional Analysis - a branch of Gestalt psychology - to management.
With a bundle of jargon, concepts and psychological chatter he has wooed
many Fortune 500 companies. Now he is hoping to do the same in the UK.
Last week he told executives from the Department of Transport, the HM Prison
Service and Freshfields solicitors to let the natural child in them come
out. Wagner preaches that each person is made up of six personality states:
the natural child, the adult, the nurturing parent, the rebellious child,
the compliant child and the critical parent. The first three of these are
helpful states for communicating, and can be used to get all needs and wants
met. The second three are all unhelpful  - we should learn to snap out of
these states ourselves and try to get our business associates to do
likewise.
Suppose you have just failed to clinch a sale and find yourself angrily
musing about the inadequacies of the potential customer, your sales staff
etc. You are in 'critical parent' mode. The best way of recognising this,
says Wagner, is to speak your thoughts out loud, understand which mode you
are in and then allow the logical 'adult' in you to take over by giving
yourself a pep talk.
Suppose you find one of your colleagues stuck in rebellious child mode -
negative, obstructive and working badly. The worst thing you can do is to
play the critical parent by criticising. The best way of stimulating the
adult or nurturing parent in them is to behave that way yourself.
Cynics might argue these ego states obscure rather than elucidate - allowing
you to say something in a complicated way that can be more easily stated
directly. You do not need to invoke parents or children to conclude that if
someone is unhappy, you should try to understand their problem.
Wagner argues that the ego states give a handy frame of reference and
suggest subtle strategies for better communication. If an employee is
playing the child by refusing to work on Saturdays, it may be better to be
the child too, appealing to their emotions rather than their good sense.
How well these ideas will go down in Britain remains to be seen. Wagner
notes that many male managers have a general problem in showing emotion and
discussing feelings - 'they won't let the natural child out'. He suspects
that British managers are even more buttoned up than most.
'We as managers have a strong tendency to look and sound like parents,' says
Wagner. Employees tend to encourage this by playing the child, leading to
what he calls 'co-dependency'.
Managers have to really want to change their ways. 'The reason managerial
courses don't work is that they are usually used to change someone else.' If
they really want to change, then anything can be achieved, he argues.
Behavioural studies in the US have shown that unconscious habits can be
changed after 21 days of concerted effort. Conscious ones can be changed
even faster, he says.
If it is really as easy as that, management trainers might shortly find
themselves out of a job.

FT  07 APR 93 / Management: A boost to rev up the engine - Technology has
cut the time it takes T&amp;N to fill customer orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alister McWilliam's engineers at a factory overlooking Bradford, West
Yorkshire, have come a long way since 1989. Then it took them 26 weeks from
a customer's first inquiry to develop, make, test and deliver a new design
of automotive engine piston.
Within two years they had more than halved the 'time-to- market' cycle of
their company, AEPP Automotive. By the end of 1993 it will have been halved
again, from 12 to six weeks. 'None of our competitors can touch that,'
McWilliam claims. 'We've taken a leap past the Germans.'
That gives AEPP a global lead, since its two main rivals for the supply of
pistons to the world's car makers are both German - one with a smaller and
declining market share, the other still just ahead of the UK company.
Since Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Nissan and the rest are almost all
sub-contracting much more piston design and manufacture as they rush to
shorten their own 'time-to-market' for new cars, AEPP's breakthrough
promises a sharp rise in its sales, even before the current automotive slump
is over.
In stark contrast with most of British manufacturing industry, that surge is
already under way. Last month Bradford's manufacturing team, under director
Peter Marchant, brought into operation a fourth high-volume production line
to help meet the demand from Opel, the German GM offshoot. As from January,
Bradford has been the single-source supplier of pistons for the 1.6 litre
engines used in Opel's top-selling models, the Astra and Vectra (Vauxhall
Cavalier in Britain). This has involved Opel cutting off its previous German
supplier.
Two years ago Bradford installed a similar production line to help meet
rising demand from Ford of Europe.
As a result, the value of Bradford's car piston sales is already
accelerating - by a projected 16 per cent this year - having stagnated in
1992. A 20 per cent rise is projected for 1994, taking AEPP Automotive's
total sales to Pounds 72m. With unit prices falling, the surge in volume has
been much sharper.
How has Bradford done it? 'The main driver of our success has been
technology. Ten years ago, we wouldn't have got a German auto engineer to
even look at us,' says McWilliam.
'Now we're seen as offering not just high-quality volume manufacture, but
also innovation,' says Bob Bates, who last summer took over the top seat at
Bradford when McWilliam moved up to head all the piston products of the
parent company, T&amp;N.
Their claims are borne out by a senior GM Europe purchasing manager who,
from his base at Opel's headquarters outside Frankfurt, was instrumental in
taking the single-sourcing decision. 'The most interesting thing about T&amp;N,
aside from its overall engineering and development capability, is that it's
the only group in the world that can do us pistons plus the pins and rings
for them,' says the executive. 'Everyone else can develop and make only one
of the three.'
Bradford's success is the main factor behind T&amp;N's rise over the past decade
from number four in the world piston league to its position close behind the
market leader, Mahle. For much of its innovation - in products, in
manufacture and in design processes - Bradford must thank its relationship
with T&amp;N's corporate research and development centre at Cawston in
Warwickshire, 130 miles to the south. (Cawston's role within the T&amp;N group
was examined in the previous article in this series.)
One of the key product innovations to come out of Cawston has been a
patented way of reducing friction in bearings; when applied to pistons, it
cuts fuel consumption significantly.
But McWilliam says that 'probably the single most significant factor in
changing our stature' - and in slashing Bradford's time to market - has been
a computer-based design and analysis process called Rapier (Rapid Analysis
of Products by Integrated Engineering Routines).
Developed at Cawston in close collaboration with Bradford, it has been built
up steadily to incorporate a string of key features. They include 'failure
mode effect analysis' which allows engineers to predict problems in both
manufacture and product performance and to analyse them before they occur.
This has raised design and production quality sharply and has cut
development costs by minimising expensive and time-consuming engine tests.
For the past few months, this process has been linked directly into
manufacture, through the automated development and production of the machine
tool dies needed to make the piston in the factory. Die-making is now
organised as part of product engineering, not manufacture.
In parallel with the Cawston-based innovations have come several generated
by Bradford itself, which spends between 6 and 8 per cent of its sales on
development. Much of this goes on the application of Cawston's work to
specific products and on piston testing, but Bradford has also pioneered new
products, manufacturing techniques and even a special aluminium alloy which
helps reduce gas emissions from pistons by 10 per cent.
The closeness of Bradford's engineers to their customers was taken a step
further last year with the merger of the previously separate engineering and
marketing departments under one director, Brian Ruddy.
He has broken this organisation into a series of 'customer focus' teams and
task forces. 'Putting the different disciplines together is already
increasing the engineers' commercial and financial awareness,' he says.
Production engineers are still organised separately, although for the past
year McWilliam says they and Ruddy's staff 'have been working hard at
simultaneous engineering'.
With the exception of Bradford's innovation and speed, Bob Bates stresses
that 'we're not really 'world class' yet'. He has set a two-year target of a
10-fold increase in 'right first time' quality, and a 20 per cent rise in
total productivity - including capital as well as labour.
As part of this, jobs at Bradford will continue to shrink. A decade ago its
labour force totalled 1,570. It is now about 950, the latest cut being 100
people since last November.
Beyond that, Bates says: 'We've got a lot of work to do on culture change
and organisational effectiveness. We're not here to make products, but
money.'
This concludes a series on R&amp;D management at T&amp;N. Previous articles appeared
on March 12 and 17.

FT  07 APR 93 / Management: MBA numbers on the slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the MBA's surging popularity finally been checked? Preliminary findings
from the London-based Association of MBA's suggest the number of students
enrolling on UK courses this year has fallen by 10-15 per cent. A clear
picture of the underlying trend, though, has yet to emerge.
Roger McCormick, director-general, says the Association has done its 'ring
round' four times - but is still not satisfied it has 'an accurate fix' on
what is going on. Business schools can be notoriously secretive with the
result that the quality of some of the information may be suspect.
In certain cases the market has clearly collapsed. At one south-east
polytechnic, course numbers have fallen from more than 60 to less than 35 in
the last two years. But elsewhere there is tentative evidence that
administrators may be filling places with poorer-quality candidates than in
the past, and that expansion plans have been shelved.
McCormick is wary of concluding that the MBA bubble has burst. He remains
impressed by the resilience in a recession of the full-time MBA course -
which requires participants to leave a job and raise funds to pay for
tuition and lodging - and points out that the setback follows several years
of strong growth.
Since sterling's devaluation last September, moreover, UK MBA courses have
become more attractive for foreign students who speak good English.
There are 92 MBA courses in the UK, compared with 47 in 1986. Last year,
according to the Association, 2,500 students completed full-time courses,
2,500 completed part-time courses, and 700 received their MBA through
distance learning. The distance learning numbers will get a boost this year
when the first full cohort of MBA students graduates from the Open
University.

FT  07 APR 93 / Customs admits error over VAT rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE commissioners of Customs and Excise have admitted exceeding their powers
in introducing regulations on the administration of VAT from January 26.
In a memorandum to the Commons committee on statutory instruments, the
commissioners accept that they erred in introducing rules before the
enabling statutory instrument was laid before parliament.
The regulations were intended to remedy an inadvertent striking out of vital
rules concerning input tax deduction.
The committee found that the VAT (general) (amendment) regulations were
ultra vires - beyond the commissioners' powers - to the extent that the
rules purported to have a limited retrospective effect.
It rebuked the commissioners for not notifying Miss Betty Boothroyd, the
speaker of the Commons, and Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, that the
instrument came into operation before it was laid before parliament.
The committee also criticised the commissioners for failing to issue the
regulations free to people known to have purchased a copy of the defective
instrument.
The commissioners, explaining why they felt the need for urgency in giving
effect to the regulations, said the whole of the system under which input
tax deduction is made by taxable persons would have been jeopardised without
the re-introduction of provisions which had been 'inadvertently revoked'.

FT  07 APR 93 / Walker rapped for 'lack of candour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Walker, the former Brent Walker chief executive, had shown a 'lack
of candour' in dealings with creditors seeking repayment of Pounds 180m, his
High Court bankruptcy hearing was told yesterday.
Lawyers for creditors seeking his bankruptcy said Mr Walker had failed to
produce basic accounts of his personal income and expenditure since last
September when, to avoid being declared bankrupt, he reached a voluntary
agreement with them to repay debt.
Mr Walker had said he was unable to perform these calculations and could not
afford an accountant to work out the figures for him, said Mr Roger Kaye QC,
for Stoy Hayward, the accountants supervising the agreement. This was a man
was now involved in substantial business enterprises in Greece and Russia,
he said.
The supervisors, backed by creditor banks led by the TSB and the Inland
Revenue, are claiming Mr Walker has breached his obligations under the
voluntary agreement. They are seeking a High Court order to have it revoked
and Mr Walker declared bankrupt.
Mr Kaye said that since September, Mr Walker had not repaid a penny of his
debts, despite agreeing to pay the supervisors 50 per cent of his income.
However, his bank account showed big sums had apparently been spent.
Mr Robin Hollington, for Mr Walker, said it was too early to establish what
his client's earnings for this year would be. It was premature to say
creditors were being let down. The hearing continues today.

FT  07 APR 93 / PM hopes for fresh talks on N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR arrived in Northern Ireland amid tight security last night and
hoped for a swift resumption of talks on the province's future.
Before a reception at Hillsborough Castle, the prime minister said: 'We
would like the political talks to start again as soon as possible. They made
more progress than some people realised.'
He said that getting the various constitutional parties back to the table
would require 'persuasion and discussion' and that was the way forward.
Earlier Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that
the government may take the initiative to restart talks.
The last round of discussions between Unionists, the nationalist SDLP and
non-sectarian Alliance party broke up without agreement in November. Sir
Patrick said yesterday that the time may have come for the British
government to propose a plan to enable the talks to be taken forward.
Unionists have said there is no prospect of them becoming involved in
negotiations again until the Irish government changes its stance on its
constitutional claim to Northern Ireland.
But last week Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, urged London and Dublin to press
ahead with their own plans in the absence of dialogue between the province's
parties.
Addressing Northern Ireland Conservatives last night, the prime minister
said he looked forward to the day when a Conservative Northern Ireland
secretary was drawn from a constituency in Ulster.
He said he wanted to see elected 'as many people in Northern Ireland as
possible supporting Conservative values and policies.
'Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but until recently the people of
Northern Ireland had no opportunity to elect representatives of national
parties rather than those parties that are purely local in character.
'There is no reason why people here should be denied the chance to vote for
those parties which govern them.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Manx Budget aims for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DOUGLAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at
stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help
those on lower incomes.
Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister, said his main objectives were
'to strengthen the foundations for the island's future prosperity'.
Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2
per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds
brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at
Pounds 44.8m.
The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the
target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The
Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency
account will be included in net income.
The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and
20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent.
Personal income tax thresholds rise for the first time since 1989. A single
person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with
income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of
the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's
allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable
between partners.
The changes mean a single person earning Pounds 30,000 will pay income tax
of Pounds 4,335, compared with Pounds 6,942 in Britain.
Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income-tax
liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax-exempt Manx companies
face higher annual charges. These will be mitigated by removal of statutory
audit requirements. Annual duty on non-resident companies will rise by
Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 and annual fees for exempt companies by Pounds 50
to Pounds 300.
The proposed category of international companies and international limited
partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear an annual tax
charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively.
The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international
pension fund management companies.

THE commissioners of Customs and Excise have admitted exceeding their powers
in introducing regulations on the administration of valued added tax from
January 26 1993.
In a memorandum to the Commons committee on statutory instruments, the
commissioners accept that they erred in introducing rules before the
enabling statutory instrument was laid before parliament. The regulations
were intended to remedy an inadvertent striking out of vital rules
concerning input tax deduction.
The committee found that the VAT (general) (amendment) regulations were
ultra vires - beyond the commissioners' powers - to the extent that the
rules purported to have a limited retrospective effect.
The error would have been avoided if the regulations had not specified
January 26 1993 - the day they were made - as the date for commencement or
had specified commencement 'forthwith', the Commons committee said.
The committee rebuked the commissioners for not notifying Miss Betty
Boothroyd, the speaker of the Commons, and Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor,
that the instrument came into operation before it was laid before
parliament.
Dismissing the commissioners' claim that no 'useful purpose' would have been
served by giving such notification, the Commons committee insisted that it
could accept that a government department 'can give itself a dispensation
from the need to explain the reasons'.
The committee also criticised the commissioners for failing to issue the
regulations free to people known to have purchased a copy of the defective
instrument.
The commissioners, explaining why they felt the need for urgency in giving
effect to the regulations, said the whole of the system under which input
tax deduction is made by taxable persons would have been jeopardised without
the re-introduction of provisions which had been 'inadvertently revoked'.

FT  07 APR 93 / Early bill payment move 'undermined'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS' attempts to persuade public-sector organisations to set an
example to industry by paying their bills on time are being undermined by
some government departments, according to an industry group.
A survey of 129 companies supplying heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning equipment published yesterday shows that public-sector
bodies remain among the slowest payers.
The building management and construction arms of the publicly owned Property
Services Agency (PSA) had the worst record for payments, according to the
survey conducted by the Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association.
The PSA construction division has since been sold to Tarmac, the large
construction and building materials group, while the building management arm
is still up for sale.
Companies were asked at the start of this year how long on average it took
for organisations, such as the PSA, to pay bills after the contractors had
submitted claims.
PSA management took on average 93 days while PSA projects, the construction
division, took 91 days on average.
Other government organisations also performed poorly, the study says. The
Ministry of Defence took 42 days to settle its bills and the Home Office 41
days. On average government bodies took 27 days between receiving a claim
and making payment.
The association said that its members working on private-sector contracts
would normally expect to be paid within 24 days of submitting a claim.
The association said that the PSA, which acts as main contractor on many
government projects, refused to pay sub-contractors until it had first been
paid by whichever public body it was working for.
The association's survey showed that local authorities on average took 65
days to settle their bills while hospital boards and trusts took 52 days.
Privatised utilities such as British Gas and the water companies were among
the best payers taking 26 days on average to settle accounts.
The government recently published a green paper on the late payment issue
and by the end of this year large companies are expected to be obliged to
state in their accounts the average time taken to pay their bills.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man government yesterday announced a Budget for 1993-94 aimed at
stimulating economic growth while amending the income tax structure to help
those on lower incomes.
Presenting his fourth Budget, Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury minister,
said his main objectives were 'to strengthen the foundations for the
island's future prosperity and to continue and strengthen action already
taken to develop employment opportunities'.
The Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency, has had income tax
autonomy from the UK since 1961 and is obliged to operate a budget surplus.
Net income for the year is estimated at Pounds 192.8m, an increase of 3.2
per cent, and net expenditure at Pounds 202m, the balance coming from funds
brought forward from the previous year. Capital spending is estimated at
Pounds 44.8m, including redevelopment of the hospital and airport, and a new
courthouse and general registry.
The island's reserve fund will remain at Pounds 65.29m. Mr Gelling said the
target was to increase this to half the government's annual expenditure. The
Pounds 4.26m interest earned by the fund and by the island's currency
account will be included in net income.
The two-tiered system of personal income taxation remains at 15 per cent and
20 per cent. Corporate and non-resident's tax remains at 20 per cent.
Personal income tax thres-holds rise for the first time since 1989. A single
person's allowance is increased to Pounds 6,200 from Pounds 6,000, with
income tax at 15 per cent payable on the next Pounds 8,500 - an enlarging of
the band by Pounds 500 - and thereafter at 20 per cent. A married couple's
allowance is double that of a single person and is fully transferable
between partners.
This means a single person earning Pounds 15,000 will pay income tax of
Pounds 1,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 2,764 in the UK, at Pounds 30,000
income tax will be Pounds 4,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds 6,942 in the
UK and at Pounds 50,000 income Pounds 8,335 in the Isle of Man and Pounds
14,942 in the UK.
Mr Gelling announced a review of residence rules relating to income tax
liability of individuals. Both non-resident and tax exempt Manx companies
will have their annual charges increased, but this will be mitigated by
removal of statutory audit requirements. Duty on non-resident companies will
increase by Pounds 100 to Pounds 600 per year and annual fees for exempt
companies by Pounds 50 to Pounds 300.
The proposed category of international companies and international limited
partnerships, due to be instituted later this year, will bear annually a tax
charge of Pounds 300 and a fee of Pounds 600 respectively. The island will
introduce roll-over relief for capital allowances on sales of ships and
aircraft which should benefit the growing Manx shipping register.
The government also plans to amend pensions laws to attract international
pension fund management companies to the island, but no details were given.
Among environmental measures the road tax rate for the smallest-engined
vehicles is unchanged and the rebate of 5p per gallon on unleaded petrol and
diesel is retained.

FT  07 APR 93 / BES investments increase sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in Business Expansion Scheme companies more than doubled to
Pounds 957m in the 1992-93 tax year from Pounds 367m in 1991-92.
Figures prepared by the Allenbridge Group, an independent BES consultancy,
show that residential property companies attracted Pounds 950m, with only
Pounds 7m going to the small high-risk trading companies the scheme was
first set up to fund.
This was the worst year for trading companies since the BES began, and they
have not raised more than Pounds 36m in a year since the scheme was opened
to assured tenancy investment in 1988-89.
According to Allenbridge, Pounds 880m was raised in 1992-93 by companies
that attempted to guarantee a fixed return at the end of five years, while
only Pounds 77m went to more entrepreneurial schemes.
Mr Ian Pugh, BES analyst with Allenbridge, attributed the sharp rise in
takings to two factors. First, demand was inflated by a loophole - attacked
by the Labour party - which allowed investors to exit their investments
after six months using loans. Schemes using BES shares as security for loans
were abolished in the Budget, but not before they had raised Pounds 568m.
The second factor was that building societies, which had not previously
found a route for raising funds via the BES, fuelled the growth. Bradford &amp;
Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Leeds Permanent, and National &amp; Provincial
societies, Barclays Bank and TSB all raised Pounds 50m or more via the BES.
The abolition of the loans loophole has made it harder to raise funds
quickly, but the Building Societies Association believes that the BES still
offers a cheap way to finance repossessions.
The BES will be axed at the end of December, following an announcement in
the 1992 Budget. This could allow intermediaries to hurry investors into
making decisions.
However, the Revenue has signalled in three rulings - which are being
challenged - that it will not allow sponsors bent on using the BES for tax
avoidance any leeway:
It has refused to permit tax relief so far on schemes, launched just before
last year's general election, which bought accommodation for University
College, London. The Revenue believes they may have violated assured tenancy
regulations by letting the accommodation to conferences during the summer
vacation.
Loan-back schemes launched before the Budget by the banks BZW and National
Westminster still await a ruling on whether they will receive tax relief.
The two schemes each took Pounds 25m, but have not yet convinced the Revenue
that shares were correctly issued in time to beat the deadline - midnight on
the Monday before the Budget. Both banks have said alternative exits will be
provided if relief is not allowed - this could involve total refunds.
Investors in Country Gardens, a series of trading companies which raised
Pounds 15m under the BES in 1985, 1986 and 1987, have been asked by the
Revenue to return their tax relief with interest. Tax inspectors had decided
the companies were in technical breach of BES regulations by operating a
non-qualifying subsidiary and holding too much cash.

FT  07 APR 93 / Labour floats plan for recovery partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the document Making Britain's Future, Labour proposes a wide-ranging and
radical programme of change as the basis for addressing the decline in the
industrial base through partnership between the government and industry.
These are the main proposals and questions on which Labour will be
consulting over the next 12 months:
New commercial structures
How can stakeholders in a company such as employees best be represented in
its governance?
What is the best balance of power between executive and non-executive
directors?
Should the UK follow the model of the European two-tier board structure,
where an executive board responsible for management is accountable to a
supervisory board representing stakeholders?
There should be incentives for longer-term equity ownership, including a
review of the tax regime.
The law on takeovers should be reformed 'to improve the stability of
industrial companies and to reduce the diversion of funds into acquisition
rather than investment'. The burden of proof should be on the predator
company to show that a hostile takeover is in the national interest.
Bankruptcy law needs overhauling. What lessons can be learned from the US
system of filing for protection against creditors forcing closure?
There should be an inquiry into auditing standards and accountancy
conventions. Research and development should be treated as capital
investment rather than revenue spending.
An investment drive
Could building societies have a role in mobilising savings for investment in
industry as well as property?
An industrial investment unit should be set up at the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Pension fund law should be reformed to provide greater accountability of
managers to trustees.
What changes in the law would facilitate greater investment by pension funds
in productive capacity in Britain? How could they develop portfolios that
contained more direct investment in British industry?
Should capital allowances be used to encourage backing for long-term
investment and product development? Could investment in research be
increased by enhancing the existing allowances with tax credits? What new
institutions are needed to promote more direct investment in industry and
bridge the investment gaps left by banks?
How can private-sector finance be attracted in to public-sector projects to
strengthen the infrastructure?
A training levy should be imposed on companies which do not invest in
skills.
Strength to the regions
There should be a network of regional development agencies to support local
companies and co-ordinate inward investment.
How could banks and financial institutions develop decision centres at
regional level with real freedom to work with regional agencies?
Should agencies be able to float their own bonds?
Getting government backing
There should be a statement on how new policy affects industry.
Within the European Community, Britain must resist the transfer of resources
away from research and development, transport and infrastructure to
agriculture.
Greater use should be made of the European Investment Bank.

FT  07 APR 93 / West Midlands signals upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in the west Midlands are indicating that the long-awaited economic
recovery could be under way.
A survey of more than 700 companies by the West Midlands Group of Chambers
of Commerce paints the brightest picture for many months, with a marked rise
in orders and deliveries from manufacturers and improved trade for service
companies.
Manufacturers saw a 13 per cent increase in home orders and an 8 per cent
rise in export orders in the last quarter compared with the previous three
months. Service companies reported home orders rising 9 per cent and export
orders increasing 11 per cent. Companies in both sectors expect to see their
turnover increase.

FT  07 APR 93 / Early start for business loan plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revamped small business loan guarantee scheme will be ready this summer,
not in October as banks and civil servants have been telling potential
applicants, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday, Ian
Hamilton Fazey writes.
No firm date has been set but the DTI said the new scheme would be available
to business borrowers 'by July, and possibly earlier'.
Companies without security will be eligible to borrow up to Pounds 250,000
from participating banks or recognised small business funding bodies such as
enterprise agencies or venture funds. The present scheme's Pounds 100,000
ceiling will remain for start-ups.
The government will guarantee 85 per cent of the loan - up from 70 per cent
 -and the borrower will pay a 1.5 per cent premium for variable rate loans
or 0.5 per cent if loans are at a fixed rate.

FT  07 APR 93 / Council to appeal on pupil tests boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANDSWORTH COUNCIL is to renew its legal efforts to stop the boycott of
school tests by union members opposed to the testing and assessment
associated with the national curriculum.
On Friday, the south London borough failed to win a High Court injunction
banning a boycott of the tests by members of the NAS/UWT teachers' union.
The judge ruled that the boycott was a legal trade dispute because it was
wholly or mainly about teachers' workload and their hours and therefore
about terms and conditions of employment.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth Council, said yesterday that the
council would appeal against the ruling. The hearing is expected to take
place in the week beginning April 19.
He said: 'If the boycott continues, parents will be left in the dark without
the means to assess their child's progress against others of the same age
and without the information on which to judge the performance of individual
schools.'
Mr John Patten, education secretary, will today attend his first major
teacher conference since he took office when he addresses the annual
conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Cardiff.
The ATL, which has so far stood back from boycotting the tests, will debate
its stance on Thursday. But Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, has
warned that the union may reverse its opposition to boycotts.
The union's president, Mr Harry Isaac, yesterday opened the conference with
a warning that teachers were being forced into industrial action by a
combination of an overloaded national curriculum and flawed testing.

FT  07 APR 93 / Shorter degree courses proposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES are con-sidering radical changes to the academic year to
increase their potential student intake.
Lord Flowers, chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into the Academic Year,
said yesterday that extended summertime teaching could hold the key to
reducing the present overcrowding.
Summer schools could allow degree courses to be completed in less than the
normal three years, an interim report by the Flowers committee says.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed the proposals. 'I look forward
to a more flexible academic year in the future,' he told the first annual
conference of the Higher Education Funding Council for England.
'It would be welcome if, at the same time as enhancing the quality of higher
education, such changes to the academic year had the effect of increasing
the numbers of students who could be taught.'
Lord Flowers told 140 heads of universities and colleges at the conference
in Birmingham that institutions would be consulted before a final report was
submitted by the autumn.
Many universities and colleges were already introducing or planning changes
which would radically alter the conventional academic year of three 10-week
terms, he said.
Unions representing academic staff warned that changes under consideration
would require a 'massive' injection of extra resources.
'University staff have already paid the price for the under-funded expansion
of student numbers,' said the AUT/Natfhe confederation.

FT  07 APR 93 / Daf buy-outs at risk after plea on parts fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of management buy-out attempts at Leyland Daf was plunged into
further uncertainty last night after the Court of Appeal backed a component
maker's assertion that it was under no obligation to keep supplying parts to
the troubled UK maker of trucks and vans.
Within hours of the judgment the supplier, Automotive Products, made contact
with Mr Murdoch McKillop, Leyland Daf's joint administrative receiver.
The brake and clutch maker, a subsiduary of the BBA group, said it was
'seeking to establish the basis on which it (AP) can make further supplies
available, thus safeguarding continuity of Leyland Daf's production'. About
3,500 jobs are at risk if the buy-out initiatives collapse.
The talks ended last night without an agreement.
It remained unclear whether AP was offering an olive branch, or simply
seeking to defuse mounting criticism of its hardline approach.
Three Appeal Court judges upheld last week's High Court ruling that AP was
justified in refusing to supply Leyland Daf with more brake and clutch parts
because Pounds 750,000 of payments had not been made for jparts delivered
before the receivership.
The receivers, Mr McKillop and Mr John Talbot, both of Arthur Andersen, had
argued in court that AP's refusal to continue supplies breached European law
by abusing the company's dominant position in the market.
But Lord Justice Dillon said that in refusing to continue supplies, AP was
exercising the normal rights of traders who had not been paid.
'It is a regular commercial practice that buyers of goods are expected to
pay for them. I can find nothing to warrant the conclusion that the aim of
preserving competition under the Treaty of Rome overrides the obligation to
pay for goods purchased.'
The receivers had offered to set aside funds to cover the amount owed to AP
pending resolution of the dispute, but it is understood that AP's lawyers
rejected the offer.
The receivers say that other suppliers, recognising the importance of
continuity of supply if Leyland Daf is to survive as a customer, have
accepted undertakings that valid claims will be honoured.
The receivers' objection to settling AP's claim is that other suppliers
might adopt the same line, in spite of their current willingness to accept
the undertakings.
Leyland Daf's truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, and van plant at
Birmingham continued in production yesterday. But unless the crisis is
resolved, both are likely to run out of crucial parts next week.

FT  07 APR 93 / Ford cuts Mondeo prices by average 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD UK yesterday bowed to market pressures and cut by an average of 6 per
cent the prices of its new Mondeo car range, widely criticised by fleet
buyers since its launch only a fortnight ago as being too expensive.
The reductions formed a part of price and dealer margin-cutting measures
announced by Ford yesterday. These were seen by motor industry analysts, led
by Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, as marking the end of
Ford's long-standing ability as UK market leader to set the framework for
competition in the market for new cars.
Ford, whose move came on the eve of the launch of Rover's 600 model, also
announced cuts of up to 10 per cent on its Granada/Scorpio range of
executive cars and about 5 per cent on Escort and Fiesta models.
However, with the exception of the Mondeo, prices customers will actually
pay are unlikely to change much, because Ford also cut dealer margins on all
cars to 10 per cent from the customary 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Most
dealers have been giving discounts of at least 10 per cent anyway, all the
price realignments have done is reduce their room for manoeuvre.
The Mondeo price cuts will be passed on to customers because dealers have
had only a 10 per cent margin on them from the start of sales.
Ford said last night that the lower prices would apply to all existing
orders. Customers who had taken delivery of cars at the higher
'introductory' prices would be reimbursed.
Although the Mondeo price reductions average 6 per cent, there are wide
variations. The 1.6LX five-door Mondeo, expected to be one of the
biggest-selling fleet cars, costs Pounds 11,835 from today instead of Pounds
13,080 - a reduction of nearly 10 per cent. The 2-litre Ghia five-door drops
by only 3 1/2 per cent, to Pounds 17,450 from Pounds 18,080.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK's chairman, attributed the move to the changes in
company car taxation in last month's Budget. From April 6 1994 tax assessed
on company cars will be based on a simple percentage of manufacturers'
retail list prices. The price cuts and Mondeo reimbursement programme is
expected to prove costly to Ford, which has been losing heavily on its UK
operations.
Critics pointed out at its launch that some Mondeo models were Pounds 1,500
dearer than their closest Vauxhall Cavalier rivals, but that did not stop
the Mondeo reaching sixth place in the sales league last month, despite
being on sale for only a part of it. Ford's announcement also coincided with
the publication of statistics showing that registrations of new cars rose
for the sixth consecutive month in March, pushing the market 11.58 per cent
higher in the first quarter than the same period a year ago.
But doubts continued to be expressed about whether the recovery is as strong
as it appears, and the extent to which the statistics are inflated by
manufacturer-inspired market-boosting tactics such as large-scale
registering of dealer 'demonstrators' for which there are no final buyers.
These doubts were reinforced by the contrast between the car market rise and
a further drop in registrations of commercial vehicles, announced by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday. Van, truck and bus
registrations fell 11.75 per cent from the severely depressed levels of a
year ago and the market was 5.36 per cent lower in the first quarter than in
the same 1992 period.

<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of 750,000 local government white-collar workers yesterday
'flatly rejected' a 1.5 per cent pay offer from their council employers,
Lisa Wood writes.
Ms Jean Geldart, leader of the staff side, said that unions were not going
to be 'browbeaten' by the government's pay-control policy. The five unions
had lodged a claim for a Pounds 700 flat-rate increase.
Mr Charles Nolda, head of negotiations at the local government management
board, had told union representatives that there were no circumstances in
which employers could increase the amount available.

FT  07 APR 93 / Pilot blamed for North Sea crash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRASH of a North Sea helicopter with the loss of 11 lives in March last
year was caused by pilot error, Sheriff Alexander Jessop ruled yesterday in
Aberdeen. But he said Shell, the oil company, probably contributed to the
deaths of some people who survived the crash but later drowned.
The Tiger helicopter, operated by Bristows, plunged into the sea seconds
after taking off in very bad weather conditions from Shell's Cormorant Alpha
platform.
The sheriff said Shell had ignored statutory regulations demanding that a
standby vessel be informed when helicopter flights were to take place.
Shell Expro yesterday said it had taken steps immediately after the accident
to rectify its procedures.

FT  07 APR 93 / Unions may still be able to breach industrial peace: David
Goodhart reports on signs that employers have not used three years of
recession to win greater flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BRITAIN crawls out of recession, industrial relations present a picture
of almost unprecedented passivity. But some employers are warning that
beneath the surface lies a spirit of sullen acquiescence rather than
co-operation, which does not bode well for pay bargaining come the upturn.
In spite of recent one-day strikes, a small spate of high-profile disputes
in Scotland and the threat of action by firefighters, the Department of
Employment recorded only 22 strikes in progress in January, less than the
year before, itself a record low.
The number of pay freezes continues to grow and average settlements are
still falling to around 3 per cent. Behind the huffing and puffing from
public-sector unions the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit
looks like being accepted with little resistance.
The once militant Civil Service unions NUCPS and CPSA have even recommended
acceptance of a 1 per cent increase and there is little evidence of the
return of the 'fringe benefit' to by-pass the pay limit.
Nalgo, the local government union which yesterday had its 5 per cent claim
firmly rejected by the employers, may still be capable of some disruption
and the Fire Brigades Union might successfully flex industrial muscle over
its pay formula.
There may even be a slight upturn in industrial action, as there was right
at the end of the early 1980s recession, as companies finally take the tough
decisions on redundancies or benefit cuts they have been trying to avoid.
But a return to significant labour militancy is not expected.
Yet, in spite of passive unions, earnings have been rising - last year
average earnings rose 6.1 per cent, well above the inflation rate of 3.7 per
cent. And even three years into recession some companies have been paying
very generous bonuses for changes in working practices - 14.5 per cent rises
at ICI and several deals of 5 per cent plus at the privatised utilities.
There are signs that employers have made little use of the recession to
change bargaining arrangements. A senior official at one employer's
organisation said: 'Employers have missed a golden opportunity. Things like
annualised hours and individual contracts are still the exception.' A recent
report found that less than 100,000 employees had been affected by union
derecognition over the last five years.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of
British Industry, also points to employer passivity. He says that a recent
survey found managers in less than one-in-four private-sector workplaces
believed there were significant restrictions on their freedom to organise
work.
He adds: 'But the willingness to take advantage of this new freedom turns
out to be much more patchy. Over 60 per cent of private-sector managers
reported no actual increase in job flexibility or reductions in job
demarcation over the previous three years.'
There are other signs that the power of unions remains considerable where
they are still well organised. Manual and white collar workers at Ford UK
recently resisted the company's attempt to impose compulsory redundancies.
The continuing decline of industry-wide pay agreements may increase upward
pressures on pay in unionised companies as recovery begins. After the GPMU
print union refused a 1.7 per cent offer from the British Printing Industry
Federation the employers abandoned national negotiations for this year.
The GPMU is now pressing its claim company by company and, according to pay
analysts Incomes Data Services, has agreed a 3.9 per cent deal at the Lawson
Mardon Group. There have been similar developments at the National Bed
Federation and in the lock, latch and key industry.
IDS concludes: 'Decisions made in recession may have awkward consequences in
the future, for employers and unions alike.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Machine tool group urges investment help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE machine tool industry is urging the government to make it easier for
small and medium-sized customers to invest in new manufacturing equipment.
Leaders of the Machine Tool Technologies Association want the government to
introduce permanent 100 per cent capital allowances for small and
medium-sized enterprises and some form of cheaper finance to give such
enterprises more confidence in investing.
Along with many organisations representing manufacturing industry, the
association was disappointed by the chancellor's stance on capital
allowances in the Budget. It had argued in vain for the temporary 40 per
cent allowances introduced in the Autumn Statement to be extended and
increased.
The association believes capital allowance improvements and financing help -
such as fixed-rate finance for five or 10 years - should be focused on small
and medium-sized enterprises because larger companies generally have less
difficulty getting funding and are better able to make long-term investment
plans.
The industry's plea comes as figures this week showed that the UK machine
tool market contracted by a further 7 per cent last year to an estimated
Pounds 675m. This compares with Pounds 1.02bn in the peak year of 1989.
Exports fell 20 per cent to Pounds 329.3m last year, and imports fell by 9
per cent to Pounds 411.5m, widening the industry's trade deficit to Pounds
82m from Pounds 40m in 1991. The latest import figures, however, include
between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m of special production equipment for
Japanese-owned car plants.
According to estimates by the association, employment in the industry last
year averaged 14,600 compared with 18,300 in 1991.
However, in spite of the contraction of the industry, the UK is still the
seventh largest exporter of machine tools. Moss Machine Tools, the
Leicester-based company whose high-precision machines are used extensively
in the automotive industry, has been placed in administrative receivership.
Mr Nick Dargan and Mr John Wilson of Touche Ross have been named
administrative receivers.
The receivership comes two months after a deal switching manufacturing of
Moss machine tools, along with some production equipment, to the Derby-based
company Thomas Ryder and Sons.

FT  07 APR 93 / Move to avert rail strike expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS BETWEEN British Rail and the RMT transport union are expected to try
to avert the second 24-hour rail strike planned for Friday April 16.
The RMT's executive yesterday decided to allow a breathing space before the
next stoppage is due to take place so that a 'negotiated settlement' might
be reached with British Rail.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday: 'The opportunity is
there if BR want to take it.' He stressed that his union's dispute is with
the British Railways board and not the travelling public.
'As a responsible trade union we respect the fact that many thousands of
families and individuals will be setting off to enjoy a break this (Easter)
weekend. We do not intend to disrupt that holiday,' he said.
Mr Knapp added that the RMT was 'willing to resume negotiations to find a
resolution of the dispute'. The union is asking BR for a guarantee that it
will not seek compulsory redundancies among its members and for a ban on the
employment of contractors on the railway network.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, expressed dismay at the
decision to hold a second 24-hour strike and said he would be in touch with
the union to see 'once again whether there is scope to resolve the situation
through serious talking with a will to reach a solution'.
BR appears concerned to reach a settlement of the dispute, which is costing
the railway industry Pounds 10m for each lost day, rather than simply to
toughen its stance against the RMT.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, is due today to announce the result of its
ballot on a 24-hour strike and other action which could lead to further
disruption.

FT  07 APR 93 / MMC recommends ITV changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday recommended significant
amendments to the way the ITV network is run. It aims to ensure more
flexible arrangements between ITV companies and independent producers.
The decision was welcomed by the ITV companies, independent producers and
the Independent Television Commission, all of which had been in conflict
over programme rights.
The commission backed the finding last December by the Office of Fair
Trading that ITV proposals for running the national network were
anti-competitive.
It said there should be no rigid limits on the acquisition of programme
rights, and rejected the OFT's insistence that when an independent producer
agrees a programme deal with the ITV network, the network should retain
exclusive UK rights over the programme for no more than five years, with an
optional additional two years.
Instead the commission has laid down guidelines based on the network centre
being granted exclusive UK broadcasting rights for up to five years, with
longer periods possible through options.
The commission said it had introduced guidelines rather than specifying a
fixed maximum period of rights to reflect the different circumstances that
may arise in practice.
The ITC yesterday warned ITV that it would monitor the new guidelines, which
in effect make terms subject to negotiation.
The commission also modified an OFT recommendation that producers should
have the right to be commissioned by the network rather than having to work
through a sponsoring ITV company.
An independent producer will be able to agree a deal directly with the
network centre. The producer will then enter a three-way contract with the
centre and an ITV company, whose role will be limited to ensuring the
programme complies with the requirements of the ITC.
The commission also removed a barrier imposed by the OFT to ITV companies
having options on series and programme formats, which had been condemned by
the television industry.
Mr John Woodward, director of the group, said he was delighted at the
commission's verdict, but added: 'It looks more like a multiple car accident
for ITV. But . . . if they're happy I'm happy.'
Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of ITV, said the commission's document was
'a very very practical piece of common sense.'
The report was also welcomed by Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central
Independent Television, who also chairs the ITV steering committee on the
issue. He said: 'The onus is on us not to abuse the system otherwise we will
get investigated again.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Launch may end an era on Tyneside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TYNESIDE shipyard workers gathered yesterday to watch the launch at Swan
Hunter of HMS Richmond, a Type 23 frigate (left) hoping it will not be the
last in the north-east's shipbuilding history.
The ship is the last in Swan Hunter's present order book. The Tyneside
company is itself the last shipbuilder in a region that used to produce
about two of every five ships built in the world. The launch of the Duchess
of York in 1928 (far left) from Palmers in Jarrow was just one of many days
when huge crowds turned out. Swan Hunter, founded in 1874, has launched more
than 400 warships.
The future of the Tyneside company as a shipbuilder hangs on its bid for a
Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier, an order worth around Pounds 170m,
for which it is fighting Barrow-in-Furness-based VSEL.

FT  07 APR 93 / Fees cause most auditor changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEE levels were the most common reason why companies considered changing
auditors, two academics told the British Accounting Association conference
yesterday.
Dissatisfaction with the quality of the audit and changes in the company's
own management were the next most important reasons, Vivien Beattie and
Stella Fearnley of the University of Southampton said. Their analysis, based
on responses from 210 companies, comes at a time when more businesses are
putting audits out to tender attempting to cut costs.
In selecting new auditors, companies ranked technical competence most
important, followed by value for money of the audit service and the quality
of working relationship with audit partners.
The conference was also told, by Jean Shaoul of the University of Manchester
and Pam Edwards from the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology,
that the profession had done little to examine the lessons from corporate
scandals in the past 30 years.
Based on an analysis of the 250 accounting 'causes celebres' between 1962
and 1992, such as corporate collapses, frauds and takeovers, they concluded
that few of the issues at stake had been reflected in the agenda of the
Accounting Standards Committee, the former standards-setting body.
While the collapses since 1973 have been dominated by topics such as poor
record-keeping, stewardship of assets and fraud, the committee was absorbed
by more arcane issues such as current cost accounting.
In another presentation, Mr Iain Fleming of the University of Paisley said
advertisements placed in newspapers by companies to highlight their
financial results presented a distorted figure of their true performance.
He argued that the newspaper advertisements tried to portray to
unsophisticated customers and potential customers that the company was
financially sound.
He said they used selected accounting figures and quotations to portray
their results in more a favourable light than that shown by the full annual
report.

FT  07 APR 93 / Earnings forecasts 'over-optimistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS' forecasts of earnings are unreliable in predicting the figures
companies report and are nearly always over-optimistic, a study has found.
The predictions become increasingly less reliable the further away from the
results announcement they are. And more than one year before a company
reports they are little more accurate than drawing a straight line from the
previous set of figures, according to Strathclyde University re-search
presented at the conference.
The research supports recent anecdotal evidence of the inaccuracy of
investment houses' research, such as recommendations to buy the shares of
Queens Moat House hours before they were suspended, or Polly Peck days
before the company collapsed. The study was based on a database containing
69,258 forecasts of earnings per share made by analysts between January 1988
and December 1990, compared with the reported earnings of the companies
studied.

FT  07 APR 93 / Efforts to speed bill payment 'hindered'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS' attempts to persuade public-sector organisations to set an
example to industry by paying their bills on time are being undermined by
some government departments, according to an industry group.
A survey of 129 companies supplying heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning equipment published yesterday shows that public-sector
bodies remain among the slowest payers.
The building management and construction arms of the publicly owned Property
Services Agency (PSA) had the worst record for payments, according to the
survey by the Heating and Ventilating Contractors' Association.
The PSA construction division has since been sold to Tarmac, the large
construction and building materials group, while the building management arm
is still up for sale.
Companies were asked at the start of this year how long on average it took
for organisations, such as the PSA, to pay bills after the contractors had
submitted claims.
PSA management took on average 93 days while PSA projects, the construction
division, took 91 days on average.
Other government organisations also performed poorly, the study says. On
average government bodies took 27 days between receiving a claim and making
payment.
The association said that its members working on private-sector contracts
would normally expect to be paid within 24 days of submitting a claim.
The survey showed that local authorities on average took 65 days to settle
their bills, while privatised utilities such as British Gas and the water
companies were among the best payers, settling after an average of 26 days.

FT  07 APR 93 / Rail talks expected in attempt to avert strike

TALKS BETWEEN British Rail and the RMT transport union are expected to try
to avert the second 24-hour rail strike planned for Friday April 16.
The RMT's executive yesterday decided to allow a breathing space before the
next stoppage is due to take place so that a 'negotiated settlement' might
be reached with BR.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday: 'The opportunity is
there if BR want to take it.' He stressed that his union's dispute is with
the British Railways board and not the travelling public. 'As a responsible
trade union we respect the fact that many thousands of families and
individuals will be setting off to enjoy a break this (Easter) weekend. We
do not intend to disrupt that holiday,' he said.
Mr Knapp added that the RMT was 'willing to resume negotiations to find a
resolution of the dispute'. The union is asking BR for a guarantee that it
will not seek compulsory redundancies among its members and for a ban on the
employment of contractors on the railway network.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, expressed dismay at the
decision to hold a second 24-hour strike and said he would be in touch with
the union to see 'once again whether there is scope to resolve the situation
through serious talking with a will to reach a solution'.

FT  07 APR 93 / Computerisation fails to ease passport delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTERISATION has failed to cut the costs and time taken to issue
passports by the extent expected, the National Audit Office says.
The government expenditure watchdog says in a report published today that
the time taken by the Passport Agency to issue a passport was supposed to
have been cut to five working days. Although the new system has been
installed in all passport offices, it takes 20 working days to process an
application in peak periods and 10 days at other times.
In spite of advertising to encourage applications in off-peak periods, they
continue to be concentrated in the first six months of the year.
The NAO says that the agency could improve its service by differential
pricing to smooth the flow of work through the year - for example, by
reducing the price of a passport in off-peak times.
But the agency is reluctant to consider differential pricing because a cut
large enough to be effective might shift all demand to off-peak months.
The report also says that the Home Office Nationality Division has failed to
achieve its target of processing citizenship applications within 12 months.
Average waiting time in January 1993 was 20 months, down from 33 months in
March 1991 but still higher than in 1987.

FT  07 APR 93 / Tec sets up one-stop shop for training and recruiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council is setting up an independent
company to run a one-stop shop catering for the training and recruitment
needs of manufacturers in the city.
The move, seen as innovative in Tec circles, follows an agreement reached
not only with the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands and
Birmingham City Council, but also with leading industrial employers in the
area such as GKN, IMI and Rover.
The one-stop shop, agreement for which was finally reached yesterday, is
designed to provide a focus for industry. An employer wishing to recruit
would be able to establish quickly the availability of skills, while people
looking for work could find out what training courses were available.
The shop, which will be set up at the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Small
Heath, will also offer training services to employers seeking to develop
their business.
The shop will become the base of the industrial activity of Birmingham Tec -
one of the largest in the UK with an annual budget of Pounds 45m  - in an
attempt to avoid the fragmentation of training caused by the large number of
companies and training organisations active in the sector.

FT  07 APR 93 / Walker rapped for 'lack of candour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Walker, the former Brent Walker chief executive, had shown 'lack
of candour' in dealings with creditors seeking repayment of Pounds 180m, his
High Court bankruptcy hearing was told yesterday.
Lawyers for creditors seeking his bankruptcy said Mr Walker had failed to
produce basic accounts of his personal income and expenditure since last
September when, to avoid being declared bankrupt, he reached a voluntary
agreement with them to repay debt.
Mr Walker had said he was unable to perform these calculations and could not
afford an accountant to work out the figures for him, said Mr Roger Kaye QC,
for Stoy Hayward, the accountants supervising the agreement.
This was a man who once headed Brent Walker and was now involved in
substantial business enterprises in Greece and Russia, he said.
The supervisors, backed by creditor banks led by the TSB and the Inland
Revenue, are claiming Mr Walker has breached his obligations under the
voluntary agreement. They are seeking a High Court order to have it revoked
and Mr Walker declared bankrupt.
Mr Kaye said that since September, Mr Walker had not repaid a penny of his
debts, despite agreeing to pay the supervisors 50 per cent of his income.
However, his bank account showed substantial sums had apparently been spent
on travel, clothing and telephone calls.
Mr Robin Hollington, for Mr Walker, said it was too early to establish what
his client's likely earnings for this year would be. It was therefore
premature to say creditors were being let down.
The hearing continues today.

EUROPEAN construction equipment manufacturers are showing growing concern
over the volume and price of machinery imports into the European Community,
reports Andrew Baxter.
At a meeting in Paris last week they voiced fears about the amount and price
of earthmoving plant from South Korea and a possible surge in imports of
cheap machinery from China and eastern Europe.
According to an article intoday's Construction Weekly the construction talks
were described as unofficial and at an early stage.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Hopes rise for lower EC air fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European air fares spat of the last few weeks is a rare sign that
competition and recession may be able to cut costs in Europe's notoriously
expensive airline network.
The first shots in the battle were fired in February by UK carrier British
Midland. It introduced a cut-price three-day return fare to its 12
international destinations.
Many of its competitors, such as KLM and Air France, cut their own fares to
match during March. This week, British Airways turned a small scale price
tussle into something larger by cutting fares on seven routes between four
UK cities and the rest of Europe.
A business class return fare between London and Paris, for example, costs
Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318 a few weeks ago.
The fares war is unusual in two respects. First it is on short-haul routes.
Outside the US, short-haul has been a heavily regulated market and in Europe
has traditionally accommodated just two carriers on each route, one from
each of the countries. Competition is limited and passengers almost always
find both carriers charging the same high price.
Limited deregulation in Europe has now increased competition, and the price
cuts are almost all on routes on which British Midland competes with larger
carriers.
BA's lowest business class return fare to Paris is now Pounds 240, but that
to Frankfurt, slightly further but with less competition, is Pounds 330.
British Midland's presence is not enough to explain all the differences.
French and German business executives buying a return business class ticket
to London in their home countries rather than the UK pay FFr2,780 (Pounds
339) and DM1,128 (Pounds 465) respectively.
Perhaps more curious is the phenomenon of a fares war in business class.
Traditionally, airlines have regarded business class tickets as not price
sensitive. Business class passengers got a flexible ticket - if they missed
a plane, they could catch the next one - as well as faster check-in and
higher baggage allowances.
But business class bookings have sagged in the recession.
The latest figures from the 23 member Association of European Airlines
indicate that business class bookings have fallen below one third of the
total for the first time since the organisation began collating records in
the mid-1980s. The trend has been downwards since 1989, when 38 per cent of
tickets were sold at full price.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton Administration will ask Congress for an extension of its
'fast-track' negotiating authority until December 15 to reach a successful
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the
German economics minister, said yesterday.
Mr Rexrodt made his prediction before meeting Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade
Representative, in Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Kantor said a recomendation from President Clinton's
advisers to ask for an extension of the 'fast-track' was 'still on the
president's desk.'
Officials are believed to be recommending a final extension - this would be
the second - until the end of this year. They are reluctant to allow too
much time to elapse, since trade negotiators invariably use all the time
they are given before producing last minute compromises.
The Uruguay Round is already three years past its scheduled completion date.
Mr Rexrodt said he would prefer concluding the Round in time for the July
summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo. However, most US
officials believe there is too much work still to be done to meet such a
deadline.
The German minister said differences still must be resolved over
intellectual property rights and dumping and countervailing duty laws.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Power plant makers revel in Asia - Andrew
Baxter on capacity additions running at triple the 1970s' rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the deluge of facts accompanying Asea Brown Boveri's annual results
presentation last month was one nugget that spells business - and profits -
for the world's contract-hungry power equipment suppliers.
According to Mr Goran Lindahl, the Swiss-Swedish group's executive
vice-president for both Asia and for its power plants business, China and
Hong Kong will be adding 12,000-15,000MW of new power capacity every year
for the rest of this decade. That is the equivalent of Switzerland's entire
installed power capacity.
Last week ABB underlined China's status as one of the world's more promising
markets for power generating equipment by announcing it had won Dollars 300m
(Pounds 211m) of contracts to supply two separate combined-cycle gas turbine
power plants to Guandong province.
The developing economies of Asia, and in particular China because of its
sheer size, are looming large in the plans of the western equipment
suppliers. Power capacity additions in Asia are running at triple the rate
seen in the 1970s, while in western markets new capacity is being added at
only two-thirds of rates seen 20 years ago.
For ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, expanding its
presence in the Asian market is particularly important. The company has just
completed five years of trading since it was formed from the merger of
Sweden's Asea and Brown Boveri of Switzerland.
The result so far is a company that exudes technological and management
competence but whose financial performance has yet to dazzle. The company
has been hit badly by recession in several leading industrial countries and
business sectors, and is still falling short of financial targets set by Mr
Percy Barnevik, its president and chief executive.
Now both Mr Lindahl and Mr Barnevik are signalling clearly that they are
stepping up recent efforts to build greenfield plants in Asia and form joint
ventures in manufacturing, engineering and service.
Already, ABB has more than 20,000 employees in Asia and Australasia, and the
region accounted for 21 per cent of its Dollars 31.6bn total order intake
last year.
But Mr Lindahl plans to spend Dollars 1bn in Asia over the next five years
to make sure ABB exploits the region's fast-growing economies and their
demand for new power plants, related transmission and distribution
equipment, and transportation equipment.
Over the next five years, says Mr Lindahl, Asia, Australasia and the Gulf
will rise from the current 17 per cent of ABB's total business volume to
about one-third as European business falls back.
For ABB - and its big rivals General Electric, Westinghouse, GEC Alsthom and
Siemens - the next few years are likely to witness considerable activity
building on the joint ventures already concluded in Asia and forming new
ones.
There are already dozens of deals linking western companies to developing
country markets through manufacturing licences, technology transfer and
component supply. ABB alone is talking to some 50 companies in the
Asia-Pacific region about joint ventures.
A classic example of ABB's strategy is its deal announced in February with
Hefei Transformer Works, based in Hefei City, about 280 miles west of
Shanghai. A joint venture majority-owned by ABB, with HTW and the People's
Construction Bank of China as the other owners, will make power transformers
in Hefei City using technology and training provided by the European
company.
The production capacity at Hefei will be more than trebled to 5,000MW a
year, but there could still be several more deals like it, says Mr Lindahl.
In fact, spending Dollars 1bn goes a long way in Asia because the bulk of
investments will not be costly. There will be a lot of service shops and
assembly works costing anything from Dollars 1m to Dollars 8m rather than
Dollars 50m-Dollars 100m investments, says Mr Barnevik.
Getting the most out of Asia will be an important element in Mr Barnevik's
ambitions to improve ABB's operating margins from the current lack-lustre
6.1 per cent last year to 10 per cent in a few years' time.
All ABB's rivals have much the same idea, however. GEC Alsthom, the
Anglo-French group which is ABB's arch-rival in Europe, has a particularly
strong track record in China and Hong Kong, and with GE of the US recently
won the fiercely-contested Dollars 1.25bn contract for the Black Point power
station in Hong Kong.
This 2,500MW combined cycle station will be one of the largest in the world.
But there are plenty more where that came from.

FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Softer line by France on farm accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S new prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday asked leaders of
the country's farmers' to spell out their objections to last November's
US-EC agreement on subsidised agricultural exports. He warned them, however,
that he did not want a trade war with Washington.
In his first meeting as prime minister with the farmers, Mr Balladur
signalled clearly that while he might well try to persuade the Community to
renegotiate last November's draft agreement with the US on cutting
subsidised EC farm exports, he would not seek to go back on the Community's
reform of its own agricultural policy.
He thus asked the farm union leaders to prepare for him a list of their
basic objections to the EC-US agreement. This accord provides not only for a
reduction in the volume of subsidised EC farm exports, but would also give
the US more scope to increase its own soya exports to the Community by
restricting the EC's own output of oilseeds.
This followed a Gatt decision against the current EC scheme for subsidising
oilseeds. Mr Balladur was described yesterday by his officials as
'respectful of the Gatt decision', but insistent on some 'alteration'.
On the other hand, the prime minister sought from the farmers only a list of
'reasonable compensation measures' for the 'harmful effects' of the EC's
internal farm reform, officials said.
The implication was that the new French government would basically accept
the EC reforms which enter into force on July 1, seek minor changes in
Brussels and look into its own constrained national budget to see what extra
money could be found for its farmers.

ONE OF Japan's most senior trade officials, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama,
vice-minister for international affairs, has gone to Washington in another
attempt to ease trade tensions before the arrival of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, later this month.
Mr Hatakeyama is expected to reject a US proposal for quantitative measures
to track market access in Japan but to discuss the possibility of increased
procurement of US products.
The visit, described by the Trade Ministry as an unofficial follow-up to the
trip made last month by Mr Yoshi Mori, Japan's trade minister, comes as
several trade disputes threaten to flare up again.
In particular, the Japanese authorities are considering action against the
US carrier Northwest Airlines over what they see as that airline's failure
to respect guidelines regarding onward flights from Japanese destinations.
The Vietnamese government has given Bank of Tokyo approval to open a
representative office in Ho Chi Minh City which the bank hopes will be a
go-between for the increasing number of Japanese companies interested in
Vietnam, writes Robert Thomson.
It will be the first Japanese bank to open an office in Vietnam if, as
expected, the Finance Ministry in Tokyo also gives its approval.
Japanese companies have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site
for component supply to manufacturing industry. Most Japanese joint ventures
signed in the past three years have been in fisheries, agriculture and the
oil industry.
China has chosen Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japanese heavy equipment
maker, to provide a Y8bn (Pounds 46m) polyethylene plant for a site in Jilin
province, in the north, which will supply farmers with plastic film for
greenhouses and plastic food wrap.

ONE of Japan's most senior trade officials, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama,

attempt to ease trade tensions before the arrival of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, later this month.
Mr Hatakeyama is expected to reject a US proposal for quantitative measures
to track market access in Japan but to discuss the possibility of increased
procurement of US products.
The visit, described by the Trade Ministry as an unofficial follow-up to the
trip made last month by Mr Yoshi Mori, Japan's trade minister, comes as
several trade disputes between the two countries threaten to flare up again.
In particular, the Japanese authorities are considering measures against the
US carrier Northwest Airlines, according to Mr Ihei Ochi, transport
minister. The dispute centres on Northwest's exercise of rights to fly
beyond Japan on three flights a week from New York via Osaka and on to
Sydney.
The US-Japan aviation accord allows specific US airlines to fly to Japan and
on to another destination. Tokyo has argued, however, that in doing so US
airlines must not endanger the business of Japanese airlines.
Japan gave the US airline the go-ahead for the Osaka-Sydney leg of the
flight on condition that it kept the proportion of passengers boarding at
Osaka to 50 per cent or less.
The Transport Ministry said yesterday it was considering not allowing
Northwest to board passengers in Osaka on one of its three flights out of
the city to Sydney.
The US and Japan have been at loggerheads about the onward rights issue for
some time. Talks in February to try to break the impasse were inconclusive.
The two steel industries are also at odds over each other's activities in
the US market.
The latest salvo has come from the American Iron and Steel Institute which
has accused Japanese steelmakers of threatening an embargo on supplies of
specialty steel products on which US users are dependent.
The accusation follows a Japan Iron and Steel Federation claim that the US
anti-dumping action against Japanese steelmakers 'threatens the exclusion of
foreign steel from the US market, including substantial quantities of steel
not available domestically but crucial to the international competitiveness
of some sectors of the US economy'.

THE Vietnamese government has given the Bank of Tokyo approval to open a
representative office in Ho Chi Minh City which the bank hopes will be a
go-between for the increasing number of Japanese companies interested in
trade and investment deals in Vietnam.
It will be the first Japanese bank to open an office in Vietnam if, as
expected, the Finance Ministry in Tokyo also gives its approval.
The bank wants to tap into the flow of investment from Taiwan and overseas
Chinese communities, who are particularly active investors in Ho Chi Minh
City, which has a large ethnic Chinese population.
The Vietnamese decision follows a visit to Tokyo last month by Mr Vo Van
Kiet, the prime minister, who told Japanese leaders that a rapid expansion
of the Japanese business presence would aid the economic reform programme in
his country.
Vietnam has welcomed Japanese support, as the US has yet to lift an economic
embargo, which has limited Hanoi's access to foreign aid and investment.
Japan ended a 14-year ban on assistance last November, and plans to send a
study team to Vietnam in May to devise a plan for infrastructure
development.
Japanese companies, which have a high regard for the quality of Vietnamese
workers, have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site for
component supply to manufacturing industry. Most Japanese joint ventures
signed in the past three years have been in fisheries, agriculture and the
oil industry.
China has chosen Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), the Japanese heavy
equipment maker, to provide a Y8bn (Pounds 46m) polyethylene plant for a
site in Jilin province, in the north, which will supply farmers with plastic
film for greenhouses and plastic food wrap.
Japanese heavy industrial companies have reported a sudden surge in demand
from China, including steel orders running at three times the level of a
year earlier, as a capital construction boom continues in coastal provinces
in the north and south.
MHI said the plant will be capable of producing the full range of
polyethylene resins, and will have an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes.
The new plant will constructed jointly by MHI and a Chinese engineering
institute, in line with the Chinese industry's desire to become
self-sufficient in the engineering of advanced chemical plant. It is
scheduled to begin production in 1996.

FT  07 APR 93 / China 'trying to rein in growth'

<TEXT>
CHINA'S leaders are trying to slow the breakneck pace of their economy but
it is unclear whether they can keep it from running out of control, the
president of the World Bank said yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing.
'Certainly they are very concerned about the risks of boom and bust,' Mr
Lewis Preston told the press. 'We suspect, and the leadership we have spoken
to confirms, that the economy is growing at a rate that at least equals the
figures last year of 12.8 (per cent).'
'But I think,' he continued, 'there is an indication that through various
macroeconomic policies, (China's leadership) would like to see that growth
slow down to something closer to 8 per cent and thereby avoid the
disruptions of stop-and-go.'
Asked if he thought China could break out of a pattern that has seen the
government clamp down on runaway inflation triggered by periods of high
growth, Mr Preston said: 'We'll see.' He said that he thought that China's
economy could sustain a growth rate of between 7.5 and 8 per cent.
'The need to sustain growth within the bounds of what the physical and
institutional structures can handle is paramount in their minds,' Mr Preston
said after meeting top officials, including China's president, premier and
central bank governor.
'The need to do so without creating a stop-go cycle and retain the
confidence of domestic and foreign investors is of considerable concern to
them.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Patten defends Hong Kong democratic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, governor of Hong Kong, yesterday defended his much-maligned
democratic reform proposals for the colony by indicating that they were part
of 'the minimum values' which Britain could not honourably abandon.
In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Mr
Patten said a credible though not necessarily completely democratic
Legislative Council (Legco) was part of 'the framework of the rule of law'
to which both Britain and China had subscribed in their 1984 Joint
Declaration.
'The minimum value that we should hold on to is that the last election under
British rule (in Hong Kong) should be clean and fair and not rigged. Should
we allow the bottom line to be moved every time people disagree with us?'
In spite of his attachment to bottom lines, however, the governor said
Britain did not want to impose solutions on the Hong Kong people which they
did not themselves favour.
'Our position remains as it was. We don't wish to go further than the people
of Hong Kong wish to go, but also not less far than they want.'
He also continued to adopt a flexible attitude towards the Chinese
government and professed to be puzzled by Beijing's refusal to hold early
face-to-face talks with Britain.
There was no disagreement between the two sides that the talks should be
between the present and future sovereign powers in Hong Kong, Britain and
China, nor was there any dispute over holding them in Beijing. As far as Mr
Patten was concerned, they could start 'this afternoon.'
The governor was well aware that such talks would be 'extremely difficult
indeed.' Nevertheless, they would offer the Chinese the opportunity of
explaining 'what they would like to do about the 1994 and 1995 elections
(for district councils and the legislative council).'
'I hope that talks can start very soon and in a spirit of sincerity by both
sides,' Mr Patten said. However, if the Chinese did not agree to direct
talks, his proposals for democratic reforms would be put to Legco. Mr Patten
once again declined to fix a deadline for submitting the reform plan to the
council.

FT  07 APR 93 / Pakistan's prime minister faces toughest political test:
Cabinet rifts and a strained relationship with the president are weakening
Mr Sharif
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came to office two and a half years ago, he
was seen as a strong leader who would survive the intrigues of Pakistani
politics and complete his five-year term of office, unlike two predecessors
who were sacked at mid-term.
Believed to be a protege of Pakistan's powerful president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, and politically influential army generals, Mr Sharif brought a new
agenda of economic reforms. However, new rifts within the cabinet and signs
of a strained relationship with the president have raised concerns over the
prime minister's ability to carry on.
Yesterday, dissent deepened with the resignation of the minister of state
for economic affairs, Mr Sardar Asseff Ahmed Ali. Mr Ali, the fourth cabinet
minister to quit within a week, accused Mr Sharif of incompetence in
handling foreign policy and the economy.
He said there had been a 'wide front failure' in foreign policy which had
isolated the country from the world, and charged the government with failure
to clamp down on alleged terrorists who had come to Pakistan from other
Islamic countries. Mr Ali accused Mr Sharif of failing to revive the economy
 -a charge which hit at the heart of the prime minister's political agenda,
and at a sensitive time with the budget deficit expected to exceed the
government's target by a wide margin.
Some senior officials saw the recent departures as creating the most
difficult crisis of Mr Sharif's political career.
The previous ministerial resignations, as well as that of a federal
government adviser, were in protest against nomination of Mr Sharif by
supporters as president of the ruling Pakistan Muslim league, in an effort
to strengthen his position.
In addition, the provincial finance minister of the North Western Frontier
Province who was seen as the prime minister's protege was sacked last
weekend by the chief minister, a supporter of the president.
The latest rift began in January, when the president set aside Mr Sharif's
advice and appointed General Abdul Waheed as chief of army staff, one of the
most powerful positions in a country ruled by the military for more than
half of its independent existence since 1947.
The president has the power to appoint the army chief through powers under
the eighth constitutional amendment introduced by the late military
dictator, General Zia ul Haq, which also enables the president to dissolve
the national assembly and call fresh elections in the national interest. Mr
Khan used that power to dismiss Ms Benazir Bhutto's government in 1990 on
charges of corruption.
'The general's appointment brought simmering differences out in the open,'
said one senior official.
In response, Mr Sharif announced his intention to change the amendment,
giving more powers to his office.
'If you really want to establish the authority of the parliament and respect
to the mandate given to the prime minister, the eighth amendment to the
constitution will have to undergo a change,' he said.
President Khan responded by saying it was his duty to defend the
constitution of which the amendment was a part. Cabinet ministers close to
Mr Sharif said privately that the prime minister had become frustrated as he
found the constitution undermining his authority.
The governors and chief ministers of at least three of the four provinces as
well as some senior bureaucrats loyal to the president, were subverting Mr
Sharif's authority by maintaining direct contact with the presidency, they
added.
'The prime minister wants to take charge and press ahead with his plans, but
is just not able to do so in the present set-up,' said one official close to
Mr Sharif.
After last week's build-up of dissent, Mr Sharif was told by cabinet
ministers that he must end confrontation with the president. In response, he
held a 90-minute meeting with Mr Khan, and shortly afterwards announced that
his government would back the president for a second term in office, in
presidential elections due in November. Privately, some officials admitted,
the prime minister had assured the president that he would not press ahead
with his plans to repeal the 8th amendment.
Although officials close to Mr Sharif say that the differences with the
president have been resolved, dissidents within his party are trying to
gather support for a vote of no confidence. So far, prime ministerial aides
are confident that the dissent will not broaden to the extent that Mr Sharif
would lose his majority in parliament.
However, an aide to one of the dissidents said, 'It doesn't take long for
dissent to spread, especially when elected members fear that if they don't
get rid of the prime minister now, they may all have to pack up and go home
after the assemblies are dissolved.'
However, most diplomats believe Mr Sharif will continue in office because of
support from his home province, the Punjab - where he was chief minister -
and because there are few alternatives.

FT  07 APR 93 / S Korea to probe chaebol power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government said yesterday it will investigate unfair
trading practices by the country's large conglomerates, or chaebol.
The announcement by Mr Han Lee-hun, the chairman of the Fair Trade
Commission, indicated that the new government of President Kim Young-sam
will use anti-trust laws as its main weapon to curb the economic power of
the chaebol.
In a meeting with senior officials from the country's 30 largest chaebol, Mr
Han explained that the chaebol had grown too large and diversified to
compete effectively abroad and that their dominance of the domestic economy
prevented the growth of small and medium businesses.
He also criticised the ownership structure of the chaebol, which are usually
controlled by one family. The government is likely to impose new inheritance
and gift taxes to dilute family ownership.
The goal of the government's chaebol policy will be to force the
conglomerates to rationalise their operations and concentrate on a few core
industries. Some chaebol, such Hyundai and Samsung, now have 40 or 50
different businesses.
The government has already imposed restrictions on cross-shareholdings and
debt payment guarantees among chaebol subsidiaries to weaken the links
between them.
Mr Han, a former economic adviser to President Kim, said the government will
now investigate internal trade practices among chaebol subsidiaries that he
alleges inhibit fair competition.
Internal trading within chaebol groups reduces the ability of small
businesses to sell products and services to the conglomerates.
The FTC estimates that internal trading accounts for 21 per cent of
purchases and 16.9 per cent of sales among the chaebol.

<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE government of Victoria, Australia's second most populous
state, yesterday announced 17,800 public sector redundancies in a tough
economic statement designed to narrow the state's budget deficit.
The redundancies, to be implemented by June, follow the loss of more than
14,000 public sector jobs since the conservative Liberal/National party
defeated the former Labor government in October.
Mr Alan Stockdale, state treasurer (finance minister), also announced a
ADollars 247m (Pounds 121m) tax increase and spending cuts of ADollars 731m
by June 1995, bringing total spending cuts since the election to ADollars
1.2bn.
Mr Stockdale said the cost of the redundancies would raise the 1992-93
budget deficit to ADollars 2.454bn from ADollars 2.345bn, compared with
ADollars 1.6bn last year. He said the budget would return to surplus in
1994-95.
Mr Stockdale said harsh measures had been forced on the government by the
financial profligacy of the former Labor government.
'I think people realise that there is no choice. If we defer dealing with
the mess that the Labor party left behind, then in two or three years' time
the spiral of debt that follows from the deficit will force us to make even
bigger cuts,' Mr Stockdale said.
Most cuts will fall on health, social and education services, in growing
demand due to the sluggish economy and industrial restructuring.

WHEN THE job of Japanese foreign minister suddenly became vacant yesterday,
Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of a rebel faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic
party, was offered the chance to sit at the top table with the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations and turned it down.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, turned the need to appoint a foreign
minister into a great opportunity to embarrass a political rival, as Mr Hata
glumly explained that his role in a domestic political reform campaign was
more important than the ministerial post.
After Mr Hata turned down the job, made vacant by Mr Michio Watanabe's
resignation yesterday due to failing health, Mr Miyazawa offered it to
another member of the Watanabe faction, Mr Kabun Muto, 66 - a former
minister of international trade and industry and Mr Watanabe's choice,
accepted the post.
Prime Minister Miyazawa knew that Mr Hata, highly regarded by the public,
would agonise over the decision, as Japan is to chair the G7 this year. Mr
Hata would have been host to a meeting of foreign and finance ministers next
week to discuss Russia, and taken a leading role in preparations for a July
summit.
Mr Watanabe, 69, was admitted to hospital yesterday suffering from a 'a cold
and overwork'. It was the third time in a year he has had to seek hospital
treatment, and he conceded that he was not fit enough to cope with a tough
schedule in coming months.
The loss of Mr Watanabe will be a blow to Japanese foreign policy, as he is
regarded a powerful operator within the ministry, capable of forcing the
bureaucracy to react quickly. A European diplomat said: 'Mr Watanabe was a
man who could get things done, but I'm not sure the same could be said about
his successor.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Rising yen adds urgency to 'post-bubble' restructuring:
Robert Thomson on a 10 per cent appreciation in Japan's currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the yen surged in recent days, the first shout of pain came from
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party. It apparently second-guessed
industry concerns by suggesting that the yen's strength would be high on the
agenda for the Group of Seven industrialised nations.
With G7 countries more concerned about the rouble than the yen, the LDP idea
was quickly rejected by Japan's ministry of finance and the Economic
Planning Agency, and even by export industries, which have shown surprising
calm as the yen has hit post-war highs each day on foreign exchange markets.
The Japanese currency has appreciated 10 per cent against the dollar since
mid-January, and the trend has gathered momentum over the past week,
prompting the Bank of Japan to intervene in the Tokyo foreign exchange
market last Friday and on Monday to support the dollar.
By the reckoning of the EPA, a 10 per cent yen appreciation will lead to a
0.48 per cent contraction in gross national product. But it will also lead
to a 1.3 per cent fall in consumer prices, thanks to lower costs for
imported commodities.
In the short term, the EPA expects the current account surplus, a record
Dollars 117.6bn (Pounds 82.8bn) last year, to rise, but higher export prices
should mean a longer-term fall in the surplus.
The yen-dollar rate is of most concern to Japanese companies reliant on
trade, as about 60 per cent of export contracts and 83 per cent of import
contracts were denominated in dollars last year. But the Bank of Japan
apparently intervened, not out of concern for the impact on these companies,
but more because the bank wanted to stop what it saw as an unhealthy surge
of speculative interest in the yen.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor, reflected the desire for calm when he
said 'exchange rates should reflect the economic fundamentals of a country
and be stable'. Given that Mr Mieno expects a Japanese recovery will come
late this year, he saw the volatile movement of the yen, which hit Y113.30
to the dollar on Monday, as way out of line with the fundamentals.
For most Japanese manufacturers, yen appreciation is another reason to
intensify restructuring programmes begun after the currency's sharp rise in
the mid-1980s, inspired by the Plaza Accord in September 1985. Companies are
relatively calm because the Y110 level was looming six years ago. Then the
dollar rate hit Y120.45 and suddenly retreated, easing the pressure on
export industries to find cheaper sites elsewhere in Asia.
The yen weakened until April 1990, when it reached a low of Y160.35, and
began an ascent that continues. Curiously, the year 1990 also marked the low
point, Dollars 35.76bn, for the current account surplus, which more than
doubled in 1991 and rose another 61 per cent last year, prompting US
officials to call for another strengthening of the yen.
EPA officials say the 'bubble economy', the speculative excesses and rapid
spending growth of the late 1980s, is to blame for the contradictory figures
during that period - weaker yen, lower surplus, instead of the other way
around. The bubble era also distorted the investment decisions of
manufacturers, who had record increases in profits and miscalculated on
forecasts for domestic demand, the cost of capital and return on domestic
investment.
The result was that car and electronics manufacturers who should have put
more low-cost factories in Thailand and southern China instead placed them
in Kyushu, the southern island of Japan.
Manufacturers are stuck with high production costs and excess capacity at
home, leaving them with an operating profit margin of less than 3 per cent
for the year ended in March. In 1986, after the 'yen shock' of the Plaza
Accord, the average profit margin was 3.2 per cent, while the oil-shock
affected low of 1975 was 4.5 per cent.
Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, an Asian region specialist at UBS Securities, said
manufacturers could easily increase production capacity in south-east Asia
at the expense of their domestic facilities: 'But the question they must
confront is what production are they going to leave for their workers in
Japan? These foreign plants are, technically, very capable, but the
companies have to find something for their workers to do.'

FT  07 APR 93 / Industry looks abroad again to cut costs: Michiyo Nakamoto
on company news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE relentless rise of the yen against the dollar has presented large
sections of Japanese industry with a significant obstacle to recovery.
Exporters, such as motor vehicles, electronics and industrial machinery
manufacturers which have drawn up business plans for the first half of the
fiscal year at a currency rate closer to Y115-Y120 to the dollar compared
with the Y114.28 at which it closed yesterday, are staring at the prospect
of substantially reduced revenues if the trend continues.
Pioneer, the audio-visual manufacturer, says that it loses about Y800m with
each Y1 rise in the yen's value against the dollar.
In addition to lower dollar-based earnings, the impact of the yen's rise is
already being reflected in some areas in the reduced cost-competitiveness of
Japanese industry.
Japanese vehicle manufacturers, for example, saw their share of the US
market eroded in March by the need to raise prices to deal with the yen's
rise. Sales of imported Japanese cars in particular fell 13.2 per cent.
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries says that customers are becoming less
willing to pay for its ships in yen as they have traditionally done. 'If
Japanese manufacturers insist on yen-based payments, orders may go to the
Koreans,' an IHI representative says.
The adverse impact of the higher yen is thus focusing the minds of Japanese
corporations on speeding up measures to cope with lower export revenues and
reduced cost competitiveness.
Companies talk of accelerating the transfer of production overseas, greater
efforts to procure components locally where overseas production exists and a
possible rise in imports of foreign products which are more cost effective
than domestic products.
The lessons of the previous period of endaka, or high yen, in the
mid-to-late 1980s have already led most big companies that depend on exports
to any large degree to move manufacturing overseas.
Sega, the video games manufacturer, says that 80 per cent of its video games
sold overseas are also manufactured overseas. The company is able to offset
the impact of a weaker dollar by the fact that 50 per cent of dollar-based
revenues go towards dollar-based payments.
However, the trend to shift manufacturing outside of Japan is likely to see
a renewed surge with the further rise of the yen, with China and other
low-labour-cost areas increasingly popular choices for investment.
Aiwa, which already manufactures 65 per cent of its products overseas, says
that if the Japanese currency continues to strengthen it will have to
consider moving more production out of Japan.
Chiyoda, the plant manufacturer, procures 60 per cent of its components used
in overseas manufacturing locally, but believes it will have to raise that
level further.
Meanwhile, the yen's rise could trigger a greater willingness to look
overseas for components which raise companies' cost competitiveness at home.
IHI said yesterday it would increase the proportion of imported components
in its aircraft engines from 50 per cent to 70 per cent in an effort to
reduce costs.
These measures will no doubt serve to soften the impact of the yen's surge.
But they are by no means aimed solely at dealing with it. Japanese companies
faced with a persistent domestic slump and weak markets elsewhere have
already been working on reducing overall costs.
'The main strategy is to have competitive products that will sell even if we
have to raise prices,' says a representative of Nikon, the camera and
precision instruments maker.
The rise of the yen, he says, 'will put pressure on Japanese companies to
invest more in technological advances to raise their international
competitiveness. That is not only a response to endaka, but the way
forward.'

FT  07 APR 93 / After Jamaica PM's easy election victory: now for the
difficult bit - Canute James on the daunting tasks awaiting Patterson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE aftermath of the heady celebrations of the landslide victory of the
People's National party in last week's general election in Jamaica, Mr P J
Patterson, the prime minister, is likely to be quickly sobered when he
reflects on the immediate tasks of his administration.
One is how to fire the lethargic economy of the island which has yet to
react to the policies which Mr Patterson says are intended to stimulate
growth.
Another is how to counter an outbreak of violent crime, including factional
violence during the election campaign which caused 11 deaths. Related to
that is reform to the island's electoral system dogged by administrative
deficiencies and thuggery at polling stations.
Mr Patterson, who was sworn in at the weekend for a five-year term, has
promised to continue the economic reforms started four years ago when the
PNP ended nine years of government by the Jamaica Labour party of Mr Edward
Seaga.
The programme has been based on extensive deregulation of the economy,
including the sensitive foreign exchange market, and the divestment of state
economic enterprises. The intention, the prime minister said, is to allow
market forces a free hand and to reduce the government's involvement in the
economy.
By all indications, Mr Patterson should not have had such an easy time of
the election. The 2.3m people of the island have undergone painful
dislocation because of the wrenching adjustment in the wake of the
deregulation of the economy.
The floating of the Jamaican dollar 17 months ago led to a fall of 40 per
cent against the US dollar. The depreciation, and earlier movements of the
currency, pushed inflation to 105 per cent late in 1991.
The government applied various monetary measures to reduce liquidity and
ease pressure on the Jamaican dollar, but a fleeting impression of stability
for two months just over a year ago was shattered by another fall of 26 per
cent after the resignation as prime minister of Mr Michael Manley.
A subsequent revaluation has brought some stability, with inflation last
year at 17 per cent. But the majority poor of Jamaica have suffered most
from the changes.
The government's efforts to eliminate the fiscal deficit and ease pressure
on the exchange rate have led to cuts which have reduced the availability of
social services such as health and education. Much of the island's physical
infrastructure is in disrepair.
To have taken 55 of the 60 seats at stake in these circumstances represents
no mean achievement. But Mr Patterson may be the first to admit, if only to
himself, that he owes much to the disarray within the opposition Labour
party. For the past two years Labour has been diverted by a split within the
leadership, in which rebel MPs have tried to remove Mr Seaga, blaming his
leadership for the party's electoral misfortunes.
Mr Patterson was also aided by the absence of any fundamental differences in
the economic policies of both parties, in spite of Labour's contention that
the PNP had gone too far and too fast in de-regulating the economy.
Mr Seaga has indicated that he will reconsider his position as Labour's
leader. Party spokesmen have said he will be stepping down to concentrate on
private business. His successor will have a difficult task in rebuilding the
shattered ranks of the constituency parties before mounting a credible
challenge to the PNP in five years.
But in spite of the electoral debacle which has overtaken Labour, Mr Seaga,
or his successor, may not be too envious of Mr Patterson. The PNP's
landslide has raised hopes which the prime minister and his administration
may not be able to fulfil. The prime minister has spoken, for example, of an
intention to reduce unemployment, currently at 18 per cent, to 12 per cent
over the next five years.
But there is no sign of the significant new investments which the government
expects from economic deregulation. The traditional pillars - tourism,
bauxite mining and refining, agriculture and light manufacturing - all
depend on the health of the not very healthy industrialised economies.
Bankers and businessmen have suggested that the Jamaican dollar will come
under pressure in the next few months. A currency depreciation would lead to
price increases, and the blame would be placed squarely on Mr Patterson.
The prime minister has promised changes in the electoral system to make it
more efficient and less prone to abuse and thuggery.
He will find it more difficult to curb other unsavoury aspects of Jamaican
politics. In a country where party political passions run high, it does not
take much for one faction to launch a crusade against the dogs of war of the
other side.
Unless Mr Patterson and other political leaders can find ways to temper the
zeal of their supporters, the prime minister may discover that the economic
improvement, of which he speaks confidently, would be substantially
devalued.

FT  07 APR 93 / Clinton forced to postpone Dollars 16bn stimulus spending
bill

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress have bowed to
the immovability of Senate Republicans and agreed to put off consideration
of the president's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) stimulus spending bill until
after the two-week recess.
Senator George Mitchell, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, and Senator
Robert Byrd, chairman of the appropriations committee, have been given the
go-ahead by the White House to negotiate with their Republican counterparts
on a compromise that might allow the bill to come to a vote.
Although the Democrats have enough votes to pass the spending package, they
lack the three-fifths majority required under the Senate's eccentric rules
of procedure to shut off debate.
The Republican filibuster showed less physical endurance than past efforts
to hold up legislation, such as Senator Strom Thurmond's record 24-hour
speech against civil rights legislation in 1957.
Nevertheless it appears to have been effective, in forcing the Democratic
majority to back off.
Mr Clinton said yesterday he was 'working on a proposal that I think will
address some of the legitimate expressed objections.' But he remained
pugnacious in tone, and it appeared unlikely that he would be willing to cut
enough spending from the bill to satisfy the opposition.
He accused the Republicans of thwarting majority rule, and of political
posturing. 'It's just more gridlock and I think the people will rebel
against it,' Mr Clinton said.
Mr Clinton's problem in the Senate could be repeated in future. So long as
the 43 Republicans remain united against him, the 57 Democrats will fall
short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster - even in the unlikely
event that they too remain united.
Party loyalties are rarely solid in the Congress, and especially not in the
Senate. Indeed, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, though nominally
Democratic, has voted so consistently against Mr Clinton that party whips
are virtually discounting him when they count up likely votes.
But a number of other Democratic conservatives, especially from the south
and west, are also potential defectors on several critical issues. They
include Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator David Boren of Oklahoma,
Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama, Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and
Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
Senator Robert Krueger of Texas, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated
by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now the treasury secretary, has also voted against the
administration line, but some political analysts suggest he is trying to
prove his independence before his by-election next month, and may prove more
amenable in future, if he survives.
Republican party loyalty is generally stronger, but a number of centrist
senators, including four from New England, have proved unreliable on
occasion.

Agreement to postpone President Bill Clinton's Dollars 16bn economic
stimulus package allowed the Senate to clear up one critical piece of
legislation that had been held up by the Republican filibuster: a measure to
raise the legal ceiling on US federal debt to Dollars 4,370bn.
The US Treasury, which had been forced to delay debt sales to avoid
breaching the previous ceiling of Dollars 4,145bn, yesterday held a Dollars
14.25bn sale of 52-week bills and announced another Dollars 22.4bn auction
of 13 and 26-week bills for today.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday assured his Egyptian counterpart, Mr Hosni
Mubarak, that the US would take a balanced approach to solving Middle East
problems, Reuter reports from Washington.
At a joint news conference in the White House the US leader offered to be a
'full partner in renewed peace talks. . . I am convinced that we share a
common vision of a more peaceful Middle East.' He believed 'there is reason
to believe we can make real headway.'
The two men had earlier discussed a US proposal for the peace talks to
resume on April 20 in Washington.
Some Arab diplomats have expressed fears that Mr Clinton might soften the
approach followed by former President George Bush, who exerted pressure on
Israel to comply with US wishes.
However, Mr Clinton assured Mr Mubarak that the US would not not tilt
towards Israel, administration officials said.
The Egyptian leader sought to counter the damage that violent incidents by
Moslem fundamentalists have had on his country's tourist trade, declaring
that Egypt was not in danger.
Mr Mubarak also said yesterday that Egypt had 'no definite information' on
the bombing on February 26 of the World Trade Centre in New York. In an
interview published on Monday, he claimed that the Egyptian intelligence
services had supplied the US with general information that might have
prevented the blast.

<TEXT>
THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration yesterday had to abort
its second space shuttle launch in two weeks after a last-minute
malfunction, creating more frustration for an agency struggling to scale its
ambitions and its overheads down to meet budget realities.
The launch of the shuttle Discovery was halted 11 seconds before lift-off
after a warning that a valve had not closed. A fortnight ago, the shuttle
Columbia's engines were shut off just 3 seconds before lift-off.
While the malfunction appeared to be relatively minor - another launch
attempt has been tentatively scheduled for tomorrow - it follows a series of
setbacks to the shuttle programme.
In addition, a faulty launch two weeks ago by General Dynamics' Atlas
Centaur rocket, its third failure in eight attempts, has prompted the
industry magazine Space News to warn of a 'launch crisis on the horizon' if
the government does not start serious work soon on a new launch system.
Nasa's 1994 budget, due to be published tomorrow, is expected to show an
increase of around Dollars 1bn over this year's Dollars 14.3bn. However, the
agency has been ordered by President Bill Clinton to redesign the costly
space station to save money. Administration officials say Nasa has for years
been overambitious.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru claimed yesterday that his closure of
Congress and the courts exactly one year ago had made possible the capture
and conviction of Abimael Guzman, leader of Shining Path, the Maoist
guerrilla movement, AP reports from Lima.
Shining Path itself marked the anniversary by bombing a shopping centre in
Lima's middle class district of San Luis, killing a security guard and
shattering windows. The previous day guerrillas killed 11 members of the
armed forces in the northern Andes.
Mr Fujimori, in a 20-minute television and radio broadcast, said Peru now
presented an image of security for investors after the capture of Guzman and
other high-ranking guerrilla leaders.
'For 10 years Guzman and his followers mocked the state and its
institutions. . . . while the country filled up with its dead,' Mr Fujimori
said. 'But now the most ferocious terrorism in the west is being defeated
without a bloodbath.'
Mr Fujimori said he planned his coup after he realised that a hostile
opposition in Congress and the judiciary were blocking his efforts to combat
terrorism and drug trafficking. He also rejected criticism that he was
authoritarian. 'I like results. Let the others strike poses,' said Mr
Fujimori, who was elected in 1990.

FT  07 APR 93 / Socialist power struggle nears climax in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POWER struggle inside Spain's ruling Socialist party has spilled into the
open, virtually ensuring that a clear defeat or victory will emerge for
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez when the party executive meets on Saturday.
It could force the resignation of Mr Gonzalez as party leader.
Efforts by senior Socialists failed yesterday to paper over cracks caused by
disagreements between the prime minister and Mr Alfonso Guerra, the
left-wing deputy party leader and former deputy prime minister, over charges
that the party illegally financed itself in the late 1980s.
Mr Gonzalez and other conservative members of the cabinet and the party are
pressing for early resignations of senior party personnel in the face of the
scandal, which is hurting the Socialists in advance of elections later this
year. Mr Guerra and the party's chief administrator, Mr Jose Maria Benegas,
deny anyone in the party is to blame.
Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas have released a letter written by Mr Benegas to Mr
Gonzalez last Thursday in which he appeared to offer to resign. In the note,
he accuses members of the government of trying to topple him by blaming him
for the scandal and of breaking the traditions of loyalty and solidarity in
the party. The bitterly worded note was being interpreted more as a call to
arms than a resignation offer.
Supporters of the left-wing party apparatus led by Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas
were yesterday lobbying hard before the Saturday executive meeting. Mr
Gonzalez has made it clear he will be seeking political, rather than legal,
responsibility from the meeting. He has suggested that he will be prepared
to step down as party leader - and thus probably not lead the party in the
next election - if no one else does.
A problem for the prime minister and his supporters is that they do not
command a natural majority on the Socialist executive. Mr Guerra does,
though this is no guarantee that, faced with an election disaster if Mr
Gonzalez goes, the executive would sacrifice Mr Benegas or Mr Guerra.
Tension between the two sides, who accuse each other of destroying the
Spanish economy and the Socialist vote, is now so intense that some senior
party members were speculating that if Mr Gonzalez fails to get his way on
Saturday he will call a quick general election as revenge. The Socialists
would do badly, possibly would not even be able to form a coalition unless
the financing scandal is resolved.

NEGOTIATIONS between Ukraine and Russia over the future of the nuclear
weapons on Ukrainian territory have reached a 'dead end', Ukraine's
President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday.
To resolve the stalemate, he has suggested to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin that the issue be discussed by the Ukrainian and Russian prime
ministers.
Mr Kravchuk rejected Russia's accusation that Ukraine wanted to be a nuclear
power. But he reaffirmed Ukraine's claim to ownership of strategic nuclear
missiles on its territory. An alternative of granting Russia ownership of
the Ukrainian missiles was 'unacceptable' because Ukraine could not permit a
foreign military presence on its soil.
Radiation leaked from a plant in Siberia yesterday after an explosion in a
tank containing uranium, Reuter reports. No casualties were reported in the
incident at the Tomsk-7 complex, one of three facilities in Russia for
processing spent nuclear fuel.

FT  07 APR 93 / Armenia battles on two fronts: Steve LeVine reports on the
heavy burdens of conflict and economic collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS it fights Europe's 'other war', a five-year-old conflict with
neighbouring Azerbaijan, Armenia has begun a politically risky programme to
revive the ex-Soviet Union's worst economy.
The draconian programme, coming during a second winter with no heating,
little electricity and an all but paralysed industry, may be inviting
trouble. Since the Soviet Union broke up a year ago, hostile crowds have
already forced out the neighbouring governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia.
But, says Armenia's 35-year-old prime minister, Mr Hrant Bagratian, 'there
is no other way out. Otherwise, all the population is going to die. We are a
bankrupt country.'
While battling back from the same economic collapse that struck all 15
former Soviet republics after the empire's disintegration, Armenia faces an
enormous additional problem. That is its undeclared war with Azerbaijan, a
territorial dispute that, with some of the same brutality as former
Yugoslavia, shows no sign of ending soon.
Before the conflict, more than 80 per cent of Armenia's natural gas and
other needs were sent through Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has since blockaded
Armenia. Another route, through Georgia, has been interrupted by conflicts
to the north. Efforts to find a Turkish route have been hampered by its long
enmity with Armenia.
The result has been almost a complete shutdown of Armenia's 450 factories.
Homes are lit for just two hours a day, and the sole heat is produced by
wood-burning stoves - tree stumps lining the highway into the capital of
Yerevan testify to the population's desperate quest for warmth.
Not that Armenian shelves are bare. If one has the money, Yerevan's private
farmers' market has the best selection of vegetables and fruit in the
region. A syndicate-run bistro that locals call the 'Mafia Restaurant'
serves patrons grilled beef and sturgeon, brought fresh several times a week
from the Caspian port of Astrakhan. And at the Georgian border, Armenian
black marketeers buy natural gas or petrol from tankers with fuel from
southern Russia, then sell it at a steep mark-up; 20 litres of petrol
costing 4,500 roubles (Pounds 4.70) in Georgia bring 7,000 roubles and more
in Yerevan.
Mr Bagratian's economic programme is meant to normalise Armenia's economy,
and bring fuel and food delicacies to the average home. Armenia possesses
few resources, but does have a well-trained work force. And, though
landlocked, it is well situated, at the crossroads of the Caspian Sea
nations of Iran and Azerbaijan and the Black Sea countries of Turkey and
Georgia. The roads go north to Russia, east to Central Asia and south to the
Gulf. Mr Bagratian's prescription is to reopen factories quickly. The
programme makes no apologies about ignoring Armenian households - Mr
Bagratian admits he is betting that relief over returning to work will
overshadow the continued discomfort of cold and dark days. In five years or
so, when the war may be over, he hopes there will be plenty of light and
heat, as well.
Natural gas shipments of 1.5m cm a day resumed after the pipeline from
Georgia - terrorists had blown it up for the fourth time in a month - was
repaired. One-quarter of daily needs, the gas was enough to reopen 45
factories, or about 15 per cent of industrial capacity, the government says.
The 1993 goal is to restart 55 per cent of industrial capacity.
Comparisons are difficult to avoid between Mr Bagratian and Russia's former
prime minister, the combative Mr Yegor Gaidar. With the support of Russia
President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Gaidar embarked on a tough, ambitious economic
programme that, in addition to antagonising conservative leaders, angered
the public. In December, Mr Yeltsin finally jettisoned his economic pilot.
Mr Bagratian, whose exacting and abrupt style contrasts sharply with
Armenia's usual lax and emotional leadership, confronts at least as
difficult a task as did Mr Gaidar.
In looking to the long term, Armenia has almost concluded an Dollars 57.4m
(Pounds 40.4m) agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to finish a 300 mw oil-and-gas-fired electricity unit at
Harazdan, 25 miles from Yerevan, the government says.
Even when the unit is completed, Mr Bagratian still faces a tremendous
problem ' where will he get fuel to run it?

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will try to conclude a standby agreement with the International
Monetary Fund by October, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, said
yesterday.
While admitting that 'anything could happen', Mr Shokhin claimed that Russia
could conclude a standby deal, setting tough conditions for further IMF
balance of payments of assistance, within the next six months. This would
happen, he suggested, if the central bank and finance ministry pursued
'responsible policies', which would depend on President Boris Yeltsin
receiving appropriate support in a referendum due on April 25.
Mr Shokhin, who concluded Russia's debt rescheduling with western creditor
nations in the Paris Club last week, said the rescheduling could go ahead
even if no standby deal was achieved. He said the Paris Club agreement would
be followed by a similar deal with the London Club of commercial bank
creditors by July. Anticipating the results of the London Club talks, he
said Russia would only have to pay Dollars 3bn to service debts this year,
including Dollars 2bn to the Paris Club, and Dollars 1bn to all other
creditors.
The debt rescheduling deal, although the biggest chunk of assistance granted
so far to Russia, continued to go largely unnoticed in Moscow yesterday.
Like most of the anti-Yeltsin press, a spokesman for the Russian parliament
focused on criticising the Dollars 1.6bn US aid package given to Russia at
the Vancouver summit on Sunday.
'The promised aid of Dollars 1.6bn is of course a noble deed,' Mr Konstantin
Zlobin, said. 'But we know that aid in the form of money handouts usually
disappears into a black hole or gets into the hands of wheeler-dealers who
bank the money in the west.'
In a front page headline, Sovietskaya Rossiya described the Dollars 1.6bn as
'light baggage' and elsewhere accused President Clinton of 'political
madness' in backing President Yeltsin. Like most of the critics which claim
they resent aid, Pravda added that it was far too little, amounting to 'just
Dollars 10.98' per Russian citizen.
The latest meeting of a round table organised by the government and
parliament to try to find solutions to the country's economic problems
showed how elusive a consensus remains. Vice President Alexander Rutskoi,
who is on parliament's side in the conflict with President Yeltsin and the
government, said the young radicals in the government had to be sacked
before agreement was possible.

GIULIO Andreotti picks up a single sheet of paper from the top of his
cluttered desk. 'Yes, this is my avviso di garanzia,' he says with faint
distaste.
The avviso is the notice that this veteran Christian Democrat politician,
seven times prime minister of Italy, is under investigation by Milan
magistrates for alleged illicit financing of a political party. The notice
was served on Monday.
'I heard the news first from television and only received the avviso from
the magistrates myself later in the afternoon,' he adds.
Mr Andreotti, aged 74 and a life senator, is alleged to have asked his old
friend, Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, owner of Roma football team and prominent
financier, to provide L250m (Pounds 114,000) to help the Social Democrat
party (PSDI) in last April's general elections. The small PSDI has long been
one of the two junior partners in the Christian Democrat-led coalition
governments and these funds were not registered in the party's balance
sheet.
'I don't know. I'll have to check,' he says when asked about the incident,
adding vaguely.' I can't remember. It was election time. During elections
you make a lot of telephone calls.' If Mr Andreotti appears to treat this
brush with Milan magistrates as an irritation, he admits to have been deeply
wounded by Palermo magistrates, who want to have his parliamentary immunity
waived to answer the more serious charge of alleged collusion with the
Mafia.
'I feel morally hurt. . . for more then 10 years I have been fighting the
Mafia, adopting tough measures, putting my life at risk.'
Mr Andreotti nevertheless recognises the damage to Italy's international
image as a result of him being linked allegedly to organised crime.
The Palermo magistrates allege that Mr Andreotti, through his close
associate Mr Salvatore Lima, the Sicilian Euro-MP murdered in March 1992,
was the Mafia's point of 'reference' in Rome. The evidence is based on
confessions from pentiti - former Mafiosi co-operating with the judicial
system under plea bargaining programmes. 'None of the pentiti says anything
directly against me. Everything is based on hearsay. No one says Andreotti
helped do this and was found to do that,' he says.
Although Mr Andreotti denies any personal guilt, he is nevertheless willing
to concede for the first time that the political establishment which he has
dominated for so long has a responsibility for failing to tackle earlier the
question of illicit party financing. This was allowed to get out of hand.
But he adds that the cases of personal enrichment through such illicit
funding have been limited. 'Look I live here and not on the moon and the
vast majority of the people I know have the same lifestyles now as before
they entered politics.'
For a man who has seen nearly all his close political and business allies
from the north of Italy and right through Rome and Naples to Sicily caught
up in the corruption scandals, he retains a remarkable posture of normality
in public.
'If I have done something seriously wrong then I am willing to face the
consequences. But I don't believe that to be the case,' he says. The next
step in what is turning into a political trial will be to see how many
friends he has in parliament willing to defend his immunity. The issue has
already created a deep rift inside the party he helped found.

FT  07 APR 93 / E German workers search for voice: Easterners are caught in
a union fight with employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POIGNANT reminder of the tensions underlying the unification of the two
Germanies occured yesterday when Mr Erwin Hein, Saxony's regional head of
Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, resigned.
Mr Hein, an easterner, spent last Sunday afternoon holding talks with Mr
Hasso Duval, a westerner and head of the Saxony branch of IG Metall, the
engineering union, and Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the premier of Saxony. After
several hours of talks in the premier's office in Dresden, they claimed they
had reached a compromise aimed at averting an all-out strike over a pay
dispute among eastern Germany's metal, electrical and steel industry.
But the compromise did not substantially differ from what was agreed between
west German employers, east German managers, and IG Metall in March 1991.
That contract stipulated that east German wages in the metal, electrical and
steel industry would reach west German levels by April 1994. That meant a
pay increase of 26 per cent this year for metal and electrical workers, and
21 per cent rise for the steel sector.
On Sunday, Mr Hein said the employers agreed to pay the 26 per cent rise,
which would bring wages levels to about 82 per cent of western German
levels. In return IG Metall agreed to postpone full wage parity by nine
months.
But Gesamtmetall's headquarters in Cologne said it would stick to its 9 per
cent offer, and added that Mr Biedenkopf had already offered a similar deal
a fortnight ago, which the employers rejected. The failed attempt to break
the deadlock between both sides suggests that IG Metall remains determined
to go ahead with strikes in all three sectors by the end of the month.
However, this failure to seek a compromise underlines the different aims of
the west German employers and unions in east Germany.
Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgebverband Stahl, the steel employers' association,
whose recent decision to exercise their legal right in pulling out of the
1991 contract is one of the reasons for the planned strikes, say they cannot
afford high wages in the east because of the recession.
Their main argument, however, is that western companies will not invest in
the east if labour costs do not reflect productivity levels. Eastern German
wages are about 70 per cent of west German levels, but productivity is 70
per cent below. This means that unit labour costs are about 75 per cent
above west German levels. Estimates show that east Germany's wage bill this
year will exceed the region's gross domestic product of DM201bn (Pounds
85.1bn) by DM47bn.
To counter this argument, IG Metall says migration from east to west Germany
will continue unless skilled workers are paid to remain in the east.
Economists at the Kiel Institute for World Economy, and the Berlin Institute
for Economic Forecasting (DIW), have consistently argued that without pay
restraint in the east, economic recovery will not occur.
Despite repeated warnings about the cost of high wage claims, both sides in
the east German pay dispute now think each has a hidden agenda. IG Metall
believes the employers in the west want to use the east as a means of
breaking collective wage bargaining, first in the east and later in the
west. The employers believe IG Metall is using the east as an attempt to
maintain high wage levels, not only in the five new states, but in west
Germany as well.
Sandwiched between the two sides are 300,000 metal and electrical workers,
and 20,000 steel workers, who so far, have not produced political and
economic elites or leaders capable of articulating the interests of east
Germans.
IG Metall officials yesterday nearly admitted as much. 'The easterners
interests are clear. They do not want to strike. They want job security
first and higher incomes later,' a west German official said.
Yet he added, rather cynically, that if they lose their jobs after getting
their 26 per cent rise, they will at least get higher unemployment benefit.
It is, as one economist said, time for the east Germans to defend their
interests.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has been asked to prepare a report on last week's
suicide of a senior official implicated in EC tobacco fraud.
Members of the European Parliament said yesterday senior Commission
officials had agreed to submit a report to a meeting of the Parliament's
budgetary control committee next month.
MEPs want the report to say how the Commission became aware of alleged fraud
in the tobacco sector in 1990, what they did about it, and whether such
problems could recur.
Mr Antonio Quatraro, an Italian, who was in charge of the EC's tobacco
regime until July 1990, took his own life last week just days before the
final hearings in an internal disciplinary procedure on the alleged fraud.
Mr John Tomlinson, a British Labour MEP and member of the budgetary control
committee, said the disciplinary proceedings centred on allegations that Mr
Quatraro was paid to encourage a cartel of tobacco traders. He allegedly
endorsed the sale of large lots of unwanted Italian and Greek tobacco to the
cartel, which then sold it to developing countries and former Soviet bloc
nations, and benefited from Community export refunds.
Mr Tomlinson and Mr Terry Wynn, another British Labour MEP who follows the
workings of the EC's costly tobacco subsidy regime, said there was nothing
to link Mr Quatraro with the Mafia, as has been alleged in some reports.
Mr Tomlinson said the tobacco case was 'a fairly routine sort of problem'
and the budgetary control committee really wanted to draw attention to the
EC's 'inherently flawed and inherently corrupt' common agricultural policy,
and ensure that the Community closed off opportunities for abuse.
Mr Quatraro was moved from his job at the head of the tobacco regime in July
1990 after a French newspaper reported rumours about fraud in the sector.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday experienced another day of spectacular developments in
corruption scandals with arrests in Milan, Naples and Rome involving more
leading figures in politics and business.
The most prominent political arrest was that of Mr Gaetano Amendola, the
private secretary and economic adviser to Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former
head of the Christian Democrat party.
Mr Forlani himself was advised on Monday that he was under investigation for
alleged receipt of L1.2bn (Pounds 500,000) as a kickback on a roads contract
near Florence. The contract was negotiated through Mr Giovanni Prandini in
1991, when the latter was minister of public works. Yesterday Mr Forlani's
private secretary was arrested on the same charge, while Mr Forlani denied
that he had received any funds. Investigations into illicit payments to
obtain road contracts have now involved all the parties.
Last week it was revealed that Rome and Milan magistrates had prepared a
dossier on Mr Prandini alleging that through Anas, the state roads
authority, he had collected a total of L25bn in kickbacks.
In Milan yesterday, a major development emerged in the two-month inquiry
into Eni, the state oil concern. Magistrates announced six arrest warrants
had been issued for executives in Eni subsidiaries Snam (gas supplies) and
Saipem (pipelines) for alleged falsification of accounts.
The first arrest announced was that of Mr Goffredo Giuliani, deputy chairman
of Metanopoli, the property development company of Snam. The second was of
Mr Carlo Fiore, a board member of Saipem.
Mr Giuliani is also managing director of Snam and has been involved in a big
gas supply deal with Algeria. Milan magistrates are investigating alleged
payments of bribes to foreign intermediaries and political parties on
foreign gas contracts as well as more general use of Eni subsidiaries for
alleged illicit funding of political parties. This has led to the arrest of
four top Eni executives including Mr Gabrieli Cagliari, the chairman.
In Naples magistrates announced a further unravelling of the links between
politicians and businessmen over expenditure related to the 1990 World Cup
football competition, a new mass transit system, the city's public transport
corporation and the main local health authority. For the first time this
involved local politicians of the neo-fascist MSI-DN party which has its
strongest base in Naples. Magistrates issued 19 arrest warrants.

Increased seasonal work cut unemployment in Germany last month to 3.3m,
against almost 3.5m in February, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The
unemployment rate in the west stood at 7.2 per cent in March, down from 7.5
per cent the previous month. In the east, increased activity in the
construction sector led to a slight improvement, though the unemployment
rate was still 15 per cent.
Short-time work continued to rise. Nearly 20,000 more people were on
short-time in the west in March, bringing the total to slightly over 1m. In
the east, employees on short-time work increased by 11,000 to 246,000.

FT  07 APR 93 / Moslems halt UN evacuation of Srebrenica

<TEXT>
LOCAL Moslem authorities yesterday again prevented a United Nations relief
convoy, which reached the besieged eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica with
food and medicines, from evacuating refug ees.
The trucks were turned away empty despite approval for the evacuation from
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, and Moslem leaders in
nearby Tuzla, where thousands of refugees have already been taken.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees officials say they want to evacuate
another 15,000 people from Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to
60,000 after an influx of refugees from surrounding areas occupied by the
Serbs.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, Bosnian military commanders yesterday boycotted a
top level meeting with their Serb and Croat counterparts on the first
anniversary of the siege of Sarajevo, in protest against the continuing Serb
offensive in the Srebrenica region.
General Sefer Halilovic, the commander of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army,
said he could not participate in such a meeting amid 'the unbelievable
continuation of the aggression in Srebrenica'.
However, delegations from the Bosnian Croatian Defence Force, the Bosnian
Serb Army, the rump Yugoslav army and the Croatian army all turned up as
promised and the meeting went ahead without the top Moslem commanders. But
General Ratko Mladic, the top Bosnian Serb commander, did not personally
attend.
UN officials have billed the talks as a vital step towards an overall
settlement of the Bosnian conflict on the basis of the peace plan drawn up
by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen, the international mediators.
However, Gen Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, played
down the significance of the meeting. He said the problem of Srebrenica was
the most important item on the agenda of yesterday's talks.
There were more promising developments in Geneva, where Croatia and rebel
Serbs from the self-styled Serbian republic of Krajina, signed a ceasefire
accord yesterday ending two months of conflict in the disputed Krajina
enclave.
But Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, the 'foreign minister' of Krajina, said the
agreement would not come into effect unless Serb deputies approved it at a
special session next Saturday.
Under the agreement, Croatian forces would withdraw behind a 1992 ceasefire
line, which they overran in January to reclaim positions they claim as vital
to the Croatian economy.
The Serbs, for their part, would return heavy weapons to UN control, and
ethnically mixed 'pink zones', previously policed by the Serbs, would also
be placed under the control of the UN Protection Force.
In Rome, Italy said it would take command of an international patrol on the
River Danube to prevent oil and other strategic goods from reaching Serbia.

FT  07 APR 93 / Labour strategy aims to stem industrial decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING pension funds and building societies to channel personal savings
into industry as well as property is one of the key proposals in a
consultation paper on industrial strategy launched by the Labour party
yesterday.
Labour said that only a complete overhaul of British business practice could
reverse the decline in the UK's manufacturing industry. The party wants to
discuss with the pensions industry and building societies how their current
legal position and investment practices might be altered to allow them to
invest in the UK's productive capacity.
The overall aim of the plans in the paper, Making Britain's Future, is to
develop a longer-term approach to investment, in contrast to what Labour
sees as the 'short-termism' of the City and the pursuit of growth through
acquisition. Its other suggestions include tax incentives for companies;
reform of takeover law to bring greater stability; and representation of
employees on company boards.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, emphasised that there would be thorough
consultation over the coming months as the document was discussed with
business, industry, professional associations and trades unions.
'Our aim is to reach the maximum consensus on the most successful way
forward for British industry,' he said. The post-consultation version will
be presented to the party conference in 1994, and will form the basis of
Labour's industrial policy at the next election.
While the paper includes some familiar Labour proposals, such as a training
levy on companies which do not invest in skills, it also shows a shift in
mood. The emphasis is on allowing and encouraging change rather than
legislating to enforce it. The paper condemns the Tories for lack of
commitment to manufacturing, and Mr Smith expressed scepticism at recent
ministerial pronouncements that the economic recovery was under way. 'The
test that we will be applying is: does unemployment come down?' he said.
Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister, dismissed Labour's programme
as a repackaging of the 'meddling and muddling' that had failed when the
party was last in government.
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry,
welcomed the prospect of discussion of Labour's plans but warned there was
no reason to think that ideas previously unacceptable to British business,
such as employee directors, would be well-received now.

FT  07 APR 93 / Shell unveils Pounds 1.3bn plan to extend life of Brent
field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABERDEEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESERVES of the UK's biggest oil and gas field will be significantly
boosted by a Pounds 1.3bn engineering project on a scale never carried out
before anywhere in the world.
Shell UK yesterday unveiled a five-year scheme which will extend the
productive life of the Brent field in the North Sea by more than 10 years.
It will add the equivalent of a medium-sized gas field and a small oilfield
to the UK's hydrocarbon reserves.
The project accords with the government's desire to see oil companies
extract more oil and gas from existing fields. To encourage this, it
announced in last month's Budget the lowering of petroleum revenue tax and a
sharp cut in tax allowances for new oilfield exploration.
Mr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell UK Exploration and Production, said
in Aberdeen that the project had been planned over the past three years and
he had been 'as surprised as everyone else by the Budget changes'. Although
the Brent project would benefit from the changes, their overall effect on
Shell Expro's North Sea operation was 'basically neutral'.
The UK's oil production from the North Sea peaked in 1986, but oil companies
expect it to continue well into the next century. The Brent project, which
could be emulated in other fields, will further prolong it.
The project, which received Department of Trade and Industry approval
yesterday, involves progressively lowering the pressure in the field to
release large quantities of gas and some oil which are currently
unrecoverable. This will be achieved by modifications to the platforms.
The Brent field, off Shetland, is the biggest producing both oil and gas in
the North Sea. It produces 13 per cent of the UK's oil and 10 per cent of
its gas, but its oil production peaked in 1985 and some 73 per cent of the
recoverable oil has been produced.
The new project should extend its life from the originally projected
run-down date of 1998 to about 2010. It will add 34m barrels of oil to
Brent's recoverable reserves, bringing them to 1.976bn barrels, and will
boost the field's recoverable reserves of gas by 1.5 trillion cubic feet,
bringing them to 5.5 trillion cu ft.
When the field is abandoned, about 55 per cent of its oil and 80 per cent of
its gas will have been recovered. From the turn of the century, gas will be
the dominant production from the field, greatly simplifying production and
reducing operating costs.
Shell Expro, which operates the field on behalf of a 50-50 joint venture of
Shell and Esso, said gas was currently locked into the oil by the high
pressure at which the field is operated. 'When the pressure is lowered, the
gas comes out of the solution.'
The Brent field will remain in production while the work is carried out,
with one platform being shut down at a time, reducing output. Facilities in
three of the four platforms will be modified or replaced to permit
depressurisation and to handle the increased quantities of gas. All four
platforms will be upgraded and refurbished.

<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's biggest industrial group, is heading for a further
fall in profits of between 25 and 30 per cent this year, Mr Gerhard Liener,
finance director, said yesterday.
The group expects to cut 15,000 jobs in 1993, following the loss of 18,000
jobs last year, and production plans have been pruned.
'The German economy's nose-dive has been picking up speed at a rate that has
surprised even hardened pessimists,' said Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman.
The slowdown was set to continue, he added. 'In other words, we must face up
to the fact that 1993 is going to be even harder than the second half of
1992.'
Net earnings would be driven down to about DM1bn (Pounds 410m), compared
with DM1.45bn in 1992, Mr Liener said. In the first quarter, earnings would
be considerably lower than the DM480m for the same period last year.
Mr Reuter said group sales in the first quarter had already fallen 25 per
cent, compared with the same period last year. The decline was due
exclusively to a steep reduction in vehicle sales.
Plans for car production had been cut by 43,000 to 486,000 units, he said.
Commercial vehicle output would fall 27,000 to about 250,000.
Mercedes-Benz, the vehicles subsidiary which usually accounts for two-thirds
of group sales and in 1991 provided 80 per cent of earnings, has been
especially hard hit by the domestic recession.
The division's earnings last year dropped almost 60 per cent to DM849m on
marginally reduced turnover of DM66.48bn.
Daimler, which also includes the Dasa aerospace business, AEG electrical and
electronic engineering, and the Debis software and financial services
division, had shown encouraging growth in the first half of 1992, Mr Liener
said.
But then it tumbled into 'acute losses' which were cushioned only by the
first full consolidation of the Airbus aircraft business, which last year
earned DM411m net.
Dasa, which last year turned in a DM341m loss, including a DM500m provision
for staff cuts, is expected to show a considerable improvement this year, Mr
Liener said.
AEG, which in 1992 earned just DM10m after DM624m losses in the previous
year, would probably slip back into the red. However, Mr Liener expected a
speedy return to profit as restructuring took effect.
Despite the sharp drop in group sales so far, Mr Reuter said he expected
turnover for the full year more or less to match 1992's DM98.5bn, but
stressed that trends were hard to forecast.

FT  07 APR 93 / US female auditors more moral than men, says study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN IN US accountancy firms are more moral than their male counterparts
but are less likely to reach senior positions which would allow them to
influence the conduct of their firms, an academic study suggested yesterday.
Female auditors in five of the six largest US accountancy firms were
significantly more moral than men and were likely to make more ethical
decisions as a result, two American academics told the annual academic
conference of the British Accounting Association in Glasgow.
The academics measured moral judgment by using tests which assessed the
employees' responses to a series of fictional ethical accounting and
auditing problems.
Women in UK accounting firms and industry were sceptical about the claims
yesterday. Ms Yve Newbold, Hanson company secretary, said women were
undoubtedly more ethical 'but it doesn't follow that if you cheat you're
more likely to get to the top'. Perhaps male and female influences were
needed in business - 'the robust, creative accountants, and also the more
ethical, cautious approach'.
Mr Richard Bernardi of the State University of New York and Mr Donald Arnold
of Union College analysed data gathered from psychological tests on 494
managers and seniors in accountancy firms.
Mr Arnold said the women were more likely to be sensitive to signs of fraud
and 'red flags' or problems thrown up by audits. He said they were more
likely to blow the whistle to regulators when irregularities were
discovered, and to interpret professional ethical codes of conduct by the
spirit rather than simply the letter.
Mr Bernardi warned that accountancy firms ran the risk of becoming less
moral over time, because predominantly male partners with low moral values
tended to promote like-minded individuals.
He said the solution would be to either increase the promotion prospects for
women into more senior positions, or to increase the retention by the firms
of more moral male employees from the lower ranks.
Ms Emma Lubbock, who has been a partner with Price Waterhouse for seven
years, agreed yesterday that there were differences in the ways men and
women worked, but said she had never seen any difference in ethical
standards. Women tended to be less interested in office politics and more
geared to results, she said.
Ms Sheila Masters, a senior partner with KPMG, said she found the results of
the research 'incredible'. There were no observable differences in the way
men and women did their jobs. While there were few women currently at the
top in accountancy, a new generation was coming through, she said.
At the conference, Mr Bernardi called on accountancy firms to review hiring,
evaluation, retention and promotion policies to assess any unwanted bias
that existed in their organisations.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric production to be
cut as demand falls
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OKI Electric, the Japanese telecommunications and data processing company,
is closing a plant in Tokyo and reducing activities at two other plants.
The decision to close the plants, which manufacture control and information
communication equipment and semiconductors, follows a severe downturn in
capital investment by Japanese companies.
Oki has been hit by a fall in orders for information communication systems
from financial companies and a downturn in semiconductor demand.
The company is forecasting a fall in sales to Y560bn (Dollars 4.7bn) in the
year to the end of March 1993, down from a previous forecast of Y585bn.
It is also predicting pre-tax losses of Y39bn, against its earlier forecast
of Y1.28bn profits.
It expects to cut capital spending to Y47.7bn in the year to March and to
Y20bn in fiscal 1994, compared with Y68.4bn in the year to March 1992.
Oki has been restructuring its businesses, cutting recruitment from 1,000
last year to just over 400 this year and about 100 next.
It hopes to reduce its workforce by 2,000 by 1995.
Kenwood, the Japanese audio manufacturer, revised down its forecast net
result by Y7.5bn for the year to March 1993 and now expects to report an
after-tax losses of Y5.5bn, compared with a previous forecast of Y2bn
profit.
The expected deficit comes after an extraordinary deficit comprising
currency losses incurred through the sale of shares in a US subsidiary,
writing off losses from selling securities, and unrecoverable loans made to
a struggling financial subsidiary.
The company expects to report a pre-tax profits of Y4bn, down from Y6.1bn
the year before.

NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications group, expects further orders once a
new DCS 1800 cellular phone network expands in Germany, Reuter reports from
Helsinki.
Mr Jorma Ollila, president and chief executive, said: 'We believe the order
may bring significant orders in the future.' The company will begin
discussions of further orders within the next few months.
Nokia said it had won an order worth more than DM150m (Dollars 90m) to
deliver phones and infrastructure for the first phase of a new, Germany-wide
personal communications network to E-Plus, a German digital cellular
operator.
Hugo Boss, the menswear group, said it expected 1993 net profit to be lower
than the previous year, Reuter reports from Metzingen.
'We will certainly not reach the record result from 1992,' Mr Peter Littman,
the management board chairman, said yesterday.
Boss net profit rose to DM44.2m (Dollars 26.6m) in 1992 from DM35.4 m a year
earlier.
Adidas, the German sports goods group, has confirmed it made a loss of
DM149m (Dollars 89.7m) in 1992 after a profit of DM15m the year before,
Reuter reports from Herzogenaurach.

Pay increases for Japanese office workers this year were the lowest since
1987, a private survey revealed yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The rises for the fiscal year starting April 1 averaged 3.83 per cent, said
the survey conducted by the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations.
It said the average monthly salary increase of Y10,767 (Dollars 94) was
Y2,562 less than in the previous year.
The survey was based on questionnaires sent to 326 large companies, 76 per
cent of which responded, Nikkeiren said.
The highest rise among industries polled was the hotel sector, which
registered a 4.8 per cent or Y11,853 increase, while wages for workers in
the steel industry rose by 2.64 per cent or Y7,500, it said.

FT  06 APR 93 / China in bid to tackle its Aids problem: The government
realised the disease would cause serious social and economic trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DARKNESS has fallen on Beijing and a chill wind is slicing across the city.
Most people have scuttled indoors, but in Beijing's Dongdan park a Chinese
Aids campaigner is pursuing a lonely crusade.
Mr Wan, an official of China's National Health Institute, is accosting
homosexuals who frequent the park to advise them of the dangers of
unprotected sex.
The young Chinese health worker finds a receptive, albeit wary, audience.
As Mr Wan observes ruefully: 'In 1985, a public health official wrote an
article in which he stated there were no homosexuals and no intravenous drug
users in China. But actually we can say that everything happens in China.'
Mr Wan fears that grudging official acceptance of the dangers of the spread
of Aids among high-risk groups such as homosexuals, prostitutes and
intravenous drug users will delay action needed urgently to educate the
public.
'I worry that if we don't tackle the problem there may be an Aids explosion
in China in 5-10 years' time,' he says.
According to official Chinese statistics a mere 969 HIV positive cases had
been reported to the ministry of public health by the end of last year, but
this almost certainly understates the problem. Mr Wan believes that numbers
infected may well exceed 100,000, and could run into millions fairly soon.
Mr Wan is also worried about the spread of Aids among prostitutes, now that
the world's oldest profession is being practised fairly freely on the
streets, and in the bars and discos of Chinese cities.
Indeed, Mr Wan journeyed to a city disco where he tried to convey the
message to prostitutes. His reception was not all that encouraging, with one
young woman insisting that 'Aids is very far from Beijing.'
Mr Wan has instituted anonymous Aids discussion groups and Aids 'hotlines'
which are now operating in five Chinese cities. Volunteers counsel callers
who fear they may have contracted the disease.
A big problem in China, however, for the health authorities in their efforts
to encourage Chinese to have voluntary Aids test is a fear confidentiality
will not be respected.
Mr Wan is surprisingly outspoken in his criticism of what he perceives as a
slack official response to the Aids challenge. The health ministry's
approach is to tell people not to have sex, they don't tell them how to have
safe sex, he says.
Dr Li Jingwu of the Department of Epidemic Prevention at the health ministry
exhibited what might be regarded as a fairly unsympathetic view. 'We have
many ways to control the problems of prostitution and homosexuality - we can
lock them all up, can't we,' he said in an interview.
'Just let the foreign human rights groups denounce us, so long as we are
preventing these people from further spreading this dangerous thing.'
Dr Li said that, in any case, his ministry was much more concerned about the
possible spread of HIV by way of contaminated needles used in rural clinics
where cost and sheer weight of numbers have meant that many patients are
obliged to share needles.
The health ministry official also expressed concern about the Aids threat in
China's southern Yunnan province which adjoins the 'Golden Triangle' of
Burma, Laos and Thailand. Some 300,000 Yunnanese are estimated to be drug
addicts.
Dr Li also rejected Mr Wan's criticism that not nearly enough was being done
to educate people about the spread of Aids in the world's most populous
country. The government, he said, spent Dollars 4m on Aids education in 1992
and had stepped up its counselling efforts among high-risk groups.
'I think the government has realised that sooner or later Aids would cause
serious social and economic trouble if we don't take drastic measures now.'

He was quoted as saying that Korea would supply half the equipment and
technology.
The main investment would be in a car plant, but Daewoo also planned to help
finance factories to assemble South Korean video and audio equipment, Mr Kim
said.
The cars and other equipment would be sold mainly in Tatarstan - an
autonomous republic within Russia - in Russia itself, and in other members
of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday signed a Pounds
65m concessional loan to Indonesia to fund a 65MW power station to be built
by a UK company in Samarinda, East Kalimantan.
The contract for the project has not been awarded but, under the terms of
the loan, it must go to a British company. Mr Hurd rebutted suggestions
that, by tying the aid, the UK government was undermining the principle of
free trade.
British exports to Indonesia grew 58 per cent to Pounds 312m last year,
while Indonesian exports to the UK rose 29 per cent to Pounds 536m.
'Of the substantial exports markets for Britain, last year Indonesia grew
faster than any other to the UK,' Mr Hurd said.
Officials say the loan is a belated effort to promote UK companies in an
Indonesian sector in which Dollars 30bn of new investment is planned in the
1990s.
Indonesia hopes one-third of the investment will be by private companies
which will build, own and operate power stations linked directly to the
national grid.
Mission Energy of the US is expected to resume negotiations later this month
for two 600MW units, worth Dollars 2bn, of the Paiton private power project.
Industry officials say British Gas is considering investing in private power
schemes, possibly taking a stake in a proposed 400MW, Dollars 450m station
in Serpong, West Java.

FT  06 APR 93 / Turkey calls for UN support in Armenia conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY yesterday sought the support of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council for a draft resolution calling on Armenia to
withdraw from territory taken in recent fighting with Azerbaijan.
Turkey has hitherto tried to take an even-handed approach to the conflict
between neighbouring Christian Armenia and Azerbaijan, a fellow Moslem state
with which it has growing links.
However in a move marking a hardening of its position, Ankara yesterday
announced it was banning all flights to Armenia which passed through its
airspace. Diplomats in Ankara said the worsening conflict seemed certain to
derail peace talks in Rome under the auspices of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe.
The latest fighting, with Armenian forces seizing the strategic town of
Kelbejer over the weekend, has intensified domestic pressure on the
government to move to contain what is seen by Ankara as Armenian aggression.
However rather than acting unilaterally, diplomats say Turkey is seeking UN
support to end the attacks on 'Azerbaijan's territorial integrity'.
Clashes were reported again yesterday along the Azeri border close to the
disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, which is populated by ethnic
Armenians. Recent Armenian gains have further opened up the strategic Lachin
corridor linking Armenia with Karabakh.
Azerbaijan said yesterday that its forces had repelled a Armenian attack on
the key southern town of Fizuli.
Local officials said the Armenian forces were now three miles outside
Fizuli, which lies in a narrow strip of Azeri territory separating
Nagorno-Karabakh from Iran.
Capturing Fizuli would have cemented gains made by Karabakh Armenian forces
in a recent offensive and would have brought all of south-western Azerbaijan
under Armenian control.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry yesterday called in ambassadors of the
permanent five to urge immediate UN condemnation of the Armenian offensive
which Azeri officials claim has resulted in the loss of 10 per cent of its
territory. Armenia claims the latest operation was in response to continual
Azeri artillery attack on villages in the disputed enclave.
After pressure from both France and the US, countries with large diaspora
Armenian communities, Turkey braved domestic criticism to open its rail link
with Armenia via Dogu Kapi. Last week, however, Turkey halted all aid
convoys to Armenia.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, warned Turkey's patience was
running out. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said policy was under
'hourly review'.

THE Polish government's latest attempt to persuade parliament to accept a
modified mass privatisation plan is taking place against the background of
an increasingly complex response to the issues involved.
A banner draped across a wall at the Goradze cement works near Opole catches
the mood in many factories. 'We say No to a majority share for foreign
capital,' it reads. Inside the plant Mr Andrzej Balcerak, the managing
director, finds himself caught between the Privatisation Ministry, which
wants to sell his factory, and the Belgian cement producer, CBR, which wants
to buy.
Mr Balcerak says he no longer notices the banner put up by the unions last
autumn. But he admits to understanding the union's concern over the future
of this relatively modern, profitable plant which is running at full
capacity of 2m tonnes a year.
'A major effort has been made over the past two years by management and
workers to bring the plant up to scratch,' he says. 'So the questions arise
 -why sell, and if so, who should reap the benefit?'.
A compromise being hammered out, with the International Finance Corporation
advising the government, will probably see the Belgian company take a
minority share, leaving a significant part of the equity for management and
employees.
Mr Balcerak will be relieved when it happens as he recognises that the plant
needs an owner. But the drawn-out process, which has lasted for over a year,
is becoming typical of most privatisations in Poland.
Dr Bernd Venohr from Bain and Co, the consultants who sold the Pollena
Bydgoszcz detergents plant to Unilever in four months in 1991 but took
another year to sell the Pollena soap factory in Wroclaw to Cusson's last
month, confirms the process is taking longer.
'This time we put most of our effort into negotiating with the employees at
Pollena Wroclaw, going back and forth between the unions and the investor
and doing a lot of talking to the employees calming their fears about their
future.' Dr Venohr likens the process to a takeover negotiation with the
shareholders of a company rather than its employees. 'But that's the way it
has to be if sales are to come off,' he says.
Around one-third of respondents in opinion polls accept privatisation as
beneficial. But when it comes down to the fate of a specific plant
resistance grows, largely because of fear of unemployment.
A recent study showed that 51 per cent of state sector industrial workers
wanted their enterprises to stay in state hands while a further 25 per cent
thought their plant should be owned by the workers. Only 11 per cent thought
it should be bought by fellow Poles while a mere 3 per cent thought it
should belong to a foreign company.
Mr Balcerak underlines that resistance is greater in profitable plants,
which are most attractive to investors, while employees of factories on the
verge of collapse, and therefore least attractive to potential investors,
are the most amenable to investors of all stripes.
The government's Mass Privatisation Scheme, with its plan to hand over some
600 state sector enterprises to foreign-managed National Investment Funds
(NIF), represents the government's attempts to address some of these
problems.
The plants selected for the scheme by the privatisation ministry headed by
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, are mainly medium-sized and profitable. As such they
are unlike the bulk of companies privatised to date. Most of the 800 or so
employee and management buy-outs thus far have been mainly small enterprises
and service industries while most foreign investors have been multinationals
which have bought strategically into sectors such as food processing, paper
and pulp, tobacco, detergents and power engineering where plants tend to be
big and capital-intensive.

FT  06 APR 93 / Hoechst steps in over plant accidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST said yesterday that its management board was assuming joint
responsibility for plant safety and environmental protection, taking over
the task from Mr Karl Holoubek, the board member who to date has handled it
on his own.
The move follows a string of accidents at the chemical group. This led to
the call by Mr Joshka Fischer, environment minister in the state of Hesse,
for Mr Holoubek to step aside until a thorough investigation of safety
systems could prove that a recent series of accidents at company facilities
were not caused by mismanagement.
The company, which is based in Hesse, said yesterday that the measure would
be in force while the investigation was being carried out. It declined to
say whether Mr Holoubek had been relieved of this task as a result of the
decision.
Hoechst said the investigation would prove that its security systems were of
a high standard. It is reviewing safety measures at its 123 plants.
Last Friday a broken pipe at its main plant near Frankfurt sent several
hundred kilograms of concentrated sulphuric acid into the atmosphere.
The most serious accident, on March 15, killed one worker and left another
seriously injured after an explosion.

<TEXT>
Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries fell sharply for the
second consecutive trading day as analysts digested US price war
implications.
The stock lost 42 1/2 to 885p on continuing heavy turnover of 8.2m shares as
SG Warburg, traditionally bears of the company, reiterated its negative
stance.
Analysts said the full impact of the Philip Morris announcement on Friday,
of swingeing cuts in the price of its Marlboro brand, was diluted in the UK
because it arrived late and because the rail strike kept many institutional
investors away from work. Also, in the US, many experts were attending an
RJR Nabisco annual meeting. Rothmans International 'B' shares fell 21 to
636p in sympathy.
Rearguard support helped Wellcome shares regain 13 to 705p against a weak
market. Pharmaceuticals experts argued that following Friday's announcement
that many early stage HIV positive people would not receive benefits from
taking Wellcome's anti-Aids drug, much of the media coverage was overblown.
Mr Franc Gregori of Robert Fleming Securities reduced his 1994 profits
forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 790m, but said Friday's wave of heavy
selling reinforced Wellcome's position as 'our favoured stock within a very
oversold drug sector'. In an internal note, Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure
Gordon said: 'The data published so far is seriously misleading.'
A series of downgrades followed meetings between Unilever and food
manufacturing analysts, sending shares in the Anglo-Dutch food group into
retreat. Most of the changes in analysts' figures represented currency
movements, although concern over the weakness in European sales was also
mentioned. Most still retained their fundamentally positive view on the
stock, although the negative sentiment knocked the shares 26 to 1163p.
Dalgety shares were upset by weekend press comment, although food
manufacturing specialists declared that most of the worries over the
insurance dispute with Inchcape was thought to be in the price. The shares
fell back 14 to 452p. Inchcape lost 5 to 585p.
Food retailers remained under a cloud as analysts waited for what are seen
as extremely important results from Tesco today. A price-led fightback by
the supermarket chain would cast an even larger pall over the sector,
according to retailing specialists.
A chink of light was provided by Henderson Crosthwaite, which produced a
weighty tome on the sector, largely dismissing worries over the likely
effect of discounting food groups and asserting that the majors still have
room for earnings growth. The house particularly likes Argyll Group, off 4
at 337p, Asda, 1 1/2 shy at 67p, and J. Sainsbury, 9 adrift at 478p.
Stores proved a brighter spot, with selected retailers basking in the
recovery story and some recent positive results. Among these, Great
Universal Stores added 5 at 1618p, Kingfisher 3 at 592p and WH Smith 2 at
418p.
Electricity shares were buoyant, largely on yield considerations, although
dealers pointed out that turnover was low. Eastern was particularly strong,
helped by a buy note and upgrade from SG Warburg. The broker attributes its
positive stance to 'stringent cost control' which offers 'scope for enhanced
dividend growth and removing any lingering investor concern regarding
relative dividend prospects after the 1994-95 regulatory review'. The shares
moved ahead 8 to 480p.
Among water stocks, Southern was the best performer, climbing 5 to 548p.
A press report that cable television was taking business from BT at the rate
of 15,000 customers a month came as little surprise to the market and the
shares drifted in a lacklustre telecoms sector, closing 6 down at 434p.
The leisure sector continued to fret over the demise of Queens Moat Houses.
Resort Hotels lost 4 to 36p, while the sector leader Forte shed 5 to 179p.
Speculation that the latter will announce a dividend cut with its results
next week continues to gather support among leisure specialists.
The Grand National was also occupying analysts' minds with suggestions that
Saturday's fiasco might require downgrades dismissed. Talk of a loss in
revenue of up to Pounds 2m for Ladbroke Group as a result of the race's
cancellation were also wide of the mark, market sources said. Ladbroke
tumbled 10 at the market's opening, in line with other gambling groups, but
later recovered to close just 4 off at 172p. Bass, owner of Coral, rallied
to finish a penny off at 550p, while Brent Walker was a halfpenny lower at
12p.
Concern about the passenger yield at British Airways also had an impact on
BAA, which left the shares 9 lighter at 800p.

High Street bank Barclays, which is exposed to troubled hotels group Queens
Moat Houses, was under increased pressure yesterday as Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken
published a severe sell recommendation.
Carr's banking analyst Mr Derek Chambers said that since the bank's massive
rights issue in 1988 it has seen its market share fall by between 15 and 20
per cent. He added that even though it needs a higher capital ratio, 'it is
difficult to see how the bank. . . can achieve this without another rights
issue.' Barclays retreated 10 to 405p.

The market liked the confident statement from Mirror Group enough to
discount the company's 1992 pre-tax loss of Pounds 84m. The newspaper
group's shares rose 11 to 115p on heavy turnover of 10m.
Analysts had anticipated the heavy exceptional charge and turned their
attention to the rise in operational profits. They were also heartened by
improvement in advertising revenues. Ms Lorna Tilbian of SG Warburg
increased her 1993 forecast by 50 per cent to Pounds 60.9m and said:
'Despite the recent rise in the share price, the fundamentals have improved
sufficiently to enable us to maintain a buy recommendation.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FLAG carrier British Airways fell sharply as a number of securities
houses, including the company's broker, lowered profits forecasts. One
analyst is believed to have reduced his prediction by a third. The shares
were also depressed by worries over passenger yield.
The initial decline came when the shares were marked lower to take account
of the 7.54p final dividend, brought forward by the company to beat tax
changes announced in the Budget last month.
However, dealers then became concerned about passenger yield figures ahead
of the release of traffic data for March. Although these revealed an 11.8
per cent increase on a year ago, in line with market expectations, the
airline confirmed that passenger yields remained under pressure, prompting
heavy selling of the shares.
UBS, the company's broker, downgraded its current year profits prediction by
around Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m, which still leaves it at the top of the
market range. Another leading securities house was said to have cut its
figure by Pounds 100m to Pounds 200m.
The market was also concerned about the possibility of a price war on both
BA's European and Atlantic routes. The shares lost 12 1/2 at 275p xd, with
turnover rising to 5.7m.

FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities suffer from Wall Street
blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL-OUT from Wall Street's 68-point Dow slide last Friday ensured
another dismal performance by London's equity market yesterday. The FT-SE
100 Index ended a disappointingly slow session, the last of the financial
year, a net 31.1 lower at 2,838.8, its third successive decline. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index performed slightly better, ending 17.7 down at 3,090.8.
But worries that Wall Street could have been heading for further substantial
pressure yesterday proved unfounded when the US market opened some eight
points higher before slipping away later in the session.
Taking its cue from Wall Street, which had plummeted on news of an imminent
tobacco price war and a worrying fall in US bond prices, the Footsie opened
more than 23 points lower. Much of the early pressure was triggered by the
futures market, although dealers noted that activity in that area was
relatively thin.
An early attempt at a rally saw the Footsie claw back some early weakness,
reaching what turned out to be the day's best level, down 14.8, within an
hour of the opening.
Thereafter, share prices did little more than drift easier in extremely
subdued trading. Even the better than expected showing by Wall Street failed
to shake London from its torpor. At its worst, shortly after Wall Street
began trading, the Footsie was down 34.8.
Turnover yesterday was a disappointing 437m shares, one of the lowest levels
since the turn of the year and almost certain to drive the value of customer
business below the Pounds 1bn mark. The value of customer business in the
market last Friday, in spite of the effect of the railway strike, was a
healthy Pounds 1.47bn.
Dealers said yesterday's fall in the FT-SE 100 was slightly misleading. 'The
market does not feel under too much pressure,' commented one leading
marketmaker.
Another remarked that yesterday was one of the quietest trading sessions
this year. He also pointed out that today's Jewish Passover holiday would
affect the level of business in the market for the next couple of days.
Bank lending and money supply data, released in mid-morning, was said to
have been in line with expectations and had little effect in the market.
Gilts dipped around  1/4 at the long end, while index-linked were  1/16
easier.
BAT Industries shares continued to slide, with analysts reducing profits
estimates after last Friday's shock news that Philip Morris is launching a
substantial price-cutting initiative. The banking sector was looking
vulnerable after last week's suspension of Queens Moat Houses, with Barclays
notably weak following a bearish note issued by stockbroker Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken. Shares in the UK's leading bookmakers fell across the board after
Saturday's Grand National fiasco.
Only 10 Footsie stocks managed to close in positive territory, with
Wellcome, devasted last week by worries over its anti-Aids drug Retrovir,
staging a good rally. Mirror Group was an outstanding performer, with the
market more than pleased with the outlook for the newspaper group.
A handful of leading UK retailers recorded modest rises on the session,
while Pilkington and Hepworth moved up as the market responded to
speculation that MB Caradon could be about to launch a sizeable bid in the
building sector.

FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY selling of stock index futures led to a decline in the June FT-SE 100
contract as dealers focused on Friday's heavy falls on Wall Street, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In spite of the decline, the biggest part of which came after the market
close in London, trading in the June contract opened firmly on buying from
independent traders.
However, the buying had dried up by mid-morning, which then left June to
drift down as dealers feared further falls in New York.
By early afternoon, the contract had fallen to its fair value premium to
cash of about 11 points, an opportunity which many traders used to arbitrage
between the futures and the cash market - leading to increased turnover in
the contract. However, the anticipated further fall on Wall Street did not
materialise, which led to sporadic buying before the close.
The June contract finished at 2,855, down 17 from Friday's close and around
7 points above its fair value premium to cash, with turnover a reasonable
9,000 contracts.
The volume in the traded options was poor, reaching only 23,898 contracts by
the close. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,794 lots traded, although there was
little business in the Euro FT-SE 100 version, with a mere 753 dealt.
Lasmo was the most active stock option, seeing 2,012 contracts traded,
followed by Forte, with 1,106 lots.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses see activity in
automotive stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR GOOD or ill, automotive industry stocks attracted their fair share of
atttention in senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was mixed in quiet, pre-holiday trade, the DAX index ending 3.06
lower at 1,658.69 as German equity turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM4.7bn.
Automotive stocks saw much of the action. Daimler-Benz and Mercedes
reflected Friday's afternoon quotations, heading the active stocks list in
turnover of DM1bn, and DM550m respectively. Daimler fell DM15.50 to DM595
over the official session and Mercedes, which owns 25.2 per cent of Daimler,
rose DM84 to DM574 on Friday's news that Mercedes shares will be swapped
into Daimler on a one-for-one basis.
Porsche lost nearly 3 per cent after its recent gains, falling DM15 to DM518
on a combination of profit-taking and weekend comment. Meanwhile, there was
another burst of afternoon news at Continental, the tyremaker, where
Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca are leading the placing of the Pirelli holding,
and where Pirelli claimed a price of DM250 a share.
Conti responded in the after-hours, Ibis market with a price of DM213
compared with its official close of DM204.20, down DM3.30. It came back a
little later, but only to DM210.
MILAN was lifted by a firm performance by telecommunications shares but
otherwise, investors remained hesitant amid the political uncertainty in the
run-up to the electoral reform referendum on April 18. The Comit index rose
3.22 to 478.66.
Sip ordinary shares added L60 or 4 per cent to L1,541 in volume of 8.29m
shares after ministers agreed a plan to merge it, with the country's other
telephone companies, into a single group.
Italcable, the intercontinental operator, gained L20 to L5,230.
Pirelli, L18 ahead at one stage, finished L11 lower at L1,339 ahead of the
announcement of the sale of its holdings in Continental, the German type
maker.
'We view this development as being very positive for Pirelli since it will
produce L140bn in capital gains which can be counted into the 1993 results,'
said Mr John Stewart of Pastorino and Partners in Milan. 'It is also a sign
that Pirelli is going ahead with its debt reduction programme. This deal
will produce much welcomed cash.'
PARIS combined caution, ahead of any major policy statements by the new
centre-right government, with worries about results due this week from a
number of major companies. This left the CAC-40 index down 16.14 at 1,974.68
in turnover of about FFr1.9bn against Friday's FFr3bn.
Automotive stocks were weak. Michelin fell FFr5.30 to FFr165.70 ahead of
tomorrow's results, following a sell recommendation from a domestic broker.
Peugeot lost FFr16 at FFr548 in the wake of last Friday's disappointing
French new car sales for March.
Credit Lyonnais certificates , meanwhile, were FFr16 lower at FFr617 on a
report indicating problems with the purchase of a profitable bond portfolio;
Pechiney certificates fell FFr4.90 to FFr297.10 ahead of results due today.
AMSTERDAM edged lower in quiet trading and the CBS Tendency index finished
0.10 lower at 106.70.
Aegon, down Fl 2.30 at Fl 83.60, continued to be hurt by last week's news
that shareholders have to choose between a cash or stock dividend before the
latter is detailed.
Bols gained 90 cents to Fl 49.90 and Wessanen Fl 1.30 to Fl 105.50 on news
that the way to their planned link-up is clear after 95 per cent of Bols
shares were tendered for a swap in Wessanen shares.
ZURICH was in a quiet, pre-Easter holiday mood and while Wall Street's firm
opening helped prices to recoup some of their earlier losses, the SMI index
closed 6.4 lower at 2,183.9.
ISTANBUL rose 3.8 per cent on top of last week's 11.5 per cent cumulative
gains, taking the market index 237.1 higher to a second consecutive
all-time-high of 6,544.11.
Buying was heaviest in some motor and cement companies on expectations of
strong first quarter profit figures.
STOCKHOLM recouped some early losses as US investors began buying but a
pre-holiday mood kept trading mostly thin and dull. The Affarsvarlden index
shed 6.6 to 1001.9
Ericsson's B share fell SKr4 to SKr270 after trading as low as SKr265 after
Lehman Brothers downgraded its rating of the telecommunications group to
neutral from outperform.
OSLO was little changed and the all-share index eased 0.07 at 441.06.
However, Aker, the engineering group, rose sharply in a display of renewed
investor confidence after a series of setbacks. Aker B shares rose NKr4.5 to
SKr55.5 while the A shares gained NKr1.5 to NKr50.
HELSINKI was easier although the slide was partially stemmed by the firmer
performances of Nokia and Cultor. The Hex index shed 0.5 per cent to
1,029.1. Nokia which announced a big contract early in the day saw its
preferred share rise FM7 to FM134 while the ordinary shares added FM5 to
FM142.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier day as oil issues
show strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were flat to slightly higher in a lightly traded session
yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average managing a small
improvement after posting a 68-point drop on Friday, writes Laurie Morse.
Market analysts said strength in oil shares and a recovery in tobacco
marketer Philip Morris helped the Dow Average higher, while the broader
market was flat.
The Dow closed 8.38 better at 3,379.19, while the more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged forward 0.90 to 442.29 and the American SE
composite was 0.32 firmer at 417.84. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.86 at
670.71. New York SE volume amounted to 238.63m shares, down from Friday's
323m.
Philip Morris's stock, which lost 23 per cent of its value on Friday after
the company said it would reduce the price of its best-selling Marlboro
cigarette in an ongoing price war with tobacco discounters, recovered
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 7/8 and was the most actively traded issue of
Monday's session.
Other US tobacco giants were mixed, with RJR Holdings, the recent spin-off
of RJR Nabisco, slipping Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 6 1/2 and American Brands
closing steady at Dollars 30.
The shock of Philip Morris's name-brand discounting spread to other
non-durable consumer products stocks yesterday. Procter &amp; Gamble was Dollars
1 3/8 lower at Dollars 47 3/8 , while personal care company Gillette lost
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 and Colgate-Palmolive fell Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 62 1/2 . Analysts said price-cutting could extend to branded items
such as detergents, disposable diapers, and mouthwash.
Friday's timber summit in Seattle lent support to forest products companies.
Weyerhauser gained Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 42 1/4 , while Georgia Pacific
advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 61 3/4 and Louisiana Pacific finished Dollars
1 3/8 higher at Dollars 70.
IBM ended unchanged at Dollars 52 5/8 , after trading higher initially on
news that it plans to cut the compensation packages of employees who leave
the company after July 1, a development which may hasten planned personnel
cuts at the computer giant.
Oil issues boosted the Dow Average, with Exxon finishing Dollars  3/4 ahead
at Dollars 67, Texaco Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 64 3/4 and Chevron
Dollars 2 1/4 stronger at Dollars 83 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO finished mixed after a heavy trading session, with gains in the oil
and gas and financial services sectors compensating for transportation share
price losses.
Traders said market sentiment on Canadian banks is generally on the upswing.
One commented: 'People like bank stocks because they think the worst is
over. They expect earnings to improve once all the loan/loss provisions are
taken care of.'
The TSE 300 index gained 9.3 at 3,604.4 but declines outpaced advances by
330 to 303, with 267 issues steady. Volume came to 53.1m shares valued at
CDollars 512.84m.
Active shares included Suncor, which dipped CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 25 1/8
on volume of 7.6m shares after the Ontario Energy Corporation sold its
entire Suncor stake for a total of CDollars 190m, and Pure Gold Resources,
which firmed 14 cents to 60 cents with 1.8m shares changing hands.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Budget consensus boosts
Nikkei to another peak
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had reached a consensus
over the size of the supplementary budget at the weekend boosted activity,
and the Nikkei average closed at a new high for the year in heavy volume,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose by 312.52, or 1.6 per cent, to 19,759.46. It saw a day's low
of 19,357.90 on profit-taking by domestic institutional investors, but
active buying by foreigners and individuals pushed it up in the afternoon to
peak at 19,820.60.
Volume totalled 1.2bn shares against 1.5bn. Advances led declines by 778 to
329, with 71 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
climbed 25.04 to 1,551.35, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.34
to 1,209.38.
Strong buying by foreign and individual investors lifted laggard stocks but
domestic institutions, such as insurance companies, maintained a cautious
stance.
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, investment strategist at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment
Management, said: 'It is a mini-bubble caused by low interest rates.' He
predicted that, although the index could rise above the 20,000 level, most
conservative Japanese investors will remain on the sidelines.
Meanwhile, the proposed amount of the upcoming supplementary package
encouraged investors. The LDP is pushing for a Y13,000bn fiscal package,
which includes Y9,000bn in public spending, Y2,000bn in social
infrastructure, and Y2,000bn in additional lending to home buyers and small
businesses.
Construction companies were higher on a move to public works-related stocks.
Obayashi rose Y80 to Y717 and Taisei Y81 to Y799.
The brokerage sector was the top gainer of the day, appreciating 5.97 per
cent. Nomura Securities advanced Y60 to Y2,250 and Nikko Securities Y110 to
Y1,120.
Stocks which had led the recent rally took a breather. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone moved in a narrow range and closed unchanged at Y1m, while Tokyo
Electric Power fell Y79 to Y4,100 and Tokyo Gas lost Y1 to Y592. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, was unmoved at Y405.
The higher yen was ignored by investors and exporters closed firmer. The
dollar finished Y0.17 down against the yen at Y113.83. Hitachi added Y44 at
Y890 and Toyota Motor Y50 at Y1,560.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 355.41 to 21,426.29 in volume of
42.6m shares.
Roundup
THE REGION offered little reaction to Wall Street's tumble last Friday. Hong
Kong, Taiwan, Seoul and Bombay were closed for public holidays.
MANILA rose by 2.3 per cent, lifted by a new law granting Mr Fidel Ramos,
the Philippines president, special powers to solve the severe energy
shortage. The composite index closed 35.10 up at 1,515.40 as combined
turnover expanded from 336.34m pesos to 540.34m.
Public utility Manila Electric reflected the news, the 'B' shares rising
17.50 pesos, or 5.7 per cent, to 322.50.
KUALA LUMPUR reported frenzied speculative buying, with volume hitting a new
high of 884.13m shares, up from a previous peak of 547.32m last Friday, but
afternoon profit-taking trimmed share price gains and the KLSE composite
index ended just 4.68 ahead at 656.13.
Activity focused on finance stock Idris Hydraulic, which surged to a high of
MDollars 2.31 before finishing at MDollars 2.01, up 43 cents from Friday's
close.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index posted a new closing high for the
second straight session, ending 12.66 stronger at 1,700.82. Turnover was
heavy at SDollars 508.23m.
There were useful gains in domestic blue chips and institutional demand for
big local banks, and government-linked blue chips such as Keppel and
NatSteel were also strong.
AUSTRALIA shrugged off the worst effect of Friday's Wall Street drop,
brokers giving credit to good sentiment in Asia. The All Ordinaries index
slipped 13.0 to 1,670.1 in turnover of ADollars 278.8m.
Tobacco shares weakened following Philip Morris's US announcement of steep
discounting in its Marlboro brand. Philip Morris shed ADollars 15 to
ADollars 100, Rothmans 20 cents to ADollars 5.50 and WD and HO Wills 10
cents to ADollars 2.35.
CRA declined 16 cents to ADollars 13.24, while Coal &amp; Allied dipped 8 cents
to ADollars 11.40 after the Tokyo-based Ube Industries, the second largest
shareholder in Coal &amp; Allied with an 11 per cent stake, said it will reject
CRA's ADollars 11.50 per share offer.
NEW ZEALAND recovered from a 17-point fall to close a net 3.95 off at
1,562.74, mostly due to strength in leading forestry shares.
A rise in Fletcher Challenge from a session's low of NZDollars 2.50 to close
at NZDollars 2.54, and a 4-cent gain in Carter Holt Harvey to NZDollars 2.88
contributed to the recovery. Volume was a moderate NZDollars 20.5m.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Japan looks for action on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS BY Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party towards agreeing the
size and shape of this month's supplementary budget, and expectations that
the package would exceed last August's Y10,700bn plan, underpinned the
strong performance by Japanese equities last week.
The stock market news from Tokyo had its ups and downs. After a strong
start, aggressive profit-taking as the yen appreciated against the dollar
followed during the Tuesday and Wednesday sessions.
However, by Thursday, the market was moving sharply ahead as investors
concentrated once again on government plans to stimulate the economy:
Friday's trading volume, at 1.5bn shares, had risen to levels not seen for
more than three years.
Among analysts bullish about the outlook for Japan, Mr Nicholas Knight at
Nomura in London sees an imminent rise in the Nikkei index above 20,000.
That could be just the cue that foreign investors, currently underweight in
Japan, might take to buy, ready for a ride on the Nikkei to a minimum of
23,000 by June and 28,000 later in the year.
'To talk about selling a market that could still go up a further 50 per cent
this year clearly sounds crazy, but then so would the market be at those
levels,' Mr Knight states in the latest Nomura global strategy note.
'This does not mean that it will not get there, but we do not want to be in
it when it does.' he says.
Overall, the World Index moved modestly ahead, with Europe flat, North
America turning easier but the overall strength coming from the Pacific
Basin.
Among the Europeans, Scandinavia continued to turn in strong performances
but Austria was a weak spot with interest in shares poor and volumes low.
Italy, also weak, found itself with a government in limbo, awaiting the
country's electoral reform referendum on April 18.

FT  06 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softens against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR drifted down against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers continued to
digest the poorer than expected US employment report released on Friday,
writes James Blitz.
In very quiet trading in London, the dollar opened at about DM1.5980, after
having enjoyed a sharp rebound against the German currency last Friday
afternoon. It finished in London at DM1.5955, down almost a pfennig from
Friday's close. In New York trading, the US currency finally stood at
DM1.5945.
Friday's non-farm payroll figure, showing a net drop in the March month of
22,000, continued to leave dealers uncertain about the direction of the US
economic recovery.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said that
when the US employment data for the last three months were looked at as a
whole, there were clear signs of an economic upturn in the US.
'In the first quarter of 1993, jobs were being created at the rate of
150,000 per month, compared with 100,000 per month in the fourth quarter of
1992,' he noted.
However, Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets took a more pessimistic
view of the dollar's prospects. In his weekly report, he said that the
payroll data were disappointing and would set the tone for all the March
economic data coming out this month.
He also believed that the dollar's rebound on Friday afternoon was options
related, and probably squeezed out short dollar positions from the market.
'The weaker tone shown by the dollar this morning seems likely to continue,'
he said yesterday.
An additional reason for uncertainty on the dollar was continuing
disappointment about the speed of German interest rate cuts.
Some dealers appeared to expect that the Bundesbank would ease the rate at
which it offers wholesale funds to German commercial banks - the repo rate -
this week. But, with German call money yesterday trading at around 8.23 per
cent, it would be hard for the Bundesbank to bring the repo rate much below
the current lowest accepted rate of 8.17 per cent, for fear of trigg-ering
'round tripping' by the banks.
This factor continued to keep the D-Mark strong in Europe. The lira, in
particular, weakened sharply against the German currency at the start of
trading, on news that police investigations into Mr Giulio Andreotti, the
former Italian prime minister, were broadening. However, after touching the
L999 level to the D-Mark at the beginning of the European morning, the lira
later rallied to end unchanged on the day at L993.8.
The French franc, on the other hand, appreciated to a close of FFr3.391 per
D-Mark from Friday's finish of FFr3.398. The Bank of France's decision not
to lower its intervention rate, contrary to some dealers' expectations,
supported the franc.

FT  06 APR 93 / Money Markets: French rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE-MONTH interest rates in the French cash market were a little firmer
yesterday lunchtime after the Bank of France decided to leave its
intervention rate unchanged, writes James Blitz.
One week into the lifetime of the new French government, there were strong
expectations that the authorities in Paris would ease monetary policy to
stimulate the French economy.
However, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unaltered at 9.10 per
cent. As a result, one-month cash firmed slightly from about 10.30 per cent
at the start of the day to about 10.35 per cent.
It later fell back to a level that was more-or-less unchanged on the day as
the French franc rose to a close of FFr3.391 against the D-Mark in London.
Some analysts were baffled as to why the French authorities were leaving
official policy on hold, because the domestic pressures on the new French
government to ease policy are getting greater all the time.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman, director of Economics at Credit Suisse First Boston,
said there was a striking dichotomy between the confidence of the new French
administration and the uncertainty of the financial sector, which was crying
out for lower interest rates.
Mr Hoffman added that the recent end-of-year results of the major French
banks underlined how painful it had become for them to borrow wholesale cash
at high interest rates without passing these costs on to the retail sector.
Last week, for example, Credit Lyonnais announced a net loss of FFr1.85bn
for 1992.
A problem for the French authorities is that they cannot be sure about the
speed with which short-term German rates are coming down. The market appears
to expect that the Bundesbank will ease the rate at which it offers
wholesale funds to German commercial banks this week, but they cannot be
sure.
In the sterling cash market, short-dated rates firmed as dealers found it
difficult to remove a Pounds 1.75bn shortage forecast by the Bank of
England.
Three-month money finished at 5 15/16 per cent last night, having been at 5
7/8 per cent on Friday evening. Overnight money traded at 8.75 per cent
before lunchtime, when Pounds 1.2bn of the shortage had still not been
removed. There was late assistance of Pounds 275m.

CRA, the Australian mining group, has abandoned plans to produce gold in the
Mount Kare region of Papua New Guinea, drawing renewed attention to the
touchy relationship between the government and foreign resources companies.
The withdrawal, announced in Port Moresby on Sunday, comes three weeks after
CRA evacuated Mount Kare, claiming that staff were being threatened by rival
gangs of armed landowners.
The group rejected demands for an apology from the government, which claimed
that the evacuation was related to a financial dispute between CRA and
Kare-Puga Development Corporation (KDC), the landowners company.
CRA agreed in October to transfer to KDC its 51 per cent stake in a joint
venture which owns an alluvial goldfield in the area around Mount Kare. The
remaining shares in the joint venture are owned by KDC.
The group had intended to retain the rights to prospect for hard-rock gold
deposits, but appears to have given up hope that the security problems in
the area can be overcome.
CRA said that 'disproportionately high costs,' had been incurred at 'great
effort and risk,' in an attempt to stabilise the Mount Kare project in the
interests of landowners and the good name of the Papua New Guinea mining
industry.

COPPER touched five-week lows on the LME, helping to push ALUMINIUM down to
14 1/2 -month lows. Further losses are likely in both metals, dealers said.
Copper's decline stemmed from the fall below Dollars 2,155-Dollars 2,160 for
three-month metal. Dealers will be looking for support around Dollars 2,130
to hold, ahead of tomorrow's April option declarations, although falls
towards long-term support near Dollars 2,100 are possible. GOLD was still
consolidating its position on the London bullion market and would probably
remain for now between Dollars 338 and Dollars 340 a troy ounce, dealers
said. Arabica COFFEE was lower at midday in New York after scoring
life-of-contract lows across the board in early trading. There was no buying
interest and volume was thin. One analyst said the recent break below 59.20
cents for May had set the stage for a move to 48 cents over the next few
weeks. In London the May robusta contract managed to hold key support at
Dollars 852 a tonne. The only possible supportive factor was the likely
absence of origins owing to the imminent Easter holidays.

FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Millions of dollars and nothing
to spend it on - A United Nations fund in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORIGINALLY conceived as a central loans fund for commodity accords with
buffer stocks, the United Nations Common Fund for Commodities faces a
serious identity crisis.
The Amsterdam-based organisation, set up in 1989, is sitting on millions of
dollars it cannot use, as, one by one, the few remaining commodity
agreements with economic clauses have fallen by the wayside. At the same
time, the financing of commodity development projects, the fund's secondary
function, has been painfully slow to get off the ground.
The 105 members have put up Dollars 140m in cash and promissory notes for
its first account which, under the 1980 agreement governing fund operations,
can only be used to lend for buffer stock operations. The interest on this
money - just over Dollars 7m last year - finances the Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m
annual budget of the 25-strong secretariat, with the surplus going into a
special reserve.
Even before the fund was set up, it was clear that in the foreseeable future
it would have little use for the first account. The collapse of the tin
accord in the mid-1980s, and a steady downward trend in real commodity
prices stoked by oversupply, had already dampened enthusiasm for market
intervention to boost prices.
In the past few weeks, the latest attempts to renegotiate price
stabilisation agreements for coffee and cocoa have failed, and the rubber
accord, the only commodity pact that still has an operational buffer stock,
looks like going the same way.
This situation has led to calls by some fund members for first-account funds
to be returned unless a good use can be found for them. Meanwhile, Australia
has left the organisation and Canada will follow later this year. (The US,
though a signatory, never ratified the Common Fund accord.)
Last year the organisation established a working group to advise on future
options, in particular on shifting first-account resources to the fund's
second account, which finances small-scale research, development, marketing
and diversification projects.
However, the group's interim report shows that relatively little can be done
without a lengthy renegotiation of the 1980 agreement - one reason why it
rejected an unofficial proposal by a World Bank staffer to use first-account
money for commodity hedging schemes. 'The fund is imprisoned by an agreement
drafted over 20 years ago, since when the whole commodities situation has
changed,' says a working group member.
An executive board meeting last week (March 29-31) proposed that member
states that had not yet allocated all their allotted shares in the fund
should allocate the remainder to the second account for project loans. But
it postponed a decision on using surplus interest on first-account funds for
a revolving fund to finance project preparation costs until the need was
established.
The second account, which has so far received Dollars 73m in voluntary
government contributions, is not currently constrained by lack of cash.
Since 1989, to the irritation of many members, the fund has approved only 11
projects worth about Dollars 9.3m in total.
Officials blame the slow start mainly on the inexperience of international
commodity bodies in drawing up suitable project proposals. The fund will
shortly publish a project preparation manual showing how it should be done,
with an emphasis on projects to help the least developed countries.
In the meantime, approvals have risen from just one in 1991 to five in 1992
and perhaps 10-12 this year, including five projects authorised by the
executive board at its last meeting.
This is all a far cry from the fund's original purpose - but some developing
countries have not written it off yet. 'The fund may seem a bit irrelevant
at the moment - but with the whole world economic system in turmoil who
knows what will be the situation in five years' time?' muses one third world
delegate.

FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A quieter style of management -
Daniel Rappaport tells Laurie Morse his plans as the new head of Nymex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DANIEL Rappaport, elec-ted two weeks ago as chairman of the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the world's fourth-largest futures exchange, plans to
build on the ambitious expansion and cost-saving plans he has inherited from
his predecessor, the five-year incumbent, Mr Lou Guttman. But he is not
planning to step into Mr Guttman's larger-than-life image.
After a hard campaign, disrupted by the blast at the Nymex's World Trade
Center location, Mr Rappaport wants to keep a low profile in his new job.
'You will notice I have a different management style,' he says. 'I think the
exchange should be run most appropriately by staff. I'm basically in charge
of managing the board.'
The Brooklyn native, who trained for the law but quickly took up the
frenzied life of a crude oil futures trader, has been vice chairman of the
Nymex for two years, and acted as chairman for four months last year when Mr
Guttman took leave to address pending legal problems.
As a result he is well acquainted with Nymex issues. One of the most
pressing is the exchange's agreement to move into a Manhattan building owned
by Shearson, the former American Express unit. Shearson's acquisition by
Primerica this month requires a renegotiation of Nymex's lease, and will
delay the move to late 1994, Mr Rappaport says. He intends to preserve the
Dollars 70m in concessions contributed to the building deal by New York
City. Primerica, he says, has its own uses for the building, and is
reconfiguring Nymex space. 'We will get the same amount of space, but maybe
not the proximity to the trading floor that we wanted.'
The Nymex board is currently considering a bid for Comex (the New York
Commodity Exchange), the metals market that the Chicago Board of Trade is
negotiating to absorb. Mr Rappaport has appointed a committee to review the
issue. 'I think if we were able to acquire the Comex on favourable terms, it
would be good for the New York markets as a whole,' he says, noting the
Chicago bid had been resented by the often-fragmented New York trading
community.
Like any chief executive, Mr Rappaport is also looking for new profit
opportunities for his shareholders - Nymex members. While the Nymex has been
hugely successful in its energy products, 'we don't want to limit ourselves
to energy areas exclusively,' he says.
He is considering building on the Nymex's successful platinum contract by
launching markets in metals not listed on the Comex - and creating some
direct competition for the London Metals Exchange. 'It is interesting that
the LME has been having record volume while the Comex is faltering,' he
says.
The LME's biggest contracts are high-grade aluminium, copper, and zinc.
Mr Rappaport's other product initiative will be a financial market that
could be traded over the Nymex's electronic trading system, Access, which
was developed with American Telephone and Telegraph. He is investigating
creating a screen-based market for high-yield or 'junk' bonds.
The Access system is slated to go on-line later this year. Nymex is under
pressure to find products to list on its screens, since its contract
requires the exchange to pay AT&amp;T Dollars 4m to Dollars 6m a year in fees,
regardless of the volume Access trading generates.

FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium industry warned of
smelter shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNINGS THAT a lack of new primary aluminium smelting capacity will leave
the aluminium supply-demand balance extremely tight by 1996, forcing prices
up to unusually high levels, have come from two experienced industry
observers.
Both suggest that the industry and its financial backers will want to see
aluminium prices at about 75 cents a lb (USDollars 1,653 a tonne) for a
sustained period before giving the go-ahead for any big expansion in
capacity. It would then take about three years to get a smelter into full
production.
Three-month aluminium closed yesterday on the London Metal Exchange off
Dollars 6.25 at Dollars 1,141 per tonne, a 14 1/2 month low.
Mr Stewart Spector, of the New York-based Spector Report consultancy
organisation, points out that the industry plans no new primary smelting
capacity before 1996. At the end of 1992 western world capacity was 16m
tonnes, up nearly 4 per cent from the 15.3m tonnes at the end of the
previous year. Planned modernisation of existing smelters, offset to some
extent by scheduled closures, could boost capacity to 16.1m tonnes by 1995 -
an increase of only 0.6 per cent in two years.
Mr Spector says 1.8m tonnes of new capacity is planned for completion
between 1996 and 1998. 'However, until the supply-demand, pricing and profit
outlook improves, only South Africa's new 466,000-tonne smelter (Alusaf's at
Richards Bay) is likely to be built.'
China has several new projects under various stages of construction but many
are behind schedule and, 'as the Chinese economy expands and integrates
itself with the rest of the world, they could close many of their smaller,
inefficient smelters. These small smelters currently account for about
one-third of China's installed capacity of 1m tonnes,' says Mr Spector in
his annual survey of aluminium capacity and expansion plans.
The industry's present problems stem from very low prices caused by a sudden
surge in imports from the former Soviet Union and the failure of the western
producers to cut output quickly enough, the two observers point out.
Mr Tony Bird of the UK-based Anthony Bird Associates consultancy
organisation, suggests that the flow from Russia will dry up eventually. He
estimates that Russian costs at present average only 24.5 cents a lb
compared with the western average of 54 cents. 'But this will change
dramatically when Russian plants pay true economic prices for their inputs
and their natural inefficiency shows through,' he adds. 'In time Russian
costs will rise to 82 cents in constant 1992 money and all but one or two
smelters will be uncompetitive on western markets.'
Mr Bird estimates aluminium consumption during the 1990-2003 period will
grow at an average 3.2 per cent a year, in line with industrial production
growth. But 'growth will come in bursts, rather than in a steady stream,
thanks to the fluctuations in prices which lie ahead.' He suggests, in
Bird's latest aluminium annual review, that consumption growth will be rapid
in 1995-1996 and then be checked for a time by rising aluminium prices
before moving ahead faster again from 1999 onwards.
In contrast, aluminium companies at present plan increases in primary
smelter capacity of only 1.2 per cent a year - 'quite inadequate to provide
for likely growth in demand, the need to retire more uneconomic plants and
the coming collapse in net exports from the former Soviet Union.' Mr Bird
adds: 'The rate of new smelter construction will have to be revised upwards
sharply. And that will not of course happen unless prices recover
substantially.'

FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc rises after cuts in
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW METAL prices are forcing more lead-zinc mines to reduce output but on
the London Metal Exchange yesterday only zinc showed a substantial recovery
on news of cuts in Canada and Mexico.
Zinc for delivery in three months rose by nearly 1.5 per cent, or USDollars
13.75 to Dollars 1,020.25 a tonne, as the market absorbed analysts'
estimates that the cuts would this year remove about 110,000 tonnes of
refined zinc and 74,000 tonnes of lead.
Empresas Frisco in Mexico has suspended operations at its Real de Angeles
zinc-lead-silver mine and Curragh Resources has stopped producing
concentrates at its Faro mine in the Yukon. This follows recent reductions
by MIM, Pasminco, Cominco and Noranda.
Mr Neil Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research, suggested that the lead
market had reached a turning point and prices, which had fallen much further
than most people expected, had reached bottom. (On the LME, three-month lead
closed at Pounds 283.25 a tonne last night, up Pounds 0.50.)
Mine production cuts and the fact that new mines produced more zinc and less
lead were causing a shortage of lead concentrate (an intermediate product).
Lead smelters would have to cut production because they were running out of
raw material - 'but whether this will take one month or six months I can't
tell.'
Mr Buxton said zinc smelters were just about breaking even and had shifted
the burden of low prices on to the mines. He said the smelters were acting
'from short-term self-interest which will prolong the mutual agony.'

Platinum board

THE GRADUAL return to health of Impala Platinum, South Africa and the
world's second largest producer, continues with the announcement yesterday
that acting chief Mokgwaro George Molotlegi had accepted an invitation to
join Impala's board as a representative of the Bafokeng tribe.
The Bafokeng tribe is an important player as it owns the land that Impala
mines. Doubt has in the past been cast over the security of Impala's lease
owing to disputes about who represents the Bafokeng tribe.
Mr Michael McMahon, executive chairman of Impala commented yesterday: 'This
is a significant step in furthering our relationship with the Bafokeng
tribe, who are a vital part of our operations.'
The Bafokeng do not own equity in Impala, but in terms of a royalty
agreement are entitled to 13 per cent of taxable income.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Bonds: Flow of new issues slackens ahead of
Easter break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of new Eurobond issues started to peter out yesterday, as banks
wound down their activities ahead of the long Easter weekend, and after
record volume in the first quarter of the year.
Interest in the French franc sector of the market is resuming, following
last month's National Assembly elections. Now that the change in the balance
of power in favour of the right wing coalition has been absorbed, hopes of
some reduction in interest rates are spurring the market forward, with
five-year bonds outperforming 10-year paper, resulting in a steepening of
the yield curve.
Solvay, the Belgian chemical company, launched a FF1bn issue of five-year
bonds paying 7.9 per cent, priced to yield 85 basis points over comparable
French government paper. The proceeds of the issue, which was swapped into
floating-rate francs, will be used to pay off shorter-dated debt.
Meanwhile, the flow of Latin-American deals continued with a Dollars 50m
deal for Banco Braseg, guaranteed by the Brazilian subsidiary of the French
insurance company, Assurances Generales de France. The two-and-a-half year
deal, arranged by West Merchant Bank, was priced to yield 750 basis points
over the interpolated yield curve.
Another Brazilian bank, BBA Creditanstalt, is planning to launch a deal next
weak via ING Bank, adding to the recent surge of issuance by Brazilian
banks.
Elsewhere, Bayerische Landesbank launched a subordinated floating-rate note
with a floor or minimum interest rate of 5 per cent and a cap or maximum of
8 per cent, in line with other recent 'collared' floaters. The deal,
arranged by UBS, pays interest at  1/4 -point below the London interbank
offered rate.
Despite the reduction in cap levels from 10 per cent, when the first such
deals were launched last summer, investor demand seems to be holding up.
'Investors seem to be focusing on the upfront benefit provided by the floor
rather than on the cap,' said one dealer.

FT  06 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Flood of gilts leads to a bout of
indigestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds fell by up to  3/4 of a point at the long end as the
recent heavy supply weighed on the gilt market.
After last Wednesday's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year stock, the Bank of
England issued Pounds 600m of 10-year gilts, and on Friday it announced a
further Pounds 650m of conventional and index-linked stock for sale.
Dealers said a call for Pounds 1.8bn on partly-paid stock yesterday provided
an additional burden for the market.
'The market is coming to terms with the fact that about Pounds 5bn of calls
fall due in the next six weeks,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring
Sterling Bonds.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said: 'The auction
was well-absorbed, but the new tranches came a bit to soon - there's been
some consolidation and now there's some indigestion.'
The two new tap stocks announced on Friday include Pounds 250m of the 7 1/4
per cent gilt due 1998 and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock
due 2020.
Dealers reported some buying of both stocks, although neither tap stock was
exhausted.
The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 fell  1/8 of a point to 102 1/16 by late
afternoon while the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 dropped  23/32 to 106 19/32 .
Separately, figures released yesterday by the Bank showed that foreigners
bought Pounds 1.03bn of gilts in February, following two months of net
selling of UK government debt.
GERMAN government bonds ended firmer, ignoring comments from the Bundesbank
president that short-term interest rates were unlikely to be cut imminently.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger was quoted in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as
saying that the Bundesbank should not undertake too rapid an easing of key
interest rates.
Bund futures opened at 95.28 and traded in a range of 95.24 to 95.49, ending
the day at 95.34.
US TREASURY prices were slightly higher and the rest of the yield curve
mostly flat as traders marked time before US consumer and wholesale price
data is released later this week. The recent rise in long-bond yields has
focused attention on inflation risks. The US will report its index of March
wholesaler prices on Thursday. On Friday, a market holiday, data on March US
consumer prices will be reported. Traders expect both figures to be up 0.3
of a percentage point.
By late afternoon, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  11/32 higher
at 101 5/32 , yielding 7.028 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 7/8 to yield 3.924 per cent, and the
3-month Treasury bill was also down  1/16 at 2.90, yielding 2.94 per cent.
The Federal Reserve executed three-day system repurchase agreements today,
injecting liquidity into the banking system. The federal funds were trading
at 3 1/8 per cent late in the day. Traders said the Fed requested fixed
collateral for the repos, a factor that is tied to the fact the US is
bumping up its congressionally-mandated debt ceiling.
A Republican fillibuster in the Senate over President Bill Clinton's
stimulus package continues to block action to raise the debt ceiling. As a
result, today's weekly sale of Dollars 22.4 bn in 13-week and 26-week
Treasury bills has been postponed. JAPANESE government bond prices fell
back, taking their cue from the continued rally in the stock market and
uncertainty over the extent to which the government's supplementary budget
would be funded by bond issuance.
The futures contract opened at 108.31, down from Friday's close of 108.53,
and fell to a low of 107.97 before ending at 108.16 in Tokyo.
The bond market remained weak despite the yen's continued strength against
the US dollar. The yen/dollar rate firmed to a new high of 113.30 before
moving back to 113.75.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA considers cutting
standard settlement period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Securities Market Association is to canvas its members on
whether to shorten the current standard settlement period in the
international bond market from seven calendar days to three, or possibly
even two, business days.
Mr John Langton, Isma secretary-general, said a shorter settlement period
would help reduce systemic risk by cutting the length of time market-users
were at risk from default by a counter-party. Isma plans to raise the matter
at its annual meeting in Copenhagen in May.
Three-day settlement was recommended by the Group of 30 four years ago as
one of the standards for national settlement systems.
Mr John Dowsett, a director of fixed income brokers Luthy Baillie Dowsett
Pethick and one of the promoters of the idea, said that domestic bond
markets in a number of countries - including Germany, the UK and the US -
already operated on settlement cycles of two days or less. 'With the
technology in place these days, most people are already capable of settling
in one day,' he said.
The possible switch was generally welcomed by large brokers and traders in
London, though it is likely to meet with greater resistance from smaller
financial institutions, which could face higher costs in upgrading their
systems for a shorter settlement cycle. Isma is unlikely to recommend the
introduction of the shorter period before 1996.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Prague exchange to open today
with unlisted market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRAGUE stock exchange (PSE) will join the group of emerging eastern
European markets when it begins trading today with a small number of
unlisted securities.
Initial plans to open with a listed market have been abandoned because of
technical difficulties, but work on listing arrangements continues.
Mr Jiri Franc, PSE general secretary, said: 'The listing process is under
way, but it is very hard to choose companies suitable for listing. The whole
economy is being restructured and some companies, which six months ago
showed good results, may have big problems in the future. We want to offer
quality.'
By starting with an unlisted market the PSE hopes to establish itself before
the opening of a rival, known as the RM system. Run by Mr Dusan Triska, one
of architects of mass privatisation while at the finance ministry, it is
designed to operate as a nationwide, cheap electronic over-the-counter
market.
The backers of the RM system hoped to establish it by trading in shares from
last year's mass voucher privatisation, which involved about 1,500 companies
and in which 8.5m Czech and Slovak investors participated.
The distribution of these shares was due to start on March 29, but it has
been postponed indefinitely after a row between the Czech Republic and
Slovakia over the division of assets from former Czechoslovakia. The Czech
government said it would not transfer shares in Czech companies to Slovak
investors unless Slovakia agreed to settle.
Mr Franc, of the PSE, is cautiously optimistic on prospects. 'It will take
time for a market environment to develop,' he said. Trading will begin with
eight securities, including government bonds, and he hopes that, by the end
of the year, there will be about 15 fully-listed securities.
The exchange has 30 staff, small dealing desks for 32 dealers divided
between two floors, and 53 registered brokers. Initially, there will be a
single daily price fixing.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Investor base raised by
installing screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of Europe's electronic derivatives exchanges are hoping to increase
their market share and expand their investor base by installing screens
overseas.
The board of governors of the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German futures
and options exchange, voted on Friday to allow foreign institutions without
a German subsidiary to join the DTB. The decision still has to be approved
by Mr Ernst Welteke, the Hesse economics minister. Last year, he approved
plans to allow DTB members' branches outside Germany to install screens.
Extra Clearing, a Dutch broking firm with DTB membership through its German
subsidiary, is expected to put terminals on line in Amsterdam during the
first half of April in the first such link.
Meanwhile, Meff, the Spanish futures exchange, last week announced it had
applied for status as a designated and recognised investment exchange in the
UK. This would allow the exchange to set up Meff trading screens in the UK
and so to gain access to London's international market place.
The Spanish exchange is also holding discussions with the London Clearing
House (LCH), which provides clearing for all London's derivative markets.
Meff hopes to be able to offer its members the alternative of clearing
through LCH, which would allow them to offset their exposure on Meff
contracts against other contracts cleared by LCH.
The exchange is also lobbying Spanish authorities to allow non-resident
firms to be members of the exchange.
The board of governors of the DTB has postponed the planned integration of
Frankfurt stock exchange options with DTB options.
'At the moment there is no solution in sight which would cover costs and
ensure that the smaller orders of private customers are given equal
treatment,' said Mr Jorg Franke, DTB chief executive.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Turkish state lifts stake in
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government has increased its stake in Turkiye Isbankasi, the
country's second-largest bank, to 52 per cent.
In a controversial move, the Turkish treasury last week acquired a 29 per
cent stake in Turkiye Isbankasi from the opposition Peoples Republican Party
(CHP).
The bank is one of Turkey's best-managed, and Mr Unal Korukcu, its managing
director, is considered one of the country's best bankers. It recently
reported pre-tax profits of TL1,100bn (Dollars 117m).
The CHP's holding was once owned by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founder,
and passed to the party in his will.
At Turkiye Isbankasi's annual meeting, however, it was decided the CHP was
entitled to only 1.92 per cent of the shares. The party says it will
challenge this in the courts.
Until the 1980 military coup and subsequent ban on political parties, the
bank was controlled by the CHP. After the coup the party's stake was
represented by the presidential secretariat, which until last week had three
seats on the bank's board.
Before the treasury's latest move, Turkiye Isbankasi was an anomaly among
Turkish banks, in being state-controlled but not state-owned. Apart from the
CHP, the bank's pension fund owned 39 per cent of its shares, the treasury
13 per cent and 19 per cent was traded on the Istanbul stock exchange.
The dispute over the CHP's holding arose after a recent decision by Mr
Suleyman Demirel, prime minister, to lift the ban on political parties
banned by the generals. The revived CHP, in an attempt to raise funds, tried
to establish title to its former assets.
The treasury's move, which paved the way for it to appoint six members of
the bank's 11-man board, underscores the political rivalry between Turkey's
coalition government and the CHP over control of Turkiye Isbankasi.
Many businessmen were surprised by the treasury's move, given the
government's policy of privatisation of state assets.
According to brokers, the bank's pension fund, hitherto a dormant board
member, may buy Turkiye Isbankasi shares in the market to regain its
position as largest shareholder.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Disposals help Fermenta reduce

FERMENTA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, reaped the benefits of a
large-scale disposal programme when it announced sharply-reduced losses for
1992 yest-erday.
The group also said it was selling its remaining property activities for
SKr396m (Dollars 51.4m), which leaves it with just two main divisions,
Fermenta Animal Health and Fermenta Pharmaceuticals.
The company's loss after financial items fell to SKr115m in 1992, from
SKr1.2bn a year earlier, when its deficit was aggravated by losses from its
troubled financial subsidiary, Independent.
Independent was sold in March 1992, which explains why turnover also fell
heavily last year, to SKr469m from SKr1.76bn. The group said there would be
no dividend.
A total of SKr105m of last year's losses related to Afisa, the group's
Spanish property operation, which is being sold.
The purchaser is a bankruptcy unit linked to Independent.
Fermenta's loss after extraordinary items amounted to SKr418m, against a
SKr1.2bn deficit in 1991, after including SKr423m in one-off costs linked to
real estate write-downs and reserves.
The group's financial position strengthened last year, with interest bearing
debt falling to SKr734m from SKr4.53bn.

A GROUP of 20 Japanese companies have agreed to work with Motorola of the US
to build a Dollars 3.37bn global satellite communications system.
The companies include Sony, Mitsubishi, Kyocera and DDI, a long-distance
telecommunications carrier in which Sony and Kyocera have a stake.
The system, to be called Iridium, is designed to support a cellular
telephone network capable of being accessed from anywhere in the world. It
would offer voice, data, facsimile and positional services.
Motorola has been attempting for more than two years to assemble an
international consortium to own and operate the Iridium network.
The government of Brazil and United Communications of Thailand are reported
to have signed letters of intent to take a stake in the consortium.
There are regulatory hurdles still to be cleared, however, and Motorola is
in competition with five other US-based proposed systems, including
Constellation Communications, Ellipsat, Loral Qualcomm and American Mobile
Satellite.

A SHARPLY higher tax bill limited the increase in 1992-93 net profit at KBB,
the Netherlands' largest non-food retailer, to 2.4 per cent.
The company, primarily active in the Netherlands but also owner of the US
toy chain FAO Schwarz, said net profit before extraordinary items rose to Fl
87.2m (Dollars 48.4m), from Fl 85.1m a year earlier.
Including extraordinary items, net profit rose 26.6 per cent because the
previous year's figures were depressed by a Fl 16.2m charge to reorganise
Hema, one of KBB's Dutch store chains.
Pre-tax operating profit rose by 9.2 per cent to Fl 150.1m.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Tough times for Sanyo as
electronics loses its spark - The man charged with piloting a company which
has posted a Y1.2bn pre-tax loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a sense of urgency in the tone of Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of
Sanyo Electric, as he outlines the challenges facing the Japanese
electronics company.
'We must all make sacrifices to overcome the current difficulties, otherwise
the Japanese consumer electronics industry will be shattered,' he warns.
As the newly-installed president of a diversified consumer electronics
company which recently reported a Y1.29bn (Dollars 10.66m) pre-tax annual
loss, Mr Takano is well aware of the magnitude of the problems the industry
faces.
Although there is some talk that the Japanese economy is showing signs of
recovery, 'the future is still very uncertain,' Mr Takano says.
For Sanyo, that uncertainty looms large.
Sales have already fallen by 10 per cent in the first two months of this
year. The company is expecting flat revenues in the current year, 'but even
achieving that is going to be tough,' Mr Takano says.
Sanyo is dependent for nearly 30 per cent of its revenues on audio-visual
equipment, a market that has been one of the hardest hit by the downturn in
consumer spending. It has also been slow to rationalise and reduce costs at
a time when the long-term growth trend of the Japanese consumer electronics
market is expected to slow.
The urgency of the company's problems is reflected in Mr Takano's sudden
appointment as president in December. He replaced Mr Satoshi Iue, son of the
company's founder, and was given the specific task of overseeing Sanyo's
restructuring and rationalisation programmes. Mr Iue became chairman and
chief executive in charge of global operations.
The new president has an unenviable task. In a country where companies have
pursued market-share rather than profits, and where compulsory redundancies
are socially unacceptable, Sanyo's rationalisation and restructuring will
require a shake-up of ingrained attitudes and business practices.
'We are still very soft on ourselves,' Mr Takano says. The situation, he
believes, is worse than people realise.
Mr Takano says the recession stems in large part from changes in consumer
attitudes in Japan and a number of external pressures which will take
several years for the industry to deal with.
In the past, even when there was a huge drop in consumer demand, there were
still many consumer durables that people wanted, Mr Takano explains. Most
households had only a small refrigerator, maybe one air conditioner and at
most a 20-inch television set. So, coming out of recession, there was always
demand for larger refrigerators and TVs and more air conditioners.
This time, however, the industry is seeing very weak consumer spending, even
though people still have substantial disposable income. 'That is because
there is little they want to buy and that means this recession is not going
to be over soon.'
At the same time, Japanese companies will be forced to change the way they
operate. One factor forcing change is the need to transfer manufacturing
abroad because of the yen's continuing appreciation.
Sanyo has been shifting manufacturing of its mature products overseas. About
90 per cent of its tape recorders, for example, are now manufactured outside
Japan.
Mr Takano is worried that as manufacturing moves overseas, there will be a
growing surplus of older employees in Japan. Since compulsory redundancy is
difficult, companies will have to find ways of employing these people while
reducing their workforces. Sanyo plans to reduce its staff of 30,600 to
about 27,000 by 1995.
Mr Takano sees higher social costs becoming a growing burden on Japanese
companies. These include the cost of reducing working hours to 1,800 a year
by 1994, as targetted by the Japanese government, and meeting stricter
product liability rules and environmental issues. 'From now on, these costs
will have to be included in a company's budget,' he says.
But this is not the end of Mr Takano's list of difficulties facing Sanyo.
Sanyo has introduced a decentralised management system with separate profit
centres, aimed at raising profitability. 'From now on we have to focus on
profits rather than sales,' Mr Takano says.
The company is trying to shift operations to value-added products. Instead
of making everything itself, Sanyo will buy in more manufactured items,
particularly commodity products and those in which it has lagged other
companies, such as camcorders and office equipment.
It is focusing on areas where it is ahead of its competitors, such as nickel
cadmium batteries which are used in portable goods, clean energy products,
compressors, home appliances and cordless phones.
But in case these moves prove insufficient, Sanyo has also been diversifying
into services ranging from doughnut shops, golf driving ranges and karaoke
bars, to property and computer software.
However, all these measures will not produce results in a short time,
although in the longer term Mr Takano believes the company's future is
bright.
'The consumer electronics industry is such a major one that it is not going
to disappear,' he says.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Embraer follows industry trend
with Dollars 258m loss

<TEXT>
EMBRAER, the state-owned Brazilian aircraft maker, reflected the continuing
trouble in the world aerospace industry by posting a Dollars 258m loss in
1992. In 1991, the group lost Dollars 235m.
Sales were Dollars 312m last year, down from Dollars 402m in 1991 and
Dollars 582m in 1990.
The company blamed the poor figures on the recession in Brazil and the US,
Embraer's most important market. It also cited reduced government spending
on military aircraft due to cuts in the Brazilian air force budget.
It laid off 2,468 last year, bringing the two year redundancy total to
6,800, a 54 per cent cut in the workforce.
Embraer's best-known product is the EMB-120 Brasilia, a 30-seat regional
aircraft. It accounts for about half of Embraer's sales, but last year sales
fell to just 22 units, down from 31 in 1991 and 48 in 1990.
In a speech to employees earlier this year, Mr Ozires Silva, Embraer
president, was optimistic about prospects for 1993.
He said he was encouraged by increased demand for aircraft in South America
and the possibility of increasing revenues from providing services to other
companies. He predicted that between 2 and 3 per cent of sales might come
from the services segment this year.
Embraer is on the government's short-list for privatisation, but before the
move can go ahead the company must resolve an issue involving a group of
creditors who hold debentures convertible into non-voting stock.
If all of the debentures were converted, the government's majority voting
share could be reduced to as little as 3 per cent of total equity.
Copesul, a Brazilian petrochemical company privatised last May, unveiled an
increase in profits to Dollars 42.5m for 1992. The supplier of raw materials
for one of Brazil's three petrochemical hubs, it earned Dollars 30m in 1991.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Aerospace pares its
business to the core - Dasa is embarking on a period of consolidation as the
industry contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace faces two tough years as extensive and costly
restructuring drags the company into the red, warns Mr Jurgen Schrempp,
chairman of the new champion of the German aerospace industry.
The subsidiary of Daimler-Benz was set up by Germany's leading industrial
group four years ago as part of an ambitious plan to restructure and revive
the country's aerospace sector.
The company absorbed disparate components of the German aerospace industry,
launched a series of ambitious international partnerships and sought control
of the Dutch Fokker aircraft group.
But it has been hit by the prolonged slump in civil aviation, defence cuts
and now the slowdown in the German economy after eight consecutive years of
strong growth.
Dasa is now pausing for breath and is about to enter a phase of
consolidation. 'I don't think at this stage we will be looking for further
acquisitions: rather, I envisage one or two areas of disinvestment,' says Mr
Schrempp.
The immediate challenge will be to reduce the workforce by around 10 per
cent, involving up to 8,000 job cuts over the next two years.
The job losses, which will essentially involve the company's military
operations, risk being even higher, especially if Dasa's participation in
the four-nation Eurofighter programme remains compromised by the political
uncertainty surrounding Germany's commitment to the project.
Although the company will show an operating profit when it reports its 1992
figures on April 14, Mr Schrempp said heavy restructuring provisions would
result in an overall loss compared with a DM50m profit in 1991.
He now intends to refocus activities on commercial aircraft, aero-engines,
helicopters, defence and space. After streamlining the management structure
and cutting down corporate staff from 700 to 300 people in the past three
years, Mr Schrempp wants to dispose of non-core businesses to allow
management to concentrate on aerospace activities.
Despite short-term difficulties, he insists Daimler-Benz remains committed
to aerospace. 'There is a great debate in Germany about Daimler-Benz's move
into aerospace, but I'm convinced the strategy is right,' he says.
By 1995, he expects Dasa to start making a meaningful contribution to
Daimler-Benz profits. 'Dasa also brings to Daimler-Benz the ability and
technology of systems integrations, experience in working in international
alliances, and helps balance the risks between the group's car and aerospace
activities,' he argues.
Dasa's strategy also hinges on playing an increasingly significant role in
the new international partnerships being forged in civil and military
aerospace.
Mr Schrempp was the architect of the recent agreement between the four
European Airbus partners to co-operate with Boeing of the US on a joint
study of a new generation super-jumbo aircraft, capable of seating up to 800
passengers. He would like this co-operation extended to other US
manufacturers, as well as Russian and Japanese companies.
After successfully merging Dasa's helicopter activities with those of
Aerospatiale of France, Mr Schrempp says there are advanced talks on
integrating more closely the German and French guided weapons industry and
perhaps, at some later stage, attracting UK companies.
He expects to finalise Dasa's acquisition of a majority stake in Fokker
shortly. In turn, Fokker could become the focus of a broader European
alliance in the regional aircraft market, with the Franco-Italian ATR
regional aircraft group eventually teaming up with the new Dasa-Fokker
partnership.
On the aero-engine front, Dasa has forged a partnership with Pratt &amp;
Whitney, the US manufacturer, which is expected to include
cross-shareholding links between Pratt and MTU, the German company's
aircraft engine subsidiary. Dasa would also like to establish ties with BMW
Rolls-Royce, the recent joint aero-engine venture formed between the UK
company and the German car group.
Mr Schrempp believes Germany cannot afford to have two aero-engine companies
competing in a fierce market. But talks between Dasa and BMW Rolls-Royce
have been unsuccessful. 'We've had discussions, but their ideas and ours
don't fit,' he explains.
Although the European Airbus consortium, in which Dasa holds a 37.9 per cent
stake, produced more than DM400m (Dollars 240.90m) profits for the German
company last year, Mr Schrempp concedes the airliner market is in turmoil.
Dasa has had to scale back its Airbus production and put about 23,000 people
on short time due to the lower workload.
However, Airbus, like the investment in Fokker, remains a cornerstone in
Dasa's aerospace strategy. The roll-out earlier this month at Hamburg of the
Airbus A321, the consortium's new 180-seat, larger derivative of its A320
twin-engine airliner, was particularly important for Dasa. Up to now, final
assembly of all Airbus aircraft was in France. 'With the A321 we were able
to prove it can also be done efficiently in Germany,' Mr Schrempp says.
But his biggest headache remains the Eurofighter. Germany's revolving-door
attitude to the project continues to cast dark clouds over Dasa's role in
the programme. Germany and the three other partners (Britain, Italy and
Spain) still have to agree details of the revised terms and timetable of the
venture.
In the meantime, Dasa is having to continue honouring its obligations under
the existing Eurofighter contract when German government funds are becoming
inadequate to cover its commitments in the development programme. 'We still
don't know what the future holds,' says Mr Schrempp. 'I hope meetings will
take place soon to resolve this situation.'
Ironically, a German exit from Eurofighter would probably have a positive
impact on Dasa's short-term financial position, Mr Schrempp claims.
'But that's not a consideration. I'm personally convinced we need the
aircraft and the damage would be great for us and Germany if we are not part
of the programme,' he insists.
Not only would it be a significant technological blow for Dasa, with huge
repercussions on employment, it would also have broader implications for
Germany's and Dasa's international standing.
'If we are labelled an unreliable partner, it will seriously undermine our
ability to work in international collaborations.' And that is the
rapidly-growing trend in the aerospace business.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of preferred shareholders of Marriott, the hotels and management
services group, has filed a suit against the company and its management,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The group says a corporate reorganisation would take away 'the vast bulk of
Marriott's income-producing assets'.
That, the plaintiffs said, would leave them with virtually all of the
depressed property assets and the bulk of its large interest expense.
The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court April 2 by H. B. Korenvaes
Investment, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, AKT Associates and
UBS Securities.
The group holds the equivalent of a 6.4 per cent stake, or about 6.85m
common shares, in Marriott. The stake includes 2.2m preferred shares
convertible into common stock.
'The plaintiffs are to receive nothing in this reorganisation plan except an
as-yet undisclosed reduction in their conversion price,' the group said in
the suit.
The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to stop the reorganisation being
carried out.

chief
</HEADLINE>

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday unexpectedly named Mr Richard Wagoner, its chief
financial officer, to replace Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as
head of worldwide purchasing last month and joined Volkswagen in Germany.
Mr Wagoner, 40, who was only named chief financial officer last November,
will continue to hold that position as well as taking on Mr Lopez's
responsibilities.
The move surprised some analysts, who questioned whether Mr Wagoner would be
able to devote sufficient time to the purchasing job, and noted that he had
spent much of his career on the financial side of GM, rather than in
manufacturing.
Reform of the purchasing system - including pressuring suppliers outside and
inside the company to cut prices - forms a crucial part of GM's drive to
turn its lossmaking North American car operations back to profit.
Mr Lopez is believed to have saved GM more than Dollars 1bn in costs during
his 10 months in the job; an important element of his success was his
obsessive, idiosyncratic and energetic nature.
Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said yesterday that daily staff
operations of the finance group would be overseen by Mr Leon Krain, a
corporate vice-president, allowing Mr Wagoner to focus immediately on his
purchasing responsibilities.
Chrysler, the smallest of the 'big three' Detroit car makers, announced last
night it would be taking a Dollars 4.7bn after-tax charge in the first
quarter for the adoption of a new standard of accounting for retirees health
benefits.
The charge will have no cash impact. All US companies are having to adopt
the new accounting standard and Ford and GM have already announced much
larger charges.

<TEXT>
GOODYEAR, the Ohio-based tyre manufacturer, yesterday forecast first-quarter
profits after tax in the range of Dollars 83m to Dollars 86m.
This would represent a significant improvement on the Dollars 66.1m (before
extraordinary items) seen in the same period of 1992, and the Dollars 90.1m
loss reported in the first three months of 1991.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said at the company's annual meeting that sales
in the first three months of 1993 would show an advance of about 2 per cent
on the same quarter of 1992, when the restated figure was Dollars 2.68m.
Goodyear shares closed down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 1/2 .
The meeting also voted to approve an increase in Goodyear's authorised
common stock to 300m shares from 150m, Reuter reports.
The company had announced previously plans for a two-for-one stock split,
which will be effected in the form of a 100 per cent stock dividend to
shareholders.
Goodyear has reduced its debt load to some Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars
3.62bn in 1990, much of it coming through the sale of assets.
Mr Gault said that the company's big asset sales were now behind it.
He added that Goodyear's Celeron unit, which owns its All American crude oil
pipeline system, became profitable in the fourth quarter of 1992. The unit
lost Dollars 52m in both 1990 and 1991.
It reduced that to a Dollars 15m loss for 1992 but Mr Gault said that
Goodyear planned to sell Celeron eventually.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Ontario sells 14% stake in
Suncor for CDollars 190m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PROVINCE of Ontario has ended a controversial and costly 12-year foray
into the energy industry by unloading its remaining 14 per cent stake in
Suncor, a large Canadian oil and gas producer.
Ontario Energy Corporation, a provincial agency, yesterday sold its 7.6m
Suncor shares to two securities firms, RBC Dominion Securities and
ScotiaMcLeod, at CDollars 25.25 per share. Total proceeds are about CDollars
190m (USDollars 150.7m).
Suncor's controlling shareholder is Sun Co, the Pennsylvania-based energy
producer, with a 67.6 per cent stake.
Ontario's involvement with Suncor dates back to the energy crisis of the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when the province paid about CDollars 650m for a
25 per cent stake.
Suncor suffered a CDollars 228m loss last year, largely as the result of a
CDollars 360m restructuring charge.
Ontario last year cut its stake in Suncor from 25 per cent to 14 per cent as
part of the wider effort to contain the budget shortfall by selling assets.

protection

<TEXT>
CURRAGH, the Canadian lead and zinc producer, yesterday filed for court
protection from its creditors after failing to overcome a succession of
financial and operating setbacks.
Mr Clifford Frame, chairman, said the move was 'forced on us by our lack of
liquidity'. He said he was optimistic that Curragh would emerge from court
supervision as a 'healthy and successful' company.
Although Curragh plans to continue operations, it announced late last week
that weak metal prices had forced it to suspend production for two months at
its principal mine, the Faro lead and zinc property in the Yukon. The Sa
Dena Hes mine, also in the Yukon, in which Curragh has an 88 per cent stake,
has been mothballed for three months.
Curragh's problems have been compounded by the closure of its Westray coal
mine in Nova Scotia since an explosion there last May killed 26 miners.
The explosion has been the subject of intense media and political scrutiny.
The police are expected to announce within the next few weeks whether legal
action will be taken against the mine management.
A writedown of the Westray assets contributed CDollars 16.6m (USDollars
13.1m) to Curragh's 1992 loss of CDollars 54.3m. Losses in 1991 totalled
CDollars 98.3m.
The future of both the Yukon and Nova Scotia operations is clouded by their
dependence on government funding. Other mining companies strongly criticised
the financial help given to Curragh in the mid-1980s which enabled it to
reopen the Faro mine. Faro was owned by the debt-ridden Canadian energy
group, Dome Petroleum.
Curragh is negotiating a CDollars 34m loan guarantee from the Yukon
authorities to enable it to develop a new open pit on the Faro property. It
has also been seeking an injection of equity.
As part of its efforts to raise cash, it sold a minority stake last year in
Asturiana de Zinc, the Spanish metals producer.
Curragh said it expected the two Yukon mines to produce 432,000 tonnes of
lead and zinc concentrates this year, against a forecast 704,000 tonnes.

protection from creditors

<TEXT>
LESLIE Fay, the US womenswear manufacturer which has been bedevilled by news
of accounting irregularities recently, has filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
Making the filing, Leslie Fay said that disclosure of the irregularities -
which had boosted profits by inflating stocks and reducing the cost of goods
sold - prompted its banks to 'severely limit the company's working capital
facility, in both amount and duration'.
As a result, the company would not be able to obtain the necessary 'piece
goods' from its suppliers for the autumn season.
However, in conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing, Leslie Fay is securing a
new Dollars 100m 'debtor-in-possession' loan facility from Citibank.
It says it will be able 'to continue the flow of merchandise to its
customers without delay or interruption'.

<TEXT>
THE PROVINCE of Ontario has ended a controversial and costly 12-year foray
into the energy industry by unloading its remaining 14 per cent stake in
Suncor, a large Canadian oil and gas producer.
Ontario Energy Corporation, a provincial agency, yesterday sold its 7.6m
Suncor shares to two securities firms, RBC Dominion Securities and
ScotiaMcLeod, at CDollars 25.25 (USDollars 20) per share. Total proceeds are
about CDollars 190m.
The shares are being re-sold to institutional and retail investors.
Suncor's controlling shareholder is Sun Co, the Pennsylvania-based energy
producer, with a 67.6 per cent stake.
Ontario's involvement with Suncor dates back to the energy crisis of the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when the province paid about CDollars 650m for a
25 per cent stake.
As a net consumer of oil and gas, Ontario was eager to have a window on the
production side of the business centred in western Canada.
But the subsequent fall in oil prices, coupled with mediocre management,
have badly dented the value of Ontario's investment.
Suncor suffered a CDollars 228m loss last year, largely as the result of a
CDollars 360m restructuring charge.
The province's eagerness to realise whatever value it can from Suncor has
been compounded by a yawning budget deficit.
Ontario last year cut its stake in Suncor from 25 per cent to 14 per cent as
part of the wider effort to contain the budget shortfall by selling assets.
Suncor is an integrated company, with businesses ranging from a tar-sands
oil recovery plant in Alberta to a chain of filling stations.

<TEXT>
TRANSPARENCY is all the rage among big Austrian companies these days as they
try to increase their appeal to international investors.
But the idea of disseminating information in a fair and orderly way is not
one that comes easily to the clannish Viennese.
Consider the misadventures of Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, in
the past few days.
Yesterday, the bank, which has already applied for a listing on the London
Stock Exchange, announced that it was launching an American Depository
Receipt (ADR) programme, a move likely to encourage US investor interest in
the bank's shares.
The news was distributed to journalists in the morning with a request not to
publish it until noon, presumably so that European investors would not have
an edge over American ones.
However, an advertisement sponsored by J P Morgan, the bank's US depositary,
had already revealed the story in the morning's European financial
newspapers.
In any event, the real news from Bank Austria yesterday emerged from an
impromptu press conference in Vienna given by the bank's chairman, Mr Rene
Alfons Haiden.
The bank's dividend for 1992 would be cut from 14 per cent to 12 per cent,
Mr Haiden disclosed. That news should not have been published until April
22, when the bank, which is the product of a merger between Zentralsparkasse
and Oesterreichische Landerbank in 1991, is to reveal its 1992 financial
results.
Perhaps Mr Haiden, a Zentralsparkasse man, was trying to re-establish his
competitive standing as a bank spokesman. Last Thursday, Mr Gerhard Randa,
the deputy chairman and a former Landerbank man, lifted the veil on another
aspect of the bank's 1992 results, telling Reuters news agencythat the
operating profit was roughly unchanged at Sch3.3bn (Dollars 295m).
Mr Randa, who still maintains his office and staff in a different building
from that occupied by Mr Haiden, also expounded on the bank's plans to take
full control of Wiener Holding, the sprawling conglomerate of industries and
services held by the city of Vienna. Some Sch2.1bn worth of new Bank Austria
equity would be issued to the city in return for the stake, he revealed.
Surprisingly, these informal disclosures have had virtually no impact on the
price of Bank Austria shares - which suggests that market insiders in Vienna
already knew what was coming.

Dutch operations

COCA-COLA Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coke and 44 per cent-owed by
Coca-Cola itself, yesterday announced three acquisitions for a total of
Dollars 360m.
The moves will further consolidate bottling operations for the Atlanta-based
soft drinks company.
One of the businesses being acquired by CCE is Coca-Cola Beverages
Nederland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola, and the bottler of its
products in the Netherlands.
This purchase take CCE's interests outside the US for the first time.
In 1992, CCB Nederland sold the equivalent of about 82m unit cases,
producing revenues of some Dollars 320m. It accounts for about 40 per cent
of fizzy soft drink volume in the Netherlands.
CCE, despite the substantial Coca-Cola stake, is a public company and quoted
separately on the New York Stock Exchange.
It expanded significantly when it merged with Johnston Coca-Cola in 1991,
and now distributes about 53 per cent of Coca-Cola's US bottle and can
volume.
The other two companies which CCE is acquiring are domestic - Roddy
Coca-Cola Bottling and Coca-Cola Bottling of Johnson City, Tennessee.
These businesses hold the licences for the Knoxville and Johnson City,
Tennessee, areas, which in turn serve more than 1m consumers.
Last year, the equivalent unit case volume reached around 18m, and produced
revenues of about Dollars 86m.

<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment is leaving its historic headquarters at The Mill, in
Maynard, Massachusetts.
The move reflects the drastic changes that are under way within the company
as it streamlines operations and struggles to regain competitiveness.
'This was a very difficult decision for the company to make,' said Mr Robert
Palmer, president and chief executive of Digital, who last year succeeded Mr
Ken Olsen, Digital's founder.
'This site holds a very special place in our history. As the location where
the company first planted its roots, The Mill has acted as a strong symbol
for Digital,' he said.
Built in 1847 as a woollen mill, Digital's headquarters building dominates
the small New England town of Maynard. It is a warren of stairs and
wooden-floored offices, full of character and tradition, but lacking the
efficiency of a modern office block.
'The spacious, idiosyncratic Mill was a home that suited a growing
engineering company,' Mr Irving Burg, property manager of The Mill, recalls
in a company history. 'The challenge of negotiating the byways of connecting
floors and buildings still satisfies the 'Mill rats',' the name Digital
gives to Mill employees.
Digital will keep its headquarters in Maynard, but many employees will be
transferred to other sites, primarily in eastern Massachusetts.
Digital said it would work with local officials on plans for The Mill
complex.
Companhia Cervejaria Brahma, Brazil's leading brewery and beverage company,
posted a consolidated profit of about Dollars 63m in 1992, down slightly
from Dollars 73.1m in 1991, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Pirelli agrees to sell holding
in Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday ended a long
corporate takeover struggle by agreeing to sell its holding in Continental,
its bigger German rival, to Deutsche Bank.
The bank will retain 5 per cent of the total stake of 33.4 per cent in
Continental that is changing hands, taking its holding to 10 per cent. The
bulk of the remainder will go to government and business interests in
Continental's home state of Lower Saxony.
The Norddeutsche Landesbank, the central bank for the state of Lower Saxony,
is buying 15 per cent of the shares. It will hold 5 per cent on its own
account, while three other local companies - Preussen Elektra and two
insurance groups - will buy the remaining 10 per cent via a bond issue
convertible into Continental shares between 1995 and 2000. The price is
DM235 a share and NordLB is guaranteeing a 6 per cent annual coupon.
Mr Peter Fischer, economics minister of the state of Lower Saxony said the
solution would block 'possible foreign influence' over Continental. 'The
company will be able to get on with running its business without worrying
who its shareholders are,' he said.
The remainder of the stake, some 13 per cent, will be placed with big German
banks and institutional investors.
Pirelli, which was forced into a radical restructuring partly by the losses
on its aborted bid, will post a L140bn (Dollars 87.8m) extraordinary profit
on the deal.
The complex transaction, covering more than 2.9m shares, envisages the sale
by Pirelli to Deutsche Bank of 5 per cent of Continental held by its
Amsterdam-based Pirelli Tyre Holding subsidiary.
Pirelli will also exercise options to buy 28 per cent of Continental's
shares owned by Italian investors and held by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant
bank. Options on a further 5 per cent of Continental's shares will be bought
back from Pirelli by Mediobanca.
Mediobanca's motives for repurchasing the options are unclear. A Pirelli
executive denied the holding might represent the basis for some future
attempt at developing links between the two groups.
However, Mr Hubertus von Gruberg, Continental's chief executive, said in
Hanover yesterday that the transaction could facilitate future co-operation.
Last year, Pirelli used its stake to block Continental's plans for a rights
issue.
Deutsche Bank is buying the shares for DM250 each, a substantial premium on
yesterday's stock market price of DM204. Pirelli will not receive the
proceeds, nor exercise its options, until December 30.
Pirelli will also gain from the fall of about 30 per cent in the value of
the lira against the D-Mark since buying its shares and options in
Continental.
In all, Pirelli will receive DM733.6m (Dollars 458.5m) for the combined
shareholding. Net proceeds after exercising the options will amount to about
L330bn. The failed takeover was the main factor behind Pirelli's L670bn loss
in 1991. Apart from writing down to DM207 a share the value of its
Continental stake, bought for about DM300 a share, the company was also
obliged to pay previously-secret indemnities to other Italian investors.
Yesterday's transaction still leaves Pirelli considerably worse off than had
it not mounted the takeover. However, the terms vindicated its policy of
aggregating its stake through options and seeking a premium to the shares'
stock market price.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Growth puts Rinascente under the
spotlight - Fiat-controlled Italian retailer is a possible acquisition
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED earnings and sales from La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer,
could increase its appeal to potential acquirers.
In spite of the deepening recession, sales last year grew by 9.7 per cent to
L5,040bn (Dollars 3.16bn), while earnings for the Fiat-controlled group rose
marginally to L102.2bn against L100.9bn in 1991.
The improved profits, coming in spite of higher taxes, were accompanied by a
L10-a-share dividend increase. Meanwhile, labour costs, a traditional
weakness, rose only marginally due to lower wage rises and improved
productivity.
Though Rinascente's return on sales remains poor, the figures underline the
view of Mr Giuseppe Tramontana, managing director, that the group represents
'the key' to Italian retailing.
That role has pushed Rinascente into the spotlight since comments by Mr
Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, that Rinascente is not a core business.
With Fiat facing plunging profits and heavy spending, the retailer is
believed to be for sale. Fiat owns 51 per cent of the ordinary shares, with
the remainder listed.
The list of potential buyers should be long. Italy is one of western
Europe's least developed retailing markets, with a excess of tiny,
family-run shops and a dearth of the big department stores or out-of-town
shopping centres familiar elsewhere.
There are 82 people for each traditional small retail outlet, compared with
153 in France and 250 in the UK. In 1991, Italy had only 48 department
stores and 124 hypermarkets nationwide, against 320 and 940 respectively in
France and 340 and 610 respectively in the UK.
Change is under way. Around 5,500 small food stores have been closing a year
since 1988. Recently, the shrinkage has accelerated and affected the
non-food sector. Mr Tramontana estimates between 20,000 and 25,000 small
retailers went out of business last year. Meanwhile, the number of
supermarkets has surged.
However, Mr Tramontana denies that negotiations are under way to sell
Rinascente. For many analysts, the obstacle is Fiat's demand for too high a
price. Whatever the truth, Rinascente's appeal has grown thanks to its
investments in new stores, which have depressed earnings but also made it a
more attractive long-term prospect.
Annual investments have been running at almost L300bn in the past four
years. In 1992, spending rose to L420bn, although L130bn came from a
sale-and-leaseback arrangement at one new shopping centre.
In all, the group plans to invest L2,000bn in the 1992-96 period.
Most of the money has gone into hypermarkets, which now total 18, and the
SMA supermarkets subsidiary, which has grown to 119 units.
Almost 60 new speciality stores for home furnishings, do-it-yourself and
consumer electronics have also been developed.
Turnover from hypermarkets surged 122 per cent in the period 1988-91;
supermarket sales increased by 113 per cent; while sales at the
do-it-yourself and home furnishing chains went up by 200 per cent and 104
per cent respectively.
New openings have been combined with remodelling and closures at
Rinascente's troubled Upim variety store chain.
Modelled on the mid-to-lower segment all-purpose US stores of the 1950s,
Upim failed to move with the times. Although often in prime sites, the chain
of 157 directly-controlled outlets and 362 franchises has suffered from
inadequate investment, leading to a tatty look and out-of-date image.
Last year, 15 Upims were converted for other uses, while a further 21 were
shut for conversion into franchise operations.
'We don't think the process is finished, with up to 20 more stores still to
be changed in the next two years. But we think the remaining outlets can
contribute well, especially at a time of economic difficulties, when this
style of store can be popular with consumers,' says Mr Tramontana.
Although restructuring and investment should make Rinascente a more
attractive acquisition, some bankers question the conventional wisdom that
it is just waiting to be plucked off the tree.
Many say Rinascente's range of activities is too broad. Some purchasers
might want the hypermarkets and supermarkets, but could be put off by the
flagship La Rinascente department stores, which might appeal to a different
buyer. And finding a taker for Upim, even after restructuring, may not be
easy.
Mr Tramontana denies that a break-up is the solution. 'It's not a business
which can be divided, as all the pieces are interconnected,' he says. 'No
one else is present in so many sectors. With retailing in Italy in ferment,
any buyer will want to be present across the board.'
That shrinks the list of possible acquirers to Europe's biggest retailers.
Alternatively, Rinascente could appeal to a financial institution, either
alone or in consortium, which would take it over pending an eventual sale or
flotation, he thinks.
In spite of rumours of behind-the-scenes talks, there are no clues as to a
change of ownership.
One of the market's favourite scenarios - a takeover by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Standa group - is scotched by Mr Tramontana, who says that
negotiations have never been held.
Even the big French or German retailers, who have often been portrayed as
the most likely buyers, have so far been cautious in Italy.
Germany's Tengelmann bought a Tuscan supermarket chain in the late 1980s,
but has done little since; France's Carrefour entered the Italian
hypermarket scene enthusiastically, pulled out, and is now edging back.
None seem over-enthusiastic about taking over Rinascente, making recent
speculation in its shares, which have climbed by about 40 per cent since Mr
Agnelli's hints last June, hard to justify.

DEUTSCHE Babcock, the German machinery and plant engineering group, said
group sales in the first half of the fiscal year which began October 1 were
18 per cent higher than those of a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Bonn.
The rise to DM3.1bn (Dollars 1.86bn) represents a slowing from the 22 per
cent sales gain to DM2.5bn reported for the first five months of this fiscal
year.
Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, said order inflows in the fiscal first
half were DM5bn, 55 per cent higher than those of a year before. Last month,
the company had reported a 47 per cent increase in five-month orders to
DM3.8bn. Adjusted to exclude newly-acquired units, he said orders rose 32
per cent.
Order backlogs at March 31 were DM9.4bn, 29 per cent higher than a year
before. Adjusted to exclude acquisitions, the gain in order backlogs was 5
per cent.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Miroglio takes stake in GFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GFT, the lossmaking Italian clothing and textiles group, has agreed to sell
a 'significant' stake to Miroglio, its slightly smaller counterpart, via a
capital increase.
No financial details of the deal, to be concluded by June 30, have been
revealed. However, it is expected that Miroglio, based in Alba, will buy a
majority stake in Turin-based GFT, subject to detailed consideration of its
trading position.
GFT, owned by the Rivetti family, is Italy's third-biggest clothing group
after Benetton and Marzotto, with annual sales of about L1,500bn (Dollars
940m). The privately-owned and publicity-shy Miroglio, owned by the family
of the same name, has annual sales of about L1,200bn.
Miroglio has been seen as the most likely investor in GFT, which has plunged
into substantial losses owing to rising costs and falling demand for many of
the expensive designer label clothes it produces. In contrast, Miroglio has
concentrated on cheaper lines, many of which are produced outside Italy.
Sasib, the precision engineering and railway signalling equipment group
controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company, posted a sharp
fall in net profits to L41.6bn last year from L73.2bn.
The company attributed the decline to lower extraordinary earnings,
recession and restructuring costs at some recent acquisitions.
The rapid growth of Sasib, which raised sales by 12.9 per cent to L865bn
last year, has come partly though the purchase and turn-around of lossmaking
operations. Adjusted for acquisitions, sales rose by 11 per cent.
The profits slump triggered a L50 cut in the dividend to L180 for ordinary
and preferred shares and L200 for savings stock.
Sales and earnings on the railway signalling side improved substantially,
but the group's food processing equipment activities had mixed fortunes.

FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: GE Capital buys Reliance Group's
life subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE Group, the insurance concern controlled and headed by Mr Saul
Steinberg, is selling its life insurance subsidiary, United Pacific Life
Insurance, to GE Capital for approximately Dollars 550m.
UPL has around Dollars 6.2bn in assets and Dollars 680m in annual revenues,
and its main business is the writing and marketing of annuity products
through financial institutions and insurance agents. Reliance revealed last
week that it had put the business up for sale, in an attempt to bolster its
capital base.
At that stage, Reliance said that it had two potential buyers offering to
pay in excess of Dollars 500m, adding that one of these purchasers - putting
up the lower amount - had begun litigation over the sale proceedings.
Yesterday, Reliance said that the legal action was now being terminated.
GE Capital is the financial services arm of General Electric Company of the
US, and its assets exceed Dollars 92bn.
The company noted yesterday that it had recently acquired GNA Corporation,
which specialises in tax-deferred annuities.
'The combination of UPL and GNA will mean that we have an organisation with
unparalleled marketing capabilities and more than Dollars 12bn in assets,'
it said.
GE Capital added that it expected the market for annuities and
pre-retirement savings plans to double by the turn of the century.
It suggested that the two acquisitions would 'position us as a major player
in this growing market'.
The sale to GE Capital - which will require regulatory approval - came as
Reliance disclosed a Dollars 35.6m loss after tax in the 1992, compared with
a Dollars 148.2m deficit in 1991. This partly reflected a Dollars 100m
write-off on the sale of UPL, offset by a Dollars 40m gain on the earlier
sale of the Frank B. Hall insurance broking business.
Reliance said that its continuing operations - predominantly
property-casualty insurance interests - made a loss of Dollars 43.2m, while
the 'discontinued' life business made a profit of Dollars 57.3m.
The group noted that results from continuing operations were below
expectations because of record catastrophe losses and weak pricing in many
commercial lines.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Export rise behind growth at Highland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in exports of Famous Grouse whisky drove Highland
Distilleries' first half operating profits ahead 13 per cent to Pounds
13.3m.
Famous Grouse exports during the six months to February 28 rose 11 per cent
in volume and 21 per cent in value.
Since the alliance with Remy Cointreau in 1990, which greatly extended
distribution of Highland's leading brand, exports have increased from 25 per
cent to 38 per cent of total sales, with significant growth in France,
Sweden and Greece.
Interim pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 21.2m, with
Pounds 1.4m of the increase coming from the underlying business and Pounds
5.1m from a change to equity accounting of the company's 35.4 per cent stake
in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky blender.
Earnings per share benefited from the accounting change, rising from 7.7p to
11.2p.
The interim dividend is raised to 1.6p (1.45p).
Turnover advanced from Pounds 96.8m to Pounds 98.3m in what Mr John Goodwin,
chairman, described as 'difficult trading conditions.'
Sales of new malt whisky fell 21 per cent and mature whisky volumes were
also lower, reducing profits by about Pounds 1m. Mr Goodwin said that
volumes were likely to be 23 per cent lower this year and to remain flat in
1994. Highland's distilleries were working at 40 per cent of capacity this
year compared to 50 per cent last year.
Famous Grouse maintained its premium price position in the UK market at the
expense of some volume, but improved market share from 13.7 per cent to 14
per cent.
Because of exchange and interest rate uncertainties, the company repaid at
an additional cost of Pounds 4.9m, a Pounds 30m loan, raised in French
francs in 1990 to help finance its investment in Orpar, the Remy holding
company. Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 2.8m.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Clydesdale Group set for market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDESDALE GROUP, the electrical goods retail chain, plans a Stock Exchange
flotation in late June which is expected to raise Pounds 30m in new money
and capitalise the company at about Pounds 80m.
The flotation is aimed at largely wiping out borrowings, currently standing
at about Pounds 32m, and at financing an expansion programme in England
which is already under way. Clydesdale's merchant bank is Rothschilds and
its broker is NatWest Securities.
Clydesdale has been expanding rapidly since 1990 and has added 23
out-of-town stores in England to its 86 high street and 11 out-of-town
stores in Scotland. In the next 12 months it plans to open a further 20
out-of-town stores in England as far south as Birmingham and Peterborough
It claims to have 2.7 per cent of the highly fragmented UK electrical goods
retail market. But though this sounds small, Clydesdale believes it is the
third largest company in the sector which is worth some Pounds 10bn. The
leader is Dixons, which includes Currys, with 12.7 per cent, followed by
Comet with 5.5 per cent.
Clydesdale is setting itself what it calls 'a loose target' over an unstated
timescale of raising its market share to 10 per cent.
The key man is Mr Henk van Eck, a Dutchman who came in as chief executive in
1985 at the behest of institutional investors led by Ivory &amp; Sime, the
Edinburgh fund managers, after the company ran into serious problems two
years after a management buy-out. He was able to insist on getting 51 per
cent of the company.
Mr van Eck sacked the entire management and 27 per cent of the staff, shed
non-core businesses and closed nine stores in England. 'When business began
to turn down with recession in the third quarter of 1988 we'd already pared
the business right down. That is why we were virtually the only regional
retailer in our sector to survive the recession, if you exclude the regional
electricity companies,' he said.
In 1990 Clydesdale secured the funds it needed to expand and reduce its debt
 -gearing had reached 400 per cent. It placed Pounds 11.5m of new equity and
arranged Pounds 26m of bank facilities. Mr van Eck's stake was diluted to 29
per cent and the other big shareholders are now Scottish Amicable and
Standard Life, each with 20 per cent.
As well as adding out-of-town superstores to its high street base,
Clydesdale has differentiated its marketing strategy to appeal
simultaneously to the ABC1 market segment and the C2 and DE segments. It has
cut its inventory from 15 weeks to 10 weeks by delivering and installing
most large items from two central warehouses, one in Glasgow and a new one
near Wakefield, South Yorkshire.
'Our efficiency and our low cost base enable us to offset the much bigger
bulk purchasing discounts which the bigger groups get,' said Mr van Eck.
Turnover in the year to March 31 1993 is estimated at Pounds 140m, against
Pounds 71.2m in 1991. Operating profit is likely to be Pounds 7m, against
Pounds 4.4m in the 14 months to March 1992, and pre-tax profit is likely to
be Pounds 4m.
'Unlike some of our rivals which are expanding northwards from a high cost
base in the south of England, we are heading south from a cheap Scottish
base,' Mr van Eck said.

Losses came to 5.46p (earnings 7.22p). The final dividend is 3p for an
unchanged total of 4.3p.
Turnover in 1992 rose from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 47.5m. Again bad debts and
related costs took their toll, amounting to Pounds 859,000 (Pounds 930,000).

DOLPHIN Packaging con-tinued to suffer from difficult trading conditions in
1992 and saw pre-tax profit halved, from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 1.51m.
The dividend, however, is maintained at 4.5p with a final of 2.8p. Earnings
per share were 5.22p (10.55p).
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 27.8m) reflecting lower
selling prices but also higher product volumes, said Mr Moger Woolley,
chairman.
Dolphin and DRG Plastics have agreed to settle their dispute which began in
June 1991, after DRG brought legal proceedings against Dolphin regarding its
rotary thermoforming process.
The agreement maintains the confidentiality of the process with Dolphin
selling its rotary thermoforming machinery to DRG at an agreed commercial
value.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV advances by 18% to top Pounds
10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Television, which last year regained its franchise with a Pounds
2,000 a year bid, yesterday reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 8.62m to Pounds 10.1m, for 1992. Sales were up some 11
per cent at Pounds 126.1m.
Advertising revenues rose 3 per cent to Pounds 90.8m and the sale of
programmes was 32 per cent up at Pounds 23.2m.
Mr Gus Macdonald, managing director, said new orders had already been
received for series like Doctor Finlay and Taggart which would ensure
'another significant increase for 1993'. He believed that operating margins
of 14 per cent before the levy were among the best in ITV.
Reorganisation, including the cost of early retirement and voluntary
redundancy, led to a Pounds 4.61m exceptional charge. The company has
written off its Pounds 1.8m share of the start-up costs of Good Morning
Television, where it has a 20 per cent stake.
Earnings per share rose from 11.4p to 13.9p. The final dividend is 8.2p to
give 9.92p (8p) for the year.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: ITN chairman puts emphasis on profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Green, chairman of Independent Television News, warned yesterday
that the group must move from being 'cost driven to profit driven', and that
it must 'develop other sources of revenue from home and abroad'.
Mr Green, also chairman of Carlton Communications, refused to be drawn on
possible further job cuts: 'There are no jobs for life, but we don't have a
piece of paper saying 'these are the new job cuts''. Staff levels have been
reduced from 1,100 to 650 in the last two years.
Mr David Gordon, the new chief executive, highlighted ITN's need to increase
its international business, 'both for input and distribution' of news
programmes.
Mr Gordon, previously chief executive of The Economist, said he hoped to
bring to ITN an 'understanding of the importance of editorial quality'.
Last week the Department of Trade and Industry approved a seven-member
consortium takeover, under which new shareholders have committed Pounds 30m
to fund ITN, and will in principle buy its London headquarters for Pounds
74m from Stanhope Properties. ITN previously had 15 shareholders.
The restructuring was in part prompted by what are understood to be Pounds
5m annual losses on the headquarters.
Mr Green said yesterday: 'There are no property problems for ITN', adding
that the board believed it made better financial sense to buy the property
than spend Pounds 8.6m annually in rent. He added that other, unspecified
tenants are interested in renting surplus space.
In the 17 months to end-1992 it is believed ITN made an operational profit
of between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 3m for the 1991
year.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon shows advance to Pounds 125.7m -
Market awaiting decision on how Pounds 428m cash pile will be spent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING UK profits at MB-Caradon, the building products and security
printing company, led to its first write off of advance corporation tax at a
cost of Pounds 3.4m.
Mr Anthony Hichens, chairman, said ACT this year would have been an even
greater problem without last week's sale of the stake in CarnaudMetalbox,
the packaging company.
The problem should disappear as the UK economy recovers, especially if
Caradon uses its Pounds 428m cash pile to buy a UK company, he said.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 125.7m in 1992 while
turnover fell 2 per cent to Pounds 664.4m.
UK profits were hit by continuing recession and one-off costs. At Everest,
the replacement window and double glazing company, about Pounds 2m was lost
after the company mistimed recovery.
A further Pounds 3m of disruption costs were incurred in commissioning new
radiator plants in the UK.
In total, and including US restructuring, the company spent Pounds 11.7m on
reorganisation during the year.
Year end net borrowings increased by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 44.9m, giving
gearing of 9 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 525.1m.
On a fully diluted basis, earnings increased to 15.8p (15p) per share. The
final dividend of 5.9p makes a total of 8.65p (8.43p).
The shares fell 2p to 318p.
COMMENT
Hardly surprisingly, the market was far more interested in Caradon's
takeover plans than yesterday's results - almost every name in the building
materials sector has now been mooted as a target. Caradon insists it will
not be hurried into making its move; equally, it will not wish to be seen to
dither, especially with UK interest rates this low. The company appears to
be preparing itself and its followers for a significant bid, preferably on a
friendly rather than hostile basis, and it is likely to start looking in the
UK or, possibly, Germany. Meantime, forecasting profits for this year will
be difficult because of the exceptional and currency gains. But underlying
earnings are likely to be little changed, reflecting recovery in the UK and
US against a slowdown in Europe and the replacement of CMB profits by
interest earnings. On that basis, the shares are trading on 20 times and
look fully valued, even if investors decide Caradon now deserves to be rated
as a building materials company rather than a conglomerate.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: 600 jobs to be axed in shake-up at Seeboard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEEBOARD, distributor of electricity for the south-east of England, is to
cut its headquarters staff by a fifth in one of the most significant
decentralisation programmes implemented by an electricity company since
privatisation.
Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, announced the changes yesterday along with up
to 600 job losses, boardroom changes and the appointment of a consultancy to
manage computing and information technology activities.
From the middle of next year Seeboard will move its headquarters to Forest
Gate, Crawley, West Sussex. The eventual aim is to have 100 headquarters
staff, compared with 500 at the existing base in Hove.
About 100 jobs will disappear and the remainder will be transferred to other
locations. Mr Ellis said the headquarters move would reduce overheads and
improve operational management and control of the businesses. This would be
reinforced by the creation of three 'business streams', each to be run as a
separate profit making business with 'clearer lines of accountability and
responsibility'.
The company will be divided into distribution, responsible for the cables
network and overhead lines; supply, responsible for buying and selling
electricity and gas; and business, responsible for retailing, electrical
contracting and other activities.
Customer services will support distribution and supply through three
enlarged units at Hove, Croydon and Hythe. Three other units will close. The
computing and IT activities are to be run by Andersen Consulting.
Mr Ellis said between 500 and 600 job losses would take place over the next
year or so from the existing staff of 5,600. The company was confident this
could be achieved largely through voluntary means, in conjunction with
retraining and redeployment. About 400 people over the age of 55 had already
indicated a desire to leave.
The board changes involve Mr John Quinn, 53, who becomes group finance
director, Mr Len Jones, 61, managing director of distribution, Mr Stephen
Gutteridge, 38, managing director of supply, and Mr John Weight, 45,
managing director of the business group.
Three of them are already boardroom members. Mr Weight will join the board
in July.
Mr Terry Boley and Mr Maunder Wide are retiring this year from their jobs as
corporate strategy director and company secretary. Both are board members.
Other management appointments are Mr Rod Danes, 46, as director of customer
services, Mr Tony Smith, 43, director of resources and Mr Mike Nagle, 40,
company secretary.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Heavy carpet losses leave Lamont 22% lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY LOSSES in a carpet subsidiary helped to depress pre-tax profits at
Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based textiles company. Yesterday it
reported a 22 per cent decline for 1992, from Pounds 8.11m to Pounds 6.3m.
Mr Richard Milliken, chief executive, said the fall reflected a Pounds 2m
loss in Shaw Carpets and a further Pounds 1m deficit in the computer
business.
Steps had been taken to stem the losses, including the reduction of Shaw's
workforce by 17 per cent and a refocus of the company on less expensive
volume products.
This latter tactic was expected to recoup some of the market share lost in a
competitive sector. Lamont estimated that the market as a whole had declined
by 10 per cent, while Shaw's turnover had fallen some 18 per cent.
Margins - which had dropped by 3 to 4 per cent during the year - continued
to present difficulties.
Total costs of rationalising the loss-making businesses came to about Pounds
250,000 in 1992. A further Pounds 400,000 in costs would be taken in the
current year. Mr Milliken said the full benefits of rationalisation were not
expected to feed through until 1994.
Regarding ICS Computing, Mr Milliken said Lamont was still in discussions
over a sale.
Group turnover was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 115.5m, including a
seven-month contribution from textile printer Alexander Drew &amp; Sons. This
business produced profits of not less than Pounds 3m in that period.
Mr Milliken said other businesses had performed reasonably well, either
virtually maintaining or increasing profits.
Capital expenditure was increased from about Pounds 4m to Pounds 11m, with
just over half spent on two carpet operations. As a result of this
investment and debt acquired with Alexander Drew, interest payments rose
from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 698,000. Mr Milliken said the group aimed to
reduce its debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds from 24 per cent to
roughly 12 per cent.
Mr Milliken said the outlook for the current year was better, with Lamont
expecting to reduce the losses at Shaw. As a result, the final dividend is
maintained at 8.5p, for an unchanged total of 12p. Earnings, partly
depressed by the 1-for-4 rights last year to pay for Alexander Drew, fell
from 21.84p to 16.09p.
However, Mr Milliken remained 'cautious and cagey' considering the lack of
any sign of real upturn in the markets served by the carpet companies. 'We
do not anticipate any help from the market this year,' he said.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Decline in tobacco profits leaves T&amp;S 6%
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in profits from tobacco retailing and from shop disposals lay behind
a fall of more than 6 per cent at T&amp;S Stores last year.
The pre-tax figure declined from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 12.5m on sales up 10
per cent at Pounds 345.3m (Pounds 314.2m).
Operating profits were ahead to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 12.4m), but lower
profits from disposals, reduced interest income and a charge for
reorganisation hit the pre-tax line.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman and chief executive, said it had been a
frustrating year. 'A number of growth opportunities came to nothing as
either price, quality or a combination of both proved to be a stumbling
block.'
The group remains keen to expand its convenience store network.
It has admitted that it looked at the Circle K chain, recently sold to
Watson &amp; Philip for Pounds 21m.
The Dillons convenience stores increased their profits to Pounds 3.89m
(Pounds 3.12m) on sales of Pounds 68m (Pounds 52.1m). Eleven stores were
opened, mainly in the second half.
However, the advance in convenience stores was undone by a fall in profits
from Pounds 3.76m to Pounds 3.16m, on sales of Pounds 175.3m (Pounds 165.4m)
at Supercigs. Margins were squeezed by increased competition.
To try to improve the business, the discount formula was being rolled out
from cigarettes to magazines and greetings cards.
At the Dillons newsagents, profits were flat at Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 5.57m)
on sales of Pounds 102.1m (Pounds 96.7m).
T&amp;S said Pounds 1m of annual costs had been taken out of the business. At
the year-end the group's overdraft was Pounds 9.5m, compared with Pounds
12m.
The company said this was seasonal and it often had up to Pounds 10m cash in
the bank.
Earnings per share slipped to 15.17p (15.71p).
The final dividend goes up to 3.5p to give a total of 5.9p (5.5p).
COMMENT
T&amp;S has some defensive virtues, but in a weak market these have not been
sufficient to keep earnings moving ahead. Growth is seen as coming mainly
from acquisitions, but it is a long time since the big leap forward made in
spring 1989 with the acquisition of Preedy and Dillons from Next. Analysts
are not only holding their breath waiting for the next deal - and the
anticipated issue of paper - but also on the outcome of the discount
magazines experiment. Previous attempts have fallen foul of the wholesalers.
T&amp;S believes it has the muscle to pull it off and that scrutiny of the trade
by the MMC will keep the wholesalers on their best behaviour. Because of a
sharply rising tax charge, the group would have to sprint this year to stay
level on earnings per share. Profits are forecast to rise to more than
Pounds 13m, giving a prospective p/e of 12-13 on yesterday's close of 173p.
At this discount to the market, it is well worth holding.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: A pig's ear over book keeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Cumbrian farmers and auctioneers has been forced to send out a
circular to shareholders after it made a pig's ear of its 1992 accounts.
Following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's
accounting standards watchdog, Penrith Farmers' &amp; Kidd's has distributed a
supplementary statement to the accounts.
NT O'Reilly &amp; Partners, the company's auditors which has had to issue a new
audit report with the statement, said: 'In our opinion it is now clear that
the original financial statements on which we reported . . . failed to
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.'
In a covering letter to the 600 shareholders dated April 1, Mr David
Hibbert, company secretary, says the new statement revises a number of
differences between the 1991 accounts and the 1991 comparative figures shown
in the 1992 accounts.
The Review Panel ordered the distribution of the supplementary note - the
first time it has taken such action. Mr Hibbert estimated the cost would be
Pounds 200-Pounds 300.
'This has pulled us up short and made us look more closely at the accounts,'
he said yesterday. 'But the changes were just cosmetic. They did not affect
the profit or balance sheet totals.'
The errors were first highlighted at a stormy annual meeting last autumn,
which led to a complaint to the review panel by Coss &amp; Mounsey, one of the
shareholders.
The supplementary note shows that turnover, administrative charges, income
from investment, interest payable and other operating income for 1991 were
all shown differently in the 1992 account than in the previous year's
report.
A freehold property disposal had been incorrectly classified as a leasehold
disposal in the 1991 accounts, an amount of ACT has been re-credited to a
different category, and directors' remuneration includes benefits, which
were not shown in the 1991 accounts.
Mr Joseph Rain, chairman, could not come to the phone yesterday. A secretary
said he was out 'weighing sheep'.

Courtyard Leisure, the USM-quoted wine bar and restaurant operator, is
making board changes and seeking to raise Pounds 284,000 through an open
offer and subscription.
The move follows increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 58,000)
for the six months to September 30.
There was a net interest charge of Pounds 30,000, against income last time
of Pounds 25,000.
Turnover increased to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 805,000) mainly the result of
acquiring a further wine bar in March 1992.
Mr Jonathan North, chairman, said costs were being cut but it was thought
new capital was needed. An open offer of 3.48m shares at 10p on a 1-for-3
basis is being made.
Mr Ali Safa, at present joint managing director, and Ennerdale Trust will
subscribe for the shares not taken up. In addition, Mr Safa and Mr Brian
Chandler are being offered options on 248,000 shares at a minimum 15p.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: James Capel directors quit over losses on
venture fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE SENIOR directors of James Capel, the UK-based stockbroker owned by
HSBC, resigned yesterday over losses of up to Pounds 16m on an eastern
European venture capital fund.
The three were Mr James Fergusson, the broker's managing director, Mr Peter
Green, head of international operations, and Mr John Webster, head of
Capel's New York office.
Capel did not announce the reasons for the resignations, but all are
believed to have been linked to the failure of New Europe Hotels, a company
launched at the end of 1990 to raise money for hotel developments in eastern
Europe.
The company's shares were sold mainly through James Capel's New York office,
and two Capel executives joined the New Europe board.
The company collapsed last year, leaving investors with what is thought to
have been almost a total write-off. Capel is believed to have compensated
investors who bought shares through its New York office, at a cost to the
broker of as much as Pounds 16m.
Capel's Pounds 7.5m operating profit for last year, after restructuring and
after charges, was struck after the compensation costs, the company said.
At the time New Europe was launched, Mr Fergusson was head of Capel's
international operations and Mr Green ran the New York office.
Capel moved quickly yesterday to announce replacements for the three
departing executives. Mr Bob Benton, head of the UK institutional equities
division, was named as managing director; Mr Peter Maynard, former head of
compliance, is to become president of James Capel in New York; and Mr Duncan
Agar, an institutional equities salesman, has become head of the
non-European international desks in London.
After the announcement of a new deputy chairman last Friday, the
appointments amount to a substantial overhaul of the senior management of
the UK broker.
Mr Peter Letley, who joined Capel as finance director in 1988, was named
deputy chairman under Mr Bernard Asher, the HSBC director who took over the
Capel chairmanship two years ago.
Mr Benton said yesterday that the management upheaval did not imply any
change of direction at Capel.
The broker would continue its efforts to build trading and corporate finance
operations on the back of its established international equity distribution
business, he said.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Confusion at SelecTV as legal probe is
completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION still surrounded the affairs of SelecTV, the independent
television production company last night, following the completion of a
legal investigation by company solicitors Richards Butler.
SelecTV yesterday issued a statement saying that the report had drawn
attention to 'certain minor technical shortcomings in the formal
administration of the company.'
The release added that the appropriate remedial action had already been
taken.
Following the issuing of the statement, it is believed Richards Butler
contacted SelecTV suggesting that the statement may not have been wholly
supported by their draft report.
The main issue of contention seems to have been the fact that Richards
Butler regarded the matters under investigation as serious allegations.
SelecTV then issued a new press release saying it wanted to make clear that
the report it commissioned from Richards Butler included allegations
relating to Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive.
'After considering the report the board has concluded that Mr McKeown should
at once be exonerated from allegations of misfeasance,' the statement said.
Richards Butler, whose report has not been published, then withdrew its
reservations.
SelecTV confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Brook, until recently deputy
chairman and managing director of TVS Entertainment, will join the board as
chairman. He is expected to head a remuneration committee which will look
into the salaries of directors. He is also expected to look at the rent paid
to Mr McKeown for the house he owns in central London which is used as
company offices.
The rent was the main item in a writ issued against Mr McKeown by Mr Michael
Buckley, chairman, with the knowledge of Mr Peter Laiser, an independent
director. The writ was never served and when it became public Mr Buckley was
ousted as chairman.
Last night Mr Buckley said that the events of the day confirmed his view
that the company should now appoint an independent firm of solicitors to
look at all the issues that led to the issuing of the writ.
A number of directors confirmed yesterday that an increase in the rent paid
to Mr McKeown from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 80,000 a year had happened
without being recorded in board minutes. The directors insisted that they
all knew about the increase, which reflected the fact that other SelecTV
subsidiaries had moved into the house.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil chief gets 20% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company, awarded Mr Clive
Thompson, chief executive, a 20 per cent pay rise last year, taking his
emoluments from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 707,000.
The increase compared to a 29 per cent rise in Rentokil's pre-tax profits
and earnings per share in the year to December 31.
Mr Thompson's emoluments have increased by 2.64 times since 1989, when he
earned Pounds 267,000. In the same period, Rentokil's profits and earnings
have increased by just under twice. According to Rentokil's annual report
about half Mr Thompson's emoluments last year were incentive payments in
line with a plan introduced in 1988.
Kennedy Financial Services, a company owned by Mr David Newbigging,
Rentokil's chairman, was paid Pounds 58,000 in compensation for Mr
Newbigging's services. Kennedy also received Pounds 18,000 as fees for
providing office facilities for Rentokil.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Further losses at ABB Transportation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Transportation, the UK train maker formerly known as Brel, reported
another period of pre-tax losses and warned that order books are running out
because of the government's plans for railway privatisation.
Pre-tax losses were reduced to Pounds 6.9m in the 15 months to December
1992, compared with Pounds 41.3m in the year to September 1991; turnover
rose from Pounds 299.5m to Pounds 401.2m.
However, the previous figure was struck after exceptional restructuring
costs of Pounds 37.6m, so the outcome marked a deterioration from losses of
Pounds 3.7m before exceptional items last time.
The group, privatised in 1989, is now owned 85 per cent by Asea Brown Boveri
and 15 per cent by its employees. It started running into difficulties soon
after privatisation when it failed to meet production schedules on new
trains for BR.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Butte sells last operating asset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTTE MINING has sold its last operating asset, a zirconium business based
in Stoke-on-Trent, for Pounds 100,000 cash.
When the deal is completed Butte effectively will be a 'litigation' company.
It is claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m (Pounds 229m) in the US
against more than 70 former directors, advisers and investors. This might
take some years to resolve.
Butte said yesterday its Zirceram subsidiary had sold the zirconium
opacifier business and related assets to PE Hines, a privately-owned
supplier to the ceramics industry.
Zirceram retained the freehold of its property and Hines hadtaken a
three-year lease and an option to acquire the freehold at any time during
the lease period for the lower of Pounds 100,000 and an independent
valuation.
Mr David Lloyd Jacob, chairman of Butte, said Zirceram had incurred losses
for five years and, while new management installed at the begining of last
year had increased sales and reduced losses, 'significant new investment
would have beenneeded to obtain even a modest profit.'

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: L and M rises 10% to Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON and Manchester, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 10
per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.4m, slightly ahead of
analysts' predictions.
Net insurance earnings were up 22 per cent at Pounds 19.3m, but the weak
state of the residential property market inflicted losses on the group's
mortgage and residential estate agency subsidiaries.
A recommended final dividend of 9.6p makes a 14.25p (13.572p) total.
Earnings per share emerged at 14.3p (12.87p).
After tax of Pounds 6.29m (Pounds 5.75m) and minorities net profits emerged
at Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 15.4m before extraordinary items).
Profits of the life business included a proportion of the transfer made last
year of the assumed long term rate of return on the shareholders' share of
the life fund assets.
L and M took the opportunity that this transfer presented to make heavy cuts
in the annual or reversionary bonuses it guarantees to policyholders. This
increases the company's strength, and allows greater investment flexibility,
but reduces guaranteed returns for policyholders.
The group's estate agency incurred a net loss of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.8m),
and the number of houses sold fell from 5,900 to 5,200. Its mortgage
business, hit by the same problems, made a trading loss of Pounds 3.7m
(Pounds 266,000 profit), having incurred bad debt provisions of Pounds 9.4m.
Mr John Thomson, chairman, said the economic climate had badly affected
these non-insurance businesses, but added: 'There is now clear evidence that
these businesses are moving out of recession and the prospects for 1993 look
promising.'

<TEXT>
Farepak yesterday expanded its food hamper business with the Pounds 8.5m
purchase of Littlewoods Hampers from the mail order and retailing group.
Similar to Farepak's core activities, Littlewoods Hampers sells food, drinks
and non-food Christmas items through local agents. Combining the two
businesses will significantly cut costs and improve profits in the 1993-94
year, Farepak said.
The agreement also gives Farepak access to Littlewoods' mail order lists and
databases for 20 years.
Farepak will pay Pounds 4m initially and further payments of Pounds 900,000
are due annually for five years.
Tangible assets acquired have a book value of Pounds 140,000. Pre-tax
profits were Pounds 360,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.2m for the 1992 year.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Sears' Galliford division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the speciality retailer, yesterday announced the management buy-out
of its Galliford Housebuilding division for Pounds 27.1m.
The disposal will give rise to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 28m, which is
the difference between the purchase price and net assets. This will be
included in Sears results for the year ended January 31.
Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, said: 'The disposal of Galliford completes
the exit programme from housebuilding activities that Sears announced in
1990 and enables us to concentrate on our retail and home shopping markets.'
The buy-out, financed by Schroder Ventures, has already paid Pounds 24.2m
cash with the balance due in October. This will amount to Pounds 500,000
cash and Pounds 2.4m in tax losses to be transfered from the subsidiary to
Sears.
Galliford, which has nothing to do with Galliford plc, the northern
construction company, has been loss-making for three years.
However, its losses before interest have fallen from about Pounds 16m three
years ago to Pounds 7.5m on sales of Pounds 48.9m in the last financial
year.
It has raised Pounds 10m of equity, primarily from Schroder Ventures and its
affiliated funds, and Pounds 16m of debt from the Midland Bank.

FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible ahead 27% - Shares dip 11%
as analysts question acquisition provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group, yesterday
appeared to be the first casualty of possible revisions to the rules on
acquisition accounting.
The share price fell more than 11 per cent to 289p after the group released
results for the year to January 3 1993 which led analysts to reappraise the
group's repeated use of acquisition provisions.
The Accounting Standards Board last week issued a discussion draft that
suggested the cost of incorporating acquisitions should be taken directly in
the profit and loss account and not via provisions set up at the time of
acquisition that only affect the balance sheet.
Morgan Crucible was reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 61.3m, a 27 per cent
increase over 1991 results adjusted down from Pounds 61m to bring them into
line with new FRS 3 accounting rules.
On this new basis, diluted earnings per share were up 38 per cent at 18.7p.
Underlying earnings per share rose from 17.7p to 19p.
The group further surprised analysts by setting up new provisions for
acquisitions in its carbon division that took place nearly three years ago.
Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said delay in starting the reorganisation
had resulted from a Federal Trade Commission study of Morgan Crucible's
market share.
The Dollars 6m cost of reorganising this division was now being included in
Pounds 8.8m of new provisions for prior year acquisitions. However, the net
increase was Pounds 4.8m after the group wrote back Pounds 4m of provisions
no longer required.
Mr Graham Swetman, finance director, said the share price fall had been
overdone. Analysts had paid too much attention to the provisions and not
enough to the results of a group that had done well compared with its
competitors in a difficult recession, he said.
Apart from the question of provisions, the actual results were broadly in
line with expectations. The rise in gearing to 67 per cent was anticipated
following the departure of sterling from the EMS last September.
Interest during the year was 7.6 times covered. The total dividend is
maintained at 12.6p with a proposed final of 6.85p.
Operating profit margins fell to 10 per cent for the group as a whole. The
carbon and thermal ceramics divisions both suffered lower operating profits.
Carbon sales increased from Pounds 112m to Pounds 125m but profits fell from
Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 15.6m. Thermal profits fell from Pounds 23.1m to
Pounds 20.8m on sales of Pounds 208m.
Speciality materials and technologies profits rose from Pounds 18.4m to
Pounds 19.2m on sales of Pounds 190m, while technical ceramics improved from
Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 15.7m on sales of Pounds 157m.
Mr Farmer said the best prospects for growth were in North America,
south-east Asia, the Pacific rim and Australia, where the group has about 50
per cent of its sales.

FT  06 APR 93 / Chief executive leaves FT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Palmer, chief executive of the Financial Times since 1990, has left
the paper.
Pearson, the publishing, banking and industrial group which owns the FT,
said yesterday Mr Palmer was 'leaving the Pearson Group with immediate
effect because of differences in management style'. Mr Palmer, 52, has been
replaced by Mr David Bell, currently advertisement and marketing director.
Neither Lord Blakenham, Pearson's chairman, nor Mr Frank Barlow, managing
director, would comment further.
Mr Palmer thanked FT staff for their 'hard work, friendship and camaraderie
over the past 29 years'. He said his successor would bring 'vision, drive,
competitiveness and warmth' to the management of the paper.
The signs were yesterday that behind Mr Palmer's abrupt departure lay an
accumulation of differences over many months rather than any single large
policy issue.
It is believed that Mr Palmer's relationship with Mr Barlow had become
increasingly tense. There was said to be a growing view that Mr Palmer was
not working effectively as a member of a management team.
As long ago as 1978 Lord Drogheda, a former FT managing director, wrote of
Mr Palmer in his memoirs: 'He can go as far as his defiant nature permits
him.' Mr Bell has a reputation for a more diplomatic approach.
Mr Palmer joined the paper in 1964 as a reporter, moving up the ranks to
become deputy editor and then general manager.
Mr Richard Lambert, the Financial Times' editor, emphasised the change at
the top of the FT had nothing to do with matters of editorial policy.
'David Palmer's flair and determination has played a large part in making
the FT a leader in its chosen field,' Mr Lambert said yesterday.
Colleagues emphasised three achievements:
As news editor, Mr Palmer broadened the paper's coverage away from its
narrow City origins.
In 1977, he played a key role in the move to overseas printing which turned
the FT into an increasingly international newspaper.
As general manager, Mr Palmer handled the introduction of new technology and
the paper's new printing plant in London's Docklands.
Mr Bell, 46, also started at the FT as a journalist, joining from the Oxford
Mail in 1972. He had been due to replace Mr Richard McClean, the deputy
chief executive, who is leaving to be chief executive of the International
Herald Tribune in Paris, but now takes the top job. Mr Barlow becomes
chairman of the FT in succession to Lord Blakenham.

FT  06 APR 93 / Fund manager's global ambitions persist: Invesco MIM's new
team at the top inherit an old strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The architect has gone, but the blueprint has survived his departure. Though
Lord Stevens, who built up Invesco MIM, the London-based fund management
company, left last year, Mr Charles Brady, the American who succeeded him,
harbours the same global ambitions.
When MIM Britannia, chaired by Lord Stevens, acquired the US fund management
businesses of Invesco in 1986, the plan was to create a worldwide investment
group. Even before Invesco MIM became bogged down in a series of
controversies that led to Lord Stevens's departure, the dream was already
fraying at the edges.
The figures tell their own story. In 1986, just after the takeover of
Invesco, the combined company had Pounds 6.4bn under management in the UK
and roughly Pounds 10bn under management elsewhere. At the end of 1992, the
US business held funds under management of Pounds 32.6bn, the UK funds had
shrunk to Pounds 4.3bn and Europe and Japan accounted for just over Pounds
1.3bn each.
Gross profits from the US operations were Pounds 32.9m while the European
and Pacific operations had profits of only Pounds 2.6m before exceptional
write-offs of Pounds 10.1m for the year.
'Invesco MIM is really a US fund management company with a bit of European
business around the edges,' says Mr Philip Gibbs, securities analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Mr Brady, who last week assumed the title of executive chairman, says the
group hopes to put its past troubles behind it and go on to build the
international organisation it had always hoped to be.
Among the company's first priorities, he says, is restoring the confidence
of the UK pension fund consultants who guide the bulk of institutional
business into the hands of fund managers.
That will take time. A clutch of problems remain fresh in UK memories:
Investment performance. Invesco MIM's three-year investment returns - the
figure which fund managers most rely on to sell their services - are
hampered by poor performance in 1990 when it used a 'black box' technique to
select stocks using a US-style active quantitative approach. The approach,
imported wholesale from the US, had been insufficiently tested in the UK,
consultants says.
Regulatory problems. In autumn 1991 Imro, the UK self-regulatory body for
the fund management industry, fined Invesco MIM Pounds 75,000 for
administrative problems with its PEP products. Imro has the firm under
investigation for its role in the handling of transactions from the Mirror
Group Pension Scheme, whose trustees have also filed a writ seeking return
of over Pounds 11m handled by Invesco MIM.
Bad publicity. Recently, Invesco MIM lost the management of one of its
largest investment trusts, Drayton Asia, in a well-publicised fight over
several months. Last year it had to pay Pounds 9.5m to investors in Drayton
Consolidated, another of the investment trusts it managed, after it emerged
that it had breached the trust's own ceiling on the concentration of funds
in a single investment. The firm's reputation has also been hurt by
revelations of its investments in companies of which Lord Stevens was a
director.
Mr Brady says he has moved swiftly, selling off those investments linked to
Lord Stevens and withdrawing from businesses with a high risk profile. That
is why, he says, Invesco is closing down its venture capital division which
has roughly Pounds 600m under management. Talks about a possible management
buy-out are under way.
Mr Norman Riddell, newly appointed chief executive of Invesco's European
operations, says the firm's image is already improving. Several pension
funds have selected it to participate in 'beauty parades' at which fund
managers are selected, he says.
But pension consultants are less upbeat about Invesco's prospects. 'We
haven't been directing clients to them. There's no point,' says a partner at
one of the large actuarial consulting firms. 'We'd have too much explaining
to do.'
While Invesco MIM's performance in 1991 and 1992 has been above average, it
has not been sufficiently spectacular to overcome clients' concerns, he
says.
Mr Gibbs says that even if Invesco MIM is nothing more than a US-based
company its shares, at 104p, still represent good value. It would be well
advised to seek a US listing, he argues, to reflect its true status.
Mr Brady has grander ambitions. The company's UK-based retail operations are
not up for sale, he says, in spite of industry speculation. And he is not
interested in parting from any of the geographical regions in which Invesco
now operates, no matter how marginal the current profitability of those
activities.
In short, Lord Stevens's vision of a global fund management company still
stands.

FT  06 APR 93 / Caradon rises 18% and seeks acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing company, yesterday
announced an 18 per cent profits increase helped by lower interest costs and
improved US productivity.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 125.7m in the year to
December 31 on turnover 2 per cent lower at Pounds 664.4m. At the interim
stage, profits were 28 per cent higher at Pounds 60.6m.
Following last week's sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox
(CMB) for Pounds 473m, Caradon has net cash of Pounds 428m and is looking
for acquisitions. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the company would
favour buying a UK or German-based building products company: 'We want to
broaden our base.'
The company's UK building products division, which includes Everest double
glazing and Mira showers, saw operating profits fall 27 per cent to Pounds
35.2m because of squeezed margins and teething problems at the company's
upgraded radiator factories.
Mr Jansen said there were signs of improvement in the UK, and Everest's
first quarter sales were up 30 per cent over the weak start last year.
In the US, security printing lifted operating profits 23 per cent to Pounds
39m thanks to improved efficiencies.
Overseas building products, which mainly covers European radiator
manufacturing, reported a 26 per cent increase in operating profits mainly
due to improved volumes.
Sales to Germany, the company's most important market, remained buoyant but
the company is cautious about this year.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 20m to Pounds 5.1m after the proceeds of the
Pounds 149m rights issue in November 1991 reduced borrowings.
Year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 44.9m compared with Pounds 40.6 a
year ago, and Pounds 202m at the start of 1991.
The contribution from the CMB stake increased 19 per cent to Pounds 37.7m.
The year-end book value of the stake increased to Pounds 363.1m.
The gain on disposal of the holding, equal to more than Pounds 100m, will be
treated as an exceptional item this year.
Fully-diluted earnings increased 5.3 per cent to 15.8p. The directors
recommended a final dividend of 5.9p to make a total of 8.65p, a 2.6 per
cent increase.

FT  06 APR 93 / Mirror Group Newspapers loses Pounds 84m: Loss blamed on
restructuring as operating profits advance 16% and shares rise 11p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING costs at Mirror Group Newspapers were responsible for a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 84m in the year ended December 27. This compares with
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 47.3m.
But operating profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 97.5m (Pounds 83.7m) on
turnover of Pounds 466.1m (Pounds 459.9m). The shares rose 11p to close at
115p.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive, said: 'Our objective is to be treated
like any other business.'
While reaffirming the Daily Mirror's support for the Labour Party he
attacked what he called the paper's 'cosy culture' between management,
employees and unions: 'In large part this was due to management's failure to
manage.'
Costs were reduced by tackling 'overmanning', reducing part-time casual
staff and reorganising the group's resources.
Profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 47.3m to Pounds 32.5m
after Pounds 17.9m was charged towards refunding the deficit in the group's
pension scheme.
There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 116.5m to meet reorganisation
costs.
These included the rationalisation of the print operations (Pounds 46m),
including the closure of three presses in Stamford Street; the 600 job cuts,
half of which have already been announced (Pounds 16m); and costs associated
with move to a new print site in Glasgow (Pounds 54m).
In addition MGN has provided Pounds 6.4m mainly in respect of continuing
costs relating to the pension fund.
Mr Montgomery acknowledged there had been 'a period of traumatic change' in
promoting 'a new corporate culture' although he denied that industrial
relations at MGN were a problem.
He said those who had left the paper had been unable to embrace the new
'entrepreneurial, enthusiastic spirit'. He said he did not regard the
departure of Lord Hollick, a non-executive director and chairman of MAI
Group, as a loss.
MGN is renegotiating the lease on its Holborn headquarters but may decide to
move to another site. The group's gross debt, including finance leases, was
reduced by Pounds 58m to Pounds 395m.
A loss per share of 19.7p compares with earnings per share of 9.5p. There is
no dividend compared with an 0.8p interim payout last time.

FT  06 APR 93 / Lufthansa in partnership talks with American Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA of Germany is in advanced partnership talks with American
Airlines, one of the 'big three' US carriers.
The negotiations reflect the German carrier's continuing efforts for a
strategic link with a large US carrier to boost its position on the
transatlantic airline market.
Lufthansa, which derives about 30 per cent of its annual revenue from its
North Atlantic routes, has faced particularly fierce competition across the
Atlantic following the acquisition of Pan American's European services,
which include a Frankfurt hub, by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines.
Lufthansa said it was in talks with a number of US carriers, including
American Airlines although in the light of its financial difficulties it was
unlikely to take a share stake in any airline.
American acknowledged that 'at any time, we're talking to any number of
foreign carriers' about partnership arrangements, and said that such
discussions had been stepped up in the wake of the approval for the British
Airways-USAir code-sharing deal.
However, the US carrier stressed that talks were centred on joint marketing
and code-sharing arrangements, and were not likely to involve an equity
investment.
Lufthansa has stepped up its search for a US partner following British
Airways' Dollars 300m (Pounds 198m) investment in USAir and Air France's
co-operation agreement with Air Canada which, in turn, links the French
carrier to Continental Airlines of the US.
Lufthansa is also reacting to merger talks between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. Already, KLM
has a stake in Northwest, of the US, while Delta and Swissair have
cross-equity links.
Lufthansa held talks with both American Airlines and USAir about two years
ago.

FT  06 APR 93 / MMC to probe on-line text retrieval services market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, has
asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to examine the market for
on-line text retrieval services.
The Office of Fair Trading says FT Profile, owned by the Financial Times
Group, has a monopoly share of the UK market for such services.
On-line text retrieval services are typically provided by companies which
store newspaper articles on business and financial subjects on their
computer systems, delivering the information on request to a subscriber's
personal computer.
The OFT claims that Profile is the only database of its kind to be in a
position to offer the full text of the Financial Times: 'Other historical
on-line databases in this market in the UK have to compete without this
important information source because of the FT's copyright licensing
policy,' it says.
The investigation could have significant implications for the interpretation
of copyright law.
It follows 15 months of talks between the OFT and FT Profile. Mr Fred
Perkins, managing director of FT Information Services, said the FT would
co-operate fully with the MMC. He argued, however, that the OFT had taken
too narrow a view of the UK market for on-line services. It had restricted
its analysis to the market for text retrieved from daily and Sunday
newspapers, worth only some Pounds 25m in the UK.
Competitors in the market included FT Profile, the tiny London-based company
Maid Sys-tems and two large North American organisations, Dialog and Mead
Data, both with revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Profile turns over Pounds 12m at present and is just profitable at the
operational level after a 10-year struggle to break into the international
market for full-text electronic information retrieval. It saw itself, Mr
Perkins said, as part of the wider market for on-line business data,
including companies such as Extel and Reuter, worth some Pounds 700m a year
in the UK.
He said the investigation raised fundamental questions about a publisher's
ability to exploit its copyright material in all media and markets. It would
be obviously unfair if a result of the investigation was to require the FT
to make its text freely available to its competitors while being denied the
right to publish electronically, for example, the Wall Street Journal or the
New York Times.

FT  06 APR 93 / Mercedes plans Dollars 300m US plant: Strategy shift aimed
at countering market inroads made by Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car manufacturer, yesterday made a
significant shift in strategy and announced it is to build a new
four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle in the US.
The company is a big manufacturer of heavy trucks in the US, through its
Freightliner subsidiary, but this will be its first car manufacturing
operation in the US and the first on any scale outside Germany.
It will spend Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) to construct a new plant which will
employ 1,500 people by the end of the decade and manufacture up to 60,000
units a year of the new sports utility vehicle.
A site for the plant is to be selected during the next three to four months,
with construction starting by the end of the year and the first vehicles
coming off the production line in 1997.
Mercedes officials would not be drawn on the plant's locations, but there is
widespread speculation that favourite states include North and South
Carolina.
The company is following the lead of German car rival BMW, which last year
broke ground with its first US manufacturing plant, in South Carolina.
Both companies have seen their US sales hit by competition from Japanese
manufacturers, which over the past four years have made huge inroads in the
US luxury car market with keenly priced models.
Up to 40,000 Mercedes vehicles a year will be exported. Some 20,000 will
serve the North American market for sports utility vehicles, which is the
largest in the world and has enjoyed explosive growth over the past decade,
from sales of 240,000 vehicles in 1980 to 1.1m in 1992.
In another strategy shift, Mercedes said its vehicle would not compete in
the luxury segment of the market where the company has traditionally been
strongest.
Its chief US competitors will be vehicles such as Chrysler's Jeep Grand
Cherokee and Ford's Explorer, priced in the Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000
range, rather than Britain's Range Rover at Dollars 40,000.
Mercedes said the vehicle reflects an important shift in product strategy:
to extend its range from the luxury category into premium cars in segments
showing good growth prospects.
Mr Helmut Werner, vice-chairman and chief operating officer, said the new
strategy was a forward-looking, rather than defensive, answer to the
challenge from Japanese manufacturers.
'We will not withdraw into the ivory tower of a 'mega-luxury class' but
rather attack the Japanese competition in its market niches by offering our
own technologically superior product concepts,' Mr Werner said.
However, US production will also be substantially cheaper than in Germany,
where the company faces high labour costs.
Daimler said yesterday that it had also reached agreement after several
years of negotiation to build buses in Russia in partnership with Avtokron,
a Russian manufacturer. The buses are to be built at a plant near Moscow.
Further details will be released in Mannheim on Wednesday.

FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Continental/Pirelli
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pirelli has come out of its Continental adventure rather better than it
deserved. It will not be paid for its Continental shares until December, so
the time value of money means the effective price is less than the DM250 it
claims. But it has still obtained a hefty premium over yesterday's DM204
Continental closing price. That and the devaluation of the lira will produce
a L140bn capital gain this year, although that is also not quite what it
seems. The gain only arises because Pirelli wrote the holding down to a book
value below DM200 a share. Since it originally paid over DM300, it has lost
money overall.
More baffling is the willingness of German institutions to buy Pirelli out
at such an exorbitant price. The triumphalism of the finance minister of
Lower Saxony suggests political pressures for a German solution were
paramount. Nord/LB will finance its part of the rescue by issuing a bond
convertible into Continental shares. But Continental paid no dividend for
1991, which raises questions about how it will cover the 6 per cent interest
cost.
Much of the deal remains obscure, in stark contrast to the more open
corporate culture heralded by Daimler-Benz's New York listing. Pirelli's
effort to grab control of Continental provided Germany with an incentive to
introduce full shareholder democracy with the parallel safeguard of a
takeover code. It is a pity that Deutsche Bank, which should have the best
interests of the country's financial system at heart, orchestrated such an
old-fashioned solution.

FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Morgan Crucible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Crucible will find the brave new accounting world a hostile place.
Yesterday's Pounds 61.3m pre-tax profit was struck after Pounds 18.6m fair
value provisions against acquisitions. If the Accounting Standards Board
gets its way, such costs will in future be charged against profits. Having
already restated 1991 profits downwards in accordance with FRS3, Morgan may
have to break out the red ink once again. Yet its predilection for
acquisition accounting comes as no surprise. Yesterday's 11 per cent fall in
the shares reflects deeper concerns.
The expiry of its self-imposed moratorium on rights issues prompts the
question of how Morgan will fund itself. The Pounds 55m cash outflow last
year suggests internal resources will provide, at best, a partial solution.
Even allowing for the effect of exchange rates on the company's dollar debt,
67 per cent gearing leaves little leeway for borrowing. The sale of Holt
Lloyd and other businesses might yield Pounds 60m this year. The suspicion
remains that the market will be asked to put up additional capital before
long.
That will be difficult to justify while operating margins are being
squeezed. Exposure to continental Europe and the automotive industries
suggest a tough 1993, even though sterling's devaluation and Morgan's
position as a low-cost producer will help offset these pressures. But
without any organic earnings growth beneath the accounting mulch,
shareholders should feel under no obligation to dig deep on the company's
behalf.

FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, the money supply figures had a reassuring message for the
gilts market. Overseas investors bought over Pounds 1bn in gilts in
February, the largest monthly total for nearly two years. Yet it would be
rash to assume that buying will be sustained at this level.
February was remarkable in two ways: sterling fell to nearly DM2.30 and the
gilts market was supported, particularly at the short end, by expectations
of lower interest rates. The first made gilts attractive to those prepared
to bet on the currency recovering from what appeared an abnormally low
level. The second, which was probably a more significant influence, held out
the promise of capital gain. Even investors worried about sterling falling
further could hedge themselves by financing their holding at a profit with
cheap short-term money. The main factor behind overseas purchases appears to
have been such hedged buying by Japanese and US investors.
On neither ground is the market so attractive now. Sterling has recovered,
limiting the room for further currency profits. Talk of base rate cuts has
faded. In the six months since sterling left the ERM, overseas investors
have made net gilt purchases of only Pounds 600m, despite a 1.6 percentage
point fall in 10-year yields. On the other hand, the political crisis in
Italy and high real UK yields compared with those in Germany are now
sparking some interest from the continent. And yesterday's other monetary
data - promising moderate recovery without significant inflationary pressure
 -should help underpin prices.

FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: A polished mirror
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers' ability to generate headlines in other people's
publications remains undiminished. But while its management has been loudly
lambasted for its rough handling of cherished columnists, it has been
quietly winning a following in the City. The stock market has scented a real
recovery story beneath the drama. Since being relisted, MGN's shares have
more than doubled. They rose 11 per cent after yesterday's annual results.
With operating profits up 16 per cent to Pounds 97.5m and margins widening
from 18 per cent to 21 per cent, the appeal is easy to understand. A 9 per
cent growth in advertising revenue this year and suspiciously large
exceptional reorganisation provisions of Pounds 116m suggest there is
further growth to come. The administrators doubtless hope this will help
them dispose of their 54.8 per cent holding at a handsome price, possibly
through a placing.
The trouble is that MGN's trading improvements may simply reflect the smack
of firm management following its unfortunate distractions. Once the
immediate recovery story has run its course, doubts may resurface about the
group's debt, dividend and long-term direction. It will be difficult for MGN
to reduce year-end borrowings of Pounds 395m, suggesting another passed
dividend this year.
The task will be made all the harder by the fall in the Daily Mirror's
circulation following last July's price rise. Given the current hostilities
in the tabloid market, it will be difficult to recover sales.

FT  06 APR 93 / Trustees try to protect coal pension fund surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of British Coal's staff pension scheme have asked the company to
set aside nearly a third of the scheme's Pounds 1bn surplus to guarantee
inflation-proofed pensions for members indefinitely.
If British Coal agrees, it will make the scheme much more expensive for the
government to fund if, as believed, its privatisation plans for British Coal
include an offer to take over funding of the scheme for current and deferred
pensioners, in exchange for receiving its assets. A similar proposal has
been made to British Rail's pension scheme.
In recent years, pensions have been increased in line with inflation but
scheme rules do not require that trustees automatically approve such
increases.
Following the staff scheme's most recent actuarial valuation, the trustees
proposed that Pounds 300m from the surplus be set aside to fund index-linked
pensions and to cover the scheme's loss of dividend income due to advance
corporation tax changes.
They also proposed that Pounds 470m be spent on improving pension terms for
scheme members. The rest of the surplus will be earmarked for further
British Coal contributions holidays.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that British Coal has offered to make the
trustees a temporary interest-free 'loan' of a disputed Pounds 452m sum,
intended to represent a deferred payment to cover enhanced pensions for
redundant members of the staff scheme.
Trustees had agreed several years ago to allow British Coal to defer making
the payment until it actually became necessary to pay pensions, although the
sum is recognised as a liability in British Coal's latest accounts.
But six weeks ago, the Department of Trade and Industry asked British Coal
to consider taking the payment out of its share of the scheme surplus.
British Coal, after consulting its lawyers, has tentatively agreed. After
the current contributions holiday ends in 1997, the payment would use up all
British Coal's share of the surplus.
Trustees say they will challenge the move in court on the grounds that the
trust deed bars British Coal from taking funds out in any way other than
through a contributions holiday.
Yesterday Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow energy spokesman, said he had asked the
DTI to explain its involvement in seeking to strip the staff scheme of its
surplus.

FT  06 APR 93 / Best US shot for Boris:  Yeltsin leaves Vancouver facing a
daunting agenda. Clinton departs to plaudits / Assessing the summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summits, like wars, have variable shelf lives. There is no way of predicting
with certainty whether Vancouver constitutes a new dawn or a futile gesture
or just a middling step along a rocky road for Russian-American relations.
Mr Bill Clinton's presidency may not rise or fall on it in the longer term,
but, as a first foreign exercise for a man just 10 weeks in office and
supposedly innocent in the ways of the world, it was an important early
test, in which he may be graded positively or negatively.
The former case, on balance now the stronger, is as follows. He contrived to
present a substantial and substantive bilateral assistance package to Russia
that, far from increasing America's domestic overdraft, inventively taps
only existing resources, while holding out to the US private sector at least
the prospect of lucrative new business. He thoroughly asserted his
leadership over the other leading industrialised nations in the common
effort to stop Russia slipping back into the hostile abyss, cajoling Japan,
consulting Europe and exerting discreet pressure on the international
financial institutions.
He artfully co - opted a carping Congress into the co - operative effort by
persuading the bipartisan leadership of the House of Representatives to go
for a personal tour of inspection to Russia. He laid the ground for his
domestic salesmanship with a very well constructed pre-summit speech
squarely placing Russian reform in the US vital interest.
And, on top of all this, he seems to have impressed Boris Yeltsin, both with
his mastery of the complex issues on the table and with his almost feline
deference to Russian sensibilities. He adopted a conciliatory stance
regarding the recent collision in the Barents Sea between Russian and
American submarines. He allowed the legitimacy of Russian complaints that
some restrictive cold war legislation still on the US statute books ought no
longer to be applied to a post-communist nation embarked, however haltingly,
on the road to democratic and market-oriented reform: and he offered, above
all, not charity but partnership.
Obviously, the post-cold war rules of international relationships are still
sketchy. But Mr Clinton's commitment to, and fascination with, change, so
evident at home, are clearly going to be applied overseas. It is
inconceivable that either of his predecessors - Ronald Reagan, sticking to
his lines and his core beliefs, and George Bush, revelling in the
camaraderie of the international leadership club for its own sake but
faithful to it to a fault - could have displayed such inventiveness and
intellectual grasp. Yet, like them, he has secured a commitment from Moscow
to co-operate as far as possible across the foreign policy board.
On this scorecard, Vancouver may be seen as a triumph. Even allowing for his
preference for substance over form, he managed also to appear thoroughly
presidential. This may have come as less of a surprise to those who have
observed him closely over the past two months, but it certainly impressed
the legions of Russian and foreign correspondents who descended on
Vancouver. There were many favourable contrasts with the relative paucity of
current European and Japanese leadership.
The critical case turns most of the above arguments upside down, with
twists. The fundamental objection is that, no matter what distinctions he
draws between Mr Yeltsin the man and the reform process in general, Mr
Clinton is betting too much on the Russian president.
They had seemed an unlikely pair, the southern meritocrat fascinated with
policy intricacies and the Russian strongman of the thumping fists. But if
they struck a genuine personal rapport, as they said they did, two poor boys
from humble backgrounds with strong populist traits, then the loss of Mr
Yeltsin might even be more grievous for the US president.
He has said, after all, that he wants to depersonalise international
policies: to him Saddam Hussein of Iraq is not the villain he was to George
Bush. But the American psyche, very much manifest in this thoroughly modern
president, does personalise relations and Mr Clinton is proud of his ability
to relate to people.
Whether he likes it or not, and almost regardless of his policies, the loss
of Mr Yeltsin would, in the US perspective, hurt Mr Clinton, whereas he
would get less credit for helping to 'save' him. It could also undermine the
credibility of his attempts to cut the US budget deficit, in good part
dependent on taking a large bite out of defence.
The second indictment is that he underestimates the intractability of
Russia's economic problems. Mr Clinton is a natural born interventionist,
but his laboratories so far have been familiar and domestic. Talking about
the need for a responsible Russian monetary policy is far easier than
bringing the central bank to heel. The reservations, so evident in Japan,
that trying to aid Russia is pouring money down a drain have powerful
adherents in the US.
Thirdly, all presidential protestations to the contrary, there is just the
hint of financial and political legerdemain about the US assistance package,
which is suddenly larger than had been expected. Switching food credits
around assorted agricultural programmes may help US farm exports but it
looks slick at a time when fiscal responsibility is supposed to be the
domestic rule.
Holding out the promise of more from Congress, and getting it to repeal
those trade restrictions Russia finds objectionable, may be easier said than
done, especially when the domestic constituency for bailing out foreigners
is so weak. The promise of many of the micro-programmes, such as student
exchanges and energy efficiency assistance, will not be redeemed in a hurry.
The final question is whether Mr Clinton can keep the G7 and the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank in line, let alone additionally
tap the Saudi pocket. For there is this nagging problem, which he freely
concedes, about the imperative of appropriate Russian policies being put in
place. Without them, not only the Japanese may baulk.
The president keeps saying that only the Russians can 'save' Russian
democracy. But at least in Vancouver he gave it his own, very distinctive,
best shot.

FT  06 APR 93 / Leading Article: Russia after the summit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE WORLD cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia replicated in a
nation as big as Russia, spanning 11 time zones with an arsenal of nuclear
weapons that is still very vast.' Thus did President Clinton explain the
importance of the subjects under discussion with President Yeltsin over the
weekend. But they were no less important a year ago when actions now being
contemplated by western leaders might have made faster reform feasible. The
west chose to be timid when it should have been bold. Now it may be too
late.
A legally justified anarchy obtains in Russia. Unhappily, it is likely to
endure. Mr Yeltsin is likely to win a majority of those voting in the
plebiscite of April 25. That would give him the moral victory, but it would
not give him the unquestioned authority he needs to implement reforms, for
which he must obtain a majority of those registered to vote.
The west cannot directly influence the outcome, though its moral support
must help. Should Mr Yeltsin win either a decisive victory or merely a moral
one, western assistance will be essential.
First, the West cannot offer just one kind of assistance. There will have to
be humanitarian relief, technical assistance and project finance. But there
must also be help with economic stabilisation. Without a currency worth
earning, a budget that can be closed without use of the printing press, and
a social safety net, assistance will largely be wasted.
Second, aid must be coordinated more effectively. The summit decision to
establish a G7 coordinating office in Moscow is welcome and overdue.
Third, substantial assistance will be needed to make stabilisation even
conceivable. With its proposed temporary financing facility to help Russia
and other former Soviet republics 'facing particularly disruptive systemic
shocks', the IMF seems to have recognised at last that the orthodox approach
is not workable in the former Soviet Union.
Fourth, Russia will need markets. But access to western markets is in the
interest of the west as well, since Russia will export in order to import.
The European Community should reach generous free trade agreements with all
the countries of the former Soviet Union as quickly as possible.
Finally, President Clinton needs to remember his own words about the
security threat posed by Russia. Dollars 900m of the Dollars 1.6bn he
offered is merely disguised assistance to US farm exports. Help for Russia
should be seen as an alternative to western military spending. It is only in
this context that assistance on the required scale could be justified
without sacrificing the interests of other, arguably worthier recipients.
President Clinton has shown he is aware of the seriousness of the challenge.
That is a welcome start. The G7 must now show the determination to help take
Russian reform forward.

   EDUCATION IS a people business
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
delivering the product depends on the willing co-operation of the teachers.
In seeking to raise the quality of education in UK schools, the government
has neglected this essential truth and failed to cultivate the profession's
support. The result is that progress on much-needed reforms could be stalled
by the overwhelming opposition of the teachers.
The present difficulties arise from the introduction of the national
curriculum and compulsory tests at seven, 11 and 14. The former has a useful
role to play in setting benchmark standards for schools, especially in basic
skills and core knowledge. It can also reduce unnecessary diversity in what
is taught across the country, an obstacle to educational achievement for
children who move home during schooling.
Compulsory testing was originally seen as a diagnostic tool, to help
teachers identify under-achievers. A second objective was then imposed:
tests would be used to judge school performance. The first objective
requires complicated tests to determine individual achievement in a range of
skills. The second needs national tests so that schools can be fairly
compared. The result has been complicated, national tests, requiring a
complicated national curriculum to sustain them.
Thus the national curriculum has become hopelessly overladen, reaching into
almost every minute of the school day. In some subjects, it falls into the
twin traps of being insufficiently challenging for academic children, while
neglecting the basic skills others need for the world of work. And it is far
too prescriptive, insisting, for example, that every 14-year-old child read
one of three named Shakespeare plays.
Teachers and their unions have been in the forefront of pointing out that
the curriculum and the testing have become unwieldy. However, successive
education secretaries have ignored their protests, because the unions have
in the past obstructed reform. They have thus ignored legitimate objections,
many shared by those who have in the past supported the government's
reforms. This has allowed a teachers' boycott of testing to gather support
that threatens the whole programme.
Mr John Patten, the latest education secretary, was relying on the courts to
enforce the law that makes testing compulsory. On Friday, the High Court
failed to come to his aid, ruling that the boycotts were legitimate
industrial action. Mr Patten has no alternative but to talk to the teachers
if he wishes to secure their goodwill to allow testing to continue.
Because the discontent has been allowed to fester, it may take more than
minor concessions to achieve this. At the very least, Mr Patten must come
forward with proposals to reduce the scope of the national curriculum and
simplify testing if his strategic aim of clearer, higher standards and
better performance among schools is not to be jeopardised.

If you really want to catch Lord Hanson's ear, whistle an old Nat King Cole
number, or better still get him to talk about his days in the British Forces
Broadcasting Service. Lord Hanson may be rather shy when it comes to giving
interviews but the BFBS's Richard Astbury had no difficulty getting him to
go on the record about his days as a forces disc jockey for tonight's Radio
2 programme 'Forces Gold'.
It all dates back to February 1945 when Captain James Hanson of the Duke of
Wellington's regiment arrived in Athens. Having helped put down a communist
uprising, Hanson bumped into Leslie Perowne, a radio star of that era, who
asked him if he fancied spinning a few of his records on the turntable.
Hanson didn't need to be asked twice and struck up a close friendship with
Perowne.
Apart from convincing Hanson that he ought to set up his own radio station
one day, Perowne taught him a few presentational tricks which have helped
Hanson 'enormously in business'. Given that Astbury had to condense BFBS's
50-year history into 58 minutes, most of Lord Hanson's remarks have ended up
on the cutting-room floor. Apparently, Lord H waxed quite lyrically about
his friendship with Frank Sinatra whom he entertains at his Palm Springs
hideaway.

The first public outing of the new team running ITN, which supplies

been a happier occasion than it was.
David Gordon, 51, the new chief executive who has just jumped ship from The
Economist, acknowledged that he did not know much about television but knew
a lot of people who do; ITN stalwart Stewart Purvis, 45, recently promoted
to editor in chief, positively bristled when one hack asked about rumours of
internal disciplinary hearings concerning expenses irregularities; and
Michael Green, 45, the UK's latest rising media boss and ITN chairman,
brushed aside a follow-up question on possible staff cuts.
'The days when you could write about 'the troubled ITN' are gone,' stressed
Purvis. Another over-hasty news judgment, perhaps?

The search for Barclays Bank's new chief executive has only just begun, yet
long-time Barclays Bank watchers sense that the real power struggle between
Barclays Bank chairman Andrew Buxton and his deputy, ex-Treasury chief Sir
Peter Middleton, is also in its infancy.
For an executive who has been on board less than 18 months, Sir Peter has
assumed a surprisingly powerful role at Barclays. It is not just the
prominence of his picture in the annual report - normally Barclays' chairmen
are pictured solo - but the size of the share options granted to Sir Peter
which catch the eye. He has more than any other executive.
The conventional wisdom is that Sir Peter's route to the top of Barclays has
been blocked by chairman Andrew Buxton's decision to split the top job and
hire a new chief executive. Bringing in an outsider undermines the need for
a strong executive deputy chairman.
Is Sir Peter, who has just turned 59 and is five years older than Buxton,
destined to serve out the rest of his days as a loyal number two at
Barclays? Given that he was beaten to the top job in the civil service by
his younger ex-colleague, Sir Robin Butler, and also missed out on the
governorship of the Bank of England, it would be odd if Sir Peter didn't
secretly dream of crowning his career with the chairmanship of a big London
clearing bank.
After all, if Sir Nicholas Goodison and Sir Christopher Tugendhat can be
given bank chairmanships, why not Sir Peter? But the clock is ticking and
unless Sir Peter moves soon the prize may escape him. How he must envy his
other ex-Treasury colleague, Sir David Walker, Lloyds Bank's new deputy
chairman.
Sir David, 53, is a dozen years younger than his chairman, Sir Robin Ibbs,
who turns 67 this month. If Sir David keeps his head down, the chairmanship
of Britain's premier bank should soon be in his grasp. The irony is that Sir
Peter would probably be a more popular choice as a clearing bank chairman,
in some quarters of the City, than Sir David.

FT  06 APR 93 / Back to the task of Russia's future: Yeltsin leaves
Vancouver facing a daunting agenda. Clinton departs to plaudits / Assessing
the summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After his weekend meeting with Bill Clinton in Vancouver, Boris Yeltsin is
returning to Moscow secure in the knowledge that he has the American
president's unequivocal support. Assistance for the Yeltsin reform programme
has now been enshrined in the Clinton declaration that it is 'the highest
duty of all the western democracies' to come to Russia's aid.
Vancouver was time out, and Mr Yeltsin looked and sounded the better for it.
It was a little over a day and a half of lavish hospitality, high praise and
smooth Canadian organisation which the Russian delegation accepted
gratefully, if a little forlornly. Now comes the more difficult part, when
the weary Russian president has to take on the tricky tasks at home vital to
his political survival.
Mr Yeltsin must first present the weekend's summit as a victory. That may
prove more difficult than might be thought after securing a pledge of
Dollars 1.6bn from the US (plus nearly another Dollars 400m pledged by
Canada and Britain before Vancouver) and the promise of a multi-billion
dollar package from Group of Seven leading industrialised nations before the
end of the month. The problem is that such aid is regarded sceptically by
many Russians and with hostility by Mr Yeltsin's opponents. Reactions range
from doubt that it will be forthcoming to feelings of humiliation - a
sentiment which Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Mr Yeltsin's increasingly
obstructive prime minister, expressed in a pre-summit interview.
The president has been assisted in this presentational task by the cunning
construction of the US package. It is, as Mr Yeltsin said on Sunday, a plan
which accentuates co-operative aspects and stresses what each economy can do
for the other.
However, Mr Yeltsin must keep his political balance until the April 25
referendum, which will measure popular support for his continued leadership,
his economic proposals and for holding early presidential and parliamentary
elections.
As Mr Clinton's aides have pointed out, the president has done little or no
campaigning recently, beyond rather tense TV appearances at times of high
drama. Upon his return from Vancouver, he must immediately take his case
directly to the people, in the way he did so effectively nearly two years
ago when he secured the presidency. He is immeasurably more tired than he
was then and may be discouraged, but he has no choice if he is to emerge
with a popular mandate.
Yeltsin must also make clear what he will consider a victory in the
referendum. Under the rules which the parliament proposed, it will require
50 per cent of the voting public not just to turn out, but to register
assent for Yeltsin's propositions, before he can claim a victory. This is
highly unlikely even with the tide turning in his favour.
If the Constitutional Court does not rule this stipulation unconstitutional,
then the Russian president faces a difficult choice. He must be prepared to
ignore the court's decision and present a majority vote for himself as
sufficient basis for a claim of victory, or he must revert to his original
idea of holding his own vote, free of such qualifications.
In any case, the Russian people must be made fully aware of what they are
voting for, and what the stakes are. Mr Yeltsin said on Sunday that these
stakes were formidably high - nothing less than the preservation and
extension of freedom itself. The president will need to bring that message
from Vancouver to Vladivostok, Voronezhh and Volgograd.
If he wins the referendum, Yeltsin has no choice but to capitalise upon it
immediately. He must resist the temptation to disengage himself from
government as he did after his triumph over the attempted coup of August
1991. What is needed most urgently is for Yeltsin to implement the G7
funding package expected to be put before him after the group's finance and
foreign ministers meet in Tokyo later this month.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance,
said on Sunday that 'everything depends on April 25'. Decisions on the
control of the central bank and the bankruptcy of state enterprises await
its outcome. A plan is ready, but the political support is lacking.
Victory in the referendum must also be followed by the introduction of a
constitution which clearly defines the balance of powers between president
and parliament and allows both to develop effective and complementary
responsibilities. This will surely be a long process as it has been
elsewhere, including the US, where there was a gap of 13 years between the
signing of the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the
constitution.
Russia, however, cannot wait a decade and survive in one piece. There must
be a workable resolution which will preserve the fissiparous federation and
allow reasonably effective government in the short term.
Mr Yeltsin must also define clearly his country's relationships with the
other former Soviet states. These are currently in disarray. Russia cannot
continue to advance credits to its neighbours as if they were its own
regions. It must force them, in effect, to adopt their own currencies. At
the same time it cannot treat them as political punch-bags to be battered
whenever attention needs to be diverted from the faltering Russian economy.
There must be a coldly rational process of defining national interests - but
one which recognises interdependence among the former Soviet republics.
The final task facing Mr Yeltsin is to provide a sense of hope to the
Russian people, in whom he has placed his trust. In the past he tried and
failed to provide a sense of optimism with unrealistic promises of rapid
economic improvement. Instead he must use exhortation, example and openness.
'There is no alternative to me,' he said in Vancouver. 'There will be
tomorrow, but not today.'
But that will only be true if he makes himself indispensable to reform. Only
if President Yeltsin nurtures the soil on which a worthy successor can grow
will he be able to hand over power peacefully and with a sense of
achievement.

NUMEROUS ACADEMIC studies have found either that takeovers fail to generate
efficiency gains, or that the evidence of such gains is inconclusive. Yet
Britain has seen successive takeover booms in which the number and value of
acquisitions have risen inexorably. While there is no single explanation of
this paradox, the extreme laxity of acquisition accounting is unquestionably
one of the more important. So much the better, then, that the Accounting
Standards Board (ASB) is now embarking on an overdue clean-up. But as ASB
chairman Mr David Tweedie is well aware, the power of the vested interests
involved in the takeover industry is such that this could prove a make or
break affair for accountancy's promising new regulatory framework.
The laxity stems from the scope granted under existing rules to an acquiring
company to attribute new, 'fair' values to the assets and liabilities of the
acquired company. There is a temptation, first, to write down the value of
the acquired company's stock to unrealistically low levels, then to make
provisions in advance for loosely specified rationalisation and
reorganisation costs, bad debts, repairs and sundry other items. The effect
is to increase the figure of goodwill arising on acquisition, which most
predators immediately write off against reserves, and to boost profits
artifically in subsequent years.
Existing practice has, then, offered an open invitation to management to
write its own profit figures. A growing market in corporate control has made
the business of trading in companies seem an easy alternative to generating
increased revenues from goods and services in a mature economy. The
beneficiaries have been the managers of predatory companies, whose
remuneration has risen to reflect growing assets and earnings; and bankers
and brokers who have benefited from increased market activity in the City,
two of whose leading institutions, the Bank of England and the London Stock
Exchange, are among the ASB's ultimate paymasters. The losers have been
shareholders, especially those in the acquiring companies, and the wider
economy.
The ASB will come under powerful attack from those sectors of industry whose
illusory profits are threatened and from the City, where real profits are at
stake. It is therefore important that the government, the Confederation of
British Industry and the ASB's own backers in the City recognise that the
reforms will not distort legitimate business activity. They constitute an
attempt to remove existing distortions that result from a wholly
inappropriate set of incentives for company management. As takeover activity
has increased, the economic significance of those distortions has become
greater. The ASB deserves every support in promoting a supply-side reform
whose technicality belies its considerable importance to the economy.

FT  06 APR 93 / Banks dial M for money: The growth of telephone banking in
the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In many ways, British banks use technology in a primitive fashion. Yet a
trail of visitors to a nondescript industrial estate on the outskirts of
Leeds indicates one exception. This is the sole office of a bank whose
customers carry out their transactions by telephone. It is an experiment
which is being watched closely by rivals.
Firstdirect is the part of Midland Bank that most excited Mr John Bond,
chief executive of HSBC Holdings following its acquisition of the UK bank
last summer. Three years after it was founded, other retail banks have
stopped dismissing Firstdirect as too clever by half. Instead, they are
defending themselves against it as it adds 12,000 to its 350,000 customers
each month.
This year is likely to mark a turning point for telephone banking in a
market which has relied on dense branch networks. National Westminster Bank
has launched a pilot telephone bank called PrimeLine; TSB is trying out a
telephone service along with branches in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Royal Bank of
Scotland is mulling a national service for its 800 branches.
Those involved enthuse about the potential for telephone banking in a
country that had been thought too conservative to accept it. 'It is very
simple to introduce, and it is not a huge capital investment,' says Mr Mike
Summers of TSB. 'We think it will grow dramatically through the 1990s,' says
Mr Larry Cattle, NatWest's head of customer relationships.
The change of mood is prompted by a decline in the use of Britain's 12,000
bank branches. On average, bank customers visited a branch only 2.2 times a
month last year compared with 2.6 times in 1991, according to an NOP survey.
About 2m bank customers now seek account information and carry out bank
transactions by telephone or by computer.
Mr Kevin Newman, chief executive of Firstdirect, estimates that between 10
and 20 per cent of UK bank customers could switch to telephone banks.
Firstdirect takes 12,000 calls in 24 hours; an average of 1.2 from each
customer per month. Customers use Midland teller machines to obtain cash,
but otherwise make transactions by telephone and post.
The cost savings are substantial. Firstdirect's cost to income ratio remains
above banks with branch networks because it has relatively few customers. Mr
Newman estimates, however, that as its customer base grows, it may get down
to between 40 and 45 per cent, compared with Midland's current ratio of 68
per cent. 'I don't see how branch banks will be able to compete with us,' he
says.
An even bigger potential strength of telephone banks is in generation of
income. By careful marketing, and sifting of applications, Firstdirect has
acquired a customer base of rich potential. It has proved attractive to
professional employees with limited time to visit branches, and enough
disposable income to buy other products such as insurance.
'They are not just yuppies. The appeal is far broader than even we
expected,' says Mr Newman. Some three quarters of his customers are aged
between 25 and 45; most are 'considerably up-market'; and 40 per cent are
women. Affluent customers, he says, are less likely to stick with their old
bank through inertia.
Firstdirect is thus squeezing other banks in two ways. It is taking away
some of their best customers - three quarters of its customers are being
acquired from outside Midland. And its low cost base means it may be able to
hold out indefinitely against introducing charges on accounts in credit.
Small wonder that others are rushing to defend themselves. The most direct
imitation of Firstdirect so far is NatWest's PrimeLine. As yet, this is
tiny, aiming to recruit only 9,000 customers this year. But, like
Firstdirect, it is aiming its service at upmarket customers; it has even
gone a stage further by offering each customer a personal manager.
One advantage is that NatWest may be able to use PrimeLine to retain
customers when it shuts a branch. It is expected to cut 100 branches a year
during the next three years in an attempt to cut costs. 'A bank with a
telephone subsidiary may manage to switch over some good customers it would
otherwise lose,' says Mr Graham Gould, of the financial services consultant
Coba-MID.
Yet most British banks are opting for a different model. Rather than having
separate telephone banking subsidiaries, they are setting up support
services for existing branches. That is the type of telephone banking
already established in US banks such as Wells Fargo in California and which
has been studied by Royal Bank of Scotland.
Smaller retail banks such as Co-operative Bank and Girobank have already set
up telephone services to support small branch networks. Banks with large
branch networks now face a tricky calculation. Most of them are cutting
branches to trim costs, and must work out whether a telephone service will
help that process, or merely add another layer of expense.
The extent to which banks can reduce costs by combining telephone services
with branch networks is, however, still unclear. Both Girobank and the
Co-operative Bank have high cost income ratios compared with others: the
Co-op's ratio is 75 per cent. 'Some people think of telephone banking as a
low cost delivery channel, but often you just add another layer of costs,'
says Mr Gould.
For this reason, TSB has proceeded cautiously by setting up an experiment in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne this month. It is using what it calls an 'umbrella'
24-hour banking service to support a slimmed-down branch network. Out of 30
branches, it has closed eight, and 'semi-automated' seven others by
replacing staff with teller machines providing basic services.
TSB thinks this may ease the cost constraints facing telephone banking by
cutting branch costs at the same time. 'I think people need some bricks and
mortar in their bank, but I don't think they need a lot, and certainly not
as much as they used to,' says Mr Summers, TSB's marketing director.
A second imponderable facing potential entrants to telephone banking is
income generation. Mr Newman argues that customers are more receptive to
being sold products by telephone banks because they have set time aside to
ring, and are not standing in a branch queue. Firstdirect calculates that
its accounts are on average worth 15 per cent more than in branch banks with
similar customer profiles.
Yet it may be hard for others to repeat this. Firstdirect's customers - many
of them young professionals - are of a generation happy to conduct business
by telephone. It could be trickier for branch banks to persuade their older
customers to switch from face-to-face contact to telephones.
Such obstacles are unlikely to stem the flow of visitors to Firstdirect. Mr
Bond has sent word to HSBC subsidiaries to come and see it. 'I find
Firstdirect exciting. It is a classic case of finding a new way of reaching
customers,' he says. But it is still unclear how many want to be reached
this way.

FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: A fair day's work for a fair day's pay is a textbook
concept 30 years old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GILLIAN STAMP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, An article by Adrian Furnham ('Moving tale of a fair day's work', March
24) has been brought to my attention.
As a follow-up to his interesting article about equity in the world of work,
you and he may be interested to know that a theory of equity in employment
studies was first published by Elliott Jaques more than 30 years ago. I
quote from Equitable Payment (1961): 'There exist shared social norms of
what constitutes a fair or equitable payment for any given level of work,
these norms being intuitively known by each individual. The totality of
these norms constitutes a pattern of equitable differential payment for
differentials in level of work carried.'
Jaques' research led him to the same view as Professor Furnham that 'people
at work need to feel fairly, equitably rewarded . . . and not everybody in a
state of inequity feels it because they are underbenefited, some . . . feel
it because they are over benefited.'
Jaques' approach to equity went beyond reward to what he called 'the
work-reward-capacity nexus.' His research - and my own during the last 18
years - has shown that in addition to their intuitive sense of equity in
reward, people have a similar sense of equity in the level of responsibility
of their work and the level they feel capable of carrying.
Further research into and application of the work-reward-capacity nexus has
continued at the Brunel Institute for Organisation and Social Studies for
the 25 years.
It has led to the development of 'career path appreciation' - a procedure
for evaluating the current and potential capacity to make those decisions at
work that do not make themselves. The need arises when the facts cannot be
known, because they are not available, or because there is no time to search
for them. In a social and business environment of mounting uncertainty, this
quality - commonly described as 'judgment' - is of the essence.
Career path appreciation transcends gender, race, education and is widely
used throughout the world to realise equity in the work-reward-capacity
nexus.

FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Channel rail link will put commuters last in line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M H FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Final search for the missing link: the case for the
Channel tunnel rail link is persuasive, but who will fund it?' (March 31),
Richard Tomkins paints the 'embarrassing' picture of 'high-speed
international expresses from Paris and Brussels' which will find themselves
having to queue 'behind British Rail commuter trains' for access to London.
Can he be really serious?
Any regular user of British Rail knows that it will be the commuter that has
to queue.
I feel a dose of reality therapy is required for Mr Tomkins.
Perhaps you could get him to use his journalistic talents to establish what
the likely fare at today's prices for the journey on the high-speed link
from the tunnel to London might be.

FT  06 APR 93 / Major's secret agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of us fancy that when - if - the British government regains its balance
its true nature will be revealed. We will at last perceive that the
administration that was formed after the downfall of the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in 1990 is centrist, with a tendency to dabble in the red arts of
the social and interventionist left. As President George Bush moved away
from the Reagan right, so Mr John Major is likely to detach himself from
Thatcherism. That is the conventional wisdom among Tories of the cast of
mind that was once called 'wet'.
It is almost certainly wrong. The prime minister's secret agenda, which is
an open book, is to survive. Events will determine his policies. Each
decision will be carefully weighed. Does it help the government regain its
authority? Will the backbenches have it? Only proposals that produce a 'yes'
to both questions will pass.
Mr Major is not made of the material with which the heavens construct
self-confident leaders, those who stand at the front of the column, feet
astride, arm out pointing the way ahead. There is no evidence that he is an
original political thinker possessed of a strong sense of direction. If he
developed into a giant of that kind it would be the biggest surprise since
the Americans unwrapped Mr Harry Truman and found a great president inside.
To observe as much is not to disregard the prime minister's considerable
strengths. His character is by now familiar. He is decent, and nobody's
fool. He is more impressive in private conclave than in public. He is
dogged, sometimes recklessly stubborn; if he is not a source of popular
inspiration then at least he is a man who draws inspiration from his party.
In common with several of his senior ministers - the chancellor springs to
mind - he is more responsive to the advice given by civil servants than were
either Lady Thatcher or some of her prominent colleagues. Like President
Bill Clinton, the prime minister is a policy 'wonk'; unlike the new occupant
of the White House, he is a wader through options rather than a salesman of
change.
This weekend Mr Major will celebrate the first anniversary of the 1992
general election, a contest in which he achieved a victory that he
understandably describes as 'sweet'. Yet it went sour very quickly. Over the
past year the Tories have been sorely divided, so much so that we have
enjoyed the delights of coalition government within a system designed to
provide stable, strong, stultifying, single-party administrations. The task
that this ordinary chap in an extraordinary job has set himself for his
second year as elected prime minister is clear. He will be the healer of
wounds, the party leader who reunites the Conservatives.
If you follow the argument so far, you may agree that what fate has in store
for our anti-hero is to plonk his administration firmly down on Thatcher
territory. The first act of healing will be to pump the hands and squeeze
the shoulders of all but the most recalcitrant of the Maastricht rebels.
Yes, I know that the squabble isn't over yet (I'll come to the Danish
referendum in a moment), but we must assume that it will be and that the
prime minister will have his treaty. If he does not - if the Maastricht bill
is defeated in parliament - there will be no Mr Major to discuss, except as
a pensioned-off previous occupant of No 10 Downing Street.
Let us take it, therefore, that the prime minister gets to the other side of
the Maastricht debate, either with his bill or, if the Danes vote 'no' a
second time, without it but with his job intact. In either circumstance his
European policy will be to pre-empt the next intergovernmental conference of
the member states of the European Community (in the case of a Danish upset)
or the European Union (post-Maastricht).
In short Mr Major will seek to set the agenda for Europe. Position papers
are already being prepared. As the supposedly Europhile Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, has indicated, this is likely to reinforce the concept of
the Community or European Union as a congeries of independent nation-states,
although the Germans can be expected to renew their efforts to create a true
federation.
Britain, which will be outside the exchange rate mechanism and nowhere near
approaching an opt-in to monetary union, will be governed by a Conservative
party whose leaders are united in their new-found Euro-scepticism, or, if
you prefer greater precision, anti-federalism. The prime minister will be at
the heart of Europe, but he may yet break Europe's heart.
Domestic policy is likewise Thatcher-led. There is apparently no limit to
privatisation. The previous prime minister shrank from denationalising coal,
the railways, the post office. Mr Major proposes to make plc's of them all,
while contracting out to the private sector previously inalienable
public-sector activities such as prison administration, tax collection and
just about everything else that moves. Formerly sacrosanct vested interests
 -the police, prison officers, the united corps of teachers - are being
challenged with the intent of facing them down.
Against all that the convening of a few meetings of businessmen and women in
the office of Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, is a
mere public relations exercise. Interventionism is only real when it is
accompanied by a cheque. Mr Heseltine has no account on which to draw. In
short, Mr Major is not halting the Thatcher juggernaut. He is holding onto
it for dear life, coat-tails flying as it gathers speed.
Much of the force comes from the Treasury. The prime minister's single most
defining characteristic is that he is a Treasury apparatchik. Last year's
public spending plans were completed at a time when the administration was
deeply demoralised. There was no political capital to spend on deep cuts.
This year the attempt is being made once more, with the long-term spending
review. Easier said than done. As the mild-mannered secretary for social
security, Mr Peter Lilley, demonstrated on BBC Breakfast with Frost on
Sunday, his gargantuan social budget is extremely hard to trim. Mr Lilley,
like Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is proudly of
the Tory right. The pair of them will either find ways of squeezing the
welfare state, or it will be Thatcher's heirs, not Mr Major, who failed.

FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Relational contracts are a matter of culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL HARTLEY-BREWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a consultant on negotiation to several banks and corporations, I
agree with the thrust of Professor John Kay's article on 'relational
contracts' ('The unwritten code of lasting business', March 29). Two points
require comment.
Firstly, Prof Kay says that 'UK banks were ready to discard such
(relational) contracts with their customers . . . in the pursuit of a more
commercial, performance-oriented transactional style of business'. The banks
were not the only parties pushing in the transactional direction. Many
companies, particularly the larger ones, have been out bargain-hunting for
financial services, playing the banks off against each other and using their
buying-power to get the best deals.
It is not difficult to characterise this as cut-throat short-termism, but
there is surely merit in questioning what may have become over-easy
relationships.
Secondly, Prof Kay rightly points out that, while relational contracts can
yield competitive advantage, 'each party is exposed to the risk of
opportunistic behaviour by the other'. There is an implication that the risk
is equal on both sides; but in many cases the relationship is far from
equal. Big firms are buying from minnows, who live in constant fear that the
big fish will turn out to be sharks.
Part of the problem here is the frequent mismatch between company policies
and behaviour on the ground. The official corporate philosophy may be to
establish mutually beneficial, long-term 'win-win' relationships with
suppliers. But individual buyers frequently regard this as so much flannel.
This is hardly surprising when buyers are judged by the level of discount
they achieve or by margin improvement. Nor should the big fish be surprised
if the small fry seem sceptical about their real intentions.
The moral is that big companies need to work harder at achieving consistency
in the messages they send within their organisations. Prof Kay is certainly
right in pointing to the cultural aspects of relational contracting. I
imagine he would agree that it is a matter of corporate, as well as
national, culture.

FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: India will stick to environmental and relief
standards for dam without World Bank loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K V RAJAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The report from your correspondent in New Delhi ('India to drop World
Bank dam loans', March 30) gives a distorted picture about the government of
India's decision not to seek further financial support from the World Bank
for the Narmada project.
There has been no reluctance by the government of India or the state
governments concerned to meet benchmarks regarding environment and relief,
and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) standards. Henceforth, too, with the implementation
of the project through our own resources, we propose to fully adhere to the
prescribed environmental and R&amp;R standards.
Because of preoccupations of some of the states, arising out of certain
developments between December 1992 and now, which are well known to
everyone, progress in meeting a few benchmarks has been somewhat slower than
planned; but they are in the process of being met.
The government of India is determined to complete the project as it is of
vital significance for the development of several million people in the
states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. When completed, the
project will provide perennial irrigation to nearly 2m hectares, generate
1450MW of power and provide drinking water in a chronically drought-prone
area.

FT  06 APR 93 / Letter: Fixed exchange rates must also be adjustable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Laurens van den Muyzenberg (Letters, March 30) did well to remind
the sceptics among us that 'almost nothing will do more to facilitate trade
than fixed exchange rates'. After all, no sensible person (foreign exchange
dealers excepted) can want floating rates for their own sake.
If fixed exchange rates are, however, best because of the stability and
discipline they help to provide, they must also be adjustable if need be, as
the ERM rules (and those of the Bretton Woods system earlier) lay down. Who
doubts that Black Wednesday's trauma could have been avoided by a general
ERM realignment in good time?
Of course, given the same quality of economic management (and particularly
the same commitment to price stability and hence sustainable, non-cyclical
growth) everywhere, the results with fixed but adjustable exchange rates and
those with floating ones would be the same. The question is, which system
would best promote such convergence?

FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Yankees on the fringe - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's fringe theatre has gone very American. After David Mamet's early
play Squirrels at the King's Head, a new company, Small Talk Theatre, is
reviving another Mamet, Sexual Perversity in Chicago at the Etcetera in
Camden Town. Meanwhile, the Gate in Notting Hill has come up with a
relatively unknown playwright in Wendy MacLeod, whose The House of Yes has
the disadvantage of harking back yet again to the day that President John F
Kennedy died, but adds a macabre Jacobean touch of incest.
All three productions are superbly done. What they also have in common is
short, terse dialogue and rapidly changing scenes. Possibly the influence -
the desire to play it fast - comes from Hollywood. Some of the Mamet scenes
last less than a minute. In The House of Yes one key scene is acted several
times over, though each time with a twist.
None of the plays is quite up to Arthur Miller's The Last Yankee, still
playing at the Young Vic, but there is a vitality in the writing and staging
of all them that the indigenous theatre has temporarily lost. The small
platform is the right place for them, but it the same kind of taut dialogue
that makes City of Angels such a good musical. Americans are still talking
to each other on stage.

FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Avant-garde hero worship - A celebratory exhibition of
Marcel Duchamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS FULL study of the life and works of Marcel Duchamp continues the series
of important and enlightening exhibitions that has been occupying Fiat's
Palazzo Grassi, on the Grand Canal at Venice, since 1986, taking modern, old
master and broader cultural subjects turn and turn about. But if the
usefulness - indeed the importance - of this exercise is beyond doubt, it
may be so after rather a different fashion to the one intended by the
organisers.
It cannot be said too often that serious critical study may be justified
quite as much by a sceptical as by a celebratory approach to its subject.
Yet with the fine and plastic arts, most especially with modernism and the
contemporary avant garde, the approach is invariably one of insistent
justificatory celebration.
Marcel Duchamp, one of the great guru figures of 20th century art, was born
in 1887 and died in 1968. By the 1960s, by then long isolated from the
immediate engagement with Cubism, Futurism and Dada that had once given his
work at least a context and contemporaneity of sorts, he had become a
singular hero to the post-war generation of the avant garde. Since then,
through his ideas and practical example, he has exerted a greater influence
on the currency of modernism than any other artist.
To say, with Pontus Hulten and Jacques Caumont, respectively director and
curator of the exhibition, that 'There are no works of art today which are
not related, in one way or another, with the ideas developed by Duchamp', is
patent nonsense.
What is true is that the enthusiasms of the international curatorial
establishment of modernism, and the orthodoxies of the avant garde these 30
years past, owe everything to him. And, in England, art education itself was
remodelled in the mid-1960s on half-baked Duchampian ideas, with such
forcing-houses as Goldsmith's College refining the product today as never
before. Should they ever think about it, the only thing that would perplex
these latter-day acolytes, guardians of the sacred flame, from the Richards,
Hamilton and Long, to Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, is Duchamp's own
self-denying ordinance: that a single idea should receive but a single
expression.
The art-educational application of Duchamp's ideas is of particular
relevance, for as experimental exercises in perception, analysis and
response, albeit anarchic and ultimately nihilistic, there is something to
be said for much of what he demonstrated, up to a point. With the metres
etalon of 1914, for example, by all means play the little game, once: 'If a
horizontal thread one metre long falls straight from a height of one metre
on to a horizontal plane twisting as it pleases and creates a new image of
the unit of length.' How long is a piece of string? How many ways are there
to break an egg?
In just such a way, what had never been considered before enjoys a momentary
frisson of discovery and at once sinks back into the obvious and the banal.
In just such ways may the youthful sensibility be honed and sensitised.
Would that it had been left at that: but Duchamp preserved his threads as
they fell, froze their profiles in wooden templates, called them '3 standard
stoppages = canned chance', and put the whole lot together in a special box.
He devised colour-wheels and cones, some with texts after the fashion of
prayer-wheels, and as they whizz round, what pretty patterns and rhythms
they make.
Touch up the art-work: make perfunctory etchings after the works of others,
Courbet, Rodin, Ingres, Cranach: put a moustache on the Mona Lisa: keep
copious notes, keep every scrap and jotting and put them in a case that
becomes at once a portable museum: just pick up anything you like and call
it art - oh, what fun, and how easy to do.
The ready-mades are Duchamp's most notorious and most characteristic works,
that combine immediacy, practical opportunism, wit and mischief. A
bottle-rack, a crown of coat-hooks, a urinal, all become sculpture and art
at Duchamp's decree that they are so, and up to a point, why not? To see
things and to know them for what they are is one of the great gifts the
artist offers the layman, and unself-conscious formal qualities and
imaginative possibilities are qualities and possibilities nonetheless.
But into the museum they all go, with the deadening, pseudo-critical
validation of the perpetrator's own ramblings: 'Specifications for
Readymades, by planning for a moment to come . . . to inscribe a readymade.
The readymade can later be looked for (with all kinds of delays). The
important thing then is just this matter of timing, this snapshot effect . .
. a kind of rendezvous. - Naturally inscribe the date, hour, minute on the
readymade, as information . . . '
The early work as so often, gives the game away. For here was the young
Duchamp anxious to follow the example of his elder brothers, Jacques Villon
and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and become an artist. To be an artist is a great
thing, his is a seductive vocation, glamorous and romantic. But painting
itself is very difficult, and so often a matter of the greatest frustration
to the intelligent man who yet cannot make his hand and materials accomplish
what he would wish. Surely there must be an easier way? Aha, perhaps there
is.
The secret is to elevate content, that is to say the animating idea, above
form and technique: and if it should be so elevated, why not detach it
altogether? Duchamp was no painter, and his great if questionable legacy to
the art of our time is that, if you cannot do it, you do not have to do it.
The thought, the concept, is the thing. It is the nicest irony that his very
demonstration of the conceptual principle should render all the conceptual
art that has followed, that we know and love, in the strictest sense,
unnecessary, redundant, otiose.

FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Mireille - a worthy survivor from a Provencal idyll /
Paris Opera
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A cheering, reassuring sight
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
queues stretching across the Place Boieldieu in front of the Opera-Comique
in Paris for a Sunday matinee. The attraction? Not a baroque revival by one
of the authentic-instrument groups approved by the musical 'tout Paris', but
Gounod's Mireille - a survivor from the old popular repertory now gingerly
being taken down from the shelf and found good.
The process is not confined to Paris: this Mireille started in Avignon and
will also be shown in Lausanne, Nantes and Tours. The queuers were rewarded
by an uncommonly enjoyable performance of some ravishing music reflecting
Gounod's sudden, overwhelming love affair with the sights and sounds of
Provence. The first act and much of the second form a perfect pastoral
idyll. The transition from idyll to rural tragedy is not altogether happily
made but there remains plenty to enjoy: nothing turns ponderous, nothing
goes on too long.
Robert Fortune's production, clearly designed with touring in view, in sets
by Dominique Pichou and costumes by Rosalie Varda is traditional, honest,
colourful, suggesting the sun and shadow of Arles and the country round
about with a minimum of detail (the costumes, I fancy, are accurate). The
Provencal songs and dances are presented simply without quaintness or
condescension. Choral and choreographic movement (the latter by Laurent
Noris) are smoothly interwoven. The third act scenes in the Val d'Enfer and
on the banks of the Rhone avoid the wishy-washiness lurking in Gounod's
deliberately subdued treatment of the supernatural. Only the last act lost
its way, with a corner of the Crau desert surely too invitingly sunny to
give Mireille her fatal sunstroke (not even a glimpse of the mirage she
sees) and a final scene in the chapel of the Saintes Maries suddenly
switching style to black drapes and banks of electric candles.
There was a partly double cast. I heard Michele Command as Mireille and Luca
Lombardo as the basket-weaver Vincent, whom she loves in spite of furious
opposition from her father, a rich farmer. The soprano pleaded throat
trouble but showed little sign of it. Both are most likable performers, she
warm, easy, supple, phrasing sensitively, the tenor elegant, ardent and
youthful. Both, the tenor especially, have excellent diction (Michel Carre's
adaptation of Mistral's Provencal epic is no fun to read but it sings well).
Ourrias the drover, who wounds Vincent out of jealousy, was sung with biting
intensity by the Belgian baritone Marcel Vanaud. The character does not
normally stand out so clearly from the other deep voices. The short but
telling role of the kindly witch Taven was taken at this performance by the
veteran Rita Gorr. This rightly popular favourite has plenty of power left:
at moments I thought she might shake the ruins of Arles to their
foundations. The small parts were well cared for, the mysterious ferryman
(Christian Poulizac) making the utmost of his moment of glory. Cyril
Diederich, conducting the Opera-Comique chorus, the Hauts de Seine
children's choir and the Colonne Orchestra, fill the theatre with joyous,
mellow sound. Gounod scores like Schubert, much of whose melodic gift, in
this opera especially, he inherited.
If a new government in France means a shake-up in the operatic world it
would be another opportunity (there have been others but they have slipped
by) to give a more positive role to the Opera-Comique. This famous
institution is under-used. The building - old-fashioned, inconvenient and
ill-equipped - could do with some of the funds shovelled into bigger things
more likely to produce 'gloire'.
From the spectator's point of view, is there a better house for hearing
medium-sized opera? Many years back, Rolf Liebermann, then director of both
the Opera and the smaller house spoke in an interview of the Opera-Comique's
great prestige and illustrious past, stressing that of all lyric theatres in
France it had staged the greatest number of first performances. That past
adds up to a rich repertory much of which may not appeal to social or
cultural snobs, but is an essential part of French musical culture. Seeing
the queues for Mireille, one cannot hardly doubt public support, given a
chance.

There are two good movies tonight, though naturally they clash, so if you
want to catch both you will have to tape one. Witness, (9.30 BBC1) a 1985
thriller, takes an American Amish community as its background; an idea which
might have seemed contrived but works well. Harrison Ford gives probably his
best performance as the detective trying to protect one of the community's
women, and her son who witnesses a murder.
Paris Texas, directed by Wim Wenders is more difficult to describe: it is
about a man who loses himself, metaphorically and literally, and - perhaps -
finds himself again. He also finds his wife, played by Nastassja Kinski (yet
another role which scarcely begins to stretch her) working in a Texas peep
show. Sam Shepard's script writing clearly worked well for Wenders (10.00
C4). Both films are concerned with the difficulty of sustaining
individuality in modern American society.
Howard Jacobson, flavour of the month thanks to 'Roots Schmoots', argues in
Without Walls that Judas Iscariot was misjudged (9.00 C4).

FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Behind the Veil - New York Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
America has yet to fall under the spell of 'The Protecting Veil'. The
recording has only just been released in the US, and Steven Isserlis's
performance at Carnegie Hall last week was the first in New York, coming
nearly four years after the Prom premiere that launched the current British
wave of interest in John Tavener's music. The mood in the hall was
expectant, but also sceptical, which may be why the performance missed
incandescence. However, there could have been other reasons.
For one thing, to hear Tavener abroad, and played by non-British musicians
(the strings of the New England Conservatory Symphony, under Michael Tilson
Thomas, were accompanying Mr Isserlis's long cello song), is to be reminded
how English his music is - how much its wide-spanning harmonies, say, belong
in the tradition of Vaughan Williams, not Copland. The playing was
remarkably assured, but too much fizz and thrust and energy was going into
the music, and the imitation bell sounds, which reappear to celebrate
arrivals at different points in the life of the Mother of God, had an
unwanted bodily enthusiasm to them.
It could also be that the piece simply works better on record. Everything
visual at a concert performance is alien to it: the movements of the soloist
(the unbroken line of cello sound asks to be heard as disembodied, as if the
instrument were uttering by itself - or, better, as if there were no
instrument at all but only the sound), the gestures of the conductor, the
uniform obediences of the orchestra, the tiered audience.
The inevitable noise of public performance, too, is out of place: even
applause seems mistimed, except as an acknowledgement of the heroic feat of
stamina, intensity and musicianship achieved by the soloist. Mr Isserlis in
his recording sets himself a high challenge; here his maintenance of full,
pure tone, up to the highest register and down to the tiniest pianissimo,
was extraordinary. It was showpiece playing from one about to receive the
triennial Piatigorsky Award.
But possibly the not-quite-satisfactory effect of the performance as a whole
was entirely a subjective phenomenon: the result of over-exposure, or of
worrying about what continuing admirers of the work may regard as incidental
details, such as the travelogue picturesqueness of the Levantine microtonal
ululations and wild dances, or the wearying repetitions of the same music to
open each new chapter, or the limited melodic invention. All is well if
nothing happens to make one start asking questions. As soon as one does, the
first has to be that of how to interpret Tavener's simplicity as ascetic and
not merely cosy.

FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Pacific hot potato - Barclays'
challenge to California's unitary tax system has reached the US Supreme
Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running legal battle over California's controversial system for
taxing the operations of foreign companies has finally reached the US
Supreme Court. Some time next month the justices will have to decide whether
to review the nine-year-old case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK, which
alleges that the state's unitary tax system is unconstitutional.
The case is being followed closely by a number of foreign governments and
multinationals with subsidiaries in California, and it could spark the first
confrontation with President Bill Clinton over his pledge to increase the
overall contribution made by foreign companies to the US fiscal pot.
Under California's unitary tax system foreign-owned companies operating in
the state are taxed on the percentage of their worldwide payroll, sales and
property within California, rather than their locally earned income.
Companies are liable to pay tax on this basis even if their California
operations make no profit.
At issue in the Barclays litigation is more than Dollars 500m in taxes plus
interest paid by foreign multinationals into California's coffers up to
1988, when the state relaxed its unitary tax rules to allow companies to opt
out of paying unitary tax in return for paying a fee.
The history of the litigation is complex. In 1984 Barclays Bank, with the
support of other multinational corporations and several foreign governments,
filed a lawsuit alleging the California system was unconstitutional as its
so-called 'worldwide combined reporting' regime interfered with the US
federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy.
After several battles in California's lower courts the case reached the
state's appeals court in December 1990 where the judges ruled in Barclays'
favour. But in May last year the California Supreme Court reversed that
decision. While acknowledging that four US presidents have opposed state
unitary taxes, the California Supreme Court held that Congress, which holds
power over foreign commerce, has not opposed the tax. The law 'does not give
executive (branch) officials carte blanche to declare state tax methods null
when they irritate our trading partners,' Justice Armand Arabian said.
The case has now reached the US Supreme Court along with two others which
have been running in parallel - one involving Alcan Aluminum of Canada and
the other Colgate-Palmolive, the US-based multinational.
In February Barclays filed a petition with the US Supreme Court for
certiorari (to have the California Supreme Court's decision quashed). Alcan
and Colgate are expected to file similar motions shortly.
The California Franchise Tax Board and others interested in filing amicus
briefs, supporting either Barclays or California, have until April 24 to
submit their views to the court before the justices decide on whether to
review the case.
The state's fear is that if it loses either the Barclays or Alcan cases,
domestic multinationals will also demand the withdrawal of the unitary tax
on the basis that they have the right to equal treatment. That could cost
the state as much as Dollars 3.3bn in tax refunds and an estimated Dollars
110m a year in revenue.
The equal treatment argument lies at the heart of the Colgate case. Colgate
is attempting to overturn an earlier US Supreme Court decision on the issue
in which the justices upheld the basic fairness of California's 'worldwide
combined reporting' method of taxing US-based multinationals.
Will the US Supreme Court agree to review the Barclays case? Most US lawyers
believe that the whole issue of the taxation of US subsidiaries of foreign
multinationals has become such a political hot potato since the US
presidential election that the justices would find it hard not to accept the
issue for review.
But the bigger question is whether President Clinton will support the
Californian case as he promised to do during last year's presidential
election campaign. Lawyers acting for California wrote to the new
administration last month reminding the president of his campaign promise
that 'a Clinton administration would be pro-California in this litigation'.
The state tax authorities know that unless the president specifically
instructs the US solicitor general to file an amicus brief in support of the
California case by the April 24 deadline the solicitor general will, as a
matter of course, continue the policy of previous US administrations and
file a brief in support of Barclays.
If the Clinton administration does follow through on the president's
campaign promise, 'it will be yet another indication of changes affecting
foreign investment in the US as a result of the Clinton presidency', says Mr
Charles Engros, a partner of Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith, the US law
firm.
It could also produce the first confrontation between the US and foreign
governments over America's tough new approach to the taxation of foreign
multinationals.
Senior sources in the UK Inland Revenue confirm that the British government
will be filing an amicus brief with the court in favour of Barclays'
position and that Britain's stance will be supported by the EC member states
and other governments around the world, including Canada and Japan.
Previous US administrations have always opposed unitary taxation of
foreign-owned multinationals and have also been firm in their support of
Barclays at each stage of the litigation, according to a Inland Revenue
spokesman.
The UK government has been holding 'high-level' discussions with the US
administration and is confident of its continued support, he said. Earlier
indications of a policy change came 'before President Clinton was aware of
the full international ramifications of the issue and the reasons for
previous US administrations strong support for Barclays'.
One of those ramifications is the possibility of retaliatory action against
US multinationals by foreign governments. The UK took powers in the 1985
Finance Act, now enshrined in section 812 of the Taxes Act, to bar tax
credits to the parent companies of US groups with subsidiaries in the UK.
These powers have never been used. The government has always taken the view
counter-measures are a last resort, the spokesman said. But if the Barclays
case fails there would be considerable parliamentary pressure to invoke the
retaliatory legislation.
Barclays is reluctant to talk about the litigation while the issue is so
'politically sensitive'. However, it admits that if the Supreme Court
refuses to grant certiorari, or reviews the case and upholds California, it
may be the end of the road so far as it is concerned.
The costs of the eight-year legal battle have not been enormous compared
with the Dollars 30m in taxes it hopes to recover if it wins. But the bank
would be reluctant to begin all over again at state level looking for new
grounds on which to challenge the unitary tax.
Other multinationals might be prepared to take up the fight, but some US
lawyers believe that if Barclays loses, it might be the signal for a
political solution to the whole unitary tax problem. 'It is within
Congress's power to pass legislation which may overturn the court's
decision, if they are so inclined,' says Mr Engross.
After more than a decade of wrangling many companies and governments will be
hoping - one way or another - to see the back of the issue in 1993.

LITIGATION between the English firm of solicitors Zaiwalla &amp; Co and the
Indian government over unpaid legal fees is close to settlement after a
two-week hearing in the High Court estimated to have cost some Pounds
400,000. On Friday New Delhi formally abandoned its counterclaim for Dollars
585,000 alleging negligence against Zaiwalla &amp; Co after the judge Mr Justice
Gatehouse said the counterclaim was 'hopeless' and should never have been
brought in the first place. The firm is seeking payment of fees accumulated
over five years for representing the Indian government in London.

FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Appointment to silk cuts no ice with
barristers - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR in England and Wales is calling for radical changes in the way
Queen's Counsel are appointed. An article in the Bar's magazine, Counsel,
says that barristers must be prepared to take a firm stand in court on
behalf of their clients even in the face of judicial disapproval. Yet it is
predominately judges who advise the lord chancellor on appointments to silk.
Some applicants have been refused because of the animosity of a particular
judge, it says.
A similar article entitled A very English form of Corruption by an unnamed
barrister in New Law Journal cites several examples of barristers whose
appointments have been delayed or blocked by a single judge. In one
well-known case a candidate had his appointment blocked by a judge because
he shared the judge's mistress. The Bar calls for the setting up of a panel
of senior members of the practising profession who would advise the prime
minister, not the lord chancellor, on suitable applicants.

FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Court annuls Commission's pulp fines -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has annulled the principal findings of a 1984
European Commission decision to fine 40 US, Canadian and Scandinavian
woodpulp producers and three trade groups up to Ecu500,000 for operating a
price fixing cartel on sales of woodpulp in the EC between 1975 and 1981.
The main evidence relied on by the Commission was parallels between both
'announced' and 'transaction' prices of woodpulp, though there was some
evidence of direct contacts between some producers. US, Canadian and Finnish
producers sought annulment of the decision on the grounds that there had
been no concerted behaviour.
In 1988 the Court appointed experts to report on the Commission's findings
of parallel pricing, and the evidence on which they were based.
Last week the Court annulled the Commission's finding of collusion on
transaction prices on the grounds that it infringed the producers' rights of
defence. The case against the producers on transaction prices had not been
set out sufficiently clearly in the Commission's statement of objections.
In respect of announced prices the court said that a system of quarterly
price announcements to customers did not in itself infringe EC competition
rules. As the Commission had no direct evidence of concerted behaviour it
was necessary to ascertain whether there could be another explanation for
the observed parallels in prices.
The Court-appointed experts reported that the practice of quarterly
announcements reflected purchasers' needs and market conditions. The near
simultaneous price announcements could also be explained by market
information passing speedily via buyers, common agents and a dynamic trade
press.
Finally, the identical prices reflected an oligopolistic market. The
Commission's finding of collusion was therefore not based on 'a firm,
precise and consistent body of evidence', and should be annulled.
A separate finding that US producers colluded on transaction prices in 1975
and 1976 was also annulled. However, the Court upheld findings that Finnish,
Swedish and other European producers had colluded on hardwood pulp prices
between 1973 and 1977.
Fines were annulled or reduced to Ecu20,000 and companies were released from
price undertakings.
Joined Cases 89,104,114,116,117, and 125-129/85: A Ahlstrom OY v Commission,
ECJ 5CH, 31 March 1993.
Plasterboard Decision Upheld
THE Commission's 1989 decision fining British Gypsum for infringements of EC
competition rules has been upheld by the Court of First Instance.
The Commission had fined British Gypsum and its parent, BPB Industries,
Ecu3m and Ecu150,000 respectively for abuse of their dominant position in
the plasterboard market.
The companies asked the court to annul the decision or reduce the fines.
They argued that the Commission had infringed their rights of defence by
failing to disclose all the documents in its possession. They stressed that
they had not been given access to documents supplied to the Commission by
third parties.
The Commission argued that the contested decision was based exclusively on
documents to which the companies had access; in any event, it argued that
the rights of defence in competition matters did not entitle parties to
proceedings to have access to all documents in the Commission's possession.
The Court found there had been no infringement of the companies' rights of
access to the Commission's file. It said the Commission was entitled to
restrict access to third party documents because of their confidential
nature. Such documents should not be revealed to dominant companies which
were capable of retaliatory action against companies which had helped the
Commission in its investigation.
