FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Can house prices get off the floor? -
John Authers asks if the market is set to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
A GHASTLY hush has fallen on the housing market. Investors, homeowners and
potential homebuyers are standing back, waiting to see if house prices can
take off again.
The silence, compared with previous loudly proclaimed false dawns, is
because everything that can be done to stimulate the market has already been
done. If the housing market followed the same economic rules as other
markets, it would already have recovered. But houses have special
characteristics, which fuelled house price inflation at the end of the
1980s, and which might stifle recovery.
Potential first-time buyers have access to historically low interest rates
and house prices which have dropped sharply since the boom of 1988. In the
last two decades, houses have rarely been cheaper in proportion to income.
If they buy a house for between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000, the Budget
has relieved them of the burden of 1 per cent stamp duty.
House prices are sending confusing signals. The Halifax house price index
fell in the first two months of this year, logging an overall annual fall of
7.2 per cent. But the Nationwide index rose 1 per cent in March.
Further possible bad news comes from the Adams Residential Property Index,
which is compiled by James R Adams, a market research consultancy, by
monitoring housing completions made by solicitors. It shows completions at
an all-time low of 59,963 for February. This is usually the worst month of
the year for completions - but last year, the figure was 69,943, and in 1991
it was 83,150. In 1989, it was more than 100,000.
Optimists about the property market can call on figures released by the
Halifax building society, the UK's biggest lender, in evidence. Halifax says
that Halifax Property Services, its estate agency, had its best month for
two years in February, although the sales it made will not be reflected in
completions figures for some months.
Halifax's research of potential first-time buyers found that since July last
year, when base rates were at 10 per cent, 34 per cent more were seriously
considering buying, including 130 per cent more of those currently renting.
Other lenders report a similar experience. Abbey National and Nationwide
have had increased applications, which have yet to convert into sales. If
all these people go through with their purchases, the housing market could
at last have the volume to fuel a recovery in house prices.
Whether they do so will depend on confidence. People need to believe in the
housing market before it can pick up again. John Ginnarlis, of PA Consulting
Group, says there used to be two separate demands for housing: as a
commodity and as an investment. After several years of falling prices,
people only want property as a commodity.
Can the market ever recover, given that confidence has taken such a blow?
Joe Egerton, of Economic and Regulatory Analysts, points to extra structural
difficulties. First is the problem of 'negative equity' - when the value of
your house would not pay the costs of paying off the loan. Once transaction
costs and high mortgage indemnity premiums are taken into account, many
people who could sell their house for more than the outstanding mortgage
have a disincentive against moving.
The bubble of people who bought at a younger age than they would normally
have done deprives the market of its usual quota of first-time buyers. The
people who would normally have fuelled a recovery are instead 'well and
truly locked in,' said Egerton.
A survey by NOP shows that in the six months to September last year,
first-time buyers made up 34 per cent of the new mortgage market. In the
boom-time of 1987, they accounted for 56 per cent of mortgages.
On a practical level, Egerton points out that many of the conversions and
other cheap properties bought to 'get on the housing ladder' in 1988 are now
in poor condition and, therefore, harder to sell. Many of these properties
have moved into a rental 'black market', let at low prices to friends, of
the owners, making reliable statistics of the rental market impossible to
compile.
Egerton says, 'there definitely is a recovery in sales,' but this applies
only to quality properties at reasonable prices. Even this is an improvement
on a year ago. However, Egerton's arguments suggest that a repeat of the
boom of 1988 is impossible - the demand does not exist to sustain it.
James Morrell, economic adviser for Charterhouse, has a more positive view.
He believes that increased volume is important in pushing house prices up.
'There's about a year's time lag between the change in volume of
transactions and a change in house prices,' he says.
On that basis, this could be a good time to buy, as the bottom may have been
reached. The figures for volume look like a trough, and may be followed by
greater activity if the cautious report from lenders are correct. Morrell is
confident: 'People who are planning to go into the market would be a bit
unwise to dither much longer.'
Even so, a small recovery this year would leave prices at the same level
they reached in 1992 - therefore showing a loss, in real terms, once
inflation is taken into account. Housing still does not make sense as
investment alone, and poor quality housing, as many of the buyers of 1988
would agree, should be avoided.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to pay off a home loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW should you repay a mortgage?
The answer pushed by the financial services industry over the last few years
is that you should not repay it directly, but put money towards an
investment as collateral. Over 25 years, you pay just the interest on the
loan and repay the capital only at the end of that time. According to Adams
RPI, 63.1 per cent of mortgages taken out last year were backed by an
endowment, while 33.7 per cent were capital repayment. In 1988, the
imbalance was even greater: 75.9 per cent against 21.3 per cent.
The argument against capital repayment mortgages is that very little of the
capital is repaid in the early years. Given that homeowners move house every
six years on average, they may find that they have made little progress
towards paying off the debt. With an endowment policy or other savings
mechanism, you are always making progress towards that repayment date.
Furthermore, to the extent that mortgage interest relief survives, it is
more tax efficient to pay interest than to repay capital.
However, this argument only makes sense if the savings scheme is maintained
for the full 25 years. Sadly, this seems not to be the case. Most mortgage
endowments are not maintained until maturity, meaning that penal surrender
values are imposed on the borrower.
If you need to reduce payments for any reason, repayment mortgages offer a
simple method - you can just stop repaying capital for a while. With
interest-only mortgages, it should be easy to stop contributing money to the
savings vehicle. But you cannot stop paying premiums into an endowment
without suffering a severe penalty. This inflexibility tips the balance
decisively against endowments - not only are you taking a risk by not paying
off the loan, you are also tying yourself to that course, come what may.
Another option is the personal pension mortgage, where only interest is paid
on the home loan and premiums are paid into a pension plan. The capital is
repaid out of the cash-free sum you are granted on retirement. Personal
pensions are the most tax-efficient investment vehicle for backing a
mortgage, as all contributions are invested gross into an untaxed fund. But
they are also the least flexible - you could find yourself spending most of
your retirement cash on finally completing your house purchase, rather than
investing it to provide greater freedom in retirement.
More flexible collective investment vehicles, such as unit and investment
trusts, allow you to stop payments without penalty. Top-rate taxpayers, in
particular, can buy them very tax-efficiently through Peps (personal equity
plans). But Pep mortgages accounted for only 0.1 per cent of last year's
total.
The safest option is capital repayment, particularly for those buying a home
for life. Those who expect to move frequently and are prepared to take some
care over their investments should get better value from an interest-only
mortgage, linked to a Pep or investment trust savings scheme. As life
assurance can be obtained separately at fairly low cost, there is little to
be said in favour of the endowment mortgage.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Getting into a fix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED rate mortgages have grown in popularity compared with variable rates
over the last few months, writes John Authers.
There is good reason for this. In general, a fixed rate should be preferable
when base rates are set to rise; variable rates give a better chance of
catching a fall.
However, fixed mortgages carry some dangers. First is the arrangement fee -
typically around Pounds 200 - which is often non-refundable. Over a long
period this should still leave you with a saving, but if the mortgage is
only fixed for a year, the benefits may be low.
Then there are package deals. Some lenders have a lower arrangement fee, but
oblige you to buy their own insurance policy. These are almost always at
higher premiums than you could find by shopping around.
You should also beware of strings tied to the repayment mechanism. Some only
offer a fixed rate if you back it with either an endowment or a personal
pension - and neither is generally suitable.
Particularly attractive offers available at present, according to Money
Facts, include 7.95 per cent fixed for five years from Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, which can be taken on an interest-only basis with no extra
insurance; 7.9 per cent fixed until March 31 1998 from Britannia (buildings
and contents insurance is required); and 7.7 per cent from Credit Agricole,
where buildings and contents insurance is required.
Availability of funds poses another argument in favour of fixing. As Weekend
FT readers will know, savings rates from building societies are low at
present, and many savers have withdrawn funds to invest elsewhere. This
makes sense for the saver, but it removes the funds which the building
societies use to back mortgages. This could force mortgage rates up, making
the current fixed rates look better value.

FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: A lingering spectre haunts investors - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q: What is the link between the Bank of England's successful gilt auction
this week and the sudden suspension of shares in Queens Moat Houses, the
hotel chain?
A: The legacy of the ERM. Britain's two-year membership of the system, and
the sky-high interest rates it required until last autumn, hang over the
financial markets still. The effects will continue to shape events for some
time to come.
Take Queens Moat. A week ago, the company was in what seemed like routine
talks with its bankers to renew its borrowing facilities. Apparently, it was
doing nothing to dispel the view that profits for the year to mid-January
would be around the Pounds 80m predicted by analysts.
On Wednesday, Queens Moat announced that its shares were suspended, at its
own request, that a Pounds 7m dividend payment was being postponed, and that
it was seeking clarification of its financial position. By Friday, with
bankers baffled about what was going on, it was unclear whether there would
be any profits at all for 1992.
There are any number of theories about what went wrong at Queens Moat. One
factor, however, is the company's debt burden, not far off Pounds 1bn - a
lot of money for a company with revenues of only Pounds 543m in 1991. There
were significant off-balance sheet borrowings too, as well as a Pounds 207m
slug of convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares, which future
accounting standards are likely to classify as non-equity, worsening gearing
further. In short, Queens Moat had borrowed up to its eyebrows.
The debt was incurred to expand in the late 1990s. Much of that borrowing
was in D-Marks: the bulk of the group's expansion, in the years when
sterling was shadowing the German currency or linked to it through the ERM,
was on the Continent.
When Britain was at the trough of its recession - partly because of ERM
membership - Germany was still booming. Because it was benefiting from
strong business in Germany, Queens Moat's highest share price, 119p, came
relatively late: at the end of 1989, six months after Forte's.
Interest rates continued to rise thereafter; and though, from the autumn of
1992 onwards, UK rates started to fall sharply, German rates stayed
relatively high. What is more, to anyone paying D-Mark interest rates from a
sterling base, debt service costs were painfully increased by the
devaluation of the last quarter of the year. The company has been paying the
delayed price of the bargain-basement interest rates enjoyed during the
years of sterling's artificial strength.
The stock market had recognised the company's problems: in mid-1992, the
shares fell heavily, from the 90p range to 27 1/2 p, a fall triggered by the
revelation of a sharp rise in borrowings. Since then they had recovered, as
analysts decided that the company was through the worst. The shares were
once again on many buy-lists. Until Wednesday.
That was also the day on which the markets were basking in the success of
the Bank of England's largest-ever auction of government bonds, a success
that partly stemmed from the elaborate pre-auction game of double-bluff.
For weeks, the UK's domestic investment institutions had been sending
unenthusiastic signals about their appetite for gilts to the Bank of
England. They rammed the point home by reacting coolly to the size of the
auction when it was first announced, pushing long-term interest rates up.
That made the bonds look just that fraction more attractive. So in the
event, investors bid more strongly for them than their earlier comments
might have suggested. Once it was clear that there were more than enough
buyers for the issue, gilts rallied strongly, pushing long-term interest
rates down again, and neatly rewarding the purchasers with an immediate
capital gain. Everybody could feel pleased.
Except, perhaps, anyone who pays taxes and believes the government's
promises of low inflation. The gilts on offer were 20-year government bonds,
paying 8 per cent every year from now until 2013. If inflation is really
going to be in the 1-2 per cent range for the long term, as the government
promises, then those bonds are yielding between 6 per cent and 7 per cent in
real terms. If you believe the government's promises, that is an attractive
rate for a buyer: most textbooks say you should assume no more than a 3-3
1/2 per cent long-term real return on risk-free investments. But it is a
poor bargain for a taxpayer.
That underlying truth is obscured by dealers' enthusiasm for a 'successful'
gilt auction. It is another of the ways in which the after-effects of
Britain's period of ERM membership - high interest rates, ultimate departure
and all - continue to affect the London markets. Long-term interest rates
have still to fall to levels consistent with the government's inflation
promises. Either the government is right, in which case interest rates have
a lot further to fall; or the level of rates is right, in which case
inflation will be more of a problem than the government is prepared to
admit.
Well, that is for the future. For the moment, London's stock market
analysts, though divided on the outlook for interest rates, seem mostly
agreed that the recession is over but that the current level of prices
already reflects this. The market is thus likely to go sideways for a while,
they say - the sort of consensus that tempts fate.
As the first quarter results captured in the chart show, however, even a
sideways-moving market can throw up significant upward or downward moves in
individual stocks. If you had bought Pounds 1,000 worth of Glaxo shares on
January 1, you would have been exactly Pounds 722 worse off at the end of
March than someone who had plunked their Pounds 1,000 into British Steel. At
least that cannot be blamed on the ERM.

FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: How BM dug itself a hole - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering concern, was
basking in its reputation for bucking the trend after reporting record
pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds 519m. This year it is
forecast to lose Pounds 30m and the question is: will it go bust?
Bank debt and finance leases had risen from Pounds 61m to Pounds 105m in the
six months to December 31. Stock finance and other liabilities amounted to
Pounds 41m.
Now, net assets - including an overvalued pension fund surplus - are
draining away to less than Pounds 120m and bank covenants are being
breached. After weeks of talks with its banks, BM still has no standstill
agreement.
The share price, which peaked at 425p in October 1991, fell from 47p last
Friday night to 18p on Thursday, ending at 21p yesterday. Some institutions
have been replaced by smaller speculative investors.
As the struggle for survival goes on, crumbs of comfort are offered by the
rescue plan, which envisages disposals that might raise the best part of
Pounds 40m. Cost cuts, including 1,000 of the 6,900 workforce, are already
in train.
Whether the banks give these measures time to work depends on their view of
what might be raised in a fire sale by receivers. Some reassurance may be
gleaned from the unsecured nature of most of the bank debt; they do not have
a privileged position in the creditors' queue.
It remains unclear what might emerge at the end of the process. Moger
Woolley, the new chairman, has a background in manufacturing, but the
outcome will be as strongly influenced by what can best be sold to reduce
debt.
Those contemplating the odds on survival probably have little time to
reflect on what has gone wrong. But that remains a big question,
particularly in the week that David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting
Standards Board, launched an assault on acquisition accounting.
BM was founded by Roger Shute, whose original enterprise centred on the
import of Hitachi excavators. His persuasive creed was that a company could
buck recessionary trends through hard work and hard selling. 'If you work 16
hours a day, seven days a week, you do better than the slob who works five
hours a day, three days a week,' he said.
Before the acquisition of Blackwood Hodge in autumn 1990, BM was ungeared
and had been frugal in the issue of shares. Earnings per share were always
Shute's god - that was what the City wanted.
Between 1983-84, when it came to the market by reversing into Braham Millar,
and 1989-90, pre-tax profits multiplied from Pounds 560,000 to Pounds 23.1m
and sales reached Pounds 228m.
Since 1989, however, the UK market for construction equipment is estimated
to have shrunk by nearly two thirds, the US by nearly 40 per cent, Australia
by more than half.
Yet BM's profits kept rising - helped by the Blackwood Hodge acquisition.
True, there were trading and tax-related synergies. And the bad news -
reorganisation costs, stock write-offs and pre-acquisition losses - was
shovelled through the balance sheet in the form of a Pounds 35m reduction in
net assets. The provisions set up in the process helped cushion future
profits.
But the strain on the balance sheet began to show. On the last day of
1990-91, a Pounds 9m disposal helped BM reach its gearing target of about 70
per cent. Early last year, the Pounds 60m rights issue (at 330p a share)
accompanying the Thomas Robinson acquisition raised Pounds 20m more than was
needed to relieve Robinson's debt.
By the time ill health forced Shute's resignation in June, the growth in
profits had run out of steam and their divergence from cash flow became all
too apparent.
BM joins a long list of glamour stocks brought low by the longest recession
since the 1930s. It illustrates the adage: 'If it looks too good to be true,
it is too good to be true.'
But if Tweedie has his way, it should be more difficult for the story to be
repeated. The ASB's latest proposals will push post-acquisition
restructuring costs and write-downs through the profit and loss account  -
as already happens with companies sorting out their own problems.

A fixed rate Tessa has been launched by Birmingham Midshires, the 13th
largest building society. The Quantum Fixed Tessa will pay a fixed rate of
7.25 per cent annually throughout its five year term. An extra 2 per cent
bonus based on the balance at the end of the fourth year will be added to
the final amount. However, you need Pounds 8,400 to open the account. Three
thousand pounds is immediately put in the Tessa and the rest remains in a
feeder account, also earning a fixed 7.25 per cent gross. There is a penalty
of five months' loss of interest if the Tessa is closed early.

National &amp; Provincial has launched a credit card with a laser-engraved
photograph and signature. Its 300,000 Visa card customers will be offered
the new card at the end of April in an attempt to counter rising credit card
fraud, which cost the society Pounds 1m last year. The loss for the industry
was Pounds 165m.
By using a laser, the photograph and signature are burnt through the
laminated surface of the card and into its plastic core, making them
difficult to tamper with.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been using photographs on 31,000 high
value cheque guarantee cards as part of a pilot study, says that none had
been fraudulently misused even after reported lost or stolen.

Pharmaceutical stocks, for a long time the glamour boys of the stock market,
have taken a beating in recent months. The plans of President Bill Clinton
and his wife to reform the US healthcare sector started the rot, but the UK
giants have had suffered setbacks of their own. Glaxo saw the departure of
its chief executive; and this week Wellcome shares suffered from a report
questioning the efficacy of its anti-AIDS drug, AZT. These stocks were
trading on such high price-earnings ratios that bad news was bound to have a
disproportionate effect on their prices.

FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: Bank puts a new gloss on gilts - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS HAVE been neglected by the private investor for understandable
reasons. Too often, inflation has destroyed their value; and they are
difficult to comprehend and buy.
It is true there is a cheap service available at the Post Office. But it is
hardly user friendly: you must queue, there are no specialist staff to help
and it is up to you to decide between the Exchequer 12 1/2 pc 1994 and the
Treasury 9 3/4 pc 2002.
So it is good news that the Bank of England has produced a booklet* with the
aim of giving investors basic information about the gilts market. This
desire to educate is not entirely altruistic; the government may have some
Pounds 50bn of gilts to sell this year and private investors are a large
potential market.
The booklet is a useful guide for beginners, although it does not answer
some of the questions that readers often ask the FT, such as how to
calculate the real yield on an index-linked gilt. Nor is the section on the
taxation of accrued interest clear.
It is a complex area. The price of gilts bought between dividend entitlement
dates includes an element to reflect the accrued interest. If you have
holdings of less than Pounds 5,000, you may find yourself paying income tax
on this accrued element, even though you have paid for it out of capital.
Say you pay Pounds 1,025 for stock reflecting accrued interest of Pounds 25
out of a forthcoming dividend of Pounds 50. You will pay income tax on
Pounds 50, not the Pounds 25 you receive.
But there is a more fundamental question, which the guide does not address.
Bond prices have been rising steadily since the start of 1991 - so is the
government encouraging investors to buy gilts at the peak of the market? Don
Smith of Greenwell Montagu does not think so. He believes that long bond
yields, currently around 8.5 per cent, will fall to 7 3/4 per cent. Since
yields and prices have an inverse relationship, that means gilt prices will
rise.
Greenwell Montagu believes that fears of renewed inflation are overdone. It
expects a rate of 3.25 per cent at the year end, which means that gilts are
trading on attractive real yields of more than 5 per cent.
Those who are not as optimistic as Greenwell Montagu about inflation might
prefer index-linked gilts, which merit two pages of their own in the Bank of
England guide. Both income and repayment values increase in line with the
RPI. However, the trading price does not always rise in line with the RPI,
which is what can cause investors so much confusion. Again, this is not made
clear in the guide.
One practical measure announced this week was an increase in the maximum
that can be invested in gilts via the National Savings Stock Register (at
the Post Office) in any one gilt. This has been increased from Pounds 10,000
to Pounds 25,000 per day. In future, all stocks will be available rather
than just a selection (both changes apply from April 7.) Although you may
not get the best price via the NSSR, dealing costs are cheap (Pounds 1 for
the first Pounds 250, then 50p for every further Pounds 125 or part
thereof). Buying Pounds 25,000 of stock would thus cost Pounds 100.
What the guide cannot tell you is which are the best issues to buy. This
depends on your individual circumstances; need for income, tax position and
so on. It may be worthwhile paying extra in commission to get the benefit of
a stockbroker's advice on this. Greenwell Montagu says private investors are
normally keen to buy issues which are trading below par and have shifted
their attention to the longer end of the market.
Investing in Gilts; a guide for the small investor. Available in 1,500 post
offices or from the Bank of England, PO Box 96, Gloucester, GL1 1YB,
freephone 0800-616814.
S G WARBURG'S new quarterly review of income shares adds further fuel to the
debate about this extremely complex sector. Referring to the so-called
'ordinary income shares' (those with a repayment value which is not set, but
is dependent on the growth of the trust's assets), Warburg says 'at current
levels, the sector is cheap, assuming 5 per cent growth rates in capital and
dividends.'
The shares which Warburg recommends as a result of its analysis are: Fleming
International High; Gartmore American; M&amp;G Income Geared Units; Rights &amp;
Issues Capital: Drayton Blue Chip: Kleinwort High: and River &amp; Mercantile
Extra. These offer gross redemption yields of between 14 and 20 per cent, if
one assumes the trusts' assets and income grow at 5 per cent per annum until
maturity.
However, this does not mean the share prices will grow substantially.
Because of the high dividend income, these shares stand above their
repayment values were the trusts to be wound up today.
Warburg points out that, in some cases, 5 per cent growth in assets will be
needed for investors to get their capital back at redemption. Accordingly,
the return on these trusts is largely in the form of income, which may have
disadvantageous tax consequences for higher rate payers.
This is a sector of the market which should be limited to the very assiduous
amateur investor, and only then with expert advice. The rest would be safer
with the likes of Foreign &amp; Colonial.

FT  03 APR 93 / Markets: Dow sent reeling by a storm in a teacup - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<TEXT>
NEW YORKERS love bad weather. It gives them an opportunity to kick and
scream, gripe and grumble, and all without apportioning blame to anyone in
particular, or without having to accept any responsibility for the mess it
creates.
Wall Street economists also love bad weather, because it provides them with
a fall-back position when faced with a set of statistics that defy easy
explanation.
Take yesterday's employment report for March, for example. When it was
released at 8.30am, the headline number came as a big surprise. Wall Street
had forecast a rise in March non-farm payrolls of between 75,000 and
100,000. In the event, non-farm payrolls fell 22,000 last month.
The bad news provoked an immediate rally in bond prices, as fixed-income
investors interpreted the decline in payrolls as evidence that the economic
engine, so strong in late 1992, was beginning to splutter.
Yet the bond rally lasted no more than a few minutes. Within half an hour of
the employment report's release, bond prices had dropped back into negative
territory, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond decisively
back up through 7 per cent for the first time since mid-February.
As soon as the jobs data was released, economists had to come up with an
explanation as to why the figures did not fit the trend pattern - after all,
payrolls jumped 113,000 in January and soared 365,000 in February.
The answer was bad weather. The sharp turnaround in March payrolls was due,
said economists at the Labor department and on Wall Street, to the fact that
the survey upon which the figures were based (in the survey the government
asks businesses what has happened to their payrolls, and how many hours
their employees have worked, etc, during the month) was taken in the second
week of March, at the time when the 'Storm of the Century' was laying waste
to the entire Eastern seaboard of the US.
Consequently, the severe winter weather temporarily depressed demand for
jobs in crucial industries such as construction (where payrolls tumbled
59,000 in the month), and had a big impact on other figures. The number of
hours worked that week, for example, showed a marked decline in the
manufacturing and retail sectors.
If the effect of the weather was removed from the numbers, the head of the
Bureau of Labour Statistics in Washington DC said, the March data revealed
that the labour market had 'held steady' last month.
Even so, this is hardly a ringing endorsement of the recuperative powers of
the US economy and its effect on the working population. Remember, gross
domestic product grew at the healthy annualised rate of 4.8 per cent in the
final quarter last year, and although it is unlikely to match that for the
first quarter of 1993, the economy is still growing at a respectable pace
when measured against previous post-recessionary periods. The fact that the
labour market has not responded more vigorously to the improvements in
economic conditions continues to worry stock market investors.
This helps explain why share prices fell almost 40 points yesterday morning.
The bad weather story that so impressed bond investors had much less of an
impact on their counterparts in the equity markets, who looked at the jobs
numbers and did not like what they saw - winter storm or no winter storm.
Yet the employment report was not the only action in town this week. After
four extremely quiet trading days in terms of corporate and economic news,
the food and tobacco group Philip Morris stunned Wall Street by announcing
that it expected operating earnings from its key domestic tobacco businesses
to fall by as much as 40 per cent this year.
In an attempt to halt the decline in its share of the domestic market,
Philip Morris also said it would cut prices on its popular Marlboro brand of
cigarettes, a move that represented a dramatic reversal of the company's
pricing strategy.
The news left tobacco stocks, and the market, reeling. Philip Morris shares
plunged more than 20 per cent to just over Dollars 50.
Yet there may be an explanation for Philip Morris's problems. Again, it was
probably the bad weather. Stringent anti-smoking laws in many US cities mean
working smokers have to indulge their habits outdoors, on the street in
front of their offices.
But this winter's severe weather must have forced many of those smokers to
stay indoors, hitting cigarette sales in the process. Simple, really.

FT  03 APR 93 / The Long View: While bankers sleep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANKERS have withdrawn defensively into their parlours, but the sins
they committed as they naively explored the red light districts of late
1980s finance are still troubling them.
This week a string of leading banks faced losing half the Pounds 1bn or more
they advanced in 1989 to support Isosceles, an unquoted supermarket buyout
vehicle which owns the Gateway chain. It was notable for importing concepts
of financial engineering such as mezzanine debt and 'stub' equity (which
even at the time some people unkindly pointed out was an anagram of 'bust').
Now the stores group cannot possibly pay the interest on its mountain of
debt and a financial restructuring is under way. More trouble looms at
Queens Moat Houses, another Pounds 1bn-plus borrower, which asked for a
share price suspension on Wednesday 'pending clarification of the company's
financial position'.
While the banks struggle, and their most troublesome clients are still on
life support, the UK corporate sector as a whole is nevertheless getting its
financial affairs back into passably decent shape. In 1989 and 1990 the
industrial and commercial company sector was running alarming financial
deficits of around Pounds 20bn a year, but that was cut to Pounds 10bn by
1992 and there should be a surplus in the current year, the first since
1987.
The balance sheet of the corporate sector is looking somewhat better
structured, too. At the peak in the late 1980s companies were borrowing more
than Pounds 30bn a year from banks, but in 1991 and 1992 there were actually
small net repayments. Rights issues are already flowing, and confirmation of
economic recovery will bring out many more; in addition, there could be an
active market for new company flotations this year. Elsewhere, big companies
are heavy issuers of Eurosterling bonds. Such capital market refinancing is
good for the corporate sector, but it leaves the banks with a quality
problem: the good loans are being repaid but the bad ones stay on the books.
Five years ago banks dominated the financial markets, and prices of the
kinds of assets they liked to finance rocketed. This applied especially to
property, including hotels, as well as to fringe assets such as Van Goghs.
The banks rarely intruded into the stock market except to finance the
activities of takeover kings in buying companies from investors, which often
happened at up to twice the normal market price. The displaced investors, if
they were wise, put their money on deposit at high interest rates, and
waited.
Now the banks are out of the game and the securities markets are back in
control. Markets in shares, which offer the prospect of rising incomes,
especially attractive to investors such as pension funds, are very high.
Because of the shift in power, takeovers are almost dead: British companies
spent Pounds 1.6bn on the securities of other companies in 1992 compared
with Pounds 18bn in 1989. UK real estate remains stuck in the doldrums as
institutional investors ignore the bogus asset values generated some years
ago by bank finance and look at rental income which is no longer rising but
is flat at best and may fall at the ends of the leases. In the past four
years UK share prices have climbed by 30 per cent, but office property
values, according to Hillier Parker, have fallen by about 35 per cent.
Arguably the opposite kind of value distortion is now present, because
investors - intoxicated by a bull market - are too optimistic about the
extent to which dividends may grow.
There is now a cyclical opportunity for the stock market to extend its reach
down into the smaller company sector. Already the shares of small
capitalisation listed companies have been outperforming. The FT-SE SmallCap
Index is up 14 per cent so far in 1993 while the Footsie index of the 100
leaders has stagnated. So the beleaguered Stock Exchange could have been
over-hasty in threatening last month to shut down its Unlisted Securities
Market, a decision which anyway it appears to have deferred.
While the banks lick their wounds and busy themselves plugging the holes in
their balance sheet ratios there is inevitably concern that shortage of
finance for small and medium-sized companies might threaten the pace of
Britain's economic recovery. In fact this does not seem likely to be a
problem across the middle of the market where there is a variety of sources
of capital led by institutions such as 3i. According to 3i its dividend
income from this sector is still rising, which does not suggest any great
general distress. Meanwhile there is plenty of activity in restructuring
balance sheets, though little sign of demand for capital to finance
expansion of capacity.
But life is much tougher at the very small end, where hundreds of thousands
of 1980s Thatcherite entrepreneurs set themselves up in business with equity
released from overmortgaged homes and floating rate loans from clearing
banks, which jacked up the interest rate from 10 to 18 per cent by 1989.
This is the main source of the frightening statistics of business collapses.
Yet although many sole traders are still going bankrupt the number of
failures of limited companies is starting to tail off.
The combination of wild fluctuations in economic conditions together with
dependence upon floating rate finance is lethal. Somehow an institutional
framework for channelling fixed rate and equity finance to the smallest
businesses needs to be developed, but nobody can see how to make a profit
out of it. It was a vacuum that the clearing banks tried to fill in a way
that they now regret. Losing money did not even make them popular.
But it is astonishing how cycles swing and fortunes fluctuate. Perhaps those
shrewd investors should be reading the commercial estate agents' brochures,
although it is surely too soon to be considering a dabble in flower
paintings by one-eared Dutch painters.

FT  03 APR 93 / The thin blue line that divides Cambodia's killers: Nicholas
Woodsworth sees how the United Nations - and the Royal Navy - are trying to
keep the warring factions under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an old floating cinema, made of wood and perched on a raft of
bamboo trunks, that sits anchored at the slow-swirling mouth of the Tonle
Sap lake in central Cambodia. Potted palms remain at either side of the
landing bay where film-goers used to tie up.
But the seats have been removed and the projectionist has found work
elsewhere: the place is under new management. On top of the cinema's tin
roof, now gleaming white, the letters 'UN' have been painted in figures 6ft
high.
If you stand on the old cinema's roof terrace, where a blue United Nations'
flag flies beside a Union Jack, you might think terra firma had never
existed. Now a military observer's naval patrol base, the floating building
sits lost on a wide flood plain where there is little distinction between
water and land.
This is a world of backed-up lake and flooded forest, swampy islands,
mirror-smooth creeks, and narrow channels of brown water that lose
themselves in endless braids and kinks. It is low and green and an easy
place in which to get lost. All life - plant, animal and human - has become
amphibious.
Just a stone's throw from the UN post, across a little inlet, begins the
settlement of Chhnok Tru. A village of 5,000 people, it has the sort of
amenities many back-country Cambodian towns lack: houses and hairdressers,
hardware and vegetable markets, medical stores, motor repair shops, eating
houses, temples, and bars.
In spite of its size, Chhnok Tru is not marked on any maps. It cannot be,
for the simple reason that it never stays put in any one place. Its houses
are as mobile as the boats that cruise its main thoroughfares. An entire
palm-thatched fishing community floating on bamboo, its location changes
according to the season and the rise and fall of the monsoon-fed lake.
Chhnok Tru is unusual for another reason. Half its population is ethnic
Vietnamese. Some of these immigrants arrived after Vietnam invaded Cambodia
in 1979, toppled its brutal Khmer Rouge revolutionary government, and
installed a regime controlled by Hanoi. Others, seeking jobs, living space
and economic opportunity they cannot find in over-crowded Vietnam, have
arrived only recently. Today all ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia are special
targets for Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have made their repatriation one of
the pre-conditions to participation in UN-sponsored initiatives for peace
and democratic elections.
In March, in the bloodiest massacre since the UN began peace-keeping
operations here, 38 ethnic Vietnamese were gunned down by the Khmer Rouge in
Phum Chong Keas, another floating village on the Tonle Sap 75 kms from
Chhnok Tru.
What are UN peacekeepers up against in Cambodia? Seen from the capital,
Phnom Penh, UN operations here are a confused tangle of accusations and
counter-accusations. All too often, critics say, bureaucratic unwieldiness,
a lack of long-term perspective and the demands of political compromise have
sapped the UN's will to enforce a difficult mandate. I went to Chhnok Tru to
see what it was like, not for the administrator in his office but for the
peacekeeper on the ground - or, rather, the water. Seen from a boat deck on
the Tonle Sap, Cambodia's problems take on a different dimension.
BRITAIN'S Royal Navy has employed a bizarre fleet of water craft over the 12
months it has taken part in UN peace-keeping exercises in Cambodia. In this
sector of its operations, it has collected an old Vietnamese military
landing craft that looks like a steel shoe-box; two Russian 'Kanos' - cabin
cruiser-size, water-impelled jet boats that roar along in a stink of diesel;
and a nippy new runabout that slaps across the water with a 70 horse-power
engine at its stern. But most of the work of the Royal Navy military
observers here is done in little 10ft Zodiac inflatable dinghies. They are
not quite as toy-like as they seem; flat-bottomed and fast, they can
negotiate the shallow channels, strong currents and the thousand
surface-suspended fishing nets that make boating here such a tricky
business.
It was into one of these craft that I piled with several British sailors one
evening after I had arrived at 'Tango Hotel,' the call-sign of the floating
UN post. Our destination, 'Whisky Hotel,' lay not far away among the boats
of Chhnok Tru.
Whisky Hotel is pretty much what it says it is: a bar. The beer is cold, the
lighting dim, the music acceptable and the service comes with a smile. If
you smile back, the Vietnamese women who run it will spend entire evenings
shelling for you the dishes of dried watermelon seeds that come with the
drinks.
I was more or less prepared for the slight bobbing motion of the floating
bar. I was not unnerved by the sudden list it took when we seated ourselves
to one side of the room. Nor was I fazed by the water that began lapping at
our feet under our table. But I was not prepared for the company that, soon
after, sat down at a table opposite us.
CHHNOK TRU sits just below the bottom end of a large salient of Khmer
Rouge-controlled territory that tapers down from the borders of northern
Cambodia. This is an uneasy area of banditry, intimidation, extortion of the
weak, and a continuing low-level war between two of Cambodia's four warring
factions: CPAF, the ragged army of the Phnom Penh government, and the NADK,
the forces of the Khmer Rouge. Here, just about everyone - uniformed
soldiers, village militiamen, provincial government officials, Cambodian
fishermen, Vietnamese immigrants - goes about their business armed.
The CPAF soldiers who boarded the bar seemed as threatening as the boat in
which they arrived. It was narrow, low-slung and fast. Long pipes and intake
valves protruded from an uncovered engine that might have been winched out
of a '56 Chevy. It looked like something dreamed up by an American teenage
garage mechanic with a weekend sideline in hot rods. Only the tripod-mounted
light machine-gun at the bow hinted at more serious intent.
The soldiers swaggered in, dropped two AK-47 Kalashnikovs on the table and
started serious work on a bottle of Mekong whiskey. I felt less than
comfortable, but I had not reckoned with the professional skills of
28-year-old Royal Marine leading hand David Leng. A handshake, a few words
of kitchen Cambodian and soon he was spinning the chambers of .38
German-made revolver the smiling CPAF men brought out for him to admire.
Leng and the other men at Tango Hotel have an easy-going nonchalance that
veils a good amount of self-discipline and level-headedness. Both qualities
are much needed around Chhnok Tru. A large part of the UN military
observer's exercise here is two-way diplomacy: getting to know and inspire
confidence in two sides without appearing to favour either one. It is the
only way unarmed observers can hope to stand between adversaries and try to
create an atmosphere of reconciliation without getting shot at.
In reality, it is rarely that simple. The week before I arrived, Lt Cmdr
Alex Manning, senior officer at Tango Hotel, cruised northward up the Stoeng
Sen river from Chhnok Tru. He was attempting to deliver a letter inviting
the local Khmer Rouge commander to friendly discussions with the UN. The
Khmer Rouge not only took the letter, but him as well. Release came only
after three long and uncertain days.
The 10 UN observers at Chhnok Tru - seven Britons of the navy and marines,
two Filipinos and a Chilean - get on with a job as best they can. Over the
next few days, I accompanied them on the missions that make up a steady
routine of difficult and sometimes risky work.
Using the Kanos, we travelled to an isolated village 30 miles up the vast
Tonle Sap lake to assist in voter registration, a preliminary to
UN-supervised elections planned for May. In the Zodiacs, we patrolled
backwaters and narrow channels, visited local militias, dropped in on
government posts, talked to fishermen, inspected cargoes, and trailed along
behind river-boats where plump, Buddha-like captains sat smiling behind
their machine-guns.
THE MEN OF the Royal Navy are thorough professionals. They complain neither
about difficult local conditions nor the political decisions made by the UN
leadership in Phnom Penh and New York. But no one can avoid seeing that, by
the nature of the mandate handed to them, many of the 20,000 UN personnel in
Cambodia find their work frustrating and ineffective.
There is a strong sense on the ground that the leadership of Untac - the
United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia - has taken too
conciliatory a stance, not just with the Khmer Rouge but with all violators
of the Cambodian cease-fire and peace accords signed in 1991.
One soldier I met at a UN post south of Chhnok Tru put it bluntly: 'The UN
is doing a crap job. What we should be doing is taking guns away from the
nobbers who are shooting people. But all we are allowed to do is request
them to voluntarily surrender their arms. It is like going up to a bear and
politely asking him for his honey.'
The failure of the arms containment plan agreed on by Cambodia's factions is
just one of the frustrations. Cruise up any waterway around Chhnok Tru and
you will find some of the other problems faced every day by ordinary
Cambodians.
At riverside military check-points, CPAF soldiers demand money from
travellers. In the maze of fishing nets out on the lake, corrupt government
administrators extort both catches and money from fishermen. Phnom Penh
officials arrive every four or five days to relieve residents of floating
villages of much of their earnings. In some areas, villagers have to pay off
not only CPAF but the Khmer Rouge as well. The levels of extortion are so
high that many Cambodians seem not to care about which political group
controls them - only about how much they have to be paid.
IN SPITE of the fact that such armed intimidation falls under a UN mandate
for the enforcement of human rights, there is often little military
observers can do. The Khmer Rouge refuses the UN access to its areas.
Elsewhere, incidents can be noted, names taken, serial numbers of arms
recorded. But in a situation of growing unrest and factional violence,
effective civilian government has been all but obliterated. No doubt
UN-supervised elections will take place at some future date. But none of
this bodes well for their free-ness or fairness, nor for political stability
in their aftermath.
But the Royal Navy at Chhnok Tru never says die. On the last day of my stay,
a week after he had been detained on the Stoeng Sen, Alex Manning took David
Leng and me up the river again to investigate Khmer Rouge advances on
CPAF-held territory. We arrived minutes after Khmer Rouge soldiers had
rocketed a CPAF front-line post.
While a CPAF river patrol boat moved up its own Russian B-10 rocket
launcher, soldiers in ragged shirts and flip-flops huddled on the riverbank
cradling grenade launchers. But we saw no fighting; the Khmer Rouge had
melted back into the bush.
What can be done to stop sporadic guerrilla attacks in south-east Asia (or,
indeed, full-scale battles in south-east Europe)? Regardless of their best
intentions, UN forces in Cambodia can be only as effective as their own
leadership and the adversaries involved will allow them to be. We asked
questions, took notes, and listened to protests that it was the other side
that had started it first. Then we headed back down the winding, green river
to Chhnok Tru.

FT  03 APR 93 / West to reschedule Dollars 15bn of Russian debt: Eve of
summit deal offers boost for Yeltsin reforms

<TEXT>
WESTERN CREDITOR nations yesterday moved to bolster the position of Mr Boris
Yeltsin and Moscow's beleaguered reformers by agreeing to reschedule the
bulk of Russia's estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) debt service
obligations due this year.
The agreement comes on the eve of this weekend's US-Russian summit between
Mr Yeltsin and US president Bill Clinton in Vancouver. The summit will
focus, for the first time in the history of great power summitry, on
economic and financial rather than military and security issues.
Yesterday's agreement was signed in Paris by a Russian delegation led by Mr
Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, and the so-called Paris Club
of official creditors. It effectively reschedules over 10 years more than
Dollars 15bn of the total Dollars 20bn in capital and interest due this year
on Russia's foreign debt.
In Washington, the International Monetary fund said it was working on a new
temporary financing facility to help Russia and other former Soviet
republics 'facing particularly disruptive systemic shocks' in their
transition to market economies.
This is the IMF's contribution to the debate on how to get money to Russia
with less stringent conditions than usual for an IMF standby agreement. The
finance would be part of an international aid package which the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations is working on.
But officials said the facility - which might provide more than Dollars 2bn
to Russia - was only one of several options being considered by the G7. The
way is also now clear for commercial banks, grouped in the London Club, to
negotiate a similar rescheduling of private Russian debt servicing
obligations later this year.
Mr Yeltsin will be flanked at today's summit by Mr Shokhin and Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister who is involved in a fierce domestic struggle
for mastery over monetary policy with Mr Viktor Geraschenko, the chairman of
the central bank.
Mr Clinton is expected to mark his first summit by emphasising US desire to
offer practical support but limiting the hard currency on offer to the
Dollars 1bn or so which can be found from the existing US budget.
The US is keen to target Russia's fledgling private sector for special
attention while underlining the US commitment to a broader aid effort from
the G7 countries, including Japan which is hosting this year's G7 summit in
Tokyo this summer.
Japanese diplomats say Tokyo will increase its contribution to a G7 aid
package, despite a continuing dispute with Russia over the future of the
Kurile islands which has limited Japanese involvement to date.
Estimates of Russia's total foreign debt range from Dollars 80bn to Dollars
87bn, of which Dollars 38bn is owed to official creditors and another
Dollars 20bn to commercial banks. The rest mainly comprises unsecured trade
and other credits.

FT  03 APR 93 / Doctors urged to maintain AZT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH AGENCIES worldwide were yesterday advising doctors not to make
immediate changes in the way they prescribe AZT, the leading Aids drug, even
though an international study concluded that it failed to delay the onset of
symptoms in people infected with HIV.
Officials of Wellcome, AZT's manufacturer, talked to financial and medical
institutions, stating alleged shortcomings in the analysis of the trial,
published in The Lancet medical journal. Even so, Wellcome shares closed 51p
down in London at 692p.
Several well-known Aids specialists praised the study, known as Concorde,
which was organised jointly by the UK Medical Research Council and France's
National Aids Research Agency. They believed its conclusion that early AZT
treatment did not produce long-term clinical benefits.
The UK government pledged to maintain Aids research and treatment. Mr Tim
Yeo, junior health minister, said there would be a 'great deal of effort'.
His department is expected to spend Pounds 200m on Aids in the coming year.
In the US, Dr Daniel Hoth, director of the Aids division at the National
Institutes of Health, said NIH officials would meet their British and French
counterparts soon. Until then, NIH will maintain its advice that people with
HIV should begin treatment if their count of CD4 immune cells falls below
500, whether or not they have any symptoms.
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's research director, said further analysis of the
1,749 patient records in the Concorde trial - taking account of the fact
that many had opted to transfer from placebo to AZT - might show more
favourable results.
MRC researchers said: 'The results are certainly not overstated,' said
Professor David Warrell of Oxford University, chairman of the MRC's Aids
trials committee. 'We are confident that the full report will support the
preliminary conclusions.'

FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Brady is striving to clean up Invesco MIM. Yesterday's full-year
figures bear the scars. The cash settlement with Drayton Consolidated, costs
relating to IMRO's compliance investigation and the aborted plan to spin off
the US operations are reminders of a chequered past. The write-off of
development costs relating to Taurus, the Stock Exchange's now defunct
settlement system, adds insult to this list of self-inflicted injuries. A
possible fine by IMRO and the writ from Mirror Group pensioners have still
to be resolved.
In that context, Mr Brady's decision to assume the role of executive
chairman rather than introduce new blood seems strange. True, three new
regional boards each with a chief executive should contribute to a balance
of power. But Invesco must distance itself from the past if it is to stand a
fighting chance of turning the tide in UK fund management. Funds under
management rose slightly in Europe last year, but only after investment
gains. The investment performance may be improving, but institutions are
evidently reluctant to put their faith in the accident-prone group.
With 80 per cent of profits flowing from the US, the attitude of London
matters less than in the past. Invesco MIM's alliance with Peregrine of Hong
Kong adds promise to its prospects in Asia. On that basis, the shares might
look cheap despite the reduced dividend. With a long record of misadventures
to consider, though, the market is right to price in some risk.

FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of MB-Caradon's 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox has ended
one stock market guessing game but started another about what it will do
with the proceeds. MB-Caradon was always the more likely partner to sell out
of the Franco-British packaging group, given its primary interests in
building materials. By contrast, the French partner, CGIP, lives by managing
such investments. It was quite happy to increase its holding by another 7
per cent, giving it 46 per cent of the voting rights and ending lingering
bid speculation surrounding CarnaudMetalbox.
MB-Caradon sold its holding at a 12 per cent discount to its notional market
value. But that is normal for such a big placing. Besides, the price tag of
Pounds 473m would have been beyond the company's wildest dreams two years
ago. There was also the risk that a franc devaluation would have eroded its
worth.
The company seems inclined to sink the cash in the UK building materials
sector. MB-Caradon could easily gear up for a Pounds 1bn acquisition or put
together a string of smaller deals. But given the management's reputation
for caution and fixation with branded products, there is no obvious
candidate in sight. Other European economies are at different stages of the
economic cycle and MB-Caradon may find a suitable target overseas, should
nothing suitable emerge in the UK. It is a nice enough problem to worry
about. MB-Caradon's results on Monday are likely to suggest it has few
others.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in pharmaceuticals has always involved playing roulette with both
industry regulators and the medical community. Yesterday's 7 per cent fall
in Wellcome's share price shows how frayed the market's nerves have become.
The medical study questioning the effectiveness of Wellcome's Retrovir in
slowing the development of Aids could hardly have come at a worse time. Last
week's interim figures pointed to a slowing in Wellcome's rate of growth.
SmithKline Beecham has been trumpeting a possible competitor to Zovirax,
Wellcome's biggest selling drug which has been growing much faster than
Retrovir.
Yet assessing the impact of the latest study is little more than guesswork.
Retrovir's growth prospects turn on convincing HIV patients to take the drug
before the onset of Aids. If the medical evidence dissuades them from doing
so, the 10-15 per cent annual growth expected from Retrovir might crumble.
Since Retrovir accounts for 13 per cent of Wellcome's sales, that would mean
scaling back profits forecasts once again. But that outcome is by no means
certain. It is already clear the future of Aids treatment lies with
combinations of drugs rather than single products.
With the shares down 25 per cent in two weeks - and now 108p below the level
at which Wellcome Trust sold last summer - Wellcome's premium to the sector
has been erased. Having been burned by the experience, the market is clearly
inclined to mark down first and ask questions later.

FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Marlboro's smoke alarm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the US cigarette market launched by Philip Morris yesterday
promises to leave all contenders gasping. Since the US company is prepared
to sacrifice 40 per cent of its operating profit from US tobacco, there is
little doubt that it means business. It will have few resources left for
large acquisitions in the European food industry. But Cadbury Schweppes'
relief is BAT Industries' distress. Unlike Rothmans, the other tobacco
company in the FT-SE, BAT has a large US cigarette business.
BAT generated some Pounds 360m in operating profit from the domestic US
tobacco market last year. A drop in the same proportion as that anticipated
by Philip Morris would knock Pounds 145m or 8 per cent off group operating
income. The shock is unlikely to be as bad as that. By cutting the price of
Marlboro, Philip Morris is sacrificing a high margin brand. BAT's premium
brands like Kool, which account for about 40 per cent of its sales but a
considerably higher proportion of its profits, should escape relatively
lightly.
Still, the heat will burn a significant hole in BAT's earnings: enough to
change the arithmetic on its enhanced scrip dividend even if there is no
short-term threat to dividend growth. After yesterday's 7 per cent fall in
its price, BAT will have to issue more shares - on which it will be making a
smaller return - to cover the scrip payment. Happily, BAT only needs a 9.5
per cent return to prevent the exercise being dilutive over the medium term,
and it has been making over 20 per cent recently. The exercise still offers
value which marginal cases such as Ladbroke cannot hope to match.

FT  03 APR 93 / US jobs figures catch markets off guard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MARKETS were caught off guard yesterday as payroll employment fell by
22,000 last month, against forecasts of an increase of 100,000-150,000.
But encouraging figures for the first quarter as a whole indicated that the
economy was continuing to grow steadily.
The fall in non-farm employment sent financial markets into a tailspin. Bond
prices fell sharply as dealers ignored the unexpected fall in March
payrolls, and focused on the big gains in January and February payrolls,
which they feared could lead to higher inflation. By late last night the
benchmark 30-year long-bond had fallen more than a point, pushing the yield
above 7 per cent.
The jump in bond yields unnerved stock markets already weakened by bad
corporate news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 68.63 down at
3,370.81, having swung wildly in early trading.
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said the figures underscored the urgency
of passing President Bill Clinton's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) stimulus
package.
Interpretation of the data was complicated by a sharp upward revision for
January, showing a rise in employment of 113,000 rather than the 44,000
initially reported. Figures for February were revised slightly to show an
abnormally large gain of 367,000.
In the first quarter the monthly rise in employment averaged 125,000 against
85,000 in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 38,000 in the three preceding
quarters.
The jobless rate last month was unchanged at 7 per cent, sharply lower than
the 7.7 per cent peak reached last summer. The only substantial rise in
employment last month was seen in the services industry, which has accounted
for three-quarters of jobs created in the past year.
This increase, however, was largely offset by sharp decline in construction
which was adversely affected by severe storms on the east coast last month.
Manufacturing employment fell slightly.
The jobs figures caused concern following several weak figures this week,
including a decline in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index.
There was also a fall in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of
conditions in the manufacturing industry. However, other statistics remain
more encouraging.
The University of Michigan's confidence index was higher at the end of March
than at the beginning, although it remained slightly down for the month.

FT  03 APR 93 / Heseltine recruits top companies for panel: DTI will use
secret data to monitor economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is recruiting some
of the UK's biggest companies to help him turn his department into an
economic powerhouse to rival the Treasury.
The venture should enable Mr Heseltine to monitor economic activity
independently of the Treasury, which has run into criticism over its failure
to forecast the length or seriousness of the recession.
The group of about 20 companies, including J. Sainsbury, Imperial Chemical
Industries and Marks and Spencer, would give Mr Heseltine confidential
information about their sales trends in the crucial period as Britain
attempts to move into an upturn. The group - which will also include
Northern Foods, TI Group and Unigate - would also advise Mr Heseltine on
long-term industrial goals.
The project marks another stage in the government's efforts to set up a new
dialogue with industry after the Thatcher era gave it a lower priority.
The Treasury's role as the dominant force in economic policy making has been
made less secure both by recession and last autumn's currency crisis which
swept Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
While ICI and Marks and Spencer said they were still considering Mr
Heseltine's invitation, Mr Tony Sumner, a director of TI, said his company
would take part. 'The more government and industry can get together the
better,' he said.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said his company 'will be
happy to play a role', while Sainsbury and Northern Foods have also
indicated willingness to participate. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of
Nor-thern Foods, said: 'By gathering the anecdotal experiences of people in
industry, Mr Heseltine may be able to improve on the Treasury's more
academic approach to monitoring the economy.'
The Treasury, which has stepped up its contacts with industry, welcomed Mr
Heseltine's plan and hoped to share the information gained.
A formal announcement is expected within the next few weeks. Companies in
the scheme are to send DTI officials commercially sensitive sales
information about important parts of their business that provide clues to
economic activity, both in the UK and overseas. The data would supplement
economic statistics gathered from government or industry surveys, which
during the recession have often given a misleading or confused picture of
economic activity.
Top executives would meet Mr Heseltine perhaps twice a year to thrash out
ideas about long-term industrial goals.

FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Philip Morris compounds early
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A PROFITS warning from Philip Morris, and an unexpected drop in non-farm
payrolls, combined with higher interest rates to push US share prices
sharply lower yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68.63 at 3,370.81,
its lowest level in a month. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended down 8.92 at 441.38, while the Amex composite was down 5.25 at 417.52,
and the Nasdaq composite down 16.81 at 669.83. Trading volume on the NYSE
was 326m shares.
Trading throughout the day was volatile and confusing. Before business
opened, the Labor department published the March employment report, which
showed that non-farm payrolls had fallen by 22,000 last month. Analysts had
been expecting a rise of as much as 100,000.
Although bond prices initially firmed on the news, they quickly reversed
course after economists attributed the unexpectedly weak figure to bad
weather, and noted that both January and February payrolls were revised
upward - indicating a still relatively robust trend in payroll growth.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond had dropped by more than a
point, pushing the yield back above 7 per cent for the first time in six
weeks. This sharp rise in interest rates unnerved equity investors, who were
also unhappy about the jobs data.
Matters were complicated by the effect on the market of an announcement from
Philip Morris that its operating earnings from the company's domestic
tobacco businesses (which make up almost half of the group's profits) would
fall by as much as 40 per cent this year. Philip Morris said that it planned
to slash prices on its most popular cigarette brand in an attempt to halt
the decline in its market share.
The news sparked heavy selling of the stock, so heavy that trading in Philip
Morris shares did not open for more than an hour, meaning that the impact of
the story on the Dow was delayed. The index was down only a few points at
10.30am, but when trading in Philip Morris started, the Dow plunged another
30 points. After that, the index was never able to stage a recovery, and
ended close to its lows for the day.
Volume was extremely heavy at 26m shares. Other tobacco stocks were sharply
lower, with American Brands down Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 30, RJR Nabisco
Dollars 1 1/4 weaker at Dollars 6 3/4 , and Loews down Dollars 16 3/8 at
Dollars 94.
Cable television stocks continued to suffer from Thursday's news of
regulatory-imposed price controls. Time Warner fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
30 3/4 and, on the Nasdaq, Comcast dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 17 3/4
and TCI fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices followed New York's lead and closed lower in active
trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index fell 19.48
points, or 0.54 per cent, to close at 3,595.07, for a loss on the week of
just 5 points. Losing issues led winners by 372 to 325 and 59.524m shares
changed hands at a value of CDollars 526.1m, compared with Thursday's totals
of 66.544m shares worth CDollars 538.7m.

FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan peaks again after remarkable
quarter - Taipei is up by more than 50 per cent this year as the 'Big Hands'
return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Chinese lunar year has brought an end to a three-year slump in the
Taiwan stock market. Its weighted index hit a new 1993 high yesterday, up
153.45, or 3.2 per cent to 4,948.62 on interest rate hopes. This leaves it
up 7.5 per cent on the week, and by 57 per cent since its 1993 low on
January 9.
Turnover has returned to levels unseen since the heady days of 1989.
Yesterday it was an active TDollars 77.65bn (USDollars 3bn) against
Thursday's TDollars 74.67bn. As far back as March 4 it hit TDollars 99.3bn,
a sign that Taiwan's speculative retail investors, and so-called 'Big
Hands', had finally returned. The atmosphere could not have been more in
contrast with the despondent days of 1992, and while short-term
profit-taking will continue, the index looks set to go higher.
The catalyst for the market's resurgence was the short-term resolution of
the political rift that had been threatening to tear apart the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) party. February's resignation of the ageing conservative
premier, Hau Pei-tsun, and his replacement by an acolyte of the more liberal
President Lee Teng-hui, has put an end to government dissension,
temporarily, and within the public arena.
Mr Hau was one of Chiang Kai-shek's mainland supporters who came over from
China in 1949, and he was the figurehead of the traditional right wing of
the party.
He openly opposed the reformist and pro-business approach of the country's
first Taiwan-born president, Lee Teng-hui, and Hau's demise is seen,
therefore, as a positive sign for the stock market.
The easing of the confrontation may be superficial, but no further political
confrontations are likely, at least until the party congress in July and
August. This has been enough to trigger a significant recovery in share
prices, although the rally has had a very narrow base.
The banking sector, which represents close to 35 per cent of the market's
capitalisation, has accounted for the bulk of the stock market's gains. This
partly reflects the stronger fundamentals of the sector which, historically,
has benefited from a higher interest rate environment.
It was spurred further by the fact that the appointed premier, Lien Chan, is
a big shareholder in the three provincial government-owned banks.
Following the market's meteoric rise this year, SG Warburg Securities now
estimates that the TSE index is trading on a 1993 prospective price-earnings
ratio of 31.
The figure is inflated by the extremely high p/e's of the banking stocks,
and by the aggressive depreciation policies of Taiwanese companies, but it
still appears expensive compared with other markets in south-east Asia. Hong
Kong is on a 1993 p/e of 10.9, and Thailand is on 13.4, according to Warburg
forecasts.
However, Taiwan is finally back on an upward economic growth track,
following lower gross national product growth of 6 per cent in 1992. Greater
optimism is demonstrated by Formosa Plastic's announcement that it is to go
ahead with a new USDollars 7.5bn naptha cracker plant.
Electronics exporters, meanwhile, have experienced a strong pick-up in
orders from the US, but the sector has been dogged by the US Special 301
investigation, which is likely to give rise to some caution for the entire
stock market.
Talks between the US and Taiwan over copyright protection have broken down,
and Taiwan has until April 15 to make sufficient concessions, or the US will
establish retaliatory tariffs on a hit list of export products, which could
cost the island up to USDollars 1bn.
Another focus of attention will be the impending quasi-official talks
between Taiwan and China, which are due to take place in Singapore during
April. The discussions between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and
Beijing's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits are likely to
address the contentious issue of direct investment and transport links
between the two 'countries'.
An agreement on direct links would be positive for business and equities,
and many observers expect that an agreement will be finalised during 1993.
A number of brokers are confident that the index will hit 6,000 by the
year-end. But in a market which is dominated by short-term trading,
psychological resistance at the 5,000-level is a more immediate concern, and
a period of consolidation is on the cards.

FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 1.8% to
three-year high

INDIVIDUALS, foreigners, and dealers placed heavy buying orders, and the
Nikkei average rose 1.8 per cent in volume of 1.5bn shares, the largest
since November 29 1989, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed up 347.85 at 19,446.94, 2.1 per cent higher on the week and
a new high for the year. It opened at the day's low of 19,136.03, and peaked
at 19,750.93 before declining on late profit-taking.
Volume surged from Thursday's 685m as some Japanese institutional investors,
who had previously refrained from buying, started to purchase shares.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 886 to 227 with 66 unchanged, the Topix
index of all first-section stocks jumped 55.12 to 1,526.31 and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 8.69 to 1,200.65.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone once again led the rise. The issue closed up
Y23,000 at Y1m, climbing above the Y1m level for the first time since April
1991.
Securities houses were strong, pushing the sector up to the day's top
position with a rise of 11.9 per cent. Nomura Securities soared Y220 to
Y2,190 and Daiwa Securities rose by Y150 to Y1,270.
Large lot buying in Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day as it
gained Y60 to Y405, boosted other steels and shipbuilders. NKK rose Y55 to
Y340 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y29 to Y659. Some exporters
were weak on the stronger yen. The dollar closed down Y0.54 at Y114 after
briefly trading on the Y113 level during the morning session.
In Osaka, the OSE average climbed 763.04 to 21,070.88 in volume of 60.1m
shares. The index regained the 21,000 level for the first time since May 21.
Roundup
Some strong performances were recorded in Pacific Rim markets.
SINGAPORE blue chips were in demand by foreign investors and the Straits
Times Industrial index rose 12.8 to a record closing high of 1,688.96, 1.7
per cent higher on the week.
With the end of the corporate reporting season, investors were said to be
taking a positive view of longer term prospects.
In particular, the government's plan to privatise Singapore Telecom, and its
forecast of stronger economic growth this year, are expected to continue to
help investor sentiment.
AUSTRALIA overcame an uncertain start and rallied to its highest close in 10
months on futures-related trading and positive economic news. The All
Ordinaries index added 14.3 to 1,683.1, 0.5 per cent higher on the week.
Investors welcomed the statement by Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, that
arrangements which effectively allow companies to pay tax-free dividends
were safe, as well as his commitment to reduce the budget deficit.
A big premium on futures and the strong performance in Tokyo also encouraged
buyers. June share price index futures jumped 10.2 to 1705.0 on the Sydney
Futures Exchange, giving it a 21.9 point premium to the physical market.
SEOUL ended convincingly higher in brisk trade in response to a batch of
recent indicators which showed an improvement in economic activity. The
composite index closed 15.76 higher at 681.37, 3.3 per cent up on the week.
HONG KONG, closed on Monday for a local holiday, recovered most of its early
losses in a late round of bargain hunting by foreign investors. The Hang
Seng index ended 4.44 lower at 6,404.44, 1 per cent up on the week, after
lagging by more than 25 points for most of the day. Turnover was a slack
HKDollars 3.15bn.
BOMBAY moved ahead on renewed buying support from investment institutions
when trading resumed yesterday after Thursday's holiday and the BSE index
rose 30.92 to 2,311.44, a 1.2 per cent decline on the week.

FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler, Hoechst take a tumble
in the post-bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE stories moved a number of bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT ended the official week virtually unchanged with the DAX index
9.83 lower on the day at 1,661.75 in turnover up from DM4.6bn to DM4.8bn.
But after hours, things happened.
First, Hoechst confirmed a police report that a gas cloud consisting of a
form of sulphuric acid was released in an accident shortly before 1300 GMT;
and that it was heading south from the Hoechst plant on the outskirts of
Frankfurt.
There was an all-clear later but Hoechst, accident-prone lately and now the
least attractive of the big three chemicals in terms of dividend yield, was
DM3.80 down at DM247.80 after hours, as BASF eased 50 pfg to DM237.60 and
Bayer rose DM1.20 to DM276.70.
Next, Daimler moved the merger with Mercedes AG which was the subject of
speculation a week ago. Mercedes, DM3 lower at DM490.50 at the close, owns
25.2 per cent of Daimler, which closed DM7 lower yesterday at DM610.50, on a
share-for-share basis.
The deal should ease Daimler's problems with rights issue pricing, save it
tax on dividends next year and, said Mr Hans Peter Wodniok of James Capel in
Frankfurt, help in the provision of shares required for the Daimler listing
in New York.
However, as Mercedes ended Ibis late trading at DM575, DM84.50 up from its
bourse close, Daimler wavered between DM490 and DM500.
PARIS fell on position-squaring, the CAC-40 index ending 15.07 lower at
1,990.82, 1.7 per cent down on the week in turnover of FFr2.95bn.
CarnaudMetalBox, the packaging group, fell FFr9, or 4.2 per cent to FFr208
after suspension, and the announcement that a 25.3 per cent stake owned by
MB Caradon had been successfully placed with CGIP, Parfinance, and SG
Warburg.
Peugeot Citroen lost FFr10, ending at FFr564 in 95,000 shares on the 9 per
cent drop in French car registrations in March. Registrations of Peugeot
cars declined by 10.9 per cent.
The glass and building materials group, Saint Gobain, continued to lose
ground. After its 6.6 per cent drop on Thursday, the stock fell another
FFr8, or 1.6 per cent lower at FFr490 on the chairman's pessimistic view of
prospects.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed with the CBS Tendency index unchanged on the day, and
little changed on the week at 106.8.
Nutricia, the baby foods maker, rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 131,50 amid rumours that
it was a takeover target, although the company said it knew of no attempted
bid. The rumours began after Unigate, which has a 27.8 per cent stake, told
the Financial Times that changes in the relationship between the two
companies were possible.
Aegon was marked Fl 1.50 lower to Fl 85.90 in response to Thursday's
results. Fokker eased 10 cents to Fl 13.30 ahead of its announcement after
the bourse closed of a 74 per cent drop in 1992 profits.
ZURICH's SMI index edged 1.9 higher to 2,190.3, matching the all-time high
recorded on Wednesday, for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week.
CS Holding continued its advance, adding SFr30 to SFr2,380, supported by buy
recommendations from several London brokers. Bearers in Von Roll fell SFr80
or 10.9 per cent to SFr650, after the steelmaker warning on Thursday that it
expected a loss for the current year.
MILAN was broadly weaker with the the lira's fall to record lows against the
D-mark only adding to political uncertainty. The Comit index eased 4.29 to
475.44, for a weekly fall of 2.3 per cent.
Fiat pulled other shares down, fixing L175 or 3 per cent lower at L5,651
before picking up to L5,690 after hours.
Companies controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti moved against the trend after
newspaper reports that a restructuring plan was being considered. Premafin
rose L290 or 6.2 per cent to settle at L4,920 before L4,975 on the kerb.
MADRID's general index closed 2.01 lower at 237.65, 0.4 per cent down on the
week. The two main features were a 3.3 per cent fall to Pta1,300 in Acesa,
the most liquid of the four Spanish motorway operators, and a 1.4 per cent
decline to Pta3,770 in Tabacalera.
Acesa dropped on rights issue rumours although, according to Mr Christopher
Cooper at James Capel, the prospect is already built into the rating.
Tabacalera reacted to the threat of an international price war in cigarettes
following the news on pricing from Philip Morris in the US.
ISTANBUL continued its advance, adding 236.15 or 3.9 per cent to an
all-time-high of 6,307.01, for a weekly rise of 11.5 per cent.

FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gains reversed in an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIFFICULT and confusing session, distorted by heavy falls in Wellcome and
in BAT Industries, saw the UK stock market gyrate through a range of more
than 33 points on the Footsie scale before closing 8.5 down on the day. In
addition to the setback to prospects for Retrovir, Wellcome's HIV treatment
product, and to BAT's sales outlook following a statement from Philip Morris
of the US, London traders had to cope with an erratic pound and weakness in
other European markets and on Wall Street - and all against the backcloth of
a UK rail strike which delayed commuters and reduced attendance in the City
of London.
In the event, around 4.6 per cent of market volume, and all of the net loss
in the Footsie, reflected heavy activity in BAT and in Wellcome. The rest of
the market was fairly quiet as it moved to the end of the first week of a
trading account extended to cover the Easter holiday weekend.
After opening cautiously, equities brushed off Wellcome's heavy fall, and
moved ahead as a strong futures market set the pace. The success of this
week's Pounds 3bn auction of government bonds continued to help gilts, which
soon put on three quarters of a point.
This encouraged the Bank of England to announce that a further Pounds 500m
of conventional gilts and Pounds 150m of index-linked would be available for
sale to the market on April 5. Bonds held up well, long dates closing more
than  1/2 up and index-linked around  1/4 better.
Confidence in equities was further boosted by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, who said there could be 'little doubt' that
over the past month, every economic indicator had pointed to recovery.
Better news on the housing market, and an opinion poll report of increased
economic optimism in the UK since the Budget of March 16, helped take the
Footsie ahead by 19.1 to 2,897.5.
But the market refused to challenge the Footsie 2,500 mark and trod water
until first reports from the Philip Morris meeting sent BAT plunging.
London was also perturbed that poor US jobs data might upset Wall Street.
The FT-SE Index continued to slide, showing a fall of 13.9 on the day just
before Wall Street opened with a loss of 30 Dow points.
The final ninety minutes of trading brought a modest rally, as the Dow also
steadied for a time from its initial setback. At its final reading of
2,869.9, the FT-SE was 8.5 down after a highly erratic trading day.
Seaq trading volume, although boosted by heavy selling of Wellcome and BAT
Industries, fell to 606.6m shares from Thursday's 678m.

FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP decline on Wall Street, along with poor news on the UK corporate
sector, put pressure on the Footsie futures contract, leaving it to
surrender earlier gains, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,887, good solid demand for the June contract on the FT-SE
saw it advance steadily and by 12.30pm it was trading at 2,916. It
maintained the early momentum over the lunchtime period, but the heavy falls
in BAT and the poor form in New York proved too much to resist and the early
buyers used the negative mood for profit-taking leading to a decline in the
contract.
It closed at 2,872, down 22 on its previous close and around 6 points below
its fair value premium to cash of about 11. Turnover was around 9,000 lots.
Volume in the traded options improved reaching 28,697 by the close. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 6,533 and the Euro FT-SE option traded 4,534.
Hanson was the busiest stock option at 2,418, followed by Pilkington at
1,223.

FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Delay hurts Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prolongation of a Monopolies and Merger Commission (MMC) inquiry hit British
Gas shares as some securities houses argued that this would cause continued
uncertainty for the company and shareholders.
The MMC inquiry was expected to conclude at the end of April but it was
announced late on Thursday that it would be delayed until the end of July.
Hoare Govett and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull were selling stock on the
uncertainty.
Dealers said Kleinwort Benson and UBS were buyers of Gas, and that there was
a two-way pull which left the shares 6 down at 308 1/2 p with active
turnover of just under 10m.
Negative sentiment surrounding Wellcome helped to depress parts of the drugs
sector. Glaxo fell 11 to 579p and Fisons lost 4 at 198p. However SmithKline
Beecham gained as analysts spoke about the prospects for a rival drug to
Wellcome's headline anti-herpes treatment Zovirax and in delayed reaction to
a company presentation in the US this week. SmithKline shares lifted 14 1/2
in the 'A's to 422p and 10 in the Units to 365p.
Chemicals group BOC fell 18 to 720p as some analysts cut forecasts.
Stores stocks, which led the market's morning charge, faded rapidly,
although most managed to remain on the positive side of the ledger.
Particularly strong was Kingfisher, the shares surging 11 to 589p in
turnover of 2.2m. There were a number of positive brokers in support of the
stock. NatWest Securities was among them, the B&amp;Q home improvement arm the
focus of its strong buy recommendation. Others were pointing to improved
sales figures from Darty, the French electrical retailer bought by
Kingfisher for Pounds 560m in February. However, there were also some
dissenting voices in the market warning of the dangers of the stock
overunning.
Several retailers benefited from the good results turned in by Next on
Thursday. Burton Group spurted forward, but slipped to close 1 1/2 ahead at
80 1/2 p in turnover of 3m. Great Universal Stores added 30 to 1613p,
Storehouse 3 to 204p and Next a penny to 173p.
There were further whispers heard on sales at Marks and Spencer, with food
and womenswear both said to be particularly strong. The shares firmed a
penny to 345p. More speculation over prospects for Dixons' US businesses saw
the shares gain 6 to 211p.
After several sessions in the doldrums, Argyll Group was wanted with dealers
suggesting the stock had fallen far enough. The shares lifted 11 to 341p
with turnover reaching a hefty 7.8m.
The effect of Ladbroke Group's scrip dividend offer, which came after the
market had closed on Thursday, failed to affect the shares which, after an
initial spurt, slipped to close steady at 176p. The offer is for new
ordinary shares to the value of 9.34p for each ordinary share. This equates
to 8.88p, or half as much again as the 1992 final dividend of 6.23p, in cash
terms. Leisure specialists predict the offer should benefit the shares by
around 5 per cent.
Profit-taking continued in Euro Disney following last week's flurry of
information on the theme park's performance. The shares fell 35 to 1085p.
Shares in building products and printing company MB-Caradon improved 2 to
320p after the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, 163
lighter at 2475p.
Selling of Smiths Industries continued, leaving the shares another 8 lighter
at 321p. However, NatWest Securities believes the shares have fallen far
enough and predicted a bounce.
'A dead cat bounce' is how one trader described the improvement in BM Group,
up 3 at 21p. A profits upgrading from Carr Kitcat was said to have prompted
the improvement in T &amp; N, 3 better at 189p.

FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome plummets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price plummet following news
that its anti-AIDS drug Retrovir might be ineffective for the millions of
people who are early stage carriers of the virus.
The news, prompted by the most extensive and enduring trial of the drug to
date, caused Wellcome shares to fall by more than 10 per cent to a low of
658p shortly after the start of trading yesterday. However, they recovered
in the afternoon and closed 51 lower at 692p. The share price was also
sharply lower at the start of trading in New York.
The wave of heavy selling saw 10m shares traded within the first two hours
of dealing and by the close 15m shares had changed hands. Aside from the
unusual volumes at the time of Wellcome's 270m share issue in July, this was
the heaviest volume for almost four years.
Dealers said there was heavy international offloading and one added that
busy institutional UK selling had still not been absorbed by the end of the
day and predicted further falls. However, many analysts were keen to point
out that the shares now stood on a p/e ratio below that of the overall
market which, in a traditionally highly rated sector, could only imply a
buying opportunity.

FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tobacco stocks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in international trading group BAT Industries dived after Philip
Morris, its US tobacco rival, surprised the market by announcing a profits
warning and signalled the start of a cigarette price war to boost sales of
its Marlboro brand.
The first half of the session saw strong demand for BAT which sent the
shares climbing 16 to 1015p. Enthusiasts expected a further advance in the
afternoon ahead of a clutch of brokers' recommendations early next week.
However, the announcement from Philip Morris sent BAT plunging on fears that
a price war might have a severe effect on the group's current year profits.
The shares closed near the day's low, down 71 1/2 at 927 1/2 p, with a hefty
14m traded by the close.
Hoare Govett moved the stock from a buy to a hold and indicated it could be
shaving the current-year forecast by around Pounds 120m to about Pounds
2.1bn. But, Mr Chris Alexander at Lehman Brothers remained confident about
the underlying performance of the company and said yesterday's price fall
'had been overdone given BAT's exposure to the US market.'
Rothmans was also affected. The shares fell 18 to 657p.

FT  03 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dramatic recovery by dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rebounded dramatically against the D-Mark in yesterday's late
afternoon trading in Europe, despite a poorer-than-expected US employment
report for March, writes James Blitz.
The March non-farm payroll figure, by far the most important indicator for
dollar investors, showed a net decrease of 22,000 against market
expectations of an 80,000 rise.
Its immediate impact was to push the dollar sharply lower against the German
currency, from about DM1.5950 just before the figure was announced, to a low
of the day of DM1.5875.
However, the dollar's fall triggered an intense bout of short covering by
foreign exchange dealers. In what one analyst called 'a classic day in the
currency market', dealers turned on their heels after about half an hour of
dollar selling.
They pushed the dollar up nearly 3 pfennigs in less than two hours to a high
of the day of DM1.6160. The US currency later closed in London at DM1.6050,
more than  1/2 a pfennig up on the day. After losing a lot of ground to
sterling at the start of the day, the dollar closed nearly a cent higher
against the pound at Dollars 1.5175.
The dollar's rebound came after closer examination of the payroll figure
itself. Although the March figure was weak, the astonishing figure for
February was actually revised up from an increase of 365,000 to one of
367,000.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, believes
that both the February and March figures taken together are positive for the
dollar. 'There are 150,000 jobs being created every month in the US and that
adds up to a recovery,' he said.
He also believes that the dollar proved to be well underpinned technically.
He said that the 130-day moving average for the dollar yesterday was
DM1.5890, and the currency was unable to break convincingly through that
support level.
However, the market appears to be divided over where the dollar is going
from here.
Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation, a long time dollar bear,
believes that the dollar could see some short-term appreciation, but will
later dip to DM1.52 at the very least.
'The US economy,' he says, 'is stuck with a tremendous structural problem.
Even if we are not going back to a full blown recession, the speed of
recovery is disappointing.'
He also believes that the franc fort policy of the French authorities must
be solidified in the next few weeks, and that this will attract strong
support from the German authorities and investment in French bonds.

FT  03 APR 93 / Money Markets: A change of mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a hectic week in sterling markets, dealers yesterday went home for
the weekend with no clear view on whether UK base rates were set to go lower
than 6 per cent, writes James Blitz.
By the close of trading yesterday, the yield curve from one month out to 1
year in the sterling interbank market was perfectly flat.
That was a significant indication of the market's mood. The curve has moved
from a downward sloping one to general flatness this week. If it starts to
move upwards, this will be the first indication since the September sterling
crisis that the market expects base rates to rise.
There is still some bullishness on rate cuts in the market. With most cash
rates at around 5 7/8 per cent, there are signs that some dealers expect a
small easing soon.
But there has been an overall change in sentiment, inspired by comments from
the UK authorities that they do not want to see policy ease for the near
future.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, has had an
especially strong impact on the market, suggesting that he wanted sterling
to have a higher exchange rate.
Dealers also believe that the new signs of growth in the UK economy make
another base rate cut unnecessary. Thursday's M0 money supply figure,
showing growth of around 5 per cent, underlined this view.
Even the futures dealers who tried to push up the short dated sterling
contracts at the start of the week have ended up losing money.
Tensions between the government and Britain's building societies over the
high rates of interest offered by National Savings Bonds had raised
expectations of another base rate cut.
But the row has petered out, and the June contract, having been as high as
94.40 earlier in the week, closed last night at 94.18.
There is always a possibility that aggressive cuts in German rates might
open the window for another easing in UK policy. But, here again, the market
was disappointed this week.
Certainly, there was a sharp drop in call money, from about 8.75 per cent
last Friday to 8.25 per cent last night. But the Bundesbank's official rates
were unchanged, and the cut in the repo rate was a modest 8 basis points to
8.17 per cent.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits fall moderated by hidden
reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET GROUP earnings at Daimler-Benz fell by 25 per cent last year and by more
than 40 per cent at the German parent company.
Although the slump had been well signalled, the vehicles, aerospace and
engineering group's shares lost DM9 on the Frankfurt stock exchange after
the formal announcement yesterday, closing at DM610.50.
Consolidated group profits of DM1.45bn (Dollars 907m), compared with
DM1.94bn in 1991, were in line with warnings from the company of a result
around DM1.5bn, following an unexpected slump in the third quarter of the
year.
The proposed dividend was confirmed at an unchanged DM13.
Income at Daimler-Benz AG, the holding parent, was artificially inflated to
DM5.19bn by extraordinary 'earnings' of DM4.49bn.
These were previously hidden reserves stemming from the adjusted valuation
of group pension provisions and inventories.
They have now been revealed as part of a recent disclosure agreement with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows Daimler shares to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Excluding this figure, profits were just DM703m, compared with DM1.194bn.
The group has proposed that the once-hidden reserves be used to strengthen
its debt-to-equity ratio and paid into its paid-up equity.
The SEC had demanded more transparency and disclosure as part of the
compromise deal which will make Daimler the first German company to gain
NYSE listing.
The deal, after negotiations lasting around four years, is expected to
encourage other German companies which had previously been discouraged by
disclosure requirements.
Although Daimler had made concessions to the SEC, it was not a question of
'unconditional surrender', according to Mr Gerhard Liener, group finance
director.
Explaining the commission's acceptance of the deal, he said it was the SEC's
job not to stand in the way but to help new business.
Mr Liener stressed the advantages of a listing in an investment market worth
around Dollars 50bn a year compared with Germany, which he expected to be
burdened in future by privatisation plans.

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft producer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent drop
in 1992 net profits and warned that prolonged recession and the cost of
planned redundancies would further depress this year's results.
Net profits fell to Fl 20m (Dollars 11.17m), from an adjusted Fl 77m, on
sales of Fl 4.08bn. Operating results were steady at Fl 131.3m, against Fl
134.6m in 1991. Final earnings were depressed by heavy financing costs, up
from Fl 62m to Fl 126m. The group will forgo a dividend payment for the
year.
Fokker, in which Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary is to take a
majority stake, recently unveiled plans to cut production and trim its
workforce by 2,118 from the present 12,500 by year-end.
The job cuts are expected to save the group some Fl 270m in annual wages,
but will initially entail heavy, but as-yet undetermined, costs.

shield

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ is to abandon its main protection against an unwelcome takeover
by dissolving a special holding company that owns 25 per cent of its shares.
Mercedes Holding was set up in 1975 to stop the Shah of Iran from buying a
big stake in Germany's biggest industrial company.
The Mercedes Holding shares will be converted into Daimler shares later this
year on a one-for-one basis, Daimler said yesterday. The holding company has
no connection with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary and, although
quoted, its sole purpose is to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler.
The announcement prompted a sharp drop in Daimler's share price and is
likely to lead to a significant increase in the price of Mercedes Holding
shares on Monday. They are on a 20 per cent discount to Daimler shares.
The move will be seen as a victory for shareholder rights activists who last
January launched a campaign for the abolition of the holding company.
Analysts said the move was linked with Daimler's decision to list on the New
York Stock Exchange later this year, where such shareholding structures are
viewed as anachronistic and contrary to the interests of institutional
investors.
The break-up of the company will also help Daimler in its long-frustrated
plans to hold a DM2bn rights issue, originally intended for last year but
postponed due to poor conditions on the German equity market. For technical
reasons, the holding company makes it difficult to raise equity capital, as
Daimler intends to do next year.
Mercedes Holding was put together at the initiative of Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank and biggest shareholder in Daimler with a 28 per cent
stake.
In the mid-1970s, Mr Friedrich Karl Flick, the industrialist, wanted to sell
the bulk of his 39 cent stake in Daimler to Iran. Deutsche Bank objected,
fearing that the crown jewels of German industry would end up being
controlled from the Gulf. The bank bought 25 per cent itself, before selling
it on to the newly-created special holding company.
Half of its shares are owned by two holding companies, Stella Automobil and
Stern Automobil, which are in turn owned by a number of banks and industrial
companies, including Allianz, the insurer, as well as Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank, Germany's second and third biggest banks, and Robert Bosch, the
car components company.
The remaining shares are owned by around 60,000 individual and institutional
shareholders, which collect a dividend from Daimler but have no direct vote
in the industrial conglomerate's affairs.
Daimler refused to comment yesterday on what would happen to the shares
owned by Stella and Stern. Analysts speculated that some of the shares could
be used to sell to US investors in connection with the New York listing.
Some explained the fall in the Daimler share price yesterday as reflecting
perceptions that large blocks of shares would now come on to the market.

Output of the 50-seat twin-turboprop Fokker 50 will be cut from 27 to 20 by
1994, and the number of new 100-seat Fokker 100 twin-jets will fall from 59
to 40 in 1995.
The job cuts are expected to save the group some Fl 270m in annual wages,
although the rationalisation will initially entail heavy, but as-yet
undetermined, costs.
Fokker, while welcoming Thursday's approval of the takeover by the
Daimler-Benz supervisory board, said 1993 would be 'a year of adjustment to
the altered circumstances', adding profits would remain under pressure.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Court orders VW to stop
recruiting Opel executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN was yesterday threatened with fines and a possible prison
sentence for one of its executives if it continued trying to recruit senior
managers from rival carmaker Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General
Motors.
Opel won a temporary injunction in a Frankfurt court yesterday barring its
loss-making competitor from 'systematically recruiting or attempting to
recruit Opel and General Motors employees'.
The order, issued by three judges, followed Thursday's public accusations
from Opel that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former head of GM's
worldwide purchasing operation who joined VW last month, had been directly
involved in a systematic attempt to 'poach' more than 40 of Opel's German
procurement managers by offering to double their salaries.
The injunction threatened VW with fines of up to DM500,000 (Dollars 315,000)
and Mr Lopez with up to six months' jail. A spokesman for VW could not
comment last night because the order had not yet been received. But the
company had been advised it had 'acted legally', he said.
Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, said last night he had resorted to legal
remedies because his company needed to be protected. 'It was difficult to
decide whether to demand that they stop, or to simply protect ourselves,' he
added.
'Had he (Mr Lopez) got all the people he called here, he would have hurt us
really badly,' Mr Herman said.
VW's tactics, understood already to have attracted almost 20 people from
Opel and from GM in Detroit in three months, are threatening the industry's
usually close inter-company relationships as car makers face a 10 per cent
fall in Europe-wide demand and 20 per cent fall in Germany.
Mr Herman wrote earlier this week to all German motor makers, politicians
and the industry association protesting about VW's actions. 'How can I sit
there with Mr Piech (the VW chairman) when he is trying to destroy my
company from within?' he asked.
VW, which earlier this week announced a DM1.25bn first-quarter loss, hired
Mr Lopez from GM to use his renowned skills as a procurement director in a
bid to imitate Opel's successful cost-cutting programme.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Four European airlines set 1997
target for combined operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Swissair and
Austrian Airlines are considering merging in four years to create Europe's
largest airline group.
Mr Leo van Weigk, one of the three board members of KLM, confirmed yesterday
that the four medium-sized European airlines were studying full integration
of their operations by 1997.
The four are seeking to create what they call a 'fourth force' in the
European airline industry to compete against the big three European carriers
 -British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany.
Although the four carriers are considering a full merger, this is likely to
take several years to complete because of the airlines' complicated
shareholding structures and problems over their respective international
landing rights.
The four carriers have set up 16 working parties to study various aspects of
co-operation leading eventually to a possible merger. Their conclusions are
expected to be put to the boards of the airlines in two weeks.
KLM said yesterday that the four boards were expected to reach a decision on
future co-operation and a possible merger next month.
Before any final proposal is decided it would have to be reviewed by the
European Commission, the shareholders and unions of the four airlines, as
well as by the north American anti-trust authorities.
This process could take a further six months, KLM suggested.
If successful, this could lead to closer collaboration between the four
airlines through a joint management group next year.
The joint operation could combine the sales, computer reservation systems
and fleet maintenance of the four airlines.
The concept at this stage would be to provide the benefits of a merger
without a full merger.
The combined operations of the four carriers would create one of Europe's
biggest airline groups, with a fleet of more than 270 aircraft carrying 30m
passengers a year and employing around 80,000 people.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho plays down rights hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RENE Leclezio, chairman of Lonrho, yesterday said the international
trading conglomerate was considering another rights issue.
However, the conglomerate's financial advisers moved quickly to dampen
expectations of an imminent rights issue. One said: 'It was not part of the
prepared script. Mr Leclezio was simply speaking off the cuff. There are no
immediate plans for another rights issue.'
Questioned by shareholders at the annual meeting, Mr Leclezio said: 'Very
soon we will be able, we might even need a rights issue. It would need to be
at a deep discount to the market price at the time.'
Lonrho's recent rights issue was priced at 85p a share compared to the 72p
price of its ordinary shares at the time.
Some shareholders expressed unhappiness that the rights was priced above the
market price. Lonrho's shares yesterday fell 1 1/2 p to 83 1/2 p.
At a subdued, although generally supportive meeting, Mr Leclezio denied that
there was any 'black hole' in the conglomerate's accounts.
He said: 'I often read unjustified press comments implying that there is
something hidden, or something to hide in Lonrho's accounts. There is no
black hole.'
Mr Leclezio also told shareholders that Lonrho's capital expenditure
programme was coming to an end, and he said that by the next AGM he may have
a big new acquisition to talk about.
'I hope by next year to be able to tell you of a further acquisition,' he
said.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV director survives investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALLAN McKeown, the controversial managing director of SelecTV, the
independent production company, has survived an investigation by the
company's solicitors, Richards Butler.
The solicitors were asked to conduct a detailed investigation following the
issuing of a writ last month against Mr McKeown alleging irregularities in
the way the company was run. The writ was never served.
SelecTV, which makes programmes such as Lovejoy and Birds of a Feather, said
last night it would issue a full statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday
giving the results of the Richards Butler review.
It is clear that, following the investigation, Mr McKeown will be fully
reinstated with the support of the SelecTV board.
The company is, however, expected to take note of points made about its
standards of corporate governance.

FT  03 APR 93 / Week in the Markets: Breath of fresh air for gold bulls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market moved out of the doldrums this week, bringing excitement
back to the precious metals sector.
The rise began on Tuesday on trade buying in Europe. US funds pushed prices
higher, and the London bullion market broke through two important technical
barriers at Dollars 334 and Dollars 336 a troy ounce to finish at Dollars
336.15, a rise of Dollars 4.30 over Monday.
Such a bullish move spilled over into the silver and platinum markets.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
pointed out that while volume had been thin, 'for a change producers did not
spoil the show by selling forward.' This was probably because the Australian
dollar price of gold had fallen, while the US dollar price was still
relatively low.
The rally continued full steam ahead early on Wednesday, taking the price
above Dollars 340 a troy ounce. But the market closed at Dollars 337.80, a
rise of only Dollars 1.70, leading to some suggestions that the rally would
be short-lived as the Australian dollar was weakening and the price was near
its peak in South African rand terms.
However, Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of the American Precious
Metals Advisors consultancy organisation, suggested in his latest MetalsFax:
'In my view only a new wave of big sales can keep gold prices down.'
He was particularly encouraged by the recent interest of institutional and
substantial private investors in the gold share market.
'Retail (gold) investment activity in America and Europe - judging by demand
for bullion coins and small bars - is showing renewed signs of life,' he
said.
On Thursday the entire precious metals market eased on light profit-taking.
But all the charts - described by one observer as 'orgasmic' in technical
terms - were indicating a breakthrough into a higher range.
Yesterday the London bullion market was once again on the upward trail, with
a morning fix of Dollars 339.40 and an afternoon fix at Dollars 340.10 - the
highest level since October last year.
News that Singapore had imported a record 414 tonnes of gold last year
compared with 270 tonnes in 1991 added fuel to the flames, confirming the
strength of demand in the Far East.
Gold closed after a busy day at Dollars 339.75 a troy ounce, ahead Dollars
7.30 on the week, and dealers expect it to move into a new range above
Dollars 340 a troy ounce next week.
Silver closed at 394.50 cents a troy ounce, up 22.50 on the week, and
appears poised to move above 400 cents. Platinum closed at Dollars 365.50 a
troy ounce, up Dollars 9.90 on the week.
In contrast with the precious metals markets base metal prices on the London
Metal Exchange have had a quiet week. The rise in warehouse stocks has
continued relentlessly, and is likely to dampen any bullish sentiment.
Copper stocks are up a total of 7,425 tonnes this week to 362,125 tonnes,
the highest level for nine years. Cash copper shows a fall of Pounds 31 to
Pounds 1,411 a tonne. But the important three-month dollar figure has been
stuck below overhead resistance at Dollars 2,170 a tonne.
The week's rise in aluminium stocks totals 11,025 tonnes, giving a fresh
record of 1,736,325 tonnes. The gloomy fundamentals in this market took the
three-month price below Dollars 1,150 a tonne on Tuesday to 14 1/2 -month
lows, and it ended the week at Dollars 1,147.25, down Dollars 16.25 on the
week.
Zinc stocks rose above 600,000 tonnes yesterday to a new record. Three-month
metal, which dipped below important psychological support at Dollars 1,000 a
tonne on Thursday, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,006.5, down Dollars 4.75 on
the week. If it falls below the contract low of Dollars 987 a tonne, some
analysts believe it will rapidly retreat to Dollars 950. Stocks are likely
to increase further, and recent production cuts have been nowhere near
enough to boost prices.
Production cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have
failed to meet their target of 23.58m barrels a day by 700,000 b/d,
estimates showed on Thursday. However, the figures were good enough to lift
Brent crude prices out of their recent narrow range and above Dollars 19 on
London's International Petroleum Exchange.
In late trading yesterday the Brent June contract was holding above Dollars
19, although the opening of Nymex knocked the market back.
The big news in the softs market this week was the collapse on Wednesday of
talks on renewing the international coffee pact with economic clauses. The
news arrived just after the London robusta market had closed, but in New
York arabica prices closed around 2 cents a lb higher.
On Thursday morning the London market moved sharply ahead on short-covering
on the back of the New York close, but was unable to sustain the rally.
Consumer stocks are high, and the peak roasting season has finished.
The July contract closed yesterday at Dollars 839 a tonne, down Dollars 17
on the week and Dollars 26 since the start of the talks a fortnight ago.
The markets have not expected the International Coffee Organisation
negotiations over the past 12 months to produce anything positive. But
nonetheless, each time an ICO meeting has ended in deadlock prices have been
adversely affected.
'The talks have been a deterrrent to trading,' said one London dealer,
welcoming the collapse. 'A cloud of uncertainty has lifted.'

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Warnford agrees to amend accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNFORD INVESTMENTS, the property investment group, has agreed to amend the
treatment of properties in its accounts following discussions with the
Financial Reporting Review Panel, the watchdog of accounting standards.
The company had not complied with SSAP 19, the accounting standard which
requires investment properties to be shown at open market value, in its
accounts for 1991.
This shows that the Review Panel is determined to take action against
companies even when any divergence from accounting standards is clearly
flagged in the accounts.
Warnford had highlighted that its company balance sheet did not comply with
SSAP 19 in its fixed assets note in the accounts. The fact was also noted in
the auditor's report.
But Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the Review Panel, said: 'It is not
enough just to have a qualified audit report or to disclose in the notes.
You have to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act.'
Mr Frank Martyn, finance director of Warnford, said the company had not
complied with SSAP 19 because to do so would have disclosed the open market
value of a property which the company was in negotiations to sell.
He said because the company only held one freehold property, its value would
have been clearly identifiable if it had complied with SSAP 19. But he
stressed that it was shown at market value in the consolidated group
accounts, so non-compliance had no effect on the group's value or earnings.
'It made no difference whatsoever to the market's perception of the
company.'
Mr Treadgold said: 'Reasons of commercial confidentiality can never really
be justification for departing from accounting standards.'
Warnford's directors have agreed to follow SSAP 19 in the future. But they
have managed to escape revealing the value of the property by re-allocating
it to a subsidiary. Mr Martyn said the property had still not been sold.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Storm directors depart over dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM GROUP, the USM-quoted animation, licensing and merchandising company,
lost its chief executive and a US-based executive vice president yesterday
after a boardroom disagreement over the future direction of the company.
Mr James Driscoll, chairman, founder and creator of The Shoe People, one of
Storm's childrens' cartoons, said they had disagreed with the decision to
refocus the group on its core royalty-driven licensing, merchandising and
publications activit-ies.
Although Storm will continue to develop animation ideas and undertake
commissioned cartoon productions, Mr Driscoll said it would no longer use
its own funds to make animated cartoons.
He said Mr Gary Smith, chief executive, and Mr Brian Larcher, executive vice
president of the US subsidiary, disagreed and resigned amicably. Last year
Storm spent between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 1.7m on productions.
Meanwhile Mr Jerry Alpert, another US-based executive vice president of the
group, has been appointed to the board. Mr Alpert has been responsible for
building up the group's worldwide network of agents and developing its US
licensing business.
Mr Driscoll said yesterday that the group would announce two more large
worldwide licensing deals with 'major US properties' in the next two weeks.
Last year Storm was appointed Paramount Pictures' exclusive licensing and
merchandising representative in Britain. Paramount's properties include Star
Trek, Cheers and the Addams Family.

Gaskell, the carpet group, is reducing its dividend from 8.5p to 4.25p for
1992, with a final of 2.75p, although it is not fully covered.
The directors had reason to believe that 'we have have pased the low point
in our recent company fortunes'.
In the year turnover fell from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 28.3m and pre-tax
profit dropped from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 131,000. Earnings per share
worked through to 1.6p (3.1p).
Nearly all the decline in sales was in carpet tiles made by Bamber Carpets.
The two principal subsidiaries recorded a small increase.

Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based oil and gas company with a London quote,
announced increased net losses of Dollars 9.83m (Pounds 6.92m) for the year
to December 31. In 1991 there were losses of Dollars 8.81m.
The company said the figures reflected a change in accounting for oil and
gas assets from the 'successful efforts' to the 'full cost' method for
better comparability with similar sized oil and gas companies.
Sales improved to Dollars 10.4m (Dollars 9.32m) primarily as a result of
production from the Colombia fields. Losses per share were 119 cents (169
cents).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Associated Fisheries rose 17p to 144p yesterday after the company
reported a turnround from a loss of Pounds 4.48m to a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 3.16m in 1992, after restatement to comply with FRS 3.
The effect of the restatement is to charge against pre-tax profit a
provision of Pounds 5.5m that was originally treated as extraordinary.
The 1992 profit was boosted by Pounds 500,000 write back of an over
provision in the previous year for the loss on disposal of the Macfish
investment.
Earnings per share were 19.19p (losses 31.67p). The final dividend is 7p for
a total of 8p (7p). Turnover came to Pounds 84.6m (Pounds 83.6m) and
operating profit to Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 1.84m).

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Besieged C&amp;J Clark tumbles to Pounds 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERE pressure on margins and a decline in UK demand helped to cut 1992-93
profits at C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe manufacturer at the centre of a
controversial bid approach from Berisford.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-January collapsed from Pounds 20.4m
to Pounds 1.7m, after charging Pounds 12.5m for a rationalisation of the
group's manufacturing and retail businesses.
Some 1,000 of the group's total 18,400 jobs were lost last year as Clark
sought to improve its international competitiveness under a three-year plan
launched in 1992. Mr Alan Mackay, finance director, said the major part of
the costs of this programme had now been taken.
Sales were 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 624.6m. Mr Mackay said the group had
made progress on promoting Clark as an international brand. 'The real
achievement this year has been, that in the midst of all our difficulties,
we have given the business a new focus.' The Clark board and its
shareholders have been split over the bid from Berisford, recommended by a
majority of the board last month. The board has called an EGM for May 7 to
discuss the proposals.
Prospects for the current year were looking better, Mr Mackay said. The rise
in occupancy costs, which had hit Clark severely in recent years, was easing
off, while sales in March had been some 10 per cent ahead of last year.
Net debt was cut from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 37.9m, for gearing of 17.7 per
cent. On the basis of this outlook, an uncovered dividend of 3.75p (7.5p) is
being paid, including a final to take advantage of Budget proposals of 2p
(4p). Earnings fell 17.2p to 0.6p.
Clark has been under pressure from many shareholders since it cut the
dividend from 9.4p to 7.5p in 1992. Many of the 500 family members who
control the company rely on the dividend as their main source of income.
Although the report described the annual results as 'a major
disappointment', Mr Mackay said the return from the footwear division had
been slightly better than expected.
Volumes had been maintained, in a market which saw UK consumers buying at
least one less pair than four years ago. Profits from footwear in the UK and
Europe were 42 cent down at Pounds 14.7m. In Australia and North America
profits were up 29 per cent at Pounds 4m.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat bosses suspended - Hotel group
takes swift action over its financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, ROBERT PESTON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL crisis at Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, claimed its
first senior management victims yesterday when Mr Martin Marcus, deputy
chairman, and Mr David Hersey, finance director, were suspended from their
duties with immediate effect.
It also emerged that Barclays, Queen Moat's joint lead bank, had sent a
letter to the group's 44 other banks asking them not to call in loans,
pending the results of an investigation of the company's affairs by
investigators from Grant Thornton, the accountants.
Grant Thornton is probing why the group ran into financial difficulties,
when only a week ago it gave no inkling to bankers of its problems.
Bankers said yesterday that part of the reason for the apparent collapse in
Queens Moat's profits may have been that in past years the company booked
profits on the expectation of future cash flows, which in the event have not
materialised.
The company said yesterday that the announcement of the group's full-year
results, scheduled for next Wednesday, had been postponed.
The suspension of Mr Marcus and Mr Hersey was the result of bank pressure.
One banker said last night: 'It's very important that responsibility is
clearly seen to be taken. We're talking about a financial problem and the
people responsible for that have to take responsibility.'
The sudden and unexpected crisis at Queens Moat was the result of Mr John
Bairstow, the chairman, taking more direct control of the company. Mr
Bairstow, who is 62, had decided to reduce his role when he turned 60. He
increasingly felt, however, that the group did not have a suitable successor
in place and that he should play a more active part.
Mr Marcus sold Pounds 629,500 of Queens Moat shares, about half his holding,
in February, on the last working day before the start of the group's close
season. He said he had sold the shares to fulfil personal commitments.
Queens Moat said yesterday that cheques had been posted in respect of
interest payable on April 1 on the 10 1/4 per cent First Mortgage Debenture
Stock 2020.
Hotel industry rivals said yesterday that while Queens Moat was highly
regarded for its hotel operating skills, it had been clear for some time
that its financial expertise had not kept pace with its growth.
'They over-stretched themselves and grew too quickly. They were running all
over the continent and the UK like blue-arsed flies,' a senior hotel
executive said.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr Maurice Hart became non-executive chairman of
the audit committee of Queens Moat within 14 months of resigning as senior
partner of Bird Luckin, the firm which audits the consolidated accounts.
This rapid change of jobs does not appear to breach any current professional
ethical rules, although draft rules being considered by the chartered
accountancy profession might introduce an intervening 'quarantine' period.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays appointment 'should not be rushed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of a new chief executive from outside Barclays 'should not
be rushed,' Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman said yesterday. The bank's
current management structure was 'only just settling down'.
Mr Buxton's remarks in the bank's annual report come after the announcement
that he intended to bring in a chief executive to take over part of his
responsibilities.
Mr Buxton became chairman and chief executive in January but decided to
split the roles amid public pressure from institutional investors. Criticism
was increased by the fact that it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m last
year.
He said the board was satisfied that there were 'already sufficient checks
and balances on my powers as both chairman and chief executive,' but that
steps would be taken to split the two roles during 1993.
Mr Buxton also criticised public and political attitudes towards banks in
Britain, saying a healthy banking system was a pre-requisite for a healthy
business environment.
'This economic reality is understood in the United States, where the
regulators have encouraged the improvement of profit levels within the
banking industry, but unfortunately it does not always seem to be
appreciated in the UK,' he said.
The accounts disclosed that the highest paid director last year received
Pounds 524,000. The salary of Sir John Quinton, the former chairman who
stepped down as chief executive last May, fell from Pounds 382,000 to Pounds
265,000.
Bonuses totalling Pounds 400,500 were paid to Mr David Band, chief executive
of Barclays' BZW investment bank, and Lord Camoys, BZW deputy chairman, 'to
ensure that their overall remuneration remained competitive'.
The bonuses were also said to reflect the 'improved performance' of the
division. BZW's pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 241m in 1992, from Pounds 214m
in 1991.
Total emoluments paid to directors fell to Pounds 2.88m, from Pounds 3.02m
in 1991 when the bank made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 533m.

Ulster Television, the indep-endent programme contractor, lifted pre-tax

The dividend is stepped up from 7.5p to 10p with a final of 5.75p. Earnings
per share increased to 24.2p (11.26p).
The profit was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.79m (Pounds

Interest income dropped from Pounds 908,000 to Pounds 457,000, the result of
the progressive drop in interest rates and the investment of Pounds 2.6m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 32.6m). A breakdown of operating
profits showed distribution of building materials Pounds 352,000 (Pounds

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles deal close to agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS involved in the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, parent of the
troubled Gateway food retail chain, are now confident that the deal is close
to being agreed.
The company is due to approve the arrangements at a board meeting early next
week which will be followed by a formal presentation to the 38 banks
involved. Agreement in principle is expected shortly after Easter subject to
documentation.
Isosceles, formed in 1989 through a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out, has a
standstill agreement with its banks until May 28 but was keen to sign the
refinancing well before then to reassure its trade creditors.
The deal involves Gateway assuming Pounds 500m of debt, which it should be
able to service from trading, and Isosceles having about Pounds 140m of
debt. Lenders will also receive deep discounted bonds, preference shares and
ordinary shares for their loans. The mezzanine holders are understood to
have agreed the terms which will mean heavy losses for them.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Invesco shuffles board as profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management group, is to combine the roles of
chairman and chief executive into a single role, that of executive chairman.
That post will be filled by the current chief executive Mr Charles Brady.
The move is part of a wide-ranging reorganisation of the group's board
structure following a series of well publicised and highly embarrassing
business dealings under Invesco's former chairman and chief executive, Lord
Stevens.
Invesco will establish separate boards for each of its businesses in North
America, Europe and Asia and the group board will be restructured to include
a majority of non-executive directors. 'We hope to avoid what went on in the
past,' Mr Brady said in explaining why he had sought the new structure.
'There is a different regulatory culture in each of the three regions and we
must be sensitive to each.'
Mr Brady will be the only executive to sit on all three regional boards as
well as on the main board. He said that although the best practice in
corporate governance discourages combining the roles of chairman and chief
executive, he believed that the new board structure would ensure that
authority was not concentrated in a single individual.
Mr Brady also said the US Attorney's Office in Atlanta had dropped its
investigation into allegations that officials in the group's US division had
made gifts to officials at one of its big pension fund clients, the utility
company Southern Corporation. Mr Brady said Invesco had been asked to answer
questions last autumn by the US Attorney about the matter and that it had
since been told that the US Attorney was satisfied.
Yesterday, Invesco also unveiled its 1992 results, showing pre-tax profits
after exceptional items down from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 12.6m. The dividend
for the year is being halved to 3p via a final of 2p. The results included a
Pounds 410,000 charge stemming from the write-off of systems and development
costs related to the Stock Exchange's decision to cancel its Taurus
paperless trading system. The company also took a further Pounds 2.8m charge
stemming from costs related to a feasibility study it conducted last year
into a flotation of the US businesses.
The company's results show that revenues from Invesco's US operations dwarf
those from Europe, where the company is losing institutional clients, and
Asia.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Provisions take toll as Evered Bardon
attempts to consolidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERED BARDON cut its divi-dend yesterday and announced a Pounds 57.6m
provision arising from expansion in the eighties which has left the building
materials group heavily geared.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 fell from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 18.2m, but these
were wiped out by the exceptional item, which covered losses on disposals,
investments and property. The exceptional included Pounds 30.3m of goodwill
which had previously been written off.
Under FRS 3, the new accounting standard, the group would have made a
pre-tax loss Pounds 40.3m and losses per share of 13p. By sticking with the
old convention, the group reported earnings per share of 2.9p (5.1p), but
cut its final dividend to 1.2p (3.66p), giving a total of 2p (5.595p).
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said: 'The extraordinary provisions made are
a necessary part of the process of consolidation after the rapid expansion
of earlier years.'
In spite of making disposals worth Pounds 34m during the year, exchange rate
movements added Pounds 64m to group debt, which is all dollar-denominated.
Net debt rose from Pounds 261m to Pounds 307m, and gearing increased from 70
to 90 per cent. Since the year-end, the group has raised Pounds 24m by
selling a half-share of part of its US operations, but gearing remains in
the mid-80s.
The company's extraordinary provision will cover the planned disposal of its
UK concrete businesses and a quarry operation in North Carolina, but these
will have a negligible effect on gearing. Mr Tom said he was considering a
range of options to improve the finances - including further disposals,
joint ventures or some sort of refinancing.
Sales were flat at Pounds 336m (Pounds 334m) but operating profits fell from
Pounds 45m to Pounds 32.7m.
COMMENT
Evered Bardon faces a long and rocky road for the forseeable future, with no
obvious way round its debt mountain. Further disposals are likely to dilute
earnings, and a rights issue is not a realistic option given the depressed
share price, unchanged yesterday at 37p. The trading performance was in line
with expectations, but analysts were surprised by the size of the
provisions. There was an element of kitchen-sinking by the new finance
director, who is confident that the group will be at worst cash neutral next
year. Offering European competitors access to the UK through a joint venture
might be one way of bolstering the balance sheet. Forecast earnings of
Pounds 15m put the shares on a multiple of 18.5 - high enough until the way
ahead becomes clearer.

FT  03 APR 93 / The news isn't all bad: New faces at the top of ITN indicate
that the news service is emerging from a difficult period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Independent Television News were a manufacturer of dustbins, bicycles or
tomato ketchup rather than an award-winning British news organisation, there
is little doubt that the receivers would have been summoned two years ago.
Its costs were clearly out of control. Some industry observers even talked
of a 'black hole' in the accounts as losses mounted. There were unfortunate
diversifications into computers and property. And ITN's shareholders found
it almost impossible to agree on what action to take to arrest the slide.
Although the survival of the company was not in doubt, and the quality of
its journalism did not suffer, the company was forced into a difficult and
often painful restructuring from which it only now appears to be emerging.
On Monday, ITN's flagship programme, News At Ten, will be able to report:
The formal appointment of a new ITN chief executive, Mr David Gordon, chief
executive of The Economist magazine;
The completion of an ownership restructuring and the arrival of new
shareholders including Reuters and Carlton Communications, which took over
the London weekday franchise from Thames Television; The completion of a
news-supply contract with Channel 4, which adds to the five-year Pounds 268m
deal signed in December with ITV;
An outline of ITN's strategy as a profit-making business. Until recently,
ITN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ITV network, has provided a news
service without being expected to make a profit.
ITN's transition is best symbolised by the changing faces at the top of the
organisation. Sir David Nicholas, the supreme television journalist, handed
over his chief executive's role in 1991 to Mr Bob Phillis, who began the
process of cutting costs and making ITN more commercial. This task will now
be taken forward by Mr Gordon, who is both a former journalist and a
businessman. When he arrived at ITN, Mr Phillis - the new deputy
director-general of the BBC - inherited a Pounds 10m overspend. During his
two-year tenure he was forced to cut staff from 1,100 to 650.
'Bob Phillis has done an effective job in stabilising ITN and reducing
costs,' says Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television and
an existing director of ITN who will also be a board member of the
restructured company.
The pressure for change was a direct result of the 1990 Broadcasting Act,
which required ITN to sell off 51 per cent of its shares to non-broadcasters
by the end of next year. The franchise round, when ITV licences were put out
to competitive tender in 1991, increased instability when three ITN
shareholders - Thames, TVS and Television - lost their franchises.
When their successors - Carlton, Meridian and Westcountry - took over, they
found that losses on the lease of ITN's London headquarters were running at
the rate of about Pounds 5m a year. The ITV companies had hoped to make a
profit by letting out unused floors in the Gray's Inn Road building.
Instead, with the collapse in the commercial property market, most remained
empty.
In response to this potential crisis, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton
Communications who takes over as chairman of ITN, put together a four-member
consortium to take over the group - Carlton, Central, London Weekend
Television and Reuters. They were later joined by Granada, Anglia and
Scottish Television. Members of the consortium hope that the restructuring,
with the possible addition of a US network as a minority shareholder, will
be enough to make the government waive the 51 per cent requirement. The
consortium not only made a commitment of Pounds 30m to fund ITN but also
organised a Pounds 74m buy-out of the building.
But can ITN be turned into a wholly commercial business without compromising
editorial standards?
'Absolutely,' says Mr Gordon who is interested in exploiting international
opportunities. 'The exact form that this will take and with which partners,
is something that will be preoccupying me over the next few months,' he
adds. A link with a US network is possible.
The move to profit has already started. In the 17 months to the end of 1992
it is believed ITN made an operational profit of between Pounds 7m and
Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 3m for the 12 months of 1991.
The improvement is expected to continue. In addition to the ITV and the
Channel 4 contracts, Mr Gordon is keen to expand ITN's video sales operation
and its programming activities, which include making news documentaries for
ITV. He also believes that rapidly changing technology should allow further
savings. 'ITN has further to go along the Bob Phillis road of reducing costs
and increasing efficiency,' says Mr Gordon.
'The whole point is to be able to put the money on the screen and hire
first-rate reporters and editors to convert pictures into programmes.'
The evidence so far is that cost-cutting has not reduced the quality of
ITN's news operation - although the November revamp of News at Ten -
featuring a brash blue set, heavy use of graphics and Trevor MacDonald as
the single anchorman - has led to accusations of a plunge down market.
ITN's editor-in-chief, Mr Stewart Purvis, produces counter-evidence. The
demographic profile of the viewership, he points out, has held steady. In
November 1990, 41 per cent of the News at Ten audience came from
professional and managerial groups; the percentage last February remained at
41 per cent.
News at Ten's share of the main evening audience during 1992 averaged just
under 52 per cent, and climbed to 53 per cent in the first quarter of 1993,
a nightly average of 7.1m viewers. Channel Four news has averaged more than
1m over the same period.
In terms of quality, an ITN reporter last week picked up the news
organisation's 10th British Academy award since 1980 for her coverage of
Serbian prison camps.
As Mr Purvis put it recently: 'Yes, we've cut costs; yes, we want more
people to watch our programmes; but, no, we haven't cut the quality of our
coverage.'
And finally . . . Mr Hill of Central has a clear idea of what he wants from
ITN. Apart from a return on his investment, he says: 'I favour trying to use
ITN's strength to be news supplier to the world.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Supremely mysterious: Robert Thomson explains the obscure
workings of Japan's highest court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Without fuss, and with a fanfare of small and obscurely placed newspaper
reports to greet him, Mr Masao Ono has just become one of Japan's most
influential individuals. Appointed this week to the Japanese supreme court,
he shares the ultimate right to define what his fellow citizens can read or
watch, and has the power to determine when life ends.
Supreme Court appointments in the US, which must be approved by Congress,
may provoke months of public debate and raise fears about a shift to the
left or a veer to the right. In Japan, the highest court in the land prefers
private appointments of largely anonymous, if experienced, practitioners,
who are expected to maintain a low public profile after their promotion.
There are 15 justices on Japan's supreme court, which has the power to
interpret the constitution and is the final court of appeal. The judges'
chambers have one of the best views in Tokyo, overlooking rows of cherry
blossoms in spring and the deep moat around the Imperial Palace. In theory,
the palace's tenant, Emperor Akihito, appoints the judges, but his approval
comes after a selection is made by the legal bureaucracy, which is a law
unto itself.
'Appointments are a bit of a mystery. It's difficult to say who is actually
responsible,' explained Mr Eiki Endo, vice-president of the Second Tokyo Bar
Association, which proposed the newly-appointed Mr Ono, a 65-year-old lawyer
who replaced another former lawyer who retired compulsorily at 70.
There is no rule demanding that there be four lawyers among the 15, or six
career judges, two ex-bureaucrats, two prosecutors and one law professor;
but there is a tradition of maintaining those ratios and tradition weighs
very heavily on the court.
The traditions are observed faithfully by the Cabinet, which plays a nominal
role in approving selections already made by the court.
But recent controversial judgments have prompted debate on whether the
supreme court is attempting to petrify an image of Japan far from the modern
reality. Reformist lawyers complain that the judges are embarrassed by their
constitutional power and retreat into ambiguity because they are too scared
to establish a clear precedent or to challenge the government's authority.
The court's sometimes strange ways were highlighted recently by a
31-year-old dispute about the power of the ministry of education to censor
textbooks.
Most cases are decided on written evidence submitted, without calling
witnesses. And so it was for Professor Saburo Ienaga, whose book, A New
Japanese History, was rejected as a school text by the ministry in 1962 for
a blunt account of Japanese military aggression in Asia during the second
world war.
Prof Ienaga, now 79, had climbed through the court hierarchy, winning
compensation in one case, only to lose it again on appeal. But when the
supreme court finally delivered judgment, after seven years, neither the
professor nor his representatives were present. Unannounced, the judges had
filed into an empty courtroom, delivered the verdict to the court recorders,
and filed out again.
'They didn't even tell me it was going to happen,' the distraught professor
complained on the day, drawing much public sympathy. The court ruled that
the ministry is entitled to alter any textbook as long as its concerns are
'reasonable', giving the bureaucracy broad powers, which the ministry later
said would be used 'appropriately'.
Appropriate use of wide bureaucratic powers has been a characteristic of
Japan's post-war economic success, and has its origins in the Confucian
ideas of hierarchy and harmony, influential since the sixth century. One
reason for not appointing a brilliant, idiosyncratic lawyer is that he or
she might disrupt the harmony of the bench.
In assessing Mr Ienaga's complaint about changes to his text, which dared to
describe the Japanese army as 'reckless', the court considered his
constitutional right to be published. But it found this right was outweighed
by the need to preserve the government's right to intervene to maintain a
collective harmony - a concept not defined in the constitution.
The direction of the Japanese court bemuses US jurists because the
constitution was rewritten after the second world war by US specialists with
their own Supreme Court in mind.
Under Articles 76 and 77, the judiciary was clearly separated from the
government and the judges were to be 'independent in the exercise of their
conscience', a quality more evident in the 1950s than the 1990s.
Mr Seiichi Yoshikawa, an attorney who has studied the two supreme courts,
said the Japanese version was dynamic in the years immediately after the
war. Since then the court has gradually become less questioning. Most
verdicts are unanimous and the rights of the bureaucracy are repeatedly
asserted: 'In the US, you have a sense that the courts are resolving the
great economic and social issues of the day - you can't feel that here.'
But public opinion has been stirred by the ordeals suffered by Prof Ienaga
and by the realisation that the country now has a justice minister in favour
of hanging, Masaharu Gotoda, who signed orders for the execution of three
prisoners last week - the first executions since 1989. In a previous
decision on the death penalty, the supreme court ruled that hanging is
constitutional as long as it is not 'cruel'.

FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Not so certain an impact on competitive tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN H HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You concluded ('Court blow to contracting-out', March 25) that the
recent decision that the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations apply to the
contracting-out of prison education services is likely to have a major
impact on the rest of the government's market testing and competitive
tendering programme.
Of course every case can be distinguished on its particular facts, but the
nature of the transfer from the Home Office prison education service to
South Manchester College, two separate parts of the public sector, is very
much within the scope of the transfer regulations even within the terms of
the government's guidance.
It is easy to read too much from the European Court judgment in Rask, which
you cite. This turned on the specific facts that the incoming contractor had
bound himself to employ the same staff on the same terms and conditions,
thus effectively making the regulations apply. It by no means implies that
all cases of contracting out will be similarly decided; indeed, I would be
surprised if this transpires.
Our member companies are continuing to defend cases brought under the
regulations. In general, UK industrial tribunals are continuing to rule that
in simple contracting-out cases, where there is no agreement to transfer
staff, premises or equipment, and where the contractor reorganises the
service, Tupe does not apply.

FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: No fooling with this increased charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How appropriate that your leader, 'Local councils', appeared on April
Fool's Day.
The London borough of Haringey informed me the previous day that my council
tax bill for 1993-94 is Pounds 1048.05. In 1992-93 the community charge for
my wife and myself, the only residents at the address below, totalled Pounds
767.84. The increase is Pounds 270.21 - which is considerably more than the
maximum weekly figure Pounds 3.50 given by your writer.
Neither my wife nor I would grudge paying more in order to improve the
educational and library services as well as seeing that there is, for a
change, adequate resources made available for care in the community.

FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Complexities that endanger financial regulatory
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER WILLMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re 'Study of finance regulators urged' (March 26), Taurus toppled
because, among other things, of the weight of sheer complexity; now the
financial regulatory organisations are in danger of suffering the same fate.
The organisations were established with the ultimate and simple objective of
protecting clients. In the wake of recent scandals, their role of protection
is expanding into the diverse requirements of compliance. This has resulted
in their proactive role in management functions.
The rationale for regulation is clear, but the process is having a
debilitating effect on the management of financial companies. The worry is
that the regulatory structure will collapse under the complexity of
compliance, leaving not only a regulatory vacuum but also an industry that
has lost its competitive edge.

FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Tecs are attracting skilled women back to workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JOANNA FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I correct an impression in your article 'EOC says women overlooked
by Tecs' (March 31), which implied that training and enterprise councils had
made no impression on women's training opportunities. The EOC report
actually draws particular attention to the success of a number of Tecs,
notably Tyneside, Birmingham, North West Wales and Hertfordshire, in
attracting skilled women back into the workforce. This is the kind of
programme that we would like to see all Tecs taking up.
What unfortunately is still continuous is the stereotyping of occupations
and, in consequence, of training opportunities, which holds women back from
taking up careers in areas non-traditional for their sex. It is in this
context that the phrase 'not one jot of difference' was reported.
Segregation of jobs by sex is deep-rooted and to counteract it will take a
great deal of political will and effort. This is why our report calls for a
strong initiative from government to encourage Tecs to translate their very
good policies into innovative practices.

FT  03 APR 93 / No such thing as a free flight: Guy de Jonquieres and
Michael Skapinker examine what lessons the flawed Hoover offer holds for
other consumer businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoover's free flights fiasco, which culminated this week in the dismissal of
three top managers and a Dollars 30m provision by Maytag, its US parent, may
have turned the company into a national laughing-stock. But for many other
consumer businesses, the affair has struck too sensitive a nerve to allow
much gloating.
Though Hoover's programme was deeply flawed, it is a stark reminder that all
sales incentive schemes involve risks - and that when things go wrong, the
consequences can be as severe for companies as for their customers. 'My
attitude is one of sympathy,' said one travel industry executive. 'There but
for the grace of God go all of us.'
Tempting buyers with promises of something for nothing is one of marketing's
oldest wheezes. Recently, recession and keener competition have brought many
new players into the game and provided a bonanza for consultants in
'value-added' or promotional marketing.
'There are loads of different rewards on offer - from free holidays to
compact discs and video-recorders,' says Ms Sue Short of the Institute of
Sales Promotion, an industry body. 'Many retailers launched programmes after
they saw Hoover's success in generating sales.'
Long popular with the tabloid press, 'value-added' promotions have spread to
quality newspapers, including the FT, with its promotions of 'Lunch for a
Fiver' and two business class air tickets for the price of one. Supermarkets
including J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway have all recently offered
incentives such as cheap air tickets and holidays and free computers for
schools.
About 140 groups have contracts with Air Miles, a company set up in late
1988, which give their customers credits towards the cost of air tickets. An
estimated 15 per cent of British households now collect Air Miles.
Foreign travel incentives are particularly popular, partly because excess
capacity in the travel industry makes them cheap to offer. Many airlines and
tour operators provide discounts for 'value-added' promotions free of charge
in exchange for the advertising they generate  - and also because they stand
to make profits by selling extras such as car rental.
Most such schemes have run smoothly, because experience has taught their
sponsors to take precautions against pitfalls. What distinguishes the Hoover
case is that the company seemed oblivious to the dangers. Indeed, in the
view of many marketing experts, it made almost every mistake in the book.
The key to 'value-added' schemes lies in calculating how many consumers will
take advantage of them. 'It is essential to know the full extent of your
exposure in advance,' says Mr Terry Leahy, marketing director of Tesco,
which rewards customers spending more than Pounds 25 at its stores by
contributing towards the cost of computers in their children's schools.
Many companies use sophisticated computer models to forecast the likely
take-up rate by eligible applicants. For travel-related schemes this
averages 10 per cent or less. If the rate risks being much higher, most
companies will insure against losses. Dixons, the electrical retailer, says
it will only run promotional schemes if it is sure they will be profitable.
Hoover neither did its sums properly nor, it says, did it take out
insurance. The company's most serious error was to generate an uneconomic
take-up rate by offering too good a bargain: the chance to acquire air
tickets worth as much as Pounds 400 by buying an appliance for only Pounds
119. Many consumers bought Hoover products simply to qualify for free
flights.
No other company in recent times has made such a generous offer. But then
most say their promotions, unlike Hoover's, are not designed to induce
consumers to make purchases they had no intention of making; rather, the aim
is to persuade those who are already in the market to choose one brand over
others.
Mr Tony Bennett, marketing director of travel agents Thomas Cook, which
recently ran a promotion with the consumer electronics company Sony, says:
'You don't get people going into Currys or Dixons saying they want a Sony
television; they say they want a television. All we want to do is influence
them at the point of sale to buy a Sony television.'
Outright free gifts, unless of trivial value, are also a rarity. Most
promotions require a further investment by consumers in order to take
advantage of an incentive. The most popular method is to offer discounts on
the total cost of purchases such as holidays, restaurant meals or air
tickets.
Some schemes are also designed to reward customer loyalty. Safeway recently
offered discounts of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on Thomson
holidays, depending on how much customers spent on groceries over a
three-month period.
Hoover's problems were compounded by confusion about the conditions of its
promotion. This had already been amended at the insistence of the
Advertising Standards Authority, the industry watchdog, which objected that
it did not make clear that the free flights were limited to certain dates
and destinations. Yet thousands of consumers still claimed to have been
misled.
'Hoover were not bold enough about the restrictions on their programme. By
the time people came up against them, they were emotionally committed to
taking the flights,' says one travel manager. Worse still, many customers
who had complied with the conditions were kept waiting for flights by the
travel agents administering the scheme.
According to Mr Steve Dowdle, marketing director of the UK subsidiary of
Sony, avoiding customer complaints is the first rule of 'value-added'
promotions. 'We have turned down schemes which looked marvellous on paper
because the conditions were too complex,' he says. Sony also sets up a
telephone helpline for every special offer. 'If more than 1 per cent of
eligible customers complain, a promotion has not worked,' says Mr Dowdle.
Companies such as Sony, Sainsbury and Tesco are acutely aware that whenever
they launch a promotion, they put on the line their single most precious
asset - their brand. For them, a short-term sales boost is valueless if it
is achieved at the expense of customers' long-term confidence in them as
reputable suppliers.
But do special promotions really yield tangible benefits - or are they
simply necessary to match the competition? Tesco says market research shows
well-run schemes enhance customer loyalty. Mr Don Gray, marketing director
of Express Newspapers, says they can raise circulation by up to 5 per cent -
though he is unsure how much of such gains is permanent.
The FT says promotions help it both to forge a closer relationship with
readers and to build up information about them which is useful in selling
advertising.
Mr Dowdle of Sony is more sceptical, saying his company engages in special
offers mainly to satisfy retailers. 'I would love to do no promotions at
all, because I'd like to feel that people choose Sony because of its
products, not for the incentives,' he says.
Mr David Pugh, marketing manager of the Telegraph group, fears the Hoover
fiasco has devalued even reputable promotions. 'The next time we run a
special offer, questions will inevitably arise in readers' minds,' he says.
'We will have to go out of our way to distance ourselves from Hoover-type
schemes.'
Given that consumers' right to legal redress over poorly handled promotions
is often unclear, such prudence is probably their best guarantee against
future fiascos. But that is small consolation to Hoover as it struggles to
repair damage to its reputation which threatens to linger on long after the
financial costs of the affair have been settled.

FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: A recipe for more stable small business financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEON H LIEBMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Bankers and small business' (March 1) reported the
view of Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, that 'the system
of financing small business should be fundamentally rethought'. I agree.
However, his prescription is flawed.
Neither tax breaks nor interest subsidies would have prevented the small
business lending disaster which UK banks experienced. Preventing its
recurrence rests in part with banks adopting three policies leading to more
conservative small company management.
First, all long-term lending should be as term loans with fixed amortisation
schedules providing for full repayment of the sum borrowed. This will reduce
the likelihood that the bank will find itself providing permanent capital in
the form of short-term debt.
Second, all overdrafts should require that the borrower not use the
overdraft for 90 consecutive days in each business year. This will help
guarantee that overdrafts are for seasonal purposes or infrequent
occurrences only.
Third, businesses should be required to increase their principal repayments
pound for pound with owners' increases in their personal compensation. This
will speed debt repayment, reduce balance sheet leverage and guarantee
earnings retention.
Without any other actions by banks these three steps will lead to stronger
smaller company balance sheets and will mandate more conservative company
management. That is what is required to survive a severe recession - not
government subsidies to banks.
British banks have a special advantage. Their first fixed and floating
charge stands ahead of all other claims. The result is they 'enjoy' the
benefit of a shift of liabilities to the Treasury when struggling companies
do not pay tax liabilities in response to banks' pressures to reduce loans
outstanding. That is subsidy enough.

FT  03 APR 93 / Man in the News: The seeds of a political storm - Raymond
Plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Plant of Highfield, professor of Politics at Southampton University, is
an unlikely harbinger of political revolution.
Politics professors are traditionally long on academic theory and short in
their impact on the grubby world of realpolitik. Yet the soft-spoken,
self-effacing Raymond Plant appears to have launched an upheaval that could
alter the UK political landscape irreversibly.
For he is the chairman of the Labour party inquiry on electoral reform,
which will publish its report later this month. It will recommend that the
first-past-the-post system used to elect MPs should be replaced by a form of
proportional representation.
If the report is adopted by the Labour party, Her Majesty's opposition could
enter the next election campaign committed to constitutional change that
would alter the face of British government.
And if Lord Plant's report is rejected by Labour, the storm which would
follow could wreck the party's chances of re-election. For electoral reform
is an issue which divides Labour as fundamentally as its relationship with
the unions.
This week, the opening shots were fired in a new round of the party's
internal strife when the committee met to finalise its recommendations. Lord
Plant resisted pleas to produce a report setting out a menu of options for
the party to choose from. Instead, he was determined to make firm
recommendations, the mandate he had been given when the inquiry was launched
in late 1990 by Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour leader.
The suggestion that Plant should chair the committee came originally from Mr
Roy Hattersley, then Labour's deputy leader and a staunch opponent of PR.
Hattersley had found discussions with Plant helpful in writing his political
testament, Choose Freedom.
Lord Plant is one of Britain's leading political philosophers, with
well-regarded books on Hegel, community politics and modern political theory
to his name. His unique selling proposition as chairman, however, was that
he had given no great thought to electoral reform before and could thus be
presented as having an open mind.
Mr Kinnock's strategy in setting up the Plant committee was to bury a
contentious issue in a slow-moving inquiry. Although it has since emerged
that Kinnock favoured PR, endorsing it before the general election might
have looked like a tacit admission that Labour could not win on its own. The
inquiry would take two years, so that its work would be completed only after
the election was won. If it came out in favour, the case could then be
argued from a position of strength.
The strategy seemed to work well at first. A carefully chosen committee of
MPs, trade unionists, academics and party worthies was selected to work with
Lord Plant.
In summer 1991, the committee published a well-received interim report,
examining all the options, their advantages and disadvantages. This method
of working is typical of Lord Plant. His forte is in analysing complex
arguments, filleting out points for and against a particular position and
then presenting a few simple options for the listener to choose between.
He is also unusual among politically committed thinkers in his willingness
to engage with contrary points of view. Lord Plant's distinctive
contribution to thinking on the left has been to grapple with the
intellectual challenge of the new right.
Before it became fashionable among Labour intellectuals Lord Plant accepted
the liberal critique of economic planning set out by Friedrich von Hayek.
Yet his willingness to look at new ideas is firmly bedded in core Labour
values, developed during his childhood in Grimsby where his father was a
fireman, his mother a dinner lady. A late developer, Lord Plant failed the
11-plus and went into the secondary modern stream of a comprehensive.
He took his philosophy degree at King's College, London, discovering his
vocation in political philosophy only after abandoning plans to become an
Anglican priest. His first job was teaching philosophy at Manchester
University. In 1979, he took up his chair at Southampton where he has
remained ever since.
Though he has long since left the working-class community of Grimsby, Lord
Plant remains wedded to egalitarian objectives. But he is also clear that
the social conditions which produced two largely class-based political
parties have now disappeared. In a more pluralistic society, he argues, a
voting system is needed which is not designed simply to award victory to the
party with the highest vote under the first-past-the-post system.
The PR mechanism recommended by the Plant Inquiry is an untried system
devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours MP. It was not Lord Plant's first
choice, nor is it clear whether it will always produce a more proportional
result than first-past-the-post (a similar electoral system produced a
highly unproportional distribution of seats in the recent French general
election).
However, Lord Plant is content with the outcome, and believes it is a step
towards an electoral system which is more appropriate for the 1990s. It is
also the option which involves the minimum disruption of existing
constituencies and is thus least likely to encounter opposition from MPs
worried about losing their seats.
It is unlikely that all of Labour's frontbench will agree with the report
even though electoral reform has gathered support in the party. When Kinnock
resigned, PR lost the implicit - if undeclared - backing of the leader. Mr
John Smith, the new leader, is unconvinced of the wisdom of electoral
reform, as are many of his Scottish colleagues. It is not hard to see why:
Labour holds two-thirds of the seats in Scotland on just 39 per cent of the
popular vote, and would lose seats on a fairer system.
But the proponents of PR will not easily be silenced. Unless the party can
resolve its differences over electoral reform, Lord Plant's efforts may
prove academic.

FT  03 APR 93 / Leading Article: The lure of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic investors were out in force at the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn
auction of 20-year gilt-edged stock on Wednesday. But so, too, were the
foreigners; and that suggests that there is at least one respect in which
the chancellor's Budget strategy has started to work. There is nothing that
bond investors and currency markets like more than the sound of a domestic
electorate wailing about tax increases and spending cuts.
Hence the stability of sterling over the past 10 days and the success of an
auction that was regarded by analysts as far from a foregone conclusion.
Having established a floor under sterling the authorities will now be hoping
that this was a mere down payment - the start of a great tidal flow of
foreign capital into gilts.
For those British investors who have been brought up to regard gilt-edged
stock as one of the more effective ways of blowing an inheritance, this is
all a little baffling. But in a global market there will always be investors
for whom someone else's government's bonds, however suspect to the native
eye, will appear more attractive than their own. This is particularly true
when viewed from the perspective of the world's biggest creditor country,
Japan.
While the Japanese equity market was suffering from a collapse as severe as
the Wall Street crash of 1929, yen bond prices were rising at an astonishing
rate. Investors who bought at the bottom in autumn 1990 had nearly doubled
their money by February of this year. But then the party came to an end,
just as the equity market started to recover.
With government bond yields back around the 4 1/4 -4 1/2 per cent range,
compared with just under 4 per cent a month ago, the case for investing in
British gilts at 8 1/2 per cent looks more compelling, especially for
insurance companies that are permitted to pay bonuses out of income, but not
out of capital.
Much the same argument applies elsewhere. With the US economy recovering,
the dollar weakening further against the yen and the post-election bond
market boomlet at an end, recession-hit Europe is the obvious place for the
Japanese to go. All they have to do is to convince themselves of the
credibility of a given currency parity, and the extra income over and above
the yield on Japanese bonds becomes attractive.
French bonds
An obvious case in point is France, now that the elections are out of the
way. It is clear that French real rates of interest are too high, because of
the commitment to the franc fort policy. It is also clear that D-Mark rates,
to which French rates are tied via the Exchange Rate Mechanism, will come
down in the course of the year, since output in the German economy has been
contracting sharply. If the French manage to stay within the ERM, short-term
interest rates will fall closer to German rates, reflecting a reduction in
the risk premium - the compensation required by the market for not being in
more stable D-Marks. And this in turn will exert a gravitational pull on
long bond rates, which now stand at around 7 1/4 per cent, compared with an
underlying inflation rate of around 2 per cent.
Increased credibility
Certainly the credibility of the franc appears to have increased over the
past month. Three month Euro franc interest rates have come down from 12 to
10 per cent since late February - far more than the comparable decline in
D-Mark rates from 8.25 to 7.88 per cent. So the risk premium is narrowing.
The new French government, meantime, is helping the process by tightening
fiscal policy and promising independence for the Bank of France by August.
But before jumping to the conclusion that the market in European integration
is making a comeback, it is important to recognise that international
investors can have short time horizons. Today they are impressed by the
anti-inflationary credentials of Mr Edouard Balladur, who heads the new
centre-right government. But if strains develop in Franco-German relations
and rising unemployment causes political ructions, the market will suddenly
remember that it was Mr Balladur, who as minister of finance in the incoming
Chirac government in 1986, responded to over-high real rates of interest by
prompting an immediate devaluation of the franc within the ERM.
Nor are the wider tensions within the ERM resolved. The Danish referendum in
May provides another hurdle for the system. With the peseta looking
vulnerable on fundamentals, a far bigger hurdle may be presented by the
Spanish elections in the autumn. The currency markets are still willing to
test the weaker members of the system. If the result is realignment, then
the franc could come back into the firing line.
For the British government, the currency markets are no longer such a
daunting obstacle. But with a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing
requirement, their verdict remains important because it holds the key to
future funding. The authorities will be put to the test monthly, in each new
gilt auction. It may not always be so comfortable.

FT  03 APR 93 / Goodfellas and bad politics: Italy's corruption
investigations are now targeting the links between the state and the Mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giulio Andreotti had just sat down to lunch in the foreign press club in
Rome and was talking with his characteristic mix of understatement and
deadpan humour.
Suddenly the lights went out to the sound of confusion in the kitchens. The
74-year-old veteran of Italian politics was completely unperturbed. The tone
of his voice never altered. When the lights came back on, it was as if
nothing had happened.
Seven times prime minister, in public office since the beginning of the
post-war republic, and a life senator, Mr Andreotti has always appeared
unflappable. Even now that he has been notified by Palermo magistrates that
he is under investigation for consorting with the Mafia, he has not lost his
nerve. He has simply brushed aside the allegation.
But if Mr Andreotti has kept calm, those around him in Italy's Christian
Democrat party have been thrown into complete disarray by the latest turn of
events in Italy's corruption scandals. Collusion with the Mafia is far more
serious than simply taking bribes, and opens up the darker side of the
party's long-standing strength in the whole of southern Italy. It places
firmly on the table the frequently aired suspicion that organised crime has
thrived in good measure because politicians have provided a protective
umbrella.
'The real novelty disturbing the nation's conscience is that we are
confronted by the lid being lifted off the Christian Democrats,' Mr Achille
Occhetto, leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS)
said yesterday. 'The whole basis on which their power structure has been
built and exercised has been hit; and hit at its very centre.'
Palermo magistrates are not alone in implicating Mr Andreotti. This week,
parliament's anti-Mafia commission published a report exclusively devoted to
the links between the Mafia and politics dating back to the second world
war. The report, compiled by Mr Luciano Violante, a highly respected judge
and left-wing deputy, observes: 'On the basis of documents at the disposal
of the commission, there is an obligation to ascertain the eventual penal
liability of Mr Andreotti.'
The Christian Democrats have good reason to be alarmed. The involvement of
Mr Andreotti marks a significant new phase in the corruption scandals which
began to emerge in February last year.
Until now, magistrates have concentrated on unravelling an elaborate
countrywide network of illicit financing of the main parties by trading
favours and patronage. The qualitative change involves a shift away from
investigating the abuse of power and influence, often for crude personal
enrichment, to stripping bare the levers of power themselves.
These have been held unchallenged by the Christian Democrats since 1946. The
Socialists, apparently the principal culprits in the corruption scandals,
were late-comers on the scene - essentially from the 1980s onwards. They
have taken part in an extensive rape of the state by controlling, or
sharing, important areas of patronage; but they have never exercised control
of the apparatus of state, the so-called 'sotto governo'.
This is one of those untranslatable phrases that abound in the Italian
political vocabulary. Literally it means 'behind-the-scenes government', and
refers to the less visible side of power exercised by the political parties
through the security services, the tutelage of the bureaucracy and
manipulation of the judiciary.
For decades, it is has been more important to dominate the 'sotto governo'
than the government. The executive branch of government, as represented by
the Cabinet, has rarely had the opportunity to establish its authority,
simply because governments have changed so often. Indeed, the fact that
Italy has had 51 post-war governments has strengthened the 'sotto governo'
at the expense of the executive.
The parallel system of government was reinforced by two inter-related
factors - an electoral system that encouraged weak coalitions and failed to
produce an alternance in power; and the existence of the Cold War. The
Christian Democrats have consistently been the dominant party and the
leading partner in every coalition. Even in last April's elections, when a
disillusioned electorate deserted the traditional parties, they still hung
on to 29 per cent of the vote thanks largely to their patronage in Rome and
the south.
The Cold War enabled the Christian Democrats to present themselves as
champions of anti-communism. Equally important, according to the anti-Mafia
commission, the communist threat encouraged an alliance dating back to 1943
between the authorities and the Sicilian Mafia, the Cosa Nostra. This
alliance was justified for reasons of state security and became part of
undeclared policy, exploiting the Mafia's conviction that the organisation
had most to fear from the advent of the communists.
Arguably, the traumatic process of change now engulfing Italy would not have
happened if there had been a genuine change at the ballot box or if the
second world war alliance with the Mafia had not been extended into the Cold
War. As it was, the Mafia became an arm of anti-communism in return for a
fairly well-defined but tacit agreement on the tolerance of their illicit
activities. Over the years an increasingly complex linkage has grown up
between the 'sotto governo' and the Mafia.
Control of the alternative system of government has ensured that none of the
regime's dirty linen has ever been fully aired in public, only tantalising
glimpses. Dossiers were buried by pliant judges, inquisitive magistrates
were transferred so that the truth never emerged about a number of murky
incidents.
For instance, the obscure circumstances surrounding the kidnap and execution
by the terrorist group the Red Brigades of Christian Democrat prime minister
Aldo Moro in 1978 - was he allowed to be killed because he was seeking to
break his party's traditional hostility, and deal with the communists? Was
General Alberto Dalla Chiesa, the prefect (police chief) of Palermo,
murdered by the Mafia in 1982 on political orders because he knew too much
about the Moro affair? Were the shadowy bankers Mr Michele Sindona and Mr
Roberto Calvi murdered because they were inconvenient to both the Mafia and
certain members of the government? Was the wave of extreme right-wing
violence in the 1970s orchestrated to create a climate of tension?
Only now are these puzzling events involving occult financing, assassination
and political intrigue beginning to become clearer. The anti-Mafia
commission report talks of the Cosa Nostra becoming a 'non-secondary
pro-western front', which was allowed to carry out 'continuous repressive
actions'. This 'co-habitation', the report concludes, 'has contributed to
the weakening of the democratic system and made Italy unique in the western
world for its political assassinations and outrages'.
In other words, the co-habitation between Mafia and politics helps explain
the gaps in a chunk of Italy's post-second world war history. It is now a
likely thesis that the Mafia wanted, for instance, to get rid of Gen Dalla
Chiesa because he posed a threat to their organisation. Certain politicians
also found his presence inconvenient because he knew too much about the Moro
kidnapping and the infiltration of the Red Brigades by the security
services. The latter were exploiting the Red Brigades in a strategy of
tension to discredit the left and prevent the communists sharing power with
the Christian Democrats.
Mr Calvi almost certainly did not commit his improbable suicide on
Blackfriars Bridge in 1982 but was killed by Mafia hit-men, partly because
he double-crossed Cosa Nostra clans over money, but also because he knew too
much about illicit funding of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties.
The scandal of the secret masonic lodge, P2, run by grandmaster Mr Licio
Gelli, was hushed up because it threatened to lay bare a parallel system of
power in which the Mafia were also involved.
When Mr Tomas Buscetta, a former Mafia boss, first decided to co-operate
with US and Italian justice officials and inform on his former clan members
in the mid-1980s, the one area he refused to discuss was Cosa Nostra's
political connections. Only last September did he judge the time ripe to
make a series of delphic pronouncements.
Times had changed, he said, following the assassination in March 1992 of Mr
Salvatore Lima, the Euro-MP ally of Mr Andreotti and the most powerful
Christian Democrat politician in Sicily, and the brutal killings of the two
anti-Mafia magistrates Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino. He
confirmed widely held suspicions that Mr Lima was the main link man between
Cosa Nostra and Rome. He was murdered because he failed to find a compliant
judge who would reduce a series of sentences on Mafia bosses.
Of the 175 former Mafia members now 'singing' under special plea-bargaining
programmes, at least three besides Mr Buscetta have pointed the finger at
Rome and implicated Mr Andreotti, as the master of 'sotto governo'. This,
too, is the implication behind this week's anti-Mafia commission report.
Palermo magistrates who are seeking to have Mr Andreotti's parliamentary
immunity waived, yesterday flew to the US to interview Mr Buscetta to see if
he is prepared to name names.
A prominent appeals court judge, Mr Corrado Carnevale, is also under
investigation for being linked to the Mafia (as well as two others in Naples
for their links with the local Mafia, the Camorra). But it is going to be
hard to pin proof on the politicians. The principal evidence comes from the
mouths of the pentiti, the plea-bargaining members of the Mafia who have
changed sides. As Mr Andreotti observed wryly this week, they are no saints.
But as lawyers point out, the state is using these pentiti to bring
prosecutions against Mr 'Toto' Riina, the acknowledged boss of Cosa Nostra,
captured earlier this year.
The corruption scandals themselves have set in motion a chain reaction.
Those who have been either part, or victims, of the system are coming
forward to confess. The governance of the city of Naples, whose economy has
long been supported by a combination of politically tolerated contraband and
theft from the public purse, has been laid bare in less than a month. More
than 400 politicians, businessmen, officials and members of the Camorra have
been arrested.
Palermo is moving slower but there is a will for the truth to come out,
especially as the memory of the brutal murder of loyal servants of the state
like Mr Falcone and Mr Borsellino is still fresh. The Christian Democrats
looked strong enough to survive corruption scandals linked to construction
contracts and personal kickbacks and to reform themselves. But the discredit
from their links with the Mafia is profound, and is hastening the end of the
first republic.

FT  03 APR 93 / The going gets tough for Asian finance: The Bank of
England's dispute with Albaraka has raised the spectre of BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEIKH Saleh Abudallah Kamel is remarkably phlegmatic for a man who has had
to start repaying Pounds 83m in deposits to 10,000 depositors after an
unresolved dispute with the Bank of England. 'The Bank was very tough, and I
am glad about that,' he says. 'They should be tough with banks.'
But the enforced suspension of his Albaraka International Bank's
deposit-taking activities has raised questions about whether the Bank is
being too tough with lending to Asian businesses in the wake of the closure
of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International nearly two years ago.
The Albaraka situation is the latest in a series of incidents involving
banks with links to Britain's Asian community. The putting into
administration of the Equatorial Bank last month followed the winding up of
the Mount Banking Corporation on the Bank's initiative in October.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, has called for a parliamentary
inquiry into the Bank of England's treatment of banks' lending to Asian
businesses. He says it seems 'more than a coincidence' that the Bank has
been so strict.
The Albaraka case carries echoes of BCCI. The Bank of England appears to
have believed that the Albaraka's true 'mind and management' were in Saudi
Arabia although it does not operate as a bank there.
The Bank seems to have feared another case of a bank not supervised
adequately in any country although operating in several. As a result of
BCCI, international central bank supervisors insist on banks being
supervised on a consolidated basis in a 'home' country, the judgment of
which other countries can rely on. The Bank insisted yesterday it had no
argument with banks operating according to Islamic Sharia principles. In
Albaraka's case this means not dealing in pork products or armaments. The
bank also does not pay or charge interest on deposits or loans.
Islamic principles are not bad for profits. Sheikh Kamel says Albaraka could
not persuade Islamic banks elsewhere in the world to dilute his shareholding
 -and so take a stake in Albaraka - because they make 100 per cent returns
on equity compared with returns of below 10 per cent among most British
banks.
However, Albaraka and the Bank remain divided on whether it would be good
for Albaraka to have a broader-based ownership structure. The Bank seems to
have thought that this might dilute the control of Albaraka from Jeddah, and
turn it into a truly British bank which could be properly supervised.
Sheikh Kamel says he will try to offer a different form of ownership to the
Bank by June. But he believes his sole ownership has been good for
depositors because he feels a sense of responsibility towards them. Last
year he injected Pounds 15m of capital.
'I am responsible for every penny if I am the only owner. If there are a
thousand owners, how can any of them be truly responsible?' he says. The
Sheikh also argues that the Basle principles for consolidated supervision
are wrong, and that his group's 22 banks should operate independently.
Sheikh Kamel says the effort to have the holding company's banks supervised
from a single country, leaving the Bank to rely on foreign supervision as a
'host' country, is misguided. 'The Saudi authorities cannot control my acts
in London. That is what happened in the case of BCCI,' he says.
Bank of England officials believe the cases of Mount and Equatorial are
wholly different, although they also operated across borders, and lent to
British Asians. Both banks were affected by provisions against bad loans,
which eventually led to a loss of confidence and the withdrawal of deposits.
The fortunes of such banks have partly been affected by the closure of BCCI
and a loss of confidence in smaller banks.
The Bank last week disclosed that it had launched a series of financial
'lifeboats' in the second half of 1991 to support a number of small and
medium-sized financial institutions.
Whether the Bank could have performed a different role in the Mount and
Equatorial closures may thus be irrelevant to the main problem: that the
BCCI closure has had a damaging effect on Asian finance. The emergence of a
public dispute over Albaraka is only a symptom of this difficulty.

FT  03 APR 93 / EC backs Red Hot TV ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday backed the British government's plan to
outlaw Red Hot Television, a pornographic television channel transmitted
into the UK, Andrew Hill writes.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC commissioner for audiovisual policy, said
the measures outlined by the UK were compatible with EC law and Brussels
would not be raising any objections.
Red Hot Television, originally called Red Hot Dutch, is thought to be
transmitted via satellite from Denmark, and is received by subscribers using
decoders sold under licence from a Dutch-registered channel.
The commission said it was unable to confirm where the broadcaster was
established, or which member state had jurisdiction over the channel.
But Mr Pinheiro said member states were obliged to take action against
broadcasts which 'might impair the physical, mental or moral development of
minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous
violence'.

FT  03 APR 93 / Business may win postal discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE BUSINESS users may be given greater scope to secure discounts from the
Post Office through sorting their own letters and delivering them in bulk to
designated collection points, Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry
minister, told the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
While ruling out complete deregulation of letter deliveries, he indicated
that the wider use of 'downstream access' to introduce greater competition
was among the options being considered.
Insisting that full de-regulation would not be appropriate, Mr Leigh said
'some routes would be inherently unprofitable, and a free market would not
provide them at an affordable price'.
Mr Leigh reaffirmed that it was intended to maintain a universal postal
service with a uniform tariff so as not to disadvantage less accessible
areas. On the privatisation of Parcelforce, the Post Office's parcels
division, he said the government was still considering the timing and the
most appropriate method.

FT  03 APR 93 / MP files Tyne Tees complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS ANN CLWYD, the shadow heritage secretary, yesterday made a formal
complaint to the Independent Television Commission alleging that Tyne Tees
Television had breached pledges made when it bid for its broadcast
franchise.
The Labour MP has sent a report on the performance of Tyne Tees, now part of
Yorkshire Tyne Tees, to Sir George Russell, chairman of the commission and
to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary.
Ms Clwyd argues that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire
Tyne Tees plans effectively to run down the north-east as a separate
broadcasting region.
The commission said yesterday Ms Clwyd's complaint would be fully
investigated.
The investigation is expected to focus on whether there has been any breach
of the obligations in the company's broadcasting licence, rather than in its
franchise bid document.
Ms Clwyd argues that apart from announcing more than 360 redundancies,
designed to cut costs, Tyne Tees Television is now effectively controlled
from Leeds and many of the north-east regional programmes promised in the
franchise bid are not in its schedules.
Ms Clwyd says Tyne Tees is a test case for the commission.
'The destruction of Tyne Tees as an autonomous and independent broadcaster,
which is unfolding before our eyes, demands an urgent and decisive response
from the ITC,' says Ms Clwyd.
Earlier this year Ms Clwyd made a similar formal complaint to the commission
concerning Granada Television. The commission found that Granada was not in
breach of its obligations.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in Yorkshire
Tyne Tees Television.
Tyne Tees Television last night reaffirmed its commitment to the terms of
its licence application, and said editorial and management control would
remain the responsibility of the managing director of Tyne Tees as it always
has been. The company's administrative centre would remain on Tyneside.

FT  03 APR 93 / BP announces Pounds 400m project in North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM yester-day announced the go-ahead for the Pounds 400m
development of its Forth oilfield in the North Sea as a row continued over
the controversial changes to petroleum revenue tax.
Many oil companies have said the tax changes announced in the Budget will
lead to a halving of exploration activity in the North Sea.
The row in the industry over the tax changes was further fuelled yesterday
by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil analysts, who questioned the
Treasury's forecasts for revenue from the tax measures. The analysts
estimate that the changes will raise Pounds 115m in tax over the next three
years rather than the Pounds 700m Treasury forecast.
The Treasury has defended its tax measures by saying that the previous
regime subsidised inefficient exploration. The new rules reduce the tax rate
on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. They also abolish tax
relief for exploration and appraisal work.
BP said yesterday that the Forth field, which contains about 180m barrels of
oil, will be more profitable as a result of the abolition of petroleum
revenue tax on new oilfields. Industry analysts say the Forth field could be
worth an additional Pounds 100m because of the proposed changes.
Wood MacKenzie believes that six companies, including BP, stand to gain from
the new proposals; six companies, including British Gas, will lose in the
short term, but gain in the long term; and 17 companies will be overall
losers.
The analysts say the number of wells drilled in the North Sea could drop
below 100 from 116 last year.
BP plans to bring its Forth field on stream in early 1996. The company said
yesterday that, although the field will be more profitable under the new tax
rules, they will force more efficiency in development because there will be
no chance of writing off cost overruns against tax.
The Department of Trade and Industry awarded a licence to Marathon Oil to
explore for oil in Cardigan Bay off the Welsh coast.

FT  03 APR 93 / Goldcrest man faces charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Quested, chief executive of film company Goldcrest, has been
arrested and charged with conspiring to falsify accounts in connection with
the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into Brent Walker, the property and leisure
group.
In a further widening of the prosecution more fraud charges were also
brought yesterday against Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker
chairman, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the company's former finance director.
Mr Quested, who headed Goldcrest when the film company was a Brent Walker
subsidiary, was charged with one count of conspiring with Mr Walker, Mr
Aquilina and Mr Donald Anderson, a former Goldcrest finance director, to
falsify accounting documents by over-stating profits and assets between 1984
and 1987.
Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina were charged with the same offence when they
appeared at Bow Street magistrates court yesterday. Mr Walker already faces
four charges of theft of Pounds 12.5m and false accounting, and Mr Aquilina
two counts of false accounting. The three men were remanded on bail until
April 28. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Mr Anderson whose
whereabouts are unknown.
Mr Quested took charge of Goldcrest, the British company which made
Oscar-winning films such as Chariots of Fire, in September 1987. His
appointment heralded a move downmarket in the output of the company.
Mr Quested also worked with Mr Walker when both were fellow directors of
Trilion, a USM-quoted television production company. Both resigned from the
board in February 1990. Goldcrest was sold off by Brent Walker in October
1990 with Mr Quested remaining as chief executive.
Banks led by the TSB yesterday resumed their High Court bid to have Mr
Walker declared bankrupt. They are claiming Mr Walker has breached his
obligations under the voluntary arrangement reached with creditors in
September to repay debts of over Pounds 150m. The hearing will continue next
week.

FT  03 APR 93 / Ex-chief of Eagle Trust convicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN FERRIDAY, the former chief executive of Eagle Trust, the Midlands
mini-conglomerate, was yesterday convicted of stealing more than Pounds 12m
in cash and shares from the company after the failure of its 1987 rights
issue.
After a 10-month trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Mr Ferriday was found
guilty of five counts of theft. He was remanded in custody and will be
sentenced on April 19.
Mr Ferriday stole the money and 1.7m shares in the Howden engineering group
belonging to Eagle Trust to make good personal commitments he had made to
support the issue, the jury was told.
Eagle Trust made a takeover bid for Samuelson, a film and lighting equipment
company, in autumn 1987. The bid involved a cash or shares offer for the
company, backed by a rights issue.
The stock market crash of October 1987, however, led to the Eagle Trust
share price falling from 30p to 20p.
Samuelson shareholders chose the cash option, leaving Mr Ferriday - who had
underwritten the issue personally - with a substantial sub-underwriting
commitment.
The prosecution alleged that Mr Ferriday, to meet his debts, committed the
thefts from Eagle Trust in December 1987 and January 1988, routeing the
money through Connect Parcels, the delivery company, and two off-shore
companies before bringing it back into the UK.
Fraud was suspected when, in May 1989, Eagle Trust became insolvent and
trading in its shares was suspended. The West Midlands fraud squad
instigated inquiries before passing the case to the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Ferriday did not give evidence at his trial.
The SFO is now considering its position regarding three other men who
originally stood trial alongside Mr Ferriday charged with similar offences,
but who were all removed from the trial - without being acquitted - on the
direction of the judge.
They are Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director, Mr Martin
Baker, a former finance director with the company, and Mr Leslie Goodwin, a
former chairman of Connect Parcels.
The SFO is expected to announce its decision on their cases on April 19.

FT  03 APR 93 / Reserves show fall of Dollars 1.74bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell an underlying Dollars
1.741bn in March. The fall largely reflected repayment by the government of
the last of the official short-term borrowings made in September's battle to
keep sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The repayment came as a surprise to the City, where the consensus among
economists had been that the reserves would show virtually no change last
month. However, it had no impact on UK financial markets.
The government borrowed heavily from the European Community's very
short-term financing facility to obtain foreign currency to support sterling
before it was forced to leave the ERM on September 16.
The funds repaid last month were borrowed initially for three months, then
rolled forward for a further three months as allowed under ERM rules.
The overall level of the UK's reserves fell by Dollars 1.869bn last month,
bringing the reserves at the end of March to Dollars 41.583bn, compared with
Dollars 43.452bn at the end of February. The reserves were then revalued to
reflect changes in the value of their gold and foreign currency components
in the financial year to March 31 to stand at Dollars 40.898bn, compared
with Dollars 45.027bn at the end of March last year.
The Treasury said the underlying drop in the reserves included the transfer
of 210,720 ounces of gold worth Dollars 54m to Latvia.
Included in the overall drop in the reserves was a Dollars 42m fall in the
dollar value of the Ecu10bn revolving credit facility arranged by the
government early in Sept-ember to help bolster sterling.

FT  03 APR 93 / Anger increases over Royal Navy job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT came under renewed attack yesterday over its announcement
that the Royal Navy would be cut by an extra 5,000 jobs to 50,000 by the
late 1990s.
The government will face questioning from MPs about the cuts later this
month.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee,
said he had not been expecting further cuts.
He told BBC radio: 'My committee is looking at the Royal Navy in an inquiry
at the end of this month. This will give us a great deal extra to explore.'
The committee is scheduled to take evidence from Ministry of Defence
officials on April 28, and arguments over the new reductions might lead it
to question ministers as well.
Opposition MPs have already accused the Ministry of Defence of following
Treasury orders when planning further cuts, rather than considering defence
priorities.
Some MPs were angered over the way the ministry had not made the cutback
announcement through a parliamentary statement, which would have allowed
ministers to be challenged. The news was issued instead through the
ministry's press office on Thursday.
The ministry insisted that there was no need for a formal statement because
the figure was an assessment rather than a final judgment.
The extra reduction in the Navy is the first clear indication of government
plans for further defence cuts beyond the timespan of the cuts outlined in
its Options for Change review - due to be completed in 1995.
The reduction reflects increasing pressure on the defence budget. It is also
an indication that armed forces chiefs are trying to maintain a full range
of military capabilities even if that means cutting service numbers.
The Royal Air Force is also expected to make further cuts. Under Options for
Change the defence ministry scheduled a cut from 89,000 to 75,000 between
1992 and 1995. Senior RAF officers say the pruning of support services is
now likely to leave a total of well under 70,000.
The Navy announcement has reinforced expectations that the defence ministry,
which has to find savings of Pounds 1.05bn over the next two financial
years, will make further cuts in both the surface and submarine fleets.
Defence officials say that the extra round of naval redundancies is not a
direct result of the government's change of mind about Army cuts.
However, when the government announced in February that it would restore
3,000 Army jobs and cancel two regimental mergers it made clear that the
cost would have to be met from other parts of the defence budget.

FT  03 APR 93 / Tunnelling into history: Finance might still be in question,
but under the ground and above it the Channel tunnel project is nearly ready
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRACK is laid, the platforms are in place, overhead power lines have
been erected and the first trains have been run between Britain and France.
The Channel tunnel has arrived.
Most of the construction and electrical installation has been completed
apart from the odd bit of concreting, painting, landscaping and, most
important, the fitting-out of the control towers. Commercial services are
due to start next year.
The terminals - at Coquelles in northern France and Folkestone in Kent  -
look much as they will when public services are running, down to the
foundations and overhead gantries for the toll booths.
The main structures, including control towers and amenity and rest areas,
have been completed. Facilities for customs and immigration have been
provided, even though it is not clear what border controls will be required
following the removal of trade barriers between European Community
countries.
The electricity sub-station at the Folkestone terminal which will provide
power - using French electricity - is partially operating.
Hiring and training of train crews and traffic controllers started last
year. They will be expected to speak fluent English and French. Even
toll-booth operators will attend a two-week language course.
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has hired 1,100 of the 2,650
full-time staff it will need. There will be about the same numbers of
British and French workers, with 5 per cent drawn from other nationalities.
Some big problems remain. The system has to be tested thoroughly before
Eurotunnel can receive an operating licence from a specially established
Franco-British inter-governmental commission.
Full-scale fire and evacuation tests will have to be conducted underground.
Managers will have to be satisfied that control and signalling systems will
work properly when connected up and that procedures for loading and
unloading vehicles on shuttle waggons will not delay services.
Passenger shuttles, each carrying up to 120 cars and 800 passengers, are
expected to run every 15 minutes at peak times. The 50km journey will take
about 35 minutes, at a maximum speed of 130kph.
There will also be mainline passenger and freight trains run by BR and SNCF,
the British and French rail networks, which could mean trains entering and
leaving the tunnels every three minutes.
Delivery of locomotives and wagons has already been delayed. A dispute over
costs between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link, the consortium of five
British and five French construction companies building the Pounds 8bn-plus
project, could delay further commissioning and testing.
The opening date, originally planned for May, has been put back to December
and Eurotunnel says it could open either side of Christmas. Some
construction companies say it may not open until March or even later next
year.
No matter who wins in the row over costs, the system is built. Even in the
unlikely event that Eurotunnel failed, somebody would take over the project.
All that is needed is the passengers and the cars and history will have been
made.

FT  03 APR 93 / Spain is accused in ferry row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday accused Spain of breaching European Community obligations
by seeking to prevent Cenargo International, a British shipping company,
from introducing a ferry service between southern Spain and Morocco, Ivor
Owen writes.
Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, told the Commons the
company was entitled to operate a service between a member state and a third
country under the single European market.
He said the government was seeking to protect the legitimate interests of
Cenargo, which would incur substantial losses if the service could not start
later this month. 'It is the whole principle of the single market which is
at issue,' said Mr Norris.
He welcomed the decision of the European Commission to institute infraction
proceedings against Spain, but noted that the process would take 'a great
deal of time to complete'.

The 20 areas in which the highest proportion of the working population were

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKIPPER of the French trawler La Calypso, which abducted three Royal
Navy officers on Sunday, was under arrest last night.
Earlier his vessel had been boarded by officers from the fisheries
protection vessel HMS Jersey and escorted into St Peter Port, Guernsey, in
the Channel Islands.
The vessel was detained for failing to obey lawful commands on Sunday, when
three naval officers who had boarded it because of suspicions that it was
fishing illegally in British waters were held on board and taken to
Cherbourg, France.
La Calypso was boarded close to the British six-mile limit, the Ministry of
Agriculture said.
The French maritime authority in Cherbourg said La Calypso was 'totally at
fault' in sailing into British waters.
But a spokeswoman for the French fishermen of lower Normandy accused the
Royal Navy of 'severe provocation'.
France's new conservative government has moved swiftly to try to quell the
fishermen's protests.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, at a meeting in Paris with Mr Douglas
Hurd, his British counterpart, yesterday reiterated France's commitment to
maintain the existing Franco-British agreement on Channel Islands fishing.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, announced that he would
meet fishermen's leaders on Tuesday.
Last weekend's clash followed weeks of violent protests from French
fishermen who want restraints on fish imports.

FT  03 APR 93 / Building societies free to form captive insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to allow building societies to set up their own insurance
companies to protect them against repossession losses. The move follows
complaints that general insurers' terms have become too expensive and
restrictive.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that the rule preventing societies
owning more than 15 per cent of a non-life insurance company was being
relaxed to allow them to establish 'captive' insurers to write their own
mortgage indemnity policies.
The chancellor's disclosure came in a speech to the Council of Mortgage
Lenders in London in which he also emphasised that the government would not
compete too hard with societies for retail funds through its National
Savings products.
Mr Lamont said the government was not aiming this year for a net inflow to
National Savings of more than about Pounds 4.1bn, the figure for the past
financial year. He said changes to National Savings were not designed to
'scoop the pool'.
Mr Lamont also disclosed that the government's scheme to take 16,000 empty
properties off the market by allocating Pounds 577m to housing associations
to purchase homes had more than achieved its target with 18,000 houses
purchased by the end of last month.
The chancellor welcomed signs of stabilising house prices and the hope it
offered to owners with negative equity, but emphasised that the government
did not want to see a return to the 'rampant house-price inflation' of the
late 1980s. He said: 'We can now look forward not just to a recovery in the
housing market, but a recovery which offers the prospect of greater
stability in the future.'
He sounded a positive note on the economy as a whole, saying that over the
past month 'nearly every indicator has pointed to recovery'. Such signs also
augured well for an improvement in the housing market.
The decision to allow captive insurers comes after tough negotiations
between the general insurers and the societies. The insurance companies have
insisted on substantial rises in premiums to cover their past losses on
repossessions. Insurance companies made losses estimated at more than Pounds
2bn on mortgage indemnity insurance taken out on properties bought in the
late 1980s. They have now set a series of restrictions on the types of
properties they will insure.
Societies welcome the relaxation of the restriction on them owning captive
insurers. Woolwich Building Society indicated that it intended to set up a
subsidiary if it obtained permission at its annual meeting this month.
However, few other societies will be able to establish captive insurers in
less than a year, because most have just held their annual meetings at which
proposals for a rule change to enable the move would have had to be
discussed.
Woolwich, which anticipated the move by putting forward a special resolution
to its annual general meeting on April 15, said it was 'delighted' that the
new power had been given to societies. Mr Peter Robinson, managing director,
said: 'We have been interested in this route to cover some of the risk
exposure from future residential lending for some time. Armed with the
necessary powers, we will actively pursue the opportunity.'
Mr Chris Sharp, managing director of the Northern Rock Building Society and
chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that anything which gave
societies more flexibility to arrange insurance was 'very welcome'.
Abbey National said on Thursday that it had established a captive insurer
based in Guernsey with Pounds 10m of capital to write mortgage indemnity
insurance on mortgage loans made this year. It is seeking reinsurance of the
risk.
Mr Dane Douetil, a director of the insurance brokers Special Risk Services,
said that captive insurance companies gave societies more flexibility and
would be tax-efficient, but they still faced reinsurance negotiations.
Legal &amp; General, one of the primary mortgage indemnity insureres said last
night that it was 'relaxed' about the change because societies' captives
will not be allowed to write the more lucrative house and contents policies.

FT  03 APR 93 / Union wins ruling on pupil testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's programme of school testing received a further serious
rebuff yesterday when the High Court rejected an attempt to stop a teachers'
union boycotting national curriculum tests and assessments.
The London borough of Wandsworth failed to win a High Court injunction to
stop a boycott of testing by members of the NASUWT, the second-largest
teachers' union.
The decision increases the likelihood that union action against the tests
will spread to other unions. The three largest teaching unions begin their
annual conferences next week and there will be strong pressure from members
of the NUT, the largest union, and the normally moderate ATL, to join the
action.
Both head teachers' unions have warned that boycotts could force heads to
abandon tests and stop the collection of the data used to compile school
performance league tables.
The NASUWT boycott of testing was imposed after members voted overwhelmingly
for action. The tests imposed an 'excessive and unreasonable workload', the
union said.
Wandsworth said the union's members would be acting in breach of employment
contracts and of their statutory duty to carry out continuous assessment of
pupils' attainments and to record the results by the end of May.
Teachers were also under a duty to conduct national curriculum test
assessments during two weeks in June, the council claimed.
Mr Justice Mantell however ruled that the industrial action was a legal
trade dispute under the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992 because it was wholly or mainly about workload or
working hours and therefore about terms of conditions and employment.
He rejected the borough's claim that members of the union had a statutory
duty to implement the national curriculum.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, said the borough would be
seeking urgent legal advice on whether to appeal. A date for an appeal
hearing has been set for the third week in April if an appeal is lodged.
The Department for Education issued a brief statement last night reiterating
the government's commitment to testing.
However, Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said it was a
'stunning victory' and a great day for all teachers and pupils.

FT  03 APR 93 / Employers are checking out from check-off: David Goodhart
looks at a new weapon in industrial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S decision to stop deducting National Union of Mineworkers'
dues from miners' pay highlights the way the check-off arrangement is
increasingly being used as an industrial relations weapon.
During the past 25 years unions in many industries have come to rely on
check-off arrangements, under which employers collect union dues for them,
as a cheap and efficient method of collection. Individuals are also far less
likely to question their union membership if, after granting initial
permission to check-off, they are not being asked every week or month to
think about whether it is giving them value for money.
The current system is, in any case, being changed by the employment bill now
passing through the House of Lords and due to become law before parliament's
summer recess. The law will then require unions and employers to seek
employees' agreement to check-off at least every three years. Some unions
fear that could hit membership by up to 20 per cent.
But even before the proposal to change the law several employers, especially
in the public sector, had withdrawn or threatened to withdraw from check-off
arrangements.
In 1988 the Home Office withdrew the arrangements from members of the Prison
Officers Association in response to a dispute. The effect in prisons was
actually to strengthen the union and increase its membership, all of whom
now pay their dues by direct debit.
The Prison Officers Association's job was easier than it will be for general
unions because it has a good record of where all its members are.
The effect on the NUM in the 38 pits which joined yesterday's one-day strike
is, similarly, likely to be small. The union members are geographically
concentrated and the union has a well-structured branch system.
Most of the 20,000 NUM members affected by the decision are likely to go on
paying the Pounds 3 a week to their branch which will pass it on to the NUM
regions, where most of the money is supposed to go.
Other unions will find the withdrawal of check-off much more difficult. When
the RMT rail union recently threatened a strike on London Underground the
threatened withdrawal led to a peaceful settlement.
RMT is financially stretched. Many of its railway members have strong union
loyalties, but they are often dispersed over a wide area and rarely have
contact with branch officials.
For that reason some British Rail officials were yesterday speculating that
withdrawal of check-off might be part of a tougher response to a second
one-day strike on the railways.

FT  03 APR 93 / Leyland Daf rescue suffers double blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to rescue Leyland Daf, the beleaguered UK truck and van maker,
suffered two serious setbacks yesterday.
One of the company's main components suppliers, Automotive Products,
announced that it had stopped delivering crucial components to the Leyland
Daf plants.
It also emerged that Iveco Ford Truck, Leyland Daf's main rival in the UK,
is seeking to persuade 11 of Leyland Daf's 52 main dealers to change
franchise.
Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the joint administrative receivers
for Leyland Daf, failed in the High Court yesterday to gain an order
compelling Automotive Products to continue supplying components, chiefly
brake assemblies and clutches, to the truck-assembly plant at Leyland,
Lancashire, and to the van plant in Birmingham.
The receivers warned that production could be halted at the van plant as
early as Monday and truck assembly could be stopped by late next week.
It is understood that as many as 15 components suppliers are refusing to
supply Leyland Daf, although the Automotive Products case is the most
critical.
Automotive Products, a subsidiary of the BBA group, is refusing to deliver
more brake and clutch components until it is paid more than Pounds 758,000
that it says it is owed for parts supplied before Leyland Daf went into
receivership in February.
It would take Leyland Daf months to establish an alternative supplier.
Counsel for the receivers argued in the High Court that Automotive Products
was in breach of European Community trading law by abusing its dominant
position as a supplier and holding the company to ransom.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that 'it was not seriously
arguable' that Automotive Products' conduct infringed EC law. He said it
would be improper to express any view on the criticism of Automotive
Products' conduct.
The receivers are expected to take the case to the Court of Appeal early
next week.
It is understood that Leyland Daf owed unsecured trade creditors about
Pounds 82m when it collapsed into receivership.
Mr John White, BBA group managing director, said yesterday that the company
was continuing to negotiate with the receivers. 'We are still very happy to
supply if either we get paid or if we get our goods back.'
Mr White said that BBA had a 'retention to title' clause in its supply
contract with Leyland Daf. He added: 'I advised the receiver that I cannot
continue to supply unless I receive substantial monies due to me, or the
receiver recognises my right to recovery of the goods.'
Iveco Ford Truck, which narrowly lost the leadership of the UK truck market
to Leyland Daf in 1991 and 1992, announced that three of Leyland Daf's
leading dealers were joining the Iveco Ford franchise.
Mr Alan Fox, Iveco Ford managing director, said heads of agreement had been
signed with a further three dealers and negotiations were at an advanced
stage with five more.

FT  03 APR 93 / New Hoover chief makes cost cutting top priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new head of Hoover said yesterday that his top priority was to cut the
company's operating losses, after admitting that worsening problems in its
free flights promotion scheme had led him to take up the job earlier than
planned.
'My real mission here is to look after the profitability of the business,'
Mr Gerald Kamman, managing director of Hoover UK and president of Hoover
Europe, said. 'We are concerned about the operating profitability of the
company.' Mr Kamman, who arrived in Britain from the US on Monday, said this
concern was the principal reason for his appointment, though his predecessor
would probably not have been dismissed had the free flights scheme not gone
so badly wrong.
One of his first actions had been to summon Hoover's 75 top UK managers and
European sales subsidiaries to a meeting, at which he told them the company
must improve its efficiency.
He planned to review Hoover's management structure and did not know whether
he would replace the company's vice-president of marketing and the director
of marketing services, who also left the company this week.
He had not yet decided how to tackle Hoover's losses, which partly reflected
operating cost problems. He would not say whether the measures to be taken
would include redundancies. Last year Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m,
after a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m.
Mr Kamman said Maytag, the US domestic appliance manufacturer which owns
Hoover, had brought forward his appointment after it became clear that the
costs of the company's free flights programme far exceeded earlier
estimates. He had not realised the full extent of the difficulties until his
arrival. However, he insisted that the Dollars 30m after-tax charge against
earnings, announced by Maytag on Tuesday, would fully cover the cost of
meeting Hoover's obligations to customers under the programme.
'I'm hopeful that when it's over, we will have a few quid in the bank,' Mr
Kamman said. 'We erred intentionally on the high side when calculating the
cost.'
He declined to say how many purchasers of Hoover products had applied for
free flights or how many applications had been satisfied. 'Some of the
redemption rates are not even known. Some certificates are not due in for
several weeks,' he said.
'We are honourable people and the Hoover name stands for integrity.'
Hoover last night said that its news release about the departure of Mr
Michael Gilbey, director of marketing services, could have been read as
suggesting he was dismissed.
It added: 'In fact, Mr Gilbey was made redundant as a result of a
restructuring of Hoover's marketing departments.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Imports ban after cattle tested
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTS OF cattle from the Czech and Slovak republics were banned by the
Ministry of Agriculture yesterday after positive tests for foot and mouth
disease. The ban also applies to pigs, deer, sheep, goats and other
susceptible cloven-hoofed animals.
There have been 51 outbreaks of the disease in Italy this year, with eastern
Europe suspected as the source, and thousands of animals have been
slaughtered.
The ministry said the positive tests did not necessarily indicate that
animals were infected, as those vaccinated against the disease showed a
similar reaction.

President Kim Young-sam yesterday fired two key generals considered loyal to
past military-dominated regimes in a move to consolidate civilian control of
the military, AP reports from Seoul. The moves were part of Kim's bid to
bring changes after 32 years of military intervention in politics and push
ahead with broad political and economic reforms. As the first civilian
president since 1961, Kim has tried to curb the power of the military and
security organizations. The 65-year-old former dissident was persecuted by
military-dominated regimes.

The Nigerian government is under increasing pressure to begin phasing out
its petroleum price subsidy, Paul Adams reports from Lagos. In the past two
weeks, anticipation of the price rise has spurred the racketeering which
causes much of the domestic supply of 300,000 barrels a day to be smuggled
abroad. A tanker of fuel worth N40,000 at official prices can fetch N1.2m in
neighbouring Francophone states. Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister in the
transitional council, acknowledged to industry leaders yesterday that the
price rise was necessary to stop the chronic mismanagement of Nigeria's oil
assets.

FT  03 APR 93 / Paris tackles Gatt as urgent priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE's new government yesterday announced that a re-appraisal of the Gatt
trade negotiations was its 'most urgent' economic priority, as its foreign
minister crossed swords with his UK counterpart on the issue.
At his first formal cabinet meeting, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, asked his trade and farm ministers to draw up proposals to reflect
the new conservative government's unhappiness with the course which the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks have taken recently.
On Tuesday Mr Balladur will receive leaders of France's farmers, who are
against November's draft EC-US farm accord, as well as leaders of fishermen
who have separate grievances with Brussels about cheap fish imports.
After an otherwise harmonious meeting in Paris with Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK
foreign secretary, Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, said France
wanted 'the time to put the international trade dossier on a new footing'.
Recalling the previous French government's position, Mr Juppe complained of
lack of balance, in the November transatlantic farm deal and in the Gatt
negotiations, between concessions in agriculture and non-farm aspects of
trade.
Mr Hurd said it was 'perfectly natural' the new French government 'should
need a certain time to establish its position'. But he stressed Britain's
view that last November's farm deal, reducing the EC's subsidised farm
exports and oilseed output, was balanced.
'We don't want to see it unpicked on this side of the Atlantic, because
there are plenty of people on the other side of the Atlantic who want to
unpick it,' Mr Hurd said.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the conservative politician who led the 'No' campaign in
last autumn's Maastricht referendum, has been appointed president of the
National Assembly.
The appointment places Mr Seguin, 49, who was minister of social affairs in
a past conservative administration, in a powerful position. Mr Seguin,
together with Mr Charles Pasqua, now interior minister, have lobbied
forcefully within the Gaullist RPR against France's monetary links with
Germany and the franc fort policy of maintaining a strong currency.

FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton waters down energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration has altered its plans for a new energy tax,
bowing to pressure from influential members of Congress for modifications
that would ease the tax's impact on their constituents.
The revised tax will still be levied in general at a rate of 25.7 cents per
million British thermal units, with a surcharge of 34.2 cents per million
BTUs on refined petroleum products.
But the Treasury's new proposals for the tax would exempt ethanol and
methanol, offering a sop to congressmen from agricultural states who have
complained that the Clinton budget would hurt farmers more than other
groups.
It also exempts home heating oil from the surcharge levied on petroleum
products, a concession to senators from the New England region, which is a
heavy consumer of heating oil.
One other exemption would be bunker and jet fuel used in international
transportation, a measure that will save money for US airlines, which
complain that they are already on the brink of financial catastrophe without
an additional cost.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, said the administration's aim was
that the tax should be 'borne fairly and equitably across the country and
that the tax promote conservation as well as increased reliance on domestic
energy, not foreign oil.'
To achieve this goal, he said, the administration was exploring ways of
making sure that companies would be able to pass the cost of the new tax on
to the final consumer.
Treasury officials said the changes to the structure of the tax should not
greatly affect the revenue it will raise, estimated at Dollars 71bn over
five years.
While the changes will make the tax more palatable to many members of
Congress, some supporters of President Bill Clinton's package worry that
they represent yet another fissure in the relatively unified front the
Democrats have so far managed to present.
President Clinton asked Congress, when he presented the plan, to treat it as
a whole, and not pick away at individual elements. While the House of
Representatives has largely taken him at his word on this, in the Senate
several Democrats have whittled away at components of the plan.
This week, the president had to give way on proposals to charge market rates
for grazing and mining rights on federal land, after opposition from western
senators.
Mr Clinton is particularly vulnerable in the Senate, where the Republicans
are presenting a solid show of hostility to his proposals. They have enough
votes at least to hold up consideration of legislation, and need only a
handful of Democratic defectors to inflict a defeat on the president.
Although the White House was able to win passage earlier this week for a
budget resolution containing the broad outlines of Mr Clinton's taxation and
spending proposals, it has been unable to prevail against Republican tactics
to block the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending package that the president
insists is needed to prevent the economic recovery from stalling.
Democratic congressional leaders are now threatening to keep Congress in
session through the traditional Easter recess in an effort to make the
Republicans back down.

FT  03 APR 93 / Japan surplus shows modest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's current account surplus rose a modest 8 per cent to Dollars 11.8bn
(Pounds 7.7bn) in February, as exports declined for the first time in almost
three years, suggesting that the rapid expansion of the surplus may be
nearing an end.
The Japanese government was relieved by the relatively slim increase, and
also encouraged by a 1.7 per cent rise in car sales during March, the first
year-on-year expansion in nine months.
Government officials are debating whether an economic recovery has begun or
whether favourable statistics this week, including a rise in housing starts,
are merely blips on the graph.
The positive figures were balanced by a plunge in construction orders and a
forecast of lower capital spending this year.
The debate has complicated preparations for an emergency economic package,
which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party boasts will be 'the biggest ever',
while the Finance Ministry, conscious of a fall in tax receipts, appears to
have something more modest in mind.
Japan has promised the US it will stimulate growth, and the package will be
watched closely in Washington, as the economic downturn was blamed for an
increase in exports and decline in imports which produced the surge in the
current account surplus.
The Finance Ministry said the overall balance of payments for February
showed a surplus of Dollars 1.3bn, down from Dollars 15.6bn a year earlier,
while the deficit in invisible trade fell 85 per cent to Dollars 186m.
In the long-term capital account, Japanese net sales of foreign bonds were
Dollars 3.7bn, a sharp turnaround from net purchases of Dollars 1.6bn in
January, and net sales of foreign stocks were Dollars 345m, up from Dollars
18m. The figures reflected the repatriation of funds before the close of
fiscal year last month.
Foreigners' net purchases of Japanese stocks were Dollars 249m, compared to
Dollars 131m, and net sales of bonds were Dollars 510m, against Dollars
2.6bn in the previous month.
The ministry expects stocks purchases to jump in March, as the return of
foreign investors has spurred Tokyo prices over the past two weeks.
Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said the increase in
new cars was due to renewed demand for cheaper models.
Sales of passenger cars, excluding mini-cars, rose 3.4 per cent, but sales
of trucks were still weak, down 2.4 per cent, reflecting curbs on capital
investment by most manufacturers.

MR Martin Bangemann, European Commission vice president, yesterday
criticised the US for taking a bilateral approach in trying to solve trade
issues, and said the EC should adopt a multilateral and more moderate
approach to its growing trade imbalance with Japan.
Mr Bangemann, responsible for EC industrial affairs and information and
telecommunications technology, had tough words for the US, which was trying
to impose its views on the rest of the world.
He was particularly critical of the bilateral approach adopted by the US,
which, he said, generally benefited only one party. 'If all of us start
having bilateral agreements then we are lost,' he said.
Referring to the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement through which the US has
sought 20 per cent of the market in Japan for foreign semiconductor
manufacturers, Mr Bangemann said such an approach 'is not a free market
method.'
The way to resolve trade disputes was not through bilateral agreements but
through a multilateral arrangement, like the Gatt, and through greater
co-operation between the industries of the two regions.
The widening trade imbalance with Japan was alarming, both in economic and
political terms. The EC's trade deficit with Japan grew to Dollars 31.2bn in
1992, up almost 70 per cent from Dollars 18.5bn in 1990.
What the EC and Japan needed, in order to improve the trade balance, was 'a
comprehensive new method of dealing with our economic relationship,' which
was not guaranteed market shares or any other bilateral agreement for
managed trade.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK pledges to maintain Aids research drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE UK government yesterday pledged to maintain Aids research efforts in the
face of the AZT trial results, which ministers and Aids organisations
admitted were disappointing.
'Over the past 10 years a great deal has been learnt about HIV and how it
damages the immune system, but these results show what little progress has
been made in discovering drugs which can keep people healthy for any length
of time,' said Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins
Trust, the UK's main Aids charity.
The trust is calling for greater investment in research co-ordinated between
governments and pharmaceutical companies.
Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister, stressed that a 'great deal of effort'
would go on, with the UK government expecting to spend Pounds 200m on
research and treatment in the coming year. He said the disappointing
research results reinforced the need for people to recognise that Aids could
be prevented by taking appropriate precautions.
HIV/Aids and sexual health is one of the target objectives of the UK
government's 'Health of the Nation' strategy, aimed at improving overall
health standards in the country.
The strategy attaches importance to obtaining better information about the
prevalence of HIV among the population, and since 1990 the UK department of
health has run a programme of anonymised surveys.
The World Health Organisation estimates that 10m people worldwide are
HIV-positive. In the UK, the first survey results have indicated rates of
one in 500 for women attending London ante-natal clinics.
Tests at London genito-urinary clinics show prevalence rates of one in five
for homosexual and bisexual men, and one in 100 for heterosexual men.
Aids workers are concerned that the Concorde study results - suggesting that
early AZT treatment of those infected with HIV fails to delay the onset of
Aids - may discourage people at risk coming forward for testing and
counselling, if they believe there is no treatment available.

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday foreshadowed a tightening of fiscal
policy to achieve its target of bringing the budget close to balance over
the next four years.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said there would be no 'precipitate'
attempt to eliminate the forecast deficit of ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.50bn)
for the year to June, equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
But the federal budget in August would include specific measures intended to
reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996/97.
'The government has shown in the past its willingness to adjust fiscal
policy as circumstances require. I can assure you that we will not flinch
from dealing with the emerging policy requirements.'
The treasurer's comments were underlined by Mr Ralph Willis, the finance
minister, who said the government would not rely entirely on economic growth
to reduce the deficit.
'I would think that we need to take some positive steps and not just rely on
the recovery  .. to reduce the deficit,' he said.
The ministers' comments contrast with reports official suggestions last week
that Mr Dawkins regarded the deficit as less important than a reduction in
unemployment from its near record level of 11.1 per cent.
Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit rating agency, have made it clear that a reduction in the deficit is
regarded as essential by the financial markets.
Mr Dawkins also announced a review of national savings and plans for
increased budgetary co-operation with state governments.

FT  03 APR 93 / Drug doubts hit Wellcome share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
REPORTS that AZT, the world's principal Aids drug, is ineffective for
carriers of the disease, wrongfooted London and New York broking houses
yesterday and sent shares in Wellcome, the drug's manufacturer, plummeting.
The reports relate to the biggest trial carried out so far on the drug, an
Anglo-French study involving more than 1,700 people and lasting for three
years.
Analysts yesterday were still digesting the possible impact of a study which
suggests that for 10m HIV-positive people worldwide AZT will fail to delay
the onslaught of Aids.
Wellcome's share price fell by 10 per cent when trading began in London and
ended the day 51p lower at 692p. Turnover of 15m shares in London was one of
the heaviest daily totals ever recorded.
In New York, the US equivalent of the shares opened Dollars 1 lower at
Dollars 10 1/4 but then recovered a little.
Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Peter Laing at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull
cut his forecast for Retrovir's earnings for the year to August 1995 by
Pounds 150m to Pounds 400m and for the following year by Pounds 210m to
Pounds 460m.
Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett said of the news: 'It undermines the
Wellcome marketing message for earlier use of the drug. It is the
asymptomatic population that Wellcome is targeting as offering the greatest
sales potential.'
The day before the news broke that 1.5m Aids carriers in the developed world
were unlikely to benefit from the treatment, many financial analysts had
been sceptical of its import.
They said that the 'hope factor' included in forecasts had largely been
removed as asymptomatic people, those who are HIV-positive but show no signs
of Aids, had tended to shun AZT because of side effects.
They added that Wellcome's share price had already fallen so far that it
discounted bad news and was now implying a price-earning ratio below that of
the FT-SE 100 Index.
However, the background to yesterday's selling lay in the issue last July by
Wellcome Trust of 270m shares.
The Trust raised Pounds 2.1bn in what was one of the biggest ever share
offerings and at that time optimism over the drug, also known as Retrovir,
was one plank in confidence in the company's future performance.
The global co-ordination, handled by merchant bank Robert Fleming, involved
most of the world's principal securities firms. Such houses as S G Warburg
and Cazenove in the UK, Nikko Securities of Japan and Morgan Stanley of the
US all produced hefty research extolling the strengths of the company.
After an extensive book-building exercise, the shares were finally bought by
investors at Pounds 8 each, having fallen from around Pounds 10 two months
earlier.
With no fundamental shift in the company's performance since the issue - in
fact Wellcome last week recorded better than expected pre-tax profits of
Pounds 324.6m - it has been difficult for financial analysts to justify a
shift of attitude.
However, one leading UK broker said 'people involved in the share issue may
have been slightly bullish at the time'.
Since the issue, enthusiasm for pharmaceuticals companies in general has
been hit by concern that drug prices in the US will be cut following reforms
proposed by the Clinton administration.

<TEXT>
CHINA should come forward with its own proposals on the 1995 elections to
Hong Kong's legislative council, Mr Chris Patten, governor of the British
colony said yesterday, instead of simply denouncing his plans for modest
democratic reform.
The Chinese authorities were 'trying to play the man, rather than the ball,'
in trying to discredit him as governor, Mr Patten said.
'I know the adjectives, and I know the names being called,' the governor
said, 'but what are their proposals for the 1995 elections?' In particular,
were they willing to countenance the 'fair election' of legislative council
members 'they don't like?'. And if so, would they allow them to finish their
terms - which run until 1999 - after the colony is handed back to China in
1997?
Despite China's attempts to step up pressure on Britain over the governance
of Hong Kong, Mr Patten emphasised that the UK had set no preconditions for
the resumption of talks with China to end the diplomatic stand-off.
In a spirited defence of what he called his 'quasi-democratic' reform
proposals, Mr Patten said resuming talks would be a 'better way to spend
spring in Peking than inventing new forms of denunciatory language for the
New China news agency.'
He was addressing a packed conference on the future of Hong Kong at the
Centre for European Policy Studies, the independent Brussels think-tank,
after talks with Commission president Jacques Delors.
Asked about China's appointment of Sir David Akers-Jones, a former acting
governor of Hong Kong, as an adviser to the shadow authority it has set up
for the colony, Mr Patten said: 'I don't think Sir David Akers-Jones' views
have changed much over the years.'
Sir David has attacked Mr Patten's reforms as confrontational and damaging
to Hong Kong's future, and his appointment is widely seen as a deliberate
attempt by Peking to undermine Mr Patten.
The governor said he hoped Sir David and his colleagues would give 'fair
advice, I hope they give it fearlessly, and I hope Chinese officials
listen.'
Mr Patten said his reforms were aimed merely at assuring 'clean and fair
elections in 1995', so that Hong Kong would have credible government, under
the rule of law, with an honest bureaucracy and independent courts. He said
Hong Kong's freedom was part of the explanation for its remarkable economic
success, and implied delicately that China's economic reforms would build up
new pressure for political reform.
'When people make economic decisions for themselves, they tend to want to
make political ones too.'

A COURT in Madhya Pradesh, India's largest state, has ruled that the
dismissal of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state in
December was 'invalid' and 'beyond the scope' of the constitution.
The judgment by the state's High Court is a major victory for the BJP,
India's largest opposition party, which demanded reinstatement of all four
of its dismissed state assemblies or fresh state elections.
The Madhya Pradesh government, along with three other BJP governments in
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, were dismissed by India's
ruling Congress (I) party following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque,
which sparked widespread communal violence.
Mr Sunder Lal Patwa, Madhya Pradesh chief minister, had challenged the
proclamation dismissing his government, calling it a 'political vendetta and
a gross misuse of powers' against the opposition party.
The court noted that the government had been unable to support its case for
imposing central rule only in the BJP-ruled states, while other state
governments survived despite their inability to contain post-Ayodhya
violence.
The judges said dismissal of the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh was
'wholly uncalled for'. They said the BJP government in Himachal Pradesh had
also been dismissed even though there had been no disturbances in the state
of the kind that occurred in Madhya Pradesh.
Congress I leaders voiced concern the judgment could lead to early elections
in the states. They said they would appeal to the Supreme Court.

FT  03 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Clinton tries to lead out the
cavalry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE have been 25 summits between the inhabitants of the White House and
the Kremlin in the 33 1/2 years since President Dwight Eisenhower
entertained Mr Nikita Khruschev at Camp David in September, 1959.
All of them, even President George Bush's valedictory trip to Moscow in
January to sign the Start Two treaty, were dominated by the arms control and
security issues that characterised the cold war. President Bill Clinton
meets President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Vancouver today with a different
purpose in view.
In the words of a senior administration official, 'economics have now
replaced traditional security issues as the centrepiece of US-Russian
relations'.
'Past summits,' he went on, 'were designed to minimise the harm each could
do to the other. Now the intent is to maximise the good.'
Mr Clinton himself made an eloquent pitch for the new partnership in a
speech on Thursday aimed not only, in its call for 'a strategic alliance
with Russian reform', at Americans and Russians but also at other
industrialised nations. Implicit in it was the contention that, if past
summits had seen the US take on the role of protector of its allies,
Vancouver required that US leadership be followed by G7 action.
Fine words and Mr Clinton will be laying before Mr Yeltsin a series of
practical proposals to put flesh on the bones of this promised new
'partnership'. Conventional security considerations will be on the agenda,
since there is unfinished nuclear missile business and regional conflicts to
be addressed, but the US sees them as essentially secondary now.
Mr Clinton has a lot riding on his first presidential foreign foray.
There is little disagreement with his analysis that promoting the cause of a
co-operative market-oriented Russian democracy is of immeasurable benefit to
the US. Opinion polls demonstrate broad support for his approach, as did, in
a statement this week, the four living former Republican presidents.
His problems are twofold: first the US ability to determine the course of
events in Russia itself is minimal. It may support, with words and some
money, the reform process but it cannot ensure the survival of Mr Yeltsin,
the embodiment of that reform, nor of other reform-minded leaders. 'Only the
Russians can save Russian democracy' is the administration's invariable
litany.
Second, the president has his own money problem. Officials refuse to put
dollar figures on what the bilateral offer to Mr Yeltsin will be, but
concede that, initially, it will only be drawn from funds already approved
by Congress for Russia in the last and current fiscal year, plus a little
extra. Informed speculation suggests about a Dollars 400m total this year
and Dollars 700m next, though these estimates may be low.
This recognises the domestic political reality that there is not much of a
constituency, in Congress or the country at large, for throwing large sums
of money at Russia at a time when budget cutting at home is the order of the
day.
Within these limitations, however, the bilateral US programme is designed to
be eye-catching. Officials say that three quarters of its value will be
directed 'outside of Moscow' and to 'non-governmental partners.'
Its elements are likely to include a Dollars 200m-plus privatisation support
programme, an 'enterprise fund' for new business, starting small but
growing, housing construction projects for returning Russian military
officers and men, humanitarian asssistance in the form of food and
medicines, the dispatch of US technological and management experts,
additional grain credits, and assorted energy initiatives, including,
possibly, an oil barter arrangement.
But the bilateral proposals, according to senior officials, are also seen as
'a catalyst to multilateral action.' Vancouver, they say, is part of a
continuous process, the next stage of which is the meeting of the Group of
Seven's foreign and financial ministers in Tokyo on April 14. The US expects
other nations to have announced their own individual assistance programmes
by then and that the Tokyo session takes real decisions.
Elements of the international package known to be under consideration,
perhaps worth Dollars 30bn, include a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund,
as much as Dollars 9bn in loans from the IMF, World Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, some Dollars 4bn in debt relief
this year, and a large assortment of trading credits.
A good portion of last year's Dollars 24bn package remains unspent and the
US accepts that today disbursement of more depends on Russia meeting
reasonable conditions, not least a responsible monetary policy.
Thus Mr Clinton will be pressing Mr Yeltsin for some firm commitments to
reform, to which, in Moscow's current political climate, the Russian
president may find hard to respond. The sense of US confidence is guarded.
But the alternative - sitting back and letting events in Russia take their
course - is not an option while Mr Yeltsin is in office, nor may it be for
as long as there is life in the Russianreform movement.

FT  03 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: West drawn into Russian
maelstrom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VANCOUVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Yeltsin reaches Vancouver today he will be embarrassed to learn that
his countrymen have provided a dramatic portrayal of Russia's plight. The
cruise liner Maxim Gorky has been arrested off Vancouver Island with a full
complement of passengers aboard - charged by a Miami company with not paying
its bills.
Mr Yeltsin has not paid his debts either.
He has already secured a rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club, but he
still comes with his hand out. For if a new package of reforms elaborated by
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance and the
economy, is to be implemented, it requires a vast amount of aid to be made
available, quickly, and without the kind of conditions which have blocked
critical parts of the assistance, set aside last year, from being paid.
This summit is less a getting to know a new president, more a test of his -
and his fellow western leaders' - ability and will to help.
He has going for him the west's obvious concern over the continuing threat
to the reform process which Mr Yeltsin is held to embody. This concern has
drawn declarations from the west that it means to apply assistance more
directly and more visibly than it cared, or was able, to do last year.
Mr Fyodorov's package, unveiled to the Group of Seven 'sherpas', or senior
officials in Hong Kong last month, is set at Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn);
officials close to the negotiations say he might get Dollars 10bn.
The money is to support specific projects in the energy, military conversion
and agriculture sectors. It will help create a stabilisation fund for the
rouble and support the budget, whose deficit is expected to rise to about 12
per cent of gross national product this year. It will pay for employment
schemes at a time when unemployment , now officially over 1m, is likely to
soarto more than 5m, with millions more in only part-time work.
Vancouver will be the most conspicuous of the various the various meetings
scheduled for this spring and summer to mesh Russian demands with foreign
governments' ability to pay and with their own estimations of the ability of
the Russian government to use what money will be provided.
For though there are few doubts about the severity of the interlocking
political and economic crises now convulsing Russia, there are even more
doubts than last year as to the usefulness of western support.
The struggle between Mr Yeltsin and the Russian Congress of Peoples'
Deputies has left no clear result. The Russian president has dropped plans
to hold his own plebiscite in order to brave a much tougher referendum set
by the Congress.
It means Mr Yeltsin faces a near impossible task, unless he can secure new
terms, either through the constitutional court or in backroom negotiations
with the parliamentary leadership.
Until the April 25 referendum, he will be a super populist. He has already
issued decrees almost doubling the minimum wage. Savings are to be protected
from the ravages of inflation and has raised benefits for the military. If
this is to be financed, further credits will have to be issued by the
central bank. Yet it is precisely here where his government must act if it
is to be credible in western eyes as a a reform cabinet.
Inflation is estimated to be about 30 per cent a month and rising although
Russian government officials claim it can be kept relatively stable at that
level - below the hyper-inflationary mark - others are not so sure.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, adviser to the Government, says it could easily go
out of control. 'The corrosive effect of the (present) inflation is eating
into the very marrow of the reforms,' he says. A strong advocate for
substantial foreign aid, he insists that the causes of inflation must be
stemmed before it can be properly used.
The key blockage identified by Mr Fyodorov is the the central bank and its
chairman, Mr Victor Gerashchenko. Mr Fyodorov has asked Mr Yeltsin to fire
Mr Gerashchenko - but the latter, constitutionally responsible to the
parliament rather than the president or the government, remains in place.
Western governments will naturally turn to the International Monetary Fund
for advice on what to do. The IMF was, after all, given the job of acting as
the lead agency in the former Soviet states. The agency had the task of
telling the west when the Russian government should receive the various
parts of the Dollars 24bn G7 package earmarked for such projects as, rouble
stabilisation.
Nearly half of the Dollars 24bn was made up of bilateral trade credits from
G7 countries. Most of these have been paid in the past year and most has
been used, often corruptly, for imports such as western liquor and
cigarettes.
A central problem for western governments is to ensure that the new funds
will go to the projects for which they are designed.
President Clinton this week called on the IMF to be more 'flexible' in its
criteria for lending to Russia.
Two days later, Mr Jean Foglizzo, the IMF's station chief in Moscow,
uncharacteristically made an oblique public reply to the US president saying
that 'lack of decisiveness' and no agreement between different levels of the
Russian government on how to reform would stop the Fund lending until
clarity was achieved.
The west, he said, faced an 'historic choice' - between being seen to be
doing something with fast aid, and continuing to make slow progress towards
creating a virtuous circle of reform. 'The situation in Russia today is very
alarming,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin thus comes to Vancouver at the head of a desperate country -
posing a desperately difficult problem. Can the west feel confident putting
aid into such a political maelstrom? Can it feel safe in withholding it?

FT  03 APR 93 / President plunges into sell-off debate: Christopher Bobinski
and Anthony Robinson assess Poland's privatisation difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has re-emerged as a protagonist in the Polish
privatisation debate, raising the political stakes in the latest attempt by
the coalition government to gain parliamentary backing for its modified
mass-privatisation plan.
Changes were made to the government's long-delayed plan by Mr Janusz
Lewandowski, privatisation minister, after former communists and rebels from
the right-wing christian national party had rejected the government's
original bill on March 18.
The contested aspects of the original plan included the role of foreign
managers in the proposed investment funds which would handle the portfolios
of privatised companies, and a demand for the free distribution of funds to
pensioners and civil servants in lieu of higher salaries blocked in 1991.
The former communist SLD party also argued that the privatisation scheme
should be treated as an experiment and brought in step-by-step, after the
management skills of the foreign-managed investment funds set up by the
scheme had been tested.
The government has responded by proposing that the shares of the first 200
companies be placed in a separate fund to be distributed free to pensioners
and state employees. But the government decided not to give in to the
anti-foreign investment manager sentiments of right-wing opponents, which
include a handful of rebels from the National Christian Union (ZChN) who
voted against the government of which they are coalition members.
The liberal democratic congress, Mr Lewandowski's own party, has threatened
to leave the government if the revised plan fails to win a parliamentary
majority. This effectively turns today's expected parliamentary vote into
one of confidence in the government.
A government defeat could have led either to early elections, unwanted by
most parties, or a reshuffle of the government coalition led by Ms Hanna
Suchocka.
The potential for a period of political instability, triggered by the
privatisation issue, has been increased by President Lech Walesa's decision
to put forward his own privatisation proposal. He remains dogged by his 1991
pre-election pledge that privatisation would leave Poles 100m zlotys
(Dollars 10,000) richer.
The president re-entered the fray last week. He gave his blessing to a new
political movement, the so-called non-party forum for reform. This is linked
to the siec (network), which is based on 260 Solidarity organisations in the
country's big factories and is widely perceived as a political platform for
Mr Walesa himself.
The meeting which set up the forum at Zdzieszowice, a coke works near
Gorazdze, called on the government to drop a mass-privatisation programme
'which treats workers as objects'. In its place, the meeting suggested,
Poles should be granted low-interest investment vouchers worth up to 300m
zlotys. The vouchers could only be used to buy state property and would be
essentially loans which would have to be repaid within 20 years.
Mr Walesa told Mr Lewandowski that he saw the investment grant idea as
complementary to the mass-privatisation scheme.
But the privatisation ministry fears that launch of the alternative plan now
could erode the government's majority in the vote on the scheme.

FT  03 APR 93 / German employers' high wage offers may hearten strikers

<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS in eastern Germany are offering temporary wage increases as high
as 26 per cent, in defiance of recommendations of a 9 per cent rise by the
national steel and engineering employers' associations.
The pay rises, which may apply only to April pay packets, are likely to
encourage IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, to continue with a wave of
warning strikes throughout eastern Germany's steel, electrical and metal
industry.
The strikes, called on Thursday, are in protest against the decision by
Gesamtmetall, the electrical and metal employers' association, and
Arbeitgeber-verband Stahl, the steel employers' association, to break
contracts agreed in March 1991 with IG Metall.
The contracts were designed to bring eastern German wages up to western
German levels by April 1994.
The eastern German metal and electrical sectors were due for a pay increase
of 26 per cent on April 1 and the steel sector a 21 per cent rise.
But the employers said they could not afford the increases in view of low
productivity in eastern Germany and the recession in western Germany.
The temporary offer by Opel, Volkswagen, and Daimler, which have plants or
suppliers in eastern Germany, is probably aimed at preventing further
stoppages.
Yesterday, IG Metall described the Volkswagen pay offer as a 'pseudo-pay
increase'.
In other sectors of the economy, KWO Kabel, owned by BICC, the British-based
cable manufacturer, has already offered an annual pay increase of 15 per
cent.
Lufthansa, the German national airline, is negotiating to bring the wages of
its 500 eastern German employees to 82 per cent of western German levels.
IG Metall officials yesterday said they would continue with the strikes.
'Eastern German fringe benefits are far lower than their western German
counterparts,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin.
A steel worker in eastern Germany earns DM1,762 (Pounds 722) a month before
tax, works a 40-hour week and has 24 days' annual holiday.
In contrast, from April 1, a western German steel worker of the same rank,
earns DM2,694 a month, works a 36-hour week and has 30 days of annual leave.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S three main trade union federations yesterday staged a staggered,
four-hour general strike, calling on the government to act urgently against
rising unemployment.
The strike came as the lira fell for the second time this week below the
level of 1,000 to the D-Mark, before recovering to L998. The currency's
weakness reflected market anxieties over the deadlock in efforts by Italian
politicians to agree on a way to find a stronger government.
The strike, which mainly affected public sector services and the civil
service, was accompanied by a series of demonstrations in the main cities.
Scuffles broke out in Turin and Naples, but the violence was less than
during the last such strike in November.
This was the 11th general strike in 12 years but yesterday rain reduced the
number of protesters on the streets. The protest against unemployment, now
reaching nearly 11 per cent of the labour force, was overshadowed by the
government crisis and the plight of the lira. But union leaders insisted
yesterday that the workers were likely to be those most prejudiced by the
government's faltering and the currency's decline.
The ruling Christian Democrats, dominant partners in the four-party
coalition headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, have come out strongly against the
idea of 'an institutional solution' to the political crisis. This hinged on
suggestions by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that a non-partisan figure,
such as the leader of either the senate or the chamber of deputies, assume
the leadership of an interim government after the referendums due on April
18, with the specific task of supervising electoral reform.
The Christian Democrats have been put onto the defensive, both by the
defection this week of the reformist Mr Mario Segni, and by the news that
Palermo magistrates were investigating the veteran Christian Democrat
politician Mr Giulio Andreotti, for alleged links with the mafia. The party
fears an 'institutional' government would annul its traditional influence.
The Christian Democrats are also hostile to the other main proposition -
accepting into the government representatives of the former communists, the
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The latter, for its part, is saying it
will only join the government if it contains people wholly untainted by
corruption scandals.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN crews on reconnaissance aircraft above the Adriatic Sea will not be
able to participate in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over former
Yugoslavia, pending a ruling by the German federal constitutional court.
It will rule on an appeal yesterday by the liberal Free Democrat party
(FDP), junior partner in the German coalition government, against a cabinet
decision to let crews stay on board Awacs aircraft.
The court will meet on Monday to study the appeal but has not said when a
ruling can be expected.
In a special cabinet session, ministers of the Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), voted that
German crews on Awacs could take part in Nato missions implementing the
no-fly zone over Bosnia.
However, the decision was immediately challenged by the FDP, which is asking
the court to consider whether German crews' involvement in enforcing the
no-fly zone is constitutional.
The coalition members have been clashing over interpretation of the
constitution. The CDU/CSU says that article 24 allows German troops to fight
in a Nato context.
But the FDP, as well as the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), say the
constitution prevents German military involvement outside Nato territory.
The SDP yesterday also filed an appeal on the question to the constitutional
court.
Awacs aircraft are conducting surveillance above the Adriatic and would tell
Nato's other forces how the no-fly zone is being enforced. A third of Awacs
crews are German.
Pending a court ruling, these crews would be asked to leave the Awacs if
Nato were to implement the no-fly zone. They would, however, be allowed to
prepare the aircraft.
CDU officials said they were hoping the court would rule in favour of the
cabinet decision in a couple of days.
If the court does not rule in favour, though, the matter would have to be
referred to parliament.
So far, the opposition SPD has refused to vote for constitutional changes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CLOUD of acid fumes leaked from the main plant at Hoechst yesterday, the
ninth time in five weeks the German chemical company has suffered a toxic
mishap, AP reports from Frankfurt.
Fumes from the acid apparently escaped over a neighboring residential area,
said Frankfurt police spokesman Manfred Feist. Residents were warned to stay
indoors.
Hoechst spokesman Mr Hartmut Hennen confirmed the accident but said it was
unclear how much toxic material leaked from the plant or how it happened.
He said the gas consisted of a concentrated form of sulphuric acid that is
irritating to the eyes and throat.
Hoechst is one of the world's biggest chemical, textile and pharmaceutical
companies, with production facilities in more than 60 countries and exports
to 170.
The company's main Frankfurt operations had a spotless safety record for
years until February 22, when a cloud of toxic chemicals leaked over the
city.
Seven other accidents quickly followed, including a methanol tank explosion
that killed a worker last month and seriously injured another.
Hoechst's string of mishaps have spurred calls in Germany for closer
monitoring of environmental safeguards at private industries.

FT  03 APR 93 / Interest rate cut as Belgium emerges from political crisis
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN central bank yesterday marked the end of the country's
short-lived government crisis by cutting its central interest rate from 8.2
per cent to the pre-crisis level of 8 per cent.
The centre-left coalition had won a vote of confidence from parliament in
the early hours of yesterday morning.
On Tuesday, the King of Belgium formally turned down the government's
week-old resignation offer after Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, had
persuaded the four coalition parties to agree a package of budget measures.
These should help bring Belgium's budget deficit in line with the Maastricht
criteria for European economic and monetary union by 1996.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, central bank governor, dismissed the crisis yesterday
as a hiccough in the country's programme for economic convergence with other
EC members.
The deficit stood at 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product last year,
compared with a target of 3 per cent by 1996, but BFr113bn (Pounds 2.26bn)
of austerity measures should help bring it down to 4.7 per cent by the end
of next year.
Mr Verplaetse said currency speculators who concentrated on the country's
public-sector finances had ignored the fact that Belgium's current account
had shown a healthy surplus since 1986, unlike those of many of its 11
partners in the EC.
During the crisis, Belgium's central rate was raised from 8 per cent to 8.5
per cent to help protect the Belgian franc.
It was cut to 8.2 per cent on Wednesday. The end-of-day rate was also cut
yesterday - from 9.2 per cent to 9 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday proposed direct
negotiations between the three warring factions in Bosnia as a way to break
the impasse in the Bosnian peace talks.
In a speech to the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament in Bileca, called to
decide whether to accept the international mediators' peace plan, Mr
Karadzic poured scorn on the proposed map dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into
10 semi-autonomous provinces.
The plan, drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and already endorsed by
the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, would confine Serbs 'to live in islands
surrounded by enemies,' he said. 'Accepting the maps, just as they are now,
would amount to unprecedented ethnic cleansing.'
Yet it is the Serb forces, who currently occupy 70 per cent of Bosnian
territory, who have been accused by the international community of killing
or expelling hundreds of thousands of Moslems from their homes.
At the same time, Mr Karadzic did not minimise the probable consequences of
a negative vote by the Bosnian Serb parliament on the Vance-Owen plan. He
warned it was likely to lead to stepped up sanctions, arming the outgunned
Moslem forces or even foreign military intervention.
In a move to put pressure on the Serbs to sign the plan, the United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday approved a resolution allowing Nato war planes
to shoot down aircraft flouting a five-month-old ban on flights in Bosnian
airspace.
Nato permanent representatives agreed yesterday in Brussels to send US,
British, French and Dutch fighters to enforce the no-fly zone. Mr Manfred
Worner, the Nato secretary-general said the plans to send the aircraft would
be ready less than two weeks from now.
Mr Karadzic said the UN resolution would only increase opposition to the
peace plan. But he nevertheless warned the 69 deputies of the parliament not
to delude themselves that the international community would fail to carry
out its threats.
In an attempt to soften his hardline approach, the Bosnian Serb leader said
the map boundaries proposed by the mediators were 70-80 per cent acceptable.
Direct talks between the warring parties could reduce the disputed territory
to 10 per cent and it was not worth 'killing each other' over such a small
area.
Though there appears to be little prospect of the parliament endorsing the
map as it stands, deputies may accept a proposal by Mr Vitaly Churkin,
Russia's special envoy to the peace talks, who has suggested the Bosnian
Serbs sign the uncontested part of the map and negotiate the rest.
Mr Churkin's compromise proposal has reportedly been approved by Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, Serbia's president, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump
Yugoslav federation, Russian sources said.
Meanwhile, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Norwegian Foreign Minister,
announced in Oslo he had agreed to take over from Mr Vance as the UN peace
mediator on the former Yugoslavia, joining Lord Owen, the European
Community's representative.

confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's privatisation minister, yesterday narrowly
survived an opposition vote of no confidence which, if successful, would
have led to the collapse of Ms Hanna Suchocka's seven-party coalition
government.
The vote came as the government launched the first reading of its modified
mass-privatisation proposals whose progress depends on the votes of the
58-strong former communist SLD group. Its abstention in the no confidence
vote against Mr Lewandowski allowed him to scrape home by 175:147, with 51
abstentions.
The SLD has been placed in this strategic position by a rebellion of the
right-wing Christian nationalist ZChN party, a government coalition member.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian cultural establishment, reeling from accusations of financial
mismanagement and alleged corruption, is set for a further blow with the
likely imposition of a special administrator at Milan's La Scala opera
house.
The threat follows the decision by a regional appeals court in the province
of Lombardy to accept a claim by an splinter union group that the July 1990
appointment of Mr Carlo Fontana, La Scala's new superintendant, to a
four-year term, was illegal.
The case is the latest round in a running battle between Milan's famous
theatre and various dissident workers, who have taken a variety of legal
steps against its management.
The latest twist comes at a particularly sensitive time for La Scala, and
for Italy's arts world in general. La Scala has suffered this season from
critical attacks on Luciano Pavarotti, the tenor whose first-night
performance in Verdi's opera Don Carlos was given a less than rapturous
reception by many in the sophisticated audience.
Subsequent performances went well but Pavarotti's relationship with the
opera house has grown more strained since his last-minute decision to pull
out of performances in I Pagliacci, which opened this week. Other leading
Italian opera houses have also been no strangers to financial or management
disputes lately.

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, the controversial director-general of the
World Health Organisation, has again been put into question by revelations
yesterday of financial irregularities involving payments to executive board
members.
In January, Dr Nakajima, a Japanese, was re-nominated by an 18-13 majority
of the 31-strong board to serve a further five-year term, amid allegations
of vote-rigging.
The renomination, which was opposed by the US and the European Community, is
subject to confirmation by the WHO's 183 members at the World Health
Assembly next month.
This confirmation, previously assumed to be a formality, must now be in
doubt following yesterday's release of a report confirming irregular
payments by WHO's external auditor, Britain's Comptroller and Auditor
General, Sir John Bourn.
Dr Nakajima is bound to come under strong pressure from western governments
to withdraw, in order to avoid adamaging row in May.
A spokesman for the US mission in Geneva said Dr Nakajima had mentioned the
option of resigning in a private meeting on March 29 with Mr James Sarn, a
senior official in the US Health Department.
While the auditor's report imputes no blame to Dr Nakajima personally, it
details five dubious contracts in the second half of 1992. All involved
Japanese funds and executive board members, and all were approved by Dr Yugi
Kawaguchi, a fellow Japanese and Nakajima protege who is director of
planning, co-ordination and co-operation.
Of the five contracts, totalling Dollars 215,000, only one - though by the
far the biggest at Dollars 150,000 - was found to breach existing WHO
procedures. The others, all relating to travel expenses, highlighted
shortcomings in WHO financial controls.
A WHO statement said Dr Nakajima had noted 'with satisfaction' that no fraud
had been uncovered and would 'soon' be announcing 'several organisational
changes and administrative measures, including personnel actions'.
Mr Denis Aitken, WHO's assistant director-general for administration, said
yesterday the report revealed 'lapses, shortcomings and deficiencies' for
which 'we all take responsibility'.
The worst case involved a Dollars 150,000 research grant to a Philippine
institution run by an executive board member for a project of questionable
value.

FT  03 APR 93 / One-day strike provokes tough British Coal reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL reacted strongly to yesterday's one-day strike by miners and
transport workers by stopping the 'check-off' system, under which employers
deduct union dues from pay, at pits which had joined the strike.
The company also revealed it had decided to defer a payment of Pounds 109m
into the staff pension fund, which has a Pounds 1bn surplus.
BACM, the mine managers union, said the Pounds 109m payment could not be
stopped unilaterally and it would consider legal action against the move.
However, the main coal, rail and bus unions hailed the strike as a 'success'
in their fight against job losses, though most of Britain, outside London,
worked normally.
The protests affected almost the entire rail network, 38 out of 50 pits and
some London bus services. Coal and rail unions threatened further action.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, described the strike as 'perfectly
pointless'.
The RMT rail union will meet in the next few days to decide whether to take
further action, although it has agreed to meet British Rail for talks some
time next week.
ASLEF, the train drivers union, which did not take part in yesterday's
action, is already balloting its members on industrial action.
BR officials warned privately that any further one-day strikes would provoke
a much firmer reaction. That could include recourse to the law on the
grounds that the strike was 'secondary action' taken on behalf of
mineworkers. Other possibilities include following British Coal by
withdrawing the check-off service. This would would be likely to hit RMT
finances and membership.
'If we do nothing again the British Rail management will be discredited in
the run-up to privatisation,' said one official.
Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, said it had
been an 'extremely successful' day. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee
relations director, said such action would consign the UK coal industry to
history.
Most collieries in Nottinghamshire, dominated by the breakaway Union of
Democratic Mineworkers, worked normally. BR shut down almost totally apart
from a few driver-only trains.

The decision sent the company's share price sharply lower on Wall Street and
contributed to a 2 per cent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The
stock market was also upset by an unexpected fall in US employment and a
drop in bond prices.
The cut - possibly by as much as 20 per cent - in the price of America's
most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks is
restricted to the US.
It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's
international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the
European Community market.
A packet of Marlboro costs on average Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of
discount cigarettes at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip
Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, narrowing the
gap between the brand and the cheapest pack of discount cigarettes from
around Dollars 1.06 to 66 cents.
On the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed 68.63 lower at 3,370.81, Philip Morris stock fell more than 20 per
cent, or Dollars 15 1/4 , to Dollars 49 3/8 . This erased about Dollars
13.5bn from the group's stock market valuation.
RJR Nabisco dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 and American Brands fell
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 30. In London, BAT's price tumbled 71p to 928p on
exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared the move could dent the UK
group's profits.
Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an
estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US
tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its
new strategy. Some analysts cut their 1993 earnings forecasts for the group
from around Dollars 6.45 a share to around Dollars 5 a share.
Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US
tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain
fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market
share.
The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dipped
to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991
as smokers switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with
no brand image.
These discount cigarettes, substantially less profitable for the
manufacturers, have seen their share of the US market grow from about 19 per
cent in 1990, to about 36 per cent last year.

FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton joins Thorp nuclear plant row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has stepped into the controversy over the Pounds
2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in a move which could
further delay the start of its operations.
Mr Clinton has told seven congressmen he will raise the issue with the
British government after his administration has looked into ways of
combating nuclear proliferation.
In a letter to the president on February 23, just days before his first
meeting with Mr John Major, the congressmen warned Mr Clinton that plutonium
produced at Thorp would add to the world's stockpile and increase the risk
of the spread of nuclear weapons.
The congressmen, led by Mr Pete Stark of California, also wrote to Mr Major
before his visit, but have not yet had a reply. Their letter urged that 'a
decision by the UK against commissioning the Thorp plant would be a
significant contribution to efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear
weapons'.
The questions about the reprocessing plant took Mr Major by surprise on his
US visit and he called for hurried briefings from London.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said four days ago that
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons was one of the administration's top
concerns when considering foreign aid requests. Mr Christopher's comments
followed news that North Korea had flouted a United Nations deadline for
inspection of its nuclear facilities.
However, US administration officials cautioned that the Thorp plant was not
high on their list of priorities, and doubted that it would become a
significant bilateral issue between the US and the UK.
The UK government is embroiled in three separate inquiries into whether the
plant should begin operating. President Clinton's interest in the
destination of plutonium produced by Thorp will complicate the British
government's task and could worry Thorp's foreign customers.
In a reply to the congressmen, President Clinton said that once the US had
concluded its review, 'we will surely wish to consult with the British on
appropriate steps we could take together to combat nuclear proliferation'.
Downing Street declined to comment last night on the possibility of US
intervention in British nuclear policy.
British Nuclear Fuels, which has built Thorp, said 'plutonium which Thorp
will reclaim cannot be converted into weapons grade material without
substantial expertise and equipment'.

FT  03 APR 93 / Councils may lose control over grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is planning to strip local councils of their responsibility
for administering mandatory student grants and fees.
Under the new scheme, parents and students would have to apply for grants to
a centralised agency. This agency could be combined with the Student Loans
Company, which runs the government loans system introduced in 1990 to
supplement student maintenance grants.
Over the longer term, some ministers believe the work should be carried out
by the private sector, and combining the administration of student loans and
grants would be the first step. Transferring the task to the private sector
could be achieved by privatising the loans company.
Councils could also lose responsibility for awarding discretionary student
grants, which might be turned into scholarships to be awarded by the
colleges themselves.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, hopes to legislate in the next
parliamentary session, but his bill has not been given a firm place in the
programme. The cabinet, which will decide soon after Easter what bills
should proceed in autumn, wants a legislative programme to unite Tory
backbenchers.
Mr Patten's proposals are strongly backed by the Treasury, which believes
that a centralised agency would provide better value for money.
This decision to remove a further task from local authorities is likely to
undermine the new spirit of co-operation between central and local
government which Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has been seeking
to promote.
Although councils act only in processing government money under the present
arrangements for mandatory student grants, the move may be seen as a further
blow to the status and role of local authorities.

FT  03 APR 93 / One-day strike provokes tough British Coal reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of Britain, outside London, worked normally yesterday in spite of the
one-day strike which affected almost the entire rail system, 38 out of 50
coal mines and some London buses.
British Coal reacted by announcing that the 'check-off' system, by which
union dues are deducted from pay by employers, would be stopped immediately
at those pits which had joined the strike.
Separately, the company revealed that it had decided to defer a payment of
Pounds 109m into the staff pension fund which has a Pounds 1bn surplus.
BACM, the mine managers union, said the Pounds 109m payment could not be
stopped unilaterally and it would consider legal action against the move.
The main coal, rail and bus unions hailed the strike as a 'success' in their
fight against job losses. Coal and rail unions threatened further action. Mr
John Major, the prime minister, described the strike as 'perfectly
pointless'.
The RMT rail union will meet in the next few days to decide whether to take
further action, although it has agreed to meet British Rail for talks next
week.
ASLEF, the train drivers union, which did not take part in yesterday's
action, is already balloting its members on industrial action.
British Rail officials warned privately that any further one-day strikes
would provoke a much firmer reaction. That could include recourse to the law
on the grounds that the strike was 'secondary action' taken on behalf of
mineworkers. Other possibilities include following British Coal by
withdrawing the check-off service. This would would be likely to hit RMT
finances and membership.
'If we do nothing again the British Rail management will be discredited in
the run-up to privatisation,' said one official.
Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, said it had
been an 'extremely successful' day. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee
relations director, said such action would consign the UK coal industry to
history.
Most collieries in Nottinghamshire, dominated by the breakaway Union of
Democratic Mineworkers, worked normally. BR shut down almost totally apart
from a few driver-only trains. Checking out from check-off, Page 6

FT  03 APR 93 / Marlboro cut points to price war in US
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS declared an all-out price war in the US tobacco industry
yesterday by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand to protect its market
share from the rise of discount brands.
The cut in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the
world's most valuable trademarks reductions is restricted to the US market.
It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's
international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the
European Community cigarette market.
A packet of Marlboro costs on average around Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that
of discount cigarettes selling at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to
Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, or
nearly 20 per cent, although Philip Morris declined to spell out details.
The move sent the shares of tobacco companies plummeting in heavy trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. At lunchtime, Philip Morris was down 20 per
cent, or Dollars 13 1/4 , at Dollars 51 3/8 , while RJR Nabisco dripped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 and American Brands stood Dollars 3 3/8 lower
at Dollars 30 3/8 .
In London, BAT's share price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy
turnover as traders feared that the move could dent the UK group's profits.
Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an
estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US
tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its
new strategy.
Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US
tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain
fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market
share.
The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dropped
to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991
as smokers have switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties
with no brand image.
Philip Morris, which belatedly entered the discount market two years ago,
has become a big player in the sector, rivalling RJR Reynolds for market
leadership.
Philip Morris said its shift in Marlboro strategy was designed to 'grow
market share rather than pursue rapid income growth rates which might erode
our leading market place position.' Lex, Page 26 Wall Street, Page 23 London

THE Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public pension plan's investment arm, is
negotiating control of Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor, with
the two other large shareholders in the foods group.
The Caisse, which holds 17 per cent of Univa, last month declined a joint
CDollars 11 a share bid worth CDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 842m) from
Blackstone, the New York investment group, and Mr Bertin Nadeau, Montreal
entrepreneur.
Mr Nadeau owns 26 per cent of Univa and the Sobey family, of Nova Scotia, 25
per cent. As a result of the Caisse's refusal, Blackstone withdrew the bid.
Jean Claude Delorme, chairman, said the Caisse exercised its rights as a
long-term shareholder and believed its Univa investment would grow
substantially.

the company was privatised last summer.
Pre-tax losses fell to Rs78m from Rs159m on turnover 14 per cent lower at

Suzuki produces Pakistan's smallest and most popular car. The business

FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of Thames Television to the dealing screens produced wild price
swings as traders struggled to estimate a takeover price and to come to
terms with provisions that were worse than feared.
The shares shot up 32 earlier this week on reports that Pearson, the media,
banking and industrial conglomerate, was in talks with Thorn EMI, parent of
Thames. Subsequently, trading in the shares was suspended at 221p.
When dealing began again today the shares opened at 155p as Thames announced
that it was passing the dividend because of provisions of between Pounds 35m
and Pounds 42m, relating to its US arm and losses in property.
There was also reassessment of earlier estimates that an offer from Pearson
would be worth 250p a share. However, analysts still feel Thames could
command 200p a share and by the close the stock had rallied to stand 33 off
at 188p. Turnover was very thin at only 100,000 shares.
Pearson added 2 at 412p while Thorn dipped 5 to 880p.
The market's reaction to Pilkington's Pounds 80m five-year bond issue was to
switch out of the ordinary shares and into the bond/warrant issue. Dealers
said the new issue meant that buyers of the bond could convert into the
ordinary shares at 120p a share. Pilkington slipped 9 1/2 to 115 1/2 p on
heavy turnover of 16m shares.
The suspension of Queens Moat Houses shares on Wednesday led to a worrying
time for the banks sector.
Barclays was said to have been the worst affected, the shares sliding 6 to
413p after hints in the market that the bank's exposure to the company could
run to around Pounds 165m.
Royal Bank of Scotland added 7 at 271p, still boosted by recent profits
upgrades.
Results from Next were well received and prompted analysts to upgrade
sharply. Analysts came away reassured that the company was not planning any
major acquisitions.
The shares responded by jumping 11 to 172p on large turnover of 12m.
Analysts returned from a two-day visit to Hazlewood Food reassured and the
shares rose 5 to 184p.
Mining group RTZ rose 7 to 703p on good demand for gold, higher copper
prices and the lingering effects of RTZ's increased scrip alternative to its
final dividend.
Gloom around construction equipment company BM Group, which announced a fall
in interim profits and a restructuring plan earlier this week, intensified,
causing a slide in the stock. The shares dived 13 to close at 18p, an
eight-year low, in heavy trading which saw turnover rise to 9.2m. British
Building &amp; Eng Appliances, in which BM has a majority stake that it has put
up for sale, eased 3 to 285p.
The market was cheered by improved results and an acquisition from
Spirax-Sarco and the shares improved 8 to 357p. TI Group added 6 at 305p on
news that German group Mannesman raised its holding to 7.7 per cent.
Talk of an impending order for Airbus aircraft boosted British Aerospace,
which holds a 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium. The shares
hardened 8 to 283p.
Speculation of further disposals lifted international trading group Lonrho
ahead of today's annual meeting. The shares gained 3 to 85p.
Shares in Vickers shed a penny to 129p after brokers Hoare Govett and
Cazenove placed the rump of the recent rights issue, which had a 92.6 per
cent take-up. The outstanding block of 2.4m was placed at 127p.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: E Europe farming machine sales
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOOM in the agricultural machinery market in eastern Germany is
beginning to tail off, according to Claas, Europe's biggest producer of
combine harvesters and self-propelled forage harvesters.
The family-owned company, based at Harsewinkel in northern Germany, says in
its annual report for the year ended September 30 that the decline of sales
to western European agricultural machinery markets is expected to continue
in the current year.
'There is still uncertainty about the impact of the Gatt negotiations,' it
says 'and this, along with the agricultural resolutions passed by the
European Community in spring 1992, is causing purchasers of agricultural
machinery to buy considerably less.'
Overall sales of combine harvesters in western Europe dropped by about 20
per cent in the financial year just ended.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: S Korea's four main shipbuilders
post higher profits and sales for 1992
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's four main shipbuilders posted higher profits and sales for
1992 due to increased ship prices and a reduction in labour disputes.
The shipbuilding division of Hyundai Heavy Industries reported a 31 per cent
increase in sales to Won1,820bn (Dollars 2.29bn), while it provided most of
the group's net profits of Won281.2bn, according to analysts.
For the second successive year, Hyundai Heavy Industries is the nation's
highest corporate tax payer with Won87.6bn.
The shipbuilding division of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery
achieved a 21 per cent rise in sales to Won908.2bn out of the company's
total turnover of Won1,550bn.
Group profits amounted to Won211.2bn last year after suffering total losses
of more than Won500bn in the late 1980s.
Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industrial registered a 44 per cent increase
in sales to Won540.3bn. The shipbuilding division is estimated to account
for Won60bn of the company's profits of Won94.5bn.
Hanjin Heavy Industrial had a 59 per cent jump in sales to Won263.5bn, while
it reported its first profit in a decade at Won19.6bn. It had a loss of
Won7.1bn in 1991.

<TEXT>
MIM, the Australian metals and coal producer, has acquired 30 per cent of
Mount Fort Constantine, a copper and gold mining exploration venture, for up
to ADollars 43m (USDollars 30m).
Mr Norman Fussell, managing director, said the company had bought the stake
from Hunter Resources, a small Australian mining group. The other 70 per
cent is owned by Western Mining, another leading Australian mining group.
The Mount Fort Constantine joint venture, which operates in north-west
Queensland, includes the highly-rated Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit,
which is subject to legal proceed-ings.
If Ernest Henry is ultimately included in the MIM deal, the purchase price
will be ADollars 43. If not, MIM will grant Hunter Resources a 2 per cent
gross royalty in mineral production as settlement.
Mr Fussell said MIM regards Ernest Henry as among Australia's most
prospective copper-gold areas.

<TEXT>
AXA, the French insurance company, is planning to make another Dollars 300m
capital injection in The Equitable, the large but troubled US life insurer,
it was announced late yesterday in New York.
Axa injected Dollars 1bn into the ailing insurance and financial services
group in 1991, receiving a 49 per cent stake in The Equitable when the US
group converted from mutual status to a shareholder-owned company last year.
Axa's new investment comes as part of a Dollars 600m fund-raising exercise
by The Equitable, designed to bolster the capital base of its life insurance
subsidiaries. The US insurer said that it planned to sell this amount of
convertible securities via a private placement. The nature of the
convertible securities was not specified, but The Equitable said they would
swap into about 25m shares of common stock after July 22 1994.
'Axa is expected to purchase 49 per cent of the convertible securities,'
said The Equitable. The remaining securities, it added, were expected to go
to institutional investors.

deal with BP
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SYNCORDIA, British Telecom's 18-month-old Atlanta-based subsidiary for
telecommunications network outsourcing, has won a contract from British
Petroleum. The oil company becomes Syncordia's fifth customer.
Syncordia will manage BP's voice, data, video and messaging services among
five sites in the UK and Stavanger, Norway. BP and Syncordia are also
negotiating to include additional sites.
Although the five-year contract's total value was not disclosed, Syncordia
said its first year was worth Dollars 12m.
BP said it believed the outsourcing arrangement would bring 'significant
operating and financial benefits'.
Last year, Syncordia began working with BP Chemicals, a unit of BP, managing
its communications network among 11 sites in seven European countries.
Syncordia, although it has been off to a slow start, aims to capture a
significant slice of the fast growing market for network outsourcing -
whereby companies contract out the management of their telecommunications
systems to specialists.
Competition in the global network outsourcing market, estimated to grow to
Dollars 4bn to Dollars 6bn by the mid-1990s, is increasingly tough, with
companies such as AT&amp;T, MCI and Unisource jockeying for market share with
BT.
For BT, Syncordia is a key element in its strategy to expand internationally
and become the world's leading supplier of telecommunications services.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: US cable TV industry hit by FCC
price move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, GEORGE GRAHAM and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in the leading US cable television companies fell sharply yesterday
when the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which
oversees the industry, took action which will lead to widespread cuts in the
price of cable services.
The FCC move stems from cable industry legislation, passed by Congress last
year, which imposes rate regulation for the first time in six years and
requires the commission to draft pricing guidelines, which would then be
implemented by local governments.
The commission yesterday set a price benchmark some 10 per cent below the
average price charged by the cable companies before congress passed the
regulation bill. Because many companies increased rates following passage of
the bill, the total cut could be as much as 15 per cent for some consumers.
Shares in cable companies fell by 5 per cent to 10 per cent following the
announcement. Tele-Communications, the industry leader, fell Dollars 2 to
Dollars 20 1/2 , Cablevision dipped 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Time-Warner
dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 and Comcast closed at Dollars 20 7/8 ,
down Dollars 2 1/2 .
Sprint, the US long-distance telecommunications group, said yesterday that
it expected to record after-tax charges against first-quarter earnings of
Dollars 550m-Dollars 575m, mainly because of accounting changes and costs
associated with its takeover of Centel, the Chicago-based local
telecommunications group, writes Martin Dickson.
The company said that it expected to lose 15,000 jobs after the takeover, up
from about 1,000 when the deal was announced last year.
Sprint said the merger was expected to produce minimum savings of Dollars
145m annually on a pre-tax basis within two years.
Anheuser-Busch, the largest beer manufacturer in the US, yesterday announced
a marketing and distribution agreement with Birra Peroni Industriale, the
leading Italian brewer, writes Nikki Tait.
The agreement is designed to push Anheuser's Budweiser brand in the Italian
market. Under the arrangement, Birra Peroni will be responsible for
distribution, while the US company will be primarily responsible for
marketing.

DRESDNER Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris of France, which last year
finalised terms for a co-operation agreement, have postponed their plans for
a share exchange until after BNP's forthcoming privatisation, write David
Waller in Frankfurt and Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Both Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner, and Mr Rene Thomas,
chairman of BNP, stressed that the co-operation agreement remained intact
and also reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the share swap, which
is intended to involve the two banks taking up to 10 per cent of each
others' equity. However, BNP said the exchange had been delayed until after
privatisation, as its valuation would be different as a private sector
company.
The proposed share swap is still subject to the approval of shareholders of
both banks and must also be approved by the European Commission competition
authorities.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wolseley buys Swedish group in Pounds 45m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSELEY, the building materials distributor, is further expanding into
Europe with the acquisition of Enertech Industries, the Swedish oil and gas
burner and boiler manufacturer.
Wolseley is paying SKr512.3m (Pounds 44.5m) for Enertech, a division of
Trelleborg, the Swedish conglomerate. The acquisition is being financed by
share placings at 565p to raise Pounds 62.2m.
In February last year Wolseley bought Brossette, France's largest plumbing
distributor, and remains keen to expand its European distribution network.
Yesterday's purchase marks the first overseas expansion of its smaller,
manufacturing arm which makes a range of specialist engineering and
agricultural products.
Mr Richard Ireland, finance director, said Enertech was complementary to
Wolseley's existing products. 'Our UK burner group (Nu-Way) was not really
operating in Europe but we now have a significant presence,' he said.
Enertech's burners are market leaders in Sweden and its domestic burners
have a large share of the UK market. Its domestic and commercial boilers
also have strong market shares in northern Europe.
Enertech also owns HRPC, which supplies domestic heating parts in the UK
through 36 branches. Mr Ireland said HRPC would be kept separate from the
Controls Centre chain, which mainly serves the commercial market.
Enertech employs more than 1,000 people and has factories in Sweden, Germany
and Belgium. In the year to December 31 it reported operating profits of
SKr80.4m on sales of SKr1.33bn.
Mr Ireland said the acquisition would only dilute earnings if Enertech
failed to match last year's profits. Results should be helped by cost
cutting put in place last year.
Under the placings, arranged by SG Warburg, Wolseley will issue 11m new
shares, equal to 4.6 per cent of its issued capital. The extra money raised
will be used to match Pounds 12.1m of Enertech borrowings which would
otherwise increase Wolseley's net borrowings and gearing level. Exchange
rate movements on overseas debt lifted Wolseley's net borrowings by more
than Pounds 60m to Pounds 122.6m at the year end, increasing gearing to 32
per cent.
The remainder of the cash raised, about Pounds 6m, would be used to pay for
a smaller acquisition which is under discussion.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hong Kong disposal for Faupel Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, has sold Oriental
Finzel to its management for HKDollars 1 and the sale of certain
intellectual property rights for HKDollars 60,000 (Pounds 5,000).
These amounts will be added to the repayment of an intercompany loan account
which will total HKDollars 449,044. This sum will be capitalised as zero
coupon preference shares in Finzel which will be redeemed at par in 12
monthly instalments.
Finzel, acquired by Faupel in 1990, is based in Hong Kong and trades in
electrical and electronic components.
The disposal will result in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 233,000 in
Faupel's accounts for the year to March 31 1993. There will also be a Pounds
637,000 charge for goodwill previously written off to reserves. Faupel said
it was unlikely to maintain profits for the year, but intends to recommend
an unchanged final dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Group has expanded into continental Europe via the acquisition of two
Netherlands-based textile companies for Fl 6.78m (Pounds 2.49m).
Further consideration, to a maximum Fl 2.8m, is dependent on profitability.
Initial consideration is satisfied by the issue of 613,628 new shares,
placed with institutions at 405p, apart from 29,727 retained by the vendors.
A further 386,372 are being issued to provide Pounds 1.43m net of additional
working capital.
The two companies, TIM Beheer and Itex Brummen, specialise in the transfer
printing of textiles and the merchanting of dyed and printed fabrics.
For the 1992 year TIM returned pre-tax profits of Fl 1.16m and had net
tangible assets of Fl 4.73m. Itex had net tangible assets of Fl 737,000 and
made pre-tax profits of Fl 725,000.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fairhaven to raise Pounds 24m via 40%
flotation of OGC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIRHAVEN International, the specialist oil contractor, yesterday announced
plans to raise more than Pounds 24m by floating off part of its rapidly
growing Aberdeen-based offshore business.
The company said it planned to invest part of the proceeds of the sale of 40
per cent of OGC International in its US onshore construction business. The
US business would then be able to pay off its Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) debt
owed to OGC, leaving Fairhaven with a cash rich balance sheet.
Although Mr James Davidson, chairman of Fairhaven, was unable to say exactly
how much would be raised, it was expected that OGC would have a market
capitalisation in excess of Fairhaven's own Pounds 60m.
The company, valued in Fairhaven's books at about Dollars 34m, would seek a
listing in May.
The decision to float off part of OGC, which reported profits of Pounds
10.5m (Pounds 7.2m) on sales of Pounds 226.5m (Pounds 110m) for the year to
December 31, was based on the mature and international nature of the
business, Mr Davidson said.
There were also strong advance corporation tax reasons for floating OGC. As
Fairhaven is a Bermuda-registered company, Mr Davidson said, the dividends
were subject to double taxation - once paid by the company and again by UK
investors.
Mr Davidson denied that Fairhaven was floating off the most profitable part
of the business. The US operation would benefit from further investment.
'What interests us greatly are the prospects in natural gas,' he said. He
did not expect profits to be depressed by this move.
Eventually, Fairhaven might float off part of the US operation and invest in
something else. 'In a way, Fairhaven is becoming an investment vehicle,' Mr
Davidson said.
The announcement was made as Fairhaven reported a sharp jump in pre-tax
profits from Dollars 14.1m to Dollars 18.1m for the year to December 31 on
sales ahead 70 per cent to Dollars 524.4m.
The rise in profits was fuelled by strong orders in the North Sea and were
struck after charging Dollars 2.8m for the costs of a dispute over defective
print materials involving the company's 3D camera investment. Although a
court had ruled in favour of Fairhaven, the process had gone to appeal. Mr
Davidson said he decided to write off the costs, without including the
potential award.
The dividend is doubled to 0.8 cents, while earnings advanced from 4.01
cents to 4.39 cents.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thames TV shares fall 33p on provision news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION, the independent production company, yesterday announced
it was making provisions totalling between Pounds 35m and Pounds 42m on
property and on Reeves, its US production arm.
The provisions were considerably larger than the City expected and the
shares fell 33p to 188p following their relisting yesterday.
The shares had been suspended partly because of the pending announcement on
provisions and partly because of a report in the Financial Times that
Pearson, the publishing, banking and oil services group which owns the FT,
was in exploratory talks to buy Thorn EMI's near-60 per cent stake in
Thames.
Yesterday Thames confirmed that it had been informed by Thorn that it was in
talks with Pearson, but that they were at a preliminary stage.
The provisions will be taken as extraordinary items. The company said that
pre-tax profits for 1992 were expected to be about Pounds 45m in line with
City expectations. A formal results announcement is expected in three weeks.
As a result of the provisions, mainly flowing from revaluations of central
London property and the Reeves library of programmes, there will be an
attributable loss.
Thames admitted that the interim dividend paid in September was a technical
breach of the Companies Act because full interim accounts had not been
submitted at the time. It was considering how to address the problem.
Early action by Pearson is not expected and there may now be a pause to see
how the Thames share price settles down following yesterday's disclosure. If
Pearson does decide to bid for Thorn's holding it will have to make a
general offer for all the shares of Thames.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: German deal as Whatman rises 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATMAN yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in profits for 1992 and
announced it would take control of a German company specialising in
molecular biology for up to DM9.6m (Pounds 4.06m).
The specialist paper and filtration equipment maker is buying 60 per cent of
Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik and has an option to increase its stake to
80 per cent after three years.
It will pay for the stake through the issue of about 750,000 new shares.
Whatman's pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.21m) in the year
to December 31, helped by strong sales growth. At the interim stage, profits
were 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 4.5m.
Turnover increased 26 per cent to Pounds 62.6m, helped by currency factors.
Excluding these factors, the company said margins remained steady. Trading
profits increased 5 per cent to Pounds 10.1m.
Earnings increased 9 per cent to 29.08p (26.66p). The company said it would
increase its dividend in line with earnings, and proposed a final dividend
of 6.4p to make a total of 9.5p (8.7p).

FT  02 APR 93 / Medeva in Pounds 94m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the fast-growing pharmaceuticals company, yesterday launched its
fourth cash call since 1990 and announced it was raising Pounds 94.4m to
make its maiden acquisition in Germany and wipe out net borrowings.
Medeva is buying Ribosepharm, a private company specialising in cancer
treatment products, for DM125.5m (Pounds 52.3m).
The rest of the money raised will be used to repay borrowings, which stood
at Pounds 38.6m at March 12. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, said
cutting borrowings would allow Medeva to continue its acquisition-led
growth.
'By eliminating borrowings we probably have the ability to do up to Pounds
100m of acquisitions in the next 12 to 18 months without referring back to
shareholders, assuming the opportunities come up,' he said.
The one-for-four rights of 54m new shares at 180p a share was underwritten
by Lazard Brothers. The acquisition was well received by the stock market
and Medeva's shares gained 3p to 230p.
Ribosepharm was founded in 1984 and last year made pre-tax profits of DM9.9m
on sales of DM30.3m.
Medeva has been keen to enter Germany, the world's third largest
pharmaceuticals market, and the purchase also gives the company a new
product line similar to its severe pain management products.
The German company's products, which mainly reduce the side effects of toxic
cancer treatments, could also be sold through Medeva's UK and US sales
forces.
Two months ago, Medeva made its first acquisition in Europe, Institut de
Recherche Corbiere, a French distributor of ethical products for Pounds
11.6m.
IRC markets products to GPs while Ribosepharm has a sales force of 11
marketing to cancer specialists in Germany and Austria. Its largest product,
Ribofolin, accounted for about 60 per cent of last year's sales.
The purchase price of DM125.5m included DM18.5 in existing shareholders'
loans, a DM14.1m tax liability which will arise upon completion and a bonus
of DM2m to the group's owner which depends on sales.
Medeva has also agreed to DM2m as bonuses to senior staff.

FT  02 APR 93 / Luggage locker row goes to EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAANND SYSTEMS, a company based in Livingston near Edinburgh, has complained
to the European Commission about alleged predatory pricing by the French
company Mors in the battle for orders for left-luggage lockers in railway
stations.
Raannd has complained to the commission that Mors won a contract in December
to supply lockers at Waverley station in Edinburgh, and at Queens Street and
Central stations in Glasgow, by setting prices in a predatory manner. Raannd
had offered to supply 700 lockers for about Pounds 400,000, and says Mors
undercut this by 40 per cent.
It is also complaining that it was undercut by Mors last August on an order
from British Rail for 700 lockers at Waterloo International station in
London.
The complaint came to light as ScotRail, BR's Scottish division, confirmed
that automated luggage lockers installed by Mors at Edinburgh Waverley were
being adapted after it was found they would only accept French and Belgian
coins. The problem with the coins was triggering the lockers' alarm system.
Mors has about 75 per cent of the European locker market and Raannd alleges
that Mors has violated article 86 of the Treaty of Rome which covers abuse
of market power.
Raannd says the commission has begun an investigation of the matter.
The company is also 'in dialogue' with Mors over alleged infringements of
Raannd's patents on its lockers.
Dr Gordon Rankine, Raannd's managing director, said that after complaining
to Sir Bob Reid, chairman of BR, he was advised the procedures for the bid
had been implemented correctly.
Nobody at Mors was available for comment yesterday.

<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Ansaldo Gie, the Italian engineering group which is part
of the Iri state holding company, has won the contract to build a new
turnkey power station in northern Greece.
The L550bn (Pounds 229m) deal is for the Aghios Dimitrios 5 plant at Kozani,
about 100 miles from Salonika.
The new coal-fired station will produce 350MW of electricity and 70MW in
heat as part of a linked, long-distance heating project. The new plant,
probably to be financed via an international bond issue by Greece's Public
Power corporation, should be ready in four years.
Ansaldo's share, worth over L300bn, involves turbines, generators and
related control equipment. Austria's Wagner Biro will furnish the boilers
and Aegek of Greece will be responsible for construction.
Ansaldo Gie and Siemens of Germany have won a contract worth over L200bn for
electricity generating equipment to complete one of the world's biggest
hydro-electric power stations.
Each company will supply five water turbines, generating a total of 1,600MW,
for the Yacireta plant on the Parana river separating Argentina and
Paraguay. The new units complete a project, devised in the 1960s, which will
generate 3,100MW of electricity via 20 water turbines.

The new units complete a project, devised in the 1960s, which will generate

Italtel, the Italian state-controlled telephone equipment group, has won an
order worth L100bn to supply new digital telephone exchanges serving 400,000
new lines in Argentina.
The contract, covering a four-year period, is with Telecom Argentina, the
telecoms operator for the northern part of the country.
The new Lnea UT exchanges will be used to extend capacity in Buenos Aires
and the main urban centres in the northern area, including Cordoba and
Rosario.
The first 58,000 lines are to be installed by the end of this year, with the
remainder completed by the end of 1996. The contract is part of a programme
to modernise and expand telephone services in northern Argentina.

<TEXT>
ROYALE BELGE, the Belgian insurer, yesterday announced that its net
consolidated profits rose 3.6 per cent last year to BFr4.4bn (Dollars
129.4m) from BFr4.2bn, in spite of economic and tax uncertainties.
Turnover at the group, nearly 50 per cent of which is controlled by UAP, the
French insurer, rose 5.1 per cent to BFr97.2bn. The company is proposing an
increase in its net dividend to BFr147 per share from BFr140.
The group announced it had finished restructuring itself into two
operations, one working with independent brokers, the other with networks of
salaried agents.
Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, announced a return to profit before
extraordinary charges, and reduced losses after tax and extraordinary
charges.
The group lost BFr2.65bn after tax and extraordinary items in 1992, compared
with a loss of BFr4.8bn in 1991.
Before extraordinary charges of BFr2.92bn against BFr3.73bn, mainly relating
to the group's review of all balance sheet items, the company was narrowly
profitable, recording current profit of BFr764m, compared with losses of
BFr693m in 1991.
Union Miniere is one of the main holdings of Societe Generale de Belgique,
the country's largest holding company. La Generale, which announces its 1992
results next week, owns just over 82 per cent of the metals group.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Quebec appears to be inching towards a partial relaxation
of its highly contentious French-only language law.
The conseil de la langue francaise, a government advisory body, has
recommended that small businesses in the province be allowed to put up
bilingual signs outside their premises.
But the conseil rejected other concessions, such as relaxing the requirement
that children of immigrants attend French-language schools.
Arcane though it may seem to outsiders, the language law, known as Bill 101,
is among the most divisive political issues in Quebec.
About 83 per cent of the province's population is French-speaking, and the
position of French culture has seldom been more secure. Recent opinion polls
indicate that a majority of Quebecois are now willing to accept some
dilution of the strict French-only requirements of Bill 101.
Many nationalists are concerned, however, by the longer-term pressures to
anglicise coming from the rest of North America and the rising tide of
non-French speaking immigrants to the province.
The government must set a new language policy before the end of this year.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (14): A whiff of corruption - The Filesa
Case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not Italy. But it is starting to smell that way. Political corruption
has become a burning issue in Spain.
Later this month a Madrid judge is likely to ask parliament to lift the
immunity on a congressman and a senator who are allegedly linked to a
judicial investigation into illicit funding of the governing Socialist
party.
The judge's probe, known as the Filesa case after a Barcelona-based group of
consultancy companies that allegedly bankrolled the government's 1989
general electoral campaign, has an identifiable Italian whiff about it.
Tax inspectors working for Judge Mariano Barbero last month compiled a
report that itemised a list of payments, totalling Pta1bn (Dollars 8.4m),
that the Filesa group received from leading domestic banks and companies in
return for consultancy reports and also a list of subsequent payments that
the group made to the Socialist party to cover its electoral expenses.
The report is an explosive one because it alleges that Filesa, which was
controlled by Mr Carlos Navarro, a congressman and former treasurer of the
Socialist parliamentary party, and by Sen Jose Maria Sala, administrative
secretary of the Catalan Socialist party, never wrote the consultancy
reports that it was paid for.
Compounding the damage, the report claims that Filesa directly paid service
companies supplying the Socialist campaign headquarters and that in order to
disguise the payments it took receipts for them from a group of companies,
called 2020, which is controlled by Ms Aida Alvarez, a former national
co-ordinator of the Socialist party's finances.
The Filesa case is viewed by some as the mere tip of a corruption iceberg.
The 2020 group itself has been linked in press reports to large consultancy
payments made by Germany's Siemens group at the time it was negotiating the
contract to supply the Madrid-Seville high speed train. Other press reports
have suggested backhanders were common practice among suppliers to last
year's Universal Exposition in Seville and certain Seville officials are
already under judicial investigation for allegedly receiving bribes from
construction companies.
The corruption spotlight was first trained on Seville, the main Socialist
power base, in 1991 when Mr Alfonso Guerra, the city's leading Socialist
politician, was forced to resign as deputy prime minister after his younger
brother was accused of political scams at the government's local
headquarters. Mr Guerra, who remains deputy leader of the Socialist party,
is responsible for the party's electoral campaigns.
Corruption by no means appears to be exclusively a Socialist party vice. The
centre right opposition, the Partido Popular, PP, has been severely
embarrassed by real estate scandals involving the chief executive of the
regional government of Cantabria, north Spain, one of the party's fiefdoms,
and three years ago it had to sack its national treasurer who was accused of
organising illicit funding in a scandal not unlike the current Filesa
affair.
The governing Socialists are taking the flak now but the problem is general.
Spain, much like Italy, has not adequately worked out how to finance a
democratic process in which the parties run large bureaucracies and spend
heavily during a never-ending round of municipal, regional and general
elections.
Budget allocations to the parties cover only a fraction of their running
costs, party membership is low and dues are derisory, and there is no
mechanism for tax-deductible political donations, which are in any case
curtailed by law. So far, the parliamentary parties have failed to agree on
limiting their campaign expenses but all are expected to refer to the need
for such legislation in their manifestos for the general elections later
this year.
One hopeful feature in the Spanish scenario is that corruption, thanks to
the press and to individual judges, has come out into the open. The Partido
Popular, which believes that it has put its own house in order, is now
fuelling the debate, for it rightly believes that is a vote-getter.
Unlike Italy, corruption has almost certainly not permeated the entire
political system. This is not because Spaniards are more virtuous but
because democracy was reintroduced only in the late 1970s and political
parties have consequently been at the game for a shorter period. There is no
suggestion, so far, that political leaders in Spain are themselves corrupt.

to privatisation moves

<TEXT>
WHEN they really want to be nasty, which is fairly frequently, Spain's trade
unionists accuse Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government of pursuing Thatcherite
policies. This a travesty of the truth. The decade of socialist rule in
Spain has rolled forward the frontiers of the state, rather than back.
Since Mr Gonzalez formed his first government late in 1982, taxation has
become punitive and public spending has increased ever year by an average
2.3 per cent over the growth of the GDP.
The government has purposefully walked down the welfare state road.
Milestones have included substantially increased spending on pensions, where
expenditure rose from Pta1,100bn (Dollars 9bn) in 1982 to Pta3,100bn in
1991, and on education, where it went up from 2.5 per cent of the GDP in
1982 to 3.3 per cent in 1991.
Nothing could be less Thatcherite than the government's policy towards the
trade unions. Legislation during Mr Gonzalez's first term of office
significantly increased the power of works committees, formed by shop
stewards, in companies and the government is currently sponsoring a strike
law in parliament that has been largely drafted by the unions and is
virulently opposed by employers.
Union hostility towards the government, which is real enough, is in part due
to a level of unemployment that has never fallen below 15 per cent during
the Socialist decade and has currently climbed back to the 20 per cent level
of 1982. It is also a consequence of the rising expectations of society
during the boom years of the late 1980s when the rich indubitably got a lot
richer.
But union pressure ensured that industrial wages rose steeply as well in the
fattened calf years. In terms of unit labour costs Spain is now considerably
less competitive than it was when Mr Gonzalez came to power.
While the Thatcherite epithet was wholly misplaced before, unions may have
some justification in using it against the government from now on. Barring
the unlikely possibility of a Socialist-Communist party pact after the
general elections later this year, Mr Gonzalez, on his own or in coalition
with the minority nationalist parties, will be forced to shed at least a few
of his social democrat clothes.
The drift towards deregulation will be a tidal wave should the centre-right
opposition win power. The Partido Popular took a lot of pages from the UK
Conservative party book when it debated economic policy at its national
congress in February.
Privatisations will be a key area in which the diminishing presence of the
state may be measured. Outside the think tanks that nurture the Partido
Popular there is not much of a privatisation debate going on but this does
not seem to bother the government which has already embarked upon an
ambitious disposal course. For that matter, Mr Gonzalez's party never
clearly formulated a policy before on what the public sector should look
like.
Repsol, the government-controlled energy group, is to reduce state ownership
to below 50 per cent through a public share offering next month and this
placement will be followed, before the summer, by one in which Argentaria,
the wholly state-owned banking corporation, will place 25 per cent of itself
on the market.
If market conditions are right Tabacalera, the government's tobacco
monopoly, could also make a share offering before the year is out that will
reduce public ownership in the business to below the 50 per cent level.
There are at least three reasons for the rush to privatise by Mr Gonzalez's
team but the ideal of people's capitalism is not one of them. Nor have the
governing socialists been suddenly converted to the idea that private
enterprise is better at running businesses. In all the planned disposals the
state will continue to be the dominant shareholder.
EC deregulatory directives are a consideration but the most important motive
is that the government, which is intent on reducing the budget deficit and
yet faces increasing social security costs as the recession begins to bite,
needs cash. The treasury could raise more than Dollars 2bn this year from
share issues.
A third reason is that privatisation is no longer an English eccentricity:
it has become a European fad. Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman,
boasted last month that Spain was jumping ahead of France and Italy in the
queue to reach global investors.
If Mr Felipe Gonzalez is largely pursuing privatisation by default, the
Partido Popular has embraced the strategy with wholesome conviction. Mr Jose
Maria Aznar, the opposition leader, who wants to bring down taxes and reduce
the budget deficit, says a centre-right government will sell everything it
possibly can.
The Partido Popular's apparent disavowal of state intervention and of the
paternalism that traditionally framed Spanish conservative thinking is a key
political development.
At its national congress the centre-right party also adopted, not without a
certain amount of controversy, a policy called Administracion Unica or
Single Administration, that was proposed by Mr Manuel Fraga, the veteran
conservative who founded the party and who now runs the Galicia, the
autonomous region of north-west Spain. The principle behind the policy is
not unlike that of subsidiarity in the EC.
Mr Fraga broadly proposes to eliminate the duplication between Madrid's
central administration and those of the autonomous communities. The plan is
a blueprint for meaningful devolution to the regions and in one way or
another the Madrid government is going to have address this issue during the
rest of the 1990s.
Whether this will mean rolling back state frontiers or simply reinforcing
them at a mini-state level is another matter.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (11): The artistic triangle - Culture in
Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palace Hotel in Madrid, which is owned by the Ciga group, has slashed
its prices, as have all the other luxury hotels in the city. Providing an
extra perk, the Palace has struck a deal that allows its guests to jump the
queues at the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum across the street.
The onset of recession has powerfully concentrated certain minds. Along with
a more than welcome bid to make Madrid affordable, promoters have woken up
to its potential for gallery-gazing culture vultures.
It used to be said that the only valid reason for hanging around in Madrid
was the Prado museum. A score of Spanish cities, starting with Barcelona,
offer more interesting architecture, better food and less drug abuse, smog
and traffic chaos.
As of six months ago, there are two very powerful additional reasons for
staying on in Madrid after a business trip. The 800-odd works of the
Thyssen-Bornemisza collection are one and the Reina Sofia arts centre, the
now permanent home of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, is the other.
The two new museums are within five minutes' walk of the Prado and Madrid is
consequently blessed with a tight, compact triangle of artistic excellence
that is perhaps without parallel anywhere.
If one were to prolong the 'what picture would you save if the museum burnt
down?' game and play 'what neighbourhood would you spare from a global
earthquake to show succeeding generations what art is all about?', the Prado
triangle would top many discerning lists.
The government is currently negotiating the outright acquisition of the
Thyssen-Bornemisza collection. Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza says he
expects the purchase to be concluded shortly and the price mentioned,
Dollars 264m, looks a snip for it represents a tenth of the collection's
valuation and is only six times more than what Madrid is already paying for
9 1/2 years' lease of the paintings.
Every city in the world might well envy Madrid's possession of the
Thyssen-Bornemisza treasures but most dispassionate souls would concede that
its present home in an 18th century palace, expressly and expertly restored
to show off the collection, could hardly be improved. Above all, the
Thyssen-Bornemisza is exceptionally well located because of its proximity to
the Prado.
The Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza complement each other perfectly. The first
has a quite extraordinary depth, the second has an almost as extraordinary
breadth. The Thyssen-Bornemisza has something, and often several things and
of great quality, of virtually everything, from Italian primitives to pop
art. The Prado, which essentially ends its collection with its hoard of some
140 Goyas, has towering strengths but makes no pretence to be all-embracing.
There is no reason why the Prado should be. Its core is the royal collection
that was built up in the 16th and 17th centuries. With more than 30 Titians,
almost as many Tintorettos and only a few less Veronese canvases, it has
arguably the most complete rendering anywhere of the Venetian school.
The Prado is the indisputable home of Velazquez for it has every picture he
painted save a dozen or so that are elsewhere and there is, of course,
nowhere else in the world where the visitor will find some 50 elongated El
Grecos and over 80-odd voluptuous Rubens works under the same roof.
The Prado has, however, recently lost possession of Picasso's Guernica,
along with the 63 preliminary studies that the artist sketched before
embarking on his masterpiece, and also its small but impressive collection
of Juan Gris and Joan Miro canvases that were donated to the museum by the
Cubist art historian Douglas Cooper and by Miro's widow. All these pictures
were removed from a Prado annexe to the Reina Sofia arts centre which was
launched last year as the city's museum of modern and contemporary art.
Occupying a huge classical edifice that was built in the 18th century to
serve as Madrid's main hospital, the centre has space to spare for special
art shows and exhibits some 360 pictures of its permanent collection.
Weighted towards Spaniards, the centre has had a couple of windfalls with
the arrival of a large body of Miro works on the back of a death duties
arrangement and with Salvador Dali's decision to bequeath his own private
pictures to the nation.
Since Madrid now offers just about everything that an art lover could ask
for it is just as well that the hoteliers have reduced their prices.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (12): Polanco enjoys a free hand - The Media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIA moguls should set up shop in Madrid. That is what Mr Jesus Polanco did
and over the past decade he has built up the sort of empire that would raise
alarm bells among anti-trust authorities in other parts of the world.
As chairman of the Prisa group, Mr Polanco controls El Pais, which is by far
the biggest and most influential national newspaper; Sociedad Espanola de
Radiodifusion, SER, the leading commercial radio station; and Canal Plus, a
cable television channel that is now poised to make massive profits.
Mr Polanco has been able to do in Spain what Mr Silvio Berlusconi, for
example, has been barred from from doing in his country. In Italy a group
that has more than a 20 per cent quota of one media sector cannot be present
in another.
Where else, ask critics of the Prisa group, would a media conglomerate be
allowed to corner markets with such blatant impunity? The latest raid of the
Polanco empire has been on a rival commercial radio network called Antena 3
which at one point looked as if it might rock the well-established SER
pre-eminence. Prisa's astute purchase of equity in Antena 3 has apparently
neutralised the threat.
Liquidity has fuelled the group's aggressive growth. El Pais, which sells
over 400,000 copies a day and more than 1m on Sundays, posted 1992 profits
of Pta7.5bn (Dollars 647m) on a turnover of Pta60bn.
Canal Plus, launched less than three years ago and the group's heaviest
investment to date, has pulled in 630,000 subscribers which puts it
comfortably over its break-even point. Prisa's 25 per cent stake in Canal
Plus now looks like the proverbial licence to print money and the group has
announced ambitious satellite television plans.
The free hand that Mr Polanco has enjoyed in his highly successful bid to
penetrate the minds and homes of Spaniards has allowed him to become
possibly the most important man in the country. Government ministers treat
the Prisa group with awe.
El Pais has been a firm friend of the governing socialist party but when its
wide coverage of the Partido Popular's national congress last February
included a soft interview with the party's leader and a favourable editorial
that welcomed the growth of the centre-right opposition there were dark
mutterings in the corridors of power. Had Mr Polanco switched horses?
Mr Polanco and El Pais are probably quite sensibly covering their bets. The
government's unease, nevertheless, pointed to the power that is wielded by
the front-runners in the domestic media.
ABC, which has daily sales of some 280,000 and has been required reading for
Spain's conservatives since the turn of the century, often appears to create
policies for the Partido Popular rather than echo them. The independence of
Barcelona's intelligent La Vanguardia daily so discomforted the local
nationalists that they launched a rival newspaper which, predictably, gained
few readers outside the Catalan government's immediate circle.
With average sales of 230,000 three years after its launch, Madrid's El
Mundo is the fastest growing national newspaper and it has been instrumental
in setting new standards of investigative and hard-hitting journalism that
have benefited the press as a whole. The current illicit party financing
scandal, known as the Filesa case, was first broken by El Mundo nearly two
years ago.
Uncompromisingly censorious of the governing Socialists, El Mundo has
startled El Pais out of its complacency. And mindful of the Prisa group's
power, the brash newcomer to the domestic press sector is also critical of
the influence that Mr Polanco has been allowed to accumulate.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (10): Nothing is left to chance - The
tourism sector covers half the country's trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN can thank its bright sun for its tourism. Receipts from the tourism
sector were up by 6.6 per cent last year, against a GDP growth of 1.0 per
cent. As a result, they covered 50 per cent of the trade deficit.
1992 was admittedly the year when Spain staged the Barcelona Olympics and
the Seville universal exposition. Tourism could not fail to provide returns
but, given the onset of global recession, the final figures were impressive.
Mindful of the tightened European belts, the industry ministry forecasts a
modest 1 per cent growth in tourism receipts this year. The estimate could
be too conservative, for tourist entries grew by 5.3 per cent in January and
February against the first two months of last year. Although the sector's
income showed a strong growth last year, the number of actual visitors to
Spain - 55m - increased by only 3.4 per cent.
The tourist sector should certainly benefit, as far as French and German
visitors are concerned, from the 11 per cent devaluation of the peseta
within the ERM last autumn. The exchange rate boost is nevertheless tempered
by the peseta's appreciation against sterling and the lira.
Meanwhile, the continuing tragedy of former Yugoslavia will, once more, work
to Spain's advantage. Fears that once existed of cut-price competition for
the Costas from the eastern Mediterranean, as well from the North African
coast, have to a great extent been neutralised by political factors.
The fears were probably overstated. Tourism officials say that their surveys
show Spain still dominates the sun and sand market and enjoys a clear client
loyalty. Package tourists who venture elsewhere tend to return to the
well-worn Costas.
Nevertheless, the industry ministry is leaving nothing to chance. It has
boosted its advertising budget for this year by 14.6 per cent. At a time of
cost-cutting across the board, the increased expenditure is an indication of
the priority that the government gives to the tourism sector.
Beaches, naturally, form an important part of the advertising campaign
although they may look oddly solitary and wild to the package tour veterans
of the concrete high-rise resorts. There are apparently a few kilometres
left of virgin sand somewhere on the Mediterranean coast or in the Balearics
and in the Canary Islands.
Marinas and golf courses also receive due honours in a subliminal follow-up
to the sporty image created last year when Spain played host to the world's
athletes.
The main new thrust of the promotion is, however, to highlight interior
Spain with its genuinely empty landscapes punctuated by historic cities. The
tourism authorities have, for example, seized on the medieval pilgrimage
route across northern Spain that starts in the Pyrenees and ends near
Finisterre at the shrine of St James the Apostle in Compostella's cathedral.
What used to be a devotional exercise that energised hardy saints and
repentant sinners in the 11th century now threatens to become a giant
walkway for modern trekers. They might even sport the pilgrimage's
traditional cockleshell emblem on their designer backpacks.
Rarefied souls may be outraged by the high profile afforded to what the
medieval world used to know as the way of St James, but it makes sound
commercial sense.
It is a demanding month-long route that takes the walker through mountain
ranges, arid planes and, surprisingly for those who have never been to
northern Spain, lush scenery reminiscent of Ireland. Man-made highlights
include the cathedral cities of Burgos and Leon, as well as a string of
romanesque churches and convents set by isolated pueblos.
The authorities, quite properly, expect the vast majority of travellers to
shy away from the footpaths and drive to Compostella. They will not be
disappointed, either. It is one of the most memorable inland touring routes
in Europe.
The success of the Costa trade, which continues to be such a healthy golden
goose for the tourism sector, has blinded Spain's authorities to the
potential of an interior that rivals, and often surpasses, anything that
France or Italy has to offer. Major improvements to the road network have
now made it extremely accessible.
The Compostella campaign is one pilot scheme to right the balance and the
promotion of the Ruta de la Plata, or Silver Route, which links Roman mines,
cities and export centres is another. It runs parallel to Spain's border
with Portugal from Seville in the south to the north coast by Oviedo.
Again, the mix is one of breathtaking landscapes, with wildlife and
excellent birdwatching thrown in, and a lot of history. Cathedrals, castles,
Roman ruins and Roman bridges that remain in use pop up along the route, as
billboards do along a highway.
The authorities are in no urgent hurry to develop the interior although they
have their minds firmly set on doing so. Inland Spain will be opened up
gradually and thus escape the excesses that marked the sudden build-up of
the Costas. Fortunately the success of the sun and sand sector allows the
planners to take their time.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (9): The Catalan powerbroker - Profile:
Jordi Pujol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and Mr Xavier Arzallus,
leader of the Basque nationalists, are likely to get the electoral result
later this year that they have been waiting for ever since democracy was
reintroduced to post-Franco Spain. The prospect of a hung parliament
converts their regionally-based minority parties into powerbrokers.
Polls suggest that the governing Socialist party will do well to hold 160
seats in congress, 15 short of an overall majority, when general elec- tions
are held in five or six months' time. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime
minister, could therefore be forced to rely on the 18-odd members that Mr
Pujol's Convergencia i Unio (CiU) party returns to the Madrid parliament
and, con- ceivably, on the five to six that are returned by Mr Arzallus'
Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV).
With current voting trends showing a clear swing to the centre-right
opposition party, the Partido Popular (PP), the two nationalist leaders may
even find themselves being courted by both the main political groups.
Wooing the nationalists will not be an agreeable task for the Socialists or,
should it come to that, for the PP.
Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus are essentially single issue politicians. Rooted in
the mystique of their respective cultures and traditions, which they view as
the objects of sustained harassment down the ages by Madrid centralism, they
want nothing, more nor less, than ever-increasing self-government for their
communities.
Given the choice, Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus would prefer an association with
Mr Gonzalez. When they are not abstaining in the Madrid parliament, the CiU
and the PNV have tended to side with the governing party and the PNV has for
years maintained a somewhat testy relationship with the Socialists in the
Basque Country where the two parties govern in coalition, the Socialists as
junior partners.
However, neither nationalist leader is at all anxious to join a Gonzalez-led
coalition government. Should they do so, they would risk losing their
conservative supporters - the CiU and the PNV have a strong Christian
Democrat component - and they would also be challenged by the more committed
nationalist minority parties in both Catalonia and the Basque Country.
A tacit support in parliament is the most that Mr Gonzalez can expect. Mr
Pujol has said that the Catalan nationalists can be relied upon to ensure
the governance of Spain but he left unsaid, because it did not need saying,
that the price for doing so would be a set of assurances that would allow
him to govern Catalonia with as little interference as possible.
Such a federal-weighted scenario need not be as grim as some Madrid-based
politicians and political pundits make out. It would acknowledge the reality
of a multinational Spain and replace the often bruising confrontation of the
past with a hands-off and respectful collaboration.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (8): Visionary who goes by bus - Profile:
Julio Anguita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Julio Anguita would have supporters in Moscow's Congress. 'I don't follow
the latest fad, I belong to the revolutionary impulse of 1917 and I don't
have the slightest intention of changing,' he recently told an interviewer.
It looks as if domestic support is growing for the 52-year-old
secretary-general of Spain's Communist party. Polls suggest that in the
general elections later this year Izquierda Unida (IU), the leftwing
coalition which he leads, will increase its representation in the Madrid
congress from 17 to 28 seats and become the third largest party in the new
legislature.
Spaniards are not, of course, suddenly enthused about manning the Bolshevik
barricades. But Mr Anguita is set to be a main beneficiary of growing
unemployment and of the governing socialist party's record on corruption.
As Euroscepticism begins to make inroads on Spain, IU may, in addition, reap
some reward from having abstained in the parliamentary vote to ratify
Maastricht's European Union treaty while every other party voted in favour.
The abstention vote was, in fact, a compromise between Mr Anguita's
rejection of Maas- tricht and the support for the treaty voiced by a number
of leading IU parliamentarians.
It is not surprising that disillusioned Socialist voters should turn to Mr
Anguita. IU has been a consistent critic of the government's monetarist
policy and Mr Anguita himself, who habitually travels on public transport,
is widely admired for his austere lifestyle. Opponents may loathe his
politics but they do not question his personal integrity.
IU has also been adept at championing minority causes such as abortion and
conscientious objection to military service and it has a good record on
ecology and racism.
If the general elections bear out the voting trends indicated by the polls
and leave Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, well short of an overall
majority, IU will on paper be poised, as are the minority nationalist
parties, to make up the socialist shortfall by joining a coalition
government as the junior partner.
Such a development would be attractive to the left wing of the Socialist
party but it would not appeal to Mr Gonzalez who is a staunch
anti-communist. Among Spain's centre right it would inevitably conjure up
memories of the 1936 Popular Front government in the run-up to the Spanish
Civil War. Were IU to form a coalition government, exchange controls would
probably have to be reintroduced to stem the likely flight of domestic
capital.
Mr Anguita would certainly demand a steep trade-off in return for propping
up a minority socialist government. For a start, he would seek a boost in
public spending at the expense of worsening the budget deficit, a reduction
of the privatisation programme and halt to deregulation measures and,
especially, to any attempt to alter Spain's rigid hiring and firing rules.
IU's coalition shopping list is a frontal attack on every- thing that Mr
Gonzalez's present economic team stands by. It is a very pricey one and Mr
Anguita knows it. He is also unlikely to change it.
Mr Anguita, who is the sort of visionary who believes that history is on his
side, has in fact everything to gain from letting Mr Gonzalez fend for
himself. Nothing could suit him more than a weak socialist government that
is forced into compromises with the middle-of-the-road and self-seeking
nationalists.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (7): Suit may no longer fit - A look at
changing attitudes to the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Felipe Gonzalez continues to wear his European Union convictions as if
they were a close-fitting, tailor-made suit. But the prime minister is not
looking nearly so comfortable as he used to.
Spaniards in general rushed to dress up in Community clothes and for a while
they sported their new garments with pride and delight. The European look
is, however, no longer the sole rage and there are some who are begining to
question whether there is anything positive to be gained by affecting it.
Euroscepticism is obviously not a peculiarly Spanish condition and so far it
is probably less fashionable in Spain then elsewhere in the Community. But
the consequences of any second thoughts that emerge in Spain are arguably
more far-reaching because few EC partners have set such a great store on the
construction of a united Europe as has Spain.
The change in mood is not a surprise. Spain, in particular, was shocked when
Denmark voted against the Maastricht treaty last year. The Danish referendum
was hard for Spaniards to swallow because they were being called upon to
make clear sacrifices in order to converge their domestic economy with rich
northern Europe whereas Denmark's task in meeting the convergence criteria
for economic and monetary union was perceived as an effortless task.
By casting a shadow over Maastricht, the Danes moreover holed the Spanish
bond and equity markets below the waterline. Foreign investors to a great
extent withdrew their confidence in a domestic economy that had set itself a
series of goals that others apparently no longer believed in.
Mr Gonzalez was outraged at the Lisbon summit last summer when the cohesion
funds he had championed at Maastricht were far from being the flavour of the
meeting. From then on, he became increasingly suspicious of his richer
partners as well as obsessive about the need for the subsequent Edinburgh
summit to deliver a comprehensive package that would narrow the North-South
gap.
Last autumn's currency turmoil, which forced the peseta to realign twice
within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS and caused the Bank of Spain
to spend nearly a third of its reserves in its defence, fuelled the growing
sense among Spaniards that a set of dark, impersonal forces had rearranged
the goalposts on the European Union playing field.
Though Mr Gonzalez's obduracy finally obtained an agreement on cohesion
funds at Edinburgh, he received mixed reviews at home. He was alternatively,
and somewhat illogically, criticised by the opposition parties for either
gaining too little or for wounding Spanish pride by banging a begging bowl
on the Community table.
In the meantime, the cost of EC membership to broad swathes of the
population was begining to bite. In the late 1980s, as the economy boomed
and employment grew, Europe was broadly understood to mean prosperity.
Recession radically altered such a perception and protest marchers, ranging
from steel workers to farmers, descended on Madrid with the common theme
that the EC was destroying livelihoods.
Euroscepticism has, however, made far greater inroads among business.
Employers are clamouring against the high interest rates that are required
to keep the peseta within the ERM and against the restrictive budgetary
policies that are necessary to maintain Spain on course for economic and
monetary union.
The UK's decision to leave the contraints of the EMS, and the resulting
incipient growth of the British economy, is regarded as exemplary by sectors
of domestic business who argue that the peseta should be allowed to float.
Mr Gonzalez, in contrast, is increasingly hostile towards the UK's 'cut and
run' tactics, for he rightly sees them as undermining the credibility of his
own decision to cling to the convergence criteria.
The prime minister's acute problem is that the unswerving political thrust
of his long years in office, as well as his entire economic strategy, has
been underpinned by what he likes to call the 'construction of Europe'. The
finishing line that he has mapped out for Spain now seems further away than
ever and enthusiasm over the seemingly endless race is flagging.
Enlarging the EC, which is perceived in northern Europe as demonstrating the
Community's vitality, is in Spain viewed with a certain amount of distrust.
Rather than infusing new energy into the EC, it is seen as possibly sapping
its strength and, certainly, as dispersing further what little common
purpose might remain among the Twelve.
Seen from Madrid, an enlarged Community will place Spain on the periphery of
the Brussels decision-making processes and widen the North-South divide.
Issues that are vitally important to Spain, such as the North African
immigration problem, risk receiving even less of a hearing in a Community
that is tilted towards north and central Europe than they do at present.
Mr Gonzalez himself is one of the main advocates of 'deepening' the
Community, of bonding it together through mechanisms such as the cohesion
funds and an increasing EC budget, before allowing in new members. He knows,
however, that he has few allies among the Twelve's leadership and that he is
unlikely to get a better deal on narrowing the Community's imbalances than
the one he obtained at the Edinburgh summit.
With elections due later this year and as the polls begin to show a
neck-and-neck struggle developing between Mr Gonzalez's socialist party and
the centre-right opposition, the prime minister's despondency is likely to
grow apace with hostility over the EC. Mr Gonzalez's obstinate adherence to
convergence as Spain enters recession may be his undoing.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (6): How Gonzalez may keep his party in
power - A look at the Socialists' prospects in this year's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<TEXT>
SPAIN has a terrible memory. Or, at least, it often chooses simply not to
remember what is inconvenient. One result of this is that the Spanish civil
war and the ensuing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco are not taught
in Spanish schools.
Officials say it is still too soon to be able to teach the period
objectively. There are other symptoms of this happy forgetfulness, most
often reflected in the scarcity of libraries and the absurdly cliquey tone
of any serious historical discussion.
Thus it should have been no surprise to Mr Felipe Gonzalez when he turned up
to speak at a university near Madrid last month that he was booed and sworn
at. After all, his Socialist party has been involved in at about half a
dozen public scandals in the past five years over influence peddling and
corrupt party financing. 'Thief,' cried the students.
Some of the prime minister's most vociferous opponents saw in this the end
for the man who has governed Spain since 1982 and who must call a general
election before the end of this year. In a deepening recession, with an
increasingly fractured and inward-looking party, the Socialist vote is
slipping at a giddy rate. The campus reception was a final stripping away of
the Gonzalez aura, opponents said.
Perhaps. The rise of Mediterranean social democracy in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, which saw socialist parties rise to power and influence in
France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal is being brought to an abrupt end.
Greece and Portugal have turned right. In France, a lone president has
recently seen his party swept away by an ill-tempered electorate. In Italy,
Socialist leaders are among the central targets of the c o u n t r y ' s
anti-corruption campaign. In Spain, the Socialists have trapped themselves
in their own (though compared to Italy and France, relatively modest)
corruption quagmire.
Spain, though, is not Italy and its Socialists are not as unpopular as
France's. Until the election, though, one of Mr Gonzalez's main problems is
simply that fact that there are about 3m young voters in Spain, some of whom
turned up to jeer or cheer him last month, who have no idea of what life was
like under another leader. Thus, with unemployment at record levels and
rising and the media successfully (but misleadingly) painting the Gonzalez
administration as corrupt, it must all be his fault.
Combined with this is Spain's natural isolationism. Its government may be
more obvious abroad, but Spaniards remain generally uninterested in the rest
of the world. It is reasonable to assume that the students screeching at Mr
Gonzalez read no foreign media and speak fewer languages than most of their
European Community counterparts (though probably more than British
students).
This, combined with a flawed ability (for lack of education for which the
present government is entirely responsible) to make comparisons with Spain's
recent past, is an explosive mixture for a politician who has to explain
that Spain's recession is part of a global phenomenon and that the country
has made great strides in the last 10 years and is much richer now than it
was then.
If Mr Gonzalez were able to go into the election campaigning on his 10-year
record, he would probably have little trouble winning a fourth overall
majority. But he is not. The economic boom of 1986 to 1989 has been quickly
forgotten and he is campaigning on his third term only.
That, unfortunately, is not much to go on. Perhaps only one minister will
have come out of the last four years having done something he actually set
out to do - Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, the interior minister, who has presided
over the near dismemberment of Eta, the Basque terrorist group, and pushed
controversial anti-drug legislation through parliament despite strong media
opposition.
For the rest, the term has been wasted and filled with upsets. A scandal
surrounding the brother of the former deputy prime minister paralysed
government and party for all its first year. In 1991 the Filesa scandal
broke - and has come back to haunt the government until the election. Filesa
was a bogus consulting company that took money from banks and manu-
facturers for non-existent services and used the money to finance Socialist
election campaigns. 1992 was frittered away celebrating the Expo in Seville
and the Olympics in Barcelona.
Meanwhile, no-one in government dared tell the country how badly things were
getting and there was thus never any time to build a consensus about how to
deal with the coming crisis. Employers threw money at the unions and Mr
Gonzalez al- lowed party pressure to derail public spending controls in the
1990, 1991 and 1992 budgets. By the time Spain began its slide into
recession at the start of last year, it had still not begun to cut its debt
and was more heavily dependent on using high interest rates to attract
foreign savings to finance itself than ever before.
An optimistic programme of economic convergence (with the rest of the EC
ahead of monetary and economic union) was rushed out in the spring but its
public debt, deficit, growth and inflation targets quickly fell by the way.
By the summer, the government had brought forward indirect tax increases and
gone back on a promised income tax cut to save its 1992 budget. By the end
of 1992 though, official statistics confirmed the worst - unemployment had
risen to more than 3m and fixed investment had fallen by more than 4 per
cent.
How Mr Gonzalez gets out of this is a mystery, though it would be foolish to
write him off. Whenever they vote, Spaniards chose leaders and not
necessarily for his politics, provided the politics are broadly centrist.
The prime minister is still easily the most popular politician in the
country and he is still selling his mixture of tepid supply-side growth
policies and high social spending. Spaniards like it, though Mr Gonzalez is
highly unlikely to be able to retain a majority in the 350-seat Cortes and
will probably be forced into a coalition.
Recent polls, though, have shown the conservative Partido Popular
practically level with the Socialists at between 33 per cent and 34 per cent
of the vote each. In large part this is due to the way that the PP's young
leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, has been able to focus on the government's
record on corruption.
What the polls do not show, though, is that the Socialists still lead the PP
by a long way among voters who have already made up their minds how to vote.
The battle will be for an increasingly large number of undecided voters and
that may still be where the prime minister has an edge.
Whatever the state of the economy or the force of the argument that Mr
Gonzalez has been slow to deal with corruption in his party, uncertain
voters may feel more comfortable with his experience. Mr Aznar grows more
impressive by the day, but it is still hard to believe that Spaniards are
going to give him a working majority. The PP also has a major hurdle in any
national poll in that it has to fight conservative regionalist parties in
important autonomies such as the Basque Country, Catalonia and Aragon.
On balance, both the Basque and Catalan nationalist majorities would
probably prefer to be part of a coalition with Mr Gonzalez at a national
level than with Mr Aznar. For either leader, though, coalition with a
regional party will be very difficult as it is bound to involve trading off
greater regional autonomy in return for support in Madrid.
That gives rise to a previously untested possibility - that the 1993
election will leave Spain with a leftwing government. Polls show that the
PP's gains have been mainly at the expense of the Centro Democratico y
Social (CDS), the rapidly imploding party of Mr Adolfo Suarez, the former
prime minister. The Socialists, on the other hand, have been shedding votes
to their left, to the communist-led Izquierda Unida (IU).
If the post-election arithmetic allows it, the Socialist party, which is,
anyway, to the left of the Gonzalez government, may force a union with the
IU. Mr Gonzalez would probably leave office rather than make this deal but
the party may well let him go. All the party really wants him for now is to
put them in a position to form a government.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (4): When a king can decide - Juan Carlos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOLE explicitly political role that King Juan Carlos is called upon to
play under the terms of the Spanish constitution is to consult the leaders
of the parties that have contested an election and select one of them to be
prime minister. The prospect of a hung parliament later this year is likely
to make the selection process a delicate task, writes Tom Burns.
There is no precedent for such constitutional fine tuning. In the past the
monarch's consultations were a mere formality because in each of the five
previous parliaments of his reign one party, first the Centrists and
subsequently the Socialists, had a clear ascendancy in the legislature.
In the circumstances it is useful that King Juan Carlos' profile should be
riding as high at present as it was at the beginning of the 1980s when his
decisive support of constitutional legality saved Spain's nascent democracy
from a right-wing military coup.
Two recent developments have served to project the king. One is the
publication of an authorised biography, written in the form of an extended
interview, that has become a runaway bestseller. The other mood is of
national grief prompted by the terminal illness over the past few weeks of
Don Juan, Count of Barcelona, the monarch's father.
In the book the king successfully walks a tightrope by being respectful
about General Franco who placed him on the throne and also respectful to his
father who was banished by Franco on account of his liberal views. The dual
theme of the biography has something for everybody: Franco gave the king a
free hand to govern after him as he saw fit and Don Juan, who was to
abdicate his rights in favour of his son, bequeathed to his son both the
legitimate line of succession and the constitutional ideas that he had lived
by.
The passing of Don Juan will be marked by a royal pomp and circumstance that
was absent in 1975 when the king succeeded Franco. The king, who has lately
spent most of his time at his father's bedside, has drawn up plans for a
lying-in-state in the royal palace and a solemn burial in the royal crypt of
the Escorial monastery which has hitherto been reserved for monarchs.
The book, 'El Rey' by Jose Luis de Villalonga, is the king's own version of
recent Spanish history and promotes him as the guarantor of the nation's
stability. Don Juan's funeral will affirm before the Spanish public, for the
first time in generations, the grandeur of the monarchy as an institution.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (2): Markets distrust dogma - Why the
Convergence Plan may come to grief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Felipe Gonzalez is often described as a pragmatic politician whose
governments understand that politics is the art of the possible. But that is
demonstrably not true where economic policy is concerned.
The doctrinaire espousal of economic and monetary union within the EC is a
case in point. The government has fixed its sights on converging with the
rich Community economies, worked out how to reach its target in closed doors
meetings of motivated policy makers and relentlessly set out on its course
although it may scorch the earth it treads on.
'We have made a commitment to Europe and to economic and monetary union and
we believe that Spain will, in 1997 or in 1999, be a member of the group of
European nations that will redefine the role of Europe in the world's
economy,' Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, told domestic and
international businessmen in January. 'Because of this, the government, for
several months now, has considered the macroeconomic and monetary measures
in the Convergence Plan to be a priority.'
With hindsight, the most distressing aspect of Mr Solchaga's January
panegyric of Spain in a fast-track Europe was that he got his sums wrong. He
told his audience it was 'probable' that in 1992 GDP grew by 1.5 per cent.
Less than two months later it was revealed that GDP had grown by just 1 per
cent.
The Convergence Plan that the policy makers drew up in April last year was a
set of targets through to 1996 that would allow Spain to meet the criteria
for joining Economic and Monetary Union laid down at Maastricht. A year
later, the plan is hopelessly off target.
According to the plan, fixed capital formation should have grown by 3.2 per
cent in 1992. In the event, it fell by 3 per cent during the year and by 6
per cent in the last quarter. The construction sector, which should have
shown 2.4 per cent growth, shrank by 4 per cent and by 6.3 per cent in the
last three months of the year.
At the begining of 1992, Mr Solchaga's economic team forecast a GDP growth
rate of 3.3 per cent, which was marginally trimmed four months later to 3
per cent by the Convergence Plan. The estimates were mere wishful thinking.
In the last quarter of 1992 GDP grew by only 0.2 per cent and Spain formally
entered a recession.
Inflation, which came down to 4 per cent year on year in February against
5.4 per cent at the end of December was the sole element in the Convergence
Plan in line with last April's forecasts. Nevertheless, the fall in prices
owed virtually everything to the economy's accelerated depression.
The government's main problem is that it continues to treat convergence
towards economic and monetary union as an article of faith; as usually
occurs among those embracing a dogma, it is quite unaware of the disbelief
among others.
The markets do not have much time for the convergence criteria and, should
there be a fast-track Europe, they are entirely sceptical about Spain
running on it. Midway through last year, the markets began to make the
obvious point that the peseta was overvalued in the exchange rate mechanism
of the European monetary system and they forced it to devalue within the
mechanism by 5 per cent in September and by 6 per cent in November.
By far the cruellest cut came earlier this year from Mr Jacques Delors, the
EC commission president. He was widely quoted as saying that Spain could not
expect to join the inner EMU core when more than 20 per cent of its labour
force was unemployed.
Mr Solchaga testily replied that employment was not one of Maastricht's
convergence criteria; he was perfectly right in saying so. However the
response that Mr Delors, and for that matter the markets, were looking for
had to do with the credibility of the Spanish economy and Mr Solchaga did
not have one readily available.
In the past weeks the people who matter in the Spanish economy - and that
means the business community, not the policy makers - have indicated that
they no longer believe in either the Convergence Plan or economic and
monetary union. Their disbelief is likely to gather momentum.
The business community accuses the government of putting the economy into a
straitjacket. Convergence is likened to a corset that has squeezed market
enterprise to the point that it can scarcely breathe.
Last year profits were down almost across the board and 847 companies
applied for protection from their creditors. The number of companies that
entered receivership last year was only slightly less than the total in 1982
when Spain's previous slump peaked but the accumulated debts last year of
the troubled businesses stood at Pta780bn (Dollars 6.6bn) which in constant
pesetas was nearly double the 1982 debt total.
Mr Solchaga is now warning that things will get worse before they get
better. Few in Spain see any significant recovery this year and bad debts
are set to accumulate.
Business in Spain is fettered by two sets of chains. The first is the very
high cost of borrowing - the Bank of Spain's official intervention rate
stands at 13 per cent - which the government maintains in order to defend
the peseta within the exchange rate mechanism and to attract capital inflows
that will finance the budget deficit.
The second shackle is the government's unwillingness in an election year to
liberalise an extremely rigid labour legislation that makes lay-offs
prohibitively expensive.
It is hard to find a senior business executive in Spain who does not believe
that sooner if not later the government will kick-start the economy by
devaluing the peseta and cutting interest rates. After this year's
elections, what is left of the Convergence Plan is almost certain to be
thrown out of the window.

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (5): Practices under threat - Impact of the
anti-trust authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the government last year published a bold convergence programme to put
the country on track for the EC's economic and monetary union, Spain's
fledgling anti-trust authority was given a high profile and a large brief.
The local equivalent of the UK's Office for Fair Trading, known as the
Tribunal de Defensa de la Competencia, was called on to study price fixing,
monopolies and restrictions on professional activities and to identify the
inflationary impact of such activities.
The tribunal, chaired by Mr Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, a former
treasury official and executive director of the International Monetary Fund,
has proved equal to the challenge.
At the end of last month the Economy Ministry was already presenting a
legislative package based on the tribunal's recommendations to the Madrid
parliament. It seeks to overhaul restrictive practices in professions
ranging from lawyers and architects to dentists and customs agents.
The ministry has in the meantime received a second weighty report that
reviews price-fixing and other cartel practices in various sectors including
telecommunications, electricity distribution, transport and real estate. Mr
Fernandez Ordonez, the tribunal's president, delights in the workload that
he and his 35-strong staff have taken on: 'In Spain we have many more
restrictions than in Europe or the US.'
There is every reason for the government to keep commissioning papers from
the tribunal, for Mr Fernandez Ordonez to motivate his aides into rapidly
delivering the reports and for the government to act speedily on the advice
it receives. There is a two-track inflation in Spain: one, which is low and
accounts for price rises in industrial sectors that are open to competition,
and another that is extraordinarily high and belongs to the service sector
activities that are currently under the tribunal's scrutiny.
'In the areas that concern me,' says Mr Fernandez Ordonez, 'it is as if the
European Community and the single market never happened.'
The duality is revealed in a chart showing price rises in services and
industry that takes a base of 100 in August 1983. Inflation in both sectors
rose evenly until Spain joined the EC in 1986. From then on, the trends are
markedly divergent. At the end of 1992, prices in the industrial sector had
risen to just over 140. Those in the service sector had shot up to almost
230.
For Mr Fernandez Ordonez, as indeed for the government, it is a self-evident
truth that domestic inflation will be radically improved just as soon as
there is a thoroughgoing deregulation of the service sector which will
expose it, as has occurred in the industrial sector, to the full impact of
competition.
The professions, which constitute a set of strong pressure groups in Spain
as in everywhere else, were a useful starting point for the tribunal, with
the break-up of their restrictive practices receiving a full airing in the
press. Among the recommendations adopted by the government were measures
that seek to end a ban on publicity, a ruling that limits the number of
lawyers in a single law firm to 20 and a strict set of demarcation practices
that forbids a law firm to do business outside its own judicial area,
normally the province where the firm is registered.
The tribunal has also trained its sights on the system by which architects'
fees for new building projects are fixed at between 5-8 per cent of the
value of the development. As a result, the very notion of a competitive
price is studiously ignored.
Mr Fernandez Ordonez is rightly suspicious of the rigidities that shackle
the real estate sector. Zoning regulations, he admits, are entirely
necessary but he stresses that in Spain, with local town and village
councils wielding huge power over who builds what and where, such
regulations have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous.
Spain, for example, has one of the lowest ratios in Europe of petrol
stations per cars. This was the result of a government-controlled petrol
distribution monopoly that was abolished two years ago in accordance with an
EC directive. Contrary to expectations, there has not been a proliferation
of new stations as obtaining the required permit from the local authority is
complex and, above all, costly.
Excessive rigidity in the real estate sector meant that office rents soared
in the late 1980s when demand was high. When all the zoning hurdles were
overcome and offices finally came on the market, Spain was entering a
recession and demand had slumped. Madrid has gone from having very few and
very expensive business locations to having a lot of empty ones.
Is the tribunal taking on too much? Mr Fernandez Ordonez is infectiously
optimistic about his brief. In addition to the government's backing, he
believes that Spanish society as a whole passionately wants as much
deregulation as possible. 'Spaniards are crazy about liberty and are all for
it. This is precisely because they have for so long been forced to live with
so much corporatism.'

FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (1): All depends on Gonzalez - After 10
years in power, the Socialists face an election that they seem unlikely to
win outright. It is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about them.
But Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, may still have a chance to stop the
rot

<TEXT>
IF recessions were tests of national mettle, Spain would not be doing very
well at all.
Two quarters of falling GDP and the country is behaving as if the sky had
fallen in. Partly, this is simply the impression the anti-government print
media (that is to say, most national newspapers) are trying to foment ahead
of this year's general election.
Every march of farmers or steelworkers on Madrid, every unhappy economic
statistic, is magnified and trumpeted from the opposition ramparts. The
cobwebbed old views of the government's critics in big business and the
unions have been polished up and paraded as new evolutions of political
thought.
It is pre-campaign politics as usual, with the Socialist government paying
the price of a decade in power. It says it is sticking to its orthodox
economic guns and is lambasted for having no new ideas. A new jobs programme
is rejected as too little, too late. When Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime
minister, went to France last year to support the French government's Yes
campaign in the Maastricht referendum, he was attacked for not asking
Spaniards the same question. When his main conservative opponent flew to
Paris a few weeks ago for a 10-second photo opportunity with Mr Jacques
Chirac, he was hailed as a statesman.
But the media froth does not entirely smother the view. For above it, or
through it, a picture of a very depressed Spain is emerging. In the cities,
smooth financial types who have basked in the reflected international glory
of Mr Gonzalez for most of the 10 years the Socialists have been in power
have begun to say he should go now that their jobs may be threatened by
recession.
In the countryside, recent polls show the Socialists can count on the sure
support of only two of the country's 17 autonomous regions - Andalucia and
poverty-stricken Extremadura. By no coincidence, these are the only regions
where Madrid operates a rural unemployment scheme under which small town
mayors pay out-of-work farm workers a special benefit. Most of the mayors
are Socialist and provided the payments keep coming, it stays that way.
The polls may be misleading. Certainly, the Socialists think they are. But
with company failures running at record levels, unemployment over 3m and
little chance of respite this year, it is hard to find anyone with a good
word to say about the government. It is odd, though. Unemployment may be
above 20 per cent now but at the very height of the boom in the late 1980s,
it was still well above 15 per cent. Spain is also much richer than the last
time it was in this much economic trouble and should be able to deal with it
far more smoothly.
All this makes it difficult to know whether Spaniards are depressed or
whether they think they are or whether they think they ought to be. The
answer matters for two reasons. First, Spain's allies are learning what may
be valuable lessons about how the country reacts when the going gets tough.
Second, it makes it easier to live with the uncertainty about who will win
the election. It could be another eight months yet.
What matters is which big party gets to form what will almost certainly be
Spain's first democratically elected coalition or minority government since
the end of the civil war in 1939. Another overall majority, least of all a
fourth one for the Socialists, seems impossible now. There are only two
contenders - the Socialists and the conservative Partido Popular (PP), the
democratic progeny of Franco's movemiento.
For the last 10 years the Socialists have kept the AP/PP at bay by holding
firmly to the middle ground in economic and social policies. It has taken
the PP that long to begin to bury its Francoist past.
Now for the first time, the PP is making a real effort to shove the
Socialists off the centre line, especially on economic policy. They are
promising tax cuts where the Socialists have been forced to delay them. They
will privatise deeper and faster than the government.
This will help, the theory goes, to cut interest rates which have been kept
artificially high in order to attract foreign investment to feed the state's
vast appetite for debt. With low interest rates and lower taxes, Spain will
be able to resume its happy progress.
Business has already given the PP its blessing, though that is little
wonder. To put it politely, a PP-led administration would be very close to
the Spanish employers' organisation, the CEOE, whose president, Mr Jose
Maria Cuevas, is a much more cogent critic of the government than the PP
leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar.
The PP, which is gaining support in the cities, could just win enough seats
to allow it to put together a coalition, though it is far from clear with
whom that would be. It is also not clear that it would be in a position to
do any of the things it claims to stand for.
Most of Spain's public sector companies are loss-makers and probably
unsellable. The other few are already being privatised, though slowly. In
addition, the conservatives have little appetite for the dereg- ulation the
Socialists are forcing upon the country's service industries.
The difference a PP-led government would make would be threefold.
First, it would refocus economic policy priorities towards local business,
probably paying less attention to the country's image among foreign
investors.
Second, it would force the pace on devolving more political power to the
country's autonomous regions - because to be in government the PP needs to
join forces with at least one and possibly two regional parties which would
probably demand a high price for their co-operation.
Third, foreign policy would become more nationalistic.
Mr Gonzalez has until the end of November to hold his election, and hopes
that by then some good economic news will have begun to seep into the arena.
Inflation is at least falling and making room for dramatic interest rate
cuts later in the year.
On the whole, the prime minister has little to be ashamed of after 10 years
in power although he has been remarkably slow to appreciate the damage that
repeated charges of corruption have done to his party. Only now, as a
scandal over clearly illicit party financing has become more toxic than
most, is he showing any signs of concern.
The mixture of recession and corruption is potent. According to an important
recent poll in the El Pais newspaper, the Socialists and the PP are neck and
neck, with the Socialist vote falling fast. The danger to the government is
that if nothing is done, there might come a point where the trend becomes
irreversible.
The only person who can do anything is Mr Gonzalez. For all the party's
posturing to his left, it needs him to win. He has to stop the rot before
the August summer break, perhaps long before. One opportunity will be a
state of the nation debate later this month. People have been saying for
years that Felipe is tired and dispirited. The next few weeks will tell. He
has to pull his socks up.

FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism ahead of the results from Burmah Castrol proved thoroughly
justified as the group announced profits above most analysts' expectations,
figures which drove Burmah shares up to their best level for more than nine
years.
Burmah's net income came in at Pounds 90.2m, well above the most optimistic
forecasts, as was the dividend. Most analysts pencilled in a current year
forecast of Pounds 100m-plus, following what was described as a very
successful post-results meeting.
Burmah shares, among the market's best performers in the past week, closed
18 higher at 750p, after touching 757p.
British Petroleum shares continued to lose ground, with the market reacting
to hints that a possible blockbusting rights issue may be in the process of
being put together by City merchant banks. It was hinted that the
derivatives market had picked up the scent of an exceptionally large put
trade in the making.
A record-breaking rights issue at BP has long been mooted, although many
analysts take the view that a massive call on shareholders could still be at
least a year away. At the close of trading BP were 6 weaker at 297 1/2 p
with 10m shares dealt.
Recent weakness in Lasmo shares, triggered by what has been seen as a poor
response by institutions to a recent series of post-results presentations,
was arrested as a number of big funds were said to have switched from
Enterprise into Lasmo. The latter edged up 2 1/2 to 158p on 3.7m traded,
while Enterprise weakened 12 to 506p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The implications of the share suspension of Queens Moat Houses continued to
unfold, with the focus shifting to Forte, Britain's biggest hotel group. One
prognosis had Forte satisfying its long-declared interest in mainland Europe
by picking up Queens Moat hotels there, should the embattled group be forced
to sell. A rights issue by Forte would then become necessary, suggested
market voices.
Queens Moat's demise also refocused attention on the wider problems of the
hotel market and again threw up worries for Forte's dividend when results
are announced in two weeks' time. Forte fell 8 to 184p on big turnover of
10m. Ladbroke Group lost 5 to 176p - a scrip issue announcement came after
the market had closed.
Brewer Bass appeared to be playing down suggestions that it might be
interested in buying some Queens Moat properties, telling analysts it was
not interested in owning more hotels. Bass shares responded favourably,
rising 9 to 555p.

FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome faces new pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was hit in early trading
by concern raised by an impending article in The Lancet, the UK premier
medical journal.
The article apparently relates to an extensive trial of Wellcome's key
anti-Aids drug Retrovir, or AZT, and was expected by the market to have a
negative effect. In particular, the article seems likely to undermine the
long-held hope that Retrovir can be used for carriers of the disease as well
as Aids sufferers. Analysts estimate that there are some 1.5m carriers in
the developed world compared with 150,000 sufferers.
Analysts said there was a further knock from a presentation in Philadelphia
by SmithKline Beecham, which gave research details of a rival to Wellcome's
main drug Zovirax, the anti-herpes product. The shares were off 28 at worst
but, partly because they had already fallen from above 900p since the
figures last week and partly because of the very tight security surrounding
the article ahead of publication today, the price stabilised. The stock
ended 19 lower at 743p on turnover of 4.9m.

FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains lost in cautious trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND quarter of 1993 made an unpromising start on the UK stock market
yesterday, with some fund managers still unhappy with current valuations of
an equity sector which has made little progress over the opening three
months of the year. Early gains in share prices faded away in the second
half of the session when dollar weakness took the heart out of the blue
chips.
Interest rate hopes, already challenged by the UK chancellor of the
exchequer and by the governor of the Bank of England, receded when the
Bundesbank left rates unchanged, although the outcome of the German bank's
policy meeting had been largely discounted in London. However, the strength
of sterling later in the session brought suggestions from some analysts that
a cut in UK base rates might not be out of the question.
Share prices opened lower as the pharmaceutical leaders turned down,
following Wall Street's setback overnight. But the initial dip in market
indices was recovered when stock index futures opened and the June contract
on the FT-SE 100 Index at first extended its move above 2,900.
By midsession the market was more than 9 points ahead on the Footsie scale,
although trading was uneventful. The hotel and leisure sector remained very
nervous as it awaited further news from Queens Moat Houses, sus-pended in
the previous session and due to report profits next week.
The day's list of company news brought mixed fortunes for the shares
concerned and left unanswered the market's doubts over the progress of
economic recovery in the US. Weakness in the drug stocks, joined by falls in
other dollar-related issues, steadily eroded the market's gain and by the
close many share prices were little changed on the day.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished at 2,878.4, leaving a net loss of just 0.3. In
the first quarter of the year, which closed on Wednesday night, the index
shows a gain of barely 1 per cent after giving back nearly 80 points since
the UK Budget of March 16.
Retail, or customer, business in equities, which has remained high since the
middle of September last year, when sterling departed from the ERM network,
totalled Pounds 1.54bn on Wednesday. Yesterday's Seaq volume dipped to
676.7m shares from the previous day's 821.8m, with non-Footsie business
falling away from recent daily averages to make up only about 51 per cent of
yesterday's total.
Sector performances indicated that investors were continuing to rotate
portfolios, rather than put new money in or take cash out of equities. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which takes in a range of second line stocks, shed just
0.6 to 3,107.2.
The overall picture was somewhat irregular. In addition to the
pharmaceuticals and hotel sectors, merchant banking and building material
stocks gave ground. But stores and construction issues, both linked closely
to interest rate views, attracted buyers. In many cases, investors were
merely moving back into sectors which are perceived as having suffered
unduly in the past fortnight.
Traders commented that the big institutions have not yet opened their equity
campaigns for the second quarter of the year.

FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range as dealers reflected on current
interest rate policy in both the UK and Germany following the decision of
the Bundesbank to leave rates unchanged, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index started the day in positive mood at
2,901, more or less where it had ended the previous session, and was in
demand from the outset which led it to advance to 2,908 by 10am.
The contract then traded sideways before sellers emerged, taking the view
that the gains had gone too far. June then drifted to the day's low of 2,888
just after 11am and remained at the lower levels after the Bundesbank made
its announcement on interest rates, which did not surprise the market.
A feeling that there may still be a reduction in UK rates, however, saw June
recover the lost ground and by 2.30pm it was trading at 2,909.
Profit-taking towards the close saw June end at 2,894, down 6 from
Wednesday's finish and around 3 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 11. Volume was 9,306 lots.
There was little strength in traded options. Some 24,583 contracts were
dealt, of which 5,273 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,991 in the Euro
FT-SE option. Asda was the busiest stock option with 2,962 traded, followed
by Marks and spencer at 2,448.

FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Mixed trend as doubts arise
over jobless data
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended with no clear trend in moderate trading yesterday,
after an unexpectedly poor set of jobless claims data had raised worries
that today's March employment report would reveal renewed weakness in the
labour market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.33 at 3,439.44. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.37 down at 450.30, while the American SE
composite ended 0.66 easier at 422.77 and the Nasdaq composite 3.49 off at
686.64. New York SE volume came to 234.5m shares.
There was no follow-through from Wednesday's late declines, primarily
because the selling was attributed to institutional investors unwinding
options positions in listed and over-the-counter stocks.
The market, in fact, was resilient, brushing off the morning's employment
news, which showed a much larger than expected 33,000 rise in weekly jobless
claims. Normally, the figures might have frightened investors, because they
suggested that the labour market continues to struggle in spite of recent
improvements in economic growth.
Investors, however, chose to wait for today's more important and revealing
March employment report. Analysts are expecting it to show a rise of between
75,000 and 100,000 in non-farm payrolls. If the figure comes in well below
that range, then the sell-off that might have followed yesterday's jobless
claims release could be triggered.
The day's other main piece of economic news - a small decline in the
National Association of Purchasing Management's March index of business
activity - had little discernible impact on market sentiment, although the
figures added to other recent data which suggest that economic growth in the
first quarter may have slowed from the strong rates seen at the end of 1992.
Drug shares featured again. After posting gains early on Wednesday on
reports that the Clinton administration may not, after all, consider
imposing controls on pharmaceuticals prices, many of the leading issues have
run into concerted selling.
Among the biggest stocks, Pfizer fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 ,
Merck slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 3/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson receded
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 and Schering-Plough lost Dollars 1 to
Dollars 59.
Cable television stocks tumbled after the Fed Communications Commission
voted to set a benchmark for prices charged by the industry. Cablevision
fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Time Warner Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
33, Comcast Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 and TCI Dollars 2 to Dollars 20
1/2 .
Merrill Lynch advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 in busy trading on
figures which showed that it had retained its position in the first quarter
as the biggest underwriter of stock and bonds in the US.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were mixed. Microsoft gained
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 93 and Apple Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 51 3/4 , but
Intel lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 111 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest gain after active trading. The TSE 300 index
finished 12.1 higher at 3,614.5 and advances led declines by 395 to 292
after volume of 66.8m shares.
Talisman Energy said a venture with Amoco Canada Petroleum reported a major
wildcat gas discovery in the Sukunka in British Columbia. The stock rose
CDollars 1 to CDollars 20 1/4 .

FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Golds put industrials in
shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHANNESBURG drifted lower following Wednesday's hectic trade. The overall
index, down 15 at 3,544, incorporated falls of 13 to 4,413 in industrials
and 14 to 1,191 in golds.
This followed a chart-topping performance for the market over the first
three months of 1993. South Africa led the FT-Actuaries World Indices, both
in sterling and US dollar terms, with gains of 19.65 and 18.97 per cent
respectively.
The figures reflect recovery in the financial rand, up 7 per cent against
the dollar and 9 per cent against sterling this year, after a 34 per cent
drop against the dollar in 1992. In local currency terms, South African
equities still managed a rise of 11.14 per cent.
The overall index performance masks the conflict between gold mining stocks
and a muted industrial sector. By the end of March the JSE Gold index was up
51 per cent over three months, against a 1 per cent gain in industrials.
Brokers were saying yesterday that there could be more to come in golds,
which have attracted income funds and gold funds from around the world in
pursuit of the high dividend yields available, and the assumed protection
from international strife. 'Even today you can get yields of 10 per cent,
net of withhold-ing tax,' commented one broker yesterday.

FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba disappoints over rates
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, there was apparent disappointment among bourses that the
Bundesbank made no further cuts in key interest rates yesterday. The feeling
seemed more acute in Paris than in Germany itself, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS may have had additional reasons. Apart from the lack of an interest
rate move, either from the Bundesbank or from the Bank of France, brokers in
Paris were saying that the market was overbought while Nomura, in London,
reduced its weighting in French equities to zero.
The CAC-40 index ended 25.49, or 1.25 per cent lower at 2,005.89 and
turnover, on an estimate, fell from FFr4.1bn to FFr2.2bn.
Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials group, fell FFr35, or 6.6 per
cent to FFr498 as its chairman forecast lower 1993 profits. Euro Disney
dropped FFr4.90 to FFr91.80 on profit-taking and LVMH, the luxury goods
combine, lost FFr81 at FFr3,660 for the same reason.
Schneider, in electrical engineering and construction, continued its slide,
losing FFr25 to FFr675 as its parent, SPEP, climbed FFr24 to FFr463,
arbitrage between the two exploring the possibility of a merger.
FRANKFURT closed barely above its lows with the DAX index down 12.63 at
1,671.58, heavily influenced by falls in Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Hoechst.
Turnover fell from DM5.8bn to DM4.6bn. The downturn in the DAX also marked
the start of a new quarter after the window-dressing seen on Monday and
Tuesday, when the index gained 23 points.
Allianz fell DM37 to DM2,173 and Deutsche Bank by DM7 to DM706.50. Brokers
said that the financials may have reacted to the Bundesbank decision, as
well as to the ongoing correction on the domestic bond market.
Hoechst lost DM4.80 to DM251.60. It now has the lowest dividend of the big
three chemical stocks, and has suffered lately from a string of accidents
involving spills, embarrassment and a threat to the costs of the sector.
ZURICH edged back from the record closing levels of the previous two
sessions. The SMI index eased 1.9 to 2,188.4, with continuing strength in
blue chip issues preventing a sharper downturn.
Roche certificates dipped SFr40 in immediate response to results but picked
up to end unchanged at SFr4,170. A 29 per cent rise in group profit compared
with estimates that had ranged from 15 to 40 per cent, but one analyst noted
that the figures had been depressed by an unexpected SFr208m provision to
cover employee health care costs in the US.
CS Holding saw strong demand as several 'buy' recommendations were issued
after the IBCA rating agency assigned an AA long-term rating to the company.
CS Holding registered, SFr8 higher at SFr450, was the most active stock.
Jelmoli bearers, which had been suspended on Wednesday pending results, fell
SFr150 or 10.7 per cent to SFr1,250. The retailer said that it would buy out
minority shareholders in its subsidiaries by offering Jelmoli shares.
Movenpick, the restaurants and hotels group, saw its registered shares fall
SFr41 or 5.5 per cent to SFr700 in response to this week's appointment of
the third chief executive in two years.
MILAN trading slowed down after a firm opening as increasingly nervous
investors surveyed a government in political limbo. The Comit index finished
4.72 higher at 479.73.
The construction and cement sectors put in a strong performance on
expectations that the government planned agreements with individual regions
to re-start public building contracts, held up by investiations in the
political corruption scandal.
Premafin, the building development company, slid L170 to fix at L4,630 but
then soared to L5,150 after-hours, a 7 per cent rise on the day.
Italmobiliare rose L800 to L40,500 and Italcementi rose L283 to L11,276.
Gemina, a financial holding company with links to Fiat SpA, rallied L39 or
3.7 per cent to L1,105 in response to Wednesday's 80 per cent rise in first
half pre-tax profits.
AMSTERDAM was quiet for much of the day before late selling left the CBS
Tendency index 0.90 lower at 106.80.
Aegon, the insurer, slid Fl 1.40 to Fl 87.40 ahead of results. After the
bourse closed, these showed a 10 per cent rise in operating net profit, at
the upper end of analysts' expectations.
Nedlloyd, the shipping group, fell throughout the day, ending Fl 2.20 or 7
per cent lower at Fl 28.90. The shares had risen earlier in the week on
rumours of large investors building stakes but these have now been
discounted.
STOCKHOLM, waiting to see what support the government would receive in a key
parliamentary vote today, turned in an unexpectedly strong performance and
the Affarsvarlden index rose 4.7 to 999.2. Ericsson B added SKr9 to SKr278
on news of a SKr2.2bn order from China.
VIENNA dropped another 1.2 per cent in thin trade, the ATX index ending 9.21
lower at 769.49. ISTANBUL, on the other hand, climbed another 3.5 per cent,
the market index rising 206.69 to 6,070.86 for a four day gain of 7.3 per
cent .

FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei surges 2.7% to
year's high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average shot up by 2.7 per cent yesterday, led by a sharp rise in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
said that the supplementary budget to be approved in 11 days' time would
exceed last August's Y10,700bn package, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Volume totalled 620m shares, against Wednesday's 697m, with the Nikkei
gaining 507.64 at a closing peak for the year of 19,099.09 on heavy buying
by individual investors and dealers. It registered a day's low of 18,526.65
in the morning, before advancing to a high for the session of 19,135.83 just
before the close.
Rises outscored declines by 663 to 377, with 134 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks jumped 39.32 to 1,471.19, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.01 at 1,160.40.
Speculation that the supplementary budget will focus on upgrading the
country's telecommunications infrastructure boosted telecoms stocks,
including NTT, which rose by its daily limit of Y100,000 to Y977,000.
Expectations that the government may pass an additional budget in the autumn
also encouraged investors.
Cable companies were active on buying encouraged by NTT's rise. Furukawa
Electric, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y82 to Y730 and
Fujikura climbed Y100to Y945.
Rumours that Saudi Arabia was considering the acquisition of a Japanese oil
company prompted large buying of oil-related issues. Nippon Oil gained Y29
at Y749 and Mitsubishi Oil Y100 at Y984.
Electric power companies, which rely on oil imports, surged on the dollar's
fall against the yen. The US currency finished Y0.81 lower at Y114.54. Tokyo
Electric Power moved ahead Y340 to Y3,670 and Kyushu Electric Power ended
Y240 stronger at Y2,860.
The dollar, however, hit some high-technology exporters, with Matsushita
Electric Industrial losing Y40 to Y1,220 and Sony Y30 to Y4,400.
Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y45 to Y800 on higher gold bullion prices. Mitsui
Mining and Smelting was also strong, adding Y12 at Y510.
Companies linked with the Japan Railway Group rose ahead of JR East's
listing, expected this autumn. Totetsu Kogyo appreciated Y190 to Y1,250 and
Tokyu Car Y100 to Y725.
Nippon Paper, the new paper company resulting from the merger between Jujo
Paper and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp, forged ahead Y69 to Y545 on its first day of
trading.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 167.33 to 20,307.44 in volume of 27.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE REGION offered little concrete response to the strength of Tokyo.
AUSTRALIA picked up late in the session, helped by Tokyo and the emergence
of arbitrage trading in futures, but the All Ordinaries index closed only
1.4 higher at 1,668.8 in turn-over of ADollars 317.7m.
Gold shares provided a strong feature, the sector index climbing 16.8 to
1,255.2.
HONG KONG was cautious as the Sino-British row on the colony's future
simmered on but shares still moved ahead.
The Hang Seng index closed 20.02 up at 6,408.88, having hit 6,427.08 in
early trading. However, turnover shrank from HKDollars 3.19bn to HKDollars
2.93bn.
BANGKOK gave up almost all of the gains of the previous session.
The SET index retreated 13.46, or 1.56 per cent, to 851.77 as investors
became concerned at the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle following
criticism from within the ruling coalition that the government has achieved
little in its first six months in power.
KUALA LUMPUR was in more confident mood after its recent consolidation and
the composite index moved ahead 6.31 to end at a year's high of 649.56 in
active trading.

FT  02 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar tumbles in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell through the psychologically important level of DM1.60
against the D-Mark yesterday following the release of a very disappointing
set of US economic indicators, writes James Blitz.
The US currency bottomed out in London at DM1.5958 and later recovered a
little to close at DM1.5995, more than 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day.
It weakened sharply again in the US, however, dropping back to finish at
DM1.5920.
The dollar also hit another all-time low against the Japanese yen, with the
new record standing last night at Y113.70. The US currency later finished at
Y114.05 from a previous close of Y114.90. In New York it ended at the
Y114.05 level.
The decline of the US currency was exacerbated yesterday by poorer than
expected weekly jobless figures, which rose 380,000 when the market had been
expecting an increase in unemployment of 347,000.
These were seen as a bad omen for today's non-farm payroll figure for March,
the most important indicator in the dollar market.
A weaker than expected indicator from the National Association of Purchasing
Managers also depressed sentiment towards the dollar. The market had been
expecting the overall index to be 54 per cent but it was slightly weaker at
53.4 per cent. A weaker than expected payroll index - down to 46.9 per cent
from a previous 48.7 per cent - again depressed sentiment about today's main
indicator.
An additional factor weakening the US currency yesterday was the
Bundesbank's decision not to change its officially posted interest rates at
its weekly council meeting.
There had been few expectations of a cut in the Bundesbank's rates, since
the discount rate was reduced only two weeks ago. Nevertheless, yesterday's
was the last Bundesbank council meeting for three weeks, and this helped to
dampen sentiment.
Dealers remain concerned by a differential between official US and German
short-term interest rates that is still close to 5 percentage points.
In spite of the Bundesbank's decision, the pound rallied sharply against
both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday. The market continued to be swayed
by the governor of the Bank of England's comment on Wednesday that he was
seeking a stronger exchange rate for the currency.
Sterling closed 1 1/4 pfennigs up against the D-Mark at DM2.4400. Against
the weak dollar, the pound raced up to Dollars 1.5255, a net gain of two
cents on the day. In New York the pound was even stronger, closing at
Dollars 1.5300.
The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark following the Bank of
France's decision not to cut interest rates. The franc closed at FFr3.393
from a previous FFr3.396.
However, the lira again suffered a collapse, closing sharply weaker against
the D-Mark at L995.1 from a previous L989.7.

FT  02 APR 93 / Money Markets: Lombard unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell back sharply yesterday after the
Bundesbank decided to leave its official rates unchanged, writes James
Blitz.
Most money market dealers had expected that there would be no change in the
Bundesbank's official rates yesterday. The discount rate, which sets the
floor for all money market rates, was some 74 basis points below call money
yesterday, making another cut impossible.
There had been some expectation of a lowering of the Lombard rate, currently
at 9.00 per cent. But this sets the ceiling for money market rates, and
policy is clearly being eased - so dealers were mainly unperturbed by the
fact that this had been left unchanged.
Nevertheless, there are now three weeks between now and the next Bundesbank
council meeting and that clouded the atmosphere yesterday after-noon.
The June Euromark contract fell 9 basis points from its opening level to
close at 92.76, while the September contract declined 7 basis points to
93.63. Call money returned to a more normal level of 8.24 per cent,
following the very soft conditions that came on the very last day of March.
In contrast to Germany, there had been strong expectations of an official
rate reduction in France yesterday.
Both one-month and three-month French francs had fallen sharply in recent
days in the belief that Mr Edouard Balladur's new administration would take
the opportunity to ease policy in its first week in office.
However, guided perhaps by the knowledge that the Bundesbank would leave
policy unchanged later in the day, the Bank of France left its intervention
rate unaltered at 9.10 per cent. One-month money remained more or less
unchanged on the day at 10.20 per cent. The June French franc contract
slipped 3 basis points to finish at 91.53.
Sterling futures continued to fall, swayed by the governor of the Bank of
England's comment the previous day that he was seeking a stronger exchange
rate. The June contract closed at 94.17, down 3 basis points on the day.
Three-month money ended a touch firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, possibly due to
the very large shortage of Pounds 2.05bn forecast by the Bank of England.
The cost of overnight lending in the interbank market was as high as 7 per
cent at one stage.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Owls command presidential
attention - The Pacific Northwest ecological debate and the future of US
logging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes something out of the ordinary to get the US president, his
vice-president, five members of his Cabinet and a double fistful of other
senior officials to fly 3,000 miles across country from Washington to
Portland, Oregon, to sit in a room talking and listening for six hours.
The lure is America's oldest forests - and what inhabits them, including the
now notorious and endangered Northern Spotted Owl - and today's Forest
Conference, to be chaired by Mr Bill Clinton, is much more than the
redemption of a campaign promise.
It presages a substantial revolution in the way the federal government
manages the lands under its charge, above all with respect to the balance
between economic development and environmental protection. More narrowly, in
the Pacific Northwest, it is the beginning of preparation for the time when
there is even less prime timber to be cut and for the need to preserve a
viable salmon fishing industry.
The model for today's session is last December's Little Rock 'economic
summit' when the then president-elect held court for two days debating with
all and sundry about what ought to be done to set the economy right. This
time, however, only locals have been invited to take part, appropriately,
because there has been no more heated and divisive regional issue.
The trees versus owls 'train wreck' - as Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior
secretary, calls it - is a four-year long drama that reached its twin peaks
in 1990, when the spotted owl was officially declared an endangered species,
and in 1991 when a federal judge in effect banned most logging on federal
lands until the government came up with an acceptable plan to protect the
bird.
White House officials will not say precisely what they are contemplating,
but there is no doubt that past pro-industry policies will be broken. As one
member of the White House staff put it: 'In the Bush administration, there
were five or six agencies each with a horse hitched to a different side of
the cart. They couldn't figure out why the cart didn't go forward.'
Environmentalists are confident that, with Vice-President Al Gore now on
board, an ecologically friendly solution will be found. The timber industry
broadly agrees, but fears for the consequences.
Old growth forests, a national heritage in more ways than one, are those at
least 200 years old. The majority are on federal lands, 90 per cent have
already been logged, and an estimated 8m-9m acres now remain. About 30 per
cent of national output occurs in public and private old growth forests and
it is the highest quality timber.
Not only are they the habitat of the spotted owl, but their ecosystems have
helped sustain the region's important salmon fishing industry, employing
60,000 people a few years ago. Rivers and streams polluted by the timber
industry have reduced regional income from commercial and sport fishing by
80 per cent over the last four years.
Timber, still a Dollars 15bn a year industry, is less important than it was
to the Pacific Northwest. In 1970, 10 per cent of regional employment was
timber-related, but this is now closer to four per cent.
There are roughly half the number of sawmills of 25 years ago. But some
remote communities, with a distinctive way of life, are still almost
exclusively dependent on the industry.
In broad terms, the administration seems to be groping towards what might be
called a 'timber conversion' plan not unlike that now being contemplated for
the defence sector. This would permit some cutting in old growth forests,
but much more stringent protection of their ecosystems and species, combined
with financial assistance and retraining for displaced communities and
workers. As with defence it will not be cheap and it will be controversial.
There is some anecdotal evidence that both the environmentalists and the
industry are now less entrenched in their positions, having tentatively
reached the general conclusion that logging, like 19th century whaling in
New England, is an occupation whose prime has past. But it will require all
Mr Clinton's negotiating skills to find the right interim answers, however.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US debate on aid for Russia

<TEXT>
WHILE THE Clinton Administration was wrestling with plans to sell its
Russian aid programme to American voters, a House of Representatives
agriculture subcommittee has been holding a series of hearings on how to
structure an aid package to its former adversary.
'The issue is not how big a package, but how to put together a package that
goes where we want it to go,' said Ms Jane Shey, staff director of the house
subcommittee on foreign agriculture and hunger.
Concerns abound that aid would be diverted to the Russian Mafia, that US
investments will lead to an ultimate decrease of exports, and that they will
'go down a rat hole' in a system devoid of market forces.
Dr Philip Raup, a professor at the University of Minnesota, warned that
April, May and June will mark the period of greatest food shortages,
especially in grains.
'Even though grain purchased now will not arrive until May or June, at the
earliest, the knowledge that it is under way will enable Russian authorities
to draw down stocks to levels that might otherwise be dangerous,' he said.
Furthermore, the prospective arrival of grain imports could unblock internal
supplies being withheld by producers in the former Soviet Union in
anticipation of higher prices or more favorable barter trades.
Whatever doubts exist, the US must continue exporting to give the Russians
'a means to manage food supplies in the face of social discontent,' said Mr
Steven McCoy, president of the North American Export Grain Association.
Imports would not become a disincentive to output, he said, because of the
tremendous demand in the Russian market.
Dr Don Van Atta, a research associate at Duke University, said whatever aid
is sent, must not be 'dumped off' in Moscow.
'To be effective, American aid has to avoid much of the central political
turmoil, instead concentrating on individuals and voluntary organisations
which can rebuild something from the mess,' he said.
Dr Stephen Wegren, a political scientist, said the fact that commodity
exchanges were being set up in Russia provided 'the one shining light of
optimism because there are true market forces at work'.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Era of market support pacts for
commodities may be over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S VOTE against any renegotiation of the international rubber
agreement (Inra) and Wednesday's collapse of talks on a new international
coffee agreement appear to be the final nails in the coffin of those
commodity pacts which attempt to support market prices.
Only two weeks ago delegates to the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO)
abandoned their attempts to negotiate a pact based on a stock withholding
scheme. They are now planning an agreement described by one official as more
than purely administrative, but well short of a full economic accord.
Both the cocoa and coffee agreements have been moribund for several years.
Under the present agreement, which runs out in September, the ICCO was using
a buffer stock scheme in its attempts to shore up prices.
The system came to an end early in 1988 when the stock reached its maximum
permitted level of 250,000 tonnes. Members remain anxious to have some sort
of agreement put in place in order to avoid the threat to the market of any
sudden sale of the buffer stock, which still holds more than 230,000 tonnes
of cocoa.
The International Coffee Organisation was supporting prices through an
export quota system, but that collapsed in July 1989, sending world prices
crashing.
The latest London talks failed over a relatively minor point, indicating
that the gulf between producers and consumers has not narrowed in the
ensuing years. While the present agreement expires at the end of September,
it is possible that it could be extended by a further year.
The International Rubber Organisation announced yesterday that a majority of
its members, led by consumer countries, were against renegotiating their
pact, which expires at the end of the year. Consumers voted against because
they believe producers have failed to abide by the price review provisions
of the present agreement.
Inro will meet in May to consider the future of the agreement, but producers
have said they will oppose any extension without a decision to start
negotiations on a new pact.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that
the virtually simultaneous collapse of the coffee and rubber agreements
showed that there was no longer any will among G7 countries to give aid to
developing countries through price support systems.
Another observer said yesterday that the biggest change in attitude towards
commodity agreements was the realisation that, if the existing ones had not
worked, any established in future did not stand much chance of working
either.
'It has taken years for that message to sink home,' he said. 'People are now
wondering if they should bother with the bureaucracy, the expense, and the
effort.'
The last 10 days of talks at the ICO - one of many similar meetings over the
last 12 months - are believed to have cost around Pounds 500,000. But the
pace of the negotiations was always, in the memorable words of one delegate,
'like a snail on Mogadon.'
Nevertheless, the world coffee markets have had to keep one eye on the
endless rounds of negotiation. Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man,
the London trade house, said earlier this week that, even though the markets
always expected nothing positive to emerge from the ICO, they were
inevitably disappointed when nothing did so prices were marked down
accordingly.
Yesterday one London coffee trader said that the talks had been a deterrent
to trading.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soyabean price rally triggered
by planting plans
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT US soyabean farmers intend to plant 800,000 fewer acres than grain
analysts projected prompted a rally of 5 to 6 cents a bushel in Chicago
soyabean futures in early trading yesterday, while wheat and maize prices
also advanced.
The US Department of Agriculture in its quarterly survey of farmers' spring
plantings intentions estimated that 59.3m acres of soyabeans would be sowed
this year, down from 59.33m last year, and well below trade expectations of
60m.
The report also surprised wheat traders. It said record hard red spring
wheat plantings of 18.96m acres are expected, above the 18.7m planted in
1992, but below trade estimates of 19m.
Wheat prices gained 2 cents per bushel in early Chicago trading in response
to the news. Spring wheat, which is high in protein, is often exported to
the EC for bread baking.
Plantings of durum, another variety of spring-planted wheat, were projected
at a record low 2.09m acres, down nearly 500,000 from 1992.
Although maize plantings were estimated nearly 1m acres above industry
projections, at 76.49m, maize futures prices also managed a slight gain,
carried along by the soyabean and wheat rallies.
Mr. Victor Lespinasse, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago,
said the wheat data were particularly encouraging.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian vegetable oil exports
set to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA - until a few years ago a big importer of vegetable oils - may decide
to allow exports following a bumper oilseeds crop.
The country already exports minor oils. Sales of them are expected to be
about 8,000 tonnes, worth Rs300m (USDollars 9.6m), in the fiscal year ending
March 31.
An oil surplus of over 500,000 tonnes is expected after meeting the domestic
requirement of nearly 7m tonnes, making the export of major oils like
soyabean, sunflower and groundnut seem likely.
The record combined summer and winter oilseeds production of 21.6m tonnes,
compared with 19.5m tonnes last year, will enable the country to earn
Rs13.62bn from the export of oilmeals, oilseeds and minor oils.
India has achieved self-reliance in oils at a low level of per capita
consumption of 6.8 kg, compared with the world average of about 15 kg.
India has the option to import 300,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia but
the government has announced that India will not be importing oils in the
current 'oil year' which began in November 1992. At the same time prices of
all types of oils have fallen sharply because of the comfortable supply
situation.
The breakthrough in oilseeds production in India has come about following
the constitution of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO) in 1986 with
the mandate to provide modern technology, inputs and services to the 7m
farmers who mostly have small holdings.
TMO also has to contend with the fact that nearly 80 per cent of the 24m
hectares of land under oilseeds depends on rain. In this situation, the
small farmers could avail themselves of the 'critical farm services and
inputs' either by becoming members of co-operatives or by doing contract
farming for corporations.
While the co-operative movement has taken deep roots in the oilseeds
economy, ITC, an associate of British American Tobacco, has created a model
for other corporations by producing hybrid oilseeds, conducting farm
extension services, guaranteeing the off-take of seeds from farmers at
remunerative prices and operating an oil refinery.
To ITC goes the credit for popularising sunflower cultivation in Andhra
Pradesh and Karnataka. The government, meanwhile, has helped sustain
farmers' interest in oilseeds cultivation through its market intervention
operation.

FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brent oil price edges up to
Dollars 19.15 a barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT OIL prices broke out of their trading range on London's International
Petroleum Exchange to close above Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday.
The move followed news that production by the 12 members of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries was around 24.3m barrels a day. While this
is 700,000 b/d higher than Opec's self-imposed production quota, traders
said the figures were enough to give the price a slight boost.
The Brent June contract closed at Dollars 19.15 a barrel, up 21 cents on the
day. The May gas oil contract was Dollars 2 ahead at Dollars 175 a tonne.
'Products are well supported and the news for crude is not disastrous,' said
one trader. 'The market is creeping up.'
The market showed strength from the outset, moving out of last fortnight's
range between Dollars 18.55 and Dollars 18.90. Traders suggested the move
would continue next week if the market holds the Dollars 19 level today.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney, said the market
appeared to be 'prepared to disregard the fundamentals and go higher.' If
the Brent May contract reached Dollars 19.25, the market would move up to
Dollars 19.50, he suggested.

GOLD and precious metals were generally easier on the London bullion market
on light profit-taking after Wednesday's rush of excitement. Charts indicate
that the time is right for gold to break out into a higher range, possibly
with an upside target of Dollars 344 a troy ounce, according to dealers.
'But there will be a lot of resistance,' said one. Heavy overhead supplies
are still a factor, but the ease with which the market absorbed sales has
been impressive. BASE METALS mostly remained steady on the LME, with
stability in dollar contracts reflecting the weakness of the dollar in
currency markets. Three-month ZINC remained boxed in a Dollars 5 range with
an earlier move down to four-week lows of Dollars 995 a tonne finding
expected support. The subsequent recovery failed seriously to test
resistance above Dollars 1,000. COPPER was bolstered by its ability to hold
above Dollars 2,160 support. London's robusta COFFEE futures ended with
severely pared gains after a short covering rally which followed the
breakdown of ICO talks on Wednesday was seen to be overdone.

FT  02 APR 93 / The Property Market: Comeback kid against the wall -
Developer William Stern was once the UK's biggest bankrupt. He has bounced
back but today his companies are again under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Stern, the property dealer who shot to fame in the 1970s as
Britain's biggest bankrupt, is on the ropes again. Having clawed his way
back from his record Pounds 118m bankruptcy in 1978, the Hungarian emigre
has, once more, been trying to fend off his company's creditors.
Two subsidiaries of Dollar Land Holdings (DLH), the property company managed
by Mr Stern, have gone into liquidation, the most recent in February. And
Customs &amp; Excise, which earlier threatened nine DLH subsidiaries with
winding up orders, has given DLH until the end of June to pay its value
added tax arrears.
Despite this Mr Stern is sanguine about his business prospects. The most
remarkable aspect of his company, he says, is its resilience. He believes it
made a profit in 1992 and maintained its net asset value of Pounds 24.4m
recorded at end-1991.
The UK interest rate cuts since last autumn have eased DLH's cash-flow
problems of the past two years. Rents now cover interest costs, leaving
trading profits to pay the Pounds 5m backlog of debts, he says.
Mr Stern blames the fate of Dollar Land Management (DLM), a subsidiary which
went into liquidation last month, on 'unthinking action by Customs &amp;
Excise'. Although the parent company subsequently reached agreement with
Customs &amp; Excise about the payment of DLM's debts to the tax authorities,
for legal reasons the parent was prevented from continuing to support its
subsidiary after the publication of the winding-up petition.
Today, it seems that Mr Stern is less concerned about the failure of Dollar
Land Management (DLM) than about some inaccurate press reports claiming that
DLM's liquidator was investigating wrongful trading and the misappropriation
of funds owed to the tax authorities.
The liquidator, Mr Jonathan Schapira of Leonard Curtis, has indeed been
asked by creditors to examine the possibility of wrongful trading, but he
views this as a standard procedure in cases like these.
'I have been terribly careful to keep on the right side of the law,' says Mr
Stern. 'I have had an up and down business career but one thing I pride
myself on is that never has a question had to be asked by an official body.'
That was not for want of scrutiny. In 1977, a government inquiry into the
Pounds 200m property losses of the Crown Agents, to which he owed Pounds
40m, took an interest in Mr Stern's deals. And when, in 1983, he applied to
have his bankruptcy discharged, his lavish lifestyle, business conduct and
commercial morality all underwent close examination by the courts, the press
and creditors.
In particular, his creditors were incensed that Mr Stern sold his house and
its contents to his father Edmund in 1974, putting it beyond the reach of
his creditors when he was declared bankrupt.
After his bankruptcy, Mr Stern moved to the US to work as a consultant,
leaving behind what he believes is the widespread British social stigma that
attaches to bankrupts. However, when his bankruptcy was annulled in 1985,
family ties drew him back to the UK.
Then, as now, Mr Stern appeared undaunted by his business failure. He claims
he was a victim of circumstances when his property empire collapsed in 1974,
a crash he views as far deeper than the current downturn. 'It was totally
unavoidable,' he said. 'You couldn't give away property for love or money.'
Mr Stern was, certainly, not unusual in succumbing to the economic malaise
that engulfed the UK in the mid-1970s. 'It is, in fact, a very ordinary
bankruptcy but with noughts on the rent,' the Official Receiver said at the
time of the crash of the Wilstar Group, Mr Stern's company.
For all that, Wilstar's collapse can clearly be blamed on its financial
strategy. It was an exponent of deficit financing: it bought property that
did not yield enough rent to service the loan raised on it, in the belief
that values would continue to rise. The risks of this approach were laid
bare when interest rates rose in November 1973 and the market nose-dived.
Mr Stern says he has learned from the mistakes of the early 1970s. 'Since I
suffered heavily in the 1974 financial crash, I decided to build Dollar Land
on a non-speculative basis,' he says. In practice that meant avoiding
residential and development property that dominated his ill-starred
portfolio of the early 1970s.
Instead he concentrated on high-yielding buildings with strong tenants,
generally outside the south of England; a quarter of the assets are in
Belgium, France, Portugal and Holland. 'It is a very risk-adverse
portfolio,' he says.
This assessment is questionable. The group's borrowings of Pounds 167.5m,
which corresponded to a gearing of 84 per cent at end-1991, were not fixed,
leaving it vulnerable to rising interest rates. The group was dependent on
trading profits to cover its costs. At end-1991, rents of Pounds 13.5m
compared with financing charges of Pounds 23.7m.
But Mr Stern argues that high borrowings were inevitable if the group was to
build itself up from its near-standing start in 1985.
He began with Pounds 5m of equity in 1985 from his US backers. Despite
having a 24.5 per cent share in the business, he is not a director of Dollar
Land Holdings, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of the Panamanian-based
Keristal Investment and Trading. 'Because I had a problematic background
they (the backers) did not want me on the main board,' he says.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Mr Stern's comeback was his ability to
raise new loans. He has borrowed from a dozen banks and building societies,
principally GE Capital which has lent the business Pounds 70m.
Mr Stern attributes his ability to borrow to his contacts dating back to the
early 1970s. 'Notwithstanding the insolvency, I had forged a number of
relationships with bankers who knew my word was my bond and who valued my
know-how.'
He maintains, surprisingly, that his bankers valued his commitment to
repaying his loans and his unwillingness to abandon a project. 'I have
always looked a storm in the eye.' This attitude sits oddly with the events
of the early-1970s when the Pounds 80m of personal guarantees he gave proved
to be valueless.
Sir Kenneth Cork, who liquidated Mr Stern's empire in the mid-1970s,
maintained that the developer 'was convinced he was a genius whose flair for
finance would never let him down. Moreover he successfully convinced others
to share that opinion.' After Mr Stern's latest come-back, that assessment
still seems valid today.

FT  02 APR 93 / Government Bonds: German paper weakens after Bundesbank
disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to leave the key German interest rates unchanged
after yesterday's council meeting proved a big disappointment for the German
government bond market and bund prices ended the day weaker.
Dealers said that even the release of poor industrial production figures
yesterday did nothing to revive the bund market.
'A lot of people had been hoping for a cut in the Lombard and discount rates
and there was a lot of disappointment,' said one trader.
The DTB June long bund future fell to 95.07 by late afternoon from 95.47 in
the morning and against its previous close of 95.38.
Separately, the Bundesbank said it would increase the issue of 7 1/8 per
cent bonds due 2002 by DM2bn bringing the total size of the issue up to
DM16bn.
UK government bonds continued their post-auction rally yesterday morning but
fell back later in the day on profit-taking, ending up to a quarter of a
point lower.
The rally followed a better-than-expected auction of Pounds 3bn of 20-year
stock on Wednesday, and enabled the Bank of England to sell a further Pounds
600m tranche of 10-year stock.
The Bank supplied Pounds 600m of 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003, mostly
at 52 7/32 only a few hours after the tranche was made available to the
market. The June long gilt futures settled  5/16 down at 106.04.
US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
despite a stronger-than-expected jobless claims report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/16 at 101
29/32 , yielding 6.969 per cent. At the short end of the market, however,
the two-year note was steady at 99 13/16 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
Prices opened mostly firmer, aided by the release of the weekly jobless
claims data, which showed a rise of 33,000 in the number of people claiming
state unemployment insurance.
The news initially buoyed sentiment, because it suggested that tomorrow's
employment report for March would show a similar weakness in the labour
market.
Longer-dated Treasuries, however, were unable to hang on to their gains.
Dealers said there were several factors behind the selling, including
concern about the weak dollar, which could revive inflationary pressures;
another rise in commodity prices; and an unwillingness among traders and
investors to take on too much inventory ahead of today's March employment
numbers.
With most of the selling concentrated at the long end of the market as
dealers unwound some yield curve-flattening trades, shorter-dated prices
held their ground.
ITALIAN government bonds closed lower, hit by the weak lira, political
worries, and heavy supply. However, despite the poor background, dealers
expressed relief that yesterday's auction of government bonds was fully
covered.
The net yield at the auction of 10-year Treasury fixed-rate bonds (BTPs)
rose to 11.56 per cent from 11.36 per cent previously and a total of
L2,500bn of bonds was sold.
The BTP future fell from 94.37 to 93.90 yesterday, as dealers said the
lira's weakness upset the market. The lira traded at 996.00 against the
D-Mark, from around 990.
DEALERS reported healthy demand at yesterday's auction of Spanish government
bonds, and bond prices ended the day little changed despite the new supply.
The Treasury sold a total of Pta1,100bn of three, five and 10-year bonds and
dealers said the relatively high cover - the ratio of bids to the amount
allocated - was seen as an encouraging sign for the market.
DENMARK was the top-performing government bond market last month, with a
return of 4.11 per cent in local currency terms, according to figures
compiled by J. P. Morgan Securities.
Danish bonds rallied in March as pressure on the kroner abated and the
Danish central bank was able to lower its key interest rates. France and
Spain ranked after Denmark with gains of 2.79 per cent and 2.12 per cent
respectively in March.
The French bond market took its cue from the strength of the franc against
the D-Mark in the wake of the conservative coalition's sweeping election
victory and hopes of an easing in monetary policy.
The Bank of Spain's cut in overnight interest rates helped to boost the
Spanish bond market.
Australia was the best-performing market in the first quarter with a return
of 7.29 per cent in local currency terms. For US-dollar based investors, UK
government bonds made the strongest gains, with a return of 6.9 per cent in
March.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Pilkington brings issue of
sterling warrant bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, yesterday brought the first sterling warrant
bond issue in six years, raising Pounds 95m to refinance its purchase last
month of the glass processing and distribution business of Heywood Williams.
The decision to issue bonds with equity warrants attached rather than
convertible bonds owed much to the high yield on Pilkington's shares, which
yesterday stood at around 6.4 per cent.
To attract investors into convertibles, issuers of the recent spate of
sterling convertible bonds have generally to offer a yield 3 per cent or
more higher than their equity yield. That would have made the financing
costs to Pilkington unattractive, according to one person close to the
issue.
The five-year bonds issued yesterday carry a coupon of 7 1/2 per cent and
were priced to yield 175 basis points over gilts. The warrants attached to
the bonds were issued with an exercise price of 120p - close to yesterday's
close of 116p - and can be converted into 78.2m Pilkington shares,
equivalent to around 10 per cent of the outstanding equity.
The high level of volatility in Pilkington's shares in recent months has
boosted the implied volatility levels used to value the equity warrants,
making them more valuable to investors. As a result, the premium associated
with the warrants amounted to Pounds 18.5m.
Under new UK accounting rules due to be introduced soon, such a premium can
be taken into shareholders funds. According to one analyst yesterday, this
would reduce Pilkington's gearing from 90 per cent to 74 per cent.
The bonds and warrants, which will be traded separately or as a package,
were said by banks not involved in the deal to have met strong demand,
particularly from continental European investors.
Partly as a result of switching by investors, Pilkington's share price fell
back to 116p yesterday, from 125p at the beginning of the day.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Bonds: Latin American borrowers raise Dollars
and D-Mark funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of Latin American borrowers tapped the international capital
markets yesterday, raising both dollar and D-Mark funds.
In the D-Mark sector, Venezuela launched a DM150m five-year issue, via
Commerzbank. The bonds carried a 10 1/4 per cent coupon which proved
attractive to European retail investors, as well as specialist Latin
American fund managers.
The double-digit coupon and wide spread of more than 400 basis points over
the five-year bund yield was seen as sufficient compensation for buying what
is currently viewed as a very risky credit.
The uncertain political situation in Venezuela, ahead of elections at the
end of the year, has caused substantial volatility in Venezuela's par bonds
which are now trading at less than 60 cents in the dollar.
Also in D-Marks, the Inter-American Development Bank launched a 10-year deal
priced to yield 13 basis points over the comparable Bund yield.
The deal, arranged by Deutsche Bank, met some demand in the Far East, as
Japanese investors returned to the market at the start of their new fiscal
year.
Meanwhile, Uruguay is expected to launch its second Eurobond issue today,
following its return to the market last year.
The five-year deal, arranged by Chase, is expected to total Dollars 75m, but
could be increased to Dollars 100m.
The price talk is for a launch spread of 220 to 230 basis points above the
five-year US Treasury yield, a more aggressive pricing than had been
suggested when the deal was first mandated, but several dealers reported
demand at that level.
Meanwhile, a Dollars 130m five-year issue for Controladora Comercial
Mexicana, a Mexican retailer, arranged by Citibank, met strong demand.
Dealers said the spread of 370 basis points over the five-year Treasury
yield appeared generous, and the deal was oversubscribed.
Also in the sector, Argentina's Banco Medefin launched a small Dollars 30m
one-year deal, via Credit Lyonnais.
In the Australian dollar market, Shell Australia launched the first issue
since the Labor party's recent election victory. The Dollars 100m five-year
deal was arranged by Hambros Bank.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Stock lending business
benefits from tax ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AMENDMENT to tax regulations aimed at keeping international stock lending
business in London was announced yesterday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury.
The ability to borrow stock is essential for financial houses whose trading
strategies involve them in selling securities they do not own, making it one
of the key services underpinning London's active international equity
market.
The business has been hindered by the tax treatment of so-called
'manufactured dividends' - dividends which are paid to the lender of stock.
These have been subjected to a withholding tax in the past, which cannot be
recovered by an overseas lender which has no UK tax liability against which
to offset the charge.
Following discussions between the Inland Revenue and the City's Stock
Borrowing and Lending Committee, headed by Mr Ian Plenderleith, a director
of the Bank of England, such dividends will now be paid gross to overseas
lenders, it was announced. A similar ruling on the payment of dividends to
UK-based lenders was made two years ago.
The restriction that overseas stock can only pass through one intermediary
between borrower and lender is to be lifted, and a wider range of market
participants will be authorised to borrow stock, rather than just the
marketmakers and 'quasi-marketmakers' who are currently recognised. The new
rules apply only to overseas securities.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Hyundai shipyard weathers bleak
forecasts - John Burton visits HHI shipbuilders in Ulsan during a period of
structural transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The frantic activity at Hyundai Heavy Industries' shipbuilding yard in Ulsan
appears to belie a recent forecast by the Federation of Korean Industries
that shipbuilders face the bleakest future among the nation's main
businesses this year.
The FKI cited an excessive supply of ships and a downturn in the global
shipping industry to support its prediction of a slowdown in orders.
Although the ships being built by Hyundai Heavy Industries at the world's
largest shipyard were ordered during the past few years, its officials
believe that new orders will be able to keep its seven dry docks occupied.
'We are expecting good years in both 1994 and 1995,' says Mr K. H. Lee of
the ship sales department.
Orders fell to Dollars 750m last year from Dollars 3.1bn in 1991. 'We regard
last year and this year as a period of structural transition that will lead
to a recovery in the mid-1990s,' Mr Lee adds.
One reason for the optimism is that HHI is shifting toward the production of
more advanced and profitable vessels, such as gas carriers and large
container ships, while reducing its dependence on tankers and bulk carriers.
It plans to build passenger cruise ships within the next few years.
It launched its first liquefied natural gas carrier in February and the
vessel will be delivered next March to Hyundai Merchant Marine, a sister
subsidiary in the Hyundai group. A second LNG vessel is being built for
Yukong Line, a Korean shipping company.
This follows the construction of 13 liquefied petroleum gas carriers since
1986, with four more on order.
HHI expects to deliver 34 ships with a total value of Dollars 1.9bn this
year, against 26 vessels worth Dollars 1.7bn in 1992. The company has built
530 ships since 1973, when the Ulsan yards were opened.
HHI has reported a significant improvement in earnings in the past two
years, making it the most profitable unit among the 41 companies in the
Hyundai industrial group.
Profits reached Won281.2bn (Dollars 239m) on estimated sales of Won2,400bn
last year having climbed from Won33.9bn in 1990 to Won206.7bn in 1991. It
has set a sales target of Won3,250bn for 1993.
The higher profits reflect a cessation of labour strife that convulsed the
yard between 1987 and 1990, when it was a centre of the country's trade
union movement that emerged after the downfall of the military dictatorship.
The absence of industrial action since 1990 has led to an increase in
productivity among the company's 22,000 workers.
Privately-held HHI is eligible for a listing on the Seoul stock market since
it has reported at least three successive years of profits, a condition for
a public offering in Korea.
State approval for a Won270bn share issue, which was requested in September,
has been delayed because HHI has become embroiled in a political dispute
between the government and Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai
conglomerate, after he unsuccessfully stood for president last year.
HHI has been accused by the government of providing illegal campaign funds
for Mr Chung's presidential campaign and Mr Choi Soo-il, HHI president, is
in prison awaiting a possible trial for his alleged role in the affair.
Hyundai claims the government is preventing HHI and other Hyundai companies
from directly tapping the equity market because of its hostility towards Mr
Chung.
HHI acknowledges that the threat posed by emerging shipbuilding nations,
such as China, is forcing it to reduce its dependence on ship construction.
While shipbuilding accounts for 60 per cent of sales and almost all of its
profits, according to analysts, HHI wants to reduce the sales ratio to 50
per cent by 1995 and 40 per cent by 2000.
Two thirds of its Dollars 350m capital investment budget this year is
devoted to expanding production in its three non-core sectors, including
industrial plants, engines and machinery, and offshore facilities.
Offshore business has been lifted by orders worth Dollars 1bn placed last
year by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India for platforms and
undersea pipelines and other sales in Canada and China.
The industrial plant division is expanding into environmental projects,
including the production of water sewage plants. The engine division is
developing a gas turbine engine that will be used in LNG ships and other
vessels.

<TEXT>
MARUTI Udyog, a vehicle-making joint venture between the Indian government
and Suzuki Motor of Japan, has reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Rs342m
(Dollars 11m) for 1992, down from Rs350m the year before, writes Shiraz
Sidhva in New Delhi.
The Indian government allowed the Japanese car maker to increase its stake
to 50 per cent last June from 40 per cent. Mr R. C. Bhargava, managing
director, said exports of the company's 800cc car fell to 14,595 vehicles
from 22,921 last year, largely because of the war in the former Yugoslavia
and the 40 per cent devaluation of the Italian lira. Foreign exchange
earnings fell to Dollars 56.7m from Dollars 92.2m.
Maruti Udyog plans to begin exporting to South America. Suzuki's export
strategy ensures that the Indian company is the only source for its 800cc
car, which is sold in Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and
Portugal.
Demand in India for the Maruti car expanded, with the company selling
126,854 vehicles in 1992 against 122,438 the year before.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Fletcher to sell 9% of its stake
in Canadian arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry group, is to sell 9 per cent of
its stake in Fletcher Challenge Canada for CDollars 190.8m (USDollars
151.7m), through a public offering of shares.
The move is part of FCL's debt reduction programme and will reduce its
shareholding in the Canadian subsidiary to 63 per cent.
FCL said a primary aim of the sale, however, was to avoid having to issue
120m of its own ordinary shares on July 16 when it was liable to convert
shares in Fletcher Challenge Investments, a Canadian subsidiary, into its
own.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said FCL wanted to avoid converting the
shares because this would dilute the value of its ordinary shares.
He said a group of Canadian underwriters, led by Wood Gundy, would buy 10.6m
A shares in Fletcher Challenge Canada. The group would offer the shares to
the public for CDollars 190.8m, or CDollars 18 a share, on an instalment
basis.
The purchase price would be paid to FCL in two instalments of CDollars
100.7m on April 28, and CDollars 90.1m on June 30 next year.
Mr Fletcher said the transaction would enhance shareholder value by
increasing asset backing per share.
FCL will earn a profit on the deal. The price of CDollars 18 a share
compares with CDollars 14.50 that FCL paid for the shares last year.
Analysts said the move accorded with FCL's objective of reducing its
exposure to the British Columbian forestry industry, although Mr Fletcher
emphasised its long-term commitment to the Canadian industry, and optimism
about its future.

KOOR Industries, Israel's largest industrial concern, has reported a 45 per
cent increase in 1992 net profits to Shk375m (Dollars 136m).
Faced with the threat of liquidation four years ago, Koor has undergone a
remarkable recovery, becoming one of Israel's most profitable industrial
companies.
The company, which has holdings in electronics, building supplies,
chemicals, steel and metals, food and trade, reported sales 7 per cent ahead
at Shk6.08bn.
During 1992, Koor repaid all its debts to the Israeli banks, several years
ahead of the schedule agreed within the framework of its debt restructuring
programme.
Mr Benjamin Gaon, president, said: 'Now, as a result of this achievement,
improved operating results, and increased shareholders' equity, our new
three-year development and investment plan is under way.
'We expect this year to bring an increase in sales, including greater
exports,' he added.

posted a net loss of 473m pesos (Dollars 19m) in 1992, slightly less than
the previous year's 491m pesos loss, Reuter reports from Manila.
The directors said the loss was due to weak demand for copper caused by the
global recession, low metal prices because of huge inventories worldwide and
rising costs.
Turnover fell to 2.8bn pesos from 4.2bn pesos, and the loss per share
emerged at 5.65 pesos compared with a loss of 5.87 pesos.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Tokyo bids farewell to the
barriers - The Industrial Bank of Japan celebrating broking reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese financial institutions were generally unmoved yesterday by the
formal start of reforms that will slowly dismantle the barriers between
brokers and bankers. At the Industrial Bank of Japan, however, the reaction
was altogether much more positive as it prepared to set up a new subsidiary,
likely to be known as IBJ Securities.
Having underwritten the first batch of Manchurian Railway Bonds in 1907, IBJ
has always seen itself as more than a bank, but financial laws were
rewritten after the Second World War, strictly limiting its role.
IBJ applauds the 1993 reforms partly for what they offer in the future, but
also because they restore the identity of the distant past.
Mr Susumu Takanohara, IBJ managing director, said that the introduction of
the Financial System Reform Act, which became law yesterday, gave the bank
'bright hopes' amid the gloom of financial market turmoil.
It also helped the bank to overcome a few embarrassing incidents from the
late 1980s, the so-called bubble era, when it cultivated customers,
including a famed stock speculator in Osaka, outside its normal range of
industrial contacts.
'We have been looking forward to this moment for a long time. We really are
very optimistic about our chances,' Mr Takanohara said.
He expects IBJ's experience in the Euromarkets and its traditional links to
two medium-sized brokers, Wako Securities and New Japan Securities, to give
it an advantage in developing its own domestic operations.
IBJ has yet to receive formal approval from the finance ministry for its new
subsidiary, but the bank is reported to be planning to capitalise IBJ
Securities at Y30bn (Dollars 259m) and to provide about 120 staff.
The numbers are far larger than the country's two other long-term credit
banks, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank, which are
also permitted to establish new subsidiaries.
LTCB said that the banks wanted access to the stock market, but the ministry
had only provided initial permission to underwrite and to deal in bonds. For
the indefinite future, they will not be able to handle stocks or to deal in
equity-linked bonds, although they will be able to underwrite these issues.
'Our original aim was to have a full menu of services for our customers, and
issuing stocks would have been an important service,' LTCB said.
The finance ministry has indicated that the restrictions will be reviewed
after 'two to three years,' although it has not guaranteed they will be
significantly eased.
Next year, leading commercial banks are supposed to be granted the same,
limited rights to open a securities subsidiary.
Tighter than expected restrictions were imposed on the banks at the request
of the securities industry, bruised by the collapse of stock prices during
the past three years.
The Nikkei average, which measures Tokyo stock prices, has recovered during
the course of the past three weeks, but most of the 14 largest brokers will
report a loss for the fiscal year just ended.
Under the new law, brokers are allowed into the trust banking business, and
the Big Four houses, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities,
and Yamaichi Securities, have plans for new subsidiaries.
Smaller brokers are unlikely to have the resources to expand. Most have
recently announced restructuring plans to trim their operations, and trust
banking is unlikely to bring quick profits.
The Big Four will be limited in their trust banking businesses. They will
have access to investment trusts, but not to special large-lot securities
trusts, so called tokkin funds, and special loan trusts in which public
funds are invested, effectively protecting the territory of the existing
trust banks. It is an important principle of reform that a balance be
maintained between new opportunities and old players.
Nikko, planning a subsidiary capitalised at about Y20bn and with 50
employees, is 'not very optimistic'. It expects the banking industry to gain
more from reform: 'The underwriting market will become very tough. We will
have to improve product development, and know-how. We can see the market
expanding, so there will be more opportunities, but also very severe
competition.'
The brokers' biggest concern is IBJ, which has links to a majority of
companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo exchange. Additional
competition will come from Norinchukin, the central agriculture bank,
handling funds from farmers and fishermen around the country.
It plans to open a securities company with a capital of about Y20bn and 40
employees, increasing to 70 or so after two years. 'We would like to do
everything we are allowed to do, such as underwriting, dealing and sales of
bonds,' Norinchukin said.
The bank too, like IBJ, wants to leave the bubble era behind, as it funded
the ailing Nippon Housing Loan, a home loan company turned property
speculator. Norinchukin has accepted an interest rate cut from 6 to 4.5 per
cent on its estimated exposure of Y157.9bn.
Bruises from the bubble era have limited the aspirations of Nippon Credit
Bank, the third long-term credit bank. It is overhauling three finance
affiliates whose bad loans are running at about 20 per cent of total
lending. The bank is entangled in the latest Tokyo political scandal.
It has modest plans for a new subsidiary with capital of about Y2bn and
about 10 employees.

UNION Bank of Finland and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's two leading
commercial banks, yesterday had their debt ratings cut by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the US ratings agency, as a result of the continuing crisis in the Finnish
economy.
S&amp;P lowered its senior ratings of both banks from BBB plus to BBB and their
subordinated debt ratings from BBB to BBB minus.
It said the decision reflected the impact of the weak Finnish economy on the
banks' asset quality and financial performance.
KOP suffered a FM3.7bn (Dollars 6.16m) loss in 1992, while Unitas, the
holding company for UBF, reported a FM2.7bn deficit.
'With the economy likely to remain depressed for a prolonged period, high
levels of credit write-offs and non-performing loans will persist into the
medium-term,' S&amp;P said.
It said that the Finnish parliament's strong commitment to supporting the
banking sector meant that the outlook for both KOP and UBF was now stable.

NET PROFITS for AP Moller, the shipping, shipbuilding and oil and gas group,
fell by 20 per cent last year to DKr1.53bn (Dollars 246m) from DKr1.92bn in
1991. Pre-tax profits also declined, from DKr2.78bn to Dkr2.29bn.
Group turnover, 85 per cent derived from shipping, was down from DKr23.69bn
to DKr23.04bn.
The group operates more than 150 vessels and several offshore drilling rigs.
The preliminary report described world markets at the start of 1993 as 'not
encouraging'. There were no indications earnings from shipping would be
better than in 1992.
Results from oil and gas production will depend on the price of oil, which
in the first quarter was about Dollars 18 a barrel, compared with an average
price of Dollars 19 in 1992.
The profits slide was caused by lower earnings by the shipping business,
Tankers &amp; Liners in Partnership, which reported a fall in net profits from
DKr1.05bn from Dkr1.51bn in 1991.
After allowing for transfers to the partnership from the twin parent
companies, D/S af 1912 and D/S Svendborg, the fall in profits was sharper,
from DKr1.26bn to DKr478m.
The Maersk Line container services achieved a better result than last year
but results for tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and offshore drilling
operations were unfavourable.
The report criticised owners of oil cargoes for failing to face up to their
responsibility for pollution spills.
Pre-tax profits in the oil and gas business, which produce oil and gas from
the North Sea through the Danish Underground Consortium, were down from
DKr808m to DKr853m on turnover which fell from DKr3.33bn to DKr3.30bn.
The dividends in the twin parent companies will remain unchanged.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Japan sends warning on attempted
coercion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission yesterday warned leading banks and brokers it
would closely monitor their entry into new business areas to ensure there
were no violations of anti-monopoly laws.
The FTC, issuing its first guidelines for the financial industry, warned
that banks must not use their influence with corporate clients to coerce
them to do business with a new securities subsidiary. The warning also
applies to brokers opening a trust banking subsidiary.
Commission officials and many brokers are concerned that leading banks will
be able to coax their customers to ensure the new subsidiaries will have a
steady stream of business, but it will be up to the FTC to distinguish
between coaxing and coercing.
The FTC said anti-monopoly laws would be violated if a parent bank provided
services to a customer on the understanding that the customer would use its
new broking subsidiary. Attempts to prevent a customer from doing business
with a competitor would be a violation.
The FTC is likely to demand information from banks and brokers establishing
subsidiaries to ensure that the structure complies with the financial reform
legislation.
The commission will have difficulty tracing informal links among Japanese
corporate groups which help determine choices. Some bank customers will feel
an obligation to shift bond business to a new subsidiary.

AMAX, the integrated US metals and mining company, announced yesterday that
it would omit its June quarterly dividend on its common shares.
The Amax board voted to omit the payout as a result of the impact which low
aluminum prices, and the prices of other metals, have had on corporate
earnings.
Mr Allen Born, chairman, said that the board acted prudently in order to
conserve cash and to improve financial flexibility. Amax in 1992 suffered an
operating loss of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 1.71 per share, on sales of
Dollars 3.7bn.
Mr Born has said that, with metals prices little improved, first quarter
results will also prove to be poor.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: American Airlines plans 900
temporary lay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, is planning to lay off
temporarily 500 pilots and 400 maintainance workers by the year-end.
This is the second announcement of pilot furloughs - that is, temporary
lay-offs - this week from the nation's leading airlines, and underlines the
gloom in the troubled sector in spite of signs of recovery in the US
economy.
On Monday, Delta Air Lines, the large Atlanta-based carrier, said it planned
to cut 600 pilot jobs.
News of the American cutbacks came from Mr Bob Crandall, the airline
company's chairman. The carrier added that it planned to start implementing
the job cuts in 'the next several months', and to have them completed by the
year-end.
Like Delta, American claims that the job reductions are necessitated by
plans to scale down its domestic flight capacity - a response to the
sluggish travel demand and lack of profitability on some routes.
The Dallas-based airline announced recently it intended to ground 28
wide-body jets, and said yesterday that by 1994 there should a net reduction
in its fleet (after taking account of new aircraft deliveries) of 14
aircraft from current levels.
It is less clear what the implications of the reduction will be for
American's flight attendants.
The company operates a scheme whereby these employees can voluntarily take
extended leaves of absence, and said it hoped this plan would reduce the
number of lay-offs on the flight attendants' side.
Earlier this year, American Airlines announced it was implementing a
transition plan to reduce the domestic flights operations and take the
airline out of particularly unprofitable markets, while building up
non-airline revenue sources, such as management services.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel invests Dollars 1bn in
chip plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the world's largest computer chip maker, plans to add a Dollars 1bn
expansion to its plant near Albuquerque, New Mexico.
It will be the largest single investment in a US computer chip factory.
The expansion will begin immediately and production is scheduled to start in
1995, creating up to 1,000 new jobs.
'This is our first billion-dollar factory, but it won't be our last,' said
Mr Gordon Moore, chairman. 'Chip factories are getting bigger and more
expensive as our manufacturing technologies continue to become more complex.
The entry fee to be a major player in the global semiconductor market of the
1990s is Dollars 1bn - payable in advance.'
For the past three years, Intel has invested more in new plants and
equipment than any other semiconductor company in the world, and more than
it had spent in the 22-year history of the company.
In 1993, the company will spend Dollars 1.6bn on new plants and equipment.
The company's US-based manufacturing work force will expand by approximately
18 per cent this year. The expansion calls for completion of 180,000 sq ft
of the existing building and a 1.3m sq ft addition. This will include
140,000 sq ft of Class 1 clean room, the ultra-clean area where computer
chips are actually made.
In the new part of the plant chips will be made on eight-inch diameter
wafers and the circuit lines on chips will be 0.40 microns in width, smaller
than at any other US chip plant. (One micron is approximately 1/100th of the
thickness of a human hair).
The New Mexico factory, which is Intel's largest wafer fabrication plant,
produces microprocessors, the brains of personal computers, and other
advanced logic chips. Intel employs 2,400 workers at the site, with several
hundred additional support staff working for Intel suppliers.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: US breaks financing records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD amounts of new debt and equity were raised in the US during the first
quarter of this year, as low domestic interest rates continued to fuel
corporate demand for capital.
Wall Street securities houses reaped the rewards of the capital markets
boom, with underwriting fees breaking the Dollars 2bn barrier for the first
time. According to Securities Data, the US information company that compiles
the data, Merrill Lynch was once again the busiest underwriter, followed by
Goldman Sachs and First Boston.
In total, a record Dollars 262bn in domestic financing was raised during the
first three months of this year, eclipsing the previous record of Dollars
222bn set in the opening quarter of 1992.
Records were broken in almost every underwriting category. A total of
Dollars 122bn in new straight corporate debt was issued during the period,
due primarily to the fact that optimism about the economy and surprise at
President Clinton's willingness to tackle the budget deficit kept interest
rates extremely low for most of the quarter.
In spite of a slow January, a record Dollars 11.5bn was raised through
initial public offerings of stock as companies continued to tap the equity
markets either for fresh capital, or to pay off older, more expensive debt.
Even the market for junk bonds soared during the quarter, with Dollars
14.1bn in new high-yielding, low-rated corporate debt issued, up almost 80
per cent on a year earlier and well ahead of the previous record set in the
second quarter of 1992. Low interest rates, investor enthusiasm for riskier
but higher yielding instruments, and a greater willingness among banks to
underwrite junk bonds, were the main factors behind the market's strength.
International bond and equity issuance also remained strong during the
quarter, with a record Dollars 114bn in stock and Eurobonds sold in the
period.
The two areas where records did not tumble was mortgage and asset-backed
debt issuance, which was hit by the desertion of institutional investors
concerned about pre-payment risk, and mergers and acquisitions activity,
which remained flat compared with a year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak has filed a suit against Sony, one of Japan's leading
electronics manufacturers, in a patent infringement dispute that could have
broad implications throughout the consumer electronics industry.
Kodak alleges that Sony's video cassette recorders, camcorders (video
cameras) and other audio and video recording products infringe a patent the
US company obtained in 1981 covering a new type of recording head for
magnetic recording devices.
Industry analysts say the same technology is widely used throughout the
consumer electronics industry. Kodak declined to comment on whether it has
granted patent licences to other manufacturers.
According to the complaint, filed in Texas, Kodak has been attempting to
reach a licensing agreement with Sony since the late 1980s. It is asking the
court to issue an injunction to prevent Sony from selling products in the US
that allegedly infringe its patent.
The US company is also seeking treble damages, although it does not specify
the amount, and has asked for a jury trial. Sony's sales in the US last year
were over Dollars 6bn, of which VCRs and video cameras represented a
significant portion. Sony America declined to comment on the suit.
The damages covered by the Kodak claim could be substantial, said Mr Jack
Kelly of Goldman Sachs. He said the suit against Sony might encourage other
manufacturers of recording equipment to seek licences from Kodak.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM Europe faces anxious time -
A novel experiment has yet to gain approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European operations of International Business Machines will come under
increasingly critical scrutiny in the next few months, as the troubled US
company's newly appointed chief executive maps out his recovery strategy.
Mr Louis Gerstner was quick to impress on senior foreign IBM managers in a
conference telephone call last Friday that he sees IBM as a worldwide,
rather than a US company.
Europe, together with the Middle East and Africa, is the computer
manufacturer's largest market with sales of Dollars 24.97bn last year
compared with Dollars 24.63bn for the US. Its ailing economies are a main
source of IBM's problems.
Operating profit was halved last year to Dollars 1.5bn compared with Dollars
3bn in 1991. After taking restructuring charges into account, the area
recorded an overall loss before tax of Dollars 1.7bn. The UK subsidiary with
pre-tax losses of Pounds 616m (Dollars 927m), was the company's worst
individual performer.
It costs 25 per cent to 30 per cent more to lay off a worker in Europe than
in the US, IBM reckons. Some 10,000 of the area's 90,000 jobs were scheduled
to go this year.
Mr Gerstner may well decide that thousands more are called for.
Mr Renato Riverso, head of IBM Europe, said this week: 'At the core of IBM's
interest is the development of the European market.' He was speaking before
travelling to the US for a first meeting with Mr Gerstner to discuss
European strategy.
IBM's own projections make gloomy reading. It says that European investment
in machinery and capital equipment, which includes computers, software and
peripherals, will fall by 2.1 per cent in 1993. The greatest fall will be in
Germany, where investment is expected to decline by 5.7 per cent, and in
Italy where the decline will be 4.4 per cent.
In France, a decline of 2.5 per cent is projected; the only bright spot in
Europe is the UK where IBM expects positive growth of 4.1 per cent. Mr
Riverso said that although he could not yet measure a difference he believed
that the strategy put in place by IBM UK management was taking effect: 'I am
sure that the UK will recover,' he said.
Operations in the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland were showing
profitable growth of some 30 per cent a year from a very low base, Mr
Riverso said, but little or no contribution could be expected from the
former Soviet Union where operations had been pared back after a series of
disappointments.
A plan to build about 40,000 school rooms equipped with personal computers
foundered when funds ran out after 1,250 school rooms had been completed.
The company broke even on that project but it is still awaiting the initial
payment on a Dollars 150m contract to build a computerised airline
reservation system for Aeroflot, the Russian airline.
'This is not an area on which we are focusing for immediate investment,' Mr
Riverso said.
In the past two years, IBM's European operations have undergone a
transformation from a megalithic, hierarchical organisation which 'moved
like an army' according to Mr Riverso, to a federation of small units
organised along a multiplicity of axes. Some deal with vertical industry
sectors such as finance, others with whole businesses such as personal
computers or computing services.
The company has been analysing manufacturing capacity and likely demand for
its products and concluded before the turn of the year that it had excess
capacity in semiconductors, mainframes and data storage products. Several
European plants were at risk of closure.
In the event, Europe is at the earliest stage of a novel experiment which
has yet to have Mr Gerstner's approval. Four of the company's best-known
manufacturing sites, Havant in the UK, Montpellier in France, Valencia in
Italy and Jarfalla in Sweden have been redesignated as industrial business
centres. They will continue to be owned and operated by IBM but will be
largely controlled by local management. They are to find new business
outside IBM and be designated as preferred suppliers to IBM's businesses.
Eventually, these IBCs may be sold, or become independent subsidiaries with
their own terms and conditions of employment, IBM said. However, the IBCs
must prove profitable or face closure.
IBM Havant, on the English south coast, manufactures small disk drives and
controllers, circuits and communications products. It has a distinctive
reputation, having twice been chosen as sole source for vital IBM
components.
Mr Ken Wilkie, newly-appointed chief executive, says he sees the change as
one of ownership and direction rather than an alternative to closure.
'I could not conceive of Havant being shut down,' he said yesterday. Havant
is still producing devices vital to IBM's product offerings. It is far
advanced, Mr Wilkie says, with negotiations which could lead it to
manufacture products for other companies. Jarfalla, a printer plant, is
selling a new print head it has developed to other companies
However, IBM Europe is moving ahead with schemes created before Mr
Gerstner's appointment and without any guarantee that the new chief
executive will find them acceptable. Mr Riverso says the plan is 'the right
direction' and 'a solid product'. But until Mr Gerstner announces his plans,
it will be an anxious time for IBM employees in Europe.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz poised to begin
manufacturing in US

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the Ger-man luxury car manufacturer, is likely to announce
next week that it is to make an important shift of strategy and start
manufacturing in the US, following the lead set by rival BMW.
Mercedes, the car division of Daimler-Benz, is due to hold a news conference
in the US on Monday at which analysts expect it to announce plans to build a
sporty, four-wheel drive vehicle in the US. The company yesterday declined
to comment.
Mr Helmut Werner, the Mercedes management board chairman, said two months
ago that a US plant 'was a high, high priority.
BMW broke ground last September for a new Dollars 400m plant in South
Carolina after a three-year world-wide search for a suitable manufacturing
site outside Germany. The plant is to produce a new model for both the US
and export markets.
The German companies want to manufacture in the US partly because of lower
production costs there than in Germany, partly to protect themselves against
currency swings, and partly to revive their fortunes in the US - the world's
largest car market.
Sales of German cars have been hit by tax changes, the arrival of Japanese
luxury car manufacturers and a revival in Detroit's competitiveness.
Analysts speculated yesterday that Mercedes intended to plump for North
Carolina as the site of its new plant.
The company's Freightliner subsidiary, the US market leader in heavy trucks,
already manufactures in the state, which is a favourite for German companies
with US subsidiaries.
Manufacturing in the US would hold risks for Mercedes. It is unclear whether
American buyers of the company's cars would regard their engineering and
construction quite so highly with a 'made in the US' tag on the vehicles,
rather than German origin.
However, car buyers have been demonstrating an increasing resistance to
paying the high prices demanded by Mercedes for German prestige.
Audi, the up-market division of Volkswagen, is due to decide later this year
on whether to build a North American plant.

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, is considering applying to have its
shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
'We are very interested,' Mr Francois Perroux, the group spokesman,
confirmed yesterday, but he did not expect a decision within the next few
weeks.
Mr Perroux said Nestle overcame the main obstacle three years ago, when it
began to publish accounts according to international accounting standards.
Its 1992 accounts will take an important step further towards US-style full
disclosure by publishing for the first time a breakdown of profits by
business segment.
Last week, when the group published its preliminary 1992 results, it
revealed it would submit a plan for simplifying its three-tier share
structure to the annual general meeting on May 27.
Under this scheme, both the participation certificates and the bearer shares
would be converted into registered shares.
'The board is convinced this measure will render Nestle shares even more
attractive to institutional investors,' the group said.
Mr Perroux said that the share structure simplification would also mean that
the group's two US deposit receipt programmes could be merged into one.
Many large European companies have become increasingly interested in foreign
share listings in recent years, as they anticipate their needs for capital
outstripping the capacity of local markets to provide it.
Earlier this week, Daimler-Benz of Germany said that it had reached
agreement with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that would lead to a
listing of its shares in New York later this year.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has also expressed interest.

ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceutical and chemicals group, yesterday reported in
a preliminary statement a 29 per cent rise in consolidated net earnings to
SFr1.9bn (Dollars 1.27bn) on revenues up 13 per cent to SFr12.9bn.
The net income figure comfortably exceeds the SFr1.5bn figure published by
Ciba earlier this week and SFr1.49bn from Sandoz last week.
Like their counterparts at Ciba and Sandoz, the directors of Roche have
proposed a dividend increase, of 32 per cent to SFr37 per share or dividend
right certificate.
Roche has substantial liquid reserves and the directors made clear that
'very good non-operational revenues' contributed to 'this gratifying
result'. But they also reported 'significant improvements' in operating
results.
The net income figure for last year was reached after a non-recurring charge
of SFr208m for future post-retirement healthcare benefits of employees in
the US. Cash flow rose 29 per cent to SFr2.9bn.

forecasts

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second biggest bank, yesterday became the last of
the country's 'big five' banks to report a healthy rise in profits for last
year.
Dresdner's total operating profits - which include a contribution from
own-account trading - rose by 13.1 per cent to DM2.81bn (Dollars 1.74bn), in
line with analysts' expectations.
The results follow a 7 per cent increase in Deutsche Bank's operating
profits, a 20 per cent increase at Commerzbank, and high rates of growth at
Bayerische Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank.
Mr Wolfgang Roller, who next month will step down as chief executive, said
that in the first two months of the current year profits were 'slightly
ahead' of the high level of January and February last year.
Mr Roller said provisions against bad and doubtful debts had increased
substantially over the course of the last year.
Dresdner's figures were driven by a 7.4 per cent increase in net interest
income which rose DM399m to DM5.79bn. Reflecting lively securities business,
net commission income climbed 16 per cent to DM2.3bn. Operating expenses
rose by 9.6 per cent.
Mr Roller said the bank reduced its loans to problem countries from DM5.5bn
in 1991 to DM4.5bn last year, with DM3.4bn provided for.
Provisions for loans to the former Soviet Union were increased from 80 per
cent to 90 per cent of the total.
Net earnings rose DM314m to DM966m, an increase of 48 per cent, of which
DM466m was transferred to reserves. This figure includes loan-loss
provisions against what the bank called 'the unsatisfactory risk situation
over the broad range of lending business'.
None of the banks give a figure for loan provisioning, as is allowed under
German accounting rules, but disclosure will have to be made in the current
year figures under a new European Community accounting directive.
Mr Roller said the clear priority for last year had been to increase
provisions over transfers to reserves and dividend payment: for that reason
the bank was paying an unchanged dividend of DM12 per share. Earlier this
week the bank announced a two-for-19 rights issue at DM350 per share, which
will raise DM1.4bn.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Gemina lifted by one-off gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEMINA, the Italian financial holding company controlled by Fiat, posted a
leap in profits at both parent company and group levels in the first six
months of the current 1992-93 financial year.
Group pre-tax profits jumped to L235.8bn (Dollars 147.8m) from L130.9bn,
while parent company pre-tax profits increased to L164.4bn from L30.8bn. The
rises derived from a number of one-off gains, notably the L226.1bn from the
sale of Gemina's 9.7 per cent stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto
(Ambroveneto).
However, Gemina set aside L64.6bn in extraordinary losses following the
write-down in value to recent stock market prices of its holdings in Pirelli
&amp; C, Burgo and Europa Metalli. These three stakes have been transferred to
the company's Gemina Investments investment banking subsidiary.
Gemina predicted full-year profits would be higher for both the group and
the parent company, thanks to the sharp increases at the interim stage and
other developments.
In 1991-92, Gemina reported group net earnings of L157bn while parent
company net profits fell sharply to L42.7bn, largely because of write-offs
on the company's share port-folio.
The sale of the Ambroveneto stake led to a L351.7bn fall in the value of
Gemina's holdings to L1,170.9bn at the end of last year.
Gemina been tipped as a possible investor in a consortium to buy Credito
Italiano, the state-owned bank now up for sale, but gave no indication of
investment plans linked to Italy's privatisation programme. However, its
cash pile stood at L378bn at the end of last year, leaving it well placed
for any future investment opportunities.

French banking

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is poised for
privatisation by France's new conservative government, saw net profits fall
by 26 per cent to FFr2.17bn (Dollars 396m) last year from FFr2.94bn in 1991,
reflecting the gloom in the French financial sector.
The bank is also cutting its dividend to FFr7.50 from FFr10.50.
BNP was affected by the general pressures on the French banking sector. Net
banking income rose by 5.2 per cent to FFr39.92bn from FFr37.93bn, with
operating profits up by 8.9 per cent to FFr11.81bn from FFr10.85bn over the
same period.
Mr Rene Thomas, chairman, said the group had been hit by the sluggish state
of the banking market and by the sharp increase in bank borrowing costs
towards the end of the year, when short-term interest rates escalated during
the Bank of France's battle to defend the franc.
However, the chief problem for the bank was the impact of the economic
slowdown on its property portfolio and also on its smaller corporate
clients.
The group raised net provisions to FFr8.38bn from FFr8.08bn in 1991.
It made new provisions of FFr10.14bn, but recouped FFr1.76bn of write-downs
made in previous years on loans to developing countries.

FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Eni draws up plans for Agip
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the Italian state energy and chemicals group which has been implicated
in the country's political corruption scandal, could raise up to L2,000bn
(Dollars 1.25bn) by floating its Agip petroleum subsidiary.
Details of the plan, presented to the treasury earlier this week, were
accompanied by news that Eni had sold two parts of its Savio textile
machinery subsidiary for about L150bn. The remaining Savio operations may be
sold by the end of the year.
Although Eni has given no indication of how much of Agip, its upstream oil
and gas operation, it intended to list, analysts predict the issue could
involve up to 20 per cent of the company.
Agip made net profits of L1,101bn on sales of L10,957bn in 1991.
Eni's plans to list some of its subsidiaries have involved a number of
merchant banks. While Swiss Bank Corporation and Lazard Freres have been
working on the Agip project, the plans to list Snam, Eni's natural gas
distribution arm, have been handled by Goldman Sachs and Paribas. It is
believed that SBC and Goldman Sachs will now be taking the Agip project
forward.
Italy's privatisation programme envisages the proceeds should go to the
government. However, some money may be diverted to Eni in view of growing
pressure on its earnings.
Group results for 1992 will not be released for some time. However, it is
believed that Eni will set aside about L500bn to cover job losses and
restructuring. Similar provisions are thought to be necessary this year.
Eni may also have to set aside a large, but so far unspecified, sum in its
1992 and 1993 accounts for extraordinary provisions linked to alleged bribes
and illegal party funding.
Large extraordinary allocations may also be necessary to cover write-downs
on fixed assets, according to a senior executive.
Floating Agip would end more than two years of uncertainty during which Eni
has studied listing both Agip and Snam. Last December, the government gave
Eni an end-March deadline to present plans for a share issue.
Having opted to list Agip, it is now up to the treasury to take the final
decision. Prospects for the deal have been overshadowed by the wider
political uncertainties facing the Amato government, which has made
privatisation one of its main policies.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rentals cushion Gleeson decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER RENTAL income helped MJ Gleeson, the Surrey-based construction,
housebuilding and property group, offset a 50 per cent drop in trading
profits and so restrict the decline in pre-tax profits to 19 per cent.
Profits decreased from Pounds 5.03m to Pounds 4.06m in the six months to
December 31, on turnover down from Pounds 87.6m to Pounds 80.2m.
Earnings per share declined 17 per cent to 27.09p (32.64p).
However, the interim dividend is maintained at 3.35p, reflecting the group's
'underlying financial strength.'
The group said the Pounds 7.43m decline in turnover was 'further evidence of
the already well-documented problems confronting the construction and
housebuilding sectors.'
Trading profits were halved from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.54m, but that was
cushioned by higher investment property income of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds
1.98m).
Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 763,000).
Looking ahead the group, which was one of the sector's better performing
organisations throughout the recession, said 'prospects for building and
civil engineering contracting remain poor.'
The family-run management said it was addressing the problem of surplus
capacity in the UK construction market through 'rationalisation and a
substantial reduction of overhead costs.'
In the housebuilding division work in progress was being rigorously
controlled.
On a more positive note the group said: 'There are clear signs of increased
interest among house buyers.
'If this trend is sustained, a satisfactory result will be achieved in the
current financial year.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although operating profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds
54,000 to Pounds 260,000, Thomas Jourdan incurred increased pre-tax losses
of Pounds 780,000 in 1992, against Pounds 519,000.
Losses were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 699,000 (Pounds
539,000) mainly relating to redundancies and surplus property costs.
Turnover for the group, which makes and markets consumer goods, including
trouser presses, fireplaces and furniture, came to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds
25.5m).
Most subsidiaries had traded profitably during the year, the directors said.
In view of a relatively encouraging start to this year and improvement from
continuing businesses, the recommended final dividend is 0.25p for a total
of 0.75p (1.5p). Losses per share were 4.35p (1.47p).

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Route into Europe is on the cards - Unigate
and its interests in continental expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Ross Buckland became chief executive of Unigate two-and-a-half years
ago, the sprawling group was described by one observer as 'a business which,
if it didn't exist, nobody would have wanted to invent.'
From its dairy industry roots, Unigate had spread into areas as varied as
trade exhibitions, US fast-food restaurants, car auctions, road freight and
large-scale poultry breeding.
The supposed logic for this diversification - a balanced earnings portfolio
 -was belied by an increasingly dismal profits performance.
Mr Buckland, an Australian who formerly headed the European operations of
Kellogg, the US breakfast cereals company, has worked hard to give a more
coherent shape to the group. Declaring food and distribution to be its core
businesses, he has set about shedding operations which were performing
poorly or had limited potential for development.
The loss-plagued JP Wood chicken subsidiary was acquired by Hillsdown
Holdings for Pounds 30m last year. Unigate's unprofitable contract car hire
business is being wound down, its US cheese unit has been sold, and its
American restaurant chain is being prepared for possible flotation on the US
stock market this summer. Further disposals are likely, Mr Buckland says.
Meanwhile, Unigate has hit the acquisition trail. A Pounds 17m bid for some
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk businesses in January was
followed by a Pounds 50.4m friendly offer for Clifford Foods, a
Berkshire-based dairy and juice company, and the Pounds 54m purchase of
Glass Glover, which operates warehouses and distribution for large UK
retailers.
This flurry of activity has yet to produce a convincing improvement in
pre-tax profits, which fell slightly in the first half of this year.
Nonetheless, the stock market seems to believe a corner of some sort has
been turned. After sliding steeply last summer, Unigate's share price has
rebounded since the autumn.
The Co-op and Clifford deals are expected to boost Unigate's profits in the
next couple of years by enabling it to use dairy capacity more efficiently.
The Glass Glover purchase, while generously priced, will broaden Unigate's
distribution franchise with big supermarket groups by adding warehouse
contracts.
It is much less clear, though, that Unigate has yet found a formula for
sustained longer-term growth. Though its distribution arm is regarded as
efficient and well-managed, warehouse management is a relatively mature
business which offers limited opportunities for scale economies.
The recent expansion of Unigate's liquid milk operations - which the group
spent the 1980s trying to de-emphasise - looks to most observers like a
defensive attempt to secure competitive position in a business which is a
handy source of cash.
UK liquid milk consumption has been declining steadily by a percentage point
a year, while doorstep deliveries are losing sales to supermarkets at a
considerably faster rate. Though Mr Buckland expects these trends to
stabilise in the next few years, he concedes that the profits outlook for
liquid milk is hardly electrifying.
So where will the growth come from? Mr Buckland says part of the answer lies
in moving Unigate's food-processing operations into higher value-added
areas. He points to the recent expansion of dairy desserts output and the
Pounds 15m invested in the past three years to double capacity and produce
more cooked meats at its Malton bacon factory, which has won back market
share from imports.
However, profits on these operations fell in the first half due to
recession, higher pig prices and increased marketing costs. Meanwhile, St
Ivel Gold, which pioneered the market for low-fat spreads and is the
company's biggest brand, has seen its sales stagnate and faces fierce price
competition.
Unigate's recent performance in yoghurt, another main product line, has also
been undistinguished. Since the late 1980s Muller, a small German dairy
company, has captured almost 20 per cent of the UK market by offering an
innovative range of yoghurts at premium prices. Muller is now the 26th
largest UK supermarket brand, well ahead of St Ivel Shape yoghurt.
Asked why Unigate allowed itself to be trounced on its home ground, Mr
Buckland throws up his hands and exclaims: 'Mea culpa] All of us in the UK
failed to make the right judgement. Muller was fundamentally not seen as a
threat by established yogurt producers. The consumer saw things differently
and said, l like Muller's products.'
Unigate is now making yogurts intended to match the German company's range.
Recently, Mr Buckland's horizons have begun to extend beyond the UK to
continental Europe. An important objective in re-shaping the dairy and
distribution businesses, he says, has been to build a domestic base solid
enough to support the risks inherent in overseas expansion.
He says Unigate is interested in pursuing continental joint ventures or
acquisitions of more than Pounds 50m. He sees particularly good
opportunities in private-label manufacturing, which he thinks is set to grow
rapidly as food retailers in Europe become steadily more powerful.
He would fund acquisitions by making further disposals, if necessary, to
avoid the need for a rights issue or a further increase in Unigate's
gearing, which stands at about 60 per cent.
One possible route to the continent lies through Nutricia, a Dutch babyfood
and clinical nutrition company of which Unigate owns a third. Unigate, which
acquired its original stake when it sold its Cow &amp; Gate division to Nutricia
in 1981, purchased further shares last year.
Mr Buckland, who sits on Nutricia's board, says relations with the Dutch
company have grown much closer recently, and both sides are interested in
strengthening their links further.
Could an eventual full takeover of Nutricia - which has a stock market
valuation of more than Pounds 400m - be on the cards?
Mr Buckland's answer is intriguingly equivocal. Unigate would never consider
a hostile bid, which could in any case be easily frustrated under Dutch
takeover rules. However, he also says: 'The relationship has not been
static. Don't be surprised if it doesn't remain static for the next 18
months.'

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish merchant bank seeks quotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUAYLE MUNRO, the small Edinburgh merchant bank, is to be quoted on the
Stock Exchange after a reverse takeover by East of Scotland Industrial
Investments, the unquoted investment company which it manages.
ESII has net worth of about Pounds 17m, of which Pounds 8.5m is in cash. The
deal involves repayment of about Pounds 10m of ESII's capital to its
shareholders, who are mainly institutions.
Existing Quayle Munro shareholders will end up owning 75 per cent of the
newly merged company, which will be called Quayle Munro Holdings. It will
seek a full listing immediately the transaction is completed in early June.
The new company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m.
No new shares will be issued.
Mr Ian Jones, who founded Quayle Munro in 1983 with Mr Michael Munro, will
be group chief executive. He said the transaction was a means of enabling
shareholders in ESII to realise their investment without suffering a
discount on net asset value.
The new company will be primarily a corporate finance adviser, though it
will also make occasional investments.
ESII has shares in two listed companies, Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal
company, and Secure Trust Group. It also has stakes in 16 unquoted
companies, such as Exacta Holdings, an electronics group, and Nevis Range
Development, which operates skiing facilities near Fort William in the
Scottish Highlands.
Quayle Munro has a number of corporate clients including Shanks &amp; McEwan and
Pittencrieff, the oil company.
It has also advised the Scottish Office on privatising the Scottish Bus
Group and on the future of the Scottish water industry.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prestwick Holdings, the printed circuit board manufacturer, raised pre-tax
profits by 31 per cent, from Pounds 81,000 to Pounds 106,000, in the half
year to January 31.
The two principal plants at Irvine and Ayr increased overall sales by 20 per
cent through expansion of the customer base. Exports from those units rose
68 per cent and 89 per cent across the group. Sales came to Pounds 18.1m
(Pounds 13.9m).
Additional operating profit earned from the increased sales was adversely
affected by development costs associated with new contracts, and disruption
costs caused by erratic delivery demands from some customers.
After the preference divided there were losses per share for the period of
0.02p (0.13p). The interim dividend is held at 0.5p.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: TLS reduces losses and pays dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TLS Range, the vehicle rental group trading in Scotland, the north-west and
the West Midlands, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 259,000 to Pounds
190,000 in 1992.
However, it was unable to offset losses incurred in the summer and could not
maintain the level of improvement recorded at halfway.
Turnover was static at Pounds 9.79m (Pounds 9.97m). The fleet size,
including contract hire vehicles, was reduced from 1,934 to 1,738 to take
account of falling market demand.
From January, the hire fleet will be depreciated equally over the period of
the estimated useful life, which will result in an overall average provision
of 16.8 per cent per annum of cost.
On the basis of an improving trading performance in the early part of the
current year, the group is returning to dividends with a final of 0.25p.
Losses per share came to 0.98p (1.25p).

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Investment trusts' concern over ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUST companies have been looking nervously over each others'
shoulders recently since the latest ruling from the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog.
Their concern follows a carefully-worded statement from the Panel on the
accounts to December 31 1991 of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust.
At issue were two points which have wider implications for other companies,
most notably quoted investment trusts: disclosure of the emoluments of the
directors of its investment management company, and the consolidation of
subsidiaries.
'As professional investors we live by information and so it is in our
interest to set high standards of financial reporting,' says Mr Eric Elstob,
joint managing director. 'We believe in maximum disclosure.'
The Panel's primary concern was that F&amp;C's 1991 annual report disclosed only
the emoluments for the chairman of Pounds 25,000, and for the six
non-executive directors of the parent, all in the Pounds 10,001-Pounds
15,000 range.
There was no disclosure of emoluments for the five executive directors of
Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, F&amp;C's investment manager, which is an
associate of one of the parent company's subsidiaries.
This reflects the peculiar nature of the investment trust industry. The
investment management company is not wholly owned by F&amp;C, and conducts work
for other investment trusts which - while they may carry the F&amp;C name - are
not subsidiaries but separate companies.
The review panel took the view that the proportion of remuneration by the
directors to the investment manager relating to services for F&amp;C and its
subsidiaries should nevertheless be shown in the accounts.
Mr Elstob said the figure was difficult to calculate, but the company has
made an attempt to allocate payment for the time spent. The 1992 accounts
show the restated directors' emoluments for 1991 as Pounds 195,000. That
includes - in addition to the figures shown the previous year - a seventh
director in the Pounds 10,001-Pounds 15,000 range; one in the Pounds
15,001-Pounds 20,000 range; two earning between Pounds 25,001 and Pounds
30,000, and Pounds 114,000 to the highest paid director.
The second issue of concern to the Panel was whether certain subsidiaries
should have been consolidated in the 1991 accounts. F&amp;C maintains that the
subsidiaries were not material, and their inclusion was therefore not
necessary.
The Panel has left its verdict ambiguous on the topic, but F&amp;C has decided
to consolidate these subsidiaries in the 1992 accounts, with a re-statement
for 1991.
There is no mention of the discussions with the Panel in the accounts, but
Poutney Hill Holdings, which owns 50 per cent of F&amp;C Management has now been
included in the consolidated balance sheet. Its consolidation during 1991
would have added just 0.1 per cent to net assets.
While the Panel's rulings only affect F&amp;C and do not set a wider precedent,
they do give a hint to other companies of the way in which UK accounting
thinking is evolving.

African Lakes, the mining, agriculture and motor trading group, said that
substantial losses in the UK offset another 'excellent' year in Malawi
despite a further devaluation.
As a result overall pre-tax profits for the 12 months to September 30 fell

6.48p), after minorities of Pounds 552,000 (Pounds 632,000).
The dividend, however, is maintained at 2p.
Directors said there were substantial losses in the UK motor operations.
Another significant deficit was incurred by Wave Computer Supplies
principally because of rationalisation, costs of setting up a new Irish
subsidiary and certain other items relating to the pre-acquisition period.

Great Southern, the USM-quoted funerals group, yesterday announced a 12 per
cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.24m. Turnover rose from Pounds
27.7m to Pounds 29.6m.
The shares improved 6p to 334p.
Mortality rates decreased by a further 8 per cent in London and by 6 per
cent in England and Wales during the past winter, significantly reducing the
overall number of funerals and cremations.
However, in spite of the decline the profits contribution of the core
division, funerals services, was slightly higher at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
4.44m) because of tight cost control and further added value to the
businesses.
A recommended final dividend of 7.4p (6.7p) makes an 11p (10p) total.
Earnings per share rose 2p to 24.4p.

<TEXT>
SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the steam equipment specialist, reported a slight
increase in profits, in spite of difficult conditions, but was downbeat
about this year's trading prospects.
The Cheltenham-based group, which makes 80 per cent of its sales outside the
UK, also announced the acquisition of its former licensee in Italy and an
initial 25 per cent stake in the group's Spanish licensee.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 23.1m in the year to
December 31, while sales improved 6 per cent from Pounds 158.3m to Pounds
168.4m.
The profit, compiled under FRS 3, was depressed by the disposal of the
Drayton domestic heating controls businesses for Pounds 5.4m. An exceptional
loss of Pounds 3.4m would have been taken below the line under the old
accountancy standard.
Speciality steam equipment maintained volume, while Watson-Marlow, the
peristaltic pump business, increased sales helped by the acquisition of its
US distributor.
Operating margins at both businesses were virtually maintained at 16.1 per
cent.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said while there were some signs of
improvement in North America, the prospects for continental Europe and much
of the Far East remained difficult to predict.
'In our business, which runs some way behind the cycle, we still see no
signs of any improvement.
The group has agreed to pay Pounds 13.4m for the industrial division of
Jucker, its former licensee in Italy, and to pay Pounds 1.1m for an initial
25 per cent stake in its Spanish licensee, Industrial Mas Nieto.
The agreement provides for an increase in this holding to 50 per cent in
1995 and 60 per cent five years later.
Earnings per share fell from 18p to 17.1p, partly because of the net
exceptional charge of Pounds 1.3m.
Adjusted to reflect the group's underlying operating performance before
exceptionals, earnings rose 4 per cent to 18.8p (18p). A proposed final
dividend of 6.6p makes 9.3p (9p) for the year.
COMMENT
Steam may not be glamorous, but Spirax-Sarco has quality products which give
it a strong presence in 25 countries. Having left the consumer market with
the Drayton disposals, the group continues its strategy of buying licensees,
with the Italian deal making it leader in Europe's third largest market.
Unfortunately the products tend to lag the cycle, and the group sees few
signs of recovery. Forecast profits of Pounds 27m put the shares, up 8p to
357p yesterday, on a multiple of about 17. In spite of the likely currency
benefits to come this year, they look fully valued at that level.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Atlas seeks Pounds 11m as profits dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATLAS Converting Equipment yesterday launched an Pounds 11m rights issue as
1992 pre-tax profits, eroded by soaring interest costs, fell from Pounds
6.67m to Pounds 5.03m.
Reduced volumes, a sharp increase in net interest charges to Pounds 495,000
(Pounds 70,000) and a disappointing result at its General Vacuum Equipment
subsidiary accounted for the sizeable part of the profits' decline,
explained Mr Chris Rogers, chairman. Turnover slipped to Pounds 46.4m
(Pounds 48.4m).
The 1-for-4 rights issue at 550p a share, underwritten by Hoare Govett, will
eliminate Pounds 8.6m of short-term borrowings and meet expenditures of, for
example, Pounds 1m on a manufacturing facilities at Hurley-Moat. The shares
closed unchanged at 690p.
Earnings fell to 41p (55.1p). A final dividend of 15p makes a 22p (21p)
total.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Next continues recovery with Pounds 38.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT, the fashion retailer which inspired a host of imitators in the early
1980s but ran into problems when it over-expanded, showed it was well on the
way to recovery yesterday by more than tripling pre-tax profits.
Profits for the year to January 31 rose from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 38.9m
and included an exceptional credit of Pounds 2.7m following a review of
unused provisions.
The shares gained 11p to 172p as the total dividend was raised from 0.75p to
2.5p with a proposed final of 2p.
Earnings per share also more than tripled, to 9.93p (3.08p).
Turnover increased from Pounds 462m to Pounds 485m. Sales in the high street
amounted to Pounds 333m (Pounds 282m) contributing operating profits of
Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 6.4m).
Turnover at the Next Directory mail order division rose to Pounds 90.8m
(Pounds 88.1m) and generated profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4m).
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said sales in the retail chain were up 24
per cent in the second half. The 18 per cent rise for the year came from 4
per cent less selling space.
On a like-for-like basis, sales showed an increase of 22.5 per cent.
The strong performance had continued into the current year, with sales of
the spring-summer collection up 12 per cent, on space down 2 per cent.
'I doubt if many other retailers could match that performance,' Mr Jones
said. He added that the figures should not be taken as a signal of a general
recovery in high street trading.
Other encouraging signs were that Club 24, Next's credit management
business, reduced its borrowings from Pounds 124m to Pounds 53m. This left
the group with net cash in hand of Pounds 12m, compared with borrowings of
Pounds 88m the year before. Only two years ago gearing was more than 300 per
cent.
Mr Jones said the improved performance was due to the closure of less
profitable stores, better use of space and displays, higher-quality
merchandise, and the refusal to discount except during two-week
end-of-season sales.
This helped annual sales per sq ft of selling space increase to Pounds 355 -
higher than most competitors apart from Marks and Spencer - compared with
Pounds 292 in 1991 and Pounds 253 in 1990.
Lord Wolfson, chairman, said that figure could improve to Pounds 450 or more
as further improvements in its range and customer service increased sales.
Most of the group's efforts in the medium-term would go into improving the
existing retail and mail order operations, rather than expansion or
diversification.
The company has now largely completed its store closure programme, leaving
it with 305 stores and a total of 937,000 sq ft of selling space.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: LWT advances 62% to Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR CHRISTOPHER Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), said LWT would see
significant growth in advertising revenue in the first quarter and that the
outlook for the rest of the year was 'encouraging'.
The optimistic forecast for 1993 came as Sir Christopher announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 30.6m for 1992, an increase of 62 per cent.
If FRS 3 had not been adopted profits would have increased by 27 per cent
year-on-year.
In what Sir Christopher described as 'an extremely good year' LWT increased
operating profit before Exchequer Levy by 6.8 per cent although advertising
revenue rose only 3.9 per cent.
The ITV company's profits were boosted by reduction in levy payments from
Pounds 16.8m in 1991 compared with Pounds 10.5m last year.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased 59 per cent to 18.9p.
Net debt amounted to Pounds 5.4m, a reduction of Pounds 22m during the year
with net gearing of 12.7 per cent.
During the year, following a 50 per cent increase in the fixed preferred
dividend with effect from July 1 1992 to 5.9p, fixed preferred dividends of
4.9p were paid to preference shareholders.
The company said that it intended to move to a progressive dividend policy
'reflecting a level of payment and cover appropriate to LWT's performance
and cash position.'
LWT paid a relatively modest Pounds 7.58m bid to retain its London weekend
franchise.
The shares rose 23p to 378p.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National establishes mortgage
insurance offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender, yesterday disclosed that it had
established a captive insurer to provide its mortgage indemnity insurance.
Abbey last month announced its intention to write its own mortgage indemnity
insurance.
It has established a subsidiary, Carfax Insurance, in Guernsey with working
capital of Pounds 10m. It will be managed by Willis Corroon Management.
Abbey was now starting talks with re-insurers. It was confident about the
outcome, and there was no question of returning to previous arrangements for
mortgage cover, held with a panel of insurers.
The move marks the first break with traditional insurers by a large mortgage
lender as a result of the re-negotiation of mortgage indemnity terms over
the past year. Insurers have both raised rates and made terms more
restrictive.
Mr John Bayliss, deputy chairman, said the company had been offered terms
which were 1.5 times as expensive by its panel of insurers and which
provided only 65 per cent of the cover under traditional mortgage indemnity
terms.
He said Abbey would not charge its traditional commission on mortgage
indemnity cover payments made by borrowers, and therefore the amount
available to provide cover on its properties would rise by 30 per cent.
'This will give us a competitive edge because we will be able to look at our
own book and possessions and balance our cover. It will be cheaper in the
long term,' he said.
Mr Bayliss said that Carfax could be made into a close company in two or
three years time if a foreign insurance company entered the British scene
offering better terms than the traditional mortgage insurers.
A number of building societies have also made inquiries about establishing
captive insurers to replace traditional contracts. But they are limited
because they are barred from owning more than 15 per cent of a non-life
insurer.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Difficulty of reading between the lines -
Accounts reveal dependence on short-term borrowings at Queens Moat Houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE MOST recent accounts of Queens Moat Houses
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for the year to December 31 1991 - give some indication of the financial
difficulties facing the company.
The document, however, is far from generous in the amount of information it
provides for readers of the financial statements.
What the accounts do reveal is a dependence on short-term borrowings,
profits bolstered by property sales and enhanced by taking costs through the
balance sheet.
The balance sheet excludes significant liabilities from off-balance sheet
financing. It is is now threatened by a downwards revaluations of
substantial property assets.
The short-term nature of the company's borrowings is shown from the note on
bank loans, with Pounds 658m repayable other than by instalments between one
and two years and a further Pounds 6m by instalments over the same period.
The value of assets on the balance sheet may well have been substantially
reduced during the current year.
This is because the accounting policy notes shows that the company revalues
its hotel and catering properties every year on December 31 by independent
valuers.
The tangible assets note shows that Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the surveyors,
conducted the valuation at the end of 1991, which reduced group assets of
Pounds 2.04bn by Pounds 83m.
Given the softness of hotel values, a much sharper downward valuation is
likely for the 1992 accounts which were due to be reported next week.
The accounting note shows that the company - in common with a number of
others in the hotel and leisure industries - chooses to revalue its freehold
properties rather than depreciating them, which would add costs to the
profit and loss account.
Less commonly, Queens Moat also does not depreciate furniture and equipment.
While replacement furniture and equipment is charged against revenue, these
items are capitalised whenever they are up-graded.
The tangible assets note shows that there was no depreciation of furniture
and equipment, which was recorded at Pounds 153m.
If that sum had been depreciated over seven years - the rate it uses for
these items on short leasehold properties - that would have added Pounds 21m
to costs on the profit and loss account.
The leasing commitments note shows that the company entered into a series of
sale and leaseback transactions during the year which run for five years.
There is no indication of the value of these leases, which are 'off balance
sheet'. Their inclusion would add to the group's liabilities.
The chairman's statement reveals, however, that the company sold and leased
back eight newly-acquired or newly-built hotels and two small office blocks
for Pounds 104m.
The source of funds statement - which is unusually placed after all the
notes at the rear of the accounts - shows sales of fixed assets of Pounds
150m during the year. But the tangible asset note shows disposals of Pounds
124m.
This means that the difference - Pounds 26m - probably represents profits on
the sale of disposals, which constitute a highly material 29 per cent of the
operating profits of Pounds 90m. But this sum is not separately disclosed in
the accounts.
The balance sheet shows Pounds 207m in convertible cumulative redeemable
preference shares.
Under the Accounting Standard Board's new proposals on capital instruments,
these would be classified as debt, and would significantly increase gearing.
The company capitalised interest payments of Pounds 14m in 1991, which added
a net Pounds 4m to the balance sheet total of capitalised interest of Pounds
21m.
This policy is not unusual, but substantially reduces the costs charged
against the profit and loss account.
There is no disclosure of the extent of exposure to foreign currencies,
although the accounting policy says that any differences in foreign
borrowings are taken directly to reserves.
Taxation of Pounds 12m is an unusually low proportion of the Pounds 90m
profit on ordinary activities at just 14 per cent, compared with the normal
UK corporate tax rate of 33 per cent.
The group auditor is Bird Luckin, an accountancy firm with 15 chartered
accountants and offices in London, Dunmow, Witham, Braintree, Brentford and
Chelmsford.
The firm does not feature in any league table of the largest 50 accountants,
and has no other quoted company clients.
Total audit fees paid by Queens Moat - which includes the fees of other
auditors to subsidiaries, such as Arthur Andersen for the German businesses
 -were Pounds 400,000 in 1991.
Mr Maurice Hart, who joined Queens Moat in September 1991 as a non-executive
director and is chairman of its audit and remuneration committee, was
formerly senior partner of Bird Luckin.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Intrigue and drama behind the cameras - The
legal wranglings going on in the SelecTV boardroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Buckley, the ousted chairman of SelecTV, the independent
production company, is pushing for an independent legal investigation of
affairs at the company, famous for hits such as Birds of a Feather and
Lovejoy.
The former chairman is also trying to win support from institutional
investors such as JCFM, the fund management company of stockbrokers James
Capel, for an extraordinary meeting of the television company to look at
what he believes are irregularities in the way SelecTV has been run.
The drama happening behind the cameras is every bit as intense as anything
SelecTV has produced on screen.
It involves intrigue, enormous egos and a plot to overthrow the managing
director - a plan which backfired when one of those involved changed his
mind and it was the chairman who was ousted.
The small cast of characters includes Mr Buckley, chairman until he was
ousted. He was a co-founder, with Mr Allan McKeown, of the modern Select,
formed in 1988 through the acquisition of Witzend Productions, Mr McKeown's
television production company. Before then SelecTV had mainly been involved
in cable television.
Then there is Mr Peter Laister, a former chairman of Thorn EMI who is a
Select non-executive director because he once represented Mr Robert
Maxwell's stake in the company. It was sold just before his death. Mr
Laister has now assumed the chairman's role.
The other two characters are Mr Michael Pilsworth, who is in charge of
day-to-day management, and Mr Tony Charles, who is in charge of production.
Mr Buckley was involved last week in the issuing of a writ against Mr
McKeown, the SelecTV managing director, who is married to actress Tracy
Ullman. The writ became public, with details published in the Sunday Times.
The statement of claim alleges that Mr McKeown received Pounds 140,000 more
than he was entitled to for renting a central London house he owned as
offices for Witzend. An agreement drawn up in October 1988 set an annual fee
for the use of the premises at Pounds 40,000.
Solicitors Memery Crystal, who were asked to review SelecTV board minutes
and documents by Mr Buckley with the knowledge of Mr Laister, found that the
amount paid to Mr McKeown had increased first to Pounds 60,000 and then to
Pounds 80,000 a year.
Memery Crystal found that on the basis of the information and documents
available to them this was done without notice or explanation.
SelecTV raised Pounds 4.25m last month mainly to fund its share of
development at Meridian Broadcasting, the new southern England ITV
franchise, where it is a 15 per cent stakeholder.
The rights issue document states in a note that Mr McKeown receives Pounds
80,000 a year for the house, 'a rate negotiated on an arm's length basis in
April 1990.'
Estate agents Hartnell Taylor Cook advised on the current rental value of
the property in Derby Street last month and said that a rent of Pounds
27,250 a year was appropriate.
The statement of claim also alleges that Mr McKeown did not make formal
disclosure to the full board about Dollars 135,000 advanced to Witzend to
enter a partnership to produce a play, The Big Love, in which Ms Ullman
would star.
According to the statement of claim the production of the play was not
successful and no part of the sum of Dollars 135,000 was recovered. It is,
however, believed the issue of the investment was raised with individual
board members.
The matters alleged came to light after Mr Buckley, who owns 4 per cent of
the company, became concerned about the scale and cost of SelecTV's US
operation, run by Mr McKeown. Memery Crystal were asked to review company
minutes and documents relating to four transactions.
Apart from the licence on the Derby Street house and the contribution to the
play, they involved an alleged payment by the company of Pounds 17,000 for
an option on a film; and an alleged payment to Mr McKeown of Dollars 33,000
salary in October and November last year, when the monthly salary authorised
by the company for those months was Dollars 16,666 a month.
In an assessment delivered to the board last Friday, Memery Crystal, after
taking counsel's advice, said the matters appeared very serious and that the
board should take immediate steps to recover 'all sums misappropriated.' If
the board did not do so then each director would be personally liable.
Memery Crystal advocated the dismissal of Mr McKeown because of his alleged
'gross misconduct.' The board decided that the best action was to to have
the allegations fully investigated by the company's solicitors Richards
Butler.
On the same day (March 26) a draft circular to shareholders was drawn up by
Memery Crystal on the instructions of Mr Buckley and with Mr Laister's
knowledge giving notice of an extraordinary meeting of the company to be
held on April 20.
The proposed resolution was that Mr McKeown be removed from office as a
director of the company.
The termination of Mr McKeown's contract and the licence fee on the London
house would save SelecTV Pounds 475,000 in the current financial year apart
from travel and related expenses, the document said.
The circular which was never sent also said the company would cease US
operations in their present form.
Later on Friday Mr Laister called the offices of Memery Crystal and agreed
that the writ against Mr McKeown should be issued.
'I did not object to it being issued but I made it clear I did not want it
to be served,' Mr Laister said.
Yesterday, Mr Laister said he regretted his decision to go ahead with the
writ which has not been served and which the board now wants to withdraw.
Mr Laister appeared to change his mind over the weekend on how SelecTV's
difficulties should be resolved but he said he saw his role as the company's
only non-executive director as listening to everyone.
'I was given a package of papers prepared ahead of time, without my
knowledge, without any input from me and without my agreement,' said Mr
Laister who said his view changed as more facts became available to him.
At a board meeting on Monday Mr Buckley was dismissed as chairman of the
company, although he still is a director and replace by Mr Laister. Only two
people voted. They were Mr Pilsworth and Mr Charles who both voted for the
removal of Mr Buckley.
At the board meeting it was also decided to ask Richards Butler to conduct a
thorough investigation into all the issues raised. A report is expected
early next week.
Mr Laister said the review would be thorough and that he would make 'a very
full statement' on all the matters involved.
Earlier this week he suggested that the issues could be technical and
administrative. He said that neither he nor Mr McKeown could talk about the
issues until the review was completed.
Issues have got to be sorted out as a matter of fact but I am not going to
do so in the columns of the press,' said Mr Laister.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Boustead incurs Pounds 49,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOUSTEAD, the industrial products and technical services group acquired last
year by Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, yesterday
reported full year results which reflected tough trading conditions and the
impact of a wide-ranging restructuring.
After Jack Chia-MPH acquired its controling 74.77 per cent interest a new
management team undertook restructuring aimed at streamlining the group's
structure, improving its business focus, reducing gearing and lowering the
cost base.
Costs associated with the restructuring led to a Pounds 49,000 pre-tax loss
in 1992 compared with a Pounds 886,000 profit.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 78.1m (Pounds 76.5m).
After a Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 1.64m) extraordinary charge to cover the
closure of two Singapore businesses and costs of the change in control, and
'exceptionally high' tax charges of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 480,000), losses
per share were 1.6p, compared to earnings of 0.6p.
However, the final dividend is held at a recommended 0.35p, maintaining the
total for the year at 0.7p.
In Singapore a number of businesses which did not fit the new strategy were
sold or closed last year, reducing the number of businesses there from 31 to
11.
In the UK, following business sales and mergers, the group is now focused on
the manufacture of industrial products for European markets in two main
business areas, automotive components and cleaning equipment.
Since the year-end the group has sold another two businesses in Singapore
and one in the UK for a total of Pounds 8.9m, bringing overall proceeds from
disposals to Pounds 12.9m.
These funds have mainly been used to strengthen the balance sheet.
If all the disposals had been completed by the year-end the group would have
had net cash of Pounds 2.9m and shareholders funds of Pounds 20.5m.
The group is changing its financial year-end to March 31 to conform with
Jack Chia-MPH's accounting year.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lifeline from Platt Saco creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Platt Saco Lowell, the UK's biggest remaining textile machinery
manufacturer, yesterday agreed to keep the business going for four weeks
while the administrators try to sell it.
Some 120 people have been sacked this week as part of a survival plan drawn
up by Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry of KPMG Peat Marwick, the
administrators, reducing the business to a core of about 70 people.
The Lancashire - based company went into administration in February to
protect it against creditors. Its financial difficulties followed a slump in
sales because of recession. Creditors were told total debts were Pounds
3.6m, mainly to suppliers.
However, there is no secured debt and the company's US owner capitalised
Pounds 2.8m of inter-company debt last October to stave off possible
closure. Assets have a book value of Pounds 3.4m but are unlikely to make
half that figure on sale.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Costain hit by heavy contract provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN Group's fall in operating profits from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 2.9m
followed losses in engineering and construction and in residential and
commercial property, offset by mining profits.
Provisions of Pounds 8m for the Channel tunnel contract and of Pounds 10m
for six other problem contracts pushed the engineering and construction
division into a Pounds 5.3m loss, compared with a Pounds 24.6m profit. Sales
slipped to Pounds 933m (Pounds 979.1m).
In residential and commercial property losses were reduced from Pounds 14.6m
to Pounds 7.1m. A further write-down of Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 32.5m) in land
values - part of the exceptional items - reduced the average price per plot
to Pounds 11,000, 18 per cent of the selling price.
The exceptional write-down on commercial property amounted to Pounds 30.5m,
mostly related to Spitalfields.
Mining made a reduced contribution of Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 33.6m) after a
slip in Australia from 1991's record levels. Mr Peter Costain, chief
executive, said the Australian coal mining business, which has been sold to
Hanson, contributed Pounds 19m.
US mining was again disappointing. Management changes had been made and
modernisation embarked on in Kentucky. Assets were written down by Pounds
33.9m.
Discontinued housing and mineral businesses in the US accounted for most of
the Pounds 56m extraordinary charge.
Losses per share were 68.2p (37.5p). The shares fell from 35p to 29p.
COMMENT
With debt so high and questions still remaining over the values attached to
Spitalfields and US mining, Costain's preoccupation must be with its balance
sheet rather than its earnings for shareholders. Sadly it still has to run
to keep still on its debt level. In April 1991 a Pounds 77m rights issue
relieved peak debt of about Pounds 370m, then Pounds 101m was raked in for
the investment property portfolio and now the crown jewels in Australia have
been sold. It desperately needs to rebuild profitability in US mining for
which so much was paid in the late 1980s. UK housing has also proved an
expensive trip, but at least the write-downs should enable profitable sales.
The heart of the business remains engineering and construction. The company
swears it is not taking on unprofitable work, but the outlook for margins
remains weak. This year it might break even before any further provisions.
Debt and annual interest payments of well over Pounds 20m remain an
albatross and it is difficult to see when a dividend might be resumed. It is
hard to make a case for holding the shares.

FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Burmah ahead but warns on German side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubri-cants, chemicals and fuels group, increased
pre-tax profits by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 179.6m last year in spite of
trading it described as 'no better than in 1991.'
Burmah's shares rose 18p to 750p.
Sales rose from Pounds 2.22bn to Pounds 2.36bn, and the results benefited
from a lower tax charge and a Pounds 3m gain on currency translation.
However, the group warned that the trading outlook was tough in Germany,
which accounted for about 20 per cent of group business - particularly for
chemicals used in the foundry and steel businesses.
Burmah said it was about half way through its restructuring of the
metallurgical functions of Foseco, the company it bought for Pounds 260m at
the end of 1990. Foseco's total manufacturing capacity will ultimately be
reduced by up to 20 per cent. To date, six plants have been closed or
decreased in scope, and the group will now concentrate on shrinking the
European operation.
Group trading profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 203.9m to
Pounds 216.9m. Lubricants profits increased from Pounds 130.1m to Pounds
136.5m, with total volumes up 10 per cent and margins well maintained.
The group said a particularly good performance was recorded in the US, in
spite of the Pounds 6m cost of launching Castrol Syntec, the synthetic
lubricant. Asia showed gains in a number of territories. In Europe, good
results came from Turkey, Italy and export agencies, but Germany slipped.
Trading profit from chemicals was slightly lower at Pounds 36.4m. The
metallurgical market declined by 20 per cent, as recessionary pressures
increased in both the foundry and steel markets worldwide.
Fuels trading profit rose by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 29.2m. Strong results in
Turkey, Sweden and Chile were supplemented by a Pounds 1.9m gain on a public
flotation in Turkey of a minority stake in a joint venture there.
The net interest charge fell 14 per cent to Pounds 40.7m, and reflected the
receipt of business disposal proceeds, tighter control of working capital
and lower interest rates.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said: 'A clear trend in trading is not yet
discernible from the early months of 1993. Consumer markets are in general
proving better than industrial and this will underpin Castrol's continued
growth. Chemicals will benefit from its reduced cost base. Prospects for the
smaller business groups are mixed.'
Burmah's tax charge fell slightly to Pounds 79.6m, but the effective tax
rate fell from 47 to 43 per cent. By moving Foseco acquisition borrowings
overseas to where the principal businesses were located, the group's
write-off of advance corporation tax was reduced by Pounds 8m, to Pounds
3.1m.
Net borrowings increased by Pounds 15m to Pounds 370m as foreign currency
borrowings translated into higher sterling amounts. However, shareholders'
funds rose by Pounds 52m to Pounds 548m. Gearing fell from 72 to 68 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose from 42.6p to 48.7p. A final dividend of 16.5p gives
a total for the year of 25.25p (24p).

FT  02 APR 93 / All change in foreign exchanges: The nature of international
currency dealing has altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who pushed sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism last year
and brought chaos to the currency markets?
Most people point the finger at young dealers in commercial banks - the boys
in red braces - trading millions of pounds per second. But the world's
central banks are coming up with a different answer.
Their evidence suggests the men in grey suits - investment fund and pension
fund managers - make the really big decisions in currency markets. And there
are signs that these investors - backed by massive funds and portfolios -
are changing the nature of currency dealing in a way that may pose problems
for governments and banks.
Until 10 years ago, foreign exchange dealing was dominated by large numbers
of commercial banks and big corporations, trading currencies mainly for
their own books. But in the late 1980s, the foreign exchange business
attracted investment institutions with huge portfolios.
The deregulation of the world's financial markets encouraged these funds to
broaden their activities across the globe. Some invested directly in the
currency market, believing that exchange rate movements made currencies as
profitable as other financial instruments. Others bought currencies to hedge
the exposure of their underlying foreign assets.
Overall, the flows generated by investment institutions are far greater than
those that the banks are prepared to risk. A currency dealing room in a big
London bank will have tens of million of pounds with which to operate on any
one day. But a big investment fund could push a billion dollars through the
market.
The impact of larger flows on the currency market was highlighted by a
report by the Bank for International Settlements - the central bankers' bank
 -this week. It said turnover in foreign exchange increased 42 per cent
between 1989 and 1992 to an estimated Dollars 880bn (Pounds 620bn) per
business day in April of last year.
Much of that increase is not matched by a similar expansion of world trade.
More specifically, the BIS says that non-bank trade in the currency market
has grown. 'Transactions with other market participants have expanded more
rapidly than those between dealers,' the report says.
There are signs that these huge flows are changing the nature of foreign
exchange dealing.
There has been a greater concentration of business in London, the main
currency trading centre, because it can provide the huge pools of liquidity
that investors seek. London increased its share of the world's FX turnover
from 25 per cent in 1989 to nearly 30 per cent in 1992. According to the
BIS, there are now more dollars and D-Marks traded in London than in the US
or Germany.
There is a growing concentration of business among a decreasing number of
banks. Only the biggest banks can convince customers they have the financial
muscle to carry the liquidity and credit risk involved in large-scale
trading. The Bank of England reported last year that the 10 most active
banks in the City of London had 43 per cent of turnover, up from 36 per cent
in 1986.
The US dollar is losing some of its dominance as a reserve currency to the
D-Mark. The D-Mark has overtaken the yen as the second most widely traded
currency, being involved in 38 per cent of all currency deals. Mr Neil
MacKinnon of Citibank in London says: 'The growing use of the D-Mark
reflects the internationalisation of investment opportunities and the
greater importance of European bond markets.'
Do these developments matter? There are grounds for thinking they will
present new challenges to businessmen, politicians and central bankers.
Mr David Clark, European Treasurer at HSBC Holdings in London, believes new
participants will find it increasingly difficult to get into the market. 'I
expect to see smaller market participants trying to deal in newly
convertible currencies like the Hungarian forint,' he says.
London's growing dominance may also make it difficult for banks to develop
foreign exchange operations in any other European centre.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says
this should concern politicians thinking of putting a European central bank
outside London.
'The BIS report shows that London did extraordinarily well even though it
was outside the ERM for part of the three-year period,' he says. 'The
decision to put the European central bank somewhere other than London would
be a nonsense given the primacy of the UK capital in foreign exchange.'
But for central bankers wishing to control exchange rates through
intervention, the sheer size of the market must be the biggest concern.
Mr MacKinnon says: 'If domestic economic policies are wrong - as they have
been in Europe recently - the currency markets play a useful role in forcing
central banks to adapt their policies.'

FT  02 APR 93 / Queens Moat move surprised banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS Moat Houses, which on Wednesday suspended its shares because of its
concerns that it had run into financial difficulties, had given no inkling
to its bankers of problems only a week ago, when it was negotiating a new
DM750m (Pounds 320m) borrowing facility.
The astonishingly rapid reversal in Queens Moat's view of its financial
prospects emerged yesterday, as the group's banks appointed Grant Thornton,
the accountants, to investigate why the hotel group has run into financial
difficulties.
The banks have asked for a report in seven days from Grant Thornton's
investigators, who went into Queens Moat's offices at 8.30am yesterday.
A full meeting of the hotel group's 45 banks, led by National Westminster
and Barclays, will be held as soon as the initial report is completed,
probably at the end of next week.
'I have never known a corporate crisis erupt so quickly,' a banker said.
Another banker said he was still waiting for a 'cogent explanation' from the
company.
Bankers said yesterday that they would insist on management changes at the
company. They were negotiating with Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, and
Mr David Hersey, finance director, on the terms of a new DM750m borrowing
facility, called a multi-option facility.
A banker said that there had been no indication during these talks that the
group's 1992 profits might be different from analysts' forecast of around
Pounds 80m before tax. However bankers now fear that the group may have made
no profit at all last year.
One banker said that the change in the group's view of its prospects was the
result of work by its founder and chairman, Mr John Bairstow.
He had started to become more actively involved in the group last summer,
having had a less direct involvement for a period. Mr Bairstow is understood
to have reviewed the group's accounting policies and the valuation of its
assets.
Queens Moat did not tell its merchant bank adviser, Charterhouse, that it
was in financial difficulties until Tuesday afternoon. The following day,
its shares were suspended on the stock exchange and the group cancelled the
payment of a dividend on preference shares. Queens Moat has debt of more
than Pounds 1bn, including an off-balance sheet exposure which at the end of
1991 was Pounds 133m. The group has to repay Pounds 658m of its debt within
the next year. Bankers said they would probably insist that Queens Moat
comes up with a plan to reduce debt by selling assets.

FT  02 APR 93 / VW accused of luring away Opel senior staff

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's struggling car giant, was yesterday accused of
undermining Opel, its main domestic rival, by luring away senior executives
with offers of doubled salaries.
In the past two weeks more than 40 top purchasing, logistics and production
managers had been offered up to DM400,000 (Pounds 164,000) a year to leave
General Motors' German subsidiary for VW, Mr Horst Borghs, an Opel director
alleged yesterday. Attempts to attract others, including main board
directors, could not be excluded, Mr Borghs added.
A VW spokesman said he could not explain the 'massive attack'. A full
statement would not be issued until the accusations had been legally
assessed.
Mr Borghs said that some of VW's targets, after rebuffing initial courtship,
had been telephoned by their former boss, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, until recently head of worldwide purchasing at GM in Detroit.
He joined VW after a tussle in mid-March. He quit GM one day after saying in
a statement he intended to continue working for GM - 'for the company I love
and for the people I love'. He is reputed to have been tempted away with a
five-year contract worth Dollars 20m.
Mr Lopez was followed almost immediately to VW in Wolfsburg by six top
members of his Detroit buying team.
In a bitter letter sent yesterday to Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new chairman,
Mr David Herman, Opel's chairman, warned that the conflict would ultimately
lead to 'counter-measures'.
These could include possible legal action if Mr Lopez failed to confirm in
writing that he had respected secrecy obligations in his GM contract and
that he had not taken any documents to VW relating to the US group's
corporate plans. Mr Lopez, by virtue of his key role at GM, would have had
access to highly sensitive, top-secret information.
According to the letter, employees had the right to take advantage of career
opportunities. However, Mr Herman added, it set a new style in German
industry when a competitor systematically undermined another company, and to
attain that goal made excessive financial offers.
VW, which earlier this week reported a crash into an unprecedented DM1.25bn
loss in the first three months of this year, was 'creating the impression of
wanting to solve its problems through a massive head-hunting campaign at
Opel', said Opel.

FT  02 APR 93 / Queens Moat banks launch inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANT Thornton, the accountants, were appointed yesterday by Queens Moat
Houses' banks to investigate why the hotel group has run into financial
difficulties.
The banks have asked for a report in seven days from Grant Thornton's
investigators, who went into Queens Moat's offices at 8.30am yesterday.
A full meeting of the hotel group's 45 banks, led by National Westminster
and Barclays, will be held as soon as the initial report is completed,
probably at the end of next week.
A banker said one of the main issues for the banks was whether Queens Moat's
senior management should be changed. 'I have never known a corporate crisis
erupt so quickly,' he said. Another banker said he had no inkling that the
group was in difficulties until Queens Moat suspended its shares on
Wednesday. 'The group has given no cogent explanation for why its finances
have deteriorated so rapidly,' the banker said.
Queens Moat has debt of more than Pounds 1bn, including an off-balance sheet
exposure which at the end of 1991 was Pounds 133m.
Banks are uncertain whether Queens Moat's financial difficulties are purely
the result of a change in its accounting policies or whether there has also
been a sharp deterioration in trading. 'We are not even certain whether the
group made a profit or loss last year,' one banker said. 'We will have to
wait to see what Grant Thornton says.'
The group's competitors believed that Queens Moat had been trading well in
the UK and that its market share had been holding up. At the end of 1991,
Queens Moat had 103 hotels in the UK and 86 hotels in Germany, the
Netherlands and other parts of continental Europe.
The group has to repay Pounds 658m of its debt within the next year. Until
the shares were suspended, the banks had been working with the group on a
plan to roll-over the debt. That plan will now be reviewed.
Bankers said they would probably insist that Queens Moat comes up with a
plan to reduce debt by selling assets.
Barclays and National Westminster have the biggest loans to Queens Moat, of
more than Pounds 80m each.
Holders of the company's Pounds 215m 10 1/4 per cent debenture stock, due an
interest payment totalling Pounds 11m yesterday, were relieved to receive
their cheques.
Bass, the UK brewing group which owns the Holiday Inn chain, yesterday
dismissed the possibility that it could emerge as a buyer of a large number
of Queens Moat hotels, but said it might be interested in buying selected
hotels to aid growth in specific markets.

FT  02 APR 93 / Costain doubles pre-tax loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN Group, the heavily indebted UK construction and mining concern,
doubled its pre-tax losses to Pounds 148.6m last year and again passed its
final dividend.
Had it reported under the FRS 3 accounting standard, which forces
extraordinary losses above the line, the pre-tax deficit would have exceeded
Pounds 200m.
Net assets at the end of December were cut to Pounds 75m, breaching banking
covenants. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said this would be rectified
by the sale of its Australian coal mining business to Hanson, pushing pro
forma net assets up to about Pounds 160m. The sale was worth Pounds 198m to
Costain - Pounds 157m in payment for the business and Pounds 41m in debt
relief. The way was cleared for the disposal less than two weeks ago when an
out-of-court settlement was reached with Hanson's Peabody subsidiary.
Wrangles broke out last autumn when Costain entertained a rival bid from
Altus Finance, part of the French bank Credit Lyonnais.
Mr Costain said a consortium of banks, led by NatWest, were being supportive
and the group had adequate working capital until March 1995. Net debt rose
from Pounds 125m to Pounds 331m last year. The main factors were Pounds 56m
of borrowings brought on to the balance sheet for the Spitalfields site in
the City of London, and the Pounds 58m impact of adverse currency movements.
Debt had increased by Pounds 67.1m since the end of the year. This followed
seasonal outflows of cash in the engineering and construction division, more
cash absorbed by the Channel tunnel contract and a further negative currency
effect of Pounds 21.6m.
Mr Costain said the up-to-date net-debt figure, taking account of the sale
to Hanson, was about Pounds 210m. 'We are seeking to reduce that by
disposals.' These might bring in Pounds 50m this year.
Operating profit fell from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 2.9m on reduced turnover
of Pounds 1.24bn. Interest costs were Pounds 18.2m, compared with Pounds
23m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 133.3m, mainly for write-downs in
the value of housing land, commercial property and mining assets.
Mr Costain said Pounds 19m of annual costs had been taken out of the
businesses. The workforce had been cut by 1,100 to 4,300.
One bright spot was the international order book which had grown to Pounds
177m by February compared with Pounds 49m a year earlier.

FT  02 APR 93 / Allies ready to enforce Bosnian no-fly zone: Major says
Serbian sanctions may be extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 100 western aircraft are expected to be deployed this month to enforce
the no-fly zone over Bosnia after the United Nations Security Council
resolution on Wednesday night approved the operation.
US, British, French and possibly Dutch aircraft would be involved in any
action aimed at curbing Serb aggression. Nato officials said ambassadors of
the 16 allies would meet, perhaps today, to discuss details. The UN
resolution takes effect after seven days, and the aircraft could be in place
soon after that.
Mr John Major, prime minister, told parliament that the government was also
discussing with its allies extending sanctions against the Serbs. 'We would
be perfectly prepared to contemplate the widening of sanctions as well as
stricter enforcement of existing sanctions.'
Although his words were welcomed, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, led MPs from
all parts of the Commons in expressing concern that sanctions had not, so
far, been enforced effectively enough.
'If there is to be a lessening of the sickening events involving innocent
women and children, sanctions must be applied much more effectively against
Serbia, and the international community must insist that humanitarian
convoys are accompanied by military escorts,' Mr Smith said.
Some opposition MPs also criticised western governments for failing to
enforce the no-fly zone when it was announced last year. Mr Paddy Ashdown,
Liberal Democrat leader, called on the government to recommend to other
western powers that Srebrenica be protected from the Serbs. Other MPs
expressed concern about the safety of British troops involved in the
enforcement operation.
The German government, meanwhile, will hold an emergency cabinet session
today to vote on whether German crews can participate in imposing the no-fly
zone. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has interrupted his holiday to chair the
session, will insist that German personnel should remain on board Nato
surveillance aircraft implementing the UN decision. He has the backing of
the Christian Democratic Union, and its sister party, the Christian Social
Union.
However, the liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition,
said they would vote against any German crews involved in missions enforcing
the UN resolution. They would immediately appeal to the constitutional
court.
'As long as the constitutional court has not decided, German troops should
not be allowed to remain on board (the Awacs),' Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader
of the Free Democrats, said yesterday. A third of Awacs crews are German.
Article 24 of the constitution allows German troops to fight alongside Nato.
Since 1949, the federal government has held that the constitution does not
allow the deployment of German forces outside the Nato area.
But the CDU/CSU has dropped this position as a result of German unification,
the break-up of the Warsaw Pact, and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.

FT  02 APR 93 / US group to spend Dollars 6bn on three gas plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENRON, one of the largest gas companies in the US, expects to announce plans
to build at least three gas-fired power stations worldwide by the end of the
year - one in the UK - at a total cost of close to Dollars 6bn (Pounds
4.2bn).
The company yesterday inaugurated its 1,875MW power plant at Teesside which
is the largest combined heat and power station in the world.
Mr Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron, said the Teesside plant
in which the company owns a 50 per cent stake will be a showpiece for its
worldwide power operations. The Teesside station cost Pounds 850m and took
just over two years to build, which the company believes is the shortest
construction time ever for a plant of this size.
Mr Lay said the company was in discussions about a Dollars 600m gas-fired
power plant in Kuwait and a Dollars 2bn power project in Turkey, where it is
working with Midlands Electricity which also has a stake in Teesside. Enron
is also negotiating with India about a Dollars 3bn complex south of Bombay.
Mr Lay stressed that Enron would not be investing the full cost of these
plants because the company did not plan to take more than a half share in
each venture and all would be funded by project finance.
'Our vision is to become the world's first global gas integrated company
capable of developing projects in any segment of the gas business like the
oil majors 50 years ago,' he said. Mr Lay believes that gas will become a
more important fuel than oil early next century.
In the UK, he said the company was involved in detailed discussions about
three or four new gas-fired stations, one of which he expected to go ahead
with by the end of the year at a probable cost of about Dollars 400m.
Enron is finalising a Dollars 200m project for Russia's Gazprom to update
part of its pipeline system and compressor stations. The company is also
talking to China about setting up a joint venture to construct a 2,000MW to
4,000MW power station at a cost of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn.
Enron transports about 18 per cent of US gas usage through its pipelines and
had a turnover of Dollars 6.33bn last year. It operates four gas-fired power
stations in the US with another under construction.

FT  02 APR 93 / Rail strike forecast to cause 'bedlam'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL WORKERS, miners and some London bus crews strike today in the biggest
burst of co-ordinated public sector industrial action in recent years.
The 24-hour rail strike will cause the greatest disruption, with the
Automobile Association predicting 'traffic bedlam', particularly in the
capital.
London Underground workers are not expected to join in the action, although
about 20 Tube stations, where tracks are shared with British Rail, could be
closed.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, warned drivers not to bring
their cars into the capital unless they were sure of a parking space.
The Confederation of British Industry said employers expected staff to 'make
every effort to get into work if they can', using alternative means of
transport - including car-sharing, cycling and walking.
Many companies would be arranging coaches and allowing flexible starting and
finishing times, said the CBI. The Institute of Management has suggested
working from home.
The strikes have been timed to coincide with a day of action by the European
Trade Union Confederation. British union representatives will join EC unions
in a march through Brussels.
Mr Norman Willis, who is president of the ETUC as well as general secretary
of the Trades Union Congress, said the protest was 'aimed at focusing public
attention across Europe on the evils of mass unemployment, unacceptable
working conditions and the growing threats from racism and xenophobia'.
To comply with the law against secondary strike action, all the participants
in today's stoppages are emphasising their individual grievances with their
employers. The National Union of Mineworkers was the first group to go for a
strike today and production at many pits ceased last night as about 30,000
walked out.
The NUM believes that it can still stop privatisations and closures by
mobilising public support.
About 68,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union are striking
because BR is refusing to guarantee that there will be no compulsory
redundancies. It is understood that BR management could take a much harder
line over any future industrial action.
About two thirds of red London buses are expected to be off the roads in a
dispute about longer working hours and cuts in pay.

FT  02 APR 93 / Yeltsin accepts referendum planned by Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin has dropped plans to hold his own plebiscite
in order to brave a much tougher referendum set by the Congress of People's
Deputies, one of his closest colleagues said yesterday.
'The president is not going to come out with a separate vote and he will
take part in the referendum whatever its rules are,' said Mr Mikhail
Poltoranin, the head of the government information service.
Such a decision would spare the country the chaos of two rival polls, each
with its own set of questions and rules. But it would also mean Mr Yeltsin
faces a near impossible task, unless he can secure new terms, either through
the constitutional court or in backroom negotiations with the parliamentary
leadership.
Under terms set down by Congress, Mr Yeltsin would have to obtain the
support of more than 50 per cent of all registered voters to declare that he
has the nation's trust to conduct economic and political reforms. Mr Yeltsin
had proposed a majority of those who turned out to vote. The president has
asked the Constitutional Court to examine the legality of the terms.
Meanwhile, the Congress of People's Deputies has virtually guaranteed
protection against the threat of its removal by requiring an equally high
number of Russians to demand early parliamentary elections. Even then, no
date is fixed.
The two other questions posed by parliament are on early presidential
elections and on whether the electorate approves socio-economic policies.
Mr Yeltsin, in going along with parliament's version, would also be deprived
of two questions he wanted to ask: do you want a new constitution and do you
want private land ownership?
Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, who has come under attack
from the parliament which elected him, claimed that the government would
stay out of political battles to focus on the economy.
He also promised further 'corrections' to government economic policy as part
of the government's attempts to drum up popular support before the April 25
vote. He told a meeting of enterprise directors in St Petersburg that this
would include stronger state control over the tax and financial system, and
changes to the enterprise and privatisation laws.
Mr Chernomyrdin also made his first public attack on Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
dynamic young privatisation minister, comparing the rapid pace of the sale
of state-owned enterprises to Stalin's bloody collectivisation policies
which destroyed private agriculture in the 1930s.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next provides a graphic illustration of the rewards that stem from running
an extraordinarily badly-managed business half-way well. Two years ago, Next
recorded a net loss of Pounds 223m. Last year it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 39m. It is easy to see how Next became the City's favourite recovery
stock. But the natural question is: what next?
The company's balance sheet has certainly been transformed. Operationally
too, Next has made giant strides. By rationalising its irrational store
portfolio and cutting its outlets from 450 to 305, Next has boosted
efficiencies. Sales per sq ft have risen 40 per cent over the past two
years.
The company's trading momentum, with sales currently running 12 per cent
ahead, should permit further gains. Sourcing, stock control and service have
all improved significantly but still lag best industry practice. This should
provide further headroom for profits growth without the company having to
resort to anything silly by way of acquisitions.
Next is certainly not going to repeat its spectacular share price
performance of the past year. A sub-market forward rating seems grudging
nonetheless. The same could be said for the whole retail sector which has
been looking forlorn of late.
Results from Kingfisher, Argos and now Next point to consumer spending being
healthier than expected. With costs pared to the bone, operationally-geared
retailers should register strong profits gains on even small sales
increases.

<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates at
yesterday's council meeting is clear confirmation of its gradual approach to
monetary relaxation. That is not only baffling in view of the 1 per cent
fall in German industrial output during February. It also sits uneasily with
the growing realisation on the other side of the Atlantic that the US
recovery slowed during the first quarter. The combination pushed the dollar
back below DM1.60 yesterday - and dollar weakness has a nasty habit of
exacerbating tensions in the ERM.
The obvious implication is that the relative calm which followed the French
elections may not last. While the Bundesbank is being so coy, the new French
government cannot engineer the sharp fall in interest rates needed to reduce
unemployment. Double digit real interest rates are also troubling Danish
voters in the run up to next month's Maastricht referendum.
These factors must be plain for the Bundesbank to see, but they do not loom
large in its thinking. Inflation remains higher than the bank would like but
it is a lagging indicator. The money supply trend has improved, and there is
no longer much sense in using interest rates to apply pressure on the wage
and budget front. With such a weak intellectual case for high interest
rates, it is curious that the Bundesbank should persist.

FT  02 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By today's equity market standards, Burmah Castrol is doing just about
everything right. The strength of its lubricant business has helped lift
profits during recession; rigorous cost-cutting has limited the damage in
chemicals; sterling's devaluation should boost profits in 1993 despite dull
trading conditions. That puts the company in that exclusive group which can
afford to continue increasing its dividends. It is easy in all the
excitement to miss the other message from yesterday's results - that the
Foseco acquisition still has not fulfilled its purpose.
The rationale was always to get away from Burmah's traditional heavy
reliance on lubricants. Instead they still provide just over 60 per cent of
operating profits. Chemicals last year were flat even after the use of
Pounds 10m in acquisition provisions to restructuring costs. The
deteriorating market in Germany, particularly for metallurgical chemicals,
will be a further drag this year.
The Foseco businesses may start to come right in 1994, but by then Burmah
will also have finally unwound its LNG transport risk provision. This has
been providing a Pounds 7m tax-free contribution to earnings. Without it,
the company will have to run hard to stand still.
It is now clear Foseco was bought far too early in the cycle. While it waits
for a return, Burmah will have to rely on its marketing magic in lubricants.
Its record in this area is impressive, but its greatest strength is in the
consumer market rather than the industrial sector where Foseco's strengths
lie. It is no comfort that management went into Foseco precisely because it
was afraid that one day it would slip up in lubricants.

<TEXT>
The pharmaceutical sector is not well used to rights issues, but Medeva is
not made in a conventional mould. Yesterday's Pounds 94m cash call enables
it to buy another handful of ready-made products in a market too small to
interest the industry giants. That is at odds with the tradition of drugs
companies founded squarely on medical research. With regulation and
competition squeezing organic growth across the sector, though, one might
reasonably wonder whether others will be forced to adapt. The thought that
Glaxo might fund a move into over-the-counter medicines with a rights issue
was credible enough to give the market the shakes.
Medeva's unusual approach has not made it immune from the malaise afflicting
the rest of the sector. Since the company is funding its ambitions with
paper, that is more than an inconvenience. On a price/earnings ratio not far
above the market average, it is hardly buying from a position of strength.
The price of the latest buy suggests bargains can still be found among
smaller, privately-owned drugs companies. Whether Medeva can find enough
opportunities to maintain its growth rate - without buying a dud or getting
into unwise areas - remains an open question.
Sensitivity about its rating might explain Medeva's strenuous efforts to
make itself transparent. Its early adoption of FRS3 helps interpret the
previously opaque record of earnings growth. The organic growth evident from
recent full-year figures is encouraging. Others might end up following
Medeva's path, but acquisitions will never be a universal cure.

FT  02 APR 93 / Now comes the hard part: France's new government has little
room for manoeuvre on the economic front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before the election, France's conservatives knew that winning would be
easy, but governing far harder.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, long-time favourite for the job he assumed
this week, had his priorities well-prepared. Within minutes of convening his
new cabinet on Wednesday, he instructed his ministers to cut FFr20bn (Pounds
2.5bn) from the budget to finance tax incentives boosting the construction
industry; to examine new ways of halting the relentless rise in
unemployment; and to salvage the country's pension and unemployment
insurance systems.
But he was equally quick to announce that he would travel to Germany as soon
as Chancellor Helmut Kohl could see him. After months of reflection, Mr
Balladur, and indeed the leadership of his RPR Gaullist party and of its
centre-right UDF partner, can see no way out of France's macro-economic
impasse except to throw their monetary and trade concerns at Mr Kohl's feet,
and seek a more equal relationship with their stronger German partner.
For, the new government badly needs a rapid improvement in the economy. The
rise in industrial output by 0.4 per cent in January, after three months in
which gross domestic product fell by 0.5 per cent, has not shaken the
conviction of most government and bank economists in France that the economy
is totally flat. Without improvement, unemployment will go on rising beyond
its February level of 3,024,000 or 10.6 per cent of the work force. It may
even show a sharp momentary jump in early summer when several hundred
thousand young people finish a temporary work scheme set up by the departed
Socialists.
The audit which the prime minister has commissioned of state finances will
show them in a sorry state after two years of Socialist passivity in the
face of looming recession. The state's central budget deficit was FFr226bn
last year, and it will be nearer FFr300bn this year. The pension and
unemployment insurance schemes, funded by employer/employee contributions,
are also more than FFr65bn in the red, and the state may have to step in
here to bail them out.
But the French economy is not in its 'worst shape since the second world
war', as Mr Balladur said on the campaign trail in a piece of electoral
exaggeration. With low inflation, competitive wages, and a high rate of
personal savings which would flow in massive amounts from money market funds
into the stock market and thence into productive investment - if only
interest rates would come down by several points - France is well-poised to
take advantage of any recovery in its export markets.
The key, of course, to kick-starting this process is a drop in interest
rates, which have been kept at a high level to maintain the franc's parity
with the D-Mark in the European Monetary System. Until the Bundesbank lowers
German interest rates, French hands are tied.
But if and when German rates comes down significantly and if France's budget
deficit and unemployment have stabilised or are heading downwards by the end
of this year, the Balladur government can optimistically expect economic
growth of nearly 2 per cent next year. This would give the centre-right
government a good prospect of staying in power for the next seven years and
of helping a conservative candidate, probably Mr Jacques Chirac, into the
Elysee in 1995.
A President Chirac would probably capitalise on his victory by immediately
calling legislative elections. It is hard to see the French centre-right,
now holding 400 seats more than the combined remnants of the French left,
losing even in two years. The left may well be out of government for the
next seven years. This would give Mr Balladur time for the longer term
aspects of his programme - such as gradually taking the cost of France's
welfare state off the shoulders of companies and putting it on the back of
the state budget - provided he can somehow relaunch growth in the short
term.
In his first move, Mr Balladur has chosen not to reflect fully the
electorate's rightward lurch at the polls in the make-up of his cabinet. He
has put a centrist stamp on it. This is good consensus politics. He is
conscious of the fact that the RPR and UDF won only 40 per cent of the vote
in the first round, though a higher share in the run-off.
But the new cabinet will produce no radical solutions to the country's
economic problems. Free-market Thatcherism has few adherents in France, and
they do not include Mr Balladur, nor Mr Chirac or Mr Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, the leaders of the RPR and UDF, respectively.
These party bosses are not in the government but will cast a long shadow
over it. Mr Chirac has ruled out any lowering of the minimum wage (which
might be one way of preventing the least-qualified workers being priced out
of the job market), while Mr Giscard d'Estaing has ruled out extending
privatisation to a sale of monopoly utilities (despite the money that it
would bring in).
In political and economic terms, Mr Balladur has, in fact, little elbow
room, even on his announced FFr20bn worth of budget savings. He inherits a
1993 budget which his predecessor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, had recently trimmed
by FFr20bn (freezing FFr15bn worth of public spending and cancelling another
FFr5bn).
Most of the impact of these measures was on the army, provoking complaints
from the conservatives who, now in government, will want to let the axe fall
elsewhere, probably on education. But most of the FFr1,367bn budget is
virtually untouchable, with FFr900bn committed on pay or debt service.
Wherever the savings are found, they will be used to finance tax incentives
for the construction and property sectors, which have been hard hit by
recession. The government has come to power with the promise - ambitious in
an economic slowdown - of decreasing the overall burden of direct taxes on
both companies and individuals.
Mr Balladur will not announce his programme until next Thursday. But there
is a plan to reform the system under which all individuals pay the country's
special welfare tax, and another proposal for the state, over 10 years, to
take over the cost of family allowances which at present amount to FFr150bn
and are paid by employers and employees. Employees would, therefore, be
better off, but instead of taking the extra money home, they would have to
put it into savings plans. Indirect taxes, by contrast, may well rise
further on the usual excise targets of alcohol, tobacco and petrol.
But only growth will really swell the state's depleted coffers, and that
depends on interest rates coming down. A Balladur adviser reckons that 'we
have a potential margin of manoeuvre to bring our rates down by more than
six points', because France's short-term rates are a couple of points above
those of Germany, whose inflation rate is a couple of points above that of
France, and because German rates themselves should come down by a couple of
points in the next few months.
In using even a fraction of this 'potential' to cut French rates, while
keeping the franc in lock-step with the D-Mark, the government knows it
cannot move ahead of market sentiment.
But to hurry that sentiment along, it is trying to enlist German support. Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the new finance minister, paid the Bundesbank a visit on
March 24, after his election outright on the first round but before his
ministerial nomination. Mr Alain Juppe, the new foreign minister, is to
visit Bonn in the next few days, followed by Mr Balladur later in the month.
Their collective message is that France will shortly - by July, say some
government advisers - pass a law giving the Banque de France autonomy in
monetary policy. France and Germany will then have two governments with the
same ideological stamp and with central banks of the same independence,
ideally suited to share in monetary policy- setting, or at least to take
more account of each other's monetary concerns.
'From the moment that the Germans accept that they will no longer decide (on
monetary policy) alone, we will have taken a decisive step to European
monetary union,' said Mr Alphandery this week. It is not yet clear that the
German authorities will respond favourably to a rather imprecise French
government request to 'share' monetary policymaking.
But it is clear that France's new government is unhappy about the
constraints on its monetary and trade policies. The conservatives have been
out of power for five years. They feel the Socialists acquiesced in a
Maastricht timetable which is too long to suit France's needs and in a Gatt
negotiation which does not take proper account of French interests.
Determined to be less passive than its predecessor, the new government is
trying, with Germany's help, to redefine the rules of the game.

FT  02 APR 93 / Personal View: Russia's window of opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANATOLI B CHUBAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, the Russian economy is struggling under the combined effects of high
inflation, declining output, demilitarisation, political instability, and a
restructuring of virtually its entire industrial base. The transition to a
consumer-oriented market economy is creating economic and political turmoil.
Never before has so large a country attempted to recreate itself over so
short a time; there is no use understating the scale of the upheaval or the
enormity of the challenge.
Yet with little fanfare from abroad, Russia is now engaged in the most
sweeping effort to change its economy since Peter the Great built St
Petersburg, his 'window on Europe', nearly three centuries ago. Some 5,000
large and medium-sized enterprises are heading for privatisation as Russia
hurries to build a market economy based on private property,
entrepreneurship, and economic opportunity.
Last December, the first auctions for shares in privatised enterprises
began. By the end of this month, more than 700 enterprises will have entered
private hands, creating thousands of shareholders and property owners. The
process began last year with the distribution of a total of 150m
privatisation vouchers to every man, woman and child. Each voucher, with a
face value of Rbs10,000, can be exchanged at privatisation auctions for
shares in large enterprises until the last day of this year, when the
vouchers are set to expire.
At the first auctions, each voucher bought an average of 3.7 shares. Each
share has a face value of Rbs1,000, which corresponds to its historical book
value. The inflation-adjusted book value is probably 20-30 times higher. So,
on average, early-bird investors were able to exchange each Rbs10,000
voucher for shares representing Rbs74,000-Rbs110,000 worth of property.
The enterprises up for auction run the gamut from small, high tech companies
such as the microelectronics concern Eleks, in Vladimir, to Gornozavodsk
Cement in the Urals. All leading industries, from manufacturing to services,
from chemicals and food processing to textiles and jet engines, are
represented.
The early successes of Russian privatisation are a direct result of the
government's commitment to stand clear and let investors operate free from
bureaucratic meddling. To buy shares in privatised enterprises, investors
have only to show up at auction centres with vouchers in hand and place
their bids. There is a large and liquid market for vouchers on exchanges
found in big cities throughout Russia, ensuring that vouchers are easily
purchased in bulk.
Both Russian citizens and foreign investors may buy and sell vouchers and
participate in the auctions at any time and place. Both play by the same
rules. There are no elaborate regulatory barriers, no special fees, permits,
or conditions. With most enterprises offering 30 per cent of their shares
for sale at auction and no limit on the number of shares any single investor
may purchase, investors can acquire large stakes. And soon investors will be
able to bid for shares in enterprises anywhere in Russia from
computer-linked auction centres.
Meanwhile, hundreds of entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity offered by
Russia's privatisation law to launch mutual funds (called 'investment
funds') for purchasing shares in privatised enterprises. The funds offer
voucher holders a way to spread their risk over a portfolio of enterprises.
Foreigners are free to establish new investment funds or to invest in
existing ones.
Eventually, with the shares of thousands of enterprises available for
trading, the embryonic exchanges which have sprouted up from Moscow to
Vladivostok will finance new business formation, investment, and job
creation. With privatisation in effect bringing thousands of initial public
offerings to market this year, the time may not be far off when the Moscow
stock exchange will become a great magnet for international capital.
Russia's experiment with entrepreneurial capitalism faces daunting
obstacles. But few countries can match its combination of a highly-educated
workforce, a first-class science base, a far-flung communications and
transportation infrastructure, and vast reserves of untapped natural
resources. Nowhere is the potential for growth so great and barriers to
foreign investment in privatised enterprises so few.
With privatisation auctions under way almost continuously, a new Russian
economy is rapidly taking shape. When the auction centres close at the end
of this year, an historic window of opportunity for investors will close
with it. Only those who seized the chance to become charter shareholders
will reap the full dividends of Russia's new millennium of freedom.

FT  02 APR 93 / Leading Article: A wasted day of strikes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S one-day strike by some rail, bus and mine workers will be supported
by little more than 100,000 people and will have a minimal impact on the UK
economy. It is not the general strike that miners' leaders had been hoping
for. Nor is it a sign of rising labour militancy throughout the economy: the
number of strikes in January was even lower than last year, a record at the
time, and the government's 1.5 per cent public sector limit is being
accepted with scarcely a murmur of protest.
But it is a powerful reminder of how the strike weapon can still be abused
by public sector workers providing monopoly services, and a depressing
indicator of how little some unions have learned over the past decade. The
mineworkers' present plight is at least in part a result of their industrial
action in the 1970s and 1980s; and the greatest success the miners have
helped to achieve in recent times - temporarily blocking the government's
pit closure programme - happened without losing a single day in strike
action. But the mineworkers at least have the excuse that they have grand
historic traditions to salute as they dwindle into industrial irrelevance,
and in any case are today harming nobody but themselves.
The rail workers have no such excuse. They are causing a great deal of
bother to many hundreds of thousands of commuters. But it is not at all
clear how the anger of those commuters is going to help the cause of job
security on the railways or in the mines. If RMT, the rail union, has real
grievances about job security or privatisation, it should be using its
resources to win over public opinion and to lobby legislators, as it has
done with some success over the issue of the British Rail pension fund.
Strangely, the union seems to have forgotten the lessons of its own
successful strike in 1989 when it put a great deal of effort into winning
over the public rather than ignoring it.
Similarly, action by the London bus workers is not going to win much public
sympathy for the wage cuts that are accompanying privatisation, and which
have been accepted by most bus workers. The strike could also act as a
useful advertisement for the private operators whose routes overlap with
London Buses.
Strikes can have long-lasting and unintended effects, especially where
customers have alternatives. Mr Malcolm Kitchener, managing director of
Parcelforce, said recently that his group has just won back the first
contract from a mail order company, which deserted the Post Office en masse
after the 1971 postal strike. In the case of all three groups taking action
today, the strike weapon is being used in a cavalier fashion which can only
weaken the union case. For the railworkers the strike is essentially an act
of political solidarity with the mineworkers, and British Rail is, rightly,
making it clear to the union that if it takes such action again it will turn
to the law.

True, there could be no fitter quotation to mark the start of the Royal Air

so much owed by so many to so few'. There is, however, another that military
policy-makers in particular would do well to remember.
It was uttered by Field Marshal Sir William Nicholson, chief of the imperial
general staff just seven years before the RAF was formed, and went:
'Aviation is a useless and expensive fad advocated by a few individuals
whose ideas are unworthy of attention.'

Watch out for Alan Sugar, chairman and founder of Amstrad. Having upset his
loyal shareholders and former friends by his attempt to buy back his company
at a knock-down price, he seems intent on refurbishing his public image.
Since the failure to take Amstrad private, the consumer electronics
entrepreneur has been devoting a large chunk of his time and undoubted
marketing skills to a charity fundraising campaign.
In less than six weeks Sugar helped round up another 21 mostly blue-chip
corporate founder members who, together with Amstrad, have contributed more
than Pounds 1m to fund the Excalibur Scholarship Scheme for its first three
years. It will provide private sector scholarships at universities in
Britain for second degree students from central and eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
Perhaps the fates have been watching.
Even though his buy-back bid failed, the value of his 35 per cent stake in
Amstrad has risen by almost Pounds 20m as the company's stock has climbed
back above the 30p a share Sugar was offering.

What would Sir Adrian Cadbury say about Queens Moat, whose shares have been
suspended since Wednesday?
On paper QM would seem to be following best practice on the corporate
governance front. It has an audit and remuneration committee which is
chaired by a non-executive director - Maurice Hart - who is also an
accountant. However, Hart, who has been associated with the group since
1968, was formerly senior partner of Bird Luckin, Queens Moat's relatively
unknown chartered accountants. A review of Bird Luckin's clients shows it
has a single listed company - yup, you guessed it. Queens Moat.

The Overseas Bankers Club, opposite the Bank of England, has always been a
bit of an oddball. Was it set up for British banks which operated mainly
overseas such as the Bank of London and South America, Barclays DCO and
Grindlays? Or was it a dining room for foreign banks in London which
couldn't afford their own facilities?
Whatever the origins, the decision to change its name to The Bankers Club
should help clear up the confusion. Although the number of foreign banks in
London is much the same as ever, the number of foreign bankers with big
expense accounts has been falling and the club badly needs more members.
Interesting to see whether the change of name will also lead to a change in
the tradition of the club president being a Brit, and preferably titled.

No one could accuse Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the redoubtable Zulu leader
in South Africa, of dereliction of duty. He has just finished delivering his
longest ever policy speech - so long it deserves a mention in the Guinness
Book of Records.
The South African chieftain started speaking to his Kwazulu legislature on
March 12 and finally finished earlier this week. He spoke on every weekday
and notched up a total of 90 hours without repeating himself. Members of the
Kwazulu legislative assembly gave him a standing ovation when he concluded
his address which included a 60-page discussion on Inkatha's constitutional
proposals for Kwazulu/Natal.
Members of the legislative assembly were allowed to absent themselves from
proceedings if they had very urgent business, so long as a replacement was
present to take notes.
So you thought the Maastricht debate was boring?

FT  02 APR 93 / Leading Article: Cars and quotas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S agreement to cut by 9.4 per cent the export of Japanese cars and
light commercial vehicles to the European Community in 1993 provoked equal
and opposite expressions of anguish from Japan and Europe.
That may mean the negotiators, operating within the terms of a 1991
understanding, have got the deal about right. But it remains highly
unsatisfactory that the community is committed to annual quota-trading of
this kind, even if the intended goal is the desirable one of a wholly free
market by the turn of the century. It was bound to be the case that these
negotiations would lead to guesswork and anomalies.
The first guess is the size of the EC market. Officials finally agreed a
forecast of a fall in sales of 6.5 per cent from 1992 to 1993. Others
suggest the drop could be as steep as 10 per cent, which could therefore
involve Japan increasing its European market share. European manufacturers
protest that such an outcome would violate what they claim to be the spirit
of the 1991 agreement regarding the share to be taken by EC and Japanese
manufacturers of growth and contraction in the market.
Then there is the still vexed issue of Japanese-owned car manufacturing
plants in Europe, notably in Britain. Again, the EC manufacturers say that
the 1993 deal is unfair, since a drop in Japanese imports of 113,000
vehicles will be more than offset by an increase in transplant production of
at least 150,000.
In 1991 the British government ostensibly won the argument that Japanese
transplants should not affect annual import quotas. In the event, they do
seem to have been taken into account in the specific Japanese export limits
announced yesterday for the five member states which prior to 1991 operated
national restrictions on Japanese imports - France, Italy, Spain, Portugal
and the UK.
All of these countries will have to absorb a significant increase in
Japanese imports, but easily the largest is that of the UK, where the quota
rises by 20 per cent to 202,800. This presumably represents the revenge of
the European motor industry on the UK's hospitality towards Japanese vehicle
builders. It is particularly ironic that this campaign against Japanese
transplants has been joined again recently by Ford, which appears not to
recognise itself as a transplant of an earlier generation, albeit one with
significantly deeper industrial roots in Europe than the Japanese newcomers.
This is hardly a promising start for an agreement that will govern the
fortunes of the EC motor industry to the end of the decade. The more ground
given in each annual negotiation, the less likely that the objective of an
open market will be reached. Through this anti-competitive fog, the EC motor
industry is supposed to accelerate towards matching Japanese performance.
That, as this week's news from Volkswagen confirms, remains the real
endgame.

<TEXT>
THE LATEST idea being floated on Post Office privatisation looks a fairly
transparent dodge. On the one hand, the government is naturally anxious not
to be seen to be privatising another monopoly. On the other, it is publicly
committed to maintaining universal delivery. These criteria are difficult to
marry. If Royal Mail is exposed to competition in lucrative areas such as
central London, while still obliged to deliver at the same rate to Caithness
or Land's End, it cannot thrive as a commercial entity. Its sister operation
Parcelforce, which works under just such a regime, loses money.
One answer would be to set up a formal duopoly, with a commercial operator
such as TNT or DHL working alongside Royal Mail on the same terms and
obligations. But this presents the government with a familiar dilemma. The
more real the competition, the less attractive the business to the investing
public. The suggested solution is ingenious: that anyone should be free to
set up in competition to Royal Mail, provided there is the same commitment
to universal service. In formal terms, there would thus be no question of a
monopoly. But since the cost of setting up such a service nationally would
be very heavy, the prospect of a free-for-all might well deter competitors
entirely. This is a fact which the stock market, when weighing the
attractions of Royal Mail shares, would doubtless work out for itself.
On closer inspection, the whole idea is a non-starter. A regulator would
have to be appointed, whose job it would be to assess competition in real
rather than formal terms. To lure competitors in, it would be necessary to
restrict the number of licences and allow a period of transition, as with
telecommunications. The parallel can be taken further. In practice,
competition in telecoms has not meant half a dozen land lines running down
each street alongside BT's. It would be no more sensible to have half a
dozen postmen delivering alongside Royal Mail's. As with telecoms, there are
numerous points in the system at which competition can be introduced.
Duplicating the basic distribution system would be wasteful and unnecessary.
Nor is it strictly necessary that competitors should carry a universal
service obligation at all. They could compete in more lucrative areas,
provided they paid Royal Mail a fee to reflect the social cost it carries in
serving remoter regions. But these are perhaps matters of detail. The main
point is that there is much work to be done before the nature of a
privatised Post Office has been properly thought through. As it happens, it
may now be too late to include the sale in the next parliamentary session.
If so, the time can usefully be employed in returning to basics. It remains
the case that there is no objection to a privatised Post Office as a matter
of principle: rather the reverse. A sensible step would be for the
government to publish a green paper setting out the options.

FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Why property factor may harm recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JONAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'A question of confidence' (March 27), suggests that
growth in industry's output is the only plausible motor for recovery. My
experience of the fragility of confidence, gained from visiting all parts of
the UK in the past eight months, leads me to agree with you. But with one
caveat.
Industry will need to be able to raise the necessary working capital to
increase its capacity to meet any increase in demand. Recent research
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows the degree
to which UK banks have relied on the security of commercial property to
support lending to commerce generally. With property values falling and
likely to continue to do so for some time, businesses (and particularly the
smaller ones) may have difficulty in raising the short-term facilities so
necessary now.
On a tour of the US in the past week I have found a different position
there. US banks appear more ready to base their lending on their own
judgment of the business prospects of their customers. In the US there is no
longer a correlation between property values and the level of lending to
industry, whereas in Britain this is very strong.
Thus US industry does not suffer from an artificial constraint on its
facilities resulting from movements in a market often far removed from its
own. The recovery you seek will require a substantial contribution from
smaller businesses.
UK banks have a vital role as the monopoly suppliers of capital to this
sector. We must hope that they will be able to separate their often unhappy
experiences in direct property lending from this critical role in the drive
for recovery.

FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Saving for retirement should be encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL SWAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is important to provide the answer - cut from my original letter
(March 27) - to my rhetorical question on life insurance. In the context of
the high cost of selling life insurance I asked: 'Why not simply leave the
customer alone to buy or not buy if he feels the urge?' The point is
received wisdom has it that the urge will be unfelt and the product
unbought. While this would not matter if the product were a video recorder
or a box of cornflakes, given the probable collapse of the state pension
scheme it is important the public be encouraged to save for the unexpected
and retirement.

FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Economy the loser from N Sea tax change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTYN DAVID and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, ''Spoils of the North Sea' (March 29), gives welcome
prominence to the chancellor's proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime.
We would agree that the most important issue is to ensure that maximum
economic benefit is extracted from the North Sea.
However, certain points are in danger of becoming 'truths'.
First, much has been made of the refund of Pounds 200m of Petroleum Revenue
Tax (PRT) that the government made in 1991-92. This arose from treatment of
insurance in connection with a one-off anomaly - the Piper Alpha tragedy.
Second, there is no evidence that in North Sea exploration, diminishing
returns have set in. Contrary to the falling success rates quoted in your
article, the government's own Brown Book statistics show a fairly constant
success rate since the early 1970s, albeit as discoveries have become
smaller.
Finally, the polarisation of companies into winners and losers is not really
accurate. Almost any company can become a 'winner' by cutting UK
exploration.
Turning now to the main issue. The loser will be the UK economy as a whole.
The immediate effect will be felt by those companies supplying services to
the UK industry whose business will be hard hit as oil companies reduce
exploration budgets. It is unrealistic to expect them to find export markets
to fill the gap when their domestic business is destroyed at a stroke.
The proposed measure will, in the short term, result in job losses among
geological and geophysical staff, drilling contractors and others such as
helicopter pilots and the crews of support vessels. This is already
happening and many jobs will be lost as a result. In the longer term,
engineering, fabrication and supplies jobs will suffer. The number of jobs
at stake here could run into tens of thousands.
There will also be wider consequences in the longer term as drilling fewer
wells will inevitably result in less oil being found. The chancellor's
proposals quadruple the cost of exploration for oil companies in the UK.
This is true even for those companies which have been identified as
'winners' by analysts. We estimate that this could lead to at least 50 per
cent fewer wells being drilled over the next five years. At recent average
rates of success there will be about 2bn fewer barrels discovered, Pounds
2bn-Pounds 4bn less tax revenues and an adverse effect on the balance of
payments of some Pounds 20bn. This is a terrible squandering of a vital
national energy resource.
The broad thrust of the chancellor's proposals is not in the nation's or the
industry's best interests. It is too early to reduce the North Sea to the
status of a 'cash cow' for a few investors whose main attentions are turned
overseas. The future of the North Sea is characterised by smaller fields
which will not now be found or developed. The government must decide whether
it wants to see a viable and active oil province. If it does, it should
reconsider these changes.

Sir, R M Bale (Letters, March 31) asserts that railways are alone among
transport forms in requiring a state subsidy.
He has not been reading his FT closely enough: your own Richard Tomkins
demonstrated ('For whom the road tolls' February 13) how the UK road system
demands a public subsidy at least four times that of British Rail, if the
sums are done properly and environmental costs, policing, National Health
Service treatment of accidents and so on are taken into account.
Nobody has asked the improvements to the M20 to the Channel Tunnel to show a

FT  02 APR 93 / Maastricht and beyond: Denmark's prime minister outlines his
goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A green post-expressionist painting of a peasant woman peeling apples hangs
over the desk in Copenhagen of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's new prime
minister. The companiable Mr Rasmussen, who inherited the picture from Mr
Poul Schluter, his Conservative predecessor, admits he has no idea who
painted it.
Since moving in 10 weeks ago at the helm of a Social Democrat-led coalition,
Mr Rasmussen, 49, has had little time to worry about the artistic lay-out of
his office.
Taking over as head of the EC Council during Denmark's six-month Community
presidency, Mr Rasmussen has been pursuing two high-priority policies over
the Maastricht treaty. They are interlocked, yet, in a sense, opposing. Mr
Rasmussen needs Maastricht - while at the same time knowing it is becoming
increasingly unnecessary.
Mr Rasmussen owes his job to Mr Schluter's resignation over a scandal
involving the treatment of Tamil immigrants from Sri Lanka. Perhaps the new
prime minister will become Europe's first leader to face up squarely to the
post-Maastricht world. For he gives the strong impression of a man who wants
to ratify the treaty, and then discreetly put it aside.
Mr Rasmussen's first priority is to steer through approval of Maastricht in
the new Danish referendum on May 18. He describes it as 'Denmark's most
important foreign policy decision since world war two'. A renewed No would
create 'a very bad situation' for Denmark, above all by putting fresh
speculative pressure on the krone. He stops short, however, of saying it
would automatically force Denmark's departure from the EC.
His second priority concerns the condition of the EC economy. Assuming (as
he does) the treaty will surmount its ratification hurdles, Mr Rasmussen
wants the Community to move on rapidly to finding a way out of recession and
crisis. Fretting about Denmark's 12 per cent unemployment rate - and the 17m
people out of work throughout the EC - Mr Rasmussen says: 'Stagnation in
Europe is a disaster for ordinary people.'
The events of the past year - including the initial Danish No last June -
have shown, Mr Rasmussen says, that 'European leaders have been too heavily
concentrating on building European towers, before being sure that the
European foundations are well established'.
Realising the psychological importance - not least, for the currency markets
 -of a Yes vote next month, Mr Rasmussen denies that Maastricht has become
irrelevant. However, the Danes last December secured exemptions in areas
such as economic and monetary union (Emu), defence and EC citizenship,
which, for Denmark at least, denude the treaty of its principal
significance.
These opt-outs, Mr Rasmussen forecasts, will win over enough Danish
Euro-sceptics to deliver 'a clear Yes' in the referendum. Yet he says it is
not Denmark, but other EC countries, which have been 'opting out of reality'
by trying to push forward European integration too fast.
In view of the EC recession, and the prolonged structural crisis in eastern
Europe, Mr Rasmussen believes some basic premises behind the quest for
deeper integration have lost their validity.
'Political leaders can find themselves in a situation where the basis on
which they took decisions becomes outdated. They have no choice but to put
into effect what they decided - and then take new decisions.'
Asked whether he fears that the rest of the Community will forge ahead to
Emu without Denmark, Mr Rasmussen, uncharacteristically, pauses, then
replies: 'Experience has shown that economic and political developments are
always taking directions which are not foreseen. You could say it is of
interest to discuss where Europe will be in six years' time - from an
intellectual, from a political or journalistic point of view. But what we
need is not to discuss developments for the year 2000. I'm in favour of
concrete decisions concerning those 17m (unemployed) people in 1993-94.'
Once uncertainty over Maastricht's ratification is resolved - assuming no
further setbacks in the UK - Mr Rasmussen wants the EC's Copenhagen summit
in June to decide selective economic expansion.
This would include further spending on infrastructure programmes, extending
the extra funding by the European Investment Bank decided at the December
summit in Edinburgh. He also supports more help for eastern Europe, and
wants to establish an EC fund to provide western companies with guarantees
against losses from investments there.
Because EC companies are operating well below capacity, Mr Rasmussen
believes higher economic growth need not be inflationary.
Mr Rasmussen's vision of Europe's economic future clearly involves activism,
though of a cerebral kind. 'We shall compete on the most advanced level of
science, education and competence, service, quality and delivery.
He bristles at mention of the Maastricht fiscal targets, laid down to guide
the path towards Emu. Do these not preclude any generalised budgetary effort
to stimulate growth? Mr Rasmussen replies that the recession is pushing up
budget deficits well beyond the benchmark set in the Maastricht treaty of 3
per cent of gross domestic product.
This means that EC governments must accept short-run divergences from the
Emu track. 'Stagnation can never be the answer to the wish for convergence.
Stagnation is the way to greater disparities.'
After several years of orthodox fiscal and monetary policies and low growth,
Denmark has greatly improved its budgetary position, and is running a
substantial current account surplus. Yet its own ability to stimulate the
economy is constrained. Although it rules out taking part in Emu, it is one
of the few EC countries close to fulfilling the Emu targets. Yet opting out
of Emu has put the krone under sporadic pressure, reflecting currency
markets' belief that Denmark's political attachment to European parities is
weaker than that of, say, France.
Mindful of these doubts, Mr Rasmussen pledges to maintain the krone's
exchange rate. A British-style bid to seek growth by devaluation would be
'the most negative answer you can ever dream of'. Yet the cost of keeping
the krone stable is reflected in short-term interest rates about five
percentage points above German levels.
One weighty reason why Mr Rasmussen is looking forward to a Yes on May 18 is
because he thinks that Denmark, shortly afterwards, will be able to reduce
interest rates towards German levels.
Mr Rasmussen is convinced that his policies will bring dividends - for
Denmark and for Europe. 'I am an optimistic nature, I'm a happy boy - I
always have been. The prime minister here is in good shape and wants to take
decisions.' In today's Europe, a Danish prime minister has only limited
freedom of manoeuvre. But Mr Rasmussen is determined to exploit it to the
full.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In theory we PR fanatics should be wildly excited at the news that the
Labour party may be about to hoist the flag of electoral reform, a cause I
have supported all my life. Britain's method of electing its MPs is a
turn-off to many able individuals who might otherwise choose a career in
politics. It has produced a disastrous succession of elective dictatorships
that have shuffled us towards the despondent last decade of a century of
relative decline. First-past-the-post? Phooey. That discredited mech- anism
produced the dross that has governed us for most of the years since 1945.
Even the Italians, who are talking about abandoning their excessively
proportional system, do not appear likely to take our poison undiluted.
The key words in the above little outburst are 'in theory'. If Labour goes
into the next election on a platform that includes fair voting for the House
of Commons (and any system would be fairer than the present
winner-takes-all) it will deserve to win. This is not to say that it will do
so. On present form it looks set for a fifth election defeat, ex or cum a
new system of voting. A possible policy change by a natural party of
opposition does not quicken anyone's pulse.
Let's make it simple. Almost exactly a year ago Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour
party - reformed, tarted-up, smiling and eager - scored less than 35 per
cent of the vote. You may analyse the reasons until kingdom come, or, if you
want a little longer, until the opinion polls are trusted once again. The
answer will always be the same: Labour was perceived to be a party of the
past, in hock to the trade unions, more likely to smother enterprise than to
respond to the aspirations of ordinary people. The south of England and even
some Scottish constituencies rejected it.
If the same perception holds when the next election comes in 1996 or 1997
the party will be rejected once again. Even the present sorry lot of
Conservatives will win, even if Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, cuts a
deal with Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. This was not how it seemed
in the summer of 1987, when my simple-minded analysis of the arithmetic of
Lady Thatcher's victory that year led to the conclusion that what Labour had
to do to earn the electorate's trust was adopt PR. The experiment was not
tried, although there was a last-minute fumble during the April 1992
campaign. Rest assured, if the PR card had been played properly it would
have made little difference. Southerners would not have voted Liberal
Democrat if they thought that the result would be a Labour government, alone
or in coalition. Labour was not wanted, period.
Mr Smith is aware of this, but insufficiently so. Labour's 'modernisers', of
whom Mr Tony Blair is the outstanding example, know that what is required is
a repositioning of the party in the political marketplace. This must mean
severing formal ties with the trade unions, ditching the language of
socialism from Labour's constitution, and, where principle permits, adopting
a strategy of outflanking the Conservatives by attacking from the
pro-competition, pro-consumer right. Mr Smith is a compromiser on the trade
unions, indifferent to the argument about clause 4 of the party constitution
(the one that implies renationalisation) and not always alive to the many
opportunities that exist to dish the Conservatives with their own medicine.
What Labour needs is a few pieces of theatre that break through the glass
wall of resistance to politics. Mr Smith must establish a new picture of his
party in the electorate's mind. For example, why not sue the government for
failing to report the electricity generating duopoly to the monopolies and
mergers commission? It would certainly get Labour's name in the papers.
The chances are that a row over electoral reform will provide moments of
drama; what remains to be seen is whether Mr Smith plays these to advantage.
Lord Plant's commission on electoral reform, set up by Mr Kinnock, has voted
by a narrow margin in favour of the 'supplementary vote' for elections to
the commons. The second preferences of the also-rans in any constituency
would be distributed among the two front-runners. In 1992 that might have
returned most existing Labour MPs while throwing out a dozen or more
Conservatives and putting Liberal Democrats in their place. The result would
have been a hung parliament.
The Plant proposals will go to Labour's national executive at the end of the
month. If they are not thrown out there Mr Smith will find it difficult to
avoid endorsing them. The party will then be called upon to do likewise at
its conference in the autumn. Mr Smith's deputy, Mrs Margaret Beckett, may
be relied upon to fight this all the way. She will have powerful allies.
Reformers, perhaps led by Mr Robin Cook, will fight equally hard. The Labour
boss can choose: either he acts as the soothing party manager, easing
through the least disruptive package, or he stands on principle, staking his
reputation on the result.
He is likely to choose a neat way out. He will propose a referendum on the
voting system, leaving it to the people to decide. That is a reasonable
method of keeping the party united.
A referendum would anyway be necessary before such an important
constitutional change. Yet this device does nothing for the image of the
leader or the party unless Mr Smith indicates how he himself will campaign
and vote on the issue.
Now for a succession of ifs. If Mr Smith makes a show of principle on fair
voting for the Commons, and if Labour heavily promotes the rest of its
package of constitutional reform (a PR-elected senate to replace the House
of Lords, PR-elected regional assemblies and members of the European
parliament, a Bill of Rights . . . ) it will have a package that would
distinguish it from the Conservatives, attract some Liberals, and tempt a
thin slice of voters from all other parties.
We come at last to the biggest if of them all. If Mr Smith has correctly
repositioned his party then all the constitutional reforms listed above
would be a bonus that might tip the balance. If Labour is still seen as
out-of-date, cloth-cap, the Woolworths party, the party of canals in the age
of Cortinas, it will lose even if it offers a perfect electoral reform
package to the accompaniment of praises sung by angels.

<TEXT>
Sir, Dominic Lawson ('The horror of dead children', March 27) overlooks the
fact that one of the men shot in Northern Ireland was a member of the IRA.
The children were not. The deaths do not equate. In the week that the
children were being buried it was a very insensitive article.

FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Innovative thinking needed on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD DEWAR MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in the report of a speech I made at the weekend
('Ministers look at ways to cut invalidity cash', March 29).
I raised a number of questions at the conference. One was whether the
problem of poverty in retirement could be solved purely by raising the basic
state retirement pension. If the answer is no then clearly thought has to be
given as to how additional support can most effectively be provided.
These are highly relevant questions as this government insists that the
value of the basic state pension will not be raised in real terms. That is
why it is currently worth only 15 per cent of male average earnings and
continuing to fall.
Labour has recognised the need for innovative thinking in the field of
pensions and social security with the setting up of the Commission on Social
Justice. It is important that discussion is based on the practicalities of
the situation. The questions I asked - and they were not assertions - were a
contribution to that process.

FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Eliot Gardiner and the Philharmonia - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was difficult to tell why there were empty seats at this concert at the
Royal Festival Hall. Perhaps some people had been put off by the advertised
programme and others turned away in disappointment when it was changed, for
this Philharmonia concert had undergone more wholesale transpositions than
an ageing prima donna's songbook.
Suffice to say that the original and rather adventurous plan to give us
Mozart and Britten (Act 2 of Gloriana and the Spring Symphony) evaporated
some weeks ago into an Elgar symphony and a Beethoven concerto, but by the
time the audience had settled into their seats the concerto had gone as
well. The evening's soloist had been taken ill. In her place John Eliot
Gardiner had been persuaded to take the orchestra through Beethoven's
Seventh Symphony - on no rehearsal.
No doubt the Philharmonia Orchestra could play this symphony on autopilot
anyway. But Gardiner is not the sort of conductor to let an orchestra get
away with that. If they really had not had any rehearsals for this
performance, the players were in for a surprise. He set a galloping fast
tempo for the main Allegro of the first movement (no easy matter to keep
dotted rhythms clear at that speed) and after that the symphony never
stopped for breath.
The importance of Gardiner - and the reason why a traditional orchestra like
the Philharmonia is well advised to get him on board its roster of
conductors - is that he has the will and the intelligence not just to go
along with accepted notions of how well-known pieces of music should be
played. The Beethoven may only have been an outline of a performance, but it
was stamped with his own personality. His Elgar after the interval was
wholly original, unidiomatic perhaps, but unforgettable.
Coming from working with early music, Gardiner approaches late 19th-century
orchestral works with different expectations. He wants clarity of sound and
precision, not grandiloquence (the Philharmonia pinned down inner parts
astonishingly for him). In shaping the music, he is not content to take the
long view; every single phrase has to be given its own meaning.
The result was a performance of Elgar's Second Symphony that had more to say
about the music than any other I have encountered. Instead of vague romantic
gestures, it seemed to speak urgently of personal passion and the gathering
storm-clouds of the First World War, the latter in a fearsomely articulated
scherzo. Forget Tate's rather bloated Elgar and Sinopoli's debilitating
efforts with the same orchestra. Gardiner is the new, thinking Elgarian for
the 1990s.

FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Wolfe in Papp's clothing - The row over the
controversial changes at the New York Shakespeare Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The honeymoon never even started for JoAnne Akalaitis, Joseph Papp's
successor as artistic director of the New York Shakespeare Festival. The
festival's board of directors brought Akalaitis' rocky 20-month tenure to a
sudden end last month when it voted unanimously to remove her from her
position and to replace her with George C. Wolfe, who has been a resident
director at the festival since 1990.
Thirty-eight-year-old Wolfe will take the title of producer and oversee both
the theatre's business dealings and its artistic affairs, responsibilities
split between Akalaitis and producing director, Jason Steven Cohen, when
Papp gave over responsibility of the theatre two months before his death in
October, 1991. Actor Kevin Kline, long associated with the festival, has
been appointed an artistic associate.
Wolfe is one of America's hottest young theatre artists and a widely-popular
choice to lead the festival. His writing and directing credits include The
Colored Museum, Spunk and Jelly's Last Jam; he is currently directing the
Broadway premiere of Tony Kushner's Angels in America. While Wolfe's
dynamism and charisma make him a natural leader and will serve him well in
the public relations and fund-raising aspects of his new position, his only
hands-on producing experience to date is an annual festival of solo
performers of colour for the Shakespeare Festival.
Larry Condon, the chairman of the festival board's executive committee, said
that the changeover was part of 'a long-range effort to reshape the
institution for the future . . . we decided that we needed to reach back
into the theatre's roots and bring in a single leader who will serve the
broad producer functions as well as artistic ones. JoAnne is a wonderful
director and cares a lot about the theatre but, having made the decision to
re-organise the institution, JoAnne was not the first choice.'
Akalaitis' supporters maintain that she should have been allowed at least
the duration of her first contract - three years - to put her imprint on the
festival and that her termination was handled in a peremptory, disrespectful
manner.
Akalaitis, a founding member of the avant-garde theatre company, Mabou
Mines, has never been involved in running a large institution before she
took over the festival. Many, while acknowledging that other factors,
including the recession, were also at play, blame her lack of business
acumen for the theatre's recent fiscal woes. In the last three years, the
festival's annual budget has been cut by more than one-third to under
Dollars 10m, the staff cut in half to 60, and the subscription audience has
dropped from 3,500 to 2,000.
Her programming has also come under fire. While the festival has added
several successful new projects, including a puppetry festival, and has
given producing space to several small theatre companies under her tenure,
many maintain that the company, by relying on co-productions and productions
brought from other theatres, is failing in its brief to generate new
projects. That a Shakespeare production was not included mainstage this year
was a particular sticking-point for Akalaitis critics.
While the festival's offerings this year have been never less than
interesting, they have all been of a grim sameness. They include Texts for
Nothing, Beckett's paeon to existential angst; Akalaitis' icy production of
Buchner's Woyzeck; Steve Tesich's partly-pretentious, partly-profound
post-apocalyptical drama, On the Open Road; a chamber musical, Wings, about
a stroke victim; Marisol, Jose Rivera's darkly-poetic expose of contemporary
urban life; and Kushner's brilliant Aids rant, Angels in America, which the
festival is co-producing on Broadway.
Clearly, Akalaitis walked into a near-impossible position when she took over
an institution so closely identified with its idiosyncratic founder. Under
Joe Papp's 37-year leadership the Shakespeare Festival produced over 400
plays and musicals and earned 28 Tony Awards, three Pulitzer Prizes, and
nearly 100 Obie (off-Broadway) Awards; noteworthy productions under Papp's
leadership include A Chorus Line, Four Colored Girls .., The Mystery of
Edwin Drood and the annual free summertime productions of Shakespeare in
Central Park.
Whatever her failings and strengths, Akalaitis became the scapegoat and
eventually the victim of the inevitably-difficult post-Papp transition
period. It is probably small consolation to her at this point, but by
absorbing hostilities, earned and unearned, Akalaitis helped clear the road
to the institution's future.

If you are at all interested in old and much loved vehicles and missed any
of the Perpetual Motion series on their first screening, the repeats (8.00
BBC2) are well worth catching. Today's programme celebrates the Morris
Minor, now one of the trendiest cars, at least in such places as north-west
London, even though (or perhaps because) they are all over 20 years old. The
continuing expansion of television and the consequent need for more and more
programme material seems pretty clear when you find Channel 4 offering not
one but two cookery series dedicated exclusively to vegetables. Grow Your
Greens which starts tonight (9.00) runs in harness with 'Eat Your Greens',
beginning on Wednesday. Cookery writer Sophie Grigson, daughter of Jane,
presents both. BBC1's new six-part drama about English class divisions, The
Riff Raff Element, is written by Debbie Horsfield, author of 'Making Out',
the series about women in a Liverpool electronics factory. The new series
pairs up the Tundish family of Tundish Hall with the Belchers, whose
principal source of income, we are told, is burglary(9.30).

FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Ricochet - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are you, like me, a sucker for murder stories? If so, you will be happy to
see the following newspaper advert on the posters and programmes for Malcolm
Taylor's new play Ricochet: 'PERFECT murderer offers Pounds 10,000 to
equally perfect murderer. Box No 3049.' The advert has been placed by Lord
Qualtrop; but for what reasons? It is answered by one Inspector Sparrow; but
what kind of inspector is he? He is greeted by the butler Disraeli; and what
kind of butler is he? Which of the three is a killer? Who will get killed?
Surprise caps surprise caps surprise caps surprise. The audience laughs more
often than it squeals. What larks]
Bath's Theatre Royal is filled by an audience that wants larks of these kind
 -and wants to see Nigel Havers and Keith Barron. Like people all around me,
I left the theatre with my head buzzing with the play's circuitous
intricacies; and I make tactful efforts now to give none of them away. The
play often has comic lines of an exquisitely sinister nuance. The inspector
says to the butler, ''The butler did it.' Have you ever done it?' The butler
replies, 'That's for me to know, Sir, and you to discover.'
The second inspector says to a suspect 'I wouldn't try anything. I got
passed over for promotion this morning.' And yet I felt no concern for any
character onstage; worse, no great sense of suspense; worst, no awareness
that murder is evil. True, one character sometimes says that murder must go
punished because it wrecks the lives of the living - but this attitude does
not prevail.
A comedy is not much of a comedy if it does not take something seriously -
in this case, murder. And a thriller is not much of a thriller if it it is
mainly conceived as a you'll-never-guess-what-happens-next joke. The point
of Ricochet is merely to manipulate its audience. In this respect it
succeeds cleverly enough - though its plot will bear little scrutiny for
either probability or logic. But Sleuth and Deathtrap took murder more
seriously, and thereby were more riveting and more fun. Ricochet amounts to
nothing but gameplaying. The taste that leaves is unpleasant.
Part of the gameplaying - this is hard to explain without explaining too
much - involves the roles. If there were one reason I might want to watch
Ricochet again, it would be to re-examine the acting that leads up to the
big unmasking halfway through Act Two. Nigel Havers and Neil Stacy, as Lord
Qualtrop and Bulstrode, execute one piece of virtuosity each that is
impressive afterwards, once you know what it was. But at the time it is
actually rather laboured and indistinct.
Havers's role is otherwise the usual engaging Havers exercise in classy
charm. Out of practice as a stage actor, he shows no great mastery of stage
projection, dynamics or pacing, but will doubtless gain more authority with
further performances. I note also that he is one of the two directors of
Havahall Pictures, which co-presents this play. David Taylor directs. Keith
Barron gives a performance that is absolutely right for the play - deft,
convincing moment by moment in an ambiguous way, lightweight.
At the Theatre Royal, Bath, until April 3

FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Premiere of Matthus's 'Gewandhaus Symphony' - Music in
Leipzig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first there were just 16 musicians, standing alone on the concert
platform. Before long they had become a classical orchestra, which in turn
grew to Straussian proportions. At the final count, there were nearly 200
musicians. That, in short, is the story of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra,
which has just celebrated its 250th anniversary. It is also the story of
Siegfried Matthus' new Gewandhaus Symphony, the premiere of which was the
focus of the anniversary celebrations.
Leipzig may not boast the oldest orchestra in the world - that honour
belongs to Dresden - but it does have Germany's oldest concert orchestra.
The Gewandhaus Orchestra, named after the hall of the clothmakers' guild,
was founded in 1743 on the private initiative of 16 wealthy burghers, eager
to sustain a musical tradition bequeathed by Bach, Telemann and their
medieval forebears. Today the orchestra is the focal point of the city's
musical life, playing in the Thomaskirche, the opera house and the handsome
Gewandhaus concert hall, which opened in 1981 as a replacement for its
war-bombed predecessor.
In the intervening 250 years, the Gewandhaus Orchestra has made music with
Mozart, Mendelssohn and Wagner, attracted chief conductors of the calibre of
Nikisch, Furtwangler and Bruno Walter, and premiered such pillars of the
repertoire as Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, Mendelssohn's Scottish
Symphony, Schubert's Great C major Symphony and Brahms' German Requiem. It
has remained the most distinctly classical-sounding of German orchestras - a
sound nurtured by its own music school, which continues to supply many of
its players. Since unification it has lost not a single musician, despite
lucrative job opportunities further west.
Tradition constantly renewing itself was the leitmotif of the anniversary
celebrations. Kurt Masur, chief conductor since 1970, opened the birthday
concert with a robust account of the Meistersinger overture (another work
premiered by the orchestra), followed by a contemporary homage to Bach in
Sofia Gubaidulina's Offertorium - with Gidon Kremer, like some musical
acupuncturist, pinpointing all the nerve-ends of the solo violin part.
Then came Matthus' 45-minute symphony, scored for large orchestra, soprano,
boys' voices and organ. It is a gargantuan piece d'occasion, in which
Matthus - east Germany's leading composer and a longstanding friend of Masur
 -has attempted to turn Gewandhaus history into music. He incorporates the
orchestra's growth into the four-movement structure, pays tribute to various
musical epochs along the way, throws in references to the orchestra's role
in the Bach revival and the downfall of Communism (when the Gewandhaus
became a forum for political discussion), and ends on a utopian note.
As a technical tour de force, the symphony has an oddball fascination. In
the opening concerto grosso movement, Matthus cleverly evokes the spirit of
Bach in a modern sound world; in a scherzo of daunting rhythmic complexity,
he whips the musical argument round a huge orchestra like a breakneck
conversational chain; the final passacaglia, dominated by organ and a
phalanx of brass, rises to a massive climax without a hint of pomposity.
Even so, the symphony has a hollow ring. By trying to cram so much in,
Matthus allows extra-musical factors to dictate the work's character: the
only development is numerical. The music has a piecemeal quality, shot
through with faded modernist colouring which hardly raises the spirit.
Matthus apparently intends to adapt the symphony for more conventional
forces. But stripped of the theatricals (and of the boys' chorus linking
each movement while the stage fills up), it is hard to imagine the
Gewandhaus Symphony thriving far beyond its illustrious namesake.

FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: All spun silk and gold - The Elizabeth Hoare Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1902, a 22-year old architect, Giles Gilbert Scott, won the competition
to design Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Too few people discover the
austere majesty of Scott's Gothic cathedral, one of the largest in the world
and one of the outstanding British buildings of this century. A new museum
has now opened actually inside the cathedral, high above in the right
gallery - properly, the triforium. From the Elizabeth Hoare Gallery,
visitors enjoy a dizzying view of Scott's masterpiece. However, the real
purpose of this unique museum is to celebrate an aspect of Victorian
craftsmanship and design which has hitherto been disastrously neglected.
Thanks to the Elizabeth Hoare Collection, Liverpool now boasts the only
permanent display of classic Victorian and Edwardian embroidery in the
country. The collection is beautifully displayed, a real feast for the eyes.
Sumptuous velvet vestments and altar-frontals glow in deep-dyed hues of
indigo, green, violet and red. Embroideries gleam with artfully stitched
gold thread, made in true medieval fashion, by wrapping gold leaf around
spun silk. Samplers demonstrate the marvellous effects from floss silk and
gold thread.
The museum is truly a window onto a forgotten aspect of Victorian emulation
of the past. In the 1830s and 1840s, first the birth of the Oxford Movement
and then Augustus Pugin's championing of medieval designs, paved the way for
a magnificent flowering of ecclesiastical embroidery. Church furnishings was
a lively issue, and not just in the pages of The Ecclesiologist. The
collection takes the story on as far as the 1940s and '50s. Modern design
may be more austere, yet the specimens from the Hoare Collection and the
cathedral's own are a million miles from the amateurish monstrosities which
disgrace so many parish churches and cathedrals.
Admittedly, ecclesiastical embroidery might sound impossibly arcane.
However, there is a lot more to Liverpool's newest museum. It could be said
to be the nearest thing Britain yet has to a museum of women's art. Many
things remain to be discovered about the world of the Victorian
embroiderers, but it is probably true that most of these pieces were
designed by male architects. At the same time, the actual work of embroidery
is thought to have been women's work, done by skilful lady amateurs who
eagerly joined embroidery gilds as well as by female outworkers working for
the flourishing commercial firms.
Anglican 19th-century nuns, like their medieval forbears, fashioned
vestments for the bishop and exquisite furnishings for God's house. One of
the most superb pieces in the exhibition is a frontal designed by GE Street
and made by the nuns of St Margaret's Convent, East Grinstead. Everyone
remembers that one of Mr Gladstone's interests was rescuing fallen women and
it is piquant to discover that some of them would have ended up in convent
workshops, learning how to bring a faint blush to the cheeks of virgin
saints.
The very survival of this unique collection is due to the vision and energy
of businesswoman Elizabeth Hoare. She began in the early 1960s, when it
would have been difficult to think of a more unfashionable area to collect.
However, Mrs Hoare's interest was both professionally and aesthetically
motivated - indeed, one might even say it was genetic.
In 1874, the firm of Watts &amp; Co. was founded by three well-known architects,
G. F. Bodley, Thomas Garner and George Gilbert Scott, to make fine
furnishings for houses and churches. ('What's in a name' was said to have
been the origin of the name, since for gentlemen architects to put their
name to a shop seemed not quite respectable.) Mrs Hoare is the granddaughter
of Scott the elder and therefore the niece of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect
of Liverpool Cathedral. After an early career as an actress, she took over
the firm after the war and has been fitting out bishops and altars ever
since.
In the 1960s and '70s, the era of the beige, homespun look, it seemed that a
new age of iconoclasm had come upon the church in England. Vicars everywhere
were throwing out Victorian chasubles and frontals, convent workrooms were
closed down, and a quantity of Victorian embroidery ended up in the dustbin
or on the bonfire. In the course of her work in churches, Mrs Hoare was able
to rescue several hundred pieces. They rarely cost her more than the (often
not inconsiderable) effort of carrying them back on the train.
For years, Hoare's Bank in Fleet Street stored the bulky collection in its
vaults. However, the owner always hoped to find a permanent home, partly
from a deep conviction that modern embroiderers lack opportunity to study
what is best in the English tradition. Four years ago, Liverpool Cathedral
ordered some copes from Watts, unaware of the family connection with its own
architect. The offer was made, and to their great credit the cathedral
authorities reacted enthusiastically.
Funds for the transformation of the first triforium (it is hoped that the
second may eventually be used) were raised privately. Donors include; The
Clothworkers' Foundation, Peter Moores Foundation, Ecclesiastical Insurance
Group, and Commercial Union, among others. The tide may have turned; this
long neglected art may yet be appreciated as one of the high points of
English craftsmanship.

FT  02 APR 93 / People: Heavyweights within its aegis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Law, septuagenarian former deputy chairman of NFC who took over as
non-executive chairman of Aegis last September, has managed to persuade two
respected figures from British industry and finance to join the board of the
troubled media-buying agency that moved its headquarters to Paris last
summer.
The arrival of Sir Peter Thompson, ex-chairman of NFC and founder chairman
of ProShare - which aims to encourage wider share ownership - plus Sir Kit
McMahon, formerly deputy chairman of the Bank of England and chairman of
Midland Bank, marks an attempt to restore the reputation of the once
high-flying media stock, which, aside from its financial woes, has managed a
poor record of corporate governance.
Law points out that he was hitherto the only non-executive on the 10-man
board - the other nine directors being all either executives of the company
or representatives of the two major shareholders, one French and one
American. 'It was sometimes a little lonely,' he remarks.
Sir Peter (pictured right) he knows well. As a founder of the company that
became NFC, Law says he played a part in his promotion to chief executive of
what proved to be the government's most successful MBO. He met Sir Kit
through Midland Bank.
Rather than the board interviewing the candidates, Aegis' troubles meant
that it was McMahon and Thompson who were given the opportunity to grill
anyone they wished in the company, for however long - and on their own.
Meanwhile, last summer's move to France unsettled UK institutions, not least
because it removed Aegis from the jurisdiction of the Takeover Panel.
Hence one crucial task for the new directors, who join in May, will be to
help the company make up its mind how to address these institutional
concerns.
Given that Law is in his 78th year, there is also the question of who will
be the next chairman.
Analysts expect that Aegis, which reports on Tuesday, will unveil
restructuring costs for 1992 that will more or less cancel out operating
profits of some Pounds 50m.
The share price, roughly 120p a year ago, collapsed over the summer, and
dipped as low as 13p earlier this year. Yesterday it edged up 2p to 19p.

FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: US puts the emphasis on quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the US is to compete with Japan and Europe, it must create a 'national
quality centre' to co-ordinate the dissemination of total quality management
technologies to industries throughout the country, the Washington-based
Council on Competitiveness said this week.
In a new report*, the Council said that although TQM is now widely
recognised in business as a national priority, individual corporations do
not have sufficient resources alone 'to meet the aggregate US demand for
quality education and information'.
The Council - whose members are drawn from industry, academia and labour and
who helped produce the Clinton administration's technology policy - said
Japan's Union of Scientists and Engineers (Juse) could serve as a model for
a new systematic approach to 'quality diffusion'.
Juse is a non-profit group of corporations which work together with leading
universities to promote quality improvement throughout Japanese industry.
With its extensive national network of companies, it conducts research,
promotes quality practices and provides training in quality to workers and
managers.
Ray Stata, chief executive of Analog Devices and a member of the Council on
Competitiveness Executive Committee, sees a Juse-like organisation as key to
accelerating US quality improvement.
The world economy is 'in the midst of a transition in which competition has
become more acute,' he said. 'To some extent, it's them - Japan and Europe -
or us. We must find more efficient technologies for handling human
resources.'
In Japan TQM is regularly deployed throughout the company; in the US this is
true in only a few firms. Japanese industry has ongoing national programmes
to raise quality consciousness in society; Juse's 'QC Circles' focuses the
activities of small groups of workers continuously improving and problem
solving.
The adoption of TQM techniques requires a significant change in US corporate
culture. US companies have learned from the Japanese example that they have
to work together. 'Ten years ago, in our company and in others, if we found
a new way of managing, we would consider that a trade secret,' said Stata.
'But US industry has never been in this kind of a jam before.'

The world's smallest instant camera is how Polaroid describes Vision, a
folding camera with a window on the back through which the photographer can
see the developing picture.
Polaroid has shrunk the camera by incorporating the functions carried out by
seven chips into a single micro-controller. The in-built flash emits a brief
range-finding beam as the shutter release is pressed, to determine the
distance of the object while the micro-controller calculates the best
exposure from information on ambient and infra-red light. The picture size
has also shrunk. The cost of each photo is Pounds 1. Polaroid: UK, 0727

Although competition between telephone companies has slashed the prices for
digital telephone lines, many business exchanges, or PABXs, are unable to
connect to the services.
Gandalf, the Canadian communications company, has developed a device to
enable companies with 15 phone lines or more to reduce their bills by
switching to ISDN (integrated services digital network).
The Access ISDN links analogue and non-ISDN digital PABXs - which account
for 90 per cent of all private exchanges in the UK - to ISDN networks. The
device, developed for the UK's Post Office, also makes it easy to switch
between different phone companies to take advantage of the cheapest rates.

With the proliferation of personal computers the role of the traditional
data processing department is increasingly coming under scrutiny.
One particular problem, says Bob Zawacki, professor of management and
international business at the University of Colorado, is that computer staff
are highly motivated, but poor at the social skills needed to handle
customers.
Zawacki's research is being used by KPMG Management Consulting as a basis
for its People Performance service, which aims to improve the performance of
computer staff by up to 30 per cent by assessing their performance against a
list of indicators. KPMG: UK, 071 236 8000.

FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: Paying the price of congestion - Electronic road
charging may be operating in London by the end of the decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could London become the first city in Europe to charge drivers for using its
streets on a pay-as-you-go basis?
The prospect loomed a little closer this week when John MacGregor, Britain's
transport secretary, unveiled the results of a long-awaited study into the
technological options for introducing electronic road pricing to the
capital.
Although at pains to emphasise that no firm decisions on road pricing had
yet been taken, MacGregor seemed happy to acknowledge that it could be in
operation in the capital by the end of the decade.
'We have to consider new ways of preventing road congestion in London from
getting worse as car ownership grows,' MacGregor said.
At present, there is no city in the world operating a fully fledged system
of road pricing to control congestion. Singapore has come closest to it;
people driving into the central area at peak periods are required to buy and
display a licence that is physically checked on entry.
A system like that would clearly be impractical in a city as large as London
because of the number of entry points involved and the very large number of
vehicles crossing them each day. So the Department of Transport has
commissioned the University of Newcastle upon Tyne to investigate electronic
alternatives.
According to Peter Hills, the university's professor of transport
engineering, the technology of automatic revenue collection from vehicles is
moving fast. So far, however, it has been applied mainly to the collection
of tolls on motorways and bridges.
The first-generation technology - the most widespread currently in use -
comprises read-only tags. These are simple electronic cards containing an
identification code that can be read by a roadside device. Charges are
clocked up against owners and are either debited from a pre-paid account or
collected later by sending a bill. This system is simple, cheap and
reliable. However, it is doubtful whether it would be suitable for city use:
vehicles would have to pass the reading device slowly and in single file and
enforcing payment could prove troublesome. Some people would object that the
system could enable vehicle movements to be traced.
The second-generation devices, known as read-and-write tags, differ in
providing an element of two-way communication: they can receive information
from the roadside reader and store it. This means card holders can extract a
log of recent transactions and check how much money is left in their
accounts, which might enhance acceptability: but otherwise, it would suffer
all the disadvantages of the first-generation systems if applied to a city
road pricing scheme.
The third-generation devices are in a different league altogether. Here, the
intelligence is transferred from the roadside equipment to the in-car
device. Vehicles would be fitted with meters which would be activated by
microwave signals emitted by roadside beacons once they entered the charging
zone. The meter would deduct payments from a rechargeable smart card
inserted into the device by the driver at the beginning of the journey.
Drivers penetrating the charging zone without a functioning meter (or a
temporary substitute for visitors) would have their licence plates
photographed by roadside cameras and face punishment at a later date.
Advantages of this sort of system include its ability to operate at high
vehicle speeds (up to 70mph) and in multi-lane traffic. It also assures
anonymity for users, as long as they obey the rules.
More significantly still, the system has many applications beyond road
pricing. For example, the roadside beacons could be used to transmit traffic
information to the in-car meters, and the smart cards could be used to pay
for travel on public transport.
The principle disadvantage of third-generation systems is that none has yet
been developed to the point where it is ready to be put into use. But this
could quickly change. As part of an EC project under the Drive-II programme
examining how information technology can help solve transport problems,
trials of charging systems are already planned or under way in five European
cities, including Cambridge in the UK.
One of the chief objectives of this programme is to evolve common standards
for third-generation, road-pricing technology, so avoiding a proliferation
of incompatible systems. It would, after all, be nonsensical if motorists
had to fit their vehicles with a different communication system to suit
every conurbation they envisaged driving in.
To some, electronic road charging may still have an air of science fiction
about it. But the technology exists: all that remains now, according to
Hills, is for the private sector to come forward and develop it into a
marketable state. Given the multi-billion dollar market awaiting the company
that successfully does so, that may not be as great a hurdle as it appears.

FT  02 APR 93 / People: Cullimore to exploit Naafi challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Cullimore, who ran the Dewhurst chain of butchers for more than 20
years, has become chairman of Naafi, succeeding Sir Malcolm Field, group
managing director of WH Smith, who has inhabited the voluntary post for the
past seven years.
'Originally there was no thought of my becoming chairman,' says Cullimore,
who is 61 and joined the board in 1984, 'as they would normally look for
someone younger.' But with the impact of Options for Change, under which
almost half the British soldiers stationed in Germany (Naafi's most
profitable area) are to return to the UK, the need was felt for an
experienced hand to guide the institution through one of the biggest changes
since its founding in 1921.
As well as his retailing experience, Cullimore, who served in the parachute
regiment in Cyprus and the Canal Zone in the mid 1950s, has kept close
contact with the Services.
Naafi, the official trading organisation of the Forces, which sees an annual
turnover of Pounds 430m, gets no money from the government - unlike the
situation in other countries - and aims to return a surplus (Pounds 16m last
year) to Service welfare funds.
'With a much more sophisticated customer base, there is actually no longer a
need for the Naafi in much of the UK,' says Cullimore, 'but there is a
desperate need for it in Benbecular or Northern Ireland.'
One way to make money - and support the loss-making welfare operations such
as Bosnia - will be to expand the nascent financial services division.
'Servicemen worried about anything from motor insurance to investing
redundancy money feel they can trust us. This is an area with tremendous
growth potential.'

He had held the post since July 1988 when BM reorganised following the
acquisition of Tod and of Beazer Products and Services. Since then the group
acquired Blackwood Hodge in autumn 1990 and Thomas Robinson early last year.
His departure, to take place between now and June, is part of the shake-up
at BM after the collapse in its performance and share price triggered by the
departure of founding chairman Roger Shute last June.
BM, which made a record Pounds 34.6m pre-tax profit in 1991-92, announced
nearly Pounds 42m of restructuring costs and write-offs on Wednesday. It is
in discussions with its bankers over breaches of covenant and a programme of
debt reduction.

Towering over the Warnow shipyard in the east German state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern stands a large cable crane, a monument to the big is
beautiful school of communist management.
Driven by up to 24 women operators in cabins suspended across the Baltic
skyline, the crane can hoist 50,000 tonnes of steel. Workers still marvel at
its size and power, though the truth is that its technology was out of date
the day it arrived in 1955.
For Otto Soberg, the cable crane is a reminder of the scale of his
management challenge. A well-groomed, confident, 36-year-old, he is the new
chief executive installed by Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipbuilder, to turn
round Warnow, near the town of Rostock.
Shipbuilding is the sole industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a rural region
which ranks among the poorest in Germany. Largely created in 1945 to build
ships for the former Soviet Union as part of war reparations, the industry
was left to fend for itself after the initial post-second world war
investment. For Kvaerner, Warnow offers a chance to take advantage of cheap
labour costs, consolidate its position in the Baltic and place a long-term
bet on Germany pulling off unification.
In his spartan office near the shipyard gates - 'The old management wasn't
close enough to the workforce,' he says, apparently without irony - Soberg
spent two hours last month spelling out his company's plans. In the process,
he is clearly trying to develop management techniques appropriate to a
post-Communist society.
The first step, he says, is to do the 'dirty work'.
In 1993, he intends to cut the labour force by 70 per cent. From a peak of
5,900 workers in 1990, Kvaerner aims to employ 1,900 plus 250 apprentices by
1995. The plan, agreed with Treuhand, the German government-backed
investment agency, and consistent with a union agreement, aims to eliminate
morale-sapping uncertainty.
Kvaerner swept out the former East German management team on the day they
moved in last October - a contrast with the softly-softly approach which the
Norwegians adopted when it purchased the Govan shipyard in Scotland in 1988.
At Govan, Kvaerner left the old management intact, appointing a technical
director. Six months later, they realised their mistake and had to clean
house.
At Warnow, Kvaerner has retained two of the old East German management team,
one in personnel and one in administration. The 'admin' post is critical in
ensuring new executive orders are executed on the old shopfloor. 'Management
has to establish contacts with the workforce rather than floating around in
a fog,' says Soberg.
The next step is to phase in the new technology which is vital to lift
productivity levels. Soberg notes with satisfaction that much of the Warnow
workforce is highly skilled, even by western standards: some 220 are
university-educated engineers, while a further 330 are trained engineers.
Kvaerner has excellent raw material, but the Norwegians are under no
illusion about the time it will take for workers to cope with new
computerised technology. 'If you give your grandmother a new Porsche, she
will drive off the road,' says Soberg.
Once again, there are hints of a different approach to Govan, where a large
amount has been invested since 1988. At Warnow, Soberg is adamant there is
no sense in pouring in at least DM400m (Pounds 166.6m) in new equipment
until the workforce is properly trained. He jokes that sooner or later he
expects his bosses in Norway to ask why little appears to be happening
inside the yard in the first few months.
During a stroll round the 900,000 sq ft shipyard, Soberg points with
satisfaction to workers wearing the yellow Kvaerner hard-hats and operating
western welding technology with unbridled enthusiasm. 'These people have
pride in their job,' he says.
Yet the physical challenge in making Warnow work is daunting. Some 1,700
tonnes of scrap was recovered in the yard in the first few weeks; energy
costs are four times higher than at Govan and most of the equipment has not
been replaced in 40 years. The proportion of administration to production is
more than three-to-one, rather than the western equivalent of one-to-one.
Inefficiency has run riot.
A generous Treuhand aid package provides the cushion for Kvaerner to
restructure, while waiting for the investment in plant to pay off. Kvaerner
 -which ranks in the world's top five companies in terms of capacity - has
received DM900m alone: DM500m to cover expected losses between 1992 and 1996
and a further DM400m to finance modern technology.
Still, the state aid has drawn criticism from the rest of Europe, where
shipbuilding is still suffering from overcapacity. The European Commission
in Brussels is watching closely to check whether the Norwegians fulfil their
commitment to reduce capacity which is the pre-condition for the EC
supporting the state-aid package.
Soberg explains that Warnow is fundamentally changing its business. In
future, ships will be fitted together in separate steel chunks or 'modules'
in dock, rather than in berth - the older, inefficient method of
shipbuilding.
No more building in berth means no more monster cable crane. 'It is a bit of
shame to tear it down,' says Soberg, 'it really ought to be a historical
monument.'

FT  02 APR 93 / Management: The side-effects of a 'cure-all' approach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW management concepts, even including 'excellence' and 'total quality',
have caught on as fast and furiously as 'organisational re-engineering' -
otherwise known by the equally awkward labels of 'core process redesign',
'business re-engineering' and a dozen other permutations of the same six
words, depending on which consultancy you talk to.
But few concepts have been as misunderstood, or risk being as misapplied.
Nor has so much doom been purveyed about the possible employment impact of
any organisational innovation. One forecast last month was that
re-engineering could destroy as many as 25m US jobs, mainly in service
activities.
Contrary to the easily confused, but broader and more complex, concept of
'organisational architecture', the principle behind re-engineering is
straightforward.
Its US consultant-progenitors, Michael Hammer and James Champy, define it as
'the fundamental re-thinking and radical redesign of business processes to
achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of
performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed'.
The word 'radical' means what it says: re-engineering may use similar
analysis methods to the old disciplines of work and time study, or
'industrial engineering', but unlike them it does not cover the
simplification and improvement of existing processes.
Instead, it involves transforming an organisation from one based on separate
'functions' (or specialist departments) - such as product or service design,
engineering, manufacturing, marketing, service and accounting - to one based
on the processes which span most or all of these activities and disciplines.
Most consultants advise organisations to start by re-engineering processes
which take them: from the initial concept for a product or service to its
launch; from customer identification to initial order; from order to
delivery; from service inquiry to fulfilment; and from delivery to payment.
In academic terms, which are being purloined increasingly by the consultants
to help convey their message, re-engineering involves transforming part of a
business unit - and eventually the entire organisation - from its
traditionally 'vertical' structure to a 'horizontal' one.
US companies which have reached various stages down this track, despite the
myriad of political and other internal stumbling blocks, include Texas
Instruments, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Ford, Kodak and Hallmark Cards. Unlikely
partial practitioners in Europe include British Telecom and Lucas.
The reasons why re-engineering has surged to craze-like status over the past
three years are plain but numerous. They include:
Recessionary and other competitive pressures, especially to slash costs, but
also to increase value. If re-engineering promises anything, it is that an
organisation can be re-designed to do 'more with less' - or 'much more with
the same'.
It is the most effective way of making an organisation far faster on its
feet, and more responsive to customers and competitors.
It is the logical next step after 'delayering', 'down-sizing' and
'restructuring' a vertical organisation by conventional means - something
which many large US companies, and a growing number of Europeans, have
accomplished or initiated since the mid-1980s.
It promises an answer to the much-debated problem of stagnant service
productivity. In effect, the re-engineering craze is sweeping into offices a
concept which was tested by cross-functional teams in factories and product
development centres during the 1980s.
It responds to the belated realisation of top managers that fortunes were
wasted on data processing investment in the 1970s and 1980s. Companies
automated old, inefficient functional procedures, instead of first
abandoning many of them, redesigning the resy, and only then computerising.
Hammer shot to general prominence in 1990 with a Harvard Business review
article called 'Don't automate, obliterate'.
It is being driven by sales pressure from every type of consultancy as they
jostle to annex the same territory. The most desperate are those firms which
used to specialise in information technology, such as CSC Index. But
generalists such as McKinsey, which majors on 'core process redesign', are
also in there fighting.
Given the breadth of these influences, it is not surprising that
re-engineering is so widely misunderstood. Like excellence and quality in
the 1980s, it is being touted as both a cure-all and what Hammer calls, in
American franglais, a 'term du jour'. He resents especially the use of it to
embrace delayering and down-sizing. 'Some companies say they've
re-engineered when they've done nothing of the sort - they've simply lopped
off part of the business,' he complains.
In many cases, re-engineering creates no net job losses at all, he says;
instead, its prime objective is to slash 'cycle time' or to raise quality.
But in other instances it can remove between 50 and 75 per cent of the jobs
in a particular process, 'though not in the total organisation'.
At CSC Index, Tom Waite dismisses the 25m US jobs scare as 'beyond the
realms of possibility' if his consultancy's experience with clients is any
guide.
His analysis, and Hammer's, is a partial corrective to the jobs horror story
 -unless one really expects companies to 'go horizontal' from bottom to top,
and to create no extra value or jobs, however indirectly.
There is certainly much talk in US companies of functional bosses
transforming themselves into new 'process owners'. But the realities of
executive life make one sceptical. Re-engineering is a juicy but tough nut
to crack.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Electoral reform reopens opposition
wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS within the Labour party over electoral reform began erupting
yesterday, threatening an internal row that is set to grow through the
summer and foreshadow a fierce debate at the party's autumn conference.
The conclusions of the party's Plant inquiry, which on Wednesday backed by a
narrow majority the supplementary vote method for electing the House of
Commons, provoked a backlash from supporters of the existing
first-past-the-post system.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said: 'To be
able to implement any change it will be necessary to gain power through the
present electoral system. Having done so, it would be madness to then occupy
Parliament with legislation which would make it likely that Labour would
never again form a majority government.'
In contrast, supporters of proportional representation hailed a historic
breakthrough.
'We have got something to build on which I'm very positive about,' said Mr
Jeff Rooker, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr and a member of the Plant
committee which voted by 10 votes to six for the principle of change.
Conservatives were delighted that for once it was not their internal battles
making headlines. Liberal Democrats were not sure whether to woo a party
newly converted to electoral reform or to tease a party taking only the most
tentative of steps forward.
But more pertinent - at least in the short term with talk of election pacts
far away - was the silence from the Labour leadership and most of the shadow
cabinet.
The Plant report has created a dilemma for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
He wants to hold his party together, yet address the pressure within the
movement for modernisation. None of his lieutenants were yesterday prepared
to speculate publicly on possible ways out.
Nor is it clear how Labour's ruling National Executive Committee might vote
when the report is debated at the end of the month.
Most members have been studiously non-committal while the Plant committee
has been deliberating, and will remain mute until the report is published to
coincide with the NEC meeting. 'This thing is completely wide open,' said a
senior party official.
The only certainty is that tensions run to the top of the party. Mrs
Margaret Beckett, deputy leader and Plant committee member, fought valiantly
against any move from first-past-the-post - and will continue her campaign
at the NEC. She may table a minority Plant report.
At the other extreme, Mr Rooker voted against supplementary vote at the
Plant committee's meeting on Wednesday because the system was not truly
proportional.
Pro and anti factions do not fall into neat left-right or
reformist-reactionary categories. Two of Labour's more progressive
frontbenchers, Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, are cautious about
electoral reform. Both will consult with Mr Smith before making public their
views.
What are the options for Mr Smith? He could embrace the report's conclusions
and then try to win first at the NEC, and then at October's party
conference, but confrontations with trade union leaders and Labour members
would be likely.
He could reject the supplementary vote scheme (supported on Plant by only
nine votes to seven) but accept the principle of change. A further
consultation exercise could then follow, but at the cost of yet more
damaging rows.
Or he could reject the principle of change and face a continuing battle with
the reformists. Another option, touted among Labour MPs at Westminster, is
to make reform conditional on a referendum. But a row would still not be
avoided, after the energy the Labour leadership has invested in opposing a
referendum on Maastricht.
Mr Smith knows that yesterday's skirmishes were only the beginning.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh initiative to be extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is extending its so-called Valleys Initiative by a further
five years until 1998.
Announcing the move in the Commons yesterday, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh
secretary, said it would result in more than Pounds 1bn being pumped into
those parts of south Wales worst affected by the departure of heavy
industry.
It was unclear whether any of the promised funds would constitute new money
that would not have been spent if the programme had not been extended.
But Mr Hunt said Mr Bruce Millan, the EC regional policy commissioner, had
agreed to talks about targeting the valleys as a special area for EC
purposes. Any EC funds flowing to the region as a result of such talks would
be additional.
Public funding under the initiative during the five years which ended on
Wednesday totalled about Pounds 770m.
Hailing the 'extensive' achievements of the programme since it was
initiated, Mr Hunt signalled his intention to move away from centrally
managed projects towards schemes driven by local communities.
He said the programme's extension would be marked by 'a distinct change in
style'. He was encouraged by the establishment of a valleys' forum in an
effort to give a 'unified voice' to regional organisations.
Among a string of individual projects, Mr Hunt said that more than Pounds 9m
would be invested over five years in new community hospitals at Ebbw Vale
and Torfaen. Priority would be given to developing improved transport links
between this area and Cardiff Bay. An 'urban village' is to be developed on
the site of the Ebbw Vale national garden festival.
Mr Paul Murphy, Labour Welsh spokesman, said MPs would need to examine the
plans in 'great detail' to see how much new money was involved.
His theme was developed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader and MP
for Islwyn, who said Mr Hunt's statement was in many respects 'a
re-announcement of other re-announcements'.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row erupts over further 5,000 Navy
job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL row erupted at Westminster last night over the disclosure that
the Royal Navy will be cut by 5,000 more personnel than originally planned
in the Options for Change defence review.
Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, said in a written reply that
the further cut of 5,000 would be partly achieved through redundancies of
about 2,300 next yearbut precise numbers and details had yet to be
determined.
'We will be encouraging the maximum number of volunteers, although some
compulsory measures may be needed in order to achieve the proper balance of
manpower within the Royal Navy,' he said.
The Ministry of Defence said last night that the further cuts were now
'unavoidable' as part of a continuing review of numbers beyond the review,
which is due to be completed by the middle of the 1990s.
Opposition politicians reacted angrily to the announcement. Dr David Clark,
the shadow defence secretary, said: 'It is disgraceful that the government
has sneaked out these figures in the fag-end of parliament.
'This form of crisis management actually threatens our defence capability.
What we really need is not a salami-cut approach to defence but a full-scale
defence review so we can see what is needed to defend British interests and
we can make provisions for that.'
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: 'The defence
policies of this government are now in tatters.
'Cuts are being made without rhyme or reason. The only motive is to save
money to meet Treasury targets.'
He called for a full-scale defence review 'before Britain becomes a defence
laughing stock'.
The MoD said Options for Change, announced in 1991, envisaged two or three
phases of redundancy to reduce total numbers from 63,000 to 55,000 by the
mid-1990s.
Mr Hamilton said that the third phase of redundancies had been
'foreshadowed' last year and he was simply confirming it.
The MoD added that the 2,300 redundancies announced last night were needed
because the cut to 50,000 could not be achieved wholly through natural
wastage, reduced recruitment and other measures to control numbers.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: New vote 'would see hung House'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALCULATIONS to be included in the Plant report on electoral reform suggest
that the supplementary vote system would have resulted in a hung parliament
after the April 1992 general election, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, first proposed the
system in 1989. In a later submission to the Plant committee he estimated
that the 1992 results would have left the Tories as the largest party but
with Labour able to form a government with the support of Liberal Democrats
and nationalists.
The number of Liberal Democrat MPs would have been between 44 and 48 -
compared with 20 at present.
Such calculations have to be treated with caution.
Under proportional representation, the behaviour of voters, as well as the
campaign tactics of the political parties, would undoubtedly change.
If a supplementary vote system was adopted, voters would indicate a first
and second preference.
If no candidate secured 50 per cent or more, the first and second placed
candidates then enter a run off with the votes for the eliminated candidates
distributed according to second preferences. Whoever then has the highest
tally wins.
At the last general election, about half of the current number of sitting
MPs won a straight majority of their constituencies' electors.
This is how the system could have affected some of those who did not:
LOSER? Mr John Patten,
Oxford West and Abingdon.
Result, April 1992:
Conservative 25,163
(45.4 per cent of vote)
Liberal Democrat 21,624 (39.0%)
Labour 7,652 (13.8%)
The Labour candidate would have been eliminated and his votes
re-allocated.
If, as would seem likely, enough put Liberal Democrats as second choice,
Mr Patten would have lost his seat.
SAFE? Mr Tristan Garel-Jones,
Watford.
Result, April 1992:
Conservateive 29,072
(48.8 per cent of vote)
Labour 18,482 (32.7%)
Liberal Democrat 10,231 (17.2%)
The Liberal Democrat would have been eliminated and his votes
re-allocated.
But unless almost all second preferences were Labour, Mr Garel-Jones
would probably have been safe.
UNSURE? Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
Edinburgh Pentlands.
Result, April 1992:
Conservative 18,128 (40.7%)
Labour 13,838 (31.3%)
Scottish National 6,882 (15.4%)
Liberal Democrat 5,597 (12.6%)
A four-way split allowed Mr Rifkind to win. Whether he would survive
under supplementary vote would depend on how many Scottish nationalists
and Liberal Democrats put Labour as second choice.
LOSER? Ms Glenda Jackson,
Hampstead and Highgate.
Result, April 1992:
Labour 19,193
(45.1 per cent of vote)
Conservative 17,753 (41.8%)
Liberal Democrat 4,765 (11.2%)
Ms Jackson could have lost to the Conservative candidate if enough
Liberal Democrat voters had indicated that the Tory candidate was their
second preference.

THE GOVERNMENT yesterday turned down Labour demands for a Commons statement
on last month's disclosure that a number of banks had received financial
support from the Bank of England in the second half of 1991, and that some

Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister, replied to a string of

it was for the Bank to determine its policy on answering questions

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to answer on party funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE party officials will appear to answer questions from MPs
investigating the funding of political parties, Mr John Major said
yesterday.
The cross-party home affairs committee announced its inquiry into the
question of state aid for political parties earlier this week.
The prime minister had been pressed on the point by Mr George Mudie, a
Labour MP, who said he hoped the Tories would co-operate fully with the
inquiry, including the disclosure of 'such items as the Pounds 17m secretly
paid to the Conservatives to cover the cost of the last general election'.
Mr Major's promise of co-operation will be welcomed by the committee, which
has no power to force MPs or peers to attend.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists angry at Reynolds'
remarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONISTS MPs last night attacked Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, over Ireland's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland and over
counter-terrorism efforts - reducing still further the chances of political
talks resuming soon, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Reynolds said the Irish government employed 'all means' at its disposal
to combat terrorism.
But Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader said: 'The Irish government
has the same ultimate objectives as the IRA, a united, republican Ireland.
It is simply that the Irish government want to achieve it by peaceful means,
and the IRA otherwise.'
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has tried to reassure Unionists that
Ireland's constitutional claim could be re-negotiated as part of a wider
political settlement. But political talks are not expected to resume before
May's local elections in Northern Ireland.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour steps up attack on VAT plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders last night stepped up their attack on the imposition of
valued added tax on domestic fuel following confirmation in the Commons that
it will also apply to gas and electricity standing charges.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, incensed Labour MPs by rejecting their
claims that it had not previously been made clear that standing charges
would be subject to VAT from April of next year.
He insisted that for standing charges to be exempt would open up an obvious
route for avoiding the tax.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, seized on the standing charges issue
to renew demands that pensioners and others on low incomes should be fully
compensated for the increase in domestic fuel bills due to the imposition of
VAT.
He wrote to the chancellor asking him to confirm that levying VAT on
standing charges would impose an additional burden of Pounds 14 on
pensioners and others on low incomes.
Mr Brown is orchestrating a new publicity campaign aimed at embarrassing
Tory MPs by highlighting their personal election pledges not to increase the
tax burden.
Labour MPs hope this will result in Tory backbenchers coming under
increasing pressure on the extension of VAT to domestic fuel while they are
in their constituencies during the Easter recess.
The government encountered little resistance from Tory critics of the VAT
imposition when it was challenged from the opposition benches during the
Budget debate, but Labour strategists believe ministers could face greater
difficulties when the specific provisions are put to the vote.
During question time Mr Lamont reaffirmed that the normal timetable for
uprating social security benefits would ensure that extra help was available
from April of next year - 'the precise moment that extra bills arrive'.
He stressed: 'While we regard this measure as necessary on both fiscal and
environmental grounds it is not our intention that poor people should
suffer.'
Poor families spend only marginally less on domestic fuel than those on
average income, the government admitted yesterday.
In response to a written question by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security
secretary, Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister, said households on
50 per cent of average income spend Pounds 11.50 a week on domestic fuel,
compared with Pounds 12.10 spent by households on average income.
Poor households spend more on electricity than their counterparts on average
income and four times as much on coal and coke.

FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major backs claim on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister yesterday supported an appeal for interim payments to be
made from the remaining funds of occupational pension schemes plundered by
Robert Maxwell.
Mr Richard Page (C Hertfordshire South-West) said that the trustees of the
Maxwell pension funds would be meeting later this month to discuss the
common investment fund which stood at about Pounds 180m.
He asked Mr Major to contact the trustees and urge a partial distribution so
that pensioners could have payments while the 'missing millions' were found
and a long term solution put in place.

FT  02 APR 93 / Only three council budgets capped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, the environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that just
three English councils are to have their budgets limited, or capped, by the
government this year.
The only county council to be capped is Gloucestershire, in which no party
has overall control.
The two district councils to be capped are Castle Point (Tory) and Harlow
(Labour), both in Essex.
At just less than Pounds 18m, Harlow's budget was more than twice what the
government thought it should be.
The small number of councils to be capped - less than half the number of
recent years - is a sign of the government's increasingly tight controls on
local spending.

FT  02 APR 93 / Official fears on bus deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Transport has acknowledged that the deregulation of bus
services outside London in the late 1980s may have had harmful as well as
beneficial effects.
It has circulated a consultation paper in the bus industry which lists
widespread concerns about the way deregulation has worked and seeks
suggestions for improvements.
The consultation paper comes at a sensitive time because the government is
bound by a manifesto promise to deregulate bus services in London within the
lifetime of the current parliament.
Bus operators in the rest of the country have been competing with one
another since the passing of the 1985 Transport Act.
The paper says deregulation outside London has caused a cut in bus operating
costs, a reduction in local authority subsidies and an increase in
innovation.
It concedes, however, that a number of concerns have arisen.
For example:
Timetables change so frequently that passengers find it difficult to obtain
up-to-date information.
The short period of notice required for changes in services causes
instability and discourages potential users.
The bunching of services by competing operators on busy routes is causing
congestion in city centres.
There is no right of appeal for companies excluded from travelcard schemes
run by other operators.
The Department of Transport says that any changes to the present
arrangements will need to be judged by the benefits and costs to passengers,
operators and local authorities.
It wants comments by June 30.

FT  02 APR 93 / Lord Zuckerman: Scientist with political influence -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Zuckerman OM, who died yesterday aged 88, was scientific adviser to the
government from 1964 to 1971. Few scientists have gained access to the
corridors of power as successfully as the South African-born zoologist who
began to establish an international scientific reputation at the age of 27.
No scientist in modern times retained political influence for so long. Until
late in his life an office and secretary in the Cabinet Office were reserved
for his use.
For more than 50 years Solly Zuckerman continued to tell people unpalatable
truths, sometimes with charm but often with impatience. In the early 1970s
he produced a report which stated that cancer research lacked enough fresh
ideas to warrant any 'crash' programme at the taxpayer's expense. He also
accepted a brief from the UK mining industry to 'make recommendations
designed to reconcile economic and technical considerations with other
requirements of national policy'. To the chagrin of conservationist
interests, he refused to condemn outright the investigation of national
parks and areas of great natural beauty for potential mineral wealth. He
believed the public should be allowed to weigh the relative benefits.
Zuckerman was born in Cape Town in 1904. He left South Africa when he was
21. During his schooldays he was interested in evolution, yet he came to
Britain to study medicine at University College Medical School in London.
There he met Professor Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, one of the most influential
anatomists of his day, from whom the young Zuckerman learned to crusade for
his own opinions.
Anthropological interests form a thread that ran through Zuckerman's career.
He was 27 when he published his Social Life of Monkeys and Apes. In the
1970s, as secretary of the Zoological Society of London, which runs the
capital's zoon, he enjoyed a second London office in Regent's Park within
earshot of his beloved apes.
His research at Birmingham, where he was Sands Cox Professor of Anatomy for
25 years, led him naturally into government science at the start of the
second world war. With the late J. D. Bernal, Zuckerman began to strip some
of the mythology from the accepted view of the effects of bombs. His
experiments showed that the wounding effects of fragmentation were much less
of a hazard than was supposed. The real hazard was falling buildings.
'Don't let's fool ourselves' was one of Zuckerman's favourite phrases.
Usually it presaged some unpalatable truth. 'An arrogant man, but one of
great humility in the face of facts' is how one colleague recalls him from
his halcyon days of the 1960s when, for 18 months, he served both as chief
scientific adviser to the government and as chief scientific adviser to the
Ministry of Defence. He was notoriously impatient with civil servants who
would not accept facts.
He never shirked big issues. One of them concerned tactical nuclear weapons.
By the 1960s an immensely expensive weapons research effort had provided
Nato with nuclear versions of almost every kind of ordnance.
The man who 20 years before began telling the mandarins they were
overestimating the effects of high explosive bombs, told them they were
underestimating the consequences of nuclear battle. No sane person could
contemplate a battle in which each explosion would be able to devastate an
entire town.
But for one powerful ally, Zuckerman's nuclear advice might have gone
unheeded. A friendship dating from the second world war with Lord
Mountbatten, by then admiral of the fleet and chief of the defence staff,
proved an alliance too strong for those who favoured tactical nuclear
weapons. A strategy founded on the Polaris missile and its elusive submarine
launchpad was to replace plans for nuclear shells.
He fought a more public battle in 1967, in defence of Cornish beaches, when
the Torry Canyon with 550,000 litres of crude oil aboard struck a rock in
the English Channel. As the Labour government's chief scientific adviser, he
recommended that the broken vessel be bombed with napalm to try to destroy
the oil, revealing to many that Britain had stocks of the agent.
As chief scientific adviser, Zuckerman helped create Britain's Department of
the Environment in 1970. He was an early advocate of the policy that the
only practical form of control over pollution was to make the polluter pay.
He was made a life peer on his official retirement in 1971.

FT  02 APR 93 / South will gain from business rates shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BURDEN of business rates is set to shift away from the south-east
towards the Midlands and the north following the 1995 rating revaluation,
which will be based on rental values at the start of this month.
The rates bills of offices in the City of London could more than halve while
those in the west Midlands could rise by 58 per cent, according to Gerald
Eve, chartered surveyors. Overall, the rates bills of office users may fall
by an average of 19 per cent.
Retailers are likely to see an overall average increase of 6 per cent,
ranging from a decline in central London of about 15 per cent to an increase
of 20 per cent in the Midlands and the north.
Industrial occupiers may be faced with an increased rates bill of 16 per
cent, ranging from a 7 per cent increase in the south-east to a 32 per cent
increase in the west Midlands.
The revaluation could save the occupier of a 100,000 sq ft City office block
about Pounds 1m a year, while the rates payable on a 100,000 sq ft Leeds
factory might rise by about Pounds 30,000.
These large variations reflect the disparate performances of different
regions and different sectors of the property market.
While central London office rents were approaching their peak in April 1988,
much of the country experienced steep rent increases that year and the next.
The shift in the rates burden is much smaller than in the last revaluation
of 1990, the first for 17 years, which was based on rental values in 1988.
That redistributed the cost of rates from the north to the south and from
factories and warehouses towards office and retail property.
In England and Wales the uniform business rate raised about Pounds 13.7bn in
the 12 months to this April. The Inland Revenue's valuation office bases its
rates assessments on information provided by occupiers about their buildings
and leases.
It will shortly be despatching forms requesting information to occupiers.
The average increase in rateable value in 1995 will be 30 per cent,
according to Gerald Eve.

FT  02 APR 93 / English Estates in Pounds 40m sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH ESTATES, the government's industrial and commercial property
developer, yesterday announced the biggest sale yet in its programme of
disposals to the private sector.
In a Pounds 40m deal, to be completed by the end of this week, it is selling
95 modern estates of small factories and workshops in various parts of the
north of England to the Lancashire-based Northern Trust Company.
Mr Bill Locke, estate management director of English Estates, admitted
yesterday that the complexity of offering for sale a portfolio of 1,700
multi-tenanted freehold and leasehold units, totalling 3.1m sq ft, had
aroused some scepticism in the property industry.
'It's a sale the market has been looking at with interest,' he said. 'It's
been a bit of a legal nightmare.'
The portfolio was first marketed last autumn but all offers received were
rejected as too low. Mr Locke said lower interest rates had meant a change
in market conditions, resulting in new offers. Northern Trust said it
believed prices had neared the bottom of the market.
The buildings, 84 per cent of which are let, generate annual income of just
more than Pounds 6m, giving an initial return on the Pounds 40m purchase
price of about 13.5 per cent.
The deal brings to Pounds 180m the sum English Estates has raised by
property sales in the two years since the government ordered it to sell its
assets to generate income.
The Pounds 40m will be used to fund new developments. The National Audit
Office, the public expenditure watchdog, is preparing a study on the
disposals programme for publication this summer.
The sale to Northern Trust, a privately owned company with investment,
property and leisure interests, leaves English Estates with 5,000 units.

A FRIDAY rail strike will be a good excuse for workers in many parts of the
UK to extend the weekend or arrange to work at home. For those who must get
into work or who enjoy overcoming commuting adversities, here is a guide to
what's on and where.
Rail: British Rail is advising passengers not to try to go anywhere by train
today. The odd train may be running - listen to local radio - but there is
no guarantee that if you reach work by train you will be able to get back
home again, said BR.
Non-BR services, for example the Tyne and Wear metro, the Greater Manchester
metrolink supertram, the Glasgow Underground and the Docklands light railway
should be operating normally.
London Tube: There were rumours yesterday of unofficial action by Tube
workers but London Underground said it planned to operate a near-complete
service.
Assurances had been received by the RMT rail union that none of its Tube
members would be striking but there could be a 'few extremists', said
management.
The only parts of the Tube likely to be shut today are those that have
tracks and signals run by BR. Probably hit will be the Bakerloo line north
of Queen's Park, Turnham Green to Richmond on the District line, and Putney
Bridge to Wimbledon, also on the District line.
London buses: A day of industrial action today, the third in a series, will
mean about two-thirds of red buses in the capital are likely to be off the
road. Buses operated by private contractors should run normally.
London parking: Commuters will be able to use an emergency car park at
Greenland Pier, Surrey Docks, and then use the Riverbus. There will also be
extra parking at Masthouse Terrace, off West Ferry Road in Docklands, which
is near Island Gardens station on the Docklands light railway. London
parking inquiries: 071 276 0800.
Coaches: National Express, which runs services throughout the UK, is
guaranteeing to take anyone who buys a ticket early in the day. It usually
has about 600 coaches on the road and will probably increase this to about
1,000. National Express: 021 626 6226.
Roads: Main problem areas are likely to be heading into Glasgow and the
Forth and Tay road bridges, the main routes into Bristol and Exeter and all
routes into London. Extra ferries will be running across the Mersey.
Automobile Association hotline: 0336 401 700.
Air: British Airways said shuttle services would be increased. Passengers
needing to get to London Stansted airport will be able to catch a
half-hourly coach service from Walthamstow Central station on the Victoria
line. Extra coaches from Victoria will serve Gatwick airport. Beware taxi
touts.

FT  02 APR 93 / London action is latest in series: As commuters across

<TEXT>
TODAY'S 24-hour bus strike is the latest in a series of stoppages prompted
by government moves to privatise London Buses.
Unions say the action has been triggered by management cost cuts following
the government's decision to change the system of grants paid to London
Buses ahead of next year's privatisation and deregulation.
The 11 subsidiaries of London Buses share a government block grant of about
Pounds 120m a year. From yesterday all routes that receive a grant were put
on minimum subsidy contracts, under which bus operators estimate cash fares
and the proportion of 'off-bus income' and then bid for a minimum subsidy to
cover the gap.
London Buses, anxious not to lose more routes to independent operators, has
hinted to its subsidiaries that it does not want to agree contracts at costs
significantly higher than those of private companies.
Of London's 28 operators, 17 are in private hands and all expect to run
services today in spite of the stoppage.
London Buses' subsidiaries, aware of the growing private sector competition,
have told their employees that changes in terms and conditions are essential
to avoid job losses.
The 12,800 employees at the subsidiaries have been asked to sign new
employment contracts agreeing to changes in conditions involving cuts of
Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 a week on basic gross pay. In addition, staff were
asked to work between three and five extra hours a week. Those not complying
with the new contracts would be sacked.
Managers have also warned that pensions would be frozen with privatisation
and it would be up to individual operators to make new arrangements.
The TGWU general union initially recommended that staff should not sign the
new contracts. Mr Ken Fuller, TGWU district officer for buses, said staff
started to sign them because they feared losing their jobs. The union then
recommended that if members accepted the contracts they should attach a
disclaimer saying they wanted to keep their jobs but on terms negotiated by
their union.
Ninety-nine per cent of bus drivers have accepted the new contracts. On
February 19 a ballot resulted in two thirds agreeing to industrial action.
Mr Fuller said: 'People signed the acceptance forms to protect themselves as
individuals but they have taken a collective decision to resist them.'

<TEXT>
DRIVERS at a north London bus depot yesterday accused managers of blackmail
as they prepared for a one-day strike over new working conditions.
Although many of the drivers at the Holloway depot have accepted new
employment contracts from London Buses, they said there was no contradiction
in taking strike action over the terms.
'It was legalised blackmail the way they forced us as individuals to accept
these new contracts,' said Mr Clive Reid, who has driven buses in London for
26 years.
'It was a case of you could keep your job if you accepted the new contract
and if you do not you are out. We accepted the contracts as individuals but
this is collective action to try and persuade the management to come to the
table and renegotiate the contracts.'
During the two 24-hour bus stoppages last month all but one of the depot's
374 staff withdrew their labour. There has been equally strong backing for
the latest strike call.
The one man who crossed the picket line, and who is expected to work today,
has not accepted the new contract and is on notice of dismissal. 'He is like
that,' said Mr Vic Hawkins, a colleague.

FT  02 APR 93 / Strikes pose little threat to economy: As commuters across
Britain face widespread disruption, FT writers assess the strategies of the
unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY years ago a one-day strike by the main rail and mining unions,
boasting a combined membership of about 500,000, would have sent shudders
through the economy.
Today the combined membership is closer to 100,000 and, aside from the
considerable inconvenience to rail commuters, the one-day strikes will have
little economic significance.
Less than 10 per cent of domestic freight is now carried by rail and the
coal stockpile is 11m tonnes, more than a quarter of the coming year's
contract with the electricity generators.
The unions, aware of the limited impact of their action, cite the official
reason for today's disruption as the European Trade Union Confederation's
day of action against unemployment.
Unofficially, however, today is the closest that the more traditional
sections of the British labour movement can get to a general strike against
unemployment and pit closures.
Leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers still believe pit closures and
privatisation can be stopped by mass action supported by sympathetic public
opinion.
Mr Ken Capstick, leader of the Yorkshire NUM, says: 'We don't have the
industrial muscle any longer and we rely on popular support and on other
sections of the trade union movement. But in a strange sort of way the
miners can still give the lead.'
The RMT rail union appears to accept that privatisation is unstoppable but
wants to cushion members from the effects.
Its low-key campaign has failed to win the public support that it achieved
during the 1989 rail dispute but it has forced the government into
abandoning plans for a radical restructuring of the British Rail pension
fund.
The official reasons for action today are that BR is refusing to give a 'no
compulsory redundancy agreement' and refusing to abandon the use of private
contractors on traditional railway work. But the RMT executive also wants to
show solidarity with the NUM, especially because many of the 20,000 job cuts
expected at BR are linked to pit closures.
Laws on industrial action, however, mean the RMT may only take action
against its own management.
The NUM won 60 per cent support on a 75 per cent turnout for the action and
the RMT got 70 per cent support on a 55 per cent turnout. Both have talked
about further action but no firm decisions have been taken.
The RMT, in particular, might face a much tougher reaction from BR and even
from the government if it does attempt another strike.
Whatever the outcome of today's action and the threat of further disruption,
the important future battles will be fought in the law courts.

FT  02 APR 93 / Strikes of no economic significance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY years ago a one-day strike by the main rail and mining unions,
boasting a combined membership of about half a million, would have sent
shudders through the economy.
Today the combined membership is closer to 100,000 and, aside from the
considerable inconvenience to rail commuters, the one-day strikes will have
no economic significance.
Less than 10 per cent of domestic freight is now carried by rail, and the
coal stockpile is currently 11m tonnes, more than a quarter of the coming
year's contract with the electricity generators.
Aware of the limited impact of their action, the unions cite the official
reason for today's disruption as the European Trade Union Confederation's
day of action against unemployment.
Unofficially, however, today is the closest that the more traditional
sections of the British labour movement can get to a 'general strike'
against unemployment and pit closures.
Leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers still believe pit closures and
privatisation can be stopped by mass action supported by sympathetic public
opinion.
Mr Ken Capstick, leader of the Yorkshire NUM, says: 'We don't have the
industrial muscle any longer and we rely on popular support and on other
sections of the trade union movement. But in a strange sort of way the
miners can still give the lead.'
The rail union, RMT, meanwhile, appears to accept that rail privatisation is
unstoppable but wants to cushion its members from the effects.
Its low key campaign has failed to win the public support that it achieved
during the 1989 dispute but it has forced the government into abandoning
plans for a radical restructuring of the British Rail pension fund. The
official reasons for action today are that BR is refusing to give a 'no
compulsory redundancy agreement' and refusing to abandon the use of private
contractors on traditional railway work.
But the RMT executive also wants to show solidarity with the NUM, especially
because many of the 20,000 job cuts expected at BR are linked to pit
closures.
Laws on industrial action, however, mean RMT may only take action against
its own management.
Neither union has won overwhelming support from its members for even one day
of action.
The NUM won 60 per cent support on a 75 per cent turn-out and the RMT got 70
per cent support on a 55 per cent turn-out. Both have talked about further
action but no firm decisions have been taken. RMT, in particular, might face
a much tougher reaction from BR and even from the government if it attempts
another strike.
Whatever the outcome of today's action and the threat of further disruption,
the important future battles will be fought in the law courts.
The key issue in the mines will be what happens to the Mines and Quarries
Act, one of the most rigorous pieces of health and safety legislation in
Britain.
If the NUM can keep the essentials of that act they will help retain union
power at pit level and make privatisation less attractive. The RMT,
meanwhile, will probably be covered by the European Transfer of Undertakings
legislation - protecting jobs and pay levels - when franchisees take over
the rail service.
In neither industry will the unions be completely marginalised, even after
privatisation, but the sort of labour flexibility now common in
manufacturing industry will increasingly become the norm.

FT  02 APR 93 / Government will cap three councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that just
three English councils are to have their budgets limited, or capped, by the
government this year.
The only county to be capped is Gloucestershire, in which no party has
overall control. The two districts to be capped are Castle Point (Tory) and
Harlow (Labour), both in Essex.
At just less than Pounds 18m, Harlow's budget was more than twice what the
government thought it should be.
The small number of councils to be capped - less than half the number of
recent years - is a sign of the government's increasingly tight controls on
local spending.
Separately, Mr John Major yesterday used prime minister's questions to drive
home the claim that Conservative councils set lower council taxes. The claim
is the basis of the Conservative campaign for the county elections on May 6.
The councils have 28 days to challenge the government's decision. The new
limits would cut the council tax on a two-person household in a band D home
(worth between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000) by Pounds 288 in Harlow,
Pounds 55 in Gloucestershire and Pounds 18 in Castle Point.

FT  02 APR 93 / Wellcome's AZT sales threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than a third of Wellcome's AZT sales could be at risk if the
preliminary conclusions of the Concorde trials published today are accepted
by the medical community.
The trials, the results of which are contested by Wellcome, suggest AZT does
not improve mortality in HIV-positive patients who have not yet shown
Aids-related symptoms. The trials do not challenge the effectiveness of AZT
in treating patients with Aids and Aids-related complex.
AZT's worldwide sales were Pounds 213m in 1991-92, representing 12.5 per
cent of Wellcome's sales. For the first six months to February this year
they were Pounds 131m out of a group turnover of Pounds 1.025bn.
Analysts had expected AZT sales to increase because of the growing number of
Aids patients, and also because of Wellcome's ability to convince more
asymptomatic HIV-positive patients to take the drug, also known as Retrovir.
Today's report is likely to undermine such forecasts, particularly in the
UK, where analysts have been more bullish about the company's prospects.
Wellcome estimates that 38 per cent of patients in the US taking AZT are
asymptomatic. The remainder have Aids or Aids-related complex. There are
between 125,000 and 150,000 US patients on the drug.
The potential asymptomatic market, if AZT had proved effective, was huge.
Wellcome estimated last year there were up to 600,000 asymptomatic patients
in the US alone. Analysts estimate there are about 1.5m people infected by
HIV in the developed world.
Wellcome has had considerable difficulty convincing asymptomatic patients to
take the drug because of side-effects, in particular anaemia, and lack of
clear data about the drug's efficacy in such patients.
Dr Jonathan Gelles, the pharmaceutical analyst with Wertheim Schroder in New
York, questioned the potential damage of the Concorde study.
He said: 'We came to the conclusion some time ago that the drug will be
restricted to those who have the disease. The current share price discounts
10 pieces of bad news.'
Wellcome shares have tumbled by about Pounds 1.50 to 760p since last week
when the company announced healthy results but signalled that margins were
being squeezed. However, because of the tight security surrounding today's
Lancet article, the share price was relatively stable, slipping only 19p to
743p.

FT  02 APR 93 / M0 growth expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOTAL of UK bank notes in circulation grew at an accelerating pace last
month, suggesting continuing expansion of retail turnover and adding to
signs that Britain is moving out of recession, Peter Norman writes.
The Bank of England reported yesterday that the value of notes in
circulation rose by 5.3 per cent in the week to March 31 compared with the
equivalent week a year ago.
City analysts said the latest weekly increase suggested that M0, the narrow
measure of money supply comprising mainly notes and coins in circulation,
grew by about 5 per cent in the year to March compared with 4.5 per cent in
the year to February. The Bank will release provisional M0 figures for March
on Monday.
M0 is therefore likely to be growing well above the 0 to 4 per cent
monitoring range announced by the chancellor in the Budget last month.

FT  02 APR 93 / Trials make grim news for sufferers: Shortcomings of Aids
drug revealed despite millions of pounds spent on research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the 10m or so people worldwide infected with HIV but not yet showing
symptoms of Aids, the failure of the Concorde trial to demonstrate any
clinical benefit from early treatment with AZT is grim news.
No other drug available today can delay the onset of symptoms and the
immediate outlook is not encouraging, even though the international
pharmaceutical industry and government laboratories are spending more than
Pounds 1bn a year on Aids research.
AZT itself reached the market in March 1987, a record 2 1/2 years after
Wellcome researchers discovered its activity against HIV, the virus that
causes Aids. But no more anti-HIV drugs were licensed until last year when
DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US and DDC from Roche of Switzerland
were launched.
AZT, DDI and DDC are chemically similar drugs, called nucleoside analogues.
They all work by mimicking one of the natural building blocks of genetic
material. When HIV takes up one of the synthetic molecules, this jams the
mechanism by which the drug replicates.
The drugs slow down the rate at which HIV infects a patient's immune system
but they cannot eliminate the virus, let alone cure Aids. Their drawbacks
include toxic side-effects (bone marrow suppression in AZT's case) and the
development of viral resistance to the drugs.
Clinical trials have shown that DDI and DDC, like AZT, can prolong the life
of Aids patients whose immune defences are already collapsing. But there is
no evidence that they would be any better than AZT in staving off symptoms
in those who are in the early stages of infec-tion.
In the US, four smaller trials of AZT in early HIV infection have given more
encouraging results. Like Concorde, they compared groups of people who had
been allocated at random to take either AZT or a placebo (inactive pills).
All four trials showed that the drug delayed the onset of Aids and three
were stopped early on ethical grounds - with patients followed up for no
more than a year on average - so that those on placebo could receive the
supposed benefits of AZT.
When the US results came in, the Anglo-French committee co-ordinating
Concorde decided to stick to their planned three-year trial. They did,
however, change the procedure so that patients with persistently low levels
of CD4 immune cells - normally a sign that symptoms are about to develop -
could opt to take AZT. CD4 cells are white blood cells which play a key role
in the immune system.
Wellcome said yesterday that, by changing the design in this way and
allowing patients to move from placebo to AZT, the researchers 'diluted' the
difference between the two groups. But Professor Ian Waller, Concorde's
principal UK investigator, denied that the trial's impact had been reduced
significantly.
'This is much the most powerful study ever carried out with asymptomatic
patients,' he said. In terms of the number patient-years studied, Concorde
was larger than the four US trials put together.
After Concorde, Prof Waller and his colleagues see little future in treating
people with HIV with a single drug.
They hope that combinations of three or more drugs - which might include
AZT, DDI or DDC with others still being developed - will prove to be more
successful at stopping HIV. But that prospect lies several years in the
future.

FT  02 APR 93 / ScotRail's franchising criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been accused of structuring the franchising of ScotRail,
British Rail's Scottish division, in a way that favours larger bidders or a
buy-out by its management at the expense of smaller companies.
The Department of Transport plans to seek tenders next year from
private-sector companies and buy-out teams. British Bus, a Salisbury-based
group which runs buses in parts of Surrey, the Midlands, north-west England
and Wales, says offering ScotRail as a single unit makes it impossible for
many potential operators to bid for the franchise.
ScotRail has annual fares income of more than Pounds 80m before subsidies.
It operates 2,180 miles of track, of which 1,440 are passenger route miles.
Mr Kenneth Irvine, rail privatisation project manager at British Bus -
formerly Drawlane Transport - said the task of carrying out an audit of an
operation of that size was too big for most bus com-panies.
'The decision to keep ScotRail as one unit reduces competition and will
lower the price the franchise is likely to fetch,' he said.
Mr Irvine added that the system favoured larger companies such as
Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator whose Stock Exchange flotation this
month is expected to value it at more than Pounds 120m. Stagecoach has said
it is interested in the Scotrail franchise.
Mr Irvine said the government's decision would also favour a buy-out by
ScotRail's existing management. Mr Cyril Bleasdale, ScotRail's director, has
said staff would probably want to bid.
Mr Irvine said ScotRail should be split up into somewhere from two to five
parts. Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central stations could become the
centres of two units.
The transport department said ministers were firm in their decision to
franchise ScotRail as one unit. It added that in later years franchisees
might lose their exclusivity, opening the way to other operators on parts of
the network.
Observers feel that franchising ScotRail to a buy-out or to Stagecoach would
appeal to Scottish national feeling and have more chance of acceptance in a
country normally hostile to privatisation.

FT  02 APR 93 / Minford expects fall in jobless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT is set to fall sharply without the risk of inflation being
reignited, says Professor Patrick Minford of the University of Liverpool.
In a paper, co-authored with Mr Jonathon Riley of the Cardiff Business
School, he says that micro problems in the labour market have been
substantially diminished by the supply side reforms of the 1980s.
Prof Minford takes issue with the argument that the lack of pressure from
'outsiders' - most typically the long-term unemployed - helps to push up
wages for those in work. He says that 50 per cent of the labour force may
have quit jobs and experienced a spell of unemployment in the past four
years.

THE PRIME minister yesterday supported an appeal for interim payments to be

Mr Richard Page, Conservative MP for Hertfordshire South-West, said that the
trustees of the Maxwell pension funds would be meeting later this month to

He asked Mr Major to contact the trustees and urge a partial distribution so
that pensioners could have payments while the 'missing millions' were found
and a long-term solution put in place.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES rose by 1 per cent in March according to Nationwide, the second
largest building society, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
The rise follows a fall of 1.4 per cent in February and a 1.2 per cent rise
in January but Nationwide expects further price rises following the Budget's
increased stamp duty threshold of Pounds 60,000. The society hopes this will
help lure first-time buyers.
Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said: 'Transaction levels have begun to
move ahead and recovery is likely to continue as the normal springtime
increase in activity comes through. The current low level of mortgage rates
and the particularly competitive fixed-rate deals on offer appear to be
attracting more people back into the market.'
The average house price in the UK was Pounds 52,311 last month, according to
Nationwide. House prices were 5.2 per cent down in the year to March.

FT  02 APR 93 / Gas-fired power station unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENRON, one of the largest gas companies in the US, yesterday unveiled its
Pounds 850m showpiece gas-fired power station at Teesside.
The company has a 50 per cent stake in the 1,875MW plant which is the
largest combined heat and power station in the world.
The glittering high-tech plant is a powerful symbol of the electricity
industry's 'dash-for-gas', the rush to replace coal-fired power with gas.
Its four equity partners - Midlands, Northern, South Western and South Wales
regional electricity companies - have agreed to buy most of the power to
supply their domestic customers.
'Projects like these help us and the other regional electricity companies to
keep prices in check,' said Mr David Jones, chief executive of South Wales
Electricity, who is also chairman of Teesside Power, the company that will
run the power plant.
Imperial Chemical Industries has also agreed to buy 257MW of the
electricity. In addition, waste gases from the combined cycle gas turbine
plant will provide all the steam required by ICI's nearby Wilton facility.
The fully computerised power station employs just 65 people compared with
650 workers at a similar coal-fired plant. It covers 23 acres - just a
fraction of the 800 acres occupied by a coal plant with the same power
output.
Mr Jones said that Teesside would save 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions
a year - it emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant. The plant's
sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous
oxide waste.

FT  02 APR 93 / Check urged on low audit fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS who undercut their competitors' prices will have to prove that they
have complied with professional standards under new draft ethical rules.
Those indulging in 'predatory pricing' or 'lowballing' - quoting fees
substantially lower than those of other firms - must ensure that the client
has a full description of the services to be covered and the basis on which
the fee will be determined for current and future years.
The details come in draft guidelines from the chartered accountants' joint
ethics committee, which covers the professional bodies in the UK and
Ireland.
A consultation process started last summer after concern about a number of
high-profile cases in which auditors had won tenders at substantially lower
rates than the existing audit fee.
These included Price Waterhouse's successful bid for the Prudential audit,
which appeared to reduce the audit fee by more than Pounds 900,000, although
it later emerged that three other large audit firms had tendered similar
bids.
The joint ethics committee stopped short of introducing restrictions on the
levels of audit fees charged. 'We decided not to muck about with the
market,' said Mr Jock Worsley, its chairman.
The consultation prior to the draft paper showed little evidence that
undercutting led to lower standards, nor that reduced fees discouraged firms
from conducting research and technical development.
It did highlight the fact that low fee quotations might result from more
efficient use of staff or other management actions.

FT  02 APR 93 / Seeboard to cut hundreds of jobs in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL HUNDRED jobs are expected to go at Seeboard, distributor and
supplier of electricity in the south-east of England, following a
restructuring of the company to be announced today or next week.
Although the job losses are likely to be phased over more than a year, they
come after an 18-month period in which more than 400 jobs have been shed
from the previous workforce of 6,000.
The restructuring involves a rationalisation of operating divisions,
contracting out of information technology services to an outside company and
a move to smaller headquarters.
Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, was unavailable for comment yesterday but he
presaged the changes when announcing the company's interim results in
January by saying he planned to move to different headquarters and
investigate the possibility of introducing 'business streams'.
It is thought the five main operating divisions will be reduced to three,
each of them run as a separate profit-making business. The corporate
reporting structure will be simplified.
Analysts speculated that the three likely divisions would be based around
distribution, supply and the rest of the business - which includes retailing
and contracting.
The new headquarters will be in the Crawley area in West Sussex. Eventually
only about 100 people will be employed there, as against a current total of
500 at the headquarters in Hove, East Sussex. The move will be delayed until
completion of the building next year.
Although the company expects that most of the cuts will be met by voluntary
redundancies, it has not ruled out forced redundancies.

FT  02 APR 93 / Paper profits that might be write-offs: The new proposals
that could radically alter company acquisition accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES were yesterday digesting proposals from the Accounting Standards
Board on acquisition accounting which would, if implemented, wipe many
millions of pounds off the reported profits of British companies.
The controversial proposals are in a 72-page document - Fair Values in
Acquisition Accounting. Those most affected would be conglomerates which
make their business by acquiring companies.
'If I fall under a bus, I want a full police investigation,' Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, joked this week after
launching the proposals.
In the 1980s, the financial treatment of acquisitions became what Mr Tweedie
calls the black hole of British accounting. 'If I could put one thing right
with accounts, this would be it,' he says.
Companies would set up what he calls 'big bath' provisions on the
acquisition of a business, ostensibly to cover the restructuring costs and
the write-down of assets over-valued by the previous management.
These costs and write-downs were never passed through the profit and loss
account, and the provision created could be released in later years with the
effect of inflating profits.
For example Mr Terry Smith, a City analyst, highlights that Coloroll in its
accounts for the year to March 31 1989 utilised Pounds 52m of provisions,
with pre-tax profits of just Pounds 56m - nearly all reported profit came
from the provisions, not operations.
One likely objection from companies - anticipated in the board's discussion
document - is prudence. Provisions appear to be conservative, since the
company appears to be carefully allowing for future losses.
Mr Tweedie argues this is not prudent for the profit and loss account.
'There is always a mulch over the accounts. It is unclear what is
happening.'
There has been a muted response to the proposals. Publicly companies tend to
say they would not object to change as long as their competitors are obliged
to follow suit.
Acquisition accounting has long been loathed by companies which were targets
of corporate predators, because it showed the acquirers' performance in a
better light than their own results.
But Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive of Williams Holdings, the
conglomerate, says: 'It is absolutely right that these things should be
disclosed. The facts should be there for all shareholders to see. But they
already are. Putting our costs through the profit and loss account will just
confuse readers.'
The philosophical basis for the board's proposals is a stark and simple
phrase in its statement of principles, the theoretical framework which
helped direct discussion as the draft was being prepared.
The phrase defines liabilities as the requirement of a company to pay out.
Most acquisition provisions - such as those for reorganisation or the
closure of duplicate facilities - do not meet these requirements.
Even when some of those still do - including some write-downs of assets -
the board's proposals say companies must disclose any material contributions
that they make to reported operating profits.
That will reduce the scope for companies to make excessive write-downs which
then allow them to sell assets and realise substantial profits without
readers of accounts being aware of how the profits were generated.
How far companies will obey any new standard along the lines proposed by the
board remains to be seen. A more detailed 'exposure' draft fleshing out the
details on acquisition accounting is not expected before late this year. A
standard would not be adopted by companies for at least a year after that.
It will be interesting to see how flexible the board will be to amendments
in the face of strong opposition.
Then there will be the tension over implementation. A number of companies
which have paid lip-service to previous standards have then bent the rules
and obeyed the letter rather than spirit when they come to report.
The question is, will Mr Tweedie and the new financial reporting machinery
be swallowed in their efforts to destroy the black hole?

FT  02 APR 93 / Sale move over atomic agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Atomic Energy Authority took a step closer to privatisation yesterday as
the government announced that it was commissioning a report on the
practicability of moving the nuclear and industrial research agency into the
private sector.
This fresh evidence of the government's determination to press ahead with
privatisation was welcomed by the authority, which now operates under the
name of AEA Technology under an increasingly commercial management.
The business has changed substantially since the authority was set up in the
1950s to create a civil nuclear power programme. AEA has found markets in
new, non-nuclear fields, such as the transport and aerospace industries.
Since 1986 the agency has operated as a trading fund and sees privatisation
as a natural next step. Last year it made a profit of Pounds 28m on a
turnover of more than Pounds 400m.
The main question mark over privatisation is what should happen to the
agency's nuclear liabilities, covering radioactive sites such as the
Dounreay fast reactor on the north coast of Scotland which is scheduled to
stop operating next year.
The liabilities are estimated to amount to Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn and the
AEA is keen that they should be left behind in the public sector.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, told MPs that he was appointing
independent consultants to advise on the main ways in which this could be
done. Their report is expected in the autumn.
The AEA will be pressing the argument for being privatised as a single
entity.
Making the announcement, Mr Eggar referred to the report of the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission last May which urged a further review of strategic
options, including removing the AEA's business activities from the public
sector.

FT  02 APR 93 / Opt-out schools rapped for finance weaknesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESSES IN financial controls are causing difficulties for the
grant-maintained schools which opt out of local education authority control,
says a report published today by the National Audit Office.
The public expenditure watchdog said the opt-out schools needed to tighten
their internal controls, financial reporting, control of assets and
purchasing procedures.
Most have made efforts to improve financial controls, the report says, with
weaknesses identified immediately after opting-out progressively remedied
within the first two years.
However, pressure of time and inexperience in financial matters meant that
the schools had not implemented features of good practice recommended by
their auditors.
The NAO recommends that the Department for Education should be more active
in following up school auditors' reports on shortcomings.
Some of the schools visited by the NAO had failed to segregate key financial
duties such as custody and recording of cash. Most of the computerised
accounting systems inspected lacked important requirements of financial
control, such as double-entry book-keeping.
Few of the schools visited fully costed their business plans. The
government's leading curriculum adviser yesterday recommended a review of
the national school tests which are threatened with boycotts by teaching
unions.
Mr David Pascall, chairman of the National Curriculum Council, told a
conference in Oxford that the national curriculum taught in primary schools
was overloaded.

FT  02 APR 93 / Bank publishes guide to gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE latest move to ease the pressure of funding the government's heavy
borrowing requirement for the next financial year, the Bank of England
yesterday for the first time published a free guide for private investors on
investing in government stock, or gilts.
The guide explains how private investors can buy and sell gilts. With a
forecast public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, the
Bank is looking at several ways of making gilts more attractive to as wide a
range of investors as possible. It expects to publish a guide to the gilts
market aimed at foreign investors shortly.
Private investors have shown considerable interest in buying gilts,
especially since last autumn when sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism - paving the way for steady cuts in the base rate.
Dealers said that private investors have been keen to switch into government
stock because of the attractive long-term interest rates available and the
opportunities for making capital gains.
However, the surge in private investor interest took the market by surprise
in November, causing a log-jam in the settlement system for a few days.
The Bank remains confident that in future the gilt-edged market should be
capable of coping with a rush of private investors switching into gilts.
Further changes are being introduced to make gilts more attractive to
private investors.
With effect from April 7, private investors will be able to buy up to Pounds
25,000 per stock per day through the National Savings Stock Register (NSSR),
raising the upper limit from Pounds 10,000.
At present, investors can only buy from a restricted list of stocks via the
NSSR, but this list will be increased to include all stock during 1993.
Dealers welcomed the Bank's measures.
'These steps will enhance the attraction of gilts,' said one marketmaker.
However, one dealer suggested that private investors would be encouraged to
buy more gilts if the Bank provided a wider variety of stocks available at
below-par.

FT  02 APR 93 / Watchdog acts to cut electricity bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFER, the electricity industry regulator, has allowed generators to make
unlimited sales directly to customers in a move which could help cut bills
for medium to large power users.
The decision, effective from yesterday, is the latest in a series of
measures to liberalise the market with the eventual aim of forcing prices
down.
Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said that the
relaxation would not in itself result in a large reduction in prices but
might encourage generators to pass on lower coal prices to customers.
'The generators can bring down prices,' he said. 'Whether they will remains
to be seen. This is one further step towards the competitive market we have
been looking for.'
Mr Simon Williams, electricity analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the investment
bank, said the relaxation would bring pricing pressures to bear through
greater competition.
Under rules introduced during privatisation of the electricity industry
three years ago, National Power and PowerGen, generators for England and
Wales, could sell electricity directly to only a proportion of customers in
each of the 12 electricity regions.
Most of the direct sales market was restricted to the 12 regional
electricity companies. Relaxations of the rules last year restricted the
generators to 9 per cent, 15 per cent or 17.5 per cent of any regional
company, depending on the industrial make-up of any region.
Offer's latest ruling will end the limits altogether, enabling National
Power and PowerGen to compete to supply the whole of the 'non-franchise'
market.
The non-franchise market is limited to about 5,000 customers who use more
than one megawatt of electricity in any one half-hour period. From next
year, in a further liberalisation of the market, the threshold will fall to
100 kilowatts, bringing in another 50,000 customers to the competitive
market.
In recent months PowerGen has been pitching for a larger share of the direct
supplies market. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said yesterday that
competition would benefit customers and relaxation of 'artificial limits'
was a positive move.
Yesterday's relaxation is likely to have more effect on sales to medium
customers than large ones, many of whom have recently started to buy
electricity from the pool wholesale market.
However, in the relaxed regime, the generators will not be able to sell
electricity directly to customers at a lower price they quote to regional
power companies.
National Power and PowerGen say they are already passing through the effects
of lower coal prices.

FT  02 APR 93 / Japanese swords far exceed estimates: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL but choice collection of Japanese swords belonging to the late
Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, the only non-Japanese to be made a member
of the Japanese Sword Society, fetched prices far exceeding estimates at
Sotheby's in London yesterday.
The top price of Pounds 265,500 was paid by a Japanese dealer for a long
sword blade (katana) by Yamaura Tamaki Masayuki, dated 1839 but made using
13th century techniques. Trade bidding from Japan, Europe and the US secured
most of the 38 lots, in many cases for private clients. The collection, one
of the finest outside Japan, realised Pounds 754,373, with 98 per cent sold
by value.
At Wednesday's sale of the Swedlow collection of Japanese works of art,
oriental art dealers Eskenazi encountered little competition from trade or
private bidders, securing five out of the six top lots.
The London firm paid Pounds 52,100 for a highly unusual black lacquer inro
(small box) inlaid with black metal alloy and gold, signed by the
19th-century craftsmen Hara Yoyusai and Haruaki Hogen.
The Swedlow collection of inro was one of the finest to come on the market
in the past 20 years. Many of the more important pieces were bought in
against high estimates. The Swedlow netsuke (carved ivory) fared better,
with only 14 per cent unsold.
Sotheby's had expected the collection to realise Pounds 1.2m. It made Pounds
380,080 with only 41 per cent sold by value.

FT  02 APR 93 / Call for single broadcast regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday that the government
should consider a single regulatory body for all British broadcasting.
The commission, the regulatory body for commercial television, proposed in a
policy document sent to the government on the future of the BBC that the new
body should replace both itself and the BBC board of governors.
It said the intersection and overlapping in the jurisdictions of a number of
different bodies was 'already a source of serious confusion and concern'.
The commission also suggested a clearer line of separation between the
responsibilities of BBC governors and management, and that the governors
become a separate body with their own support staff. The licence fee could
be paid to the BBC via the governors on the basis of an agreed corporate
plan.
The BBC should continue to provide a wide range of programmes, it said, but
the corporation should not be allowed to extend its activities further - for
example into city-based local television.

FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: The new French government finds itself in
an old corner - EC trade and agricultural meeting allows Paris scope to
escape from a tight spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is nervously awaiting the Euro-debut on Monday of
France's new centre-right government to see whether its election rhetoric
about hard-won deals on farm trade and agricultural reform will become
policy.
In Luxembourg, EC foreign ministers will look again at whether to endorse
the EC-US agreement on oilseeds reached last November in Washington. But
they will not push for a vote, aiming to give the new French government room
to get out of the corner it entered.
The outgoing Socialists in Paris refused to sanction the Washington deal.
But the coalition of neo-Gaullists and centrists now in power has threatened
to veto the whole farm trade pact with the US and seek renegotiation of the
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed last May.
The Washington agreement staved off an incipient transatlantic trade war and
laid the basis for ending more than six years of world trade reform
negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Furthermore, majority opinion in the 12, and the now unanimous opinion of
the European Commission that negotiated it, is that the Washington deal was
better than the EC could have hoped. It needs to be 'banked' quickly,
Brussels insists, lest Washington in its present assertive mood try to
'rebalance' the deal in its favour.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Brussels this week for tough
negotiations on the public procurement row, confirmed 'we continue to look
at it (the Washington accord)' which could 'not be seen in isolation from an
overall package' including greatly im-proved access for US goods, farm
produce and services.
The oilseeds part of the deal is separate from the Uruguay Round proper,
coming after two Gatt panels condemned the EC's regime of subsidies for
rapeseed and soya producers as illicit. It is, though, as one EC ambassador
puts it, 'the front ship in the convoy'.
France opposes the oilseeds deal, even though it allows the EC to plant the
same acreage as envisaged under the CAP reform of last May - an outcome
which improved on the 'bottom line' Paris drew at the time. France,
moreover, affixed its signature to the unanimous agreement on the new CAP
when it passed into EC law at the end of last June.
Since November, French officials have systematically tried to refute
Commission claims that EC undertakings within Gatt are compatible with the
new CAP. A recent report by senior agriculture officials of the 12 has
concluded that they are - provided the Commission's assumptions are correct
about yield and output in 1994-99, particularly for cereals.
While Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist leader with his sights now set on
the French presidency in 1995, and his colleagues may be concerned to
preserve the French rural vote, which traditionally backs Gaullism anyway,
the substantive French concern is to protect its lucrative cereals trade.
Agreement within Gatt would restrict subsidised cereals exports. But
Brussels believes the EC's exportable surplus in 1999 will be well below the
Gatt ceiling, because the CAP reform's deep price cuts will enable cereals
farmers to recapture domestic markets lost to cheap US cereals substitutes.
The French want a stronger 'rebalancing' clause in the EC-US deal - meaning
restraints on US cereals substitutes equal to cuts in EC cereals subsidies
and exports.
The problem for France is that the clause in the existing agreement is
copied word for word from a draft prepared by the office of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany, France's main ally. Mr Edouard Balladur, the new
French prime minister, is seeking to strengthen the Paris-Bonn axis.
France wants to cement German backing for its franc fort policy at a time
when Bonn has accorded top priority to a Uruguay Round deal to improve its
worsening economic outlook, and started publicly to remonstrate with Paris
over its protectionism.
'The French must be allowed time,' counsels one EC ambassador. 'Or rather
the Germans must be allowed time' to persuade Paris of the advantages of an
overall settlement, he said.
Help might emerge in various guises. This week the EC statistics office
reported a 1992 fall in real farm income across the Community of 3.5 per
cent - but only 0.9 per cent in France. These results are the product of the
old and failed system of mandatory 'stabilisers' on output - that is, cuts
without compensation.
But the Commission is still deciding whether to circulate its projections on
farm income under the reformed CAP, with its generous compensation for cuts
in production.
These show significant gains for all except big cereals farmers (see table).
The grain barons of the Paris Basin see a sharp fall in their subsidised
surplus earnings; but there are many more French farm votes in the winning
categories.
There is also a suggestive precedent. In February 1988, Germany deserted its
French ally when the 'stabilisers' regime was introduced. But Mr Chirac,
then prime minister, was able to return home and immediately announce
massive state aids for farmers while, as one EC ambassador put it, 'we all
looked the other way'.
Germany itself has just had a big, three-year national farm aid programme
pushed through on the nod. It is well within the bounds of credibility that
France might get similar treatment later this year, if the aid is
Gatt-compatible.

BRAZIL'S Congress approved the federal budget for this year late on
Wednesday, after the most tempestuous negotiations of recent times.
But government officials are forecasting a budget deficit of the equivalent
of Dollars 10bn, which would destroy hopes of a new accord with the
International Monetary Fund or any early reduction of inflation, now at 27
per cent a month.
The Treasury showed a deficit of Dollars 400m last month - the first for
more than two years and underlining the parlous state of the country's
finances.
Also, the Dollars 234bn budget, formulated last August, includes no
provision for a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in state pensions or a
newly approved 33 per cent wage rise for government employees.
The main expense is service of the government's Dollars 136bn domestic debt.
This will consume 65 per cent of the budget. Analysts say that the primary
surplus of 2.1 per cent of GDP last year was achieved largely by deferring
spending.

FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: US administration no longer has eyes
solely for Tokyo - Subtle changes in the relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Washington for talks with the Clinton administration recently, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was very diplomatic in public. As far
as putting together an assistance package for Russia was concerned, he
declared that Japan had 'behaved correctly and shrewdly as chairman of the
G7'.
Privately, a senior British official was willing to impart a subtle nuance.
'The great US concern,' he said, 'was not to undermine Japanese leadership
of the G7, to which Japan attaches such importance.'
Thus the question of an emergency summit of the leaders of the
industrialised nations after a ministerial meeting in Tokyo in mid-April,
but before the scheduled annual get-together in the Japanese capital in
July, had been 'held in reserve for the moment'.
There is no reason to dispute either version. Whatever its motivations and
its misgivings, Japan has a lot to offer Russia by way of practical
assistance and the meeting of foreign and finance ministers may well be
substantive.
It would also be true to form that Washington would not want to be seen to
put at risk its considerable leverage over Tokyo, even to the extent of
indulging the formalistic Japanese obsession with 'great events',
particularly when it plays host.
However, publicly and privately senior members of the US administration are
prepared to be less kind. President Bill Clinton himself used his first
formal press conference to deliver a frontal assault on the intractability
of Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the US. Mr Mickey Kantor, his trade
representative, complains about Japan's refusal to engage in serious
discussions about the Uruguay Round.
Other officials have been talking freely of the need for 'managed trade' and
quantitative targets in negotiations with Japan. Reports from Tokyo are of
increasing scepticism from the US Treasury about the details of Japanese
macro-economic policies.
This is not at all what Japan has come to expect of its relationship with
Washington. No matter how many Japanese radios were smashed on the lawns of
Congress, no matter how many political candidates threatened dark
retaliations, there was always the assumption that at least the president
understood that Japan required special treatment.
Yet this was a Cold War protection, understandable when Japan, harbouring
860,000 US military personnel and blithely denying that US nuclear weapons
ever entered its territory in violation of its own non-nuclear policies, was
a necessary US strategic bulwark in Asia.
North Korea's renunciation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty recently
was a tart reminder of potential instability but even before that the
Clinton administration, unlike that of President Jimmy Carter, had shown no
inclination to flutter the Asian dovecotes further by contemplating military
withdrawal.
But, in the new administration's holistic view of the world, relations with
other countries are no longer defined solely on the basis of their value as
security assets, with all other aspects, such as trade, confined to
separate, insulated compartments. As repeatedly explained by Mr Clinton
himself, national security now has a big economic component - and the US
Congress, if differently motivated, agrees with him.
This is precisely why Japan, once comfortable in the certitudes of the Cold
War and in its recognition as a fully paid-up member of the G7, is currently
discomfited. It does not help that its own economy is under unaccustomed
duress and that its political leadership is more than usually weak and
introspective.
This puts the US on the horns of a dilemma. At the very least, Japan was a
dependable ally. If it could not send troops to the Gulf, it did send money
(now, as in Cambodia, it is doing both). If it was exhorted to expand its
economy to help global growth, it usually obliged (though the capacity to do
so now may be more limited).
Its contributions were enough that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of
state, was prepared to acknowledge recently that, in theory, Japan's case
for permanent membership of the UN Security Council had, along with
Germany's, been made.
Barring a miracle, it is unlikely that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, will get an assurance, if he has the nerve to seek it from Mr
Clinton when he comes to Washington in the middle of this month, that the US
will push its case at the UN.
It will not be enough for Japan to offer a trade concession here and an
economic stimulus package there. Japan is facing the necessity, perhaps for
the first time in the post-war years in what both sides still
ritualistically call 'the most important bilateral relationship in the
world', of widening its own horizons, of broadening its own perception of
national self-interest, in order to continue to enjoy US trust and even
protection.
As the senior British official noted, the emergency G7 summit to assist
Russia is still 'held in reserve', not shelved for good. The July summit can
still have its place in the Japanese sun, but only if the industrialised
world acts in the meanwhile, assuming there is something to act on and with.
Helping Russia, in the US view, now matters more than catering to Japanese
sensibilities. That is a serious, if still not irrevocable, sea change for
Japan.

THE CLINTON administration this week demonstrated the tough stance officials
have been threatening when US trading partners fail to keep trade
agreements.
In reviewing a 1992 agreement with Korea over telecommunications, they
discovered that Korea had failed to institute, as promised, 'a completely
transparent and non-discriminatory procurement system' for Korea Telecom,
the monopoly telephone company, and that it only made public regulations
which were no longer applicable.
Furthermore, US telecommunications companies, having been promised a fair
opportunity to bid on government contracts, were facing a complete exclusion
from the market for network switching.
During two days of talks from Tuesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade
Representative, backed by the entire administration, threatened to cite
Korea for violating a trade agreement and to announce sanctions.
'Korea said it would rectify the situation,' he said in a press briefing.
'It will make public all relevant regulations, and it guaranteed there will
be no delay in publishing regulations in future.'
Promising again not to discriminate, Korea has now put AT&amp;T of the US on the
list of companies qualified to bid for a contract worth at least Dollars
30m.
He said the US also would insist that Japan honour agreements made last year
to increase the purchase of US motor vehicle parts and raise the domestic
content of vehicles produced by Japanese companies in the US to 70 per cent.
Japanese officials are portraying the agreements as between US and Japanese
companies, and therefore not binding on the respective governments.

CHILE and Venezuela are due to sign today a free trade agreement which is
expected to help Chile close a trade deficit with its third largest partner
in Latin America.
Mr Jorge Marshall, Chilean trade and industry minister, said the agreement,
due to take effect on July 1, would let Chile double exports to Venezuela
within the next two years. Exports in 1992 totalled Dollars 75m, against
imports of about Dollars 120m from Venezuela.
A similar agreement with Mexico in 1991 triggered an 80 per cent increase of
Chilean trade with that country last year, to about Dollars 80m.
Chile's strategy has been to pursue bilateral trade pacts with like-minded
countries. Colombia and Bolivia are next on the list.
Under the accord with Venezuela, import tariffs will be eliminated on 90 per
cent of goods by January 1997. Venezuelan-made vehicles, however, will enjoy
a zero import tariff from the start of the agreement. A small group of
'sensitive goods' - including petrochemicals, tobacco, wood, sugar and dairy
products - has been excluded from the free trade agreement.

FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Call to veto aircraft subsidy laws -
Brussels voices concern over Washington attacks on Airbus
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community has urged President Bill Clinton to veto proposed
legislation relating to subsidies for aircraft manufacturers, claiming it
could run counter to existing trade agreements.
EC officials voiced concern about the bills, introduced over the past few
weeks, during consultations with their US counterparts about last year's
EC-US agreement limiting subsidies to manufacturers of large civil aircraft.
The legislation put forward by leading US senators calls for dumping and
subsidy complaints against the European Airbus consortium, as well as
increased indirect support for US manufacturers.
US officials said after the talks ended in Brussels yesterday that the
administration had already expressed doubts about some of the proposed
measures. It would inform Congress where it believed legislation was
contrary to other trade commitments.
The EC used the consultations to express its unhappiness with recent US
pronouncements attacking subsidies for Airbus.
EC officials said they were pleased that the Clinton administration had made
clear that last year's agreement should not be renegotiated, but criticised
him for adding to uncertainty in the fragile civil aircraft market. 'These
declarations have let the genie out of the bottle,' said one.
The US, in turn, complained about EC suggestions that it might already have
breached the limits on indirect subsidies to its manufacturers.
'We don't believe there's any question that the US is living up to its
obligations,' said one senior US trade official after the talks, which both
sides described as constructive.
The EC is calling on the US to provide more information about indirect
support to the US aircraft industry since the agreement came into force last
July, in line with clauses calling for greater transparency.

MR Sergei Glaziev, Russia's foreign economic relations minister, yesterday
called for an end to western trade barriers to Russian goods and services,
saying trade was far more useful than more aid.
He said he hoped western barriers would be tackled by western leaders, and
that early results would be achieved during President Boris Yeltsin's summit
with President Bill Clinton at the weekend.
'We are not asking for additional credits. Our main demands are for access
to the markets of developed countries and an end to discrimination against
Russian goods,' he said. Outlining a programme to stimulate the export of
manufactured goods, he said Russia was counting mainly on increased sales to
developing countries.
But he said that, by applying pressure on governments to close markets to
Russian exports, western companies were guilty of unfair competition. He
cited as a 'classic example' the closing of US markets to uranium exports.
Mr Glaziev's comments reflected growing frustration about what is seen as
western hypocrisy in proclaiming the need to help Russia but not giving it
the chance to help itself.
He said, for instance, that revenues from uranium exports could help finance
the conversion of defence plants to civilian uses. 'Just think how the US
could save budget expenditures by not giving us credits (for this purpose)
but giving us market access.'
He also complained that the end of the cold war had put Russian arms exports
at a disadvantage because Moscow, unlike the US, did not have the political
clout to force countries to buy its weapons.
Although western European companies have complained about Russian dumping of
metals such as aluminium, he cited what he called undeniable examples of the
west closing its doors to the few Russian manufactured goods and services
which can compete with the west.
One example is satellite-launching services, which Russia can provide at
half the price of western Europe's Arianespace but where Russia has agreed
to voluntary quotas and price floors. 'Negotiations have been going on for
more than a year and still there is no end in sight,' he said.
Reuter reports from Bonn: Germany and the ex-Soviet republic of Belarus will
sign accords on economic co-operation and investor protection today, the
German economics ministry said yesterday.
The pact includes guarantees that German investors will be able to move
capital freely in and out of Belarus.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH houses of the US Congress completed work on President Bill Clinton's
outline budget yesterday, passing a blueprint for trimming the federal
budget deficit to about Dollars 192bn by 1997.
This was evidence of a display of legislative muscle that few US presidents
have been able to match in recent years.
Even so, the resolution provides only a budget outline, and the hard work of
passing individual taxation and spending measures is only just beginning. A
detailed bill is expected to make its way through Congress over the summer.
This would include the increases in top income tax rates and in corporate
tax rates, as well as the new energy tax that Mr Clinton has proposed.
Details are to be sent to Congress in a fuller budget next week.
The outline projects a Dollars 273bn increase in taxes during the next five
years over the baseline budget published by President George Bush shortly
before he left office in January, coupled with cuts of Dollars 106bn in
defence spending and Dollars 117bn in other spending areas.
Some of Mr Clinton's supporters worry that he may have opened the door to a
breakdown in Democratic party solidarity by concessions he made this week to
senators in western and farm states so as to win their backing for the
budget measure.
The Senate has so far provided President Clinton with his toughest
challenges. It is now delaying the Dollars 16bn package of short-term
stimulus to spending that the president wants in order to accompany his
longer-term economic plan.
Mr Charles Cook, a veteran political analyst, observes that a good number of
Democrats in the Senate not only see themselves as more worthy of the
presidency than Mr Clinton, but honestly (and, in most cases, inaccurately)
believe that, if they had run last year, they would now be in the White
House.
The Clinton budget proposals, and the relatively warm reaction in Congress,
have encouraged financial markets to believe that the federal government may
be making at last a serious attempt to deal with its deficit, bringing
long-term interest rates sharply lower.
However, the administration's hopes of bringing the deficit under more
lasting control hinge on its plans to reform the US health care system,
expected to be unveiled next month.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MANUFACTURING industry is still expanding, but the pace of growth has
slowed since the start of the year, the National Association of Purchasing
Managers reported yesterday.
The Purchasing Managers Index fell for the second month running in March to
stand at 53.4 per cent, the lowest level since October. This was well above
the 50 per cent threshold which indicates growth in the sector but sharply
lower than January's 58 per cent.
The greatest weakness was in export markets: in March the sub-index for new
export orders fell below 50 per cent for the first time since the
association began collecting export data in 1988, 'reflecting the slowing in
the economies of our major trading partners'.
The overall index is based on a survey of 300 companies and is regarded as a
reliable indicator of trends in manufacturing.
Mr Robert Bretz, an association spokesman, said there were 'encouraging
signals for continued moderate growth in the economy'. Within the
manufacturing sector 16 of 20 industries reported growth last month. The
average level of the index in the first quarter, moreover, was well above
the average for 1992, which saw a significant rise in gross domestic
product.
However, said Mr Bretz the rate of growth of production appeared sharply
lower than in February. Growth of new orders was also declining.
The fall in the purchasing managers' index follows a number of mildly
discouraging economic reports, including confirmation this week that the
post-election surge in consumer confidence late last year has largely
evaporated.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday made his strongest plea to date for the US
to support the cause of reform in Russia, warning of civil conflict like
Yugoslavia's, but on a much more dramatic scale, if the reforms are not
successful.
'The danger is clear if Russia's reforms turn sour - if it reverts to
authoritarianism or disintegrates into chaos,' he said before setting out
for his weekend summit with President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver. 'The world
cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia replicated in a nation as
big as Russia, spanning 11 time zones with an armed arsenal of nuclear
weapons that is still very vast.'
Mr Clinton gave no details of the aid package he will offer Mr Yeltsin but
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said earlier that most of the
money would come from funds approved by Congress over the last two years but
not spent because of bottlenecks in Russia and Washington. The package is
expected to contain help with construction, privatisation and energy
projects, and an 'enterprise fund' to help small businesses, as well as
grain credits and medical supplies.
In Moscow, Mr Sergei Glaziev, Russia's foreign economic relations minister,
yesterday called for an end to western trade barriers to Russian goods and
services, saying trade was far more useful than more aid. He hoped the
barriers would be tackled by western leaders and that early results would be

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S Congress approved the federal budget for this year late on
Wednesday, after the most tempestuous negotiations of recent times.
But government officials are forecasting a budget deficit of the equivalent
of Dollars 10bn, which would destroy hopes of a new accord with the
International Monetary Fund or any early reduction of inflation, now at 27
per cent a month.
The Treasury showed a deficit of Dollars 400m last month - the first for
more than two years and underlining the parlous state of the country's
finances.
Also, the Dollars 234bn budget, formulated last August, includes no
provision for a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in state pensions, for a
newly approved 33 per cent wage rise for government employees, or for
President Itamar Franco's declared campaign on poverty.
The main expense is service of the government's Dollars 136bn domestic debt.
This will consume 65 per cent of the budget. Analysts say that the primary
surplus of 2.1 per cent of GDP last year was achieved largely by deferring
such as public sector pay rises, pension increases and infrastructure
repairs.
Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a consultant and former finance minister, says there
is 'no longer any disguising the fact that the state is bankrupt. Compulsory
expenses alone consume more than revenues.'
Under the 1988 constitution, the federal government has little leeway, 90-95
per cent of the budget being consumed by compulsory transfers of taxes to
the various states and municipalities, and federal employees being protected
by guarantee of tenure.
New taxes seem to be the government's only recourse, although a newly
approved tax on cheques has already been weakened and is expected to raise
only Dollars 4bn - less than half original predictions.
Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister, says he expects no reduction in
inflation until October, when he hopes for a constitutional amendment to
allow fiscal reform.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday signed a Dollars
300m contract for AXE switching equipment with China's Guangdong Post and
Telecommunications Bureau, its biggest ever contract in one of its fastest
growing markets.
The accord formalises a framework agreement reached last June.
The deal covers AXE-10 switching equipment, transmission and cooling
equipment which will be delivered from Sweden between 1993 and 1995.
Last year Ericsson signed framework agreements and memorandums of
understanding for more than Dollars 900m with China, which is now its eighth
largest market.

FOUR US-based members of an extremist Palestinian guerrilla group have been
charged with plotting to commit terrorist acts, murder Jews and blow up the
Israeli embassy in Washington, the Justice Department said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington.
Apart from the murder of the teenage daughter of one of the defendants,
there was no evidence that the accused members of the Abu Nidal group
carried out their plans or were connected with the February 26 bombing of
the New York World Trade Centre that killed six people and wounded over
1,000.
The charges were announced by the Justice Department a day after it was
returned in secret by a federal grand jury in St Louis, Missouri.
Accused were Tawfiq Musa of Milwaukee and Zein Isa, Saif Nijmeh and Luie
Nijmeh, all from St Louis. Isa already had been in custody while the three
others were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday.
They were all charged with conducting a criminal racketeering enterprise
since 1986.

Indian police investigating a bombing blitz which killed at least 250 people
and injured 1,400 in Bombay last month said yesterday they had arrested 14
more people, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Bombay police chief Amarjeet Singh Samra said three of them were trained
abroad in handling explosives of the type used in the Cannot distribute
vertically 13 blasts which ripped through India's commercial capital on
March 12.
He said nine of those arrested were involved in landing the explosives and
were detained at Raigadh on the west coast of Maharashtra state, of which
Bombay is the capital. The other five were arrested in Bombay. A total of 44
people are now being held in connection with the bombings, which police
suspect were organised by the Memon family, a group of alleged gold and drug
smugglers.
The Press Trust of India said one of those arrested was a driver for the
Memon brothers. Mr Samra said police seized two AK-47 rifles, and eight hand
grenades.

<TEXT>
SHRINKING markets in the former Soviet bloc and a spate of violence at home
has dented India's plans to boost exports as part of its new economic
strategy.
Allowing for some recovery after the recent riots, the commerce ministry
says it now expects India to record export growth of 3.5 to 4.0 per cent for
the year to the end of March 1993, compared with a target of 15-16 per cent.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian commerce minister, yesterday expressed
growing concern at the country's faltering rate of export growth, as he
announced details of new measures to liberalise trade and promote exports,
notably in agricultural products.
The Indian government, which is trying to reform the economy and integrate
India into the global trading system, sees exports as a vital element in
economic growth.
But growth has been held back by a slump in sales to countries of the former
Soviet Union and eastern bloc, once important trading partners.
The riots that followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in November
last year have also seriously disrupted trade.
After increasing steadily in the late summer and autumn of 1992, export
growth has faded. Exports fell 12.5 per cent in December and 6.9 per cent in
January, compared with the same months a year earlier.
Slower than expected growth in industrial exports is a major reason for the
trade package announced this week, which concentrates on measures to promote
agricultural exports.
In a wide-ranging liberalisation of agricultural trade, India is to
encourage the establishment of export-oriented farms and food processing
units.
It is also removing bans on the export of a host of staple products,
including cereals and sugar. Altogether 144 items are being removed from a
list of goods banned for export, leaving 190 still on the list.
The ministry believes that agricultural and fisheries exports could rise
from an estimated Dollars 2.47bn (Pounds 1.64bn) in 1992-93 to Dollars 3bn
next year and Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn by 1997-98.
These figures exclude exports of plantation products such as tea and coffee,
which are separately classified by the ministry and which total about a
further Dollars 1bn a year.
Mr Mukherjee said flowers, fruits and vegetables were all areas in which
India had 'immense potential', but success in exporting to developed
countries would partly depend on the outcome of the Uruguay Round of Gatt
trade talks.

THE PAKISTAN government, stung by the latest allegations that Islamabad
supports terrorism, has intensified its efforts to avoid being listed as a
terrorist state by the US.
Mr Shujaat Hussain, the interior minister, said yesterday the government had
detained nine suspected Arab guerrillas and would try to decide the fate of
all Arabs in Pakistan within a month.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state, claimed at the
weekend he had evidence that those responsible for the bomb blasts that
shook Bombay last month were supported by a group in Pakistan, possibly the
elite Inter Services Intelligence agency.
Other politicians have claimed that six members of a prominent Bombay
underworld family known as the Memons were paid by the ISI agency for
organising the blasts.
The ISI is widely known to have supplied western arms and training camps for
the Afghan mujahideen to support them first against Soviet troops and
subsequently against Moscow-backed governments.
Islamabad is fighting to clear its name after the US in January added
Pakistan to a 'watch list' of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism.
The US is due to report on the situation at the end of this month.
Islamabad claims that the Indian allegations are meant to encourage
Washington to press ahead with the terrorism charge, and the bombings could
be the work of Indian intelligence agencies trying to malign Pakistan.
'Pakistan is under threat constantly of being declared a terrorist state,'
says Mr Akram Zaki, secretary general of foreign affairs.
'For India there is greater motivation to shift the attention from violation
of human rights in Kashmir, from the communal riots and killing of Moslems
in India to an external factor, and therefore if any one of the intelligence
agencies is involved, Indians are more likely to be involved than the
Pakistanis,' he adds.
These charges seem bound to sour already strained relations between India
and Pakistan, although some Indian politicians have held back from directly
venting anger against Moslems or Pakistan, fearing fresh communal riots
similar to those after last year's destruction of the Babri mosque at
Ayodhya.
Both countries have traded similar charges in the past. India has accused
Pakistan of supporting terrorism in Punjab and Kashmir, where dissident
Sikhs and Moslem activists are struggling for independence.
Indian authorities allege that the ISI has being trying to link dissidents
in the two troubled states in an attempt to create widespread instability in
their country.
Pakistan has countered by alleging that India is responsible for extending
large-scale support to dissident nationalists in the troubled southern
province of Sindh and is trying to destabilise the economy through creating
unrest in and around Karachi.
Even before the latest accusations, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
embarked on a diplomatic initiative to convince western countries that the
terrorism charges are false.
Last month Pakistan invited foreign journalists and human rights groups to
travel freely across the country and verify any charges.
It has also set up an anti-terrorist cell in the Interior Ministry to
counter violence in Pakistan.
While the government has gone out of its way to present what one senior
diplomat describes as 'a very clean image', that has not put to rest
concerns over the activities of Islamic nationalists.
The Uzbek foreign minister last month accused Pakistan's Jamaat-i-Islami
politicial party of fomenting unrest in the central Asian republic of
Tajikistan, where Islamic nationalists are waging an anti-government
campaign.
Other groups being watched are Kashmiri militants such as the Jammu Kashmir
Liberation Front and Arab Moslem activists who came to Pakistan during the
Afghan conflict to join the jihad (holy war). The war opened a new pipeline
of money and CIA-supplied arms to the Afghan mujahideen.
Islamabad has been trying to clamp down on the activities of such groups.
But officials say this cannot be done overnight.

FT  02 APR 93 / N Korea nuclear dispute goes to the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL pressure on North Korea to co-operate with nuclear inspections
was stepped up yesterday when the International Atomic Energy Agency decided
to refer the case to the United Nations Security Council.
A two-day meeting of the IAEA's 35 governors in Vienna, which was forced to
take a vote on the issue, ruled that North Korea had broken an agreement on
nuclear safeguards. Mr Hans Blix, the agency's director general, is due to
report to the Security Council on the dispute in the next few days.
At the same time, the US, Britain and Russia issued a joint statement urging
North Korea to retract its announced withdrawal from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. The three countries, which are the depositaries of
the 1968 treaty designed to stop the spread of nuclear arms, said withdrawal
would be 'a serious threat to regional and international stability.'
They said it was in North Korea's interests to stay in the treaty and called
on it to comply fully with the safeguards agreement it signed with the IAEA
in January last year.
North Korea accepted six inspection visits before refusing access to two
facilities near its Yongbyon nuclear reactor complex. It has claimed they
are conventional military facilities.
However, experts suspect that the country may have used more nuclear fuel,
and may have been able to separate more plutonium for possible weapon use,
than it has declared.
Without powers of its own to take action, the IAEA could do little else than
appeal to the Security Council - the first time it has done so.
However, it is unclear what the Council will do. China, which along with
Libya voted against yesterday's IAEA ruling, is opposed to sanctions,
arguing that it would be counterproductive to isolate North Korea further,
and would be able to use its veto in the Security Council.
Moreover, the rotating council chairmanship passes next week to Pakistan,
which was one of four IAEA governing board members to abstain in yesterday's
vote. The others were India, Syria and Vietnam.
North Korea is considered still to be bound by the terms of the treaty,
which stipulates three months' notice for withdrawal.

DR Abdul Ahad Guru, one of India's top heart surgeons and a prominent
supporter of the Kashmir rebellion, was killed yesterday, dealing a blow to
the government's plans to revive the political process in the state.
Dr Guru would have been a key figure in any attempt by the government to
negotiate with the militants, and his death yesterday will prove a strong
deterrent to any moderate voice in the state.
More than 12 people, including the dead doctor's brother-in-law, were later
killed when security forces opened fire on his funeral procession.
Small processions took to the streets defying curfew in some parts of
Srinagar, the capital, shouting anti-India slogans, and the mourners, for
whom killings by security forces and militants have become a daily feature
in the past three years, cried openly in the streets.
Dr Guru's body, shot at three times at close range, was found yesterday
morning.
He had been abducted on Wednesday by armed militants who hijacked his car as
he was driving to a meeting of the Supreme Revolutionary Command Council of
the militant Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front of which he was one of the
main leaders.
The JKLF and other militant groups accused Indian agents of killing him.
Home ministry officials blamed the militants.
The government is preparing a series of measures to try to solve the
three-year crisis in Kashmir. It has replaced the discredited state governor
and plans other personnel changes to revive the defunct administration, as
well as economic grants and an amnesty for some prisoners.
There are also plans to grant an amnesty to Kashmiris in custody against
whom there are no serious charges.
In Srinagar, militants are openly derisive of the government's approach.

clergymen.
Its members are seeking introduction of Islamic values in the country's
legal system, as well as in other areas, such as through the elimination of
bank interest.
Other groups whose activities are being watched are Kashmiri militants such

Pakistan during the Afghan conflict to join the jihad (holy war).
