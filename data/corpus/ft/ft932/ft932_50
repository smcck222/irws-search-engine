FT  02 APR 93 / China tries to win control of HK chamber

CHINA has stepped up its 'united front' activities in Hong Kong and is
taking steps to gain control of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,
the colony's leading business association, and the one which so far has
resisted its blandishments.
The moves came as a group of 49 Hong Kong personalities flew to Beijing
yesterday to receive letters of appointment as so-called 'advisers' to China
on Hong Kong affairs. The appointment of businessmen, politicians and former
civil servants are seen as yet another attempt to flout the authority of
Britain in the face of a growing row over democracy in Hong Kong.
Officials of the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong
Kong, have visited leading members of the chamber to instruct them how to
vote in forthcoming elections to its general committee.
Xinhua has told 'patriots' - its term for Chinese resident in Hong Kong -
that there is no distinction between business and politics. Many companies
fear their business prospects in China and Hong Kong will be adversely
affected if they do not support Beijing's candidates.
At least two seats on the general committee need to be filled by the end of
April, due to the retirement of directors.
Xinhua has told some leading member companies that they should support Mr
James Tien, a Shanghai-born industrialist. The other candidate is believed
to be Mrs Nellie Fung, a partner of Arthur Anderson, the accountancy firm,
who is responsible for its China practice.
The chamber elects one member to the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo),
Hong Kong's 60-member law making body, and the move by Xinhua is seen as an
attempt by Beijing to gain influence over who the chamber promotes as its
candidate for the colony's 1995 elections.
Mr Jimmy McGregor, who is a vocal supporter of Mr Chris Patten, the
governor, is currently the sitting member for the chamber. He won a
contested election for the chamber's 'functional' constituency in 1991,
defeating Mr Paul Cheng, the head of Inchcape, the UK trading house.
China already controls three business-related seats in LegCo - Chinese
Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong Federation of Industry, and Chinese
Manufacturers Association - and the addition of the Hong Kong chamber would
increase its hold over the legislature.
In Hong Kong on Wednesday night Mr Patten said the government was still
happy to hold talks with Beijing but negotiations would be difficult.
'Britain and the Hong Kong government would be very happy to see talks
starting tomorrow,' but the difficulties over the last couple of months
suggest 'talks would be anything but a pushover,' he said.
Mr Patten was leaving for a trip to Britain where he will review policy with
Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The Hong Kong
governor said Britain had repeatedly tried to start talks with Beijing since
October 'on exactly the same basis that we've been talking for the last
decade.'
On China's efforts to set up a working group which critics fear could become
a 'shadow authority' fuelling conflict before 1997, Mr Patten said:
'If China wishes to make administrative arrangements to try to help it
discharge responsibilities from the middle of 1997 more effectively, then so
be it. I hope the arrangements that it makes enable it to do its job more
conscientiously and more competently than would otherwise be the case.'
He said the Hong Kong government would not make a decision until after
Easter on when to send postponed legislation to the colony's legislature .
'We're responsible for Hong Kong while the 1994 and 1995 elections take
place and we can't duck out of that responsibility,' he said.

FT  02 APR 93 / Kurds enjoy taste of freedom under dual embargo: But at
times it is bitter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NORTHERN IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER the protection of Allied air cover, the 3.5m Kurds of northern Iraq
have built a functioning system of parliamentary government over a large
swathe of Iraqi territory. But after two winters of dual embargo from both
the United Nations and the Iraqi regime, they continue to face severe
economic problems.
Yellow and white narcissi, the symbol of spring, adorn tents, shacks and
houses. The Moslem festival of Eid was celebrated with traditional dancing,
song and open-air picnics in the bright sunshine.
But the Kurds are deeply apprehensive about the future. Around a million
live under Iraqi government control and a continuing stream of refugees from
government-held areas around Mosul and Kirkuk bring tales of continuing
harassment, arrests and beatings by Saddam's security forces.
Two weeks after Arab Lahib tribesmen and, survivors allege, Iraqi soldiers
massacred 15 Kurdish civilians on March 12 at the village of Awina - 20km
south west of Arbil and just outside the Kurdish-held zone - spent
Kalashnikov cartridges littered the ground outside deserted shelters, where
dried blood remained splattered on the walls.
The situation in the Kurdish-held cities of Arbil and Sulaymaniyah is tense.
Kurdish television clumsily paraded four captured terrorists last weekend in
an attempt to restore public confidence after a spate of bombings.
With an automatic rifle available on the black market for only 7,000 dinas
(Pounds 250) and a hand-grenade for only 30 dinas, a sizeable profit is
possible for anyone willing to accept substantial payment from Iraqi agents
to carry out terror missions against Kurdish civilians, UN staff or aid
workers.
In a move designed to place a stronger figure in charge of day-to-day
administration, former guerrilla commander Abdullah 'Koosrat' Rasoul will
soon replace the veteran Fua'd Ma'soum as the Kurds' 'prime minister' in the
cross-party government.
Mr Rasoul said: 'It is a change of faces, not of policy,' but admitted that
'everyone has his own style'.
Mr Rasoul will head a cabinet of 15 ministers responsible to a Kurdish
'parliament' elected in May 1992 and dominated by the two major parties -
Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Massoud Barzani's
Kurdistan Democratic Party, each of whom has 50 of the 105 seats.
The parliament acts as a legislative body for the 50,000sq km of northern
Iraq from which Iraqi president Saddam Hussein withdrew all administration
in November 1991 in response to the Allied creation of a 'security zone' to
protect the Kurdish population from attacks by Iraqi troops.
Iraqi laws passed before November 1991 continue in force, but those judged
by the Kurdish parliament to be 'against Kurdish interests' have been
frozen, and laws passed by since are not recognised.
Clan and party loyalties remain strong, but there is a general culture of
free debate and discussion. The parliament meets - in the former Arbil seat
of the Ba'athist regional legislative council - on alternate weeks, so
enabling representatives to spend half their time in the localities. A
number of Kurdish TV stations offer news, views and western cartoons, and a
wide range of newspapers, including the pro-Saddam Al-Iraq Al-Thaura, are on
sale.
Mr Rasoul identifies security as his top priority. Although a regular police
force has been established, the authorities have been only partly successful
in merging the guerrilla forces of the various Kurdish parties under a
single military command. Control of the borders with neighbouring states is
patchy, and a spate of bombings and attacks on UN staff are blamed on Iraqi
government agents.
Fully three quarters of government revenue is from 'customs levies', mainly
from trade passing through Kurdish-held territory between Turkey and the
Iraqi-controlled city of Mosul. The deficit on the 1993 budget is expected
to be between 25 and 30 per cent of total revenue.
The rebuilding of the 4,000 villages destroyed in Mr Saddam's 'Anfal'
operation or in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war is painfully slow. The Kurdish
leadership has exhorted the population to return to their farms and so ease
the dependence on western aid.
While more land is under cultivation than last spring - and more sheep and
goats graze on the hillside - productivity is diminished by a shortage of
fertiliser.
Inflation is around 35 per cent and the Iraqi dina has halved its value
against the dollar in one year. All spare parts are scarce. Power cuts occur
daily. Few people are gainfully employed and most factories are closed.
While bus services function between the bigger cities, only local telephone
calls are possible.
Some Kurdish leaders admit privately their fear of social unrest. But
although many ordinary Kurds raise complaints about unequal distribution of
aid and government benefits, they retain a belief that the Kurdish
government is 'doing its best'.
There is no appetite for accepting Mr Saddam's offer first made in November
1992 to lift the economic embargo in return for renewed negotiations over
Kurdish 'autonomy' from Baghdad.

SUSPECTED Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed 26 people and wounded 20 in a rifle
and rocket attack on a village video hall in central Cambodia, aUnited
Nations official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
One attacker was also killed. It was the third massacre within three weeks
believed to have been carried out by the group responsible for the murder of
over 1m Cambodians. All the villagers were ethnic Khmers and unarmed
civilians.
At least 10 attackers fired four rockets and automatic weapons in Snau
village, in the Kompong Svay district of Kompong Thom province.
The country had appeared to be heading towards peace after the signing of an
agreement in Paris in October 1991, formally ending 13 years of civil war
among four rival factions.
But thousands of ethnic Vietnamese are fleeing their homes along the Tonle
Sap (Great Lake) to escape violence, some aiming to leave Cambodia
altogether. At least 103 ethnic Vietnamese have been murdered since the
Paris pact was signed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN groups from across the political spectrum yesterday formally
resumed constitutional talks suspended since last May, but avoided
addressing any of the substantive issues blocking agreement on a
post-apartheid constitution.
The talks, which had been planned as a two-day session, ended after only one
day following agreement between the 26 parties to defer consideration of all
important issues - including the name of the forum, participation in
negotiations, as well as whether South Africa should be a federal or unitary
state - to a smaller 'negotiation council' due to meet on April 15.
Yesterday's meeting agreed certain procedural issues, such as how decisions
would be taken in future meetings. It was agreed that 'sufficient consensus'
would be required to take decisions. This means that participating parties
can be overruled if their opposition does not halt all progress in the
talks.
But all of the tough work of negotiation remains to be done.
Parties must agree on a bilateral proposal from the African National
Congress and the government for multi-party power-sharing, and the vexed
issue of the form of the state - federal or unitary - remains unresolved.
The parties discussed the issue of violence, which had been expected to
prove an obstacle to talks, without the kind of virulent verbal attacks
which had been expected.
However, the ruling National Party questioned the sincerity of one
conference participant, the Pan Africanist Congress, whose armed wing has
been accused of involvement in a number of recent murders of whites.

FT  02 APR 93 / Four nations to enforce no-fly zone in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US, BRITISH, French and possibly Dutch aircraft are expected to assume the
task of enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia after the UN Security Council
resolution on Wednesday night.
Nato officials said ambassadors of the 16 allies would meet shortly,
possibly today, to approve detailed plans. These are expected to involve
initially between 50 and 100 aircraft.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, lambasted the UN resolution,
warning it would fuel further violence. 'It is a catastrophic mistake which
will lead to escalation,' he said. If there is a Third World War, the
responsibility will fall on those who pushed the resolution.'
The long-debated resolution to enforce the ban, which was tabled by the UN
last October, will take effect in seven days.
To enforce the ban, the US is expected to rely on fighters from the carrier
Theodore Roosevelt - 30 F/A-18 Hornets of the US Navy and US Marine Corps
and 10 F-14 Tomcats in fighter and reconnaissance versions. The ship also
carries 14 A-6 bombers, but these would not be used under current terms of
the UN resolution, which precludes attacks on ground targets except in
self-defence.
Britain is likely to send a squadron of Tornado F3 fighters specially
assigned to 'out-of-area' operations. Currently based at Leeming in North
Yorkshire, the aircraft would operate from southern Italy. Britain also has
eight Sea Harrier fighters aboard HMS Ark Royal in the Adriatic.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, British defence procurement minister, said Britain was
'in principle' ready to contribute aircraft, but gave no details.
France was believed to be preparing to send Mirage 2000 fighters to join the
operation, although it does not belong to the alliance's military command
structure. The Netherlands has also offered to deploy a squadron of F-16
fighters.
Nato is expected to run the operation through tactical headquarters at
Vicenza in Italy. The operation will be co-ordinated by Nato AWACS
high-flying radar aircraft, already monitoring the airspace of the former
Yugoslavia.
The enforcement plan follows about 500 violations of the flying ban, mainly
by Serb helicopters. In mid-March, the UN reported that Serbs had used light
aircraft for bombing raids near the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica.
Britain and France have been reluctant to back up the no-fly ban with force,
considering that enforcement might be more trouble than it was worth.
Concern focuses on possible reprisals against UN troops, as well as the
difficulty of employing fast jets against helicopters, which can use
mountainous terrain for cover.
UN aid officials were at odds with Bosnian Serbs over help for the besieged
Moslem town of Srebrenica. The UN accused the Serbs of breaking a promise to
let food convoys reach the town. The Serbs said they would allow access only
for empty trucks to evacuate its inhabitants.

FT  02 APR 93 / EC border checks warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European commission will take legal action against EC members which fail
to remove passport controls at internal EC borders by the end of this year,
the internal market commissioner warned yesterday.
Controls on all travellers within the EC should have been lifted on January
1, 1993, according to the Commission, but a combination of political, legal
and technical obstacles prevented the 12 from meeting the deadline.
Addressing members of the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, set a new deadline of the end of
1993.
He said it would be counterproductive to take legal action against
individual member states immediately. He also said legislation alone would
be insufficient to abolish controls.
But he emphasised that Brussels would take action if member states failed to
remove passport checks at land and sea borders by July, and at airports by
December.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he had been encouraged by progress made by all 12
member states in opening borders during the first three months of this year.
The nine members of the Schengen free travel agreement are not yet satisfied
that checks at external EC frontiers are strong enough to allow internal
controls to be eased. The Schengen convention still has to be ratified by
Germany and Greece, but Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he hoped Germany at least
would ratify by early July.
The commissioner said yesterday that if there was a clear political will to
lift border controls, he would not accept technical excuses for delaying the
removal of passport checks.
He is likely to have greater difficulty persuading Britain to abandon
passport checks. The UK disputes the Commission's interpretation that
controls must be lifted on all travellers within the Community, and says the
rules apply only to EC travellers.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, who favours a non-confrontational approach, said he
had been encouraged by the gradual introduction of what he called the 'blue
wave' - a system by which EC citizens simply show the cover of their
passports at internal borders.

FT  02 APR 93 / A search for justice in east Germany's property mire: The
woes facing legislators trying to accommodate a million victims of Nazi and
Soviet confiscations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRED Kaufmann fled Nazi Germany in March 1938. He left behind in Gorlitz,
in south-eastern Germany, a textile factory that had been in the family for
two generations.
Since October 1990, Mr Kaufmann has been trying to reclaim the property.
Like many others Mr Kaufmann has presented to the local restitution office
sheafs of legal documents proving his family's entitlement to the property.
But a combination of red tape and inefficiency has prevented him from
winning it back.
His efforts have coincided with several attempts by the federal government
to come up with a law aimed at financing compensation claims and settling
the property question in eastern Germany. After more than two years of
wrangling, the cabinet presented its final draft this week.
But Mr Kaufmann is dismissive. 'It is an outrageous law because it is taking
from those whose property was taken away from them in the first place.'
The draft law is based on the terms of the unification treaty. Under it,
individuals whose property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and
between 1949 and 1990, have the legal right to seek compensation or
restitution.
Those whose property was expropriated by the Soviet occupation forces
between 1945 and 1949 will receive only limited compensation. Many of these
are 'Junkers', the large landowners in eastern Germany, who feel a deep
sense of injustice about being denied the right to restitution.
However, in an effort to attract foreign investment in eastern Germany, the
government has already passed a law that allows investors to have priority
over restitution claims. Under this law, the investor must pay the claimant
full compensation at current market value.
This, however, has not sped up investment in the five new eastern German
states because because there are vast differences of opinion about what
property is worth. Also, property developers are reluctant to invest until
they are sure there are no outstanding claims on the property.
More than 1.1m individuals have claimed title to 2.5m holdings up to
December 31 1992, the final date for doing so. Fewer than 15 per cent of the
claims have been resolved. The Berlin Federal Office for the Settlement of
Property Questions says it could take another decade to sort the rest out.
But it is not only these provisions in the law which are upsetting Mr
Kaufmann, former large land owners, and those who owned small plots of land.
What they are angry about is the way the government is seeking to finance
those seeking compensation.
The draft law states that those who get their property back must pay a tax
as a means of financing those who are compensated. The government has put
aside a compensation fund worth DM12bn, (Pounds 5bn) out of which DM3.5bn
would be raised from this form of taxation.
The complicated tax structure would be based on the 1935 land value of
property. For example, the value of a property at that time would be
multiplied by 10. From that final amount, the claimant would pay a third to
the finance ministry. Those who were able to prove that they intend to
invest in the region would, in most cases, be exempt from paying tax.
As for those seeking compensation, they would receive payment based on 1935
land valuations which would then be multiplied by a certain amount depending
on the type of property. The maximum amount of compensation paid out to any
individual would not exceed DM950,000, regardless of the size of the
property and today's value. They would be exempt from tax, but they would
not receive any compensation until after 1995.
The present bill is unlikely to please constitutional lawyers either. Mr
Hansjurgen Schafer, head of the federal office for the settlement of
property questions, said the bill would have to be referred to the
constitutional court.
'The point is that lawyers will argue that property is not being treated
equally. Why, they will ask, should those who get their property back pay
tax, while those who receive compensation for property be exempt from tax?'
But even if the constitutional court upheld the draft law, there is no
certainty that the bureaucratic and local opposition towards giving back
property to either those now living in western Germany or those forced to
emigrate before or after the Second World War will diminish.
Mr Kaufmann is willing to persist in getting his property back, or at least
obtaining official recognition that he is entitled to full compensation if
an investor chooses to buy his land: 'I am fighting for a principle and for
a right. The law says I am entitled to get my property back. I will not give
up until justice is done.'

FT  02 APR 93 / IG Metall says 100,000 strike over pay in east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of workers in eastern Germany yesterday took to the streets to
protest against the decision by steel and engineering employers not to pay
agreed increases aimed at bringing wages in the east up to western levels by
April 1994.
IG Metall, Germany's largest union, said that about 100,000 workers had
walked out, with stoppages reported in more than 220 factories in the states
of Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, as well as east Berlin.
The union is hoping the wages row will help mobilise eastern German workers
on other issues.
IG Metall, which is losing members across Germany, also wants to show it
still has political muscle.
'We have to show the employers that we will not allow them to break this
contract reached in March 1991,' said Mr Michael Bohm, spokesman for IG
Metall in Berlin. 'The employers are determined to break the tradition of
collective wage bargaining.'
The union is also concerned about living standards in the east. Easterners
pay western German prices, while wages in the region are 70 per cent of
levels in the west. This is why the union is still demanding the increases
agreed in 1991 - a 26 per cent pay increase for engineering workers and a 21
per cent rise for the steel sector. However, such pay increases do not
reflect productivity, which, on average, is 70 per cent below western German
levels. Economists fear that high labour costs in eastern Germany will drive
away investors, increase unemployment - already 18 per cent but about double
that counting those on jobless schemes - and severely undermine any hopes of
an economic upturn in the east.
A renewed round of talks last month broke off after employers tried to
negotiate for 9 per cent wage increases, which is about equivalent to
eastern Germany's expected inflation rate this year.
'Our answer is simple. Since our members are going to lose their jobs, we
might as well fight for these large pay rises so that they can have higher
unemployment benefit once they are out of work,' said Mr Bohm.
It is not certain eastern German workers feel the same: many have said they
would accept low wages in the short term, much as workers in the west are
doing, in return for jobs and investment. Both sides, and former communist
managers who were party to the wage equality contract in 1991, would
probably concede the agreement was flawed. For political reasons eastern
managers wanted high wages and the western employers were worried that lower
wages in the east would make eastern Germany more competitive. The unions
felt that higher wages in the east would help to keep wages high in western
Germany.
The economic circumstances in eastern Germany were different in 1991 too,
when it still had markets in the Soviet Union. The markets are no longer
there.

Italy's inflation in March dropped to an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent,
the lowest since spring 1987, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
According to figures from Istat, the official statistics institute, prices
in March rose only 0.2 per cent. As yet the effects of the 30 per cent
devaluation of the lira against its main trading currencies has not been
felt.

MR Alain Juppe, the new French foreign minister, has announced plans to
travel to Bonn on Monday for a meeting with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German
counterpart.
The news of the foreign ministers' meeting followed the announcement that Mr
Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, would meet Mr Helmut Kohl, the
German chancellor, in Bonn on April 22.
Mr Balladur is anxious for his administration to forge close links with the
Germans on monetary issues. He also hopes to secure Germany's support on
strategic matters, notably France's objections to the European Community's
agricultural reforms and the present EC stance on farming in the Gatt
negotiations.
Meanwhile, Mr Juppe will meet Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary
in Paris today. The meeting follows stiff protests from the UK government
about last Sunday's clash between French fishermen and a Royal Navy patrol
boat off the Channel Islands.

FT  02 APR 93 / Naples probe turns to judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Naples investigation into links between politicians, businessmen and
members of the Camorra, the local mafia, yesterday extended to embrace the
judiciary.
Two senior judges were yesterday served notice that they were under
investigation for collusion with the Camorra, while there was speculation
that a further five judges were also involved.
It is the first time such a direct accusation has been made against the
Naples judiciary, despite the long nurtured suspicion that an essential link
in the protection of the city's extensive network of organised crime was
cover from the courts.
In the past week, Palermo magistrates have also revealed they have sent
dossiers on one of Italy's best-known appeal court judges, Mr Corrado
Carnevale, to Rome. Mr Carnevale, dubbed 'the sentence killer', has presided
over a number of appeals of prominent mafiosi and found technical arguments
to reduce their sentences. New accusations may also be on the way about
Christian Democrat activities in Sicily after police seized party documents
on Wednesday.
The involvement of the judiciary in the corruption scandals threatens to
pose delicate problems. It is often the younger investigate magistrates who
are digging up evidence while the judges hearing cases in court have taken a
very restrictive view of evidence and proof, causing 75 per cent of all
prosecutions to fail.
The two judges named yesterday were Mr Armando Cono Lancuba, prosecutor
general at Melfi, 100km from Naples, who for a long time operated in the
city's courts, and Mr Alberto Lamberti, already under disciplinary
proceedings and the subject of an assassination attempt in 1982. They are
understood to have been named by Mr Pasquale Galasso, a former Camorra boss,
who is now co-operating with the authorities under a plea bargaining
programme. Mr Galasso, who looked after the business interests - valued at
L1,500bn (Pounds 684m) - of the Camorra head, Mr Carmine Alfieri, has
provided the authorities with the names of dozens of businessmen and
politicians linked to organised crime.
His confessions, combined with those of a Christian Democrat deputy, have
enabled the police to uncover the city's extensive corruption network in
under two months.
On one day alone the Naples police served 115 arrest warrants.
The significance of developments in Naples is that only here did the
Christian Democrats and Socialists hang on to their votes in the elections
of April last year.
This has been the stronghold of patronage politics.

FT  02 APR 93 / Vance's peace role offered to Norwegian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Norwegian foreign minister, is expected to take
over from Mr Cyrus Vance, the veteran former US secretary of state, as one
of the two international peace negotiators on the former Yugoslavia, though
he has yet to make a final decision whether to accept the post.
It has come as no surprise that Mr Vance, 76, is stepping down. He made it
clear at the beginning of the year that he would soon give up the arduous
task of mediator, which has required constant travel between Geneva, New
York and the former Yugoslavia and the chairing of lengthy negotiating
sessions.
Though robust in appearance, Mr Vance has been troubled by ill health and
has frequently said that he wanted to devote more time to his New York law
practice and his family. Most observers, however, expected him to wait until
a peace agreement in Bosnia was signed and sealed. That could still happen,
since Mr Stoltenberg is not due to take over from him until next month.
If he accepts the appointment, following consultations with his prime
minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, he will be joining Lord David Owen, the
European Community's representative on the two-man mediators' team. The
61-year-old Mr Stoltenberg has been offered the job as co-chairman of the
conference on the former Yugoslavia by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United
Nations secretary-general.
A Balkans expert, Mr Stoltenberg worked as a diplomat in Belgrade from 1961
to 1964, speaks Serbo-Croat and briefly held the posts of Norway's UN
representative and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
A Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali
had the backing of the five permanent members of the security council in
offering Mr Stoltenberg the post.
Though Mr Stoltenberg, coming from a small country, is not widely known as
an international statesman, the UN secretary-general clearly considers that
his considerable experience of Yugoslav problems and his familiarity with
the UN are good qualifications for the job.
Mr Vance, who has long had a close working and personal friendship with Lord
Owen, began his association with the UN at the end of 1989 and was appointed
the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia in 1991. One of his main achievements
was to have negotiated a ceasefire in January 1992 ending six months of
bitter fighting between Croats and Serbs living in the newly created
republic of Croatia.
Subsequently, he represented the UN on fact-finding missions to South Africa
and inquiries into the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and
Armenia before being appointed co-chairman of the conference on the former
Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
DON Juan de Borbon, Count of Barcelona and father of King Juan Carlos, died
in hospital in Pamplona aged 79 yesterday. Don Juan is to be buried with the
full funeral honours accorded to a reigning monarch, although he never was
one, reflecting the vital role that Don Juan played in identifying the
monarchy with the return of democracy to Spain.
It was largely because of Don Juan's lifelong defence of political pluralism
that his son, Don Juan Carlos, was able to credibly project himself after
General Franco's death as a constitutional king.
Son of King Alfonso XIII and Queen Ena of Battemberg, a grand-daughter of
Queen Victoria, Don Juan left Spain with the royal family when a republic
was proclaimed in 1931.
In 1945 Don Juan issued a manifesto calling on General Franco to step down
and setting an agenda for restoration of the monarchy and free elections.
His stand earned him the enmity of Franco who jumped the line of royal
succession and chose Don Juan Carlos, who had been educated in Spain, to
succeed him.
The tables were turned following Franco's death in 1975 when Don Juan Carlos
turned out to be his father's heir rather than the dictator's. In May 1977,
a month before the first post-Franco general elections, Don Juan moved back
to Spain and renounced his right to the throne.

FT  02 APR 93 / Japan cut in vehicle exports to EC angers industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN and the EC agreed yesterday on a 9.4 per cent cut in Japanese car and
light commercial vehicle exports to the EC in 1993, after several months of
tough but intermittent negotiations.
The accord, although meaning that Japan would ship 113,000 fewer vehicles to
the EC this year, provoked a hostile reaction from Europe's motor industry.
It was also portrayed as disappointing by the Japanese vehicle industry.
The European vehicle manufacturers' association claimed that the deal,
reached after three days of talks in Tokyo, underestimated the depth of the
decline in the new car market facing Europe this year - and left European
makers to bear this while Japanese market share increased.
It maintains that, even based on the European Commission's cautious forecast
of a 6.5 per cent fall in car sales in the Community this year, Japan's
total market share share would rise to 12.5 per cent from 11.3 per cent last
year. This includes Japanese cars produced at plants in Europe.
The agreement was based on a vaguely worded understanding, entitled
'Elements of consensus', reached two years ago between the Commission and
the Japanese government. Japan's automotive industry has maintained that it
was never bound by a formal limit. This understanding provides for an annual
consensus on the acceptable level of Japanese vehicle sales in the EC during
each year of its transition to a completely open market by the end of the
decade.
Japan yesterday agreed that exports of EC-bound cars and light commercial
vehicles should be reduced to 1.089m units from 1.202m in 1992 , based on
the expectation that EC vehicle registrations will fall this year to 13.03m
units from 13.94m in 1992.
The agreed export figure does not include vehicles made at Japanese
so-called 'transplant' factories in the EC, or Japanese exports from third
countries. Transplant sales in the EC, which reached 320,000 last year and
are expected to increase by a further 150,000 to 200,000 in 1993, were said
by the Commission to have been taken into account.
This statement is sure to cause considerable concern to the UK government
which, because of Britain's large stake in Japanese car transplant
production, was under the impression that it had secured Brussels'
acceptance that cars produced at transplants would be regarded as European.
However, the Brussels-based Association des Constructeurs Europeenes
d'Automobiles (Acea) said a market downturn of at least 10 per cent was
expected. It 'therefore expects the Commission to take full account of any
decrease beyond the agreed forecast, and to revise the total Japanese import
volume accordingly'.
In the first two months of this year, Europe's largest national market,
Germany, has been 25 per cent below year-ago levels, France 40 per cent and
Spain more than 40 per cent. The total west European market was 20.6 per
cent down. An EC official close to the talks called the agreement 'a
defensible result'.
Despite the overall drop in Japanese imports, the agreement provides for
Japanese exports to France this year to rise by 12 per cent to 77,300 units,
those to Italy by 17.5 per cent to 42,900 units, to Spain by 11 per cent to
34,200 and Portugal by 13.6 per cent to 41,500. The UK will see the biggest
rise among the five formerly protected markets, of 20 per cent to 202,800
units.

FT  02 APR 93 / Aids drug effectiveness in question: Setback for HIV
treatment after Anglo-French AZT trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIGHT against Aids received an unexpected setback yesterday when the
largest and most authoritative study of its kind showed that AZT, the
leading drug used to fight the disease, fails to delay its onset in people
who are infected with HIV.
The results of an Anglo-French trial will shock thousands of HIV-positive
people worldwide who believe that regular doses of AZT can help them.
The World Health Organisation estimates that about 10m people worldwide are
HIV-positive but not yet suffering from Aids. The trial results leave them
without any therapy proven to keep the disease at bay.
Four smaller US studies of AZT in early HIV infection had suggested that the
drug could slow down the progression to Aids.
The outcome - reported today in the medical journal, the Lancet - is also a
serious setback for Wellcome, the UK company selling AZT worldwide under the
Retrovir brand name. 'This is much the most powerful study ever carried out
with HIV-positive patients who have not yet developed symptoms of Aids,'
said Professor Ian Waller, the project's principal UK investigator.
The Anglo-French project known as Concorde, involved 1,749 patients who were
allocated at random into two groups, one taking AZT and the other a placebo
(dummy) pill. They were followed for an average of three years. Survival
rates in the two groups were almost the same; 8 per cent of those taking AZT
and 7 per cent of those on placebo had died after three years. And there was
no significant difference in progression to Aids.
'These results do not encourage early use of AZT in asymptomatic
HIV-infected individuals,' says the UK Medical Research Council, which
organised Concorde jointly with France's National Aids Research Agency.
Wellcome hoped to expand sales of Retrovir - worth Pounds 131m in the six
months to February 1993 - by marketing the drug to asymptomatic patients.
The latest finding does not affect the view that AZT can prolong the life of
HIV-positive patients who have gone on to develop Aids.
Wellcome estimates about 38 per cent of US patients using AZT - its second
best-selling product - are asymptomatic. The company reckons between 125,000
and 150,000 Americans use the drug.
'A 38 per cent collapse in sales would be the disaster scenario. We do not
think the trial has implications for clinical management,' said Wellcome.
'Using AZT on its own is old science. Doctors are moving to combination
therapy (using AZT with other drugs).'
Wellcome argues that Concorde's conclusions are not as stark as they appear.
It points out that the procedure was changed in the middle of the trial to
allow placebo patients whose condition was deteriorating to take AZT. It
believes that this 'diluted' the difference between the groups.
But the company and the Concorde investigators agree that the future lies
with cocktails of anti-HIV drugs rather than 'monotherapy' - using a single
drug such as AZT.
Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the
leading UK Aids charity, called the Concorde result 'very depressing for
people who are well and taking AZT. It is clear that we are many years away
from adequate treatments'.

FT  02 APR 93 / Royal Mail monopoly may be abolished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL'S monopoly on delivering letters may be abolished under
government plans to sell the Post Office.
Proposals under ministerial consideration would allow private companies to
compete with Royal Mail for the delivery of all letters, provided they
matched Royal Mail's commitment to providing a nationwide service at a
uniform price.
This would be part of a strategy to inject competition into all areas of the
Post Office's business. Royal Mail has a monopoly on all deliveries costing
up to Pounds 1.
Ministers are thought to be keen to avoid the charge that the sale of the
Post Office would amount to the mere transfer of a long-standing monopoly
from the public to the private sector.
Last year's Conservative manifesto committed the party to setting up an
independent regulator to advise on the 'progressive introduction of
competition'. It also promised to lower the limit on the Post Office
monopoly much closer to the price of a first-class stamp - currently 24p -
and to consider requests to 'license limited specialist services to compete
within the Post Office monopoly'.
The government is in the final stages of deciding whether to plump for the
sale of all three Post Office units - Royal Mail, Post Office Counters and
Parcelforce - and is expected to make up its mind soon after Easter.
If full-fledged privatisation is chosen, government business managers would
have to decide whether to make room for the bill in the legislative
timetable for the next parliamentary session beginning in October.
After recent problems subduing backbench revolts on Maastricht and pit
closures, business managers are believed to be anxious for the bulk of next
session's legislative proposals to be either non-controversial or calculated
to unite Tory ranks. It is not certain that a Post Office privatisation bill
would fall into either of these categories.
The current preference in the Department of Trade and Industry would be for
the government to take powers to sell all three arms of the Post Office, but
for the actual sales to take place in at least two stages.
Under present thinking, Royal Mail and the loss-making Parcelforce parcel
delivery business could be floated off in a single unit relatively quickly.
But the management of Post Office Counters would probably remain in the
public sector for longer while a strategy was devised for branching out
beyond the restricted range of products the organisation is permitted to
sell. Financial services is thought to be one area ministers would be keen
for Counters to develop. The government will also need to reassure Tory
backbenchers in rural constituencies that any sale would not result in a
severe contraction of Counters' 20,000-strong network of post offices, which
is the largest chain of retail outlets in the country.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced in July that
he intended to sell Parcelforce as a separate unit. But these plans have
since run into difficulties.
Unlike other privatisation candidates, the Post Office is hugely profitable,
having doubled pre-tax profits for the six months to last September to
Pounds 135m on turnover of Pounds 2.5bn. Over the same period, Parcelforce
reduced its losses from Pounds 27m to Pounds 21m.
Any move to take powers to privatise all parts of the Post Office would
probably be welcomed by senior management which has lobbied hard for the
organisation to be kept together.
Private mail operators expressed doubts about the scheme. Mr Alan Jones, UK
managing director of the leading operator TNT, said: 'We couldn't get
involved if it was an open market. That would be ridiculous. If you've got a
dozen postmen walking down the same street, the costs go up and so does the
price to the customer.'

FT  02 APR 93 / Stock Exchange to delay USM closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday bowed to pressure from companies,
financial advisers and investors to delay the closure of the unlisted
securities market until alternatives had been investigated.
The exchange, announcing its decision after a three-month consultation
period, said the USM would remain open to new entrants until the end of
1994. Companies would not have to move to the main market before the end of
1996, when European directives making the transition much cheaper are
expected to be in place.
Mr Martin Hall, the exchange's head of public affairs, said: 'There was a
strong feeling it would have sent the wrong signal to close the USM without
having a successor in place or thoroughly pursuing the debate.'
The exchange also announced the creation of a working party to investigate
'the future capital raising needs of companies which are outside the scope
of the Official List'.
The number of companies which fall outside the listing requirements is
likely to be relatively small, however. Current minimum requirements are a
market capitalisation of Pounds 700,000, a three-year trading record, and
the issue of at least 25 per cent of the company's shares.
Mr Hall suggested that the investigation might discover 'there are types of
companies which the stock exchange has never catered for'. The working party
would not be restricted to investigating options which only the exchange
could implement.
Its primary task would be to determine whether there would indeed be an
equity gap for smaller companies following the USM's closure. It would also
tackle issues such as the creation of a market aimed at professional
investors, which might enjoy a lower degree of regulation than one for the
public in general.
The party will be made up of representatives from companies, investors and
financial advisers. Cisco, the City lobby group for smaller company
interests, will be invited to take part, as will representatives of venture
capital organisations. Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco,
welcomed the announcement.

Hungarian wholesaler of agricultural machinery and chemicals, writes
Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Getz, a subsidiary of the Pritzkers' diversified Marmon Group, took an 82.9
per cent stake in Agroker for an undisclosed sum.
Getz, whose activity has centred on east Asia, said it planned to expand
into both eastern and western Europe from a base in Hungary.
Yesterday's acquisition complements Getz's earlier purchase of
Intercooperation, a Hungarian trading company.
That transaction, made in 1989, is believed to have been the first outright
western acquisition of an eastern European state company.

JACOBS SUCHARD, the Swiss confectionery group owned by Philip Morris, has
agreed to pay Dollars 5m for an 80 per cent share in the Olza factory, a
chocolate wafer producer in southern Poland, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw.
The agreement, signed yesterday, includes a commitment for immediate
investments in the plant worth Dollars 11.3m and to spend a further Dollars
15m at a later date.
Olza's had sales last year of Dollars 24m, of which 15 per cent was
exported. The purchase is Jacobs Suchard's first investment in Poland after
it had a factory it owned in Krakow nationalised in the 1940s.
The company has, however, been marketing its coffee and chocolate products
there for the past two years. The disposal comes as a question mark
continues to hang over Philip Morris's efforts to purchase the Krakow
tobacco factory in a deal which could be worth in excess of Dollars 400m.
Philip Morris has had its Marlboro cigarettes made in Krakow under a
co-operation agreement since the early 1970s. Recently, the Sejm, (upper
house of parliament) passed a resolution calling on the government to
maintain a state monopoly in the tobacco and alcohol sectors. However, the
privatisation ministry is still hoping to get the resolution reinterpreted
to allow the purchase to go ahead.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (15): Ambitious agenda for new team -
Oil's longstanding problems are being tackled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENERGY sector is in need of an overhaul, and the new ministerial team
led by Chief Philip Asiodu is determined to get the process under way in the
short period at their disposal.
Mr Asiodu, one of the leading technocrats on the transitional council, is
the secretary for petroleum resources, and is highly regarded in the oil
business. He has been associated with the industry for three decades, and
has begun to tackle problems which, in the words of one oil man, 'have been
holding back the industry for years'.
Mr Asiodu and his colleagues are scheduled to hold office only until August,
but he has nevertheless set an ambitious agenda. By then he aims to sign up
foreign oil companies to develop new fields, get the multi-billion liquefied
natural gas project off the ground after three decades of false starts,
introduce sustainable domestic fuel prices, and free up the downstream and
distribution sectors to foreign and private sector investment.
If he achieves most of these aims, or commits the succeeding government to
achieving them, 1993 will have been a turning point for the oil industry.
Nigeria's budgeted oil revenue this year is Dollars 6.3bn, which is 80 per
cent of the country's foreign currency earnings; but it sells fewer barrels
of oil than it did in 1980, when the price was more than 50 per cent higher.
Nigeria is even richer in gas than in oil, yet this resource has yet to be
adequately tapped. The reasons include: inappropriate state regulation to
limits on the percentage that foreign investors can hold in oil companies;
downstream investment obstacles, such as loss-making domestic petroleum
prices; and an inefficient local distribution system.
One of these factors - the structure of the ownership of the oil industry -
is putting a strain on the funding of production and exploration.
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds a majority stake in all
the joint ventures that produce oil (which in March was just under 1.8m b/d.
Yet NNPC - whose contribution to production and exploration should be
proportionate to its equity stake - has said it intends to increase
productive capacity from the present level of 2m b/d to 2.5m b/d by the
mid-1990s, so that it can increase its Opec quota, assuming the market picks
up.
Nigeria's proven oil reserves are approximately 20bn barrels, but the
majority of the oil fields are small and have wells producing between 500
and 5,000 b/d. Around two-thirds of Nigeria's production is onshore, mostly
in the swamps of the Niger Delta, and all offshore fields are in shallow
water.
The next major area for exploration is in deep water concessions, as much as
4,000 feet deep. 'That is frontier territory,' says Jim Massey, Mobil's
exploration and production director in Nigeria. 'Not much of the world's oil
production is even at 2,000 feet deep.
'Under the production-sharing agreement, we would be purely a contractor
with no equity. When we found oil we would recover our costs and then split
the profits with NNPC on a sliding scale.'
Mobil, like the other oil majors, stresses the importance of the Memorandum
of Understanding, which in 1986 underwrote profitability for NNPC's equity
partners at Dollars 2 a barrel, at a time when oil prices were very low.
The agreement was amended to allow Dollars 2.5 a barrel, subject to
sufficient investment, but provides no scope for extra reward based on high
efficiency when the oil price is more buoyant. The draft production-sharing
contract does provide such incentives, but forces the international oil
companies to bear all the risk.
Ashland of the US already has such a contract, but since 1991 a number of
big oil companies have been negotiating for rewards to justify the cost of
working in deep water.
Among those interested in deep-water blocks is BP, in partnership with
Statoil, ending an 11-year absence following nationalisation of its assets.
Questioned about production sharing, Mr Asiodu replied: 'Once you have
reached a taxation regime of over 80 per cent, the theoretical ownership of
60 per cent of the equity, as opposed to having a contractor working for
you, brings minimal extra benefit', he said prior to issuing a third draft
of the terms. 'So exploration sharing is better for us because we can save
what little money we have for more pressing needs.'
Among pressing needs is the improvement of efficiency in the downstream
sector. Although NNPC has four domestic refineries with an installed
capacity of over 400,000 b/d, one has been out of action since it caught
fire in 1989, and the sector is running at about 50 per cent of capacity.
Mismanagement and lack of funding due to very low domestic fuel prices have
led to a crumbling distribution system and petrol shortages. Corruption and
smuggling into neighbouring Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, where domestic
fuel prices are about ten and 20 times higher, has exacerbated the problem.
The Transitional Council believes the solution lies in lifting the fuel
price subsidies. On March 15, it reduced subsidies on non-conventionals -
that is base oils, lubricant oils, paraffin wax and aviation fuel. These
measures, and a three-month campaign explaining to the public the arguments
against the fuel price subsidy, are in preparation for the raising of the
price of petrol and diesel, with the inevitable inflationary effect and the
threat of riots in response.
Privatisation of downstream assets is unlikely to bring the same enthusiasm
from the big oil companies as the sale of NNPC's upstream equity, but if
fuel prices are raised substantially, the way could be open for new
investment to transform the marketing and distribution of petroleum
products.
Publication of guidelines and incentives for investment in gas-related and
petrochemicals products is imminent. The government is forced to meet the
rising cost of the Eleme petrochemicals plant, which plans to start
exporting polyethylene and polypropylene early in 1994.
At the same time, it has to fund Nafcon 2, the next fertiliser plant, the
LNG project, and the gas-gathering venture with Chevron to produce Liquefied
Petroleum Gas at Escravos.

1992 from DKr643m in 1991.
A DKr154m write-off for loans to the Hafnia Holding insurance group
contributed to the downturn. Group sales were down, to DKr12.08bn from
DKr12.49bn, and profits after net financial items fell to DKr365m from
DKr673m. An unchanged DKr12-a-share dividend was proposed.
The group, which makes about 80 per cent of its sales outside Denmark, said
difficult world trading conditions and the strength of the Danish currency
hit performance.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Stefanel to suspend dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing company, plans to suspend its dividend
following a collapse in profits owing to the recession.
Group net earnings dropped to L24.1bn (Dollars 15.2m) last year from
L37.1bn, in spite of a 7.3 per cent rise in sales to L468.6bn. The pressure
on earnings was seen most severely at parent company level, where net
profits plunged to L600m against L13.8bn in 1991 as a result of losses at
some unspecified subsidiaries.
The earnings drop, examined by Stefanel's board yesterday, has triggered the
decision to suspend the dividend on the grounds that the company needs to
reinforce internal resources and consolidate its finances for future growth.
Last year, Stefanel made a payout of L140 a share, unchanged from 1990.
The reduction in earnings at group level comes partly on account of a big
increase in provisions to L34.5bn against L25.4bn in 1991 as a result of the
recession. Moreover, profits in 1991 were lifted by L11bn in extraordinary
items. At the operating level, group profits remained virtually unchanged at
L51.6bn compared with L51.2bn in 1991.
Results at Stefanel, one of Italy's best-known retailers, contrasts with
Benetton's upbeat figures earlier this week. Benetton, its bigger neighbour
in the Veneto region, raised net earnings by 12.1 per cent to L184.7bn and
its dividend to L350 a share.

FT  01 APR 93 / IADB to play wider role in Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE InterAmerican Development Bank closed its annual meeting in Hamburg
yesterday with every prospect of an expanded role in Latin America during
the 1990s.
Government shareholders from the Americas and outside the region gave broad
support to a rise in the bank's capital. A Dollars 22.5bn increase in
capital agreed in 1989 runs out at the end of this year, and negotiations
are expected over the rest of this year about a further increase.
Yet it was also clear that the IADB's role is expected to change. It is
likely to focus more on the private sector following privatisation in much
of Latin America and governments' increased reliance on the private sector
for infrastructure development. The bank does not lend directly to the
private sector at present.
Some shareholders suggested that 5-10 per cent of its capital should be
devoted to private sector infrastructure lending. In total, about half of
its lending will go on infrastructure, the quality of which deteriorated
badly in the 1980s.
Further effort by the bank in social sectors was called for, notably poverty
alleviation, health and education. The US also urged the bank to help moves
towards 'good government', such as improving the judicial system.
According to Mr Enrique Iglesias, IADB president, discussion about a capital
increase centred on a figure of Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn. This would allow
the bank to continue to lend at the current Dollars 7bn-a-year rate.
Talks on capital replenishment resume in May in Montevideo, when the thorny
issue of increasing the shareholding of the bank's government shareholders
from outside the region will first be confronted. An increased non-regional
share means the US will have to cut its stake in the bank, something it has
strongly opposed.
The Peruvian minister of finance, Mr Jorge Camet, said talks with commercial
banks expected to begin in June over a debt restructuring would explore ways
of using foreign debt as a means of payment for the privatisation of large
state-owned assets. The government expected to privatise some 40 companies
of this year, he said.

A VIETNAMESE court has jailed eight anti-government intellectuals for up to
20 years after a two-day trial, ending a case that has aroused concern in
the west, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
They pleaded guilty to 'activities aimed at overthrowing the government,'
the official Vietnam news agency (VNA) said.
The people's court in Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday sentenced Mr Doan Viet
Hoat to 20 years in prison. Two chief associates were jailed for 16 and 12
years. Five others convicted of belonging to an organisation called Freedom
Forum were jailed for between eight months and seven years.

<TEXT>
SOUTH African troops and police ringed a pro-ANC black homeland yesterday in
a show of force before South Africa's second attempt to launch multi-party
talks on a transition from white rule to democracy, Reuter reports from Cape
Town.
Mr Craig Kotze, a police spokesman, said more than 1,000 police and an
undisclosed number of soldiers threw a cordon around the south-coast
Transkei homeland. 'We have to stop attacks on civilians by APLA (Azanian
People's Liberation Army) members from Transkei,' he said. APLA is the
military wing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), one of
26 groups scheduled to meet the government in Johannesburg today and
tomorrow for the first substantive democracy talks in more than 10 months.
A PAC spokesman said APLA would continue its armed struggle. The government
has accused Transkei of harbouring APLA guerrillas, which it blames for a
series of recent attacks on whites.
Mr Romero Daniels, APLA political commissar, denied the group was attacking
white civilians but said it regarded police and security forces as
legitimate targets.
Major-General Bantu Holomisa, the Transkei's military ruler who has accused
white military and political chiefs of planning coups and assassinations
against homeland leaders, said he would meet President F W de Klerk today to
discuss the crisis.
Government and ANC officials expected a stormy start to the second attempt
for a political settlement but added that both sides were committed to
success.
'We cannot afford to have these talks break down. We have to go for broke
this time,' said one government official.
Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, conservative leader of the Inkatha Freedom party,
was expected to make a strong pitch for an immediate commitment to
federalism.
The PAC and Mr Nelson Mandela's ANC said control of the army would top the
agenda at the opening session.
Government officials said they wanted to talk first about violence,
including the murder of 10 whites, two of them children, since December and
dismantling guerrilla armies.
The peace process stalled last May in a dispute about regional powers and
the state's role in black township violence.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parties reveal L27bn gap in funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gap between what Italy's political parties said they received in revenue
and what they said they spent quadrupled last year to L27bn (Dollars 17m).
According to the parties' balance sheets published yesterday, just a week
after their 1991 accounts, revenues totalled L279.4bn while outgoings were
L306bn.
The accounts have been prepared amid the year-long magistrates'
investigations into illicit party funding, but still fail to reflect the
true picture.
The investigations, which have involved more than 70 members of parliament
and forced the leaders of five parties to resign, have shown that for last
April's elections substantial sums were paid on the side - and these went
either to cover party expenses or for personal enrichment.
A comment by the small Radical party attached to its balance sheet reads:
'One should not believe the accounts published by the parties because they
are false.'

EC AMBASSADORS yesterday voted unanimously to accept television cameras into
three EC ministerial debates next Monday and Tuesday in Luxembourg.
Their vote follows the vetoing of three requests earlier this month by the
current Danish presidency of the EC, for the broadcast of debates on global
warming, transport policy, and the common fisheries policy. Belgium,
Luxembourg and Portugal were the main objectors.
Monday's and Tuesday's televised debates will cover the opening of
negotiations on Norway's entry to the EC; how to make the internal market
work, and the role of trade unions and employers in shaping a strategy to
create jobs.
Denmark is fighting hard to demonstrate to its own people that the EC is
opening up its secretive decision-making to public scrutiny, in a bid to
sway Danes who voted against Maastricht last June to endorse it in a second
referendum due on May 18.
The Commission also distanced itself from a public relations report,
commissioned after the Edinburgh summit and published yesterday, which calls
for the centralisation of EC information policy.

FT  01 APR 93 / Bitter pill from company doctors: Restructuring at
Volkswagen is a radical response to the 'emergency' at the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An emergency team has moved into Volkswagen and is dishing out bitter
medicine in equal measure all round.
The group's employees, shareholders and top management have all been
subjected to a stiff dose in the three months since Mr Ferdinand Piech took
over as chairman. The aim is to find a cure and put group earnings back on
the path to growth by next year, according to Mr Piech.
Volkswagen, which encompasses the VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques, is
Europe's biggest car maker with annual turnover equivalent to about 3 per
cent of unified Germany's economic output. The symptoms of the group's
malaise, detectable in less acute forms elsewhere in German industry,
include concentrating on turnover and employing large numbers of workers at
the expense of costs and profitability.
Proclaming an 'emergency', Mr Piech yesterday revealed at the company's
annual press conference that Volkswagen had plunged into a DM1.25bn (Pounds
520m) loss in the first three months of this year. The share price reacted
sharply, closing DM8 down at DM304 1/2 . The underlying seriousness of the
situation had already been exposed two weeks ago when the group reported an
87 per cent collapse in after-tax profits last year to DM147m - all earned
on the supply of spares - and record turnover of DM85.4bn from peak sales of
3.5m vehicles.
Mr Piech drafted his restructuring programme within days of arrival. Some
36,000 jobs were earmarked to go by the end of 1997. His announcement
yesterday that 20,000 would be cut this year alone, mostly in Germany,
underlined his determination to curb spiralling wage costs. Capital
investments for this year have been throttled back by about half, to DM6bn.
The first victim of the spending cuts will be plans to expand capacity. 'I
believe a lot more can be squeezed out of existing plants without the need
for great investments,' Mr Piech said. The development of a new factory in
Mosel, eastern Germany, which observers consider superfluous in the
slow-growing European market, has already been delayed.
Guided by their charismatic company doctor, grandson of the legendary Mr
Ferdinand Porsche who developed the VW Beetle, the group's supervisory board
(which oversees policymaking and management) agreed to hack the 1992
dividend from DM11 to DM2 and remove three management board directors,
including the finance director, last month.
And now the therapy is to be shared more widely - among 1,500 suppliers -
following the hijacking of the idiosyncratic arch-motivator Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors in Detroit.
Mr Lopez, the group's new purchasing director, dubbed 'The Merciless', is
armed with a reputation worthy of his nickname and a mystique worthy of a
tribal medicine man. Within days of his recent appointment he was at work
searching for economies in the group's estimated DM50bn annual bill for
bought-in components and services.
In an attack on the over-engineering pinpointed by others as a prime failing
of German industry, he ordered that the present 16 rear-axle variants for
the VW Golf should be reduced to four. He proclaimed that in future the
company would concern itself with 'core' competences in engine blocks, gear
boxes, bodywork and painting. The rest would be left to outside suppliers,
which would be cut to fewer than 200. They would be required to supply
standardised modular components - complete brakes units comprising pedal,
discs and anti-lock electronics, for example - which could be installed in
the greatest possible number of models.
The arrival of Mr Lopez, seen as one of Volkswagen's greatest management
assets, has rattled the suppliers, which currently provide about 65 per cent
of components to the group worldwide and about half that level in Germany.
Mr Piech tried to soothe their fears yesterday, claiming that price cuts
would be made on a co-operative basis. 'If a supplier does not think he is
able to manage, our people will go in and help,' he promised. 'We can only
survive together in symbiosis.' While he would not say precisely how far
procurement costs must fall, the price cuts had to be as big as possible
'without causing our suppliers to go under'.
Confirming his reputation in the automotive industry as a leader, Mr Lopez
last week delivered six of his senior GM buying-team members - his
'warriors' as he calls them - to Mr Piech. One, Mr Jose Gutierrez,
immediately replaced the procurement director for the VW marque.
This move underlines Mr Piech's determination to shake up and rebuild the
cosy relationships between the company and its suppliers and at the same
time revitalise its congested hierarchy with outside senior managers.
Continuing the reshuffle on Tuesday, the director responsible for worldwide
distribution of the VW brand, and the president of Volkswagen of America,
were abruptly replaced.
'Within the group there are basically 200 to 300 people who are absolutely
indispensable for our survival,' Mr Piech said recently. There was a huge
mass of people in group administration who now had to ask themselves what
they did to earn their keep, he remarked.
'I have always paid more to those people who did not see it as their
business to build up hierarchies than to those who built up substructures in
order to push themselves one step higher.' Work is now under way to reduce
the current nine management levels to three, Mr Piech said yesterday.
The restorative action being undertaken has been widely welcomed. But while
investors have tended to view the dividend cut as their contribution to
overall belt-tightening, the loss announcement reinforced scepticism at the
management's claim that the group would break even by the end of the year.
Amid such apprehension it is easy to lose sight of the strengths
underpinning Mr Piech's faith that the 1990s would be a decade of profit.
Thanks to his grandfather, the Volkswagen name is one of the best-known car
marques in the world. Despite the domestic slump and slow sales in Europe
overall, its market share of close to 17 per cent still dominates its
rivals. Thanks to Mr Carl Hahn, who led the group's international expansion
during the 1980s, Volkswagen is also less dependent than most of its
European competitors on the west European market, where estimated long-term
growth of up to 3 per cent a year must increasingly be shared with the
encroaching Japanese.
Although the group's US market share has collapsed to about 1 per cent,
other overseas investments are performing strongly. Its plant in Mexico
helps supply a 32 per cent share of the local market, and forms the likely
launch-pad for a renewed assault on the US. China, where the group's first
factory increased output by 86 per cent to 65,000 units last year, is
forecast to become the group's third-biggest market after Germany and Italy
by 1996. Skoda, the Czech republic affiliate, reported an 18.5 per cent
increase in deliveries in January and February this year over the same 1992
period.
However, many underlying problems remain. As one industry observer notes:
'VW is a classic case of a company that has made too extreme a sacrifice in
short-term profitability for future growth.' The price is now being paid
mainly at home in Germany. By sharing the pain among all involved and
setting clear targets, Mr Piech has acted according to the international
book of good corporate housekeeping. But he has also launched a violent
assault on the stifling management and industrial practices common to German
industry. The restructuring programme, unprecedented in scope and vigour, is
at odds with German management's ingrained softly-softly approach to radical
change.
It is no accident that the front-line team picked to drive it through is
entirely foreign. Mr Lopez is a Basque, and Mr Daniel Goeudevert, main board
director responsible for the flagship VW brand, is French. Mr Piech is an
Austrian, although his old-fashioned sense of duty and commitment has earned
him the sobriquet of 'The Last Prussian'. By selecting outsiders to resolve
the crisis, the supervisory board has sent the clearest possible signal that
it believes traditional German management is not up to the job of steering
Volkswagen away from the brink of disaster.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (23): A leap from farm to finance - A day
in the life of a young professional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOSEPH TAYANWA arose from his bed at 5am and did what many Nigerians are now
accustomed to do: he switched on CNN. The Lagos press has complained that
CNN, which is broadcast free of charge during weekday mornings, represents
the insidious face of 'cultural imperialism'. But to Joseph Tayanwa it was
merely a way of keeping in touch.
As CNN burbled, Joseph, a Lagos bank clerk, shuffled around his tiny room.
Against one wall was jammed a shelving unit - home to a television set,
video and stereo, as well as books, knick-knacks and pots and pans.
A few paces away, a bed was pushed up against the wall. Between the two,
which marked the extent of Joseph's home, was a coffee table and two chairs.
The room was neat, but an exceptionally humble place for a young
professional to live in. It was also pervaded by an unmistakable stench from
the open gutters which lined the streets outside.
Joseph, now 30, has done well for himself. Thanks to the generosity of his
uncle, who supported him through secondary school, he made the transition
from village to city and from his father's life as a peasant farmer to his
own as a bank clerk with managerial aspirations. His leap from farm to
finance, from traditional to modern, typifies the mobility of Nigerian
society which fosters an American-like desire for personal success. But
Joseph's life, conducted against the backdrop of a city with poor housing,
inadequate sanitation and chronic transport problems, also highlights the
difficulty urban Nigeria has in meeting the needs of its evolving
population.
Joseph opened the door and fumbled his way along the dank passageway to the
back of the compound. In a stall, he washed himself with a bucket of water
filled from a standpipe in the courtyard.
Passing the room next to his own - home to a family of four - he bought a
small white loaf from a woman who had set up shop on his doorstep. Back in
his room, he ate thick slices of bread smeared with margarine, and drank
sweet tea.
After breakfast he pulled on a jacket and tie and ran a brush over his shoes
to remove the red dust of Lagos. It was important, he said, to look smart
for the office.
Joseph works at Chartered Bank as an assistant supervisor. Above him in the
hierarchy are supervisors, officers, assistant managers and the manager. He
earns nearly N4,000 a month, a little above Pounds 100 at current exchange
rates. He pays N500 for his lodging, which includes use of a parlour at the
back of the compound. He could probably afford a nicer place, but
accommodation is hard to find and he has other financial commitments.
Since his father died, Joseph - the eldest son - sends N500 a month to his
mother. His six siblings also need support. Whatever is left over, Joseph
saves. He plans to marry a girl he met in Kaduna, but cannot afford to do so
until the end of next year.
At 6.30am Joseph left the compound and made his way through the dusty
streets. His journey to the office, on Chartered Bank's staff bus, takes no
more than 40 minutes. He is lucky. It is not unusual for Lagosians to spend
three or four hours battling their way to work.
The bus crossed swiftly from the mainland to Ikoyi, an island at the smarter
end of town. It pulled up in front of the bank in Awolowo road and Joseph
made his way to the accounts and reconciliation department. The neat,
air-conditioned offices contrasted with the grime, dust and oppressive heat
outside. Joseph sat quietly, going over yesterday's transactions.
When the power went off, as it frequently does in Lagos, the generator
kicked into action. After taking his lunch break - though he ate no lunch -
Joseph poured over the accounts once more. He said he enjoyed the discipline
of balancing credits and debits.
He left the office at 6.45pm, a little earlier than usual, in order to
attend the service at the Deeper Life Bible Church. Much of the ordered
manner with which Joseph conducts his life derives from his Christian faith.
Because the staff bus had already left, Joseph hailed a little mini-van
crammed with passengers. He passed a single naira to the conductor - a
skinny boy leaning precariously out of the door, chanting the bus route to
passers-by. As the van trundled along, the roads became more rutted and the
vehicle zigzagged to avoid potholes. Each change of gear was accompanied by
a sound like the yelp of a puppy. The sun had set, but the air remained
chokingly hot, thick with petrol and perspiration.
After briefly breaking down, the van resumed its journey, threading its way
through the late evening traffic. At busy periods, Lagos roads grind to a
complete standstill, notwithstanding the fact that only half the city's
vehicles are allowed on the streets at any given time - odd number licence
plates one day, even numbers the next.
At Obalende, Joseph struggled off the van and picked his way past the press
of hawkers. Kerosene bush lamps flickered in the darkness. The next leg of
his journey was by molue, yellow buses so poorly maintained that they have
been dubbed 'moving coffins.' (In February a packed molue caught fire on the
Third Mainland bridge, leaving 25 people burnt beyond recognition.)
The molue lurched to a start, stopping every few seconds to pick up
passengers who crowded on to the narrow wooden seats. On the expressway it
picked up speed, causing the engine to rattle like a food processor. The
smell of burnt rubber floated through the dark interior.
At Oyigbo Joseph caught a van, much like the first, which dropped him off in
his neighbourhood, Ebute Metta. The hour's journey, on three vehicles, had
cost him N5 and a deal of perspiration. There were no street lights, and
crossing the gutters over narrow wooden planks required some skill.
The church service he had travelled to, held in a tin-roofed barn, had
already begun. Hundreds of people sat on benches listening to a sermon
delivered over a tinny microphone. After a while Joseph joined the
congregation in prayer, asking that barren women be blessed with children.
Many people went into a trance, clicking their fingers and rolling their
eyes.
The service ended at 9pm. Joseph, who had not eaten since early morning,
made his way home. Outside his compound a marquee had been set up; a crowd
had gathered for the funeral wake of a local resident. Women were singing,
their voices mingling with the evening hubbub of the crowded streets.
Joseph bought a piece of cold chicken from a roadside stall. Most nights he
buys pounded yam, or eba, a doughy substance made from cassava. Reaching
home, he ate the chicken and watched the evening news.
At 11pm, Joseph hung his clothes on a rack at the foot of his bed. It had
been a long day, but no longer than most. As he fell asleep, the sound of
singing and drumming drifted through the window. In six hours it would be
time to start again.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (24): A nettle to grasp - The domestic
price of petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE paid by Nigerians for petrol at the pump is perhaps the most
important indicator of the transitional council's ability to force through
necessary but politically unpopular reforms.
Fuel prices are absurdly low. Nigerian petrol prices are equivalent to
Dollars 6.2 per barrel, compared with an OECD average of Dollars 114.1 and
an OPEC country average of Dollars 27. Drivers in Lagos can fill their tanks
for N0.7 (3 US cents) a litre.
Motorists in the north, however, regularly pay high prices from black market
vendors because pumps have run dry. The reason is that speculators buy fuel
to smuggle to neighbouring countries for huge profit. With comparative pump
prices per litre of N9.72 in Benin, N10.93 in Cameroon, N14.61 in Niger and
N16.11 in Chad, it is a lucrative business.
While cheap domestic fuel is filling the pockets of smugglers, it is also
leaving a gaping hole in Nigeria's federal budget. The gap has grown in
recent years as petrol prices have failed to keep pace with inflation. The
pump price has increased by 77 per cent between 1987 and 1992 but, in real
terms, this amounted to an 85 per cent decline.
According to an internal report from state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Company (NNPC), the government allocates 300,000 barrels a day of crude for
domestic processing at a cost of N20 a barrel.
At less than Dollars 1 at current exchange rates, this is far below the
Dollars 6.5 a barrel that NNPC needs to cover the technical costs of
production. It also compares with an international price of nearly Dollars
20 a barrel, representing an annual loss to the government of N41bn. The
lost revenue would cover nine-tenths of last year's budget deficit.
This is not the only loss to the state. The total cost to NNPC of
processing, refining and transporting crude is N21.3bn. NNPC, however,
receives only N4.7bn at the regulated supply price, while the margins of
downstream retailers are depressed. The result, according to the NNPC
report, is that: 'The entire downstream petroleum industry is well advanced
in a process of decapitalisation and decay as participants suffer a whopping
deficit of N59.41bn a year, equivalent to Dollars 27.1 per barrel.'
NNPC estimates that to eliminate the N59.4bn revenue shortfall would require
a rise in domestic petrol prices to N9.9 per litre, an increase of more than
1,300 per cent. World Bank officials believe that an increase to about N5
per litre would eliminate much of the distortion.
The government recently raised the price of airline fuel by 400 per cent to
N5.5 (22 cents) a litre, limiting the increase in domestic air fares to 200
per cent.
But the nettle yet to be grasped is the raising of petrol prices. The
transitional council has set up an independent monitoring body to help
ensure that extra revenue would be properly spent and not find its way into
the pockets of government officials. It may prove difficult, though, to
convince a sceptical Nigerian public.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (25): Wild colonial boys
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Joachim (Joe) Brandler recalls life in Lagos nearly 50 ago . . .
AT THE time of my arrival in 1947 the atmosphere in Lagos was still very
colonial. The administration was totally in the hands of the Colonial
Office, and so were the various bodies answerable to Government, be it
Customs, Health, Police, Army, Ports, Law, Education and so on All had white
officers at their head - and in key positions.
There were still white locomotive drivers working on the railways; a rough
lot who let their hair down in these foreign parts and the Railway Club in
Ebute Metta was renowned for its wild scenes.
We all walked about in shorts and open-necked shirts during the daytime; in
the evening one wore long trousers, long sleeved shirts and tie. A tie was
also worn with shorts if one had to call on a Government officer. Every
expat slept under a mosquito net and many boiled their water and then
filtered it.
It was rare for whites and blacks to mix socially.
The British had to ensure that they were feared and respected and undue
intimacy would mitigate against that.
Air-conditioning did not come in until the 1950s. Social life was active,
with sporting clubs and private dinner parties within fairly narrow circles.
One of the highlights was the Queen's visit in 1956. It started off in
Lagos, where the streets had been gaily decorated and schoolchildren lined
the roads waving little Union Jacks. From Lagos the Royal party went
up-country. It was impossible then to imagine that in a few years Nigeria
would declare herself an independent republic, albeit within the
Commonwealth. There was not a single hostile demonstration during the whole
visit.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (22): Doubts about local processing -
Cocoa producers fear a ban or levy on the export of beans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most striking indications of the impact of economic reform on the
agricultural sector is the surge in cocoa production.
The latest estimates put the 1992-3 crop at 135,000 tonnes, which even at
today's depressed prices will earn over Dollars 90m, making the commodity
the country's largest source of non-oil export earnings.
It is nearly twice the level of 1986, the first year of the structural
adjustment programme which aimed to reduce dependence on oil wealth and
boost agriculture.
Despite the falling prices on the world market, prices paid in naira to
Nigerian farmers have increased in recent months, as the crop has become a
valuable source of scarce foreign currency and a hedge against devaluation
of the naira.
What concerns producers and exporters, however, is the prospect of a ban or
a levy on the export of beans, intended to encourage local processing of the
beans and add value to the exported product.
Early this year, the government denied that it would impose the export ban,
first slated for January 1991; and the anticipated levy of Dollars 250 on
exported raw beans did not feature in January's 1993 budget. But the issue
has been prominent for four years now, and few people in the business
believe that they have heard the last of it.
The argument for banning or penalising the export of raw cocoa, and
encouraging local processing of cocoa butter, liquor, cake and powder, is
that adding value to a raw material export helps to diversify and develop
the economy. But the experience of Nigeria so far, and of other processors
at origin, suggests that the odds are against success.
To compete with the industrialised world, Nigeria and other cocoa producers
must overcome the problems they have experienced with processing at origin,
such as lack of capital and machinery, transfer of technology, trade
barriers, a limited domestic market, and lack of flexibility in blend and
quality.
World processing at origin peaked in the 1980s, and has now fallen below 30
per cent of world totals. The result of a Dollars 250 per tonne levy at
today's prices would be to kill off the export of raw beans, a business
which provides direct or indirect employment for 4m people, according to an
academic study in the 1980s.
It is not clear whether the benefits to Nigeria of cocoa-processing, even it
were a success, outweighs the value of exporting raw beans.
The value of the processed product is still tied to the world's raw cocoa
price, and therefore earnings are just as vulnerable to price fluctuations
as the export of beans. Over-supply of cocoa beans in recent years has
depressed the world price, and has translated into over-capacity and
disappearing margins in processing, even among the biggest and most
efficient plants in Europe.
The processing industry would not lead automatically to a net gain in
foreign currency, because of the costs of importing equipment and
technology. While it would encourage some industrial development and the
growth of skilled people, it would probably reduce the number of those who
are employed throughout the cocoa business, because bulk handling and
machinery would cut out some of the labouring jobs, both at source and at
the docks.
Nigeria's export finance bank, Nexim, has invested Dollars 200m of soft
loans in the processing industry, credit which is not available to exporters
of raw cocoa.
Yet processing in Nigeria has yet to reach 15 per cent of the volume of its
cocoa crop. Real productive capacity of cocoa processing is about a quarter
of the official total installed capacity, quoted at over 100,000 tonnes. The
older factories run far short of installed capacity, because they lack
equipment, expertise and the capital to buy beans.
Their real combined output is no more than 26,000 tonnes, according to
industry analysts, and three new plants coming on stream in the first half
of 1993, including the Stanmark factory owned by Cadbury Nigeria, will add a
further 38,000 tonnes of real capacity.
The prospect of an export ban is not the only factor holding back cocoa
production. Cocoa farmers in Nigeria have benefited from deregulation and
the abolition of the parastatal marketing board in 1986. They now get the
best price for their beans in the world from exporters or their licenced
buying agents.
Both multinational and local exporters see the potential to expand the
country's cocoa-bean exports. If Nigerian farmers improved the quality of
their trees by using hybrids, and used fertiliser more efficiently,
production would rise significantly, exporters say. But they go on to warn
that, as long as they suspect that a ban or a levy on bean exports may be
imposed, private investment will be limited.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (21): Analysts urge more liberalisation -
Paul Adams assesses progress and setbacks in the agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE 1986 the structural adjustment programme (SAP) has started to provide
practical help and better prices to the small-scale farmers who make up most
of the rural population and account for 90 per cent of agricultural
production.
Devaluation of the naira has strengthened exports and reduced the
competitiveness of certain imports, while progress has been made in the
production of staple and cash crops. Parastatals no longer control the
marketing of farm output.
Nigeria remains, however, a large net importer of food, according to the
latest official figures. Imports in 1990 cost nearly Dollars 436m while
exports during 1990/91 season earned N2.28bn.
More seriously for the farmer, SAP has not prevented costs overtaking
revenues. A study by a Nigerian consultancy shows that agricultural input
costs have risen faster than output prices. Devaluation has been a mixed
blessing for local farmers, while inflation has pushed up interest rates.
Most analysts warn that agricultural growth will fail to outpace population
expansion unless the process of deregulation is completed, funding is
improved and government policies plan for long-term development. The
production gains of the past five years may have been achieved at the cost
of nutrient depletion, soil erosion and deforestation.
Concerns about agricultural policy focus on four main issues:
Too many programmes. The main thrust of SAP has been to nurture small-scale
traditional farming, based on low input costs and high employment. Yet
Nigeria is also pursuing big projects to import machinery. It is also
building large dams which damage the balance of payments, accelerate
environmental problems and are, in any case, geared primarily to
large-scale, sophisticated farming and food processing.
The World Bank has devoted about Dollars 650m - a third of its lending in
Nigeria - to the agricultural sector in order to promote gradual,
small-scale improvements. The principal method has been to fund
decentralised agricultural development programmes (ADPs), which are due to
be established in every state. Cash has also been provided for interstate
projects in fisheries, livestock, forestry, seeds, treecrops, research, and
irrigation of the shallow valleys common in the north.
The Bank has installed local senior management and funded institutions such
as the federal agriculture co-ordination unit in Ibadan, which links the
ADPs in each state, the agricultural projects monitoring and evaluation unit
in Kaduna, as well as an agricultural data bank.
Small-scale funding by the UNDP, the FAO and IFAD complements these aims.
The EC has also invested around Ecu200m (Pounds 165m), partly on specific
crops such as oil palm in the south-east and tea on the Mambilla plateau
near Cameroon.
The ADPs are part of a range of government agencies, such as Women in
Agriculture, the directorate for food, roads, and rural infrastructure, and
the national agricultural land development authority. These agencies do not
always square with the aims of official aid. This applies especially to the
land development authority which aims to clear 50,000ha of land in each
state, to be allocated by state governors.
Environmental concerns. Around 900,000 sq km - almost all the land in
Nigeria not under forest cover - is affected by soil erosion. Soil quality
is affected by the pressures of population growth, intensified grain
production and shorter fallow periods. The estimated cost of deforestation,
caused by the encroachment of farmers, is Dollars 750m annually, while
inappropriate use of chemicals costs a further Dollars 600m. Both could be
checked by stopping incentives to use mechanical equipment and chemicals, by
strengthening farmers' land tenure to give them a stake in sustained growth,
and by increasing to market levels the fees for forestry concessions.
Water resources. In the past two decades, Nigeria has spent Dollars 2bn on
large-scale irrigation projects. Out of an intended area of 338,000ha, only
59,000ha are receiving irrigation from these schemes. The public-sector
river basin development authorities are pressing ahead with further
construction of dams in spite of the greater success and lower cost of
small-scale, private-sector irrigation schemes backed by the World Bank.
Market distortions. The aim of SAP was deregulation, but state controls,
subsidies and protectionism persist. Although farm gate prices have been
freed, the government maintains food security stocks at the federal level,
buffer stocks at state level and small storage facilities at local
government level.
The record suggests that the job could be done better by the private sector.
Fertiliser subsidy costs the government about N2.9bn a year, over half the
total agricultural budget.
Fertilisers, whether produced locally by state-owned Nafcon or imported, are
subsidised. About half of the official supply of 1.4m tonnes a year is
unaccounted for because the corrupt system of state distribution has created
a parallel market. Here, fertiliser sells for about three times the official
price or is smuggled to neighbouring francophone countries.
Mr Ernest Shonekan's promise in January 1993 to hand over distribution to
the private sector has not been fulfilled.
The cereals and rice import ban, which stopped large imports of wheat from
the US, was suspended last year until June 1993. But flour mills have been
unable to operate near capacity because of uncertainty over government
policy.
Most of Nigeria is not suited to wheat production, but other staple crops
are in surplus. A ban on the export of cassava and sorghum has been
circumvented by smuggling.
Stop-go policies have also affected the cocoa sector, one of the main
successes under SAP, as well as sugar, production of which has been
distorted by import duties which have oscillated between 5 and 40 per cent.
In the three decades since independence, Nigeria has been transformed from a
large exporter of food to a large importer. SAP has arrested the sharp
decline which began with the discovery of oil, but it has only gone part of
the way towards liberalising the sector.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (19): Improved connections - Mobile
telephones ease communications for the business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW innovations have eased the problems of business life in Nigeria's big
cities faster than the mobile telephone has done for its small group of
initial users.
The cellular phone system, which Mobile Telecommunications Services began
operating last September, is a striking example of the benefits of
liberalising and deregulating the economy, allowing the injection of private
sector capital and expertise into state corporations which are being put on
a commercial footing.
Despite a multibillion-dollar investment in telecommunications in the 1970s,
the sector remained a byword for inefficiency with much of the money going
on inappropriate systems in which kickbacks were common.
The inadequacy of the conventional telephone service is one of the most
obvious frustrations of living and working in Nigeria, even for those who
have access to a telephone. Making an inter-city call could be more
difficult than phoning abroad, while calls within Lagos often take hours to
complete.
When the US company Digital Telecom formed MTS in 1992 with state-owned
Nitel, Nigeria had 350,000 telephones on an outdated and inefficient
land-line system for a population of 88m, and there were no advanced mobile
communications. Although there have been improvements in the land-line
system in the past six months, notably Nitel's new digital phone lines, the
development of cellular systems is significantly faster and cheaper.
MTS, in which 55 per cent of the equity is owned by the Atlanta-based
Digital Telecom and 45 per cent by Nitel, is developing a Dollars 65m
infrastructure in cellular, paging, trunk radio and voice mail which will
collectively serve 50,000 subscribers and already has more than 3,500 users
in Nigeria's three main urban areas: Lagos to Ibadan, Kano to Abuja, and
Port Harcourt.
'Around Dollars 55m of the initial investment was made by Nitel, building on
their existing facilities,' says David Greenberg, managing director of MTS.
'The challenge for Digital Telecom will be to carry out and finance the
expansion of the system to keep pace with demand.'
With MTS attracting about 1,000 new subscribers a month, Mr Greenberg can
foresee congestion. 'New users' connecting time tends to be high. But there
is a learning curve and after a while their calls will be more brief or they
will make more use of our other facilities, such as voice mail and paging
which we hope eventually to extend to 300,000 users,' says Thomas Wright,
technical director. 'We have about 3,000 phone subscribers in Lagos, where
our three cell sites are already at full capacity on grade of service.'
At present cost does not appear to be a constraint, although MTS sells the
mobile phones at prices ranging from Dollars 1,500 to Dollars 2,500 and
there is a one-off activation fee of Dollars 2,500 and a monthly charge of
Dollars 60 a month before the user has made any calls. The company sees
demand coming mainly from businesses and government officials.
'The phones MTS is marketing are state-of-the-art,' says Mr Greenberg. 'Some
of the Motorola equipment we supply here, such as the Microtak 2, is
considered a status symbol even in the US.'
Mr Greenberg is confident that Digital Telecom have made the right choice in
coming to Nigeria and choosing Nitel as a partner. 'Nitel have given us full
support. When we asked for a dedicated line in Abuja we got it within one
day.
'The company has 200 staff, 90 per cent locally employed. We are committed
to training Nigerian staff to manage and maintain the whole operation.'
In the long term, MTS hopes to extend radio communications to the rural
areas where there are few or no landlines. Mr Greenberg believes the
cellular systems will help to take the strain off the landlines.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (18): Cash call problem solved - Nigeria
still on course to produce 2.5m barrels a day, says Chief Asiodu / Chief
Philip Asiodu, secretary for petroleum resources, interviewed by Paul Adams
and Michael Holman, expresses optimism about Nigeria's troubled LNG project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much is the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's (NNPC) cash
shortage holding back development of the oil and gas industry?
A certain amount of our oil proceeds is dedicated to cover these cash calls.
Last year, in order to finance some other operations, there was some money
borrowed and that is being replaced. There is no problem with meeting our
cash calls now that we have negotiated with the oil companies to scale down
investment in our joint ventures by 10 per cent. Our partners assure me that
it will not affect our ability to build up capacity over 1993.
After last month's cut in its Opec production quota, does Nigeria still aim
to increase output to 2.5m barrels a day?
Yes, we very much hope to do that. The investments we have just been
discussing are not only to maintain existing capacity but also to build up
to a capacity of producing about 2.5m barrels a day. The latest OPEC quota
is for the second quarter of 1993. In June we shall meet again and review
the market. But in the medium and long term the world will rely more on OPEC
to meet increasing consumption so it is wise to invest in the discovery of
more oil if it is there.
Will the amount of proven reserves of Nigeria affect its production quota?
Not immediately because if we relate quota to proven reserves strictly, some
of the Gulf states would have a bigger quota. But what we are now saying is
that the quota should not look simply at production without considering a
country's internal direct consumption of crude oil, quite apart from
consumption for processing products for export. It is the oil that is for
export which affects the world prices and we think that for countries with a
large population there is a built-in penalty unless you take into account
internal consumption, and we shall be arguing this more and more.
Why is Nigeria offering foreign oil companies production sharing agreements
instead of joint ventures for the new deep water blocks and what is delaying
these agreements?
Actually the first production sharing contract was signed in 1973 and that
was to be the pattern of subsequent concession agreements but then we had a
change of government and of policy.
The advantage for us now is that it is a way of ensuring that necessary
exploration goes ahead but that we do not have to put money up front. In a
situation where we need every penny and our cash flow is not all that
buoyant, there really is no point in committing large sums of money to very
risky exploration when it is possible to have mutually satisfactory
arrangements which does not tie up our funds. The big oil companies take the
initial risk but if the oil is found there is an equitable formula for
recovering their costs and we want to move more and more towards that.
Indeed, I think we could have done more of this between 1973 and now and
saved some privation in other sectors. There were delays in signing last
year which were quite unnecessary. I have given a deadline to conclude
several such agreements by the end of March.
Can the LNG project be brought back on track?
It is not off track completely. At the next board meeting of Nigeria
Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd (NLNG), including our technical advisers, the
other shareholders, NNPC, I expect there to be a decision to go back to the
air products process which Shell recommended in 1987.
I have not found good arguments why it was abandoned and preference instead
given to Telearc, the new French process. The alternative, air products
process, accounts for 28 of 30 of the world's LNG plants and Nigeria is not
in a position to experiment with very new technology. There would be
penalties, if we did not deliver on schedule, which we could not absorb. I
cannot recommend that. The indications are we will be offered a fair enough
price from the purchasers of our LNG in April or May of this year. Due to
the recent delay, instead of taking delivery in the third quarter of 1997,
we are talking now of delivery in the first or second quarter of 1998.
Now what is left is to discuss financing and ensure that we do not start to
construct until 100 per cent of the equity is in place. I think Shell will
find that they have to move faster. The important thing is that we want to
take a decision, press the button and make the project irreversible.
What are the appropriate prices of domestic petroleum products, when will
you implement them and what will be the political impact?
We are pitching new prices at a level which will recover our costs of
producing, refining and delivering the products to the consumer, plus enough
for full amortisation and replacement of plant. We are not adding much for
taxation. On that basis we shall get appropriate prices.
We recognise that we cannot get there in one fell swoop. On March 15 we
stopped some subsidies. We will begin by stopping our deficits on the import
of non-conventionals, that is base oils, lube oils ad lubricants and on
aviation fuel. That will not affect the pump price paid by most people.
Before putting up prices of domestic kerosene or petrol, we shall spend the
next three months trying to explain to the public the basic facts: how much
deficit we run every day in trying to satisfy the needs of the consumer.
With two of NNPC's refineries out of action and petrol shortages in the
north, how will you improve the efficiency of the downstream industry?
The Kaduna refinery should be back on stream towards the end of March. It
was not completely down. At the worst stage in early March, it was
delivering less than a third of the normal quantity. Even at full capacity
in Kaduna, we still have to do some bridging from the south. The long-term
solution to that is now under construction - pipelines to Maiduguri and
Yola.
I think that the problem will become easier once we have appropriate pricing
of our products. The distribution system and the refineries have been
running on funding which is not enough even to sustain day-to-day
operations, much less to provide for future upgrading or investment.
The other source of the shortages is the amount of smuggling of Nigerian
products over the borders and, again, sensible domestic pricing will help to
stop that.
Also, the other refinery which is out of action (the old Port Harcourt
plant) is about to come back on stream. With that in place there should be
less of a problem with the efficiency of the downstream industry.
Do you intend to divest some of NNPC'S assets?
I am not a strong supporter of selling the family silver. I do not think
state ownership in the downstream sector is the problem, nor is divestment
the solution. The sector will be thrown open, deregulated in a way that
would allow private sector operators to make profits.
We will have appropriate pricing and people will be free to come and set up
refineries and sell their products for export, and to build private depots
and pipelines if they want.
Would you consider divesting some of your share of the joint ventures
upstream?
That is a different question. That is where we have something to sell. We
would consider divestment upstream to release funds for other projects.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (20): Golden combination shines - Profile:
CMB Toyo Glass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID LONG has little patience for those who have given up on Nigeria.
'This place,' he says, 'will go on forever, because it's got a massive
population, and it's got oil. Nigeria will always have problems, but it will
never go bust.'
His confidence is not without foundation. As chief executive of CMB Toyo
Glass, he heads a company that dominates the local glass packaging market
and recorded pre-tax profits in the year to March 1992 of N120m.
There are, Mr Long points out, more than 100m Nigerians, many of whom buy
soft drinks or beer, most of whom need glasses for their homes and bottles
for their medicines. It is a huge market of which CMB has a 65 per cent
share, supplying bottles to, among others, Guinness, Pepsi, Seven-Up, Limca,
Glaxo, PZ Industries and Beecham.
Furthermore, there is growing regional potential. In three years, exports to
15 countries - including Ghana, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon - have
risen from 3 per cent of turnover to 12 per cent. The export drive has been
helped by the depreciation of the naira, the uncompetitive level of the CFA
franc and the collapse of production in such countries as Liberia and Zaire.
Although the company pays well by Nigerian standards, labour costs - at 4
per cent of turnover - remain low in comparison with European, and even
African, competitors.
CMB benefits from what one Lagos banker calls the 'golden combination' of
powerful Nigerian shareholders, who hold a 40 per cent stake, and a
multinational backer, CarnaudMetalbox - Europe's largest packaging group and
a 53.48 per cent shareholder. The remaining 6.52 per cent is held by Toyo
Glass Company of Japan, CMB's technical adviser until 1991 when Rockware of
the UK took over.
Although Toyo has pulled out, Japanese influence remains - most notably in
the blue overalls worn by all members of staff, including the managing
director. The company invests heavily in training, which has raised
productivity fivefold over three years.
An indication of its confidence came with last year's acquisition of two
furnaces, bringing its total to five. The deal, financed through a N150m
syndicated loan organised by First City Merchant Bank, will enable CMB to
increase output by 50 per cent. Production of smaller bottles will move to
the new furnaces, further improving efficiency at Agbara.
Greater capacity will allow CMB to expand exports without neglecting the
local market. In 1990, it set up a separate export department, largely in
response to the need for scarce foreign exchange required to meet the
Dollars 750,000 monthly spare parts bill.
Naira devaluation has been a two-edged sword, raising the cost of imported
machinery and inputs, but sharpening the potential to earn hard currency
through exports.
Not all is rosy. Agbara, where CMB occupies a 45-acre site, is the best
industrial estate in the country. Yet it has no telephone links and CMB has
had to develop its own 'massive' infrastructure from scratch, installing
generators, transformers and even a water treatment plant.
Uncertainty over the price of foreign exchange makes planning difficult,
particularly in a capital intensive industry where furnaces have to be
regularly rebuilt.
But Mr Long remains undaunted. His philosophy is to 'call the problems
opportunities, look ahead and be quick to react'. The company is already
aiming to raise turnover in the coming year by 67 per cent, with target
sales of at least N2bn by 1997. Given CMB's track record, such ambitions are
not beyond reach.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (16): On stream, on time - There's nothing
else like the Oso condensate field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-FIVE kilometres off the coast of Nigeria, towards the border with
Cameroon, waves lap a gleaming structure of pipes, walkways and funnels. To
the uninitiated, the edifice - which resembles an aquatic Pompidou centre -
might look like any other oil platform. But to those in the know, the Oso
field is something special.
First, Oso produces not oil, but condensate. Unlike oil, condensate exists
in the ground as a gas. As it is forced to the surface, it cools and takes
on the qualities of a light crude. Much of the platform's paraphernalia is
needed to separate and stabilise the condensate and to re-inject associated
gas.
Second, Oso represents that rare thing in Nigeria - a mega-project, worth
Dollars 900m, that has come on stream. According to Mobil's Mr Jim Massey,
executive director for exploration and producing, Oso has successfully left
the drawing board because it is 'simply a very good project, both for
Nigeria and for Mobil. The drives were there for all sides to make it work.'
Mobil discovered the Oso field, which contains 500m barrels of recoverable
condensate, as long ago as 1967. But it was not until 1988, when Opec
excluded condensate from its quota system, that exploitation became
economically attractive.
After several hiccups, the project - a 60:40 joint venture between
state-owned NNPC and Mobil - won 65 per cent loan financing from the World
Bank, the International Finance Corporation and export credit agencies of
Japan and the US. The remaining 35 per cent was provided in the form of
equity by NNPC and Mobil.
In June 1990, contracts were awarded to a consortium of McDermott of the US,
Bouygues of France and Japan's JGC Corporation. Oso came on stream, on
schedule and under budget, last December. The first 600,000 barrels of
condensate were piped on to the Olympic Symphony tanker on Christmas Eve and
delivered to Mobil's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico.
Condensate, which trades for about the same price as North Sea crude, is
refined into petroleum fuel, kerosine and naphtha feedstock for
petrochemicals.
After nearly four months, Oso was producing 50,000 barrels a day (b/d).
On-site engineers were confident that, once 'teething problems' were ironed
out, production would reach the planned 100,000 b/d by mid-April. Oso is
expected to generate Dollars 12bn during its 20-year lifespan and should
recoup its investment within two years.
Looking to the future, Mobil has begun engineering work on Oso II, an
Dollars 800m project to extract natural gas liquids (NGL) from Oso gas and
gas gathered from nearby fields. The NGL would be separated into propane,
butane and pentane-plus for export. Oso II has a tentative start-up date of
late 1996.
But Mobil has so far failed to discover other condensate fields. For the
moment at least, Mr Massey says, 'we don't have anything else quite like
Oso'.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (17): Dream in the balance - David Pilling
reviews plans to exploit gas reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA can afford to squander its natural resources less than most
countries. And yet, after two decades of dreams, little real progress has
been made in the effort to exploit its huge reserves of natural gas through
a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
The Dollars 4.3bn scheme, which seemed finally to be nearing completion at
the end of last year, has all but unravelled. Political interference,
commercial rivalries and lack of coherent planning again threaten to scupper
Nigeria's best hope for export diversification.
The country has proven gas reserves of 2,600bn cu m; more than 11 times the
combined annual consumption of the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium and
Spain . It has an additional 1,800bn cu m of probable reserves. These
resources could earn billions of dollars of badly needed foreign currency.
Nigeria's aim has always been to export its gas in the form of LNG, which is
transported in tankers as a liquid before being 'regassified' in the country
of sale. But ambitious plans for a Dollars 14bn, six-train (processing unit)
plant to produce LNG came to nothing - after more than a decade of
indecision.
The project was subsequently revived as a more modest two-train plant.
Progress was made in the late 1980s with the formation of Nigeria LNG
(NLNG), a joint venture owned by NNPC (60 per cent), Shell Gas (20 per
cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (10 per cent). Shell was appointed
technical adviser.
Initial work was carried out at the proposed site for the liquefaction plant
in Finima, Rivers state. Local people were relocated, and NLNG bought four
ships to transport liquid gas.
Everything seemed to be falling into place when long-term gas purchase
agreements were signed with companies from Italy, Spain, France and the US.
Lending agencies, including the International Finance Corporation, showed
willingness to discuss project funding, and two consortia were asked to bid
for the main contract, worth Dollars 2bn.
However, last October the project was again thrown into confusion. Shell had
assessed the bids, coming down in favour of the Kellogg/Technip (US/France)
consortium, but then the Nigerian government stepped in to dissolve the NLNG
board. The December 22 deadline for awarding the main contract slipped by
with no finance package in place.
Dissolution of the board by Mr Chu Okongwu, then the petroleum resources
minister, was widely understood to signal government dissatisfaction with
Shell's bid selection. Nigerian authorities had made little secret of
support for the Bechtel/Chiyoda (US/Japan) consortium, which was seen as
offering more prospect of employment for Nigerians and technological
transfer.
But critics argue the backroom wrangling had more to do with self interest
and the pursuit of personal gain. Both consortia, they say, were capable of
carrying out the contract. Once the selection had been made, differences
should have been put aside and the contract awarded.
Whatever the reason for dismissing the board, most analysts agree that the
resulting uncertainty has thrown the entire project into doubt.
Pessimists believe that blatant government interference in the contract
award will be enough to put off international investors already wary of
Nigeria's reputation. And it is not clear how long prospective buyers of
Nigeria's LNG will be prepared to wait before seeking alternative suppliers.
(Algeria, Norway and the former Soviet Union all have the potential to
expand production. Venezuela and Quatar are known to be considering LNG
projects of their own.)
Gloom-mongers also suggest Shell's position as technical advisor and
principal multinational backer has been dealt a serious blow. As one
commentator says: 'Shell's credibility as technical adviser has been
destroyed. If Shell got it wrong, then it should not have been appointed.
But if it got it right, there is intolerable political interference.'
Mr Ahmed Joda, the chairman of NLNG until the board was dismissed last
October, concedes Nigeria was in danger of 'missing out on the LNG
opportunity'. In common with many commentators, he believes this may be the
last chance for a long-held dream. 'If we fail to do the LNG now, we may
never do so in the foreseeable future, because of very prohibitive costs,
increasing competition from other countries and the image of unreliability
which we have cut with our joint venture partners and potential creditors.'
None of the main parties involved in the project is prepared to say publicly
where things now stand. One NLNG official described negotiations as 'too
delicate to discuss openly at the moment.'
Nor will anybody comment on rumours that the NLNG board wants to scrap
long-held plans to use gas conversion technology developed by Technip and
Italy's Snamprogetti. Privately, however, officials admit that the more
common Air Products system is under 'serious consideration'.
A decision to change technology at this stage would have serious
implications for the bidding process. Aside from the prospect of further
delays, adoption of the Air Products system would strongly favour the
Bechtel consortium. Air Products would need some convincing before it
reveals technical specifications to a consortium which included Technip,
developer of a rival gas conversion system.
Some people believe the project can still be salvaged. Nigeria, they argue,
remains in as good a position as any country to supply the gas needed by
Europe.
But if Nigeria does not act quickly, its hopes for LNG may slip away.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (14): Focus is on performance -
Privatisation exercise reaches end of the line for the moment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST five years after its creation, the Technical Committee on
Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) is being wound up and replaced by
a Bureau for Public Enterprise.
The change-over marks the end of the privatisation exercise proper with the
focus switching to monitoring the performance of 'strategic ' enterprises
which will remain under state ownership.
Fifty-five of the 111 enterprises originally earmarked for privatisation
have been sold off by the TCPC.
To this can be added a further 33 firms comprising 18 privatised before the
TCPC was established, four which have been commercialised and 11 in which no
further action is required. The committee has decided that eight of the
remaining 23 cannot be privatised because they are technically insolvent or
have a negative net worth arising from accumulated losses.
Another nine are to be privatised before the new government takes over in
five months' time, but the committee has decided not to proceed with the
sale of the country's six government-owned vehicle assembly plants on the
ground that this would be 'disadvantageous' under present conditions. 'We
have no intention of selling unprofitable companies to Nigerian
shareholders,' says one TCPC official.
Three of the plants are operating at very low levels of capacity
utilisation, two have cut back to 'skeletal' operations while one is in
receivership. When, last year, the committee considered selling the
government's 35 per cent stake in Volkswagen Nigeria (VON), the a price was
set at 75k a share which capitalised the government stake at only N22.5m.
According to Dr Hamza Zayyad, the TCPC Chairman VON's assets are worth more
than N400m, and his committee therefore aborted the sale.
The 55 parastatals sold off to date brought in some N3.3bn or five times the
original investment in them by the federal government, estimated at N650m.
The committee is proud, too, of its record in expanding personal share
ownership in Nigeria.
Privatisation sales created 800,000 new shareholders according to the TCPC
though there is a substantial element of double counting here.
One of the committee's final acts before being restructured as the BPE was
the sale of the government's holdings in 13 banks, and public share issues
have been completed for nine of these.
Progress has been slower on the commercialisation front, but by the end of
last year specific reform packages had been prepared for 30 of the 34
affected enterprises and performance contracts signed with most of them.
The steel industry, specifically Delta Steel, described by one diplomat as a
'total disaster' remains to be tackled while performance contracts have
still to be signed with the energy sector, including the NNPC.
Dr Zayyad says that when the full commercialisation programme is in place
annual savings to the government will exceed N5bn, Although no hard numbers
are available yet, Dr Zayyad insists that some parastatals notably the
telecommunications and electricity enterprises, Nitel and Nepa are operating
with 'substantial surpluses'. Nitel recently financed a N3bn investment
programme from internally generated funds, demonstrating what can be
achieved.
Two headache enterprises, Nigeria Airways and the Nigeria Railways Corp, are
being 'deconsolidated'. In the case of the national airline, this involves
privatising Air Nigeria, the international operator, while Nigeria Airways,
which will operate domestic and regional services in West Africa, will
continue to be government-owned.
The plan is to sell 40 per cent of the equity in the international airline,
Air Nigeria, to Nigerian investors while the government retains 20 per cent
and hopefully a joint venture partner, with management control, will put up
the remaining 40 per cent. TCPC officials say there have been 'promising'
talks with two European operators, Swiss Air and Sabena.
Industry sources are sceptical, pointing out that few international airlines
have any appetite for take-overs at this stage of the business cycle while
the airline's international operations are unlikely to be profitable,
especially given British Airways' dominance of the all-important
Gatwick-Lagos route.
The second deconsolidation proposal is even more ambitious, involving
breaking the railways down into four separate firms.
A working party with technical and financial support from the World Bank has
begun to put some flesh on the bones of the proposed restructuring exercise.
It is still too early to pass judgment on Nigeria's privatisation programme,
but for all the success of getting the government out of many enterprises,
including the banks, the fact remains that government investment in
parastatals continues to rise. More money has been injected into the sugar,
steel and aluminium sectors and no progress has been made in tackling the
deep-seated problems of the steel and vehicle assembly industries.
Commercialisation is still in its infancy and during its five-year life the
TCPC did not get to grips with privatising the hundreds of parastatals owned
by the 30 member states of the federation.
The next government will have to push the frontiers of privatisation a good
deal further than the military were prepared to go.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (12): Market re-examined - Multinationals
show interest in main sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL the private sector's complaints about the inhospitable nature of
Nigeria's business climate, year after year companies continue to turn in
handsome naira profits.
Last year, the pre-tax earnings of some 70 listed Nigerian commercial and
industrial companies rose 43 per cent, while after-tax earnings were up 40
per cent. Both fell behind the inflation rate of 46 per cent.
While in hard currency terms earnings have plummeted with naira devaluation
since 1986 and will do so again this year.
Despite this, leading multinationals are taking a fresh look at the Nigerian
market, though in some sectors, - banks and pharmaceuticals - there has been
substantial disinvestment. Almost all the US banks have gone, though this
was partly the result of their industry-specific problems at home. In
pharmaceuticals, Boots, Beyer, ICI and Merck have divested, while Wellcome
has signalled its intention to quit, to be followed, industry sources say,
by Roche and CibaGeigy.
But it is not all one-way traffic. Proctor and Gamble has come into the
market through the Vicks group, and Colgate Palmolive may follow. Rothmans
has opened up in tobacco and Nestle is beginning its second substantial
expansion project in recent years. Glaxo is likely to expand with a Dollars
10m injection of new capital from abroad. Nigerian Bottling has raised N100m
offshore in non-voting equity to strengthen its balance sheet and sharpen
its competitive edge.
CMB Toyo Glass Nigeria recently raised N150m in the Nigerian market to
finance the acquisition of African Glass Ltd, and expand and modernise its
production lines. Guinness is considering a Pounds 5m investment, funded
from head office, to refurbish and expand while Cadbury Schweppes is putting
Dollars 7.5m, partly funded offshore with a loan from the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, into a new cocoa processing plant which will
produce cocoa butter for export.
Some of these investments represent balance sheet restructuring and the
bolstering of working capital that is necessary at a time of rapid inflation
and devaluation. The overseas funding reflects the lower cost of capital
abroad though the Nigerian firms are saddled with the foreign exchange risk
and some indigestion in the domestic capital market, where there were more
than a dozen new issues in the first 10 weeks of 1993.
That all this should be taking place against a background of economic crisis
and political uncertainty is explained by three main strategic
considerations. First, with a GDP of some Dollars 30bn Nigeria is the second
largest market in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa. Few
multinationals, especially in basic consumer goods, can afford to ignore
such a market explaining why the Rothmans, Colgates and Proctor and Gambles
are showing interest. Guinness, for instance, sells 1m hectolitres of its
stout in Nigeria making it the third largest market after Ireland and the
UK. In the mid-80s, Cadbury was selling more Bournvita in Nigeria than in
the rest of the world.
Second, Nigeria is the logical platform from which to operate an Ecowas
(Economic Community of West African States) strategy. Few manufacturers
export significant volumes directly, and the mere mention of the export
processing zone planned for Calabar, provokes ribald comment from
industrialists, but indirect, smuggled exports are important and growing
and, even if the CFA (French African Community) franc is devalued, as widely
anticipated, Nigeria will continue to have a marked competitive edge in
costs in regional markets. One successful exporter, CMB Toyo Glass, says its
labour costs are less than 4 per cent of turnover. But manufacturers are
among the first to admit that delivery logistics, infrastructure and quality
are significant obstacles to exporting.
Third, intense competition in principal world markets is driving
multinationals into peripheral markets which in less competitive times they
might have ignored. Although Nigerian sales are negligible by global
standards, multinationals cannot afford to allow their competitors a free
ride.
Alongside strategic considerations are the need to reduce import dependence
in an economy where between half and two thirds of industrial inputs are
purchased abroad. Cadbury, which with a technical partner, has a worldwide
patent for producing malted drinks from maize and sorghum, Guinness and
Nestle, have all invested in local sourcing.
Multinationals would invest more, making greater use of state-of-the-art
technology were the Nigerian Enterprise Promotion Decree to be amended
allowing foreign firms majority ownership.
But the main obstacles to greater investment in Nigeria are structural -
infrastructure, the level of risk, investment and operating costs and, above
all, market size.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (15): Industrial production falls - The
failure of import substitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY ANY yardstick Nigeria is under-industrialised. In a Dollars 30bn market
with a population of more than 90m people, manufacturing accounts for only
8.5 per cent of GDP, well below the average for countries at this stage of
the development cycle.
Indeed, in the past 11 years manufacturing value added (MVA) has grown at a
mere 1.5 per cent annually, which means that on a per capita basis,
industrial production has been falling.
There can be few more classic examples in Africa of the failure of import
substitution. The latest survey by the Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria
(MAN) covering the first half of 1992 tells the story: capacity utilisation
of 34.5 per cent for manufacturing as a whole, lowest in vehicle assembly,
steel and engineering and electronics and highest in wood and furniture
textiles plastics and rubber, food and non-metallic minerals, primarily
cement,
Over the past three survey periods, imported raw materials have averaged 55
per cent of the total, while value added in manufacturing as a whole was
estimated in 1989 at 46 per cent compared with 92 per cent in the oil sector
and 83 per cent in agriculture.
Aside from mainstream consumer goods the main investment interest in recent
years has focused on downstream oil and gas activities and textiles.
In a high inflation, high devaluation economy, it is hardly surprising that
entrepreneurs should have targeted trade and finance rather than
manufacturing. Pretax returns on investment are highest in trading (up to
100 per cent) followed by construction (50 per cent) and the finance sector
(30 per cent).
Five crucial constraints to industrialisation in Nigeria have been
identified:
Poor profitability relative to trade, finance and construction;
Infrastructural and regulatory constraints which mean that operating costs
are up to a third higher in Nigeria than elsewhere. Investment costs are
estimated to be some 50 per cent above international standards.
The high risk climate of political and economic uncertainty that makes
long-term planning extremely difficult.
The absence of an enabling environment in terms of macro-economic stability,
observance of legal contracts, inadequate patent law provisions, the high
and escalating crime rate, etc.
Restrictions on ownership in the form of the Nigeria Enterprise Promotion
Decrees (NEPD).
There is no quick-fix way out of this morass, though there are at least two
administrative steps the Shonekan government could take during its brief
tenure: first, amend the NEPD, thereby allowing foreign firms already in
Nigeria to have majority ownership of their subsidiaries, and, second,
abolish the existing system whereby new investments must run the gauntlet of
official approval through the IDCC, and setting up an investment promotion
agency to replace the existing approval machinery.
The accelerated depreciation of the naira over the past year will boost
local sourcing and exports, but there are still some hard policy choices to
be made. The privisation agency's gloomy conclusion that the country's six
vehicle assembly plants cannot be privatised because of low capacity
utilisation and deteriorating commercial and financial performance
underscores the need for a new strategy towards capital intensive low-value
added activities where Nigeria has no competitive advantage.
Yet, the federal government has actually increased its investment in
capital-intensive manufacturing, through the recapitalisation of Savannah
Sugar and new investment in the Ajaokuta steel project, the aluminium
smelter, the fertiliser industry and Nigerian Machine Tools.
One of the first tasks of the incoming civilian administration later this
year will be to develop a coherent industrial strategy, which, in all
probability, will mean some short-term de-industrialisation as low value
added, highly protected activities are restructured or allowed to go under.
Industrial growth will have to come from labour-intensive, consumer goods
activities as well as upstream and downstream petroleum and gas-related
manufacturing.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (10): Debilitating burden grows - Nigeria
is now classified as a heavily indebted low-income country and is thus
eligible for concessional relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRUCTURAL adjustment may have gone some way to liberalising Nigeria's
struggling agricultural and manufacturing sectors but it has failed to
liberate the economy from its debilitating external debt burden.
The dollar value of Nigeria's external debt has, in fact, grown by some 50
per cent since the structural adjustment programme began in 1986. The IMF
estimates that Nigeria's total external debt stock was Dollars 28.9bn at the
end of last year, equivalent to 113 per cent of the country's gross domestic
product.
The share in the total debt stock of official government debt owed to
members of the Paris Club stock has grown steadily over the past five years
to 62 per cent last year.
The UK is the largest single creditor government. The share of multilateral
institutional debt has also risen, to 14 per cent at the end of 1992.
The trend towards official debts accelerated last year following last
January's debt reduction agreement between the Nigerian government and the
London CLub which represents commercial creditors.
Nigeria's London Club debts have fallen from Dollars 5.96bn in 1991 to
Dollars 2.2bn at the end of last year as a result of the agreement. This
reduces the London Club share in Nigeria's total debts to 7.6 per cent.
Without rescheduling, interest payments on Nigeria's external debts would
average Dollars 5bn a year in 1993-96, consuming 36 per cent of Nigeria's
total export revenue.
This compares to an average 19 per cent for all developing countries last
year and 30 per cent for severely indebted countries.
The World Bank and IMF agree that Nigeria's debt burden is unsustainably
high and that the economy will not be able to sustain such a high debt
service burden. Previous debt reschedulings have been conducted using
middle-income country terms.
But World Bank estimates confirm that such reschedulings reduce the interest
burden today by raising it in the future while leaving the debt stock little
changed, as the charts show.
Nigeria is now officially classified as a heavily indebted low-income
country and is thus theoretically eligible for concessional debt relief. The
charts track the likely effect on the debt service and debt stock of
concessional rescheduling using the enhanced Toronto or the more generous
Trinidad terms.
The enhanced Toronto terms were agreed by the Paris Club in December 1991.
They allow for a 50 per cent reduction (in net present value terms) of debt
service payments on non-concessional official debt.
The payment schedule is extended over 23 years, through either cancellation
of 50 per cent of the consolidated or rescheduling at concessional interest
rates.
The World Bank estimates that rescheduling using the enhanced Toronto terms
would reduce Nigeria's debt service ratio to 21 per cent in 1993-96 and cut
the debt stock to Dollars 16bn.
The Trinidad terms were proposed by the UK in 1991 but have never been
applied by the Paris Club. They imply a one-off reduction of two-thirds of
eligible debt and an extended repayment period. They would halve the dollar
value of Nigeria's external debt by 1998.

NIGERIA'S international creditors are faced with a dilemma. Nigeria has no
chance of sustaining non-inflationary growth unless it is granted debt
relief on concessional terms; but the government's recent track record is so
poor that granting debt relief may well mean throwing good money after bad.
Nigeria's current account slipped into deficit last year, further proof of
the macro-economic mismanagement of the past two years. The government's
decision to expand domestic demand at too rapid a pace, and the naira's
depreciation, mean that import values have raced ahead of exports.
Imports grew by 11.6 per cent in 1991 and 7.1 per cent in 1992 while export
values fell by 12.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. The current
account deficit has slipped from a surplus of 7.8 per cent of gross domestic
product in 1990 to a deficit of 2 per cent last year.
The slide into deficit has been accompanied by a growing capital account
deficit caused by capital flight, debt service obligations and outflow of
some Dollars 3.4bn to buy back London Club debt. The government has been
forced to finance the combined and current and capital account deficit of
Dollars 6.2bn by accumulating debt service arrears and running down its
stock of official foreign exchange reserves.
The IMF estimates that debt service arrears increased from Dollars 2.2bn at
the end of 1991 to Dollars 3.4bn at the end of 1992. The UK reports Dollars
600m in unpaid export credit guarantees. Meanwhile, foreign exchange
reserves have fallen from Dollars 4.1bn in 1991 to around Dollars 1bn by the
end of 1992.
The IMF's recent Article 4 report expects that Nigeria's balance of payments
position will remain weak in the medium term. Even if the government is able
to pursue sensible policies, the IMF estimates that Nigeria will face an
average Dollars 2bn a year financing gap throughout this decade.
The IMF's baseline case assumes that the government is able to institute a
programme designed to bring inflation under control. The current account
returns to surplus in 1997 but the debt service ratio, as a percentage of
exports, never falls below 25 per cent. The result, according to the IMF, is
a cumulative residual financing gap, not covered by reserves or private
capital flows, of Dollars 16.5bn up to 2000.
Higher oil prices would ease the burden - the IMF assumes that a Dollars 1 a
barrel rise in oil prices generates an extra Dollars 0.6bn a year in oil
revenues - but, within a reasonable range of projections, would not close
the financing gap. Conventional debt rescheduling merely postpones the
problem.
The IMF concludes that 'a durable solution to Nigeria's external debt
problem and the achievement of external viability would require debt
rescheduling on concessional terms, including a significant reduction in the
stock of debt'.
Yet Nigeria will not be handed debt relief on a plate, regardless of the
IMF's projections. The Paris Club creditors have made it plain that Nigeria
must first agree a tough and comprehensive adjustment programme with the
IMF, and establish a track record.
The British government has said it will support concessional debt relief for
Nigeria if an IMF programme is signed but not all the creditors are so
amenable. Germany and Japan remain sceptical that a reduction in the debt
stock is needed for external viability.
Nor are the World bank and the IMF confident that an agreement can be
reached soon. The transitional council has said publicly that it would like
to agree a shadow programme with the IMF in April, hoping that a two-month
track record will be sufficient to produce a fully-fledged agreement and
unlock debt relief. But World Bank officials say this timetable is
unrealistic.
The best the transitional council can hope for is a shadow programme which
endorses the government's proposed policy framework but requires a six to
nine months track record before an extended structural adjustment facility
can be signed.
The transitional council is prepared for some hard negotiating. 'The IMF
will tell us they want to see lots of good evidence before they can act,'
says one senior council member. 'But I say, for God's sake help us to
succeed because this is Nigeria's last chance.'
Finance minister Chief Dele Olashore takes a tougher stance. 'If the western
creditors withhold support and want us to commit suicide then they will lose
as well as us. I hope that they are informed enough to prevent that from
happening.'

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (8): Private sector's patience tested to
the limit - Monetary policy has run out of control over the past year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EARLY months of 1993 have been a trying period for Nigeria's industrial
and banking community.
The confusion over exchange rate policy is testing the private sector's
patience to the limit.
Nigeria's monetary policy has run out of control over the past year,
demonstrated by the growing gap between the parallel market and official
exchange rates. This gap was closed in March 1992 by an 80 per cent
depreciation of the naira which the central bank governor describes as 'a
very courageous decision'. 'Other things being equal,' he says,'it could
have stabilised the exchange rate and the economy.'
But other things were not equal. Net credit to the federal government has
continued to rise, by 130 per cent last year, while broad money rose by 55
per cent and inflation accelerated to an annual rate in excess of 50 per
cent, in spite of the compulsory sale of N32bn in stabilisation securities
to mop up excess liquidity.
Not surprisingly, the demand for dollars grew as investors tried to reduce
their naira balances.
By December it was clear that the central bank was running out of foreign
exchange reserves and could not continue to supply unlimited amounts of
dollars at the official rate of N20 per dollar. The parallel market spread
widened to 20 per cent from 5 per cent in mid-year.
But rather than allow the official rate to depreciate, the central bank
responded first by cancelling auctions and then switching to a Dutch auction
system which only fuelled the depreciation. The nadir was reached in
mid-February when the central bank cancelled an auction in the face of bids
in excess of N30 from dollar- starved banks.
The confusion is explained by divisions within the government. Finance
secretary Chief Dele Olashore wants to stabilise the rate around N20 while
the central bank wants to depreciate the rate and close the parallel market
spread. In recent weeks the rate has been fixed at N24.99 to the dollar and
the exchange allocated on a pro rata basis.
But with less than 20 per cent of demand satisfied, the parallel market
spread has continued to grow and the business community remains frustrated.
The dispute has come at the wrong time for the central bank which had been
hoping to shift from direct credit controls to an indirect policy based on
open market operations.
It has already abolished credit ceilings for financially sound banks and
granted licences to four new discount houses. But it does not now expect to
establish a liquid treasury bill market in time for an April start.
The problem is partly that the current unstable envir-onment makes
identifying stable relationships between interest rates, money supply and
inflation very difficult.
More fundamentally, the bank cannot hope to establish a credible TB market
until the fiscal deficit is reduced and inflation is brought under control.
Open market operations, the IMF argues, can only work if the bank can
enforce the statutory limit on the the federal government's access to
monetary finance, at present 12.5 per cent of federal revenues. But, as one
banker pointedly asks, 'Who will bounce a cheque from the presidency?'

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (9): A tighter rein on public spending -
Tony Hawkins examines the budget's objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE FAILURE of structural adjustment in Nigeria could be blamed on a
single policy, it would have to be the military government's inability or
unwillingness to balance the budget. 'The lack of fiscal discipline,' says
Chief Shonekan 'is the bane of our economy,' - an assessment justified by
official statistics showing that 94 per cent of last year's N44bn budget
deficit arose from supplementary and off-budget spending. His transitional
government acknowledges five steps are crucial to restoring and maintaining
fiscal balance:
Broadening the tax base to reduce the existing 80 per cent dependence on
petroleum revenue.
Phasing out the petroleum 'subsidy', which would bring in an extra N62bn in
gross revenue, though in net terms, once government's own spending on fuel
is taken into account the actual revenue gain would be significantly less,
perhaps in the region of N40bn.
A debt reduction agreement with foreign creditors that would reduce the
level of scheduled debt service payments, estimated, last year, at a quarter
of GDP or 133 per cent of federally-retained revenue.
The introduction of effective controls over public revenue and expenditure,
including a revamped public sector investment programme, and
The privatisation and commercialisation of remaining state-owned
enterprises.
The 1993 budget, the first and only one for which Chief Shonekan's
transitional administration is likely to be responsible, is the first step
along this lengthy, obstacle-ridden road to reform. Outlining a medium term
strategy in his budget speech, the chief said the government would reduce
the budget deficit from 12.4 per cent of GDP in 1991 to a manageable 3.3 per
cent by 1995. A budget monitoring committee to assess actual performance in
meeting revenue and spending targets has been created, along with an
interdepartmental working party of officials charged with recommending how
best to entrench fiscal co-ordination and transparency in Nigerian public
finance.
To broaden the tax base, a modified value added tax (MVAT), levied on 10
categories of goods and 23 services at an initial rate of 5 per cent, is to
be introduced in mid year, with 80 per cent of the revenue going to state
governments and the rest to the federation.
Basic food items, pharmaceuticals, rents, vehicles and components, will all
be exempt, but the government still expects the new tax to bring in
significantly greater revenue than the existing sales tax which it will
replace.
On paper, the 1993 budget forecast of deficit of N28.6bn (5.6 cent of GDP)
is highly optimistic. Not only is the government being pressured to make
payments for extra budget commitments undertaken before the transitional
council took office, but with inflation accelerating, the authorities
committed to picking up the tab for the party conventions and the subsequent
presidential elections, it is clear the very modest 4 per cent rise in
planned spending this year will be overtaken by a substantial margin. In any
event, the deficit forecast understates the true position because debt
service obligations are restricted to 30 per cent of foreign exchange
earning. If full servicing is assumed, the deficit doubles to approximately
9.7 per cent of GDP.
But even with spending overruns, the actual deficit is likely to be well
below this worst case scenario. With external arrears of Dollars 2.6bn last
September and over Dollars 3bn by now, it is clear the government will
underprovide debt servicing again this year. Furthermore, the 1993 budget
assumes a price of Dollars 17.50 a barrel and an exchange rate of N20 to the
dollar. The price for crude has since moved above Dollars 19 and the
exchange rate is forecast to average N27.5 this year.
Devaluation cuts both ways, however, raising revenue but also increasing
expenditure, especially external debt service which will be closer to N55bn
than the N40.5bn forecast. On a conservative estimate, federally retained
revenue will be at least N25bn above forecast so that even if government
does overspend, it should still be possible to keep the deficit below N25bn
or less than 4 per cent of GDP.
The Shonekan team makes no secret of its determination to keep a tight rein
on spending. More important, by setting up a new system of budget monitoring
and, possibly, launching the new MVAT, it may be able to change the
country's fiscal culture. After all, the fiscal problem has more to do with
corruption and managerial and administrative incompetence than any
deep-seated structural defects. If the federal and regional administrations
could collect even threequarters of the non-oil revenues to which they are
entitled, the underlying situation would be healthier. So much so, in fact
that the government would do better to stick to straightforward retail and
manufacturing level consumption taxes, such as excise duties and sales tax,
rather than opting for the more complex and more costly VAT.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (7): A sector that needs refor - The
authorities have themselves to blame for an unsound banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSMEN, residents and taxi-drivers are unanimous in blaming the 'VI
banks' for the worsening traffic and telephone congestion on Victoria
Island.
Dozens of new banks which sprang up on the island acquired a notoriety in
1990-91 as 'foreign exchange shops', buying foreign exchange at a
'subsidised' price from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and selling it to
customers at a handsome premium.
Many were not banks at all, because they had no deposit base and the only
service they provided was to supply foreign currency. With their access to
foreign exchange under the previous foreign exchange allocation system, all
banks were guaranteed a weekly allocation of dollars; and with leading firms
operating literally dozens of bank accounts, in an effort to secure enough
foreign currency to finance essential imports, banking was a low-risk,
high-return business.
Then came March 5, 1992, when the naira was devalued, the parallel market
premium virtually eliminated, and banks could no longer arbitrage between
the official and the free markets. Suddenly, banking became a different
proposition altogether. Firms no longer needed to operate multiple accounts
to be sure of getting their foreign currency requirements, nor could they be
held to ransom and forced to pay a premium for free-market funds, because
the CBN and the autonomous market between them were able to supply the
market's needs.
By the end of the year, the strains were beginning to show, especially as
the authorities forced banks to hold growing amounts of low-yielding
'stabilisation securities'. Those without a sizeable deposit base, by far
the majority of the country's 120-odd banks, found themselves in volatile
market conditions, paying anything from 30 to 80 per cent at different times
of the year, for interbank money, but earning a maximum of 21 per cent on
stabilisation securities. There were reports of 'defaults' in the interbank
market as some of the merchant banks, in particular, were squeezed by high
interest rates on their borrowings and a major reduction in income.
According to the central bank, roughly one third of the country's banks are
now classified as 'unhealthy' or 'distressed', which in at least half a
dozen cases is no more than a euphemism for insolvent. These 40 banks, some
of them the old state-owned banks which have been in trouble for years, and
others from the new breed of VI banks, were barred from bidding at the
weekly foreign exchange auction that was their meal ticket until a year ago.
Recently, however, the pendulum has swung back in favour of the unhealthy
banks. Once again, foreign exchange is being allocated at the auction, this
time on a pro rata basis relative to the bank's application for foreign
exchange. At the auction on March 11, banks were given less than 20 per cent
of their bids, again forcing importers and merchants to scour Lagos for
foreign exchange and to pay a premium for a 'blend' of official market funds
at N25 to the dollar and free-market funds costing as much as N34. For the
disqualified 40 banks, its vital to get back into the auction where there is
easy money to be made.
Clearly, none of this makes for a sound, healthy banking system. The
authorities have only themselves to blame. Until the issue of new banking
licences was suspended in 1991, they licensed just about anyone, provided he
could put down the necessary initial capital N20m until February 1991, and
now N50m. Banks were given until mid-1992 to raise their capital to the new
level, but the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) subsequently
reported that, at the end of 1991, only 16 out of 65 commercial banks and 15
out of 54 merchant banks had raised their capital ratios to the required
levels.
The CBN had neither the expertise nor the resources to provide the level and
extent of supervision necessary, while rapid money supply growth ensured
that funds were not difficult to come by. Although liquidity was not really
an issue, because the foreign exchange traders were able to earn handsome
returns with only minimal liquidity levels, the 1991 NDIC report found that
20 of 116 operating banks had been unable to meet the specified 30 per cent
minimum liquidity ratio.
Last September, the CBN set out six criteria against which a third of the
country's banks were adjudged unhealthy or distressed. The criteria
included: 'sound' management, prudential guidelines, minimum capital, cash
and liquidity ratios, and a new 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio.
Bankers say that some of the unhealthy institutions will not find it
difficult to satisfy the bank inspectors the next time around, and already
one bank has been allowed to return to the auctions. But with money market
conditions set to tighten this year, the weeding-out process by liquidation,
merger or takeover will gather momentum. In its medium-term policy document,
the government accepts the need for moving beyond the classification of
banks to closure or enforced restructuring and more diligent supervision
than in the past.
The return of the foreign exchange market premium may delay the process; but
since any strategy of exchange-rate stabilisation implies a reduction in the
'real' money supply - that is, inflation running well ahead of money-supply
growth over the next year or two - the going will get tougher for all the
banks. Ironically, the stabilisation security technique of mopping up excess
liquidity punishes precisely those banks that the authorities should be
encouraging, the liquid and responsible performers. One merchant banker says
that no less than a quarter of his balance-sheet value is tied up in
stabilisation securities, on which the return is not much more than half his
cost of funds. 'The more liquid you are, the more you suffer'.
The N32bn now held in stabilisation securities (40 per cent of the money
supply) is due to be phased out from April, as the central bank switches to
an indirect system, in the form of open-market operations, to control
liquidity. As that happens and the authorities are forced to pay market
rates for their funds, rather than borrowing from the CBN, pressure on
margins should ease as the banks earn 40 per cent or more on treasury bills,
rather than 21 per cent on stabilisation securities. But at the same time,
credit demand will fall as government borrowing is reduced and as high
nominal interest rates, a falling naira, and declining domestic demand force
traders and manufacturers to cut back their borrowings.
Inevitably, the authorities will soon be forced to abandon their efforts to
prop up the naira, and the arbitrage window being exploited by some of the
banks will slam shut again as it did a year ago. The writing will then be on
the wall for many of the 'unhealthy third'.

IF NIGERIA'S renewed commitment to economic reform takes root, much of the
credit will go to the participants at a remarkable summit in the federal
capital of Abuja.
For three days in February leaders from the public and private sector,
joined by officials from international development agencies and senior
diplomats, conducted a rigorous appraisal of the economic health of the
nation.
'Your mission,' President Ibrahim Babangida told them in his opening
address, 'is to chart an appropriate strategy and help to put in place other
reforms which are still needed to fully restructure our economy.'
The summit, intended to become an annual event, was the brainchild of Chief
Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council and a
prominent businessman. Inspired in part by President Bill Clinton's
pre-inauguration economic conference in Little Rock and encouraged by
Nigeria's business community keen to assist one of their own, Mr Shonekan
struck an ambitious note: 'We can lay the foundation for a more buoyant
economy for the 1990s and beyond.'
The two days that followed were marked by a sombre analysis of the country's
economic crisis, coupled with enthusiasm about Nigeria's potential.
Participants extolled the virtues of the free market, called for less
government intervention, and advocated measures to attract local and foreign
investment.
Group discussions focused on monetary and fiscal policies, debt management,
capital markets, law and order, and Nigeria's image abroad.
What emerged was a blueprint for change, which will be the subject of
further debate and consultation at regional gatherings and at suitable
venues abroad.
Copies of the summit report (which includes the main speeches, as well as a
list of participants that reads like a who's who of the business sector) are
now available.*
Bringing together such a range of participants at short notice was in itself
no mean achievement.
But in the weeks that followed the limitations on the transitional council's
capacity to implement the Abuja blueprint have become increasingly evident.
A post-summit session is due to take place in Lagos tomorrow at which a
frank appraisal of progress - or lack of it - is expected.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (5): Only a little bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEREGULATION of Nigeria's capital market, which has been on the agenda for
years now, got as far as the launch pad in February with the publication of
a set of guidelines for the new issue market.
The package came as something of a disappointment falling a long way short
of a little bang, let alone a big one.
The most important advance is the decision to shift the responsibility for
pricing new issues from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the
issuing houses, the risk takers themselves. But this is hedged around with
qualifications, requiring the issuing house to state the method of valuation
used in fixing the price - market forces, it seems, will not suffice -
making underwriting mandatory, setting the maximum underwriting commission
at 1.5 per cent, and insisting that total issue costs are less than 10 per
cent of the issue value. The SEC must vet prospectuses and will also have to
approve the basis of allotment where issues are oversubscribed.
That such a package qualifies as deregulation is itself a commentary on how
controlled the market is. The guidelines are a modest step forward to the
extent that shares are now priced by the issuing house but the failure to
deregulate the secondary market - on the Nigerian Stock Exchange share
prices may not fluctuate by more than a ceiling margin of 10 kobo (less than
half a US cent) - has been criticised by brokers and banks.
For all its shortcomings, the Nigerian market has grown rapidly and is
playing an increasingly important role in financing the private sector,
though not government which has not issued any gilts for seven years. The
number of listed companies which stagnated for much of the 1980s, increasing
from 93 in 1982 to 102 by 1988, has since risen rapidly. There has been a 50
per cent increase since 1988 with 156 companies now listed on the NSE's six
floors around the country. A seventh floor is planned for the capital,
Abuja.
The new issue market, which was dormant in the mid-80s, when only N335m of
new capital was raised in 1987/88, has since come to life. In 1991, N1.5bn
was raised in 52 issues and this increased 170 per cent last year to a
record N4.1bn from 67 offers.
On the secondary market, capitalization rose 44 per cent last year to
N32.5bn and has since increased further to N33bn at the end of February. The
share price index jumped more than 40 per cent during 1992 to 1108 and by
mid-March had edged ahead to 1123.
Deregulation, the advent of discount houses and the plan to fund government
deficits through the market rather than by printing money at the Central
Bank, will give the market a boost over the next 18 months. If the
government is serious about maintaining high interest rates - forcing firms
to go to the market for new equity - and the issue of tradeable securities
to fund the fiscal deficit, then both the new issue market and the stock
exchange are set to grow even more rapidly.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (4): Quick-fix solutions not on offer -
Tony Hawkins assesses the steps taken to translate the economic dream into
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<TEXT>
AT NO time in the past 20 years, and possibly since independence, has
Nigeria had an administration so committed to economic reform. But
commitment alone will not be enough to translate the Abuja Economic Summit
dream into reality. Within weeks of their taking office, it was apparent
that the admirable Mr Ernest Shonekan and his transitional team lacked the
resources, the authority at the end of the day - the military are still
calling the shots - and, above all, the time to do more than outline a
platform for future reform and economic growth.
The challenge is to establish a sufficiently secure economic policy
framework that will survive the return to full-blooded civilian rule. In
just five months, the transitional council has to tackle the twin tasks of
short-term crisis management - stabilising the naira, slowing inflation,
bringing a semblance of order and discipline to Nigeria's public finances -
and creating a medium-term policy framework, an enabling environment within
which sustained growth can be achieved.
It is a formidable task, and, almost certainly, an impossible dream given
the time constraint and the enormity of the inherited economic crisis.
On taking office, Mr Shonekan inherited foreign reserves of under Dollars
1.4bn (less than eight weeks' import cover); a record N44.2bn budget
deficit, escalating foreign debt arrears of more than Dollars 3bn, 46 per
cent inflation and an unsustainable exchange rate.
On the positive side, however, the military also left behind the outline of
a coherent medium-term economic strategy which the Shonekan team hopes to
translate into some kind of formal (a policy framework paper endorsed by the
World Bank and IMF) or informal agreement ( a 'shadow' IMF programme) before
it is forced to leave office. A Bank/Fund team is visiting Abuja this month
to discuss such a programme, but the substantive Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) programme that Nigeria must have, if it is to get
off the external debt hook, cannot be negotiated with what the international
community sees as a lame-duck transitional government.
At this juncture, there is just no way of assessing the likely economic
policies of a civilian president, since the economy figures only at the
periphery of the political debate. The omens are disturbing, however.
In recent weeks, one frontrunner, Chief Abiola, has pledged to limit debt
service payments to 8 per cent of exports, a second, Ambassador Kingibe, has
come out against removing the petroleum subsidy while a third, Dr Joe Nwodo,
has promised to double Nigeria's exports in the next four years by
exploiting 15 solid minerals and to fix the naira exchange rate.
In Nigeria, the economic policy debate is conducted at two very different
levels. The contrast between the largely hard-headed realism of private
sector participants at the Abuja summit and the popular debate in the media
between presidential aspirants, assorted 'renowned' academic economists,
lawyers and journalists, could hardly be greater.
For the populists, the pillars of a coherent medium-term strategy include a
'realistic' administered exchange rate as distinct from one determined by
market forces, antagonism towards foreign capital and foreign equity
investment, the conviction that because Nigeria is an oil exporter its
citizens deserve the cheapest fuel in the world, and the, sadly justified
historically, belief that any Nigerian government will squander whatever
resources it obtains from taxation and foreign borrowing.
From an economic viewpoint, the optimal outcome would be an extended tenure
for Chief Shonekan and his 'businessman's government'. They understand what
has to be done, though some members of the administration still hanker after
quick-fix solutions that simply are not on offer.
A stiff dose of deflation, fiscal and monetary, lasting at least a year will
have to be imposed. Unquestionably the key challenge is that of budgetary
reform, since the roots of economic crisis - rampant inflation, a
depreciating exchange rate, unstable money markets, unproductive public
investment and the crowding out of private sector investment - lie in a
fiscal deficit averaging 7.7 per cent of GDP since the structural adjustment
programme was launched seven years ago.
The phased removal of the petroleum subsidy, the closer monitoring of public
spending and the planned introduction in midyear of a modified VAT will all
help to curb the deficit, but the structural deficit problem will be
resolved only when Nigeria has secured a debt reduction agreement with its
Paris Club creditors. Last year full debt servicing would have absorbed 133
per cent of federal revenue and only when this is reduced to manageable
proportions will Nigeria escape from the crisis of a yawning budget deficit
and escalating payments arrears, at home and abroad.
Only when the core problem of the fiscal deficit is tackled and an ESAF loan
and Paris Club debt reduction agreement is in place, will a return to
macro-economic stability become possible. Last year, 46 per cent inflation
was fuelled primarily by the naira devaluation on the one hand and the
explosion in government borrowing from the banks, especially the central
bank, on the other. The money supply (M2) increased 57 per cent, largely
reflecting the 96 per cent growth rate of lending to government.
The Shonekan administration, which had no hand in these fiscal and monetary
excesses, is now picking up the tab. According to businessmen, inflation has
accelerated to between 65 per cent and 70 per cent, while the downward
pressure on the naira, driven by excessive liquidity in the banking system,
has widened the parallel market premium from 5 per cent for much of 1992 to
40 per cent.
With a foreign exchange budget of Dollars 4.7bn for the year and dollar
demand running at an annual rate of Dollars 14bn, monetary policy will have
to be tightened and interest rates pushed even higher than the current 45
per cent to 50 per cent borrowing rate to slow inflation and curb domestic
demand. Inflation is going to get a good deal worse before it gets better.
Some packaging firms have doubled their prices in the first quarter of the
year; resumed naira depreciation and the phasing out of the petrol subsidy
will push inflation above 100 per cent in the third quarter, if not sooner,
and even the optimists expect the naira to average N30 to the dollar this
year compared with N16 in 1992.
Given this inheritance there is little the transitional council can do but
tighten the fiscal and monetary taps, and sweat it out while turning a deaf
ear to the cries of pain from all sectors of the economy. After growing very
rapidly - 8.5 per cent a year between 1988 and 1990 - GDP growth slowed to 4
per cent in 1991/2 - and will turn negative this year with the OPEC cut in
oil production, falling investment as high nominal interest rates and credit
restraint start to bite and as import growth is reined in and public
spending declines substantially in real terms.
The balance of payments deteriorated from rough balance on current account
in 1991 to a deficit of some Dollars 500m last year, but with the outflow on
capital account of some Dollars 3.4bn to buy back London Club debt, there
was a huge Dollars 5.7bn deficit on capital account. The overall deficit of
Dollars 6.2bn was financed partly by accumulating Dollars 2.6bn in arrears
and running down the reserves to Dollars 1.35bn from almost Dollars 6bn a
year earlier.
The current account situation has since worsened forcing the Central Bank to
cut the weekly supply of dollars at the currency auction to only Dollars
60m, to clamp down on open account and bills for collection trade, freezing
an estimated Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn in payments due to foreign
suppliers, and to defer payments for letters of credit until 90 days after
the shipment of goods to Nigeria. These ad hoc measures and the continuing
accumulation of official arrears - Dollars 600m owed to the UK, Dollars 500m
to France and Dollars 400m to Germany - have done nothing for the country's
creditworthiness nor do they get to the roots of the problem.
It is a bleak picture. Chief Shonekan is not going to turn the economy
around in his few months in office, but he is far and away the best option
on offer.
Mr Shonekan given the time, authority and resources is the man most likely
to force through the deflationary package followed by a medium-term strategy
for sustained recovery.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (3): Anxious start to campaign - The
political line-up as Nigeria prepares for an election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA is in the final, most critical stage of a protracted transition from
military to civilian rule. Last week, shortly before this survey went to
press, 10,000 delegates from the National Republican Convention (NRC) and
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) gathered at conventions in Port Harcourt
and Jos to select their presidential candidates.
If all goes to plan, the two contenders face the electorate on June 12. The
winner will be sworn in on August 27, exactly eight years after the palace
coup in which General Ibrahim Babangida ousted General Muhammadu Buhari, who
overthrew the last civilian government on December 31, 1983.
Yet there is little of the optimism that infused the 1979 election campaign
which ended military rule and brought President Shehu Shagari to office.
Instead, many Nigerians view the months ahead with apprehension, and
contemplate a civilian government with mixed feelings.
Despite President Babangida's repeated commitment to a transfer of power,
some well-placed figures are far from convinced that a reason will not be
found to further delay the handover, already put back on three occasions.
They point to a passage in General Babangida's speech of last November, when
he delayed by eight months the advent of civilian rule and ordered fresh
presidential primaries on the grounds that fraud had invalidated the first
attempt.
'We will not abandon you unless we are able to install or guarantee the
installation of a stable democratic order,' the president promise. Sceptics
detect a loophole. Malpractice, real or contrived during the presidential
campaign, will allow General Babangida to intervene yet again, they suggest.
Why he should wish to stay on any longer than absolutely necessary is not
clear, other than a reluctance to surrender power. Work on the president's
retirement estate in Minna is well advanced, and his time in the presidency
has left him comfortably off. There is no early or easy end in sight to the
country's economic crisis. At least two other serious problems could be
bequeathed to his successor: how to extricate Nigeria from its costly and
unproductive involvement in Liberia; and the controversial death sentence
passed on Zamani Lekwot, a retired major-general charged with murder
following inter-communal riots in May last year.
Nigerian forces are the mainstay of the 14,000-strong five nation force,
despatched to Liberia by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) in 1990 to halt a civil war.
No satisfactory resolution to the Liberian tragedy appears in sight, but the
heavy cost of Nigeria's role is proving an increasing burden. Nigerian
officials have been pressing for a greater UN role. In the meantime there is
the danger that the military will want to make one last push against the
rebels. But without a political settlement, disengagement will prove
difficult, and the last push might be just another step into the Liberian
quagmire.
The death sentence passed on Zamani Lekwot, a Christian, is potentially the
most explosive issue in Nigerian politics. The riots themselves, clashes
between two communities in southern Kaduna, the Moslem Hausa and the
Christian Kataf involves more than religious rivalry. There is a clash of
lifestyles involving competition for land - the Hausa and their cattle,
leading a semi nomadic life, and the Kataf farming community, settled on
their small farms.
But the case has been turned into a Moslem versus Christian dispute, with
zealots of both sides fanning the flames. If sentence is carried out,
Christians will be outraged; if commuted, the Moslem community will be
deeply aggrieved. Either way, say concerned community leaders on both sides,
an outbreak of inter-communal violence in Nigeria is a real danger.
Those Nigerians who are not sceptical about the handover date are generally
pessimistic about the calibre of the incoming civilian administration. The
flawed transition programme based on two government-created parties has been
kept alive because most Nigerians believe that the government that will
emerge is, compared to the present military regime, the lesser of two evils.
Few, if any, anticipate a new era free of the corruption long endemic in
Nigerian society, but they do expect a more open government with greater
respect for human rights than displayed by the military.
The leading SDP candidates in the run-up to the conventions were wealthy
businessman Moshood Abiola, 55, a Moslem from the south with a solid
constituency among the Yorubas, and Baba Gana Kingibe, 48, a northern
Moslem.
The NRC front-runner was also a northern Moslem, Bashir Tofa, a 46-year-old
banker and trader. He and Mr Abiola, say political observers, have General
Babangida's blessing.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (2): 'Hope in the economy rekindled' - An
IMF agreement which paves the way to debt relief is within reach, says Chief
Shonekan / Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of Nigeria's federal government and
chairman of the transitional council, answers questions put by Michael
Holman, Africa Editor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What are your main objectives in the six months ahead?
The transitional council has a short-term tenure and it must be properly
focused to make a positive impact. Our overall goal is to lay a solid
economic policy foundation for the next government.
Specific objectives are to re-align government spending with revenue
profile; reduce deficit financing by curtailing extra-budgetary expenditure;
continue with reform measures where necessary; introduce appropriate pricing
of fertiliser and petroleum products; promote accountability and
transparency in the management of public finance and strive to leave the
quality of governance better than we met it.
Can you reach agreement with the IMF in the time available? And if you do,
would you draw on the IMF facility?
Yes, I believe we can reach an agreement with the IMF and our creditors. I
wish to emphasise this time around we are interested in a medium-term
agreement as opposed to the short-term agreements of the past. The
advantages are quite obvious. The IMF and the World Bank are closely
following our efforts in redirecting the focus of macro-economic management.
We are all agreed on the necessary actions to be taken and I know that they
appreciate the problems we confront in pushing through reforms at home. I
expect that they will show understanding in the next round of negotiations.
Our government policy on a draw-down from stand-by facility has been
consistent and 1 see no reason why this should change now. However, I am
made to believe that agreement of a medium-term strategy can enable us to
access the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility and this will be
considered on its own merits at the appropriate time.
It seems unlikely you will win debt relief in the time available: what
impact will this have, politically and economically?
I do not share your view that we will not be granted debt relief before we
quit the stage. The signals our antennae has been picking up are quite
encouraging. My reading of the attitude of our creditors towards our
government since we joined is that of an increasing appreciation of the need
for us to have substantial debt relief if we were to succeed in our efforts
at reform. My recent visit to Prime Minister Major was a case in point.
There is increasing goodwill and international backing for our transitional
council.
There is also an understanding of the problems we confront. The debt burden
is choking us. Over 50 per cent of the 1993 budget estimate goes for debt
settlement. Try as we might, there can be no success in stabilising the
economy unless the debt conundrum is resolved. I am happy our sovereign
creditors realise this point and I am hopeful of a major breakthrough in
this connection before our tenure ends.
How can you ensure your reform programme is pursued by the new
administration; can you bind them to an IMF deal?
The straightforward answer is that we can neither force the incoming
administration to adopt our reform programme nor can we bind them to an IMF
deal. No incumbent government can impose its policies on future
administrations.
Nonetheless, if we introduce policies and programmes that are well thought
out and in the best interest of our nation, it should not be difficult for
the incoming government to adopt them. This is a major reason we have
adopted the central policy of accountability and transparency.
At the end of the day, our honesty of purpose and transparent management
will enable the incoming administration to see the merits of our policies. I
have no doubt future governments will award us a pass mark.
Will the government allow distressed banks to continue operating? Is not a
shake-out of the banking sector overdue?
The government is looking closely at the thorny issue of distressed banks
and a decision will be taken after a thorough analysis. It will be recalled
the liberalisation and deregulation of the whole financial sector has been a
major achievement of the structural adjustment programme. The banking sector
in particular has witnessed changes of major proportions. The number of
banks, for instance, more than doubled within two years, creating enormous
problems of supervision and regulation. To ensure a sound banking
supervision, the government created the Nigerian Deposit Insurance
Coloration (NDIC) and I am happy that as a result, banking practices are
being modernised and rationalised.
However, it is taking the system time to properly digest the rapid changes.
In a deregulated economy, banking reforms and shake-out ought to be a
continuous exercise to have sanity in the industry. Even then, caution must
be exercised because of the pivotal position of banks in the whole economy.
By how much do you expect to increase the price of petrol?
We are in the process of creating a conducive environment for the adjustment
of petroleum products prices. There has been a public debate over this
matter in our country for many years. It has now become an emotive issue of
wide concern.
Regrettably, the debate is befuddled by misconceptions about the utilisation
of revenue to be generated. Very few people question the economic logic of
our decision, but citizens want to be assured the gains will be judiciously
managed to alleviate social hardship. We are now addressing their misgivings
seriously and I am quite confident that we shall succeed. I cannot say
precisely now by how much and when the fuel price adjustment will be.
Do you need the revenue from a price increase to meet the budget deficit
targets?
True enough, the exercise will yield fresh revenue. However, this year's
budget did not include anticipated revenue from adjustment of the fuel
price. With the prudent fiscal management we have already adopted, we will
meet our budget deficit targets anyway.
What are your views on the proposal that part of NNPC assets be privatised?
The petroleum industry remains the veritable success story in our economy
and as such we must ensure that major decisions such as changing the
ownership structure must be taken with circumspection. Put simply, we cannot
afford to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
Be that as it may, I would form an opinion on this proposal after studying
expert analysis of its merits and demerits. If the efficiency of the
industry would not be adversely affected; if the stream of future revenue
accruing to Nigeria would not decrease; if the pricing of the assets to be
sold would be transparently competitive; and if the government's
policy-making capacity in this very sensitive sector would not be
diminished, then I am in support of the proposal.
For some three years or so, vested interests have impeded reform and the
political will has been lacking: what has changed that would allow you to
put promises into practice?
If we assume that your judgment of the policy environment was true, then the
decisive change has been the coming of the members of our transitional
council into government since the beginning of this year. Our council is
principally composed of private sector operators with proven track records.
We are men and women of action and high integrity and the nation knows it is
too late for us in our careers to suddenly become indolent and passive. As
an illustration, I had the privilege to run one of Nigeria's biggest
companies (UACN plc) for over a decade before being invited to serve in the
transitional council.
I had always freely expressed my opinions on the Nigerian economy and the
nation knows what to expect from me. Most importantly, by making
accountability and transparency the cornerstone of our policies, I believe
we will be given a fair chance to put our promises into practice. We have
rekindled hope in the Nigerian economy. Let me declare categorically here
that we have been given a free hand to implement our decisions. I have a
deep faith in the promise of Nigeria and the collective integrity of the
transitional council. I am sure that we will succeed and leave behind us an
enviable legacy.

FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (1): Promises, promises - Nigeria's
civilian-led transitional council needs the soldiers' backing if it is to
implement the hard choices the Abuja recovery plan requires. As the country
prepares for presidential elections, Africa Editor Michael Holman finds that
deeds have yet to match words

NIGERIA'S attempt to put its faltering economic reform programme back on
track is in jeopardy.
Without greater commitment on the part of the military government that
stands behind the country's transitional civilian administration, the effort
will fail, conceivably imperilling the transition to civilian rule due to
conclude on August 27. Without such commitment, Nigeria's sceptical
creditors will withhold assistance and the burden of a Dollars 29bn external
debt will become intolerable. Deepening austerity will exacerbate existing
religious and regional tensions, conceivably threatening the thrice-delayed
transition to civilian rule.
Once again, Nigeria has promised to mend its ways. Last December, an
transitional council was mandated by President Ibrahim Babangida to restore
economic discipline, plan for the future, and run the country until the
winner of June's presidential elections formally takes over in August.
This time the promise carried more weight. The council and its officials
represent the acceptable, respectable face of Nigeria. The chairman, Chief
Ernest Shonekan, is a distinguished and popular businessmen, assisted by
some able colleagues with distinguished careers, and enjoying the backing of
the private sector.
But, as the halfway stage of the council's tenure approaches, it is in
danger of being labelled the best goverment Nigeria never had. Nominally it
is in charge. In reality, it is subservient to the soldiers who have run
Nigeria since December 31, 1983.
The council got off to an encouraging start. The 1993 budget, due to be
delivered on January 1, was efficiently and imaginatively redrafted. What
emerged three weeks later was a ringing reaffirmation of the necessity of
reform, the virtues of the market economy, and the overriding need for
prudent management.
'We must make some hard choices now to preserve the gains of the structural
adustment programme and restore some good measure of stability to the
economy,' Mr Shonekan warned the national assembly.
It was followed not long after by an unprecedented gathering of business
leaders, summoned to the capital, Abuja, for what was billed as Nigeria's
first economic summit. In two days of straight talking, with President
Ibrahim Babangida attending the opening session, the gravity of Nigeria's
economic crisis was made clear. The reform programme launched in 1986 was in
deep trouble. Among the most revealing indicators was the outcome of the
1992 budget: the forecast surplus of N2bn turned out as a deficit of
N44.2bn.
Money supply had increased by 49 per cent during the year, pushing inflation
to 46 per cent. Exchange rate policy had in turn been undermined, and the
naira was buckling. Foreign exchange reserves had fallen from Dollars 4.1bn
in 1991 to around Dollars 1bn by the end of last year - barely two months
import cover - partly because of Nigeria's costly involvement in the
Liberian conflict.
'What we need now is a strong commitment to implementation, and to keep
faith with the reform programme,' General Babangida told the summit. No one
reminded the general that he had promised much the same a year earlier. A
devaluation of the naira from 10.5 to 18 to the dollar had been accompanied
by pledges of fiscal restraint, prudent monetary policies, public sector
rationalisation, and curbs on state spending. The 1992 deficit speaks for
itself.
Despite the gloomy picture, delegates took heart from the prospect of a
fresh start under a technocratic administration. Yet a very different mood
prevailed at the follow-up session in Lagos last month. In the intervening
period the council had fudged one critical hard choice, and blundered in an
area in which it should have expertise. Exchange rate policy was in evident
disarray, illustrated by a Central Bank decision to nullify the results of
one of its foreign exchange auctions on the grounds that bids for the dollar
were 'outrageously' high.
Equally disturbing was the bank's decision to clamp down on open account and
bills for collection trade, freezing more than Dollars 1bn in payments due
to foreign suppliers. Payments for letters of credit were to be deferred
until 90 days after the shipment of goods to Nigeria.
Speaker after speaker criticised the council's performance: 'The Abuja dream
has turned into a nightmare,' complained one industrialist.
Although Mr Shonekan himself displays an indefatigable optimism, the
enormity of the task is starting to weigh down some of his colleagues. 'The
politicians are against us, the civil service is against us, the soldiers
are against us,' concluded a weary senior official.
The politicians do not want to be boxed in by economic reforms which they
see as unpopular with the electorate, he explained. More important, he
suspected that the members of the House of Representatives and Senate,
elected last year, are wary of transparency and accountability which reduce
opportunities for patronage. Similar concerns are shared by the poorly paid
civil service.
Among the military, few officers relish the prospect of civilian overseers.
Nor is the electorate especially enthusiastic, seeing them as the lesser of
two evils. 'The army has been politicised, and politics commercialised,' as
one Nigerian puts it.
The toughest choice facing the council, and central to economic reform is
the need to raise domestic petrol prices. At N0.7 (three US cents) a litre,
smuggling is rife (the pump price in neighbouring Benin is N9.7) and
production costs are not covered. Lost revenue would nearly cover the 1992
budget deficit.
Whatever the economic imperative behind a price rise, the political risk is
enormous. The money would be 'chopped', say Nigerians - meaning it would end
up in politicians' pockets - and trade union leaders and students have
threatened to take to the streets. The decision to increase petrol charges
has been taken in principle; whether it can be implemented remains to be
seen.
What adds to Mr Shonekan's difficulties is the fact that in the time
available he has nothing tangible to offer Nigerians, who have had to endure
a gruelling decade.
Per capita income has fallen from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars
300. The naira, once worth more than a dollar, is worth less than a nickel,
and weakening. External debt has grown by 50 per cent in spite of commercial
debt buy-backs and conversion.
Not surprisingly, while creditors and donors offer Mr Shonekan moral
support, they demand a track record before delivering the carrot - part
write-off, part soft-term rescheduling of Paris Club debt.
An essential precondition to rescheduling is an IMF agreement. Most
observers rule it out in the time available. Even if it were possible, would
it last? The incoming government cannot be tied into an agreement it did not
negotiate. And judging by their comments at the hustings, neither Mr Bashir
Tofa nor Mr Moshood Abiola, the presidential candidates of the National
Republican Convention (NRC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
respectively, seems prepared to pledge continuity in economic reform.
Time is running out on what seasoned observers believe is Nigeria's last
best chance of securing an economic recovery. As one concerned Nigerian put
it: 'If not Shonekan, who? If not now, when?' But it is General Babangida
who ultimately has to make the hard choices, and to do that he must keep his
promises.

THE SUCCESSFUL auction of UK government gilts enlivened Footsie futures,
sending the June contract sharply forward to trade above the 2,900 level for
the first time in recent sessions, writes Joel Kibazo.
A strong advance seemed likely when the June contract on the FT-SE 100
opened at 2,885, up 6 points from the previous day's close. But for a
momentary decline as a leading house came in with a big sell order, June
moved ahead and reached the day's peak of 2,913 in late morning, following
the successful outcome of the gilts auction. The sharp move was also said to
have pulled the cash market higher.
Trading continued at the higher levels for the next few hours before a
combination of profit-taking, the suspension of trading in Queens Moat
Houses and the tentative opening on Wall Street led it to come off the top.
It finished at 2,900, a rise of 21 from the previous close, and 11 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 11 points. Turnover
improved from recent days, reaching 8,961 lots.
Volume in traded options also increased, closing at 25,248, of which 10,532
was in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,207 in the Euro FT-SE. Among stock
options, British Airways traded 1,593 contracts and Barclays followed at
1,286. A trade by Kleinwort Benson in Land Securities just before the market
close saw it end with a total of 1,144 lots dealt.

<TEXT>
Belief that British Petroleum shares have been carried away with the
so-called recovery story triggered a sharp fall in the stock price, which
sharply underperformed the sector and the wider market.
At the close, BP shares were 7 1/2 down at 303 1/2 p on very healthy
turnover of some 11m.
The view that the shares had been overbought during the recent upsurge was
echoed by Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull and one of the
market's biggest bears of BP shares during the past couple of years. 'On a
yield basis the shares are massively overvalued; at the very least they are
a sell down to 250p and there is every justification to sell them down to
200p,' he said.
US investors have been the biggest supporters of BP in recent months,
although Mr Toalster said the rate of increase in the US shareholding in BP
is slowing down. US investors are thought to speak for some 25 per cent of
BP, up from the 23 per cent level at the end of 1992 and the 24 per cent
reached in mid-February.
Lasmo attracted a fresh wave of heavy selling pressure, which drove the
shares down 6 1/2 to 155 1/2 p. Dealers pointed to the substantial level of
activity in the stock - turnover was a hefty 5.1m - and said the recent
series of institutional visits undertaken by the Lasmo board following the
disastrous figures and dividend cut had been badly received.
British Gas touched a record 319p early in the session, but later came off
to close only 2 up at 316 1/2 p as the market began to take the view that
the shares are now fairly valued ahead of the outcome of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission inquiry, expected in around a month's time.
A report from Halifax Building Services, that house sales in February were
higher than at any time during the previous two years, plus the recent sharp
slowing in the rate of company insolvencies, prompted another strong
performance from bank shares.
Abbey National was a big beneficiary of the house sales story, the stock
advancing 4 1/2 to 384 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 5.7m shares. Lloyds, still
well supported on the market view that the bank is well positioned to
increase its dividend at a more rapid rate than its rivals, climbed 9 more
to 544p.
Nervous selling ahead of the April 8 figures saw Sun Alliance drift off 6 to
343p, although most of the insurance stocks tended to lose ground.
Holiday group Airtours fell 6 to 299p as the impact of its failed bid for
Owners Abroad was felt. Airtours sold its stake in its rival at a loss of
more than Pounds 3m on Tuesday. Owners was steady at 124p.
Rothmans International saw its 'B' shares jump 38 to 678p after the tobacco
group announced reorganisation details for its Asian tobacco businesses.
ICI held up against a forecast downgrade from one of its brokers, Hoare
Govett. The house chemicals analyst was unavailable but rival analysts said
Hoare cut by around Pounds 100m to Pounds 630m for this year and by Pounds
150m to Pounds 800m for next year. ICI shares were 8 higher with the market
at 1177p.
The news that international trading group Lonrho had sold its German
property interests helped the shares firm 2 to 82p. US buyers were said to
have favoured Danka Business and the shares jumped 53 to 645p.
UK flag carrier British Airways put on 4 1/2 at 291p after stating that it
was bringing forward the payment of its final dividend, to take account of
the recent changes in UK advance corporation tax that were announced in last
month's Budget.
Renewed caution on Eurotunnel's dispute with Channel tunnel constructor TML
saw the shares surrender 11 to 462p.
Advertising group WPP was firm ahead of tomorrow's call on the Pounds 88m
rights issue. The ordinary stock gained a penny at 56p while the nil-paid
moved ahead 2 to 11 1/2 p.
Textile group William Baird fell 22 to 266p in reaction to the announcement
of 1992 profits. The headline figure of Pounds 23.4m was in line with
forecasts but there was disappointment that the company did not use the new
accounting standards.
Women's wear group House of Lerose leapt 40 to 186p after an agreed Pounds
10.8m bid by clothing retailer Country Casuals, which eased 2 to 167p.
Shares in construction equipment company BM Group gave up 5 to 31p after the
company confirmed a fall in profits and a cut in the dividend as it reported
interim figures. Turnover was fairly high, reaching 5.4m by the close.

FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hambros wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The merchant banking sector was among the market's best performing areas,
led ahead by Hambros, the UK's third biggest merchant bank by market
capitalisation, after SG Warburg and Schroders.
Hambros shares climbed 12 to 335p, with much of yesterday's buying interest
said to have been triggered by a buy note issued by stockbroker Robert
Fleming Securities.
The banks team at Fleming upgraded profits and dividend forecasts, citing
expectations of good underlying growth in the bank, strong recovery in
estate agency profits, the highly successful flotation of Hambros Insurance
Services and the attractive dividend yield, currently at a 30 per cent
premium to the market.
'We have a 1993 target price of 375p, giving 16 per cent upside on the
current share price,' said Fleming. The stockbroker lifted its 1993 profits
estimate from Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m and its 1994 forecast from Pounds 70m
to Pounds 86.5m. The 1994 dividend is expected to rise from 14.5p to 15p.
Other merchant banks also performed well, SG Warburg adding 10 at 635p and
Kleinwort Benson 3 at 386p.

Pharmaceuticals stocks received a much needed lift after a US newspaper
reported that one of President Clinton's senior health aides had 'expressed
distaste' at price curbs on drugs in the US. However, some marketmakers
suggested there might also have been some 'window dressing' to lift prices
on the last day of the first quarter.
Hard-hit Wellcome recovered 23 to 762p, while Glaxo was lifted 18 to 606p.
SmithKline Beecham, which has been talking to analysts in Philadelphia,
gained 15 at 412p in the 'A's and 11 at 359p in the Units. The group
announced that it expected to acquire North American marketing and
distribution rights to a treatment for testosterone deficiencies.

FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hotel sector shaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSPENSION of shares in Queens Moat Houses sent shock waves throughout the
hotel sector and prompted speculation about the group's future. Queens Moat
said it was suspending its shares 'pending clarification of the company's
financial position'.
After the dust had settled, speculation began over which rival companies
might benefit from the situation. Bass was the immediate favourite,
following its recent agreement extending the deal to convert Queens Moat
hotels into Holiday Inns.
While analysts ruled out a full-scale rescue by Bass, some selected
purchases could be made, they thought. Queens Moat now runs 20 Holiday Inns
in Europe. Other names touted included Forte, which has long coveted a major
presence in Europe.
Queens Moat is due to report its final results next week, although analysts
were growing increasingly gloomy as the day wore on that the situation was
so serious that they will have to be postponed.
While the nub of the problem appeared to be a preference dividend payment of
around Pounds 7m, due yesterday, analysts close to the company suggested
that the problem might have occurred as a result of debt restructuring talks
being held with the group's chief lenders. Queens Moat's debts are estimated
at more than Pounds 1bn by leisure specialists, who say the company's
gearing is around 100 per cent.
Queens Moat shares were suspended at 47 1/2 p. Although some cherry-picking
of the assets may benefit selected companies, the fear that a major player
had run into difficulties hit sentiment in the sector. Forte tumbled 9 to
192p, Friendly Hotels 6 to 155p, Ladbroke 4 1/2 to 181p and Rank
Organisation 8 to 655p. Bass shares came off 10p on news of the suspension,
but later recovered with support from a programme trade to finish 3 ahead at
546p.

FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gains trimmed but rally continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMISING attempt to extend the recovery in UK equities, prompted by the
success of the government bond auction, was checked yesterday by the
suspension of trading in shares of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group.
However, late dealings saw the market in good form again, encouraged by
stock index futures, where the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index regained
the 2,900 mark as the last day of the third quarter drew to its close.
The suspension of Queens Moat Houses, 'pending clarification of the
company's financial position', was a serious blow to confidence in a market
now pinning its faith on the prospects of economic recovery. At least three
leading UK securities houses have recommended Queens Moat stock to clients,
and market firms and some banks are likely to suffer losses if next week's
trading statement from the hotel group brings further bad news. Other hotel
and leisure shares gave ground and the rest of the market was severely,
albeit temporarily, shaken.
The bad news on the hotels front temporarily reversed a strong start in the
equity market. Shares opened well, after buying of pharmaceutical stocks
towards the Wall Street close overnight reflected reports that the Clinton
administration might be wavering over restraining drug prices. Concern over
the implications for the pharmaceuticals industry of the Clinton welfare
policies have hurt drug shares.
With some UK houses talking confidently of a 5 to 15 per cent recovery by
the leading drug issues, whose losses have led the London market lower,
Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham moved sharply ahead. However, a
leading London institutional broking house remained bearish on the sector,
and on Glaxo in particular.
The strongest factor behind an early Footsie gain of 25.3 in equities was
the successful outcome of the auction of Pounds 3bn of Treasury 8 per cent
bonds, which passed off significantly better than some had predicted. With
UK bond prices nearly one point higher on the auction news, equities set
aside fears over the government funding programme, for the time being at
least, and advanced strongly.
The day's peak on the Footsie of 2,886.3 came early, however, and was
quickly lost. In the second half of the session the expected New York demand
for drug stocks in London materialised on only a limited scale, and Wall
Street was itself a slow performer, shedding 1.90 Dow points in UK hours.
London traders will watch Wall Street overnight for signs that buyers have
returned for the pharmaceutical leaders.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,878.7, up 17.7 points.
Market strategists perceived this as a successful recovery from the 2,850
range and believed that the 2,900 mark might be tested soon were it not for
the Queens Moat shock. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose 11.5 to 3,107.8 as
investors in the second line stocks took heart at the recovery in the blue
chip issues.
Seaq volume rose to 821.6m shares from Tuesday's 735.8m. Yesterday's total
was swollen by the last of the tax-related deals, including a 112m-share
trade in Ticketing Group, where a large stake changed hands last week.
Non-Footsie business made up around 65 per cent of the day's total.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Turkey recovers after a year on the
downgrade - Istanbul's equity showing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling real interest rates, coupled with better than expected corporate
results, are beginning to lay the foundations for a sustained recovery in
Turkish stocks.
In the first two months of 1993, after a year in the doldrums, the Instanbul
stock exchange rose by 40.6 per cent in dollar terms, topping the list of
emerging markets covered by the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation. This week, in the wake of the Bayram holiday following the
Moslem month of fasting, the index resumed its upward trend, closing
yesterday at 5,864.17 following a record high of 6,091 on February 24. In
spite of a disappointing public response to a recent offering of state-owned
shares, daily trading volume has risen from a low of TL79bn in November to
TL380bn yesterday. The market's equity capitalisation reached USDollars
13bn,up from USDollars 9.5bn four months ago. Brokers say that 1992
corporate profits have been 'well ahead' of inflation. Brewers such as Turk
Tuborg, the large cement concerns, and the auto and retail sectors have all
seen sharp improvements in reported earnings. Investor confidence has been
bolstered by the central bank's decision to slow down the devaluation of the
lira, apparently in anticipation of heavy foreign debt repayments by the
government. Inflation, too, the principal reason why foreign investors
stayed away from the Turkish market, fell to 58 per cent in February,
compared with more than 70 per cent a year earlier.
The exchange is starting to feel the full impact of recent legislative
reforms. The state-owned Isbank, Turkey's largest bank, has announced plans
to switch part of its investment portfolio out of government securities and
into equities, taking advantage of tax exemptions now being offered to
institutions investing 25 per cent of their portfolios in the stock
exchange. Other banks are expected to follow.
Paradoxically, the banks, traditionally one of the best performing sectors,
have seen profits reduced as a result of the withdrawal of tax incentives
for holders of treasury paper. Akbank, Turkey's private bank, reported its
first ever fall in profits after incurring an excessive 140 per cent
increase in its 1992 tax charge.
But perhaps the biggest fillip to equities has been the steady decline in
interest rates, hitherto the main competition for savers. In Turkey,
one-year paper is still considered long term. However, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the
economics minister, is now bidding to extend the maturity of government debt
in an effort to pull down short term rates to give a spur to investment and
allow the government to restructure its own internal debt. Much will depend
on the government's ability to curb its appetite for funds, traditionally
the main reason for Turkey's high real interest rates.
Government securities still account for around 90 per cent of capital market
activities. In contrast, the exchange lists just 146 companies; a much
smaller number are actively traded.
Market activity will continue to be constrained without an increase in
liquidity. The trend of public offerings of privately owned concerns, which
might ease the liquidity problems, has all but dried up. In 1992, there were
just 13 new issues, compared with 24 in 1991. In the first three months of
this year, there has only been one new issue - Netas, the local subsidiary
of Northern Telecom, of Canada, which came to the market earlier this month
after the government sold part of its stake to the public.
The Netas flotation underlines the real problems faced by a programme of
widening share ownership through privatisation. The privatisation agency
received applications for just a third of the 20 per cent stake on offer.
When they came to be traded, Netas shares opened at a discount to the issue
price.
Wryly commenting on the fiasco, Mr Ustun Sanver, head of the government's
privatisation agency, said he had failed to realise 'just quite how small
Turkey's small investors were'.
In addition, the first hints of the aggressive takeover culture familiar to
more developed markets has done little to encourage the large family
conglomerates to float shares.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Wave of profit-taking
sends Nikkei down 2%

PROFIT-TAKERS took their cue from a rise in the yen against the dollar and
the Nikkei average lost 2 per cent, disappointing investors who had expected
the market to rise on the last day of the financial year, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 371.71 to 18,591.45. After initial weakness, it had
rebounded on strong buying by dealers and individuals, hitting the day's
high of 19,059.53 in the morning. However, it dropped to a low of 18,550.89
in late trading.
Volume totalled 700m shares, against Tuesday's 619m. Declines led advances
by 749 to 314, with 119 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 20.67 to 1,431.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 1.34 to 1,134.58.
While some investors expected year-end window dressing to support share
prices, aggressive profit-taking by investment trusts, and arbitrage
selling, reversed early gains. Most life insurers and financial institutions
are still looking to fix profits on stockholdings, and one analyst warned
that there may be more profit-taking at the beginning of the financial year
which starts today.
The market should focus on the restorative fiscal package expected before Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, goes to Washington this month. Mr
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy
research council, yesterday reiterated his calls for a package larger than
the Y10,700bn programme adopted last August.
However, a Finance Ministry official said figures which have been floated by
politicians were unrealistic, and the new programme could be smaller than
last year's package.
High-technology exporters were hurt by the fall in the dollar, which closed
Y1.43 down against the yen at Y115.35. Toshiba lost Y27 to Y652 and Sony
Y160 to Y4,430.
Banks were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y60 to
Y2,460 and Mitsubishi Bank Y40 to Y2,360.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y2,000 at Y877,000, after touching
Y903,000 on buying by individuals and dealers. Other telecom-related issues
were strong, with Furukawa Electric up Y18 at Y648 and Fujikura ahead Y7 at
Y845.
Gold-related issues advanced in anticipation of a rise in gold prices in
overseas markets. Mitsui Mining and Smelting was the most active issue of
the day, climbing Y13 to Y498, and Sumitomo Metal Mining put on Y42 at Y755.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 248.03 to 20,140.11 in volume of 31.1m
shares.
Roundup
MANY Pacific Rim markets were easier but Taiwan provided one firm spot.
TAIWAN shrugged off the consolidation of recent weeks and share prices rose
to a 12-month high in heavy trading. The weighted index ended 74.59, or 1.6
per cent, up at 4,825.29 in TDollars 79.87bn turnover.
The market's optimistic mood has been helped by encouraging economic
indicators and corporate profits, and the announcement that Formosa Plastics
would soon build its USDollars 7.5bn naphtha cracker. There are also
expectations that the central bank will soon loosen curbs on bank lending to
corporations and lift its ban on unsecured loans for purchases of property.
Most sectors posted solid gains and financials rose strongly on continued
interest in the medium business banks, which are expected to benefit from a
Finance Ministry plan to let them expand operations into other cities.
Taichung Bank closed the day's limit up at TDollars 117.50.
The plastics sector, which surged in the previous few days, ran out of steam
and Formosa Plastics retreated 30 cents to TDollars 45.20.
HONG KONG finished easier but off its lows as bargain hunters moved in
shortly before the close. The Hang Seng index dipped 17.63 to 6,388.86 in
HKDollars 3.06bn turnover. Jardine Matheson, vulnerable to a falling market
after being the subject of criticism by Chinese officials recently, declined
HKDollars 1.25, or 2.6 per cent, to HKDollars 46.50.
AUSTRALIA wilted on the last day of March futures trading, in spite of
strong gold prices, and the All Ordinaries index gave up 10.8 to 1,667.4.
BANGKOK picked up in late trade on rumours that the Securities and Exchange
Commission would impose only light penalties, and not jail sentences, on
pending share manipulation cases. The SET index rose 16.03 to 865.23.
BOMBAY recovered on institutional buying, the BSE index putting on 68.69 at
2,271.47.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses muted as rate hopes
subside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW points shaved off the German repo rate, and a notice of no press
briefing after today's Bundesbank meeting left most bourses muted, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS turned slightly lower after six straight rises although, said Lehman
Brothers in London, it got a late uptick from the futures expiry in the
afternoon, which inflated turnover to a maintained FFr3.9bn.
Individual features included Schneider, the electrical engineering and
construction group, down FFr30 or 4.1 per cent to FFr700 on a story that it
might be absorbed into its parent company, SPEP.
Anglo-French hybrids stayed in the news, positive results from Carnaud Metal
Box, the packaging group, leaving the shares FFr2.50 higher at FFr217.30,
but Eurotunnel down another FFr1.35 to FFr38.10 for a two-day loss of 7.6
per cent following reports of further problems in rolling stock production.
FRANKFURT finished with the DAX index 0.86 lower on the day, but 9 per cent
higher over the first three months of 1993 at 1,684.21. Turnover eased from
DM6.1bn to DM5.8bn.
One or two of the days winners and losers reversed their first quarter
trends. Volkswagen, which revealed first quarter losses but hopes to break
even in 1993, fell DM5.90 to DM306 but stayed 26.3 per cent ahead over the
first three months as a whole; Metallgesellschaft, however, rose DM3.40 to
DM316.90 and still showed a three-month loss of 5 per cent.
Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, who produced the quarterly
digest of the DAX constituents' share price performance, noted that this
year's six top performers include strange bedfellows, with VW at the top of
the list joined by Daimler and BASF in third and fourth place - cyclicals
all - with the interest rate-sensitives, Commerzbank, Dresdner and Allianz
in the other three positions.
Deutsche Bank, which help stabilise the market yesterday with solid 1992
results and good expectations for 1993, rose DM2.90 to DM713.50.
MILAN was in calmer mood after Tuesday's events with investors awaiting an
indication of the broadly-based government which the president, Mr Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, might be able to stitch together.
The Comit index edged 1.90 lower to 475.01. Continuing worries that the
privatisation programme faced delays left Credito Italiano L30 lower at
L2,550 before recovering to L2,565 after hours.
Fiat settled L101 lower at L5,799, before recovering to L5,850 after hours
on the view that the arrival of the new French government could soon clear
the way for the much-rumoured deal with Renault.
Against the trend, La Rinascente, the country's biggest retailer, rose L254
or 3.2 per cent to L8,170 on its better than expected 1992 earnings.
AMSTERDAM was firmer, benefiting from foreign demand, and the CBS Tendency
index added 0.40 to 107.70. Philips added Fl 1.10 to Fl 25 in active trade
after a newspaper report that it was discussing a common standard for
multimedia products with IBM and Apple of the US.
Concern that the government might tax income from capital growth investment
funds continued to provoke a switch into blue chips. ABN Amro's Obligatie
Groeifonds dipped 20 cents to Fl 193.40 with more than 1m shares traded.
Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group rose Fl 1 to Fl 31.10 in active
trading amid rumours that large investors were building stakes.
Aegon, the insurer, firmed 60 cents to Fl 88.80 ahead of today's results,
with analysts looking for a rise in net profits of up to 15 per cent.
ZURICH was steady although business thinned as the day progressed amid
uncertainty over the prospects for further interest rate cuts and end of
quarter book squaring operations. The SMI index remained at a record high
for the second consecutive day, rising 1.0 to 2,190.3.
VIENNA dropped 1.6 per cent, the ATX index losing 12.99 to 778.69 as traders
said that the market was technically weak, that interest in shares was poor,
volumes were low, and banks were passing shares back and forth like 'hot
potatoes'.
Among ATX shares the day's biggest faller was OMV, the oil company, down
Sch18 at Sch583 after the US again called for a UN oil embargo against
Libya, where OMV has upstream interests.
DUBLIN continued ahead with foreign buying helping the ISEQ overall index
37.23 or 2.5 per cent higher to 1,517.96. Analysts attributed the strong
performance to expectations of lower interest rates and good corporate
results.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Options-related sales weaken
blue chips
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
IN SPITE OF an early rally in drug stocks, prompted by reports that the
Clinton administration is not considering placing controls on pharmaceutical
prices, US equities ended mixed yesterday but with blue chips hit hard by
late options-related selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.16 down at 3,435.11, its low for
the day. Other indices fared better. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased only
0.30 to 451.67, while the American SE composite finished 3.75 firmer at
423.43 and the Nasdaq composite 3.88 higher at 690.13. New York SE volume
was 279m shares.
The day's economic news had little impact on the markets. Among the data
released was a 0.5 per cent rise in leading economic indicators for February
and a 1.4 per cent increase in February factory orders, both of which were
in line with analysts' forecasts. News of a stronger than expected Chicago
purchasing managers' report also had no effect on sentiment.
Investors have ignored most of the recent data because their attention is
firmly fixed on tomorrow's all-important employment report for March, which
will give the latest indication of how the labour market is responding to
the growth in business activity.
Prices traded slightly firmer throughout the day, except for Dow stocks,
which dropped more than 20 points in the final hour of trading, with dealers
saying this was related to the expiration of new stock index options
products.
Drug shares were the feature of the day as they continued the rally sparked
late on Tuesday by comments from Mr Ira Magaziner, a senior adviser to
President Clinton, who doubted that the administration would pursue price
controls as part of its healthcare industry reform package.
Since the middle of last year, when Mr Clinton became firm favourite to win
the election, drug issues have been hounded by speculation that limits would
be placed on drug prices in an attempt by the government to keep medical
costs down.
After some delays because of order imbalances, most of the big drug stocks
posted gains of more than Dollars 1 in early trading, which was described by
traders as primarily a follow-through from the heavy buying on European
markets. By the close, however, the rally had lost most of its steam, with
the bigger stocks hit by the options-related selling.
Merck finished down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 35 3/8 after volume of 5.6m
shares, Pfizer off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 62 1/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 59. Among those that managed to hold on to
most of their gains were Johnson &amp; Johnson, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 42
1/2 , Foundation Health, Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 30, and US Surgical,
Dollars 1 firmer at Dollars 57 1/2 , all after busy trading.
Wal-Mart, hit hard by a broker's downgrade on Tuesday, bounced back, rising
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 in volume of 6.8m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, medical stocks also gained ground. Amgen rose Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 37 3/4 and US Healthcare put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46
1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO closed higher after active trading, boosted by strong gains in
pipelines and gold shares.
The TSE 300 index improved 16.3 to 3,602.4 and advances outpaced declines by
428 to 280 after volume of 57.4m shares valued at CDollars 565.7m.

FT  01 APR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS slightly duller sentiment about a near-term cut in UK base rates
yesterday after the governor of the Bank of England said he would like to
see a stronger sterling exchange rate, writes James Blitz.
In previous days, tensions between the UK government and Britain's building
societies had raised speculation that the government might come under
pressure to reduce base rates.
However, Mr Robin Leigh- Pemberton's comments at a meeting of British MPs
yesterday reinforced the view that the authorities were disinclined to cut
rates again, on the basis that a modest recovery might already have started.
The governor's comment that Britain should pursue a policy of stable
interest rates triggered a small sell-off in short-dated futures. The June
contract fell 8 basis points from its previous close of 94.28, while the
September contract declined 5 basis points to 94.40.
The sterling cash market was a good deal quieter. Three-month money finished
little changed at 5 15/16 per cent, and the Bank of England forecast a
shortage of Pounds 650m, which was easily removed.
In Germany, Euromark futures fell back after the lowest accepted rate in the
Bundesbank's repo was cut by 8 basis points to 8.17 per cent. Some dealers
had been expecting the repo to be cut to 8.10 per cent.
The June Euromark contract ended 8 basis points down at 92.83, while the
March contract slipped 6 basis points to close at 93.68.
In the cash market, call money fell very sharply in a market that was
over-provided with liquidity at the month-end. Banks' reserves at the
month-end were so far above the Bundesbank's new requirements that call
money was quoted in a range of 1 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Several money market dealers said they did not expect any change in the
Bundesbank's officially posted interest rates at today's meeting of its
policy-making council. It is only two weeks since the Bundesbank reduced its
discount rate by 50 basis points to 7.50 per cent.
However, there were strong expectations that the Bank of France would lower
its intervention rate today in the wake of the franc's stronger than
expected performance since the new French government was nominated.

FT  01 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Governor pushes up sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING was boosted against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday after
the governor of the Bank of England said he was not seeking lower interest
rates and the UK authorities held a successful auction of government bonds,
writes James Blitz.
The pound had weakened to about DM2.4100 by the start of London trading but
finished at DM2.4275, leaving a rise of  1/2 pfennig on the day. Its
performance against a weak dollar was as strong, with the UK currency
piercing the important resistance level of Dollars 1.4980 and closing at
Dollars 1.5055, up  3/4 cent on the day. In New York it finished at Dollars
1.5140.
Several factors lifted the pound in an otherwise quiet market. Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, said he would like to see a
stronger exchange rate for the currency and that Britain should pursue a
policy of stable exchange rates. Most of the pound's move upwards took place
while he was giving evidence to British MPs.
Sterling also strengthened after the government's auction of Pounds 3bn of
20-year gilts - the largest gilt auction ever - went successfully. The
auction was covered 1.96 times and gilts rose a full percentage point.
Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Panmure Gordon in London, said the
success of the auction should push the pound higher. 'We have had a major
focus of attention on this auction and it went well,' he added. 'Sterling
should now be the flavour of the month.'
One measure of the pound's strength was that it rose in spite of a more
modest easing in the Bundesbank's money market tender rate than had been
expected.
The Bundesbank's repo rate dropped 8 basis points to 8.17 per cent, while
some dealers had been expecting the repo to be cut down to 8.10 per cent.
The modest repo rate cut was one reason behind another weakening in the
dollar, which fell as low as DM1.6065 in European trading and closed a net
3/4 pfennig down at DM1.6125. The dollar also hit another all-time low
against the yen, sinking to Y114.55 before finishing at Y114.90. In New York
the US unit ended at DM1.6069 and Y114.78.
The dollar's weakness against the yen was partly due to the end of the
Japanese fiscal year yesterday, which always gives the US currency problems.
However, the dollar could be undermined further by the perception that the
US economic upturn in the first quarter of this year has not proved as
strong as the one in the last three months of 1992. US leading indicators
for February, issued yesterday, rose 0.5 per cent when market forecasts had
been for an increase of 0.6 per cent.
The Italian lira took a breather yesterday after two disturbing days,
closing stronger at L989.7 to the D-Mark from a previous L990.1. The French
franc eased back a few notches in late European trading but closed unchanged
on the day at FFr3.396.

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kazakhstan sets export goals
for metals sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAZAKHSTAN, which exported virtually no metal when it was part of the former
Soviet Union, has set 1993 export quotas for zinc, lead and copper at 90,000
tonnes, 70,000 tonnes and 120,000 tonnes respectively, according to a report
from the Brook Hunt &amp; Associates UK consulting group in association with the
Kazakhstan International Metal Exchange.
Brook Hunt estimates that last year 220,000 tonnes of Kazakh copper was
shipped to the west while 145,000 tonnes went to the Ukraine, some of which
also found its way to the west. Refined lead exports were about 80,000
tonnes and shipments of zinc were 'rather less.'
The report suggests that Kazakhstan's metals trade 'degenerated into an
unregulated free-for-all' but steps are being taken to put control of export
sales in the hands of a central government organisation. 'This will not mean
that the overall volume of shipments will necessarily fall,' it says,
however.
It adds: 'Domestic manufacturing capability is extremely limited and there
are few other goods that can earn hard currency.'
A team from Brook Hunt and personnel from the Kazakhstan Metal Exchange
visited the principal mining and metallurgical operations of the central
Asia republic, a land-locked country which covers an area six times the size
of France, and discovered that 'the fate of domestic, non-integrated miners
(the majority) has been virtually ignored.
'They have been deprived of development capital and have continued to be
paid in roubles, at prices reflecting internal costs, for concentrates sold
to the smelters.'
This has caused an acute shortage of raw material from domestic sources for
Kazakh smelters which are increasingly relying on imported feed.
The report says annual mine output of copper is about 302,000 tonnes
compared with refined copper production capacity of 570,000 tonnes and
actual production of 370,000 tonnes.
Mine lead production is 105,000 tonnes compared with refined capacity of
420,000 tonnes and refined output of 282,000 tonnes. The figures for zinc
are 266,000 tonnes of mine production, 380,000 tonnes of refined capacity
and 272,000 tonnes of refined output.
Brook Hunt suggests that some of the proceeds from metals sales to the west
should be invested in improving Kazakhstan's domestic mine capability.
'There are some new deposits which appear to have favourable grades and
several are already part-developed but the local combines do not have the
funds at this stage to proceed further. Foreign companies are being invited
to participate in these projects.'
It also says that mining and metallurgical industries should diversify into
labour-intensive industries producing consumer goods to satisfy demand in
the central Asian republics. At present there are no alternative jobs
available for workers displaced from the mining and metals industries,
particularly in remote centres such as Balkhash and Dzhezkazgan.
The report adds: 'It is considered that society (in Kazakhstan) would not be
prepared to accept the concept of unemployment and it is unlikely that
government could afford to introduce a social security system to deal with
large numbers of unemployed.'

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moscow's gold reserves now at
320 tonnes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR YEVGENY Bychkov, head of Russia's Precious Metals and Stones Committee,
said yesterday that the country's official gold reserves consisted of 150
tonnes held by the central bank and 170 tonnes with his committee.
This figure compares with the rock bottom level revealed about one year and
a half ago of 240 tonnes.
In an interview with the Financial Times, covering diamonds as well as gold,
he also said he would be urging improvements in Russia's relationship with
De Beers in talks to be held in Moscow today.
Finally, he suggested that Star Technology Systems, an Australian company
which has set up a joint stock company with Lenzoloto, a state-owned
Siberian gold producer, was unlikely to be allowed to exploit Russia's
biggest hard rock gold deposit.
The joint stock company, Lena Gold, has been approved by the State Property
Committee. It is now waiting for the Russian government to declassify secret
information about the Sukhoi Log deposit's reserves so that it can pay the
first Dollars 20m instalment of its Dollars 250m investment.
Mr Bychkov said, however, that he and the State Geology Committee were
preparing a new draft decree which, if approved by the government, would
exclude foreign companies from the development of the Sukhoi Log deposit,
organise a tender for Russian companies, and commit the government to cover
some of the costs.
'We have dozens of other gold deposits which can be exploited by foreign
companies. But this one must be exploited by ourselves,' he said.
Mr Bycchkov claimed that Lena Gold had not fulfilled conditions set by the
government for the Australians to take part in the development of Sukhoi
Log.
Apart from Mr Bychkov's objections, Star faces claims from the State Geology
Committee that Lena Gold has not fulfilled the conditions for a licence to
exploit Sukhoi Log to be confirmed by the committee. Nor has Lena Gold
sought to do so, arguing that documents have been confirmed by local
authorities.
Controversy also continues to emerge from Russia's relationship with another
foreign company, De Beers. Mr Bychkov said he was intent on bargaining to
improve the terms of a five-year contract, signed in 1990 with the Soviet
Union and renewed by Russia, whereby 95 per cent of Russian exports of rough
diamonds have to go through De Beers.
But Mr Sergei Ulin, a director of Almazy Rossii-Sakha, the state-owned
company which runs the diamond industry and is in charge of relations with
De Beers, said that evaluations had not found the agreement to be
'non-beneficial to our national interests'.
He said that Russia could increase prices fetched for its diamonds by
improving the efficiency of its diamond polishing industry, adjusting output
volumes according to varying international demand, and preventing smuggling.

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals up again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRECIOUS metals price revival continued yesterday and continued to keep
market participants in a high state of excitement. Gold at one stage moved
above Dollars 340 a troy ounce but the price eased back to close in London
at Dollars 337.80, up Dollars 1.70. This caused some dealers to suggest the
rally was running out of steam.
Silver and platinum once again followed gold's rise. Silver closed in London
last night at Dollars 3.895.
The American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation, suggested in
its latest MetalsFax: 'In my view only a new wave of big sales can keep gold
prices down.'
In the near term, though, the market might have to absorb more metal from
North American producers, some of whom had hedged little gold so far this
year. But 'apart from some increased producer selling which so far is of
manageable proportions, there no longer appears to be a big influx of metal
to the market.'
Mr Nichols said he was encouraged by the recent interest of institutional
and substantial private investors in the gold share market. 'Retail (gold)
investment activity in America and Europe - judging by demand for bullion
coins and small bars - is showing renewed signs of life,' he added.
Dealers said that there was some producer selling, profit-taking and light
selling by Middle East investors when gold approached Dollars 340 an ounce
yesterday.
One chartist pointed out that gold, silver and platinum all broke through
their 200-day averages yesterday. 'In technical terms that is orgasmic,' he
added.

ZINC came under late pressure on the LME, with three-month metal pushed
below the psychological support level of Dollars 1,000 a tonne, although
sell stops were not triggered. Underlying producer support might cushion
falls, but the bearish fundamental picture of rising stocks might see prices
testing contract lows of Dollars 987, dealers said. COPPER prices were
steadier. The market was helped by expectations of support below Dollars
2,160 a tonne, although stiff resistance around Dollars 2,170 prevented any
further upside movement. ALUMINIUM was consolidating after Tuesday's decline
to 14 1/2 -month lows. Some consumer interest was seen above Dollars 1,140 a
tonne for three-month metal. Copper's stability was also supportive. NICKEL
eased back from midsession highs, as recent gains attracted profit-taking,
although the market remained firmer after investment fund interest. New York
raw SUGAR was mixed at midday after opening lower on profit taking. But
traders said tighter global supplies, expectations for sharply lower Cuban
output and bullish technical factors were pointing to higher prices ahead
and had deterred aggressive selling.

CRISIS CONDITIONS in the wool market were underlined this week when the
Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator continued its steady fall,
beyond the low point reached when free market trade was first resumed in
February 1991. In real terms these are the lowest prices ever recorded. Weak
markets enhance the effects of recession and the indefinite absence of the
old Soviet Union countries. A prominent leader in the French wool textile
industry and director of the International Wool Secretariat has outspokenly
suggested that the stockpile in Australia should be destroyed, as the only
way to allow prices to rise.

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US grain sales to Russia eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER SUBTLE adjustment in US Department of Agriculture credit guarantee
policy this week will allow more grain to be shipped to Russia during the
next few months.
The action seems to be part of a programme to warm up US export channels
that froze when the former Soviet Union stopped making interest payments on
its US-backed grain loans four months ago.
The move comes before President Clinton's meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin this weekend. Grain traders expect the US to produce a new aid
package at that meeting facilitating additional grain shipments to Russia.
The USDA amended its credit guarantees to exporters so that 600,000 tonnes
of US maize and - sold before interest payments on US-backed loans stopped
in late November - could be shipped.
Banks had been reluctant to issue letters of credit to back the
USDA-registered sales for fear of incurring non-guaranteed risk.
Without the letters, exporters were unable to deliver the grain. The USDA
amendments will move the grain, but increases the agency's exposure to
Russia's grain defaults, which are expected to reach Dollars 1 bn by June.
The restored sales, which are worth about Dollars 250m, and this month's
massive US food donations will keep grain flowing to Russia while the
Clinton administration and G7 policy makers review debt rescheduling
options.
During March, the US announced donations of 520,000 tonnes of wheat, 210,000
of corn, and 87,000 of rice. An cash sale to Russia of 120,000 tonnes of
soyameal, made last week, will also enter shipping channels soon.
Separately, Canada is arranging barter sales of its feed wheat to Russia.
Canada suspended grain sales to the the Soviet Union in September when it
fell behind on its Dollars 1.5 bn credit line with the Canadian Wheat Board.
All of this was bullish news to farmers who would like to see the US-Russian
grain trade normalised. But prices for next year's maize and soyabean crops
were lower after the USDA announcement, while wheat prices received only a
minor boost.

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber accord verging on
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNLESS THERE are some last minute negotiations, today could go down as the
day which saw the beginning of the end for the International Natural Rubber
Agreement (Inra).
Inra - agreed between the world's main natural rubber producers and
consumers - has been in force since the late 1970s. It now seems that
differences between the two groups can no longer be reconciled.
Arguments over pricing are at the centre of the argument. Inra members -
Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast -
accounting for more than 80 per cent of the world's natural rubber output
say that the present agreement,
Inra II has failed to lift prices to levels which give plantations and
hundreds of thousands of rubber smallholders an adequate income.
Producers and consumers - mainly the EC, US and Japan - agreed last November
on a deadline of yesterday for any move towards some form of renegotiation
of Inra II. If the consumers did not agree, said the producers, then Inra
would be allowed to lapse and the producers themselves could bring in their
own pricing mechanisms.
Earlier this week the EC issued a statement saying it was unwilling to
renegotiate Inra II. The EC accused the producers of failing to abide by
price review provisions laid down in the existing pact.
The EC said, however, that it would consider the question of renegotiation
'once the present situation has been corrected.'
The US and Japan have also rejected any renegotiation.
Inra falls under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber
Organisation (Inro). Its rules make any renegotiation impossible unless the
big consumers first agree.
Producers have reacted angrily to the EC statement. Mr Ahmad Farouk, the
producers spokesman, said the EC was the one who was breaking the agreement.
Inra II expires at the end of this year but it can be extended for a further
two year period by mutual agreement between producers and consumers.
Mr Ahmad rejects such a move. 'How can you have an extension if there is no
renegotiation?' he said.
Producers also dismissed the EC's criticism concerning a planned price
review earlier this year. An Inro council meeting in February ended without
agreement on whether to cut the group's reference which is used to guide
market intervention by the Inro buffer stock manager.
Consumer led by the EC wanted the reference price cut but were opposed by
Malaysia and other producers which had been benefiting from a temporary
rally in rubber prices.
'Consumers are always finding excuses not to renegotiate the Inra' said an
official from Thailand, now the world's biggest natural rubber producer.
Inro is likely to make an announcement on the future of Inra within the next
few days. The next Inro council meeting is scheduled to take place here at
the end of May.

FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee pact talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON an international coffee agreement with market support measures
collapsed yesterday evening in London.
'There is no more time and no more space to reach a compromise,' said Mr
Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of the International Coffee Organisation committee
which had been specially set up to look for any areas of agreement between
producers and consumers.
Yesterday was the deadline set by delegates to negotiate an agreement to
replace the current pact, which expires at the end of September.
The full ICO Council was meeting late into last night. However, Mr Lopez
said it was unlikely that the council would be making any decisions last
night on the ICO's future, but it would decide to reconvene soon. Options
before it include the establishment of a purely administrative agreement
such as is run by the International Sugar Organisation.
World coffee markets have already discounted the latest talks, which were
not expected to succeed. London robusta prices closed higher yesterday just
before the news, and New York arabicas were up by well over 1 cent a lb in
early trading.
However, prices are less than half the 120 cents a lb of July 1989, when the
ICO export quota system collapsed. Producers are estimated to have lost more
than Dollars 10bn in revenues since then.
Mr Valdemar Leao, from the Brazilian delegation, said that producers had got
as close as they could to the consumer position.
However, he complained: 'They did not move. In the last 12 months the only
items we have agreed were when we agreed with the consumers. The pace of the
negotiations was impossible. We have agreed on three articles and we need
agreement on 71.'
At the end of the last talks in February Brazil, the largest producer,
obliquely blamed the US, the biggest consumer, for the deadlock. In the
ensuing weeks producers have lobbied the new US administration intensively.
Early yesterday evening the consumers would make no comment on the collapse
until they had agreed a common position. But one producer delegate said that
the consumers had played their hand very badly. 'They were playing for an
extension - they are rather shocked that they did not get it.'
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said the
attitude of consuming countries towards commodity agreements as a form of
aid for developing countries had changed. But he predicted a backlash. 'The
US will be surprised at the amount of flak it has to take over this,' he
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SURGING demand for the shares of resource companies helped push trading on
the Toronto stock exchange to record levels in March.
The TSE, which is second only to New York in trading volume in North
America, said yesterday that 1.24bn shares changed hands in the first 30
days of last month, up 28 per cent from February and double the volume of
March 1993.
Trading values were set to reach about CDollars 12bn (USDollars 9.6bn) for
March as a whole, almost double the levels of a year earlier.
At the close yesterday, the TSE 300 index stood at 3,602, a gain of more
than 7 per cent so far this year, but still well below its August 1987
record of 4,112.
Like other North American exchanges, Toronto has benefited from the shift
from fixed-income to equity investments as the slide in interest rates
appears to be nearing an end. But investors have also been attracted to the
resource-based Canadian market by signs of an upturn in commodity prices.
Mr Greg Mills, head of liabilities trading at Burns Fry, a Toronto-based
securities firm, said that 'a lot of the stocks people are looking to buy
right now are commodity-based cyclicals.'
Timber producers have performed especially well this year as North American
lumber prices soared to record levels. Canadian gold mining shares have
risen sharply in recent days, reflecting higher bullion prices.

FT  01 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthen on success of Bank's
Pounds 3bn auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds surged by over a point yesterday on news that the Bank
of England's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year gilts - the biggest-ever auction
of UK government stock and the first in the government's new programme of
gilt issuance - had been well-received.
The strong rally prompted the Bank to take advantage of the favourable
market conditions by announcing a further Pounds 600m of 8 per cent stock
due 2003 available for sale with effect from today.
Gilt-edged marketmakers described the Bank of England's auction of the 8 per
cent gilt due 2013 as a 'big success', pointing to the relatively high cover
of 1.96 and the lack of a 'tail'.
The 'cover' is the ratio of bids to the amount of stock on offer, so a high
cover suggests that demand from dealers and investors was strong. The 'tail'
at an auction is the difference between the average accepted yield and the
highest accepted yield. The Bank said both the average and the highest
accepted yield were 8.53 per cent at yesterday's auction. The lowest
accepted yield was 8.52 per cent.
'The auction result exceeded people's wildest dreams,' said Mr Chris
Anthony, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Long-dated gilt prices gained a point on the auction announcement and
remained firm during the afternoon. The Liffe gilt future rose from 105.07
to a high of 106.17 in heavy trading before ending at around 106.13.
Ten-year gilts gained about half a point, while short-dated issues
underperformed the rest of the market as hopes of an imminent cut in the
base rate faded. As a result, the gilt yield curve flattened yesterday.
Gilt-edged marketmakers said demand at yesterday's auction came mainly from
domestic institutions, although they noted some foreign buying interest too.
The market had been particularly anxious about the auction, as it is the
first one to take place in the Bank of England's new funding programme of
bigger and more frequent auctions.
GERMAN government bonds ended lower on the day, reflecting market
disappointment at the Bundesbank's small cut in the repo rate yesterday.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM84.6bn in its tender, and cut the lowest
allocated rate for 13-day funds to 8.17 per cent from 8.25 per cent at the
previous week's repo. The central bank drained a net amount of DM13.8bn from
the market. Dealers said the market had hoped for a larger decline in the
repo rate.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.58, and climbed to a high of
95.68 early in the trading session, but drifted lower in the course of the
day to end at around 95.38.
US Treasury prices weakened in thin trading yesterday as investors chose to
stay on the sidelines before tomorrow's important employment figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 102
1/2 , yielding 6.922 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also lower, down  1/8 at 99 13/16 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
Dealers put the modest declines down to the Chicago purchasing managers'
February manufacturing and employment indices, which came in stronger than
expected.
The market ignored news of a 1.4 per cent rise in February factory orders
and a 0.5 per cent rise in the February leading indicators, increases that
were in line with expectations.
The day's data aside, investors' attention remained fixed on the
all-important jobs report for March, which will be released tomorrow.
Analysts are expecting the figures to show a 100,000 increase in non-farm
payrolls.
THE combination of a strong yen and stock market weakness in Tokyo helped to
push up Japanese government bond prices yesterday morning, although the
market later fell back to close lower on the day on hedge-selling by
dealers.
The yen strengthened against the dollar during Tokyo trading, prompting the
futures contract to rise from its opening price of 108.65 to a high of
108.86. However, bond prices later weakened on hedge-selling after the
monthly government bond auction, and the futures contract ended Tokyo
trading at 108.51.
The futures contract picked up again in London trading, reaching 108.81 as
the yen appreciated against the dollar.
The ministry of finance auctioned Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a coupon of
4.5 per cent, up from 4.2 per cent at the previous auction. This marks the
first time that the coupon has been raised in nearly a year. The 10-year
bonds were auctioned at an average yield of 4.458 per cent.
In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 issue yield opened at 4.2 per cent,
moved in a range of 4.185 to 4.220 per cent, and ended at 4.22 per cent.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Repsol sets offer price at

A STRONG demand for Repsol equity has allowed the Spanish energy group to
waive a discount in its global offering to institutional investors and set a
price of Pta2,735 (Dollars 23.68) a share, its closing share price on
Tuesday on the Madrid stock exchange.
The issue is likely to be one of the largest this year to be aimed at
international institutions, and will realise Pta110bn.
Repsol will be issuing 40m shares, which is the maximum amount of equity
that it was authorised to offer by the government. The book-building
process, in which Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as global
co-ordinator with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as joint co-ordinator, reportedly
indicated a demand for 70m shares.
Repsol said a total of 35m shares had been allocated to the five tranches of
the offering and that it was issuing a further 5m 'greenshoe', or
over-allotment, shares - 15 per cent of the total offering - in an
over-allocation option in order to stabilise the market.
In the allocation, the US tranche, led by Goldman Sachs, is offering 14.5m
shares and 8.45m shares are being offered in the UK where SG Warburg and
Banco Santander de Negocios are co-lead managers.
The continental European tranche, jointly led by Paribas and Credit Suisse
First Boston, totals 6m shares; the Spanish one, which has Banco Central
Hispano as lead manager, amounts to 4.25m; and the rest of the world
tranche, which is being led by Morgan Stanley, has been allocated 1.8m
shares.
Madrid stockbroking firms FG and Ibersecurities, which had earlier hoped
that Repsol would set the offer price at Pta2,700 a share, yesterday
recommended the shares at their higher price as an attractive long-term buy
with a target of Pta2,900 to Pta3,000.
The global offering represents 13.3 per cent of Repsol's equity and it will
reduce the government's shareholding in the energy group from 54.4 per cent
to 41.1 per cent.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Bonds: Euro-French franc sector springs to
life after polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EURO-FRENCH franc market sprang back into life yesterday following the
National Assembly elections as investors positioned themselves for an
expected fall in French interest rates.
The success of yesterday's issues - from Caisse Autonome de Refinancement
(CAR) and Credit National - was explained in part by the fact that they do
not need to be paid for until the fourth week in April. With fears over the
French currency continuing, such new issues give international investors a
period of exposure to the French bond market without exposure to the
currency, reducing hedging costs.
The CAR's FFr1.8bn, eight-year zero-coupon issue follows a spate of similar
deals in early March from Credit Local, Kingdom of Sweden, KfW and
Electricite de France. Given the hefty discount at which they are priced,
zero-coupon issues help to reduce the carrying cost of a French franc bond
holding at a time of high short-term interest rates.
French overnight interest rates eased yesterday to 10 3/4 per cent, but are
still well above the 7.2 per cent yield on 10-year yield OATs.
Credit National's three-year issue was raised from FFr1bn to FFr1.5bn,
despite a spread of 38 basis points above French government bonds which was
seen as tight given the AA3 rating of the borrower.
The Eurodollar market remained subdued yesterday, marked by the slow take-up
of a Dollars 250m offer from Halifax, the biggest UK building society.
Halifax was tempted into the market by a rise in the three-year USDollars
swap spread, as quoted on screens, from 30 to around 32 basis points.
That enabled it to meet its unspecified borrowing target while issuing bonds
at a spread of 45 basis points over US Treasuries - the same spread as a
recent issue from Abbey National, the former building society which is
widely seen as a similar credit. Abbey's issue had been brought at a spread
of 38 basis points. Halifax's bonds fell slightly later in the day, and were
bid at a spread of 48 basis points over Treasuries.
A successful UK gilt auction yesterday prompted renewed talk in the bond
markets of further Eurosterling bonds in the coming days. However, while
demand among investors remains strongest for long-dated bonds, the swap
market is most attractive in the five-year area, where the spread over gilts
has risen to 50 from 48 basis points in recent days.
That disparity dampened talk of foreign issuers coming to the market, though
UK corporates were thought to be likely borrowers.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Renong earnings climb to
MDollars 95.4m at halfway

THE RENONG group, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, has reported
pre-tax profits of MDollars 95.4m (USDollars 36.7m) in the six months to
December 31 1992. This compares with a pre-tax profit of MDollars 70.7m in
the same period in 1991.
Renong is controlled by interests within the United Malays National
Organisation (Umno) Malaysia's main political party. Renong's interests
range from banking and stockbroking to the property sector, construction -
including some of the country's biggest infrastructure projects - and light
industrials.
While the group described its six-month performance as satisfactory,
analysts say Renong still has considerable structural problems following a
number of company reorganisations over the past two years.
Earlier this year, Renong announced it was selling its entire media
interests, including controlling stakes in The New Straits Times Press
(NSTP), Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group, and in TV3, the
country's only privately-owned TV channel, for MDollars 800m.
Both NSTP and TV3 are believed to have made significant contributions to
Renong's overall performance last year.
United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), a listed company within the Renong group,
has announced pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1992 of MDollars
200.3m. This compares with pre tax profits of 170m in 1991.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Property helps boosts Wharf to
HKDollars 2bn profit

<TEXT>
WHARF, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir
YK Pao, yesterday reported net profits for 1992 of HKDollars 2bn (USDollars
258m), compared with HKDollars 1.28bn for the last nine months of 1991.
The company said that on an annualised basis, profits grew 20 per cent.
However, if extraordinary gains are extracted, the rise would have been 14
per cent.
A final dividend of 48.5 cents a share was declared, making 65 cents for the
year, against 56.5 cents for the previous nine months.
Turnover amounted to HKDollars 4.4bn, compared with HKDollars 2.4bn. Wharf
has interests in property, hotels, infrastructure, and media, but property
development accounted for about 70 per cent of the growth in earnings.
The directors said that in spite of uncertainties in Hong Kong, the
development of the group's land bank would underpin continued growth in
earnings. From now until 1996, it will bring nearly 7m sq feet of
residential and office space to market.
Mr Peter Woo, chairman, said the group's long-term aim was to commit between
10 and 20 per cent of its assets to China, equal at current balance sheet
values to between HKDollars 4.5bn and HKDollars 9bn.
Mr John Hung, an executive director, said Wharf was focusing on five
locations in China: Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Beijing. It
was currently committed to the development of a modern port at Ningpo, the
introduction of pay television into Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and
various property developments in Shanghai.
Mr Hung also said Wharf planned to proceed with the introduction of pay
television in Hong Kong. Its licence, which has yet to receive Chinese
approval, was awarded by the Hong Kong government.
He said the venture would require an initial investment of HKDollars 2bn,
which Wharf would fund internally. After China had given its formal blessing
to the licence it would seek to refinance the investment.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Engen looks unlikely to invest
in fuel project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENGEN, the energy arm of South Africa's Gencor group, yesterday said it was
unlikely to exercise its rights to acquire a 30 per cent stake in the
controversial R12bn (Dollars 3.8bn) Mossgas synthetic fuels project.
Mr Bernard Smith, chairman, said it 'looks as if we will be making a
negative decision on Mossgas'. Engen has until the end of 1993 to decide. He
said the investment did not appear commercially sensible because Mossgas
would not be viable without a considerable state subsidy.
Earnings at Engen, meanwhile, rose by 10 per cent in the first half to the
end of February. However, Mr Rob Angel, managing director, said the results
were not what the company had hoped for. He predicted that Engen would
achieve real earnings growth for the full year.
Turnover rose by 10.4 per cent to R3.56bn from R3.23bn, and operating income
advanced 42 per cent to R270m from R190m thanks to a better wholesale margin
and cost containment.
These gains were offset by a fall in net financing income to R13m from R67m,
leaving net income 10.7 per cent higher at R228m compared with R206m.
Earnings per share rose by 10.1 per cent to 147 cents from 134 cents and the
dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 55 cents a share from 50 cents.
Mr Angel said sales had been flat - below expectations of 3 to 4 per cent
growth. He attributed this to South Africa's economic climate, a hiatus in
the name change from Mobil to Engen and problems with various township
sights.
The refinery, he said, had had a 'very disappointing' first half. Teething
problems following an upgrade were exacerbated by frequent power failures.
Crude volumes through the refinery were thus about 20 per cent below
forecast.

BANK LEUMI, Israel's second-largest bank, yesterday reported a return to the
black with net profits of Shk210.4m (Dollars 76.1m) for 1992, after losing
Shk85.4m in 1991, writes Judy Maltz in Jerusalem.
This turnround was the result of a decrease in the bank's bad debt provision
to Shk573m from Shk900m. A law passed by parliament had forced the bank to
make large write-offs in 1991 for the country's semi-collective farms.
Total assets were Shk78.4bn at the end of 1992, an increase of 6 per cent
from a year earlier.
United Mizrahi Bank, Israel's fourth-largest bank, yesterday posted trebled
net profits of Shk111.5m in 1992 from Shk35.7m the year before.
The main factor behind the rise was a sharp drop in its bad debt provision
to Shk97.3m from Shk182.2m. Its return on equity was 15 per cent.

CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), a New Zealand forestry group, yesterday sold its
remaining 10 per cent interest in Pan Pac Mill, a sawn timber and wood pulp
mill, to its former Japanese joint-venture partners for NZDollars 20m
(USDollars 10.7m), writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The mill, one of the largest in New Zealand, was developed by Carter family
interests in the 1960s as a joint venture with Oji Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku
Pulp.
CHH originally held 60 per cent of the venture. However, in early 1991, when
CHH faced financial problems following its takeover of rival NZ Forest
Products, it agreed to sell 50 per cent of Pan Pac to the Japanese partners
for NZDollars 50m on condition it could buy the holding back on March 31
this year.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Brokers line up for SDollars
10bn telecoms offer - The flotation which launches Singapore's privatisation
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF there's one thing that a Singapore broker craves, it is excitement.
The local corporate scene is dominated by a small number of companies - only
nine listed on the local exchange have shareholder funds of more than
SDollars 1bn (USDollars 613m). While most of these companies can be expected
to turn in good results each year, they are seen as steady, if not
spectacular, performers.
But things are changing. After much official foot dragging, Singapore is
about to embark on a privatisation programme which is likely to change
completely the character of the local market over the next two to three
years.
Singapore Telecom (ST), the state-owned telecommunications and postal
service, is first on the seller's block. The ST floatation is being billed
as the largest public listing yet in the south-east Asia region.
When floated, it is estimated that ST will be valued at SDollars 10bn to
SDollars 15bn. 'The Singapore Telecom float will add about 15 per cent to
total market capitalisation overnight,' said one broker. 'It will be the
biggest thing to hit the exchange in a long, long while.
Singapore Airlines, partially privatised by the government in the mid-1980s,
will be the only listed company comparable in size. SIA now has a market
capitalisation of SDollars 12bn.
The government has not set a date for the flotation, but all indications
point to July or August this year. About 25 per cent of ST is likely to be
floated, with about 15 per cent available to foreigners, the rest reserved
for Singapore citizens.
The government proposes selling shares to Singaporeans at a discount, and is
putting SDollars 200m into a compulsory savings fund so as to encourage a
wide uptake of shares.
Dr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, says people will be given
incentives to hold on to shares rather than seek to make a quick profit.
'The discount will be structured to discourage stagging. The last thing we
want to see is what happened in the UK, where people took shares at a
discount and got out. That defeats the whole purpose of the exercise.'
There seems little doubt that the ST issue will be massively oversubscribed.
ST is not a plodding state behemoth that the government is anxious to rid
itself of.
Since it was reorganised a little over 10 years ago, ST has built Singapore
telecommunications into the most modern and efficient in south-east Asia.
The company has invested heavily in modern technologies such as packet
switching, integrated services digital networks (ISDN), fibre optic
distribution, international leased circuits, video-conferencing and
interactive videotext systems.
While maintaining minimal domestic rates, and with some of the lowest
international rates in the world, ST has managed to accumulate considerable
cash reserves. In the year to March 31 1992, ST's operating income was
SDollars 2.48bn, a 12 per cent rise over the previous year. The net pre-tax
surplus before exceptional items rose 18 per cent to SDollars 1.33bn.
To consolidate Singapore's position as a regional telecommunications hub, ST
plans a SDollars 3.7bn five-year investment programme which includes setting
up a third satellite earth station and more worldwide submarine cable links.
Singapore-based analysts see ST's earnings growing by between 12 and 15 per
cent in the medium term. But the company does face some problems. Singapore,
with a population of under 3m, offers little room for expansion. The city
state already has one telephone to every two people.
ST will be up against considerable competition as it seeks to expand its
services overseas. But through Singapore Telecom International (STI), formed
in 1988, ST says it has already entered into 14 ventures in 11 countries,
with total investments of SDollars 250m.
While these projects are on a limited scale, concerned mostly with data
communications and paging services, considerable opportunities are available
in China, Vietnam and Indonesia - markets already well-known to Singapore.
The government is determined that the ST flotation will take place without
any problems. It is being watched as the guide for a spate of further
sell-offs of state enterprises. The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) and
the electricity and gas divisions of the public utilities board are likely
to be partially privatised over the next two years. The Singapore mass
transit system and portions of other, mostly financially successful state
enterprises, will also be listed.
In recent years, Singapore has been overshadowed by the excitement of other
fast-expanding regional markets. Kuala Lumpur in nearby Malaysia, now has a
market capitalisation almost twice that of Singapore. But all that is likely
to now change, giving the Singapore broking community a bout of much delayed
excitement.

NISSHIN Steel, a leading Japanese maker of stainless steel, yesterday said
it would post net losses for the year to the end of March due to the
liquidation of NSK, its financial subsidiary, which has faced mounting
losses on its stock portfolio.
The company forecast net losses of Y18.5bn (Dollars 152.89m) for the year
and a cut in its dividend to Y5 from the previous year's Y7.
Nisshin Steel is one of Japan's many industrial groups which indulged in
zaiteku, or financial engineering, in the boom days of the late 1980s.
It set up NSK in 1987 to invest in the stock market and to extend loans. At
its peak, in 1990, NSK managed Y190bn in tokkin, or trust funds.
However, the fall in Japanese shares hit NSK, and the parent company decided
to dismantle it after attempts at a restructuring last year and cutting
interest on loans failed.
Nisshin will record a special loss of Y28bn on the liquidation.
The decision comes as the company faces a fall in sales and profits due to
depressed demand for its steel products from the motor, electronics and
construction industries.
Pre-tax profits and sales forecasts for the year were unchanged at a 62.4
per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y11bn and a 7.3 per cent decline in
sales to Y400bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE controversial 'demerger' plan at Marriott Corporation, the large US
hotel and management services company, faced a new potential hurdle
yesterday when a group of investors who hold Marriott preferred shares said
that they might take legal action to oppose the scheme.
The investor group made a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the US securities industry watchdog, in which it said that it
held a 6.4 per cent beneficial stake in the company (once its preferred
stock and liquid yield option notes are converted).
The group added that it believed the plan was 'unlawfully coercive of, and
detrimental to, the holders of preferred stock'.
The group comprises a handful of institutional investors, including Harvard
College and UBS Securities, who together speak for about half the 4m
convertible preferred shares in issue.
In the filing, the investors' group said it was seeking a change to the
demerger plan which would improve the treatment of preferred stockholders.
It added that it would seek compensation if the plan went through as
currently proposed.
Marriott said that it had not seen the filing and could not comment on it.
No talks between the company and investor group are believed to have taken
place, although the preferred stockholders said in their filing that they
were willing to negotiate.
Marriott's plan to split itself into two separately-quoted companies - one
containing its financially-healthy hotels business and the other, its
property assets together with most of the group's debt - has already
provoked anger among its bondholders.
One group of bondholders, which includes some of the largest institutional
investors in the US, withdrew its opposition after Marriott revised the
demerger plan earlier this year.
However, talks with a second group of unhappy bondholders, led by PPM
America, part of the UK's Prudential insurance group, are still continuing.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak accuses Sony of
patent infringement

<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak has filed a suit against Sony, one of Japan's leading
electronics manufacturers, in a patent infringement dispute that could have
broad implications throughout the consumer electronics industry.
Kodak alleges that Sony's video cassette recorders, camcorders (video
cameras) and other audio and video recording products infringe upon a patent
that the US company obtained in 1981 covering a new type of recording head
for magnetic recording devices.
Industry analysts say that the same technology is widely used throughout the
consumer electronics industry. Kodak declined to comment on whether it has
granted patent licenses to other manufac-turers.
According to the complaint, which was filed in Texas, Kodak has been
attempting to reach a licensing agreement with Sony since the late 1980s.
Kodak is asking the court to issue an injunction to prevent Sony from
selling products in the US that allegedly infringe its patent.
The US company is also seeking treble damages, although it does not specify
the amount, and has asked for a jury trial. Sony's sales in the US last year
were over Dollars 6bn, of which VCRs and video cameras represented a
significant portion. Sony America declined to comment on the suit.
The damages covered by the Kodak claim could be substantial, said Mr Jack
Kelly of Goldman Sachs. He said the suit against Sony might encourage other
manufacturers of recording equipment to seek licenses from Kodak.
Kodak is awaiting a decision from the Japanese patent office on whether it
will grant a similar patent in Japan. The patent application, which was
filed in 1981, has been opposed by several Japanese companies.

The move follows overwhelming agreement at the bank's annual meeting to

agreed last November to prop up the bank.
Acceptance of the proposal means the bank can receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars

Dollars 45.6m, compared with Dollars 114.2m in the same period of 1991, and
said the bank had agreed to support its business plan, which calls for
substantial new film production, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
MGM had an operating loss for the period of Dollars 8.5m, down from Dollars

218.7m a year earlier.
Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, co-chairmen, said the 'continuing and
now formalised support of Credit Lyonnais is vitally important to our
objective of building this organisation, maintaining its improved
performance and renewing MGM's stature in our industry.'
For the full year, MGM reported a net loss before extraordinary items and
accounting changes of Dollars 236m, down from Dollars 347m, on revenues of
Dollars 936.7m, against Dollars 921.7m.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox improves 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARNAUDMETALBOX, the French packaging company whose 25.3 per cent
shareholder MB-Caradon, the UK building products and security printing
group, is considering selling its stake, increased net profits by 15 per
cent to FFr976m (Dollars 174m) in 1992. That was in spite of tough trading
conditions and the effect of devaluations against the franc.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, president and chief executive officer, said the results
showed that CMB was recession-resistant.
He said that even without any recovery in its markets in 1993, the group
should show further progress. There were gains to come from cutting costs,
saving working capital and using FFr1.5bn of tax losses.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of CGIP, the Frech holding company which
has a 25.3 per cent stake in CMB, said if MB-Caradon sells, CGIP aims to buy
7 per cent and an associate investor would buy a further 6 per cent. The
Paris stock exchange had said this would not necessitate a full bid.
Sales in 1992 fell 3 per cent to FFr 24.8bn, but would have been 2 per cent
ahead on constant exchange rates. Lower resin prices hit prices for plastic
packaging but margins in the division improved pushing the group operating
margin up from 9.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent.
Operating profits rose 2 per cent to FFr 2.5bn. Lower reorganisation costs
of FFr262m compared with FFr389m and a fall in interest charges to FFr 642m
from FFr 672m led to a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to FFr 1.7bn.
Earnings per share were FFr 12.07 up 14 per cent. A dividend of FFr4 is
proposed, an 8 per cent rise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET consolidated profits at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's
second-largest holding company, were dragged down in 1992 by the collapse in
profits at Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, and reduced capital gains on
other shareholdings.
Profits at GBL slipped to BFr6.33bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, from BFr7.02bn.
The contribution from the group's 20.2 per cent stake in Petrofina was
BFr940m lower than in 1991. The company said it proposed holding its net
ordinary dividend at BFr142.5 per share.
However, the company pointed out that its consolidated profit before
exceptional items and capital gains had increased by 7.3 per cent to
BFr4.59bn from BFr4.28bn.
The group said that barring unforeseen circumstances it expected the 1993
profit before capital gains to be roughly the same as last year.
GBL confirmed yesterday it had put an end to various long-running legal
cases in the US which followed the 1990 collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
the securities group in which the Belgian company had a stake. GBL wrote off
BFr3.2bn against the stake in its 1989 accounts. The group said yesterday
that an agreement signed in the US 'wiped out all possible action against
GBL concerning Drexel.'
GBL said other core holdings had performed well in 1992, in spite of the
difficult economic climate. The group picked out Tractebel, the utilities
group, Royale Belge, the insurance company which announces results today,
Parfinance, the French holding company, and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT), the Luxembourg broadcaster.
Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank, improved its contribution
by BFr113m, according to GBL, which is the bank's largest shareholder.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Daimler's arrival marks new
spirit at US securities agency - Accounting requirements have deterred
foreigners from the NYSE. Patrick Harverson argues the SEC may be relaxing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a tradition at the New York Stock Exchange that the arrival of a stock
listing is marked by a ceremony on the trading floor.
When Harley-Davidson was floated a few years ago, one of its famed
motorcycles was driven on to the floor for the opening of trading.
Whether Daimler-Benz, which later this year will become the first German
company to list its shares on the NYSE, will commemorate its debut in a
similar fashion remains to be seen. As Mr William Donaldson, NYSE chairman
joked: 'I don't know whether we can get a Mercedes on to the trading floor,
but I'm certain we'll find a suitable way to celebrate the first trade.'
Mr Donaldson has every reason to be pleased. Although it has always been the
world's largest stock exchange, the NYSE has struggled to attract listings
from foreign companies. It has long argued that the strict domestic
accounting requirements that the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
securities industry watchdog, insists foreign companies meet before selling
their securities to US investors put the NYSE at a disadvantage.
The NYSE's main rival for overseas listings in the increasingly competitive
international capital markets is the London stock exchange. It has been able
to attract more foreign companies because standards of financial disclosure
in the UK are less onerous than in the US.
This allowed London to build a large lead on the NYSE. There are 760 foreign
stocks listed or actively traded on the London SE. Only 121 non-US stocks
are traded on the NYSE, even though it is a bigger, more liquid market than
London's.
To narrow this gap, the NYSE has lobbied hard to get the SEC to relax some
of its rules, but the agency has insisted that US investors should be
allowed access to the same information on foreign companies that is
available on domestic companies.
This insistence has deterred many foreign companies, who view the US
accounting requirements as too costly and burdensome. German companies, with
their more secretive approach to accounting, have stayed away.
This week's agreement between the SEC and Daimler, suggests the SEC may be
adopting a more accommodating stance. There was, said Mr Gerhard Liener,
Daimler's chief financial officer, a new spirit at the agency.
Although the SEC insisted it had not changed its policy on financial
disclosure, it was clear the agency made modest concessions to match
Daimler's - primarily concerning the accounting of the German company's past
earnings and the treatment of goodwill.
The importance of the Daimler listing to the NYSE and other US markets is
that it proves to foreign companies that agreement over the thorny issue of
accounting standards is possible.
The NYSE hopes the Daimler-SEC agreement will open the door to other foreign
companies seeking a foothold in the world's largest capital market. As Mr
Donaldson says: 'It is my hope that (the) announcement is the first step
down the road toward accords that will open US markets to hundreds of
companies in Germany and elsewhere in the world, and do so as soon as
possible.'
Daimler's chief financial officer is inclined to agree with Mr Donaldson. Mr
Liener said it was probable that Deutsche Bank, Daimler's largest
shareholder and Germany's biggest banking group, would seek a listing in New
York. Other big companies from Switzerland and Austria, where accounting
principles are similar to Germany's, may follow the path.
While Daimler is coming to the US markets because it wants access to a large
new pool of capital, it is unlikely that the German company would be
breaking ground were it not for the growing appetite among US investors for
foreign stocks.
US investors have been reluctant to invest overseas, partly because the lack
of information about foreign companies raised the risks of buying non-US
stock, and partly because domestic equities had for so long provided secure,
bountiful returns.
However, much has changed. Mr David Boyle, managing director at Citibank,
which is one of the leading US depositary banks for foreign shares, says:
'Over the last four to five years advances in technology - primarily in data
processing and telecommunications - means that the flow of information
around the world has increased greatly, and this has allayed a lot of
investors' concerns here in the US.'
More importantly, US investors have begun looking overseas for better
returns on their money. As Mr Boyle says: 'US investors are seeking higher
risk-adjusted returns on their portfolios. Price-earnings ratios here have
been high for some time, given there has been quite a run in the market in
recent years.'
Consequently, trading on US markets in foreign shares (primarily in the form
of depositary receipts, which are issued by almost all overseas companies in
the US other than those from Canada) has risen over the past few years.
According to Citibank, Dollars 24.1bn of depositary receipts were traded on
US exchanges in 1985. By last year, that figure had jumped to Dollars
123.2bn.
There is a growing supply of foreign securities to meet that demand.
Securities Data in New York says that 49 foreign companies issued Dollars
5.5bn of common stock in the US last year, up from 1991, when 31 issuers
sold Dollars 4.7bn worth of common stock. Just seven years ago, a meagre
Dollars 636m of stock was issued in the US by foreign companies.
Although Daimler was reluctant to be pinned down on whether, or when, it
might join the list of foreign issuers, it seems likely that the German
company will be selling its securities to US investors over the next 12 to
18 months. In the meantime, Daimler must concentrate on more important
issues - such as finding a suitable way to celebrate the opening of trading
in Daimler stock on the NYSE.

THE Norwegian government has extended its grip on the commercial banks,
raising its stake in Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest, to 70 per cent from
55 per cent.
The move follows overwhelming agreement at the bank's annual meeting to
write down the value of its ordinary share capital to zero as part of a deal
agreed last November to prop up the bank. Acceptance of the proposal means
the bank can receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars 217m) in fresh preference capital.
The Bank Insurance Fund and Bank Investment Fund became owners of
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, respectively Norway's second and
third-biggest banks, in 1991 in similar rescue operations.
DnB said the decision applied to writedowns to zero of NKr1.25bn in
preference capital obtained from the Bank Insurance Fund, and NKr938.8m in
preference capital from the Guarantee Fund of the Commercial Banks.
Following the write-downs, the bank's share capital amounts to NKr2.375bn.

APPLE Macintosh personal computers will find their way into the cockpits of

Honeywell's Commercial Flight Systems Group.
Under the deal, Honeywell will develop an electronic library which will
provide flight crews with multi-media versions of maintenance and operation
manuals that incorporate video, graphics and sound as well as text.
Honeywell will also make a 'ruggedised' version of Apple's
recently-introduced Macintosh Quadra 800 high-performance PC for the cockpit
information system.
This is the first time Apple has licensed its Macintosh computer technology
under such an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement and signals a new
strategy to broaden the markets for its technology.
Honeywell said it planned to provide its airline customers with an
easy-to-use information system.
The Honeywell deal is the first to be reached by New Media/New Markets, a
new group formed at Apple to focus on opportunities created by publishing,
entertainment, telecommunications, computing and consumer electronics.

APPLE Computer, the US company, has overtaken Toshiba as the third-largest
supplier in the Japanese personal computer market, according to Dataquest,
the market research group.
Apple has concluded sales agreements with distributors including Minolta
Camera and Mitsubishi Corp, the trading house. It has worked closely with
third-party software developers to localise software applications.
In 1992, it increased its share of the Japanese market by 2.9 points to 8.3
per cent, against a share of 7.6 per cent for Toshiba, Dataquest stated.
This puts it in third place, after NEC, which took a 53.4 per cent chunk of
the market and Fujitsu with 9.8 per cent.
Apple was significantly ahead of IBM Japan, which has made a big effort to
increase its presence in the Japanese market with the launch of bilingual
software. IBM ranked fifth with 6.1 per cent of the market, according to
Dataquest.
In a separate study, IDC, another high-technology consultancy, ranked Apple
second after NEC.
Apple's stronger showing in the Japanese market comes as the market has
suffered a drop in demand, with PC shipments down by 5.8 per cent in 1992 to
2.23m units. In value terms, this represents a 11.5 per cent fall to Y552bn
(Dollars 4.8bn).
Apple has seen its market share in Japan grow over the past three years and
Dataquest said its success stems from the visually appealing output
available from an Apple machine.
Dataquest said the Japanese PC market would recover in 1993 due to the
growing range of low-cost PCs, new software and replacement demand.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Loss at Von Roll steel group
widens to SFr55m

<TEXT>
VON ROLL, the Swiss steel group, said its loss widened in 1992 to SFr55m
(Dollars 36.7m) from SFr30m in 1991, and forecast a further loss this year.
'In 1993, we will be able to improve the operating result, but the delayed
start-up of our waste incinerator in the US, high restructuring costs at
foreign units of Von Roll Isola, and the unfavourable market for both our
Swiss steelworks, will lead to another negative result,' the directors
forecast.
Von Roll, in which Proventus of Sweden bought a 20 per cent stake in
December 1991, said virtually all of its business activities and important
markets suffered last year.
Turnover was down 8 per cent to SFr2.11bn.
Grands Magasins Jelmoli, the leading Swiss department store group, said
consolidated net profit was flat at SFr11m last year on sales up 2.6 per
cent to SFr1.55bn.
The group, 51 per cent owned by UTC International, said it was offering to
buy out minority shareholders of 60 per cent held Au Grand Passage and 55.3
per cent held Innovation through share exchanges.

MERCEDES-BENZ has pulled out of its planned co-operation ventures with two
leading Czech truck producers, Avia Praha and Liaz, in another sign of the
decelerating German and European new truck markets, AP-DJ reports from
Stuttgart.
The car and truck division of Germany's Daimler-Benz industrial group will
instead build the new six-ton trucks at its existing truck plant in Woerth,
said Mr Helmut Werner, chairman-designate.
The German company has also scheduled a news conference for Monday in
Dearborn, Michigan, when it is expected to announce plans to build a new
factory in North Carolina or South Carolina to produce a new sports-utility
vehicle, Reuter adds from Detroit.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Not-so-big bang in Tokyo - New
broking rules take effect today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pre-publicity in the late 1980s had heralded today as Japan's 'big
bang': the wall between brokers and bankers was to be torn down, and
financial deregulation would bring tough competition and rich opportunities.
Instead, today's 'bang' in the Japanese financial system will be barely
audible - though it is likely eventually to have widespread repercussions. A
Financial System Reform Law, applying from today, will slowly dismantle the
barriers between different types of financial institution, thereby
increasing the pressure on inefficient institutions.
The limited changes that take effect today are partly a product of the
times. Reform was conceived when Tokyo stock prices were surging and there
seemed to be ample profits for all. But legislation has come after three
years of falling prices, leaving most brokers with losses and many banks
with bad loans.
It is also the Japanese way to take change slowly, easing institutions into
new areas and attempting to keep existing players content. The legislation
may be important, but the ministry of finance never allows itself to be
rushed on such matters.
Only long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan, are now
allowed in the securities markets, and even then only to underwrite and deal
in bonds; they still have no right to handle stocks or even deal in
equity-linked bonds. Commercial banks, such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo and
Mitsubishi Bank, must wait another year - perhaps longer - for these limited
privileges, which may be reviewed, the finance ministry says, in 'two to
three years'.
Meanwhile, brokers are now allowed into trust banking. The four leading
houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi
Securities - have plans for new subsidiaries, which are expected gradually
to be given greater freedoms by the ministry.
But there will no quick profits for bankers or brokers, though the ministry
insists that the new subsidiaries should be making a profit after three
years. One banker going through the motions of establishing a new operation
said that, given the choice, the company would like to delay the opening of
its new subsidiary.
'Now is really not the best time for us to be doing this. We are limited in
what we can do, and will not make money, but we can't afford to offend the
ministry. If we had said we had decided to wait a year, they could have made
life difficult for us,' the banker said.
Institutions are expected to make formal applications to the ministry in the
next few weeks, providing details of capital, the identity of executives,
and branch plans. In May, or perhaps June, the ministry will allow the
subsidiaries to open.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Total plunges to FFr2.85bn on
low oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French oil group, yesterday confirmed that it suffered a steep
decline in net income to FFr2.85bn (Dollars 518m) last year from FFr5.81bn
in 1991, due to low oil prices and adverse exchange rates.
The fall in profits comes at a delicate time for Total, which last year
staged a FFr9.5bn share sale in which the then socialist government reduced
its holding from 31.6 per cent to 15 per cent. The group is a candidate for
full privatisation by France's new conservative administration.
Sales fell to FFr136.61bn in 1992 from FFr143.02bn in 1991, while operating
profits slipped to FFr7.32bn from FFr10.33bn over the same period. Earnings
per share fell from FFr27.50 to FFr13.50.
The worst affected area of activity was refining, where operating profits
fell sharply to FFr2.15bn from FFr4.87bn. Total said the impact of the
squeeze on refining margins was mitigated by improvements in marketing.
The group also suffered a steep decline in its trading and Middle Eastern
business, where operating profits almost halved to FFr567m from FFr1.04bn.
However, Total managed to maintain operating profits at FFr2.94bn in
exploration and production. The chemicals division saw profits rise to
FFr1.66bn last year from FFr1.49bn in 1991, mainly as a result of
rationalisation.
The reduction in operating profits contributed to a fall in cashflow to
FFr9.95bn from FFr13.65bn.
Gearing rose to 31 per cent from 25 per cent.
Coface, the French overseas export credit guarantee agency, saw net
consolidated profits rise by 11.2 per cent to FFr157.8m in 1992 from
FFr141.9m in 1991.
The company, which is controlled by the French government, earlier this year
gained a new shareholder in Societe Commerciale de Reassurances, France's
largest reinsurance group, which bought a 20 per cent stake.
Mr Pierre-Yves Cosse, chairman, said that group sales rose by 39 per cent
from FFr1.2bn in 1991 to FFr1.66bn last year, although on a constant
structure the increase would have been significantly lower at 12.5 per cent
to just FFr1.34bn.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Tampella disposal ends link with
forestry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S Tampella group is ending a century-long involvement in forestry
through a FM3.6bn (Dollars 609m) sale of operations to Enso-Gutzeit, one of
the country's leading pulp and paper groups.
The agreement cuts Tampella's debt burden sharply and leaves it free to
concentrate on its international metal engineering business. It also makes
Enso one of Europe's top three newsprint manufacturers and the leading
corrugated board producer in Scandinavia.
Enso is acquiring Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe and lifting its stake in
Sunila, a pulping company, to 47.5 per cent from 20 per cent. It is taking
over FM2.6bn in debt and paying FM1bn, FM800m of which will be funded
through a new share issue.
The deal involves a reshuffle of state-owned assets as the state has a 57.8
per cent stake in Enso and holds more than 90 per cent of Tampella shares.
The Bank of Finland, which holds the Tampella shares through an earlier
rescue of Skopbank, has made it clear that it does not want to be a
long-term industrial owner and the disposal should help it find new owners
for the remaining business.
The operations being sold had combined sales of FM3.35bn in 1992, and though
lossmaking last year, are expected to return to profit in 1993. Tampella
Forest is Europe's leading manufacturer of uncoated wood-containing book
papers and its third-largest producer of special newsprint, with operations
in Finland, Germany and Spain. Tambox Europe specialises in corrugated board
and has eight mills in Finland, Sweden and Italy.
The main effect of the deal will be to give Enso an enhanced position in
newsprint production, as it will have a 1.2m tonne capacity when combined
with a mill being built in Germany. It will also bolster its position within
packaging and saw-milling.
'Advantages will be gained through streamlining and through a more intensive
use of marketing,' said Mr Jukka Harmala, Enso chief executive.

<TEXT>
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, has initiated a
wide-ranging recovery plan after slumping to a FM2.22bn (Dollars 375m) loss
before taxes and reserves in 1992.
The aim is to strengthen the group's balance sheet and return it to profit
in 1994.
The group will sell assets and businesses worth a 'number of billion Finnish
markka' over the next few years, cut investments from FM4bn to FM2bn a year
in 1994 and 1995, reduce staff by 1,300 to save FM300m, and cut other fixed
costs by at least FM300m.
Last year's losses followed a FM478m profit in 1991.
The company struck a trading loss of FM125.7m in 1992, after a FM1.03bn
profit in 1991, which was aggravated by interest expenses and foreign
exchange losses. The latter totalled FM900m, and were mainly due to last
September's decision to float the markka.
Net sales rose to FM57.4bn from FM53.0bn, but the operating margin fell to
FM1.8bn from FM2.6bn. Oil sales rose to FM46.0bn from FM42.7bn, while
chemical sales increased to FM10bn from FM8.9bn.

FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank beats forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GOOD fourth quarter last year helped Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest
bank, improve its total operating profits for 1992 by 7 per cent to DM6.39bn
(Dollars 3.94bn).
The rate of increase in total operating profits - which include the profits
made from own-account securities trading - was lower than at other German
banks which have reported in the past two weeks, but better than analysts'
expectations.
Analysts had expected that profits would be flat or worse following a 5 per
cent drop at the 10-month stage, revealed in December last year. But Mr
Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chief executive, said Deutsche had enjoyed a
better fourth quarter following difficult conditions in the previous six
months.
He said that conditions continued to be good in the early part of 1993 and
the parent company bank had experienced 'double-digit' growth in profits in
the first two months of the current year.
Although Deutsche said it increased its bad debt provisions by a
significant, but undisclosed, amount last year, the figures show the German
banking sector's continuing immunity to the increasingly severe economic
downturn in Germany.
Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest bank, increased operating profits by 20
per cent last year, and Dresdner Bank, the second-biggest bank which reports
today, increased operating profits by 17 per cent in the first 10 months of
last year.
Shares in both these banks have outperformed both the German stock market
and those of Deutsche since the beginning of the year.
Deutsche's growth in net income was 29.7 per cent to DM1.83bn reflecting
special factors such as the the release of provisions on sovereign debt
affecting eight countries.
The operating results reflected strong securities business - profits in this
area were DM1.12bn, broadly the same as in 1991 - as well as lending and fee
income. Total assets increased by 10.6 per cent to DM496.6bn while net
interest income rose 5.1 per cent to DM11.16bn and net commission income
increased by 11.2 per cent to DM4.2bn.
Total operating expenses rose by 7.7 per cent to DM10.41bn, half the rate of
increase in 1991. The net interest margin fell 11 basis points to 2.3 per
cent.
Mr Kopper said Deutsche was, in principle, keen to seek a listing for its
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, following Daimler-Benz's agreement
with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission earlier this week which will lead
to a listing later this year.
Mr Kopper said the bank would study the details of the agreement between the
SEC and Daimler, Germany's largest industrial company in which Deutsche has
a 28 per cent stake.
One possible objection to a listing would be a requirement to consolidate
this stake, he said.
The 1992 dividend is to be DM15 a share, the same as for 1991.

<TEXT>
PINAULT-Printemps, the heavily-indebted French retail group, lifted net
profits 16.5 per cent to FFr586m (Dollars 106m) in 1992 from FFr503m in
1991, the year that it took over Au Printemps department stores,
Mr Francois Pinault, chairman, stressed that the results were not
comparable, as the 1991 figures included only a one-month contribution from
Au Printemps and six months from the Conforama furniture chain.
Pinault's sales almost doubled to FFr70.23bn last year from FFr36.3bn,
reflecting the impact of the Au Printemps deal. But operating profits only
rose by 20 per cent to FFr2.79bn from FFr2.32bn.
The company said it had suffered from 'stagnation of demand' in some
sectors. French retailing has been affected by the economic slowdown, due to
the combination of static consumer demand and the instability caused by a
number of large corporate transactions, notably Pinault's purchase of Au
Printemps.

<TEXT>
NORSK DATA, the troubled Norwegian computer service group, is to be acquired
by Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, the group's two biggest financial
creditors, under a compromise proposal to rescue the group from bankruptcy.
Unsecured creditors have been offered a cash dividend payment of 25 per cent
of what they are owed.
Norsk Data reported a fall in 1992 pre-tax losses to NKr382.4m (Dollars
55.5m) from NKr849m in 1991 and charged 1992 accounts with extraordinary
expenses of NKr287.3m against a restructuring charge of NKr655m in 1991.
The group said DnB and Fokus, two of Norway's top three banks, had agreed to
refinance outstanding debt, estimated at NKr600m. They have demanded that
Norsk Data's share capital be written down to zero, and that a share issue
be undertaken by partly converting the banks' debt to equity. DnB holds
about two-thirds of the group's debt.
Norsk Data's directors back the proposal, providing it does not entail
differentiation of treatment of existing shareholders, and will formally
recommend acceptance at the annual general meeting, probably in May or June.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Senior suffers 65% downturn to Pounds 6.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ENGINEERING, the tubing, ductwork and thermal engineering group,
yesterday reported a 65 per cent fall in 1992 pre-tax profits, illustrating
how the new Financial Reporting Standard 3 can transform the presentation of
results.
At the pre-tax level profits fell from Pounds 18.3m in 1991 to Pounds 6.3m,
due to the accounting implications of the withdrawal from the mining
equipment industry, and closure of the large power project contracting side.
Losses of Pounds 6.6m on these decisions - completed last week with the
disposal of the Senior Conflow water control equipment businesses - have
been charged against 1992 profits as planned. But, because of FRS 3, Senior
has also had to charge the Pounds 5.6m of goodwill incurred when the
businesses were originally bought.
The effect leaves net income down sharply at Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 12.4m).
Earnings per share dropped from a restated 6.3p to 0.98p.
However, executives stressed yesterday that these figures did not reflect
the underlying performance. 'We're now in better shape than we've ever
been,' said Mr John Bell, chief executive.
Operating profits from continuing businesses edged up 1.8 per cent to Pounds
17.2m.
The Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) acquisition of Flexonics in the US last
February, along with several smaller acquisitions, had added a further
Pounds 3.9m of operating profit, more than was expected.
Overall, operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 16.9m
to Pounds 21.1m - a figure which Mr Bell views as the yardstick for 1993.
'Underlying' earnings per share rose from a restated 5.68p to 6.26p.
The latest results cap a year of considerable activity for Senior.
Mr Bell's relief at being out of the mining equipment business is more than
matched by his delight with Flexonics, which makes flexible hose and
expansion joints.
Senior is looking for another similar acquisition, especially in the US.
Flexonics, which was virtually unknown outside the US when it was purchased,
offered considerable potential for growth, said Mr Bell.
The purchase had also helped lift operating margin in the engineered product
business from 3.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent and lift operating profits from
Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 6.9m.
Profits also rose from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 8.4m in thermal engineering,
but construction services profits dipped from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 5.8m.
On the outlook, Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said the increased confidence
being generally expressed in the UK economy was not being reflected in the
group's businesses except in isolated cases. However, there were increasing
signs of improvement in the US.
A recommended final dividend of 1.95p maintains the total for the year at
3.15p.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: IDV takes stake in Hungarian distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the Grand Metropolitan drinks company,
is buying a 25 per cent stake in Zwack Unicum, Hungary's leading spirits
producer and distributor.
The acquisition price was not disclosed but the Hungarian group plans to
raise between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m from a public offer of a further 25
per cent shareholding.
Mr Colin Gordon, president of IDV Europe, said yesterday that the deal was
'an important step in IDV's strategy for expansion in eastern Europe. It
strengthens our distribution base in Hungary . . . a market with great
potential for IDV's portfolio of international brands.'
IDV established a local organisation in Hungary two years ago to manage the
distribution of its brands, including Smirnoff vodka and J&amp;B whisky,
Zwack Unicum, which is owned by Mr Peter Zwack and Mr Emil Underberg, has
annual turnover of Pounds 75m and accounts for nearly half the Hungarian
spirits market.
Mr Zwack was one of the first Hungarian businessmen to return home as the
communist regime collapsed in 1989. He fled the country in 1948 when the
family drinks business was seized by the state, taking with him the secret
recipe for Unicum, a distillation of herbs and spices which his family had
introduced in 1790 and developed into the country's most popular drink.
Production of the brand was resumed in 1990. It has sales of half a million
cases a year and is exported to Japan and several European markets

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Adwest ahead 60% to Pounds 3.2m - Benefits
from two-year restructuring programme come through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADWEST GROUP yesterday announced a 60 per cent jump in first-half profits,
helped by a two-year restructuring programme which reduced the workforce at
the automotive components, defence and property company by some 1,100.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2m to Pounds 3.2m on sales ahead by just 4
per cent to Pounds 63m for the six months to December 31.
The sharp difference in sales against profits was the result of 'all the
work we have put into streamlining our businesses', according to Mr Fred
Grant, chairman.
As part of the restructuring programme, the workforce has fallen from 3,350
in 1991 to 2,250.
The group did not expect such a strong advance for the full year, however,
and forecast a maintained total dividend of 7p. The interim was increased by
60 per cent to 2p, solely to balance out the interim and final dividends.
Earnings per share rose by 1.4p to 3.7p.
Mr Grant said momentum had begun to slacken toward the end of the first
half, especially in France and Germany where recession was beginning to
bite.
Adwest was also unlikely to benefit significantly from the recent upturn in
the US, where its defence businesses are based. 'Defence is not flavour of
the month, and is not likely to be,' said Mr Graham Menzies, managing
director.
Taken together, these three countries accounted for some 35 per cent of
sales. 'But that doesn't mean we still won't have a pretty satisfactory year
at the end of the piece,' Mr Grant said. Analysts are forecasting a range of
Pounds 8m to Pounds 9.5m, against last year's Pounds 7.5m.
During the first half, the automotive division had shown increases in both
sales - from Pounds 34m to Pounds 38.6m - and in profits. Mr Menzies said
new Japanese business was expected partially to offset the softening of
demand in France and Germany.
The situation at at Leyland Daf, an Adwest customer, was not expected to
have a material effect on this division's second half performance, Mr
Menzies said.
The power systems division - which includes Adwest's defence operation -
increased both profits and margins, although sales were slightly down at
Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 23m).
Defence had proved to be a good cash generator, although it remained a
difficult environment.
Property suffered a decline in margins on the housebuilding side while the
rent roll from commercial development was steady at about Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Menzies said the group now intended to pursue bolt-on acquisitions, which
would be funded through internally generated cash.
Gearing for the full year was expected to be close to last years 29 per
cent.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson AGB benefits from merger with
Pounds 3.12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR NELSON AGB yes-terday issued its first full year results since
becoming the largest market research group in the UK following the merger of
Taylor Nelson and AGB Research.
The expanded group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.12m last year
against Pounds 486,000 in 1991, with higher net in-terest income of Pounds
479,000 (Pounds 122,000) more than off-setting the group's share of losses
from associates, which increased to Pounds 294,000 (Pounds 30,000).
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 18.1m) reflec-ting the
acquisition of AGB, part of the collap-sed Maxwell private empire, in March
last year and organic growth in the Taylor Nelson businesses which boosted
their turnover to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 17.9m).
However, some businesses sold by the group in earlier years ran into
financial difficulties and the group, because of its responsibilities as
original tenant, incurred Pounds 1.3m of unexpected rent charges last year.
This cost, which is included in a Pounds 1.62m extraordinary charge, also
includes a provision for future rental payments.
Despite the extraordinary charge, earnings per share more than doubled to
1.28p (0.62p), and the group is paying a final dividend of 0.2p, making 0.3p
for the year, up from 0.15p a share in 1991.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said: 'the merger of the existing Taylor
Nelson businesses, with the acquired AGB, RSGB and related businesses, has
proved to be profitable for the group and for shareholders, and has
generated considerable opportunities for development and expansion'.
He said that against a 'difficult and highly competitive market background'
the group achieved its profit margin target, recording a return on sales of
6.6 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent in the second half of 1991.
The group's strong performance and the successful and speedy integration of
the AGB businesses, resulted in very strong cash genera-tion over the year
and the group ended the year to end-December with Pounds 6.7m of net cash.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Country Casuals launches agreed offer for
Lerose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRY CASUALS, the women's wear group, yesterday announced an agreed
Pounds 10.8m offer for House of Lerose, one of its suppliers.
The offer - 9 shares and Pounds 32.50 cash for every 25 Lerose shares -
values the latter at about 190p per share, a premium of some 30 per cent
over Tuesday's close of 146p. Country Casuals' shares fell 2p to 167p.
Accepting Lerose shareholders may elect to receive a greater proportion of
their consideration in either new shares or cash.
Country Casuals, floated in June 1992, increased pre-tax profits 28 per cent
to Pounds 2.58m for the year to January 23 by focusing on undiscounted
sales. This policy resulted in turnover slightly down to Pounds 34.8m
(Pounds 36m) together with 'a significant increase in margins'.
Earnings per share increased 10 per cent to 10.64p.
House of Lerose designs and wholesales women's wear brands, with a
manufacturing side including fabric printing and garments. It reported a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 3.63m) on sales of Pounds
12.1m(Pounds 13.3m), after exceptional credits of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds
2.96m).
'Lerose has substantial assets, a Pounds 9.3m cash flow, and complementary
brands with considerable potential' said Mr John Shannon, executive chairman
of Country Casuals.
Following completion, manufacturing will represent approximately 10 per cent
of the enlarged group's turnover.
Country Casuals announced a maiden final dividend of 2.7p. Lerose is paying
a second interim of 7.3p, in lieu of a final, making a maintained total of
10.3p.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Johnston Group loss deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES AT Johnston Group, the contractor, engineer and property developer,
increased from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 4.68m pre-tax for 1992.
The final dividend is cut to 1p (4.5p) making a 3.25p (9p) total. Losses per
share emerged at 35.65p (14.18p). The shares slipped 5p to 106p.
Directors blamed the downturn on continuing losses from the hydraulics
business, the high costs of absorbing the newly expanded US sweeper
operations and overseas construction.
Exceptional provisions were cut to Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 4.34m). Interest
costs rose to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.46m).
Turnover declined from Pounds 120m to Pounds 117.4m with contracting and
construction down at Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 47.5m) and engineering ahead at
Pounds 57.5m (Pounds 47.2m). Construction materials contributed Pounds 22.4m
(Pounds 25.3m).
The directors said they were continuing to seek greater efficiencies and
effective cost reduction measures. Pay reviews have been deferred throughout
the group.

<TEXT>
from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 13.4m - at Hogg, the broking group, thanks to
problems in the UK credit and political risk insurance markets, and the
depressed US insurance market.
However, turnover grew by 4 per cent - from Pounds 113m to Pounds 117m -
with UK retail business up 9.9 per cent, and UK wholesale business improving
by 15.7 per cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 11.32p (15p), and the final dividend is
maintained at 5p, for an unchanged total of 8.15p.
The market reacted neutrally, with the shares rising 1p to 186p.
Mr James Vaughn, chairman, said that the group's American workforce had been
reduced by 10 per cent during the year, and that the group had taken the
redundancy costs last year, allowing for growth this year.
Underlying broking expenses outstripped revenue growth, increasing by 4 per
cent compared to 3.5 per cent.
Turbulent foreign exchange markets and falling interest rates on both sides
of the Atlantic were blamed for a 3 per cent fall in investment income.
The company's divested Lloyd's managing agencies made Pounds 1.62m (Pounds
2.27m), accounting for 12 per cent of group profits. This is the last year
they will make a contribution to profits.
Its members' agency fell from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 60,000.

<TEXT>
LONDON Securities, the property and investment company which has undergone a
financial restructuring, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 37.6m for the
18 months to end-September.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 37.9m for the preceding 12 months.
Losses per share came out at 57.7p (58.9p).
The voluntary arrangement approved in October limited the rights of recourse
of creditors as at October 16 to the company's assets at that time.
The company now had a working capital facility to cover the current year's
overheads, cash deposits of some Pounds 200,000, no borrowings or creditors,
low overheads and substantial tax losses, Mr David Pearl, chairman, said.
Nu-Swift had taken up its full entitlement on new shares and now holds a
29.2 per cent interest.

<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Ash and Lacy, the West Midlands-based galvanising and metal
products group, fell 22 per cent to Pounds 3.73m pre-tax for the year to
January 1.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 53.9m (Pounds 54.5m). Earnings per
share fell to 9.76p (13.12p). A second interim dividend of 3.9p, payable in
lieu of a final, is declared, making an unchanged 6.4p total.
The directors said galvanising continued to reflect poor market conditions.
Volumes were maintained in the UK but fell in France, with overall
divisional profits down on last year. Profits were broadly unchanged in the
non-ferrous distribution side, and fell in the manufacturing activities.
Group properties were revalued, resulting in a Pounds 3.4m write-down.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield up 19% - Doubled
profits from plantations help set recovery in train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOUBLING of profits from plantations and the first contribution from an
animal feed acquisition started a recovery last year at Harrisons &amp;
Crosfield, the conglomerate.
Pre-tax profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 85m (Pounds 71.2m) on sales of
Pounds 1.93bn (Pounds 1.82bn). But earnings per share of 7.6p, after an
increased tax rate, again failed to cover the maintained dividend of 9p,
including a 5.4p final.
The food and agriculture division increased operating profit by nearly
Pounds 10m to Pounds 38.6m, making it the biggest component in group
operating profit of Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 92.4m). The BOCM-Silcock animal
feed business, acquired from Unilever for Pounds 67m in June, contributed
Pounds 7.4m.
Mr George Paul, chief executive, said the cost of inte-grating it with the
existing Pauls business, including the closure of 10 mills, had been covered
by balance sheet provisions.
Plantations nearly doubled profit to Pounds 20.1m as palm oil prices rose
and yields were improved by new planting.
The chemical and industrial division was hit by reorganisation costs of
Pounds 3.5m, reducing profit to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 29.5m). In the US, six
sites producing iron oxide had been reduced to two.
Timber and building materials, including the Harcros chain, fell further to
Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 22.8m). Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said the
builders' merchant market had declined by 30 per cent since late 1989.
Net debt rose to Pounds 260m (Pounds 185m), gearing of 51 per cent (38 per
cent), pushed up by the acquisition.
Profits were helped by a Pounds 3.3m gain (Pounds 1.4m loss) on property and
business disposals after deduc-ting a Pounds 6.4m write-off in the value of
the head office, which is due to be sold.
COMMENT
The success of the BOCM acquisition and recovery potential in chemicals and
at Harcros give some grounds for optimism after a fall in pre-tax profit
from Pounds 131m to Pounds 71m between 1989 and 1991. Although gearing looks
a bit high, disposals should bring in the best part of Pounds 30m this year
to provide working capital when demand picks up. But signs of life have been
slow to emerge, other than in chrome chemicals in the US. In the UK, it is
too early to identify a sustained improvement in building materials - a
greater flow of house moves is needed. A note of caution was also sounded
about continental Europe, although less than 20 per cent of group sales go
there. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m this year would give a prospective p/e
of 19 times on yesterday's close of 167p, up 5p. This fully reflects
recovery hopes. Dogged holding of the dividend for three years running -
with the same again predicted - provides 6.7 per cent yield support. But
when will it grow? Profits need to more than double to cover the payment
twice.

Bridport-Gundry, a manufacturer of netting and twisted woven products, swung
from profits of Pounds 172,000 to losses of Pounds 439,000 pre-tax for the
half year to January 31.
Directors said the results were in line with forecast and were affected by
the restructuring of netting and the growing seasonality of the business.
Turnover was static at Pounds 12.9m. However, exports increased by some 50
per cent and now account for 73 per cent (46 per cent) of sales.
Losses per share emerged at 4.63p (earnings 1.66p). The interim dividend is
held at 1.5p.

SHARES IN Norman Hay, the engineering group, fell 8p to 33p after increased
pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.05m were announced for the year to December 31.
In 1991 losses amounted to Pounds 2.16m.
The result was after an exceptional restructuring charge of Pounds 1.47m
(Pounds 2.17m). Directors said the losses were greater than anticipated
because moving the business had coincided with and been compounded by
recession, the company had been obliged to meet new environmental
regulations, and, partly because of those requirements, the project had
overrun by about six months.
Turnover fell to Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 10.7m).
Losses per share deepened from 11.34p to 19.75p and there is no dividend
(1.14p).

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tilbury to shut down property division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Tilbury Douglas jumped 20p to 505p as the UK construction firm
unveiled steady pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m for 1992 and announced that it
intended to close down its loss-making property div- ision.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said Tilbury Douglas, formed after
Tilbury's Pounds 85m takeover of Midlands-based Robert M Douglas in 1991,
would be out of the depressed English property market in five years.
The properties were valued at Pounds 50m, he said, and about Pounds
30m-Pounds 35m was expected to be raised by about 1995.
Tilbury Douglas intended to retain its small but profitable Scottish
housebuilding operation.
There was an Pounds 11.3m extra-ordinary charge to cover the costs of the
withdrawal.
During the year, the company increased sales by 59 per cent to Pounds
381.6m. This was largely due to the full year inclusion of the Douglas
businesses, Mr Bottjer said.
Construction was the strongest performer, with record profits on the back of
strong orders from the water, transport and petrochemical industries.
Profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 13.5m, on sales 68 per cent up at Pounds
321.5m.
Mr Bottjer said the group intended to focus on niche construction businesses
such as heavy electrical contracting.
Net margins for the group as a whole were down from 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per
cent, because of pressures in the construction sector and property losses.
The property division had incurred a Pounds 333,000 deficit against a profit
of Pounds 3m last time.
Mr Bottjer defended the group's decision to pay an uncovered dividend of
33p, including a proposed final of 22.5p, the same as last year, as a sign
of the group's strength in a generally depressed sector.
He said that the group had strong net cash balance of Pounds 6.9m, down from
Pounds 19m after dividend and tax payments, and cash generative businesses.
Earnings per share, depressed by the enlarged share capital after the
Douglas takeover, fell from 46.9p to 31.1p.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: William Baird shares dip as earnings fall
to 14p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY restructuring costs at textiles and engineering group William Baird
pushed earnings per share for 1992 down to 14.1p from 16.5p.
The shares fell 22p to 266p. The company has not yet implemented the FRS3
accounting standard so restructuring costs did not reduce the pre-tax profit
figure of Pounds 23.4m, compared with Pounds 25.1m. Turnover was slightly
higher at Pounds 439.8m (Pounds 419.8m).
There is a second interim dividend in lieu of a final of 5.35p, making an
unchanged total of 8.9p. The early payment is to allow low non-taxpaying
shareholders, such as pension funds, to benefit from current rules on
advance corporation tax.
Profits at the company's textiles operations rose slightly to Pounds 23.7m
from Pounds 23.2m. The outlook for the current year was promising given two
acquisitions last year of Berkertex and Van Gils, said Mr Donald Parr,
chairman.
However, he said that the fall in the value of sterling against the dollar,
which has been widely welcomed by textiles companies, would not be felt
until the second half of 1993 when existing currency hedging arrangements
expired.
Profits at Darchem, the engineering division fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds
5.2m as disposals and closures continued to shrink the business.
The reorganisation of Darchem had been completed at a cost shown as an
extraordinary item, of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 3.9m).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI said yesterday that it was trying to clarify the legal situation
surrounding the status of shares issued as a result of its planned demerger
and the creation of Zeneca, a new publicly listed company.
Trustees with ICI shares may find that the Zeneca shares are regarded as
income of a trust rather than as capital, which will cause problems for
trustees having to balance the distribution of income for the life tenant
against the need to preserve the capital for those entitled to it after the
life tenant's death.
A test case, assisted by ICI and brought by solicitors Berwin Leighton, is
expected to be heard later this month with a judgment expected in early May.

133m
</HEADLINE>

   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home group, has priced its new issue at
260p a share, valuing the group at Pounds 132.6m.
The issue will raise Pounds 63m for the company, cutting its debt to Pounds
15m, or 20 per cent of shareholders' funds.
The float involves the sale of 25.6m shares, 51 per cent of the total. All
have been placed with institutions, but 25 per cent, 6.4m shares, are
available through a public offer which closes on April 7.
Applications from employees will have priority for up to 10 per cent of the
public offer. Dealings are due to start on April 15.
None of the existing shareholders are selling in the issue. National Medical
Enterprises, the US healthcare group which currently holds 90 per cent of
the shares will be diluted to 42 per cent.
At the issue price the shares are on a prospective p/e of 16.7 on forecast
pro forma earnings per share of 15.6p, based on the company's estimate of
pro forma pre-tax profits for the year to end May of Pounds 9.3m.
A notional net dividend of 3.75p for 1992-93 gives a gross yield of 1.8 per
cent.
By Tuesday evening the group had received over 17,000 requests for copies of
the mini-prospectus.
The issue has been underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the brokers
are de Zoete &amp; Bevan.
COMMENT
As one of the leading operators in a fast-growing industry there are few
clouds on WHC's horizon. One might be today's switch to the new state
funding system. Although this should be beneficial on balance, there could
be some dislocation short term. Another is the matter of financing the rapid
growth, which will cost Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m a year. The new money will
fund the next two or three years growth, but after that WHC may be back for
more. However, if growth continues at recent rates, shareholders should be
happy to put more money in. Compared with Takare, the market leader, WHC is
more conservative on capitalising interest and has a higher tax charge. It
also accepts a marginally lower occupancy rate - 94 instead of 98 per cent
in established homes - in order to achieve what it regards as a better mix
of residents, with more private payers. The issue has been priced at a
discount to Takare, and given an improving climate for flotations, should go
well.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Calor ahead of forecasts at Pounds 33.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALOR GROUP, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, yesterday reported
better than expected results for the year to end-December 1992, bolstered by
a stronger performance in the second half.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.6m from Pounds 45m in 1991 after
exceptional charges of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 7.2m) to cover redundancies and
the write down of stock as part of the group's substantial two-year
restructuring programme.
The exceptional charges last year were as reported at the interim stage and
comprised Pounds 11.4m to pay for gas busi-ness redundancies and other
reorganisation costs, and Pounds 3.4m related to a write-down of Air
Separation stock.
An unchanged final dividend of 6p is proposed, maintaining the total for the
year at 12p. The dividend is just covered by earnings per share of 12p
(18.1p).
However, Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said the directors made their
recommendation in the light of buoyant earnings in the core gas business,
the strength of the group's balance sheet, and the fact that the main
restructuring of the group was complete.
Turnover for the year fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 311m (Pounds 362.2m) due
partly to a reduction in the tonnage of gas sold, but mainly to lower
selling prices.
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 54.8m).
Finance costs were again reduced, with net interest charges falling to
Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.6m). This reflected lower interest rates coupled with
a substantial reduction in capital expenditure and tight controls over
working capital.
Year end net borrowing was reduced by Pounds 10m despite further investment
in the Air Separation business and the Pam Gas Central European partnership
with Calor's main shareholder, SHV, the Dutch investment company which owns
46.2 per cent of the stock, and Primagaz, the French LPG distributor.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is being sued in US federal courts over stock
dealings on behalf of Phar-Mor, a drugstore chain which went into Chapter 11
bankruptcy in August, it was disclosed in the bank's annual report.
It is being sued for allegedly placing Dollars 112m (Pounds 79m) of common
stock on behalf of Phar-Mor which should have been registered. NatWest is
also said to have made misrepresentations in connection with the sale of
Dollars 24m of stock.
The bank said it was contesting the allegations and did not believe they
would have a material effect on net assets. It also disclosed that it had
received claims in connection with the collapse of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
The highest paid UK director was Mr Richard Goeltz, the chief financial
officer, who received a total of Pounds 383,900, including Pounds 99,074 of
expenses incurred by the bank in his move from New York to London.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Moorgate Smaller plans to raise Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOORGATE Smaller Companies Investment Trust is raising a maximum of Pounds
30m through a placing of 30m offer units at 100p apiece.
The units will be exchanged for shares at the trust's undiluted net asset
value at the close of business on April 22.
The trust said that 25m units have been conditionally placed, of which 10m
are available to existing shareholders.
A further 5m units will be made available only if there is substantial
demand from the general public.
They would be used to cover applications up to Pounds 6,000 per person where
these had not been satisfied out of the 10m units.
Sir Michael Richardson, chairman, said he expected UK smaller companies to
be early beneficiaries of an upturn in the economy.
Moorgate Smaller Companies was launched in May 1991, with shares priced at
100p. The shares closed yesterday at 126p.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper gains from reduced
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED INTEREST charges helped Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands-based
metal finishing, architectural hardware and electrical products group, start
its move out of recession with a 7.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
before exceptional items, its first increase for three years.
After interest of Pounds 380,000 (Pounds 647,000) pre-tax profits for the
six months to January 31 were Pounds 1.77m.
Last time's Pounds 1.95m was inflated by a pension fund contribution of
Pounds 400,000. The figures were prepared under the FRS 3 accounting
standard.
Turnover was slightly down at Pounds 40.1m, from Pounds 41.4m, but Mr Eddie
Kirk, chairman, noted that the break-even point in all parts of the business
had been lowered as costs had been reduced.
Firmer control of working capital and a reduction in stocks helped cut
borrowings from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 4.2m, giving gearing of 21.9 per cent
at the period end, compared with 31.2 per cent last July and 41.9 per cent
in January 1992.
Signs have emerged of an increase in orders. Mr Kirk said that the group had
just had its best quarter for over two years.
Fully diluted earnings were 2.5p (2.8p) after exceptional items or 2.4p
before them. The interim dividend is lower at 0.7p, against 1.5p, as the
group reverted to its normal policy of paying one third of the likely total
at the halfway stage.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ocean profits plunge Pounds 35m - Losses on
disposals and heavy restructuring costs hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services company,
yesterday reported a fall in profits due to recession and restructuring
costs.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 51m to Pounds 16m in the year to December
31. The profits shortfall included a Pounds 16m loss on a disposal and
Pounds 8.4m of restructuring costs. At the interim stage Ocean reported a 10
per cent fall in profits to Pounds 20.8m.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the company remained cautious
about the outlook for its markets.
Turnover increased 6.2 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn. But higher costs, and the
restructuring charge saw operating profits fall 30 per cent to Pounds 38.1m.
The loss on disposal referred to the sale of Ocean's non-UK bulk liquid
storage business.
Freight and distribution services, which includes MSAS and McGregor Cory,
reported a slight fall in operating profits from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 16m,
mainly because of depreciation and other costs associated with MSAS's new
computer systems.
Operating profits from marine services fell more than Pounds 6m to Pounds
24.1m amid falling demand for offshore oil services. Mr Barber said a
downturn in the North Sea prompted the company to shift its exploration
vessels, mainly to the Far East.
Environmental services announced a 21 per cent increase in profits to Pounds
4m.
Earnings on a FRS 3 basis were 2p (24.6p). Ignoring the losses on disposals
and restructuring costs, earnings were 17.5p. The company is proposing a
maintained final dividend of 9.62p to make an unchanged total of 14.33p.
The shares closed up 2p at 283p.
COMMENT
These results were well flagged so the frightening profits fall - in
headline terms - caused few ripples in the City. Analysts were slightly
disappointed the company was less upbeat about freight forwarding, where
computing costs are likely to continue to drag. However, after a gloomy
picture at the interim stage, oil services performed creditably thanks to
the timely move east. This year a number of factors will work in Ocean's
favour, even if the company's caution about its markets proves correct. The
company should recoup most of last year's restructuring costs through
greater efficiencies while, if the dollar remains stable against sterling,
there should be a currency benefit of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Forecast profits
of Pounds 44m put the shares on just under 14 times. Until there are more
signs of life from its markets, that rating looks about right.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin warns of setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Macdonald Martin Distilleries, producer of Glenmorangie malt
whisky, fell 53p to 390p yesterday after the company warned of a sharp
decline in full year profits.
Pre-tax profits for the year which ended yesterday are expected to be about
Pounds 4m compared with Pounds 8.6m for 1991-92.
The company said it intended to maintain an unchanged final dividend of 6.6p
for A shares and 3.3p for B shares. The price of the B shares fell 50p to
600p
Trading in the second half had continued to be affected by the price
discounting and lack of consumer confidence that had cut interim pre-tax
profits by 42 per cent, said Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director. 'Sales of
proprietary whiskies have not reached expectations and the anticipated
renewal of industry supply contracts has not materialised as a result of
declining trading conditions.'
Bulk blend sales, particularly to Australia and the US, had suffered volume
and margin pressures, though losses had now been stabilised. Bottled blend
volumes were ahead but there had been a substantial reduction in
profitability.
Glenmorangie volumes had fallen 12 per cent in UK duty free. Sales in other
markets were stable, with encouraging performances in Japan, Germany, Spain
and the Netherlands, but increased marketing expenditure had reduced
profits.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wace incurs losses of Pounds 24m after
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL property write-downs and restructuring provisions caused Wace,
the UK-based pre-press and specialist printing group, to report a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 28.4m for the 1992 year and pass its final dividend.
However, Wace surprised the market by deciding to retain its US subsidiary,
after stating last December that it would be offered for sale at about
Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m). The group also decided against writing down the
value of its industrial properties, reducing the Pounds 37m provision it
identified in December by Pounds 12m.
The results were presented by Mr Trevor Grice, who took over as chief
executive in November - nine months after the sudden departure of his
predecessor, Mr John Clegg.
The DTI has still not published its investigation into share dealings
conducted in the name of some of Mr Clegg's relatives, but Wace again
emphasised that the inquiry had no connection with the group.
Mr Grice said that when he arrived, it was planned that Wace should sell
both its US operation - which accounted for nearly half the group's
operating profit last year - and the UK labels business to reduce the
group's gearing level, which currently stands at nearly 200 per cent.
The new chief executive quickly decided not to sell the labels business and
also won the agreement of the group's lenders not to sell the US business,
both of which disposals would have diluted earnings. He said: 'The US
operation is a very good business - it would have broken my heart to sell
it.'
Mr Grice said that the Pounds 37m property write-down flagged in December
was a 'worst-case' position, following a revaluation of the group's
properties in November.
The group had proceeded with the write-down of its investment property from
Pounds 28m to Pounds 8.7m, and made Pounds 5m provision to cover the
disposal of vacant leaseholds.
However, after discussing the issue with his property advisers and auditors,
Mr Grice said the group had decided not to write down the value of the
property owned and occupied by the group by Pounds 11.3m, as it considered
no permanent diminution in value had occurred.
Sales grew from Pounds 308.6m to Pounds 321m in the year to December 31, and
the pre-tax loss of Pounds 28.4m compared with profits of Pounds 9.8m. The
group also made a provision of Pounds 4.1m to cover redundancy and
reorganisation costs.
A total of 211 jobs have been shed since November, reducing the workforce to
4,840. Losses per share of 44p compared with earnings of 1.4p.
Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said it would be imprudent to forecast increased
activity in the group's main markets, but added: 'We are cautiously
optimistic that we will record a marked improvement in our trading
performance in 1993.'
COMMENT
Reversing the decision to sell the group's US subsidiary was unexpected, but
looks positive. Wace insists it could have achieved its target price of
Dollars 100m, but was able to persuade the group's lenders that it makes
more sense to keep a profits earner which should benefit quickly from
recovery. Analysts forecast full-year profits of Pounds 15m, which puts the
shares, down 2p to 90p yesterday, on a very modest prospective multiple of
about 10. The new chief executive has cut costs and insists the underlying
business is sound. Assuming no more nasty surprises lie in store, the shares
could bounce back rapidly as advertising markets recover.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sir Alastair plays the final hand in a
giant game of poker - Andrew Taylor and Robert Peston examine who should pay
for the soaring cost of a railway system linking England and France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE final hand in what Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel,
likes to describe as a giant game of poker is being played.
At stake is who should pay for the soaring cost of installing a railway
system into the already completed tunnels which link terminals at Folkestone
in Kent and Sangatte in northern France.
The protagonists in this unfortunate game are Eurotunnel, led by the
combative Sir Alastair, and Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British
and five French construction companies contracted to design and build the
project.
Transmanche, which has already been paid extra for building the tunnels and
terminals, is seeking to increase the price it is paid for installing the
fixed equipment.
The work, priced originally at Pounds 620m at 1985 prices under a lump sum
contract, was subsequently increased to Pounds 720m following variations to
the contract.
Transmanche says the cost has now risen to Pounds 1.4bn and wants to be paid
in full. It blames Eurotunnel for the way in which it has introduced
contract variations and design changes and says it will make no profit on
the job.
Eurotunnel last year offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn for the works, of which
Pounds 900m was to be in cash and Pounds 300m in shares or some form of
quasi equity. Contractors, themselves under pressure because of recession in
the British and French construction industries, criticised conditions which
prohibited them from immediately turning this paper into much needed cash.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, the British construction group
and a Transmanche shareholder, said on Tuesday: 'The Channel tunnel is a
very difficult owner which frankly does not have the money to pay for what
it is committed to do. We are not anxious to take equity. If we do, we want
it to be saleable within a reasonable period of time and not something that
will only benefit our grandchildren.'
Both sides badly need an agreement. Eurotunnel cannot afford any further
delay in the tunnel's opening date, which would severely damage revenue
projections and increase the amount of extra cash it would need to raise
from shareholders.
Contractors need to settle because they could face a serious drain on their
own depleted cash resources if they have to start funding the contract out
of their own pockets. They also could face claims for damages if they fail
to complete the contract on time.
Both believe they hold the cards necessary to force a victory. Eurotunnel's
confidence is based on:
The fact that Transmanche shareholders, in the absence of a settlement, will
have to start funding some of the cost themselves or stop work leaving them
open to claims for damages.
The construction companies could face claims for damages anyway, under the
terms of the contract, if work is not completed by August 15. Damages could
reach Pounds 240m in a full year. Conversely, says Sir Alastair, contractors
will receive a payment of Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m on completion.
The ability of contractors to damage the project, he says, has been lessened
with the bulk of construction already completed. The first full size train
ran through the tunnel on March 12.
An arbitration ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce means that
Transmanche will not be able to wrap up its demands for extra payments in an
all-embracing claim but will have to justify individual elements separately.
This will be difficult to do and could restrict the amount of money
contractors receive to no more than Pounds 900m at 1985 prices, says Sir
Alastair.
He also argues that contractors, in the absence of a settlement, would be
required by their auditors to make substantial provisions against potential
losses on the contract when they announce their next annual results.
Not surprisingly, British and French contractors perceive it differently.
They see their strengths and Eurotunnel's weaknesses as:
Contractors will need to co-operate closely with Eurotunnel during the
commissioning and testing of the railway if the project's opening is not to
be delayed even further.
The disputes panel, established under the contract, is expected to rule on
the dispute later this year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey,
another Transmanche shareholder, says: 'The panel's decision is binding. If
it finds in our favour, Eurotunnel physically will have to hand the money
over while any appeal is considered by the International Chamber of
Commerce, which could take some time.'
Transmanche, as part of its claim, is seeking time extensions for the work
of up to a year which, if successful, would inhibit Eurotunnel's ability to
levy damages for late completion.
It says that the recent arbitration ruling by the ICC was procedural and
would have no bearing on the size and outcome of its claim, which was
already being considered on a case-by-case basis by the disputes panel.
Some Transmanche shareholders are already making provisions within their
cash flow to fund the works while the conflict rolls on.
Eurotunnel, meanwhile, is sticking to its planned opening date of December
15, although it says its could be either side of Christmas.
Senior executives at Transmanche say privately that the opening cannot occur
until March next year at the earliest and could be delayed until the summer.
The eventual opening date may depend upon what settlement can be reached
between Eurotunnel and Transmanche.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scholl static despite charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLL, the personal healthcare products group, managed to maintain its
pre-tax profits last year despite difficult trading conditions and
exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits were unchanged at Pounds 16.1m after exceptional charges of
Pounds 1.58m to cover disposals and other items. Earnings per share slipped
to 12.1p (13.1p) but the proposed final dividend is increased to 3.7p (3.5p)
making a total of 6.3p (6p).
Turnover at Pounds 151.3m (Pounds 144.4m) was up 4.8 per cent - 2.2 per cent
higher in local currency terms - bolstered by two acquisitions. Those were
the Scholl retail operations in Canada acquired from Schering Plough, and
Gerard House, the UK-based herbal medicines business.
Gross profits increased to Pounds 85.7m (Pounds 83.3m) although gross
margins slipped to 56.7 per cent reflecting the changing business mix and
the increased volume of licensed products.
Profit before tax and exceptional items rose by nearly 10 per cent to Pounds
17.7m (Pounds 16.1m) helped by a full year's interest on the Pounds 24.5m
1991 rights issue proceeds and lower working capital. Net interest income
was Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 360,000) last year.
The exceptional charges, which were expected, covered Pounds 1.99m of costs
associated with the disposal of the Isabelle Lancray subsidiary and six
French/Benelux retail outlets, plus a Pounds 1.06m non-cash adjustment
related to goodwill previously written off to reserves. These were offset by
the release, under the FRS 3 accounting standards, of provisions of Pounds
1.47m held in connection to a 1990 disposal.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said that although 1992 had been a
challenging trading year, the group had succeeded in its objectives of
stabilising turnover, protecting profitability and pursuing its three point
strategy for growth.
This strategy involves brand development, acquiring new businesses and
developing additional licensing and disribution businesses.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Grampian Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAMPIAN Holdings, the Glasgow-based pharmaceuticals, transport and sports
company, announced maintained profits for last year; however, the figures
would have been well down without exceptional profits from the sale of
sporting goods maker Mitre.
Pre-tax profits increased 2 per cent to Pounds 11.4m in the 1992 year.
Excluding a net exceptional gain of Pounds 4.81m, pre-tax profits on
continuing business fell 31 per cent to Pounds 6.64m.
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, said the company suffered from
difficult trading conditions and depressed margins.
Included in the exceptional figure was a loss of Pounds 3.7m to cover
restructuring charges in the Patrick subsidiary. Mr Hughes said further
restructuring moves under way at the pharmaceuticals division would lead to
costs of at least Pounds 1m this year.
Turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 141.3m. The pharmaceuticals
division continued to increase its share of overall group profits, despite a
near 20 per cent fall in the division's profits to Pounds 5.2m.
In the sporting goods division, restructuring and weak consumer demand led
to a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 16,000. The transport
division, affected by lower demand from the construction industry, saw
profits fall from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 1.56m.
Earnings increased 15 per cent to 14.71p (12.77p). Excluding the exceptional
gain, they would have fallen to 7.18p. A second interim dividend of 3.8p
makes an unchanged total for the year of 5.5p.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Central TV hits record Pounds 41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central Independent Television, the second largest ITV company, yesterday
announced a 68 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 41.1m.
The record performance, which benefited from a reduction in Exchequer Levy
worth Pounds 8.5m, gives an early indication of the splits that are likely
to widen this year in the ITV system between companies generating
considerable profits and those who bid high to retain their franchis-es.
Mr Leslie Hill, Central's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I find it
difficult to understand how they (a number of high bidders) will be viable
but that is for them.'
Earnings rose to 94.4p (56.1p). A final dividend of 28p makes a 38p (30.5p)
total.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Survival plan will cost BM some Pounds 42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the troubled construction equipment concern, yesterday announced
details of its survival plan, which will cost nearly Pounds 42m in
redundancies, closures, disposals and write-offs.
Discussions are continuing with its 10 banks over its greatly increased
debt, breaches of covenants on interest cover and net assets and a disposal
programme to relieve the situation.
Bank debt and finance leases stood at Pounds 105m in December.
Interest-paying stock finance and bills of exchange amounted to additional
loans of Pounds 41m. Net assets are likely to be less than Pounds 120m by
the June year-end and gearing near 100 per cent.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since October, said about 1,000 jobs were being
cut from a workforce of 6,900.
Substantial costs arise from putting the pension fund on a more prudent
footing. Nearly Pounds 14m is being deducted from last June's net assets of
Pounds 171m to adjust for deferred tax. This year, the fund's Pounds 41.6m
surplus is being reduced by Pounds 11m, to be taken as part of the Pounds
41.6m exceptional charges. The impact will be partly offset by a tax credit.
Two main disposals are planned to relieve debt.
The disposals and the restructuring would help bring down total borrowings
to about Pounds 114m by December, of which about Pounds 79m would be bank
debt or finance leases.
The group's results for the six months to December 31 were little affected
by the survival tactics, which follow a review by Robert Fleming as the new
merchant bank and Price Waterhouse as the new auditors.
Pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 8.66m (Pounds 17.3m) on sales of Pounds 263.4m
(Pounds 229.3m), which were boosted by Pounds 57.3m from Thomas Robinson,
acquired early last year. In construction equipment sales declined sharply,
especially in the last quarter.
Earnings per share fell to 4.2p (14.9p). The interim dividend is slashed to
0.5p (2.1p).

FT  01 APR 93 / IBM says four big plants are 'surplus'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines says four of its big European manufacturing
sites are surplus to its requirements.
The plants include some of IBM's best known European operations: Havant in
the UK, which makes small memory units; Montpelier in France, which makes
silicon chips and large mainframe computers; Valencia, which makes small
mainframes in Spain; and the printer plant at Jarfalla in Sweden.
The company plans to make these plants 'independent business units', run by
their local managements. The experiment will only continue if the plants can
show themselves capable of returning a satisfactory profit. This plan,
however, was drawn up before the arrival of Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's newly
appointed chairman and chief executive.
He starts his new job today, with a meeting of top managers to review the
state of IBM's operations and the measures it is taking to improve its
performance.
Mr Gerstner is expected to take a more aggressive approach to cost cutting.
The future of the four European plants identified as surplus is therefore
uncertain.
A total of 4,867 jobs at the plants are at stake. In the US, IBM this week
notified some 2,600 workers at its mainframe computer and semiconductor
plants in New York state they have lost their jobs. These are the first
involuntary redundancies in IBM's 79-year history.
An additional 3,400 employees have agreed to take early retirement.
IBM has said it plans to eliminate more than 25,000 jobs worldwide this
year, including 10,000 in Europe, as part of a restructuring plan announced
in January.
However, industry analysts expect Mr Gerstner to increase the target to as
many as 100,000, which would require large scale redundancies throughout
IBM's operations.
IBM's European operations will be under intense pressure to improve their
performance. Last year, IBM made operating profits of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn) in Europe, down from Dollars 3bn the year before. Restructuring
charges, however, forced a loss of Dollars 1.7bn.
Mr Renato Riverso, head of IBM Europe, was not optimistic yesterday about
the region's business prospects for 1993. He was not confident that growth
would return in 1994. He said the original target of 10,000 job cuts in
Europe could be achieved without closing manufacturing plants or forced
redundancies.

FT  01 APR 93 / Company doctor joins Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING Ram, the UK kitchens and bathrooms group whose share price has halved
since an unexpected drop in its profits, yesterday announced the resignation
of its finance director and the appointment of a company doctor as its first
non-executive director.
The departure of Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director for the past two
years, was expected. The appointment of Mr Roy Barber, who has a reputation
for dealing with troubled companies, surprised the City.
Mr Greenwood joined Spring Ram two years ago as its first finance director.
In the past five months, he has had to explain two nasty surprises. False
accounting was discovered at Balterley Bathrooms and belatedly disclosed,
then 1992's pre-tax profit fell nearly Pounds 13m below expectations at
Pounds 26.2m. The company blamed new accounting rules and new demands for a
conservative approach to the figures.
A profits warning was released only a few days before the results were due.
Mr Greenwood's pay was between Pounds 80,000 and Pounds 100,000 a year and
he was on a two-year contract. Details of his severance payment have not
been disclosed.
Spring Ram has also been under institutional pressure to appoint
non-executive directors as a check on its chairman Mr Bill Rooney, who also
effectively acts as chief executive.
The appointment of Mr Barber received a mixed reception. One analyst said he
was not regarded as a 'mainstream' non-executive director.
His early background was as a finance director, for instance at the
construction group Amec. He has since been put into a number of troubled
companies by institutions. The roll includes Astra Holdings, the defence
company which went into receivership, and Thomas Robinson, the engineering
concern acquired by BM Group. The Prudential, which holds 12 per cent of
Spring Ram, knows him from those two.
He has a reputation for toughness and for standing no nonsense. He left
Magnet, the kitchen group which was one of the first big management buy-outs
to run into trouble, in late 1989 after a brief stint because he did not
like what he saw.

FT  01 APR 93 / VW blames loss on failings by management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, plunged into a net loss of DM1.25bn
(Pounds 515m) in the last three months. But the worst is past, and the
company aims to break even by year's-end, according to its chairman.
'I hope we will have a small dividend, but I cannot guarantee it,' said Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chief of the group comprising VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda. The
1992 payout has been cut from DM11 to DM2.
Confronting the worst group crisis and the most difficult market conditions
since the second world war, VW will this year axe almost 20,000 of the
36,000 jobs scheduled to go by the end of 1997. Groupwide short-term
working, which helped cut production by 160,000 to 755,000 units in the
first quarter, will continue at least until the end of June. The main plant
at Wolfsburg, for example, which stopped production for 13 days in the first
quarter, will close down for 17 days in the second.
Mr Piech, who spoke of an 'emergency', blamed management and structural
failings during the boom of the 1980s for most of the group's problems.
'We did not do our homework,' he said. Only a small part of VW's
difficulties could be put down to the cyclical factors that had hit sales.
'Good competitors like our neighbours in France can reach break-even point
with capacity utilisation of less than 70 per cent,' he said.
At VW the comparable figure was down from an unattainable level of more than
100 per cent last year.
The group, which last year saw net earnings plunge 87 per cent to DM147m,
yesterday announced that pre-tax profits had fallen 66 per cent to DM602m.
In the first quarter of this year turnover was down 10 per cent and
deliveries to customers had dropped 11 per cent. Output had shrunk 18 per
cent, according to Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director.
After slumping into a DM563m loss during the last three months of 1992, the
group was still plagued by 'unhappy' market developments.
Outlining the reasoning behind his forecast of a return to break-even this
year, Mr Piech said the result would be helped by a 50 per cent cut to DM6bn
in planned investment. Some DM800m had already been set aside for job cuts.

FT  01 APR 93 / Auction of Pounds 3bn gilts receives strong demand: Bids
made for 1.96 times the bonds offered - Investors cautious on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB

<DATELINE>
   THE Bank of England's biggest-ever auction of government bonds
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 3bn of the new 8 per cent gilt 2013 - was hailed as a roaring success
by dealers, who pointed to strong demand from institutional investors.
Investors themselves, however, remained cautious about medium-term prospects
for the gilts, citing concerns about inflation and the government's
borrowing requirement.
Yesterday's auction is the first since the March 16 Budget announcement
concerning changes to the funding rules and borrowing programme. The market
had been nervous that investor appetite for such a large amount of stock
might prove weak.
In the event, dealers said, the relatively high 'cover' - the ratio of bids
to the amount offered - of 1.96 times, and the very narrow range of
successful bids suggested there was good demand for the stock.
UK institutions said the success of this auction was not necessarily a guide
to the prospects for the rest of the year.
'The auction was very well covered, which is constructive for the market,
but there will be another auction next month, and yet another one the month
after,' said Mr Mark Rimmer, fund manager at Gartmore.
He expects long-term interest rates to rise over the next year, reflecting
concern about inflation, while short-term rates fall to stimulate the
economy.
One of the big fund management groups, which asked not to be named, said:
'Our attitude to the gilt market is one of caution with the exception of the
short end, where the possibility of further cuts in the base rate may boost
prices for two- and three-year gilts. We didn't participate in the auction
because we feel the market is over-valued and that expectations of higher
inflation have not been priced in. Furthermore, the prospect of heavy supply
is very worrying.'
Not all investors are so bearish about inflation prospects. Another UK fund
management group said: 'We think the long end looks good value in relation
to inflation, and we think that the market is too pessimistic in its
inflation forecasts. We also expect to see more retail investors buying
gilts as returns on savings accounts remain unattractive.'

FT  01 APR 93 / London consolidates lead in foreign currency trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of foreign currency trading conducted out of London is now so
substantial that more US dollars and D-Marks are traded in the City than in
either the US or Germany.
The volume of currency trading throughout the world grew sharply between
1989 and 1992, with an increasing proportion of deals being done in the
D-Mark, according to a report issued yesterday by the Bank for International
Settlements.
The report, which is the most comprehensive survey ever made of activity in
the foreign exchange market, confirmed that London remains the world's
largest centre for foreign exchange, accounting for more than a quarter of
all turnover in currencies.
Yesterday's report by the BIS, outlined an inquiry into foreign exchange
dealing conducted by 26 central banks last year. The survey showed that
global net turnover in the world's foreign exchange markets grew 42 per cent
between 1989 and 1992, reaching an estimated Dollars 880bn (Pounds 585bn)
per business day in April 1992.
In spite of the increase, these figures represented a slowing in turnover
growth, compared with the three years between 1986 and 1989. However, there
was a strong increase in the number of transactions in currency futures and
options in these years.
According to the report, the dollar remains the single most widely traded
currency in the world, accounting for seven out of 10 reported transactions.
The D-Mark is now the second most widely traded currency, being involved in
38 per cent of all currency deals.
'The evidence strongly suggests that its (the D-Mark's) importance rose
sharply between 1989 and 1992 at the expense of the dollar,' the BIS said.
In Luxembourg, Ireland, Austria and Portugal, trading of the local currency
against the D-Mark now exceeds local currency transactions against the
dollar.
London's predominance in foreign exchange trading was confirmed: it
accounted for 27 per cent of net world turnover, compared with 25 per cent
in 1989. 'The amount of foreign currency business conducted out of London is
so great that domestic currency transactions account for less than a quarter
of total trading there,' BIS says.

FT  01 APR 93 / Spring Ram appoints company doctor to board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING Ram, the UK kitchens and bathrooms group whose share price has halved
since an unexpected drop in its profits, yesterday announced the resignation
of its finance director and the appointment of a company doctor as its first
non-executive director.
The departure of Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director for the past two
years, was expected. The appointment of Mr Roy Barber, who has a reputation
for dealing with troubled companies, came as more of a surprise to the City.
Mr Greenwood joined Spring Ram two years ago as its first finance director.
In the past five months, he has had to explain two nasty surprises to the
City. First, false accounting was discovered at Balterley Bathrooms and
belatedly disclosed. Second, 1992's pre-tax profit fell nearly Pounds 13m
below expectations at Pounds 26.2m. The company blamed new accounting rules
and new demands for a conservative approach to the figures.
A profits warning was released only a few days before the results were due,
after much haggling with auditors Arthur Andersen.
Mr Greenwood's pay was between Pounds 80,000 and Pounds 100,000 a year and
he was on a two-year contract. Details of his severance payment have not
been disclosed.
Spring Ram has also been under institutional pressure to appoint
non-executive directors as a check on its ebullient chairman Mr Bill Rooney,
who also effectively acts as chief executive.
The appointment of Mr Barber received a mixed reception. One analyst said he
was not regarded as a 'mainstream' non-executive director.
His early background was as a finance director, for instance at the
construction group Amec. He has since been put into a number of troubled
companies by institutions. The roll includes Astra Holdings, the defence
company which went into receivership while undergoing a DTI inquiry, and
Thomas Robinson, the engineering concern acquired by BM Group. The
Prudential, which holds 12 per cent of Spring Ram, knows him from those two.
He has a reputation for toughness and for standing no nonsense. He left
Magnet, the kitchen group which was one of the first big management buy-outs
to run into trouble, in late 1989 after a brief stint because he did not
like what he saw.

FT  01 APR 93 / Queens Moat shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Queens Moat Houses, the UK's second biggest hotel group, were
suspended yesterday at the company's request as it announced it was
postponing a Pounds 7m dividend payment.
Queens Moat had been due to report results next Wednesday. and yesterday's
move raised fears in the market about them. A statement from the company
said that the share suspension was 'pending clarification of the company's
financial position'.
The group has heavy debts, taken on to finance expansion. They are given as
Pounds 927m in the accounts for 1991, but forecast to go over Pounds 1bn for
1992 by some analysts. This would give gearing close to 100 per cent.
The company has a large amount of D-Mark denominated debt which has been
affected by sterling's devaluation. Analysts had been forecasting final
pre-tax profits of around Pounds 85m.
Queens Moat shares have mirrored the fall in the leisure sector. They hit an
all-time low of 27.5p in August after its debt levels surprised the City and
have since climbed to yesterday's suspension level of 47 1/2 p. Ten months
ago they were 92p.
At the beginning of February Mr Martin Marcus, Queens Moat's deputy
chairman, sold 1.1m shares for Pounds 629,500, the day before the company
went into its closed period ahead of the results.
Mr Marcus said then that he had sold the shares to fulfil personal
obligations and that the transaction was not related to any aspect of the
group's performance.
Queens Moat Houses recently extended an agreement with Bass under which the
former will convert four of its UK hotels and four on the European continent
into Holiday Inns.
Yesterday's dividend payment was deferred on the 7.5 per cent convertible
cumulative redeemable preference shares. Trading was also halted in all
classes of convertible and debenture stock.
Investors expressed concern yesterday about a further interest payment of
Pounds 11m due today on the company's Pounds 215m 10 1/4 per cent debenture
stock.
At the last independent valuation, in December 1991, the properties backing
the debenture were valued at Pounds 377m, though UK hotel prices are
estimated to have fallen by 20-30 per cent since then.

FT  01 APR 93 / E German employers pull out of steelworkers wage deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WAGE PARITY between east and west German workers moved further away
yesterday after steel industry employers pulled out of an agreement with
unions.
Employees in steel, electrical and engineering, which make up the three main
sectors of the east German economy, have been hit by the employers' refusal
to pay steelworkers a 21 per cent wage increase which was due today.
IG Metall, the giant engineering union, responded by calling for warning
strikes throughout eastern Germany in protest against the action.
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, voted to end a
contract made with IG Metall and east German managers in March 1991.
The contract, also agreed with Gesamtmetall, the electrical and metal
employers' association, would have brought eastern German wages up to
western German levels by April 1994.
Gesamtmetall, which had been due to pay eastern German electrical and metal
employees a 26 per cent wage increase today, had broken the contract in
early March on the grounds that eastern Germany's economy had sharply
deteriorated. IG Metall earlier this week called for warning strikes in the
metal and electrical sectors.
Officials from both employers' associations yesterday said they could not
afford to pay such wage increases in view of low productivity levels - about
70 per cent below west German levels.
'We propose to offer the employees a 9 per cent increase, which is in line
with inflation in eastern Germany,' said Mr Philipp Vossen, a spokesman for
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl.
He added: 'Our decision ends the timetable towards income parity. The
present wage demands would have slowed down any future investment plans.'
IG Metall officials yesterday denied that their wage demands, and the threat
of an all-out strike later in the month, would postpone growth, and slow
investment in east Germany.
'We cannot ask our members in eastern Germany to accept low wages, but pay
western German prices,' said Mr Gerd Schulz, an IG Metall representative.
The threat of strikes in eastern Germany arising from high wage demands
coincided with the publication of a joint report issued by the German
Institute for Economic Forecasting in Berlin and the Institute for World
Economy in Kiel.
The report showed how high wage demands, linked to continuing low
productivity, would depress growth, stem investment, and stifle the
fledgling small and medium sized enterprises in eastern Germany. 'Wage costs
are the Achilles heel of the eastern German economy,' says the report,
adding that there is hardly any gap between labour costs and output per
head.

FT  01 APR 93 / China steps up pressure on Britain over Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA STEPPED up the pressure in its diplomatic row with Britain yesterday,
renewing its warnings over trade relations and taking further steps towards
setting up a shadow authority for Hong Kong.
Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, said at the end of a meeting of the
National People's Congress, that Sino-British trade could suffer because of
the plans by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to introduce greater
democracy in the colony.
He also said China was establishing a preparatory committee to facilitate a
smooth transition to Chinese rule over Hong Kong in 1997, and hinted that it
might be set up earlier than expected.
Western officials and figures in the Hong Kong democratic reform movement
fear that China may be planning to establish a shadow government in Hong
Kong to compete with Britain in the lead-up to China's takeover in 1997.
This would undermine the position of Mr Patten, who will hold talks with
senior EC officials in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday before flying to
London to meet UK prime minister Mr John Major.
On trade, Mr Li said: 'I hope that our economic relations would not be
seriously affected.' But he added: 'If the situation continues to
deteriorate, I'm afraid we can't entirely rule out the possibility of
economic co-operation being affected.'
Mr Li Lanqing, vice-premier and former trade minister, issued a similar
threat last month.
Mr Li Peng, whose second five-year term in office was confirmed by the
Congress, China's parliament, also sought to use a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds
840m) trade deal reached this week with Germany, covering the purchase of at
least 12 Airbuses and other equipment, to exert pressure on Britain.
'That shows what a huge market China can offer,' Mr Li told reporters in
Beijing. 'I believe that British businessmen will also be interested in such
a big market.'
Beijing has been infuriated by the planned reforms advanced by Mr Patten,
which it claims are at odds with understandings reached earlier with London.
Mr Li hinted that an original plan to form the working committee in 1996 may
be brought forward in the light of difficulties with Britain.
Mr Li was equivocal in remarks to reporters about timing, saying that the
purpose of the preparatory committee was to ensure a smooth transition to
Chinese rule to preserve Hong Kong's prosperity. 'According to our original
plan we should establish a preparatory committee in 1996,' he said. The
congress's working committee on Hong Kong would decide when it might be
established.
Politicians in the colony expressed disquiet at Beijing's apparent intention
to push ahead with the committee.

FT  01 APR 93 / UK acts against Islamic bank: Concern at Bank of England -
Pounds 83m will go back to depositors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONLY bank in Europe run on Islamic principles announced yesterday that
it is to stop taking deposits and return Pounds 83m to 10,000 depositors
after failing to resolve a dispute with the Bank of England over how it
should be supervised.
The London-based Albaraka International Bank, wholly owned by a Saudi
sheikh, said the Bank of England was concerned it could not be supervised in
line with international standards because of its structure.
The Bank is thought to have been worried in the wake of the collapse of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International that the controlling management of
Albaraka appeared to be in Saudi Arabia although it did not operate as a
bank there.
The move, which follows the administration of Equatorial Bank and the
winding up of the Mount Banking Corporation last October, further reduces
the number of banks which specialise in lending to Asian businesses in
Britain.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said he was 'very concerned'
that banks serving Asians in Britain were ceasing to trade. Mr Vaz called
for a select committee inquiry into the supervision of such banks.
Albaraka is one of 22 banks owned by Dallah Albaraka Group, the Jeddah-based
family holding company of Sheikh Saleh Abdullah Kamel. It operates in
accordance with Moslem law by not charging interest on loans, but instead
adopting the Islamic murabaha practice of making set transaction profits.
The bank, which has assets of Pounds 191m, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds
6.8m in 1991 after making Pounds 6.7m provisions against bad debts. Sheikh
Kamel, sole owner of a number of businesses with a combined asset value of
Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn), injected Pounds 15m of new capital.
Sheikh Kamel said yesterday that he hoped the Bank would accept a new
ownership structure he intended to propose in June, under which other
British shareholders would dilute his shareholding to below 10 per cent.
'For me, it is not important how much of the bank I own. The most important
think is to enable Moslems to practise their religion in their business and
to show that there are good things in Islam,' said Sheikh Kamel.
He said the bank had been negotiating with the Bank of England's supervision
department since the adoption of the Basle concordat in July, which called
for consolidated supervision of banks operating in several countries.
Sheikh Kamel said Albaraka had offered to bring in other Islamic banks as
shareholders, or to accept the Bank of England as its consolidated
supervisor, but all its suggestions had been rejected.
The Bank said it could not comment on its supervision of individual banks.

<TEXT>
It would be rash to draw too many conclusions for the hotel sector from the
troubles of Queens Moat. The company has always had a weakness for taking on
new properties. That explains its past propensity for rights issues and its
present heavy indebtedness. It may be that its German expansion, which
seemed such an advantage at the height of the UK recession, is catching up
with it. Investors will clearly have to wait a while to find out. Meanwhile
they must envy the good fortune of Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, who
sold 1.1m shares to meet personal obligations at an average price of just
over 57p before the company entered its closed season in February. That
compares with a suspension price of 47 1/2 p.

FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: CarnaudMetalbox
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's largest packaging company is being gripped by a two-way pull, as
its annual results make clear. CarnaudMetalbox is not deriving much
sustenance from difficult markets but it is capable of living off its own
fat. Greater operating efficiencies stemming from extensive cost cutting,
combined with lower interest and tax charges, produced a 15 per cent gain in
net income despite a 3 per cent fall in sales.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, believes there are more
internally-generated improvements to come, likening the packaging industry's
stage of evolution to that of automotive parts manufacturers in the
mid-1970s. Modernising manufacturing methods and squeezing excessive working
capital should yield substantial benefits. But softening European economies
and severe overcapacity in the beverage can market will hamper the company's
best efforts.
CarnaudMetalbox's two largest shareholders seem divided about its prospects.
MB-Caradon's preparations to sell its 25.3 per cent stake suggest an element
of doubt. But CGIP is aiming to raise its stake by another 7 per cent. In
truth, this divergence of opinion may reflect little more than the differing
time horizons of British and French investors. Other shareholders should
perhaps also balance the likelihood of short-term share price softness with
longer-term appreciation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Volkswagen's share price seems a relaxed
response to a DM1.25bn first quarter loss. Without a further breakdown the
bare loss is difficult to interpret. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the new chairman,
needs an atmosphere of crisis to force through change. Yet his comment that
VW should break even this year seems at odds with the warning of worse pain
to come.
The 30 per cent rise in the shares since December suggests the market is
convinced VW's problems are being addressed. The promise of up to 20,000 job
cuts this year is tougher than before. The hard-hitting procurement team
recruited from General Motors should rationalise VW's sprawling supply base.
But the traffic is not all one-way. Even allowing Mr Piech some licence,
selling cars in Germany will be tough this year and next. The devaluation of
the Italian lira has cost VW competitiveness in its second biggest market.
Its reputation as the top quality producer among European volume car
manufacturers no longer goes unchallenged.

FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's gilt auction turned out more successful than the authorities
could have dared hope. One can discount the high cover ratio: it may simply
reflect rogue bids designed to pick up paper on the cheap. The minimal
difference between the highest accepted price and the average is a different
matter. That points to solid demand.
Perhaps UK institutions have decided that the inflationary outlook is good
enough to make an 8.5 per cent yield on long-dated paper attractive. There
must be some who feared that, even with the more frequent auctions, the
opportunity to buy long-dated gilts will not come up that often. Perhaps,
too, the market had been deliberately oversold since the budget by traders
looking for cheap auction stock.
The danger is that an element of the demand came from fickle sources like
international hedge funds attracted by the steep UK yield curve. If so, the
authorities should beware. With this auction under its belt, together with
sales to banks and calls on existing issues, it could start the new
financial year with getting on for Pounds 10bn already covered. That is good
for confidence, but there is a long way to go.

FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Quest for fair value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be a minor miracle if the Accounting Standards Board's latest
discussion document provokes nothing more heated than talk. The proposal to
outlaw balance sheet provisions for post-acquisition costs will make it far
more difficult for acquisitive companies to show steady earnings growth. If
the ASB gets its way, the cost of restructuring an acquired company in
future will be charged squarely against profits as an exceptional item.
That should be good for transparency. The right to make fair-value
adjustments on acquisition has been open to widespread abuse. All manner of
costs and anticipated losses have been dressed up as balance sheet
liabilities. With acquired goodwill also written off against reserves, the
cost of acquisitions has often passed without touching the profit and loss.
Since businesses that have not just changed hands have to take
rationalisation costs on the chin, that hardly makes for a level playing
field between predators and prey.
Under the ASB proposals, investors will still have to decide whether to
include exceptional post-acquisition costs when adjusting the volatile
earnings figures which arise from FRS3. But such costs should surely be
regarded as a normal business expense for companies which make a habit of
takeovers, and therefore a legitimate component of earnings. Whether this
attitude would discourage speculative takeovers or depress asset values -
including the share prices of potential takeover targets - remains an open
question. Meanwhile companies such as Tomkins, which has yet to announce
fair value provisions following its acquisition of RHM, must decide whether
to toe the ASB line or take a stand in favour of the old rules.

FT  01 APR 93 / Tax change may cost 10,000 N Sea oil jobs, says Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH SEA oil industry could lose 10,000 jobs in the next two to three
years, according to government estimates if planned changes to petroleum
revenue taxes go ahead.
The Treasury's worst estimate for the effect of the tax changes on North Sea
activity is that exploration will halve. But the new PRT rules will generate
Pounds 700m in the first three years which the government believes will more
than offset the potential job losses.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that the rate of
PRT would drop from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for established oilfields.
For new fields it would be abolished. But in future companies will be unable
to claim tax allowances for spending on exploration and appraisal work.
The changes have been attacked by many oil companies which claim the
government is sounding a death knell for exploration in the North Sea.
Drilling companies have estimated job losses as high as 39,000. But the
industry has also been split between winners and losers.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, yesterday defended the decision to
change the North Sea tax rules amid strong opposition from some oil
companies. The Treasury believes that the existing regime has caused oil
companies to run inefficient exploration programmes funded by the taxpayer.
The changes would force companies to become more efficient and would not
affect overall oil production, Mr Dorrell said.
He said the changes were part of government plans to streamline the tax
system and establish low marginal tax rates.
The government is ensuring that 'those who commit resources are making their
own judgments about the economic value of their decisions and when they
invest in activities which prove to be successful they are entitled to the
lion's share of the return', he said. The Treasury is likely to resist any
pressure for transitional relief for some of the smaller exploration
companies hit hardest by the tax changes.
If companies had entered into contracts for drilling wells at the time of
the Budget statement, they can continue to claim PRT relief for the work.
But obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry by companies
applying for exploration licences will not qualify for relief. This has led
to threats by several oil companies to pull out of the government's latest
North Sea licensing round.

FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: G7's Russian gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RUSSIA, amid the turmoil and confusion which has characterised the past
fortnight, two conclusions can be drawn with some certainty. First, the
threat of hyperinflation is growing by the day. Second, Russia's apparently
reform-minded government cannot hope to restore some semblance of economic
and political stability, and start to restructure the economy, unless it
receives substantial western financial help as soon as reforms begin.
Western governments are right to be cautious. But they must be ready and
willing to act decisively if the balance shifts decisively in the reformers'
favour.
For the moment, the west is right to limit its support to words. The
unstable balance of power between President Boris Yeltsin and his opponents
make it doubtful that the reformers have the political clout to pursue
reform, even with external aid. Nor can the parliamentarians planned April
25 referendum, in its current unrealistic form, or President Boris Yeltsin's
alternative plebiscite, be relied on to resolve this power struggle.
Even after 18 months of Mr Yeltsin's rule, the central bank remains opposed
to reform. Despite calls for resignations at the bank from Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Fyodorov, it is still increasing credit at the rate of 20 per
cent a month, financing the budget deficit and keeping enterprises afloat at
the expense of accelerating inflation.
Yet while western governments are right to be cautious, they would be wrong
to be inactive. The success of the reformers' draft programme will depend as
much on the organisation and resolve of the western members of the Group of
Seven industrialised countries as on the reformers. The west should use the
coming weeks to draw up a joint economic strategy with Mr Fyodorov and his
team, and arrange multilateral funds which can be disbursed quickly once the
programme begins.
This requires a shift in western strategy. The G7 and the International
Monetary Fund have spent the past year waiting for the Russian government to
establish a track record before releasing notionally available aid. This
strategy is misconceived. The Russian government can only bring inflation
under control by halving the flow of central bank credits. But this can only
occur, in the absence of alternative sources of finance, through huge cuts
in social spending or mass unemployment, neither of which are politically
conceivable.
Only with up-front western aid, in the region of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn
over the next three months, can the government bring inflation under
control. This aid should only be disbursed when the G7 governments are
confident that the central bank has stemmed the flow of credits to
enterprises. And future aid flows, preferably conditional on deeper economic
reforms, must be cut off if the government fails to meet its budgetary
targets. But only by filling the budget gap, and thus stabilising the
exchange rate, can the Russian government persuade investors to hold roubles
rather than dollars and stem the flight of capital to Swiss bank accounts.
This is the enlightened, if risky, strategy. The alternative is for the G7
to procrastinate, using the caution of the rule-bound IMF as an excuse for
its inaction while the reforms wither. The west's reputation in Russia will
then deteriorate further, leaving Europe to deal with the fall-out from
Russia's inevitable and dangerous journey through hyperinflation to
political disintegration.

FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: Local councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S INTRODUCTION of the new council tax for funding local authority
expenditure is notable for the absence of controversy. The advent of its
predecessor, the poll tax, was marked by non-payment campaigns, civil
disobedience and even riots. It created chaos in many town halls, choked
some courts with enforcement proceedings and contributed to the downfall of
Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Against the gloomier prognostications of critics, the
council tax seems to have enjoyed a relatively painless birth, ushering in a
period of truce between central and local government which is sorely needed.
Both sides can claim credit for this. Local government has been determined
to make the new system work, despite misgivings about the complexities of
discounts for single-adult households. Council leaders have recognised that
they were drinking in the last chance saloon: the continuing independence of
local government could not survive another poll tax fiasco. They have also
strained to keep spending increases down - with only three councils said to
be in danger of capping for over-spending.
The government's contribution was in designing a system which is more
convincing about its fairness than the poll tax ever could be. It also
defies attempts to produce headline figures for the new tax, leaving most
people blissfully unaware about whether they would be better-off or poorer
as a result. A relatively inexpensive transitional relief scheme has limited
the increases paid by households this year to between Pounds 1.75 and Pounds
3.50 a week. And stringent spending limits have been imposed on councils to
ensure that the change in local taxation has not meant a leap in bills. The
lessons of the poll tax were well learnt in Whitehall.
This apparently painless transition to the new tax coincides with other
signs of an improving relationship between central and local government.
Ministers have spent much of the last year signalling an end to the
hostilities of the 1980s. Councils have become more entrepreneurial in using
the discipline of contracting-out to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of their services.
Power continues to move towards the centre with the recently announced
police reforms and the increase in schools opting-out of local authority
control. Today also sees more than 550 further education, tertiary and
sixth-form colleges pass out of local authority control, becoming
independent bodies funded directly by the government. However, the movement
of power is not all one-way: responsibility for care in the community is
passing down to councils, also from today. This offers local government an
excellent opportunity to demonstrate their ability to deliver vital services
locally. It should not be fumbled, whatever councils' misgivings over the
funding.
Further challenges lie ahead, including the reorganisation of local
government to provide a single local council for every part of the country.
The tax base of local authorities needs to be extended, since the council
tax will raise less than a quarter of the money they spend. This gearing
means that small increases in spending require the sort of huge increases in
local taxation which so discredited the poll tax.
However, further change should be gradual and incremental. A period of
stability is needed in local government, not least to clear up the mess left
by the poll tax. A decade of warfare between town halls and Whitehall has
profoundly damaged local government. Repairing local democracy will need
care and skill if its political legitimacy is to be restored.

FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: Hoover's dust-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER'S DISMISSAL of three senior executives allocates responsibility for a
promotional campaign so disastrously managed that it promises to live on as
a cautionary tale in business textbooks.
The errors included designing a scheme so generous that it was bound to
attract enormous interest - Hoover offered a prize in free air tickets worth
more than the promoted appliance itself. Then the arrangements for
distributing tickets crumbled as local managers and their agents struggled
to contain the emerging and unsustainable financial liability.
Once inside this hole, Hoover continued digging. It became surly with the
press and denied a catastrophe which was in full public view well before
Christmas. It has taken head office in the US four months to order a change
in tack.
In these days when brands are traded like any other asset, this suggests
another point. Hoover has acquired its reputation for reliability over
decades - that is why even a too-good-to-be-true offer was credible to
consumers.
Maytag, which bought Hoover in 1989, is an established US appliance maker
which should know all about maintaining brand value. On this occasion,
however, it appears to have been driven by the recession to focus on
improved financial performance at the expense of common sense and in
violation of a core value for consumer companies: plain-dealing and
integrity. The damage to the Hoover brand is certainly greater than the
Dollars 30m charge to be taken against profits. Even in the most
decentralised and entrepreneurial company, head office needs to disgorge
more than financial targets.

FT  01 APR 93 / Personal View: Budget makes waves in the North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN LOVEGROVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Budget, the chancellor revealed plans to make changes to the North
Sea tax system, changes which are fundamental and came without warning. The
question that has to be asked is, are these proposed tax changes bad for the
nation which, after all, owns the oil and gas reserves? The answer is yes,
if they remain unmodified, although not necessarily for the reasons that
some oil companies have been giving.
The most aired argument has been that the proposed abolition of petroleum
revenue tax (PRT) relief for exploration will significantly reduce drilling
activity. This is undeniable, but is it bad for the nation? No. Over the
past few years the likely return on total exploration expenditures, pre-tax,
will prove to be negative.
What has saved those more technically lax companies has been the fact that
the government has been paying between 75p and 83p in the pound for most of
their drilling through tax reliefs. The change in the rules should force
some of the companies to become more technically focused, and appreciate
more fully high-quality acreage and explorations.
If the industry really wishes to argue the point about drilling, it should
concentrate on the unemployment that will be created by the fall in
activity. For if the abolition of the tax relief on drilling occurs as
suddenly as is currently proposed, the loss of jobs within a year could be
measured in thousands.
For their part, some politicians might argue that the reduction in the rate
of PRT on existing fields will give the oil companies a windfall profit. It
is true to say that the income to companies from PRT-paying fields will
increase, but this is generally no bad thing. It should ensure that many
fields are kept in production for longer than they might have been
previously. Equally importantly, the government's share of the cost of
abandoning fields will fall as a result of the rate reduction.
Why, then, are these changes bad for the nation? Simply put, they introduce
considerable uncertainty to an industry which is characterised by lead times
that can be measured in numbers of government life-times. Inevitably, this
will reduce the attractiveness of the North Sea compared with a growing list
of countries elsewhere that compete for the industry's money.
One specific concern is obligation wells. When a company is awarded a
licence by the government, it agrees to drill a certain number of wells in
order to test the prospectiveness of that acreage. Implicitly, such an
agreement is made under the assumption that tax laws of the time will remain
unchanged. To change the laws after the licence award, but before such wells
are drilled, is an effective breach of the underlying terms of contract.
Unless the government redresses this position, it runs the serious risk of
the companies paying less attention to the licensing authorities in the
future. Given the increase of opportunities elsewhere, the government should
realise that, longer term, it will need the companies more than they will
need it.
While one solution might be for the government to waive all current
obligation wells, another would be to allow companies to relieve the cost of
obligation wells against PRT, provided such costs are spent within two
years. This is in line with government treatment for wells that are are
already contracted. It would also ensure the wells are drilled and allow the
unemployment that will be linked to the slowdown in exploration to be phased
in over a longer period.
Another concern is the abolition of PRT on new fields. While the great
majority of new fields would not have paid PRT, one has to wonder whether a
later government will allow those companies lucky enough to develop large
fields to take home the operating income net only of corporation tax, the
full rate of which is currently 33 per cent. From my perspective I would
have to say that there is no chance of this happening. The real danger is
that PRT will be reintroduced, or that royalty will no longer be waived or
that some new form of tax will be designed. The government should,
therefore, keep PRT alive for these new fields. It is a flexible, fair and
known tax system.
With the North Sea now well into maturity, it is right for the government to
consider making some changes to the fiscal regime, and the direction that it
is now proposing is the correct one. It should, however, be more ethical in
the phasing-in of the abolition of the exploration relief, and should
reconsider the idea of abolishing PRT for new fields. Failure to make these
changes will result in a gradual run-down of this important domestic
industry.

Meanwhile there's a certain reflection of Oscar Wilde in yesterday's report
on improving the EC's public image. It was Wilde, of course, who depicted
foxhunters as 'the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable'.
Besides criticising the European Commission for using obscure language, the
report advises against trying to explain the Maastricht treaty to the
populace because 'treaty decisions are far too technical and too removed
from daily life for people to understand'. A case of 'the incomprehensible
in retreat from the inexplicable'.

provoked an uproar from Marco Tronchetti Provera. The ad was never seen
again and the subsidiary sold.
But the cleansing is only skin deep. With a placing for its shares in
Continental, the bigger German rival it had tried unsuccessfully to buy in
1990, possibly only hours away, Pirelli yesterday unveiled a heavily
suggestive new TV advertising campaign featuring 'Basic Instinct' star
Sharon Stone.

When 19,000 BT employees cleared their desks for the last time one day last
July, the main union representing them described the redundancy package it
had negotiated as 'one of the best in the UK'.
Indeed, the deal was so attractive that the union, the National
Communications Union, has now decided to offer it to its own employees. But
even BT was unable to offer the proportion of redundancies being made by the
union; up to one-third of the NCU's 160 staff are likely to be leaving.
With the loss of 30,000 members last year and the prospect of another 30,000
over the next two years, the union says it would have been heading for an
annual Pounds 2m loss without the staff cuts.
BT's redundancy programme led to the coining of 'compulsory retention' as
part of the industrial relations lexicography. When BT discovered that the
deal was 50 per cent oversubscribed many employees were disappointed to
discover that they had to stay. With low morale and high pay-offs, the NCU
could find itself in the same position.

Stand firm the Brits. Although the Royal Navy is no longer able to put
foreigners in their place, the police remain ever ready. Witness the
limousine whose journey from Heathrow airport to London was blocked by an
eagle-eyed traffic patrolman who lengthily grilled the chauffeur about why
he wasn't wearing his seat-belt.
The man in the back took the delay not only patiently but in good humour -
so much so that one of the officers snatched open the rear door and told him
to wipe the smile off his face or he'd be nicked as well.
He happened to be Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the European Community's new
commissioner for the internal market, on his way to Whitehall for meetings
with ministers.
Perhaps he'll mention the incident when he addresses Euro-MPs this morning.
His subject is easing checks on Europeans travelling between Community
countries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
High Street retailing is the sort of business which lends itself to a heavy
turnover in chief executives. Most recently, Kingfisher lost its finance
director, Archie Norman, to Asda while Sears poached Liam Strong from
British Airways. Retailing thrives on fresh blood.
However, the transfer market in CEOs tends to be dictated by adversity. It's
hard to remember the last time that one apparently well-run retailer poached
a chief executive from another. Hence the interest in Alan Smith's move from
Marks and Spencer to the chief executive's chair at Kingfisher.
In one respect it's surprising that more M&amp;S chieftains have not defected
before. Smith is 52 and has been on the board since 1978. He is only one of
17 executive directors and, however good he is, it's unlikely that he will
ever get a shot at the top job at M&amp;S. Sir Rick Greenbury, 56, has only been
doing the job for a couple of years and is surrounded by capable types.
Hence the attraction of Kingfisher. It is Britain's fourth biggest store
group and in terms of its 60,000 staff is a similar size to M&amp;S. Smith, a
well-respected retailer, will have a chance to run his own show at last.
Or will he? One has only to look at companies such as Glaxo and Tate and
Lyle to see that imported chief executives can have a relatively short shelf
life when working for a strong executive chairman. Kingfisher's executive
chairman, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, will be almost as much on probation as the
new boy.

FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Londoners facing dangers of increasing
disenfranchisement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor JULIE FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is indeed the case that, increasingly, many of us in London local
government are looking to the rest of Europe for inspiration as we ponder
the bleak future for the town halls on offer from the government ('Too many
bodies spoil the broth', March 29).
Taking the Channel tunnel rail link terminus as just one example, Camden
Council, the planning authority for the area, suggested at the outset that
the viability of St Pancras should be studied along with other options. A
joint planning process might well have brought us to what seems now to be
the current conclusion without several years' delay and costs incurred.
But the government continues to combine extreme centralist tendencies -
London policy co-ordinated by a secret cabinet subcommittee - with an ironic
embrace of corporatism in London First and London Forum, and quango-isation.
Quangos with minimal elected membership now control Pounds 7.5bn-worth of
public money in London and nationally administer more public resources that
the local government sector.
The government opposes council representation on London Forum despite the
fact that it will take under its wing the London Tourist Board, which
receives Pounds 300,000 annually from local authorities through the London
Boroughs Grants Committee. Police authority proposals further weaken council
representation, and the important Maastricht measure specifying seats for
councillors on the committee of the regions was dismissed by ministers as a
'technical' issue only.
Where should Europe point us? Towards public-private partnership at local
level, towards decentralisation and 'subsidiarity', but above all towards a
recognition of the role of local government as more than a collection of
agencies for Whitehall administering nationally funded services.
In Britain we are too afraid of pluralist decision-making, of the
complexities created by recognising the rights of representation, democratic
accountability and open government. But the dangers of disenfranchisement
are greater, and all Londoners will be the worse for it.

FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Success of warehouse clubs in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The fundamental success of the warehouse clubs in the US is based on a
number of key factors ('Superstores under threat', March 24). They have
hypermarket-type advantages of scale and cost efficiencies. They have the
unique advantage of mixing trade (wholesale) and consumer retail sales. With
very high labour productivity and cheap rents, the clubs can afford to live
on 10 to 12 per cent gross margins.
The clubs are a type of larger second-generation out-of-town Kwik Save or
Aldi, with a wider range of foods and non-foods. Their ultimate strength is
more as a retail discounter than a wholesaler. Their competitive positioning
in the UK, assuming retail planning consents, is more a threat to retail
superstores/discounters than to cash-and-carry wholesaling.
The UK cash-and-carry sector, carrying a very full (rather than limited)
food range, can operate on 5 to 7 per cent gross margins and is already on
best or near-best supplier buying terms. Clubs needing more margin will not
always stock brand leaders, and will not initially have a UK critical mass
of buying power. On a straight retail discount basis, the estimate of 30
units in 10 years can be multiplied by at least a factor of two.

THE STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIA
Power and Change in the Democratic Revolution
By Ruslan Khasbulatov, edited by Richard Sakwa
Routledge, Pounds 19.99, 270 pages
In the theatre of the absurd that passes for Russian politics these days, no
actor cuts a figure as surreal or paradoxical as parliamentary speaker
Ruslan Khasbulatov.
Stalwart defender of the constitutional order against totalitarian threats,
or demagogic standard-bearer of the old communist guard? Dangerous
reactionary bent on sabotaging reform and unseating the president, or
pragmatic coalition-builder groping for a consensual way out of Russia's
multiple crises? At various times during the session of the Congress of
People's Deputies that ended in confusion on Monday, Khasbulatov was accused
of playing all these roles. And while he emerged claiming victory over
Yeltsin, this was only after the speaker had survived a serious attempt in
Congress to dismiss him.
This book - a mixture of personal memoir and political and economic musings
put together over the past 18 months - is Khasbulatov's first attempt to
explain himself to an English-speaking public. As such its publication could
hardly be more timely. Stodgily written and sometimes less than clear, it
does create a more rounded picture of the man than has hitherto been
available. But it also serves to deepen the confusion surrounding the Moscow
power struggle in which he has, for now at least, become a central player.
Are he and the forces he claims to represent really the nub of President
Yeltsin's political problem, to be wished away through a popular vote of
confidence on April 25? Or are they likely to prove an essential part of any
constitutional solution? The question has posed itself insistently in the 15
months since Khasbulatov's Congress started to challenge Yeltsin's
government and its economic reforms. And it is one to which Yeltsin himself
still appears unsure of the answer, even as he prepares to do open battle
with parliament for public support.
What does emerge clearly enough from these pages is that the image of
Khasbulatov which Yeltsin and his supporters have painted in their more
headstrong moments is a caricature. The parliament speaker may be a
political opportunist but he is not exactly a Stalinist of the old school,
yearning for restoration of the centralised Soviet state and actively
plotting with other members of the nomenklatura to achieve it.
True, he is a product of the communist career ladder: from his birth as an
ethnic Chechen in the town of Grozny and his childhood in forced exile in
Kazakhstan, making his way up through the Komsomol youth organisation and
into academe before being elected - a communist like 80 per cent of his
peers - a people's deputy in Russia's almost-democratic parliament in March
1990.
But then Yeltsin himself occupied numerous powerful party positions before
setting out on his own political trajectory. Indeed, for more than a year
Yeltsin and Khasbulatov were comrades in arms. They served together as
parliament speaker and deputy speaker respectively from May 1990. They both
pushed the cause of economic reform as Gorbachev's central government
vacillated with its 500-day plan and then drifted to the right. Most
important, after Yeltsin had been elected Russian president and Khasbulatov
had taken over as speaker, they both manned the barricades and drafted the
decrees at Moscow's White House during the August 1991 coup - a lively if
somewhat sketchy account of which forms the central section of this volume.
Such close collaboration between the two men in the past makes their more
recent falling-out seem especially bitter. Khasbulatov does not dwell on the
personal aspect of their current struggle, but some of his asides betray
pique at the fact that the solidarity they displayed during the coup did not
long survive it. 'Unfortunately, we placed too much faith immediately after
the suppression of the coup on the president and his team,' he writes
ruefully. Behind his animus towards those he calls Yeltsin's 'latter-day
courtiers', however, lies a multitude of real differences on subjects
ranging from the pace of economic reform to the structure of government and
the devolution of powers from the centre to Russia's regions.
Khasbulatov, a lawyer and economics professor, presents at least a plausible
diagnosis of Russia's problems. In the political as well as the economic
sphere, he argues, the collapse of the old system means the executive has
lost the capacity to govern. 'The pyramid of power controlled by the state
party was a terrible thing,' he writes without obvious nostalgia. 'But one
way or another it managed to govern. Having broken the hundred thousand or
so links of this mechanism's chain, from the Central Committee to the
district committee, from the factory to the collective farm, what did we put
in its place?'
For Khasbulatov, that question - what to put in its place - defines the
battle for Russia's future. Yeltsin's reformers want to break the chain
further, privatise faster, accelerate the disposal of state mono-liths to
the point where a restoration of central control becomes inconceivable. The
speaker would reply that this way chaos lies - the government cannot hope to
impose reform without the co-operation of Russia's real centres of economic
power such as state industry. That means seeking to involve the parliament,
which represents such interests, not bypassing it - and creating a system of
government with a proper separation and devolution of powers.
Is Russia to have reform by diktat or reform by consent? More to the point,
can either succeed while such fundamental political issues are in dispute?
The dilemmas have been too frequently oversimplified of late as western
governments have leapt unhesitatingly to Yeltsin's side. Khasbulatov's book
is a useful, and pretty depressing, counterblast.

FT  01 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Difficult to lock in low inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time UK inflation was low - in the mid-1980s - there was discussion
of how to 'lock in' that low rate, which obviously owed something to
temporary factors. The obvious suggestion then was to tie sterling to the
low-inflation D-Mark via the European exchange rate mechanism.
The indications, which I discussed in this column last week, of a possible
change in the long-range world economic climate from inflation to deflation
increase the need for the UK to try to lock itself in on this occasion. It
was none other than Harold MacMillan who warned of the follies of being 'an
island of inflation in a sea of deflation'.
What are the prospects? Both headline and underlying rates of UK inflation
fell last autumn and winter much further than generally realised. The annual
increase in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments, was 3.4
per cent in February - up 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the
January figure, but still lower than in any year since the 1960s. Non-food
producer prices rose only 2.7 per cent in the year to February.
The best anti-inflationary news is on the labour front. The annual rise in
earnings per head is now down to 4 3/4 per cent, compared with a minimum of
7 1/2 per cent in the 1980s. Meanwhile manufacturing productivity has been
increasing at 5 1/2 to 6 per cent a year - remarkably rapidly for the late
stages of a recession or the early stages of a recovery. Right-wing Tories,
who are the government's real opposition, only show their own innumeracy
when they say the gains of the Thatcher years have been either thrown away
or proved a snare and a delusion.
In any case the combination of wage moderation and productivity rise has led
to a slight fall in manufacturing unit wage costs. It is this measure which
has some claim to be the best one of the domestically generated core rate of
inflation.
The present phase, however, owes a lot to exceptional circumstances: namely
the pressure on British costs imposed by two years in the ERM at a
'challenging' exchange rate, combined with a severe domestic recession.
Since last autumn's 15 per cent effective devaluation of sterling, prices
connected with imports have been rising. Materials and fuels purchased by
manufacturing industry have risen by 7 per cent in a mere six months on a
seasonally adjusted basis. The devaluation occurred at the best possible
time in the cycle, when market forces were restraining the extent of
pass-through. But there is no way a depreciation of this size can fail to
affect recorded inflation.
Thus inflation indices have climbed back a little above their recent low
point; and the Treasury expects RPI inflation, excluding mortgage interest
rates, to bounce back to 3 3/4 per cent by the end of the year, while the
chancellor's independent experts expect 4 per cent.
The government naturally hopes the bounce-back will be temporary and the
devaluation effects 'once for all', passing away like clouds over a summer
landscape. This would allow inflation to settle down towards the bottom end
of the chancellor's 1 to 4 per cent target range.
What do the financial markets expect? Fortunately the existence of
index-linked gilt-edged securities gives some insight into the inflationary
expectations. Take a 10-year gilt-edged security with a gross redemption
yield of about 7.8 per cent a year. Then subtract from it the yield on an
indexed gilt of comparable maturity of 3.4 per cent. The difference is an
approximation to the expected average annual inflation rate over the next
year which comes out at about 4.4 per cent. This dodges the influence of
tax. But, as Maurice Scott argues in the February National Institute Review,
it is likely that tax-exempt pension funds and charities dominate the
index-linked market.
The details of how we reached the current position are interesting. During
previous periods of comparatively low inflationary expectations, normal
gilt-edged yields have come down. This pattern has been paralleled on the
present occasion by an only slightly smaller fall in the yield on indexed
gilts themselves.
Indexed-linked securities are a rarity outside the UK. But the fall in
yields on ordinary nominal British government securities has been echoed in
so many other countries in such different circumstances, that it is
difficult to believe that the driving force is only inflationary
expectations. There has probably been a drop in real interest rates in the
main industrial countries of about a percentage point to, say, 3 1/2 per
cent. You can ascribe this to the prolongation of the world recession. Or
you can say that the expected 'world shortage of capital' has failed to
materialise, as the needs for investment of the former communist countries
and others have not been accompanied by an effective demand for funds on
terms attractive to western investors.
The UK departure from the ERM did worsen expectations of future UK
short-term nominal interest rates. The chart of expected one-year interest
rates, derived by the Bank of England from the structure of gilt-edged
yields, rose in one week last September by more than one percentage point.
Since then, expected rates for a couple of years ahead have fallen
drastically in line with actual experience. But several years out they have
not recovered from Black Wednesday.
The other small chart shows that for a couple of years ahead there is little
difference between expected one-year interest rates in the UK and Germany.
But as one looks further ahead, expected UK interest rates climb back to
nearly 10 per cent, some 2 percentage points higher than anything expected
in Germany.
Financial markets are not predicting inflationary catastrophes. But they
know that governments are tempted to expand the economy too far as an
election approaches and thus sacrifice hard won inflationary gains.
The textbook remedy is that a government should tie its own hands,
'pre-commit itself', or something of that kind. There are only a limited
number of ways in which this can be done.
One example would have been a fixed-rate regime such as the ERM, which the
government could not abandon without losing a lot of political face. Another
would be to distance itself by means of an independent Bank of England.
Unfortunately credibility has been so badly damaged by the manner of
Britain's exit from the ERM that simply to rejoin it at some future time
would not be sufficient to rebuild credibility.
The Bank of England has made too much of Chancellor Norman Lamont's
published statement to the new governor, Eddie George, on his appointment
that 'his central responsibility should be to support the government in our
determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation,
the only sound basis on which sustainable growth and secure jobs can be
built'. This statement still leaves the government with the last word.
Indeed to rebuild credibility now requires belt, braces and suspenders. This
means a genuinely independent Bank of England and the return to a European
monetary arrangement as soon as conditions permit. Both would be achieved
together if the British government would co-operate with the new French
government in an attempt to make a real go of European monetary union. I
know the political obstacles and John Major and the Conservative whips could
name them all one by one.

FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: A better way for the UK government to borrow money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS DALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article, 'Gilts galore' (March 30), with its description
of the vagaries of short and long-dated issues, makes me think once more of
the vast waste of effort for highly intelligent people in the City of London
who spend their time guessing and second guessing one another as to the
levels of inflation over the coming years.
Why doesn't the government raise its money in the form of indexed linked
gilts and cut out all this nonsense?
I know that the Treasury loves to rob the investors by borrowing money and
then paying it back in trash 20 years later, but since we are the real
borrowers and we are the real victims, are we not kidding ourselves?
Might it not be cheaper for us to borrow real money and pay back real money
and tell the yuppies to do some useful work instead?
We could then borrow at about 3 per cent real instead of 4 to 6 per cent,
and save the premium we pay for unnecessary risk.

Sir, Concluding his article, 'The lion sleeps tonight' (March 26), Joe
Rogaly assets, gratuitously, that the government is 'running down an
industry that, on environmental grounds, should be written off by the turn
of the century'.
This completely overlooks the existence of the technology to burn coal much
more efficiently to produce electricity, with significantly reduced
environmental damage.
Practical implementation of this was blocked during the 1980s by the
government's refusal to authorise the very modest finance for 'lean burn'.

FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Bureaucratic 'shilly-shallying' on jobs scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL GAILER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sadly, just when the government seems to be coming out of a very
troubled period, there is evidence that some departments, at least, are
committed to a policy of determined vacillation.
How else can one explain the handling by the Department of Employment of the
benefits transfer programme proposed by Prof Dennis Snower (Personal View,
February 23) of Birkbeck College. While appearing to accept in principle
that it should be possible and permissible, in defined circumstances, for
some unemployed people to transfer their benefit to an employer in exchange
for a job, the Department of Employment, it appears, wants to run just four
small-scale pilot schemes, and to restrict very greatly the amount of
benefit transferable.
This is a classic example of bureaucratic shilly-shallying designed to kill
stone-dead a scheme which comes from outside the Civil Service.
The benefits transfer programme could, if adopted countrywide and
wholeheartedly, greatly reduce unemployment, according to Professor Snower's
calculations. Even if he is wrong what does the Department of Employment
have to lose by trying to make work a programme which attempts to do
something about unemployment. The benefits transfer programme does not
involve extra cost to government; in fact, it really cuts the cost of
benefits. It is not inflationary and gets people back to work so that they
start to pay income tax, National Insurance contributions, more VAT - so
what can possibly be wrong with that?
Why does not the employment secretary just get on with it instead of
fiddling about?

FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Chums' and Fans' 'Precious' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing that needs to be said about Precious, which occupies The
Place for the next ten days, is that it should carry a health warning. The
accompaniment to this latest show by the Cholmondeleys and the
Featherstonehaughs is provided by the optimistically titled Victims of Death
(ah] if only . . . ), and it is a brutish din performed live and fearsomely
loud under its creator, Steve Blake. Medical research in Sweden has shown
that when noise reaches levels of discomfort to the ear, then permanent
damage may ensue. The management of The Place would be well advised to
reduce the racket, which is alarming and acutely unpleasant. My own ringing
headache at the end of a tasteless and fatuous evening I attribute in part
to this mindless thumping - 80 minutes without an interval - and in part to
the grinding banality of the performance.
These sibling troupes (the Chums all female; the Fans all male) are directed
by Lea Anderson. Publicity puffs speak of Miss Anderson's 'wit', her power
to be 'humanly observant' and 'poised and bright with finesse'. What Miss
Anderson shows me is a movement language that smacks of some worthy
university dance department where being 'different' is more important than
either technique or range of experience. She has an ability to make small
absurdist comments through gesture, with a reliance upon repetition as a
choreographic tool; and an inability to sustain an idea on anything but the
shortest breath. Her pieces are examples of the direst 'Yoof Culcher' in
their cheap-jack means and minimally convincing dance. Her performers look
physically uninteresting, and propose a dead-pan manner that accords well
with the undistinguished things they are called upon to show us.
Precious falls into four parts, and pretends to be about alchemy. The cast
move from wearing unisex black outfits (Viva grunge) by way of evening dress
(white for the men; red for the women) to gold kaftans. The activity on view
I found less entertaining than watching a dripping tap. The only alchemy on
view is Miss Anderson's talent for turning dross into more dross, whatever
the costuming may proclaim.
I note that this enterprise boasts Arts Council funding, GLA Funding, and
support from Digital. Heads should roll. Any prospective viewer is advised
to take ear-plugs.

FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Barstow's 'Fidelio' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest run of Fidelio performances at Covent Garden brings Josephine
Barstow to the title role. This immediately raises the production (first
seen in 1990, first revived last September) on to a higher plane of dramatic
vitality than it has so far reached. There are, however, still higher ones
yet to be attained. Though now shorn of those dreadful passages of
re-written dialogue inserted by the original producer, Adolf Dresen, the
staging remains limp and lacklustre - purposelessly fussy in domestic
scenes, hovering on the edge of comical ineptitude in the finale.
And withal Miss Barstow, taut in bearing, intent in every glance and
gesture, anchors the opera in dramatic credibility in spite of every passing
threat thereto. On the most basic level, as Tuesday's performance showed,
she remains physically the most credible of boy-girls - tall, coltish, made
scrawny by desperation and determination. Beyond this, she carries within
her that essential set-apart-ness which not only proves attractive to
Marzelline and plausible to Rocco but chimes with the character's effect on
Beethoven's musical development of the opera.
There are, I know, those pitiable souls unresponsive to the controlled
magnetism of the Barstow stage presence, alienated by the intense,
complicated quality of vocal timbre and not compensated by the fiery
musicianship that underlies it. This singer has always struggled with
Leonore's music (but few indeed are those who have not]), yet it seems to me
that she now deals with it far more fluently than in those Glyndebourne and
ENO Fidelios more than a decade ago.
To the doubters I would simply reply by first affirming that this is of
course not the gloriously outpouring Heldensopran Leonore of legend; and by
then insisting that it is an achievement all the more remarkable, more
meaningful, for that.
Other valuable elements abound in the revival: once they have come together
more cohesively, a Fidelio of real ensemble character is in prospect. The
young couple, Gillian Webster and Lynton Atkinson, are appealing; there is
an absolutely first-rate Rocco - robust, bluff, calculating and craven all
at one go - from the Austrian bass Kurt Rydl (house debut), whose only
misjudgment is an excess of loud singing.
Reiner Goldberg's Florestan, substituted at short notice for Josef
Protschka's, is reedy, edgy, affecting. While Willard White, warm-toned and
innately noble in stage personality, may not seem obvious casting for
Pizarro, his performance certainly registers. Jeffrey Tate conducts - not
always precisely, but with energy (apart from a couple of slack tempos in
Act 2), dramatic sensitivity, a winning altertness to the specific musical
workings of every page and passage.

Artists are funny people. Put a pen or brush in their hands and they either
bend to their task with monkish devotion (painter Antonio Lopez in Victor
Erice's The Quince Tree Sun) or throw tantrums, empty whisky bottles and
impregnate their secretaries (composer Max Von Sydow in Krzysztof Zanussi's
The Silent Touch).
Of the two options, neither guarantees a good time for the spectator. But of
the two films both have major curiosity value. Erice's is a Spanish TV
documentary that sprouted wings and became a Cannes prize-winning feature.
And Zanussi's is a Euro-pudding that plunges earthward only after some
fiery, spirit-soaked mumming from Von Sydow.
The star of The Quince Tree Sun is the quince tree. Standing in the dusty
backyard of Senor Lopez, a real Madrid artist, it beckons his paintbrush.
For 2 1/4 hours we watch him fail to complete the canvas that is his main
work one wet autumn. Though rain stops paint, it does not deter the film's
sense of near-religious eventlessness. Lopez lives on bread, air and the odd
glass of Spanish plonk. In and out of his life wander a dog, a wife, two
daughters, a painter friend and a Chinese visitor. And there are shots of
nearby apartment-block windows, of a rail-line, of Mrs Lopez pottering or
herself painting. She is working on a picture of Mr Lopez prone on a bed,
his sole recreation away from the quince tree.
The film is fascinating: but not for the reason its admirers proclaim. They
see an affirmative fable of spiritual and artistic struggle as the
film-maker watches the painter work out his subject. Lopez suspends
plumblines and paints white check-marks on the leaves to ensure the
consistency of the image in face of the capriciousness of Nature.
But I am not in the uplifting masterpiece camp. The film fascinates because
it embodies the struggle it depicts: it has Nothing To Say and yet says it
with a crazed, anomic majesty. Erice is no stranger to minimalism. But where
his first film The Spirit Of The Beehive was about the mysteries of growing
up in a world of opaque and sinister mysticism - it had a sense of progress,
however pained and slow - The Quince Tree Sun is a cinematic cul-de-sac
pretending to be a through-road. An absurd artistic task - who needs
mathematical pictures of fruit trees? - is absurdly apotheosised, right up
to its absurd quietus. The occasional spurt of beauty or serendipitous
insight makes the experience more poignant, more tantalising. For
inspiration under siege is both the subject of The Quince Tree Sun and the
style of its making.
It is also the reason we are drawn to Max Von Sydow's crusty Danish composer
in The Silent Touch. Wrestling with an uncompliant muse, the only notes
Sydow has composed in 40 years are to the milkman. Now he lives in a country
mansion with wife Sarah Miles. He is a moody mage wrapped in winter rugs
until Polish student Lothaire Bluteau (Jesus of Montreal) bursts into their
peace. Bluteau can water-divine; he can heal by the 'silent touch' of hands;
and he can re-animate, he claims, Von S's creative juices.
Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi has dealt before - and better - with the
self-destruct energies of the human mind and imagination. See Illumination
and Camouflage. For The Silent Touch, first fruit of a new European
Co-production Fund, his original story idea has been hijacked by two English
writers, Peter Morgan and Mark Wadlow. A tale that should fly through
strange high-altitude corridors known only to KZ is instead forced to make
for Banality Airport, where everybody speaks the same language
(Euro-English) and stars from different countries can gather in the VIP
lounge.
When not enacting the timeless drama of the Impossible Genius - Von Sydow
beds everything on two legs, including his nubile new secretary, and breaks
everything else - the film plods through its over-schemed, quasi-Faustian
transference-of-creativity scenario between student and genius.
The confrontations are stagey and the dialogue is by hot-air speech balloon.
Thank heaven then for Mad Max. The Swedish actor chews his role as if it
were the sourest Hesperidean apple. At times he spits out bits he does not
like; at others he fills his mouth with noises of pagan, guttural relish. If
we must have the art movie as Euro-bathos, let us at least have a Euro-star
making a meal of things at the centre.
*****
The giant moon that hovered over Moonstruck has been re-hired for Used
People. Its presence indicates that rooftop yearnings from New York's ethnic
community will loom large and so will bitter-sweet melancholy. 'Life's
tough, so laugh a little' insists the moon-bathed poster. So we do: at this
likable, oldfashioned, sentimental - let us face it, creaky - comedy about
second-chancers.
Second-chancers are mature people who, cheated by life to date, suddenly
turn around and order life to pay recompense. Thus Shirley MacLaine, a
sixtyish Jewish widow from Queens who has spent too long washing dishes and
raising children, accepts it when Marcello Mastroianni, an Italian roue
dressed in 1930s-era 'Anyone for Venice' clothes, kindles the first spark of
romance at her husband's funeral party.
Self-liberation soon spreads virus-like through the family. Homebound
grandma Jessica Tandy just might buzz off to Florida with best friend Sylvia
Sidney. And MacLaine's daughters, frumpish Kathy Bates and neurotic beauty
Marcia Gay Harden (her young son already a psychiatric couch-case), just
might make a respective dash for glamour and responsible motherhood.
Todd Graff's screenplay spreads in all directions like an overturned syrup
tin. But British director Beeban Kidron (of TV's Oranges Are Not The Only
Fruit) moves essential household objects into position - spaghetti pans,
double-beds, televisions broadcasting the first moon landing - to corral the
schmaltz. A wry, gawky domestic everydayness stands guard over the
escape-prone whimsy. So does a first-class cast. Invidious to pick out one
member, so I will. Shirley MacLaine: for crackerjack acting and for having
the nerve to look 60, at least until her wedding day when the make-up men
hitch up her cheeks and cameraman David Watkin puts about 28 gauzes (my
count) between her and the softly focused camera.
In Night Of The Living Dead no one gets the soft-focus treatment. Worse, a
professional make-up man has escaped and is running amok across the country.
George Romero's 1968 zombie classic is here remade in colour by Tom Savini,
cosmetician on the earlier film.
Savini shreds our nerves with a razor-sharp replay of Romero's opening
scene: the graveyard ghouls lumbering forth in broad daylight to terrify the
heroine and KO her brother. Then the film battles bravely against dwindling
returns, as we movie into the all-colour bloodbath in the zombie-besieged
farmhouse. Savini's hopping camera and Romero's own no-nonsense script
ensure few lulls in energy. But menace is a more elusive matter. The
black-and-white original - perhaps by being black and white - had menace
galore.
Splitting Heirs and Mr Nanny fight it out for the Week's Worst Comedy award.
Before we open the envelope, let us have a sample scene from each. Here in
Splitting Heirs, directed by Robert Young, we see writer-star Eric Idle drop
his trousers, fall over, bump into John Cleese, disappear down Barbara
Hershey's cleavage and discover he is a British aristocrat not an
Anglo-Indian Hindu investment broker. (Short pause for polite laughter). And
in our scene from Mr Nanny, directed by Michael Gottlieb, wrestler-star Hulk
Hogan dons a tutu, biffs a visiting party of gangsters, saves the children
he is bodyguarding, rips off Home Alone and falls into a pond. (Same).
And the winner is . . .

FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Behrens and the LPO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was really Hildegard Behrens' concert at the Royal Festival Hall on
Tuesday - the London Philharmonic was there too, but only to accompany her
in Wagner and Strauss, and to supply a prelude. The latter was Mahler's full
string-band version (1894) of Schubert's 'Death and the Maiden' Quartet.
This curiosity, reconstructed from Mahler's annotations on a printed quartet
score, has become unaccountably popular among conductors.
None of them manages to make massed violins sound remotely plausible in the
high, flickering descants of the Allegro. That was the sort of thing Mahler
would soon be writing for first-violin sections in his own symphonies, but
in Schubert it sounds grotesque. Here, the brave collective effort sometimes
swallowed up the main tunes on lower strings, as a solo leader could never
do. The conductor Franz Welser-Most ensured that all of it was at least
'interesting', with enough dynamic hairpins to supply an Expressionist
hairdresser for several weeks.
In the great Tristan und Isolde Prelude he achieved smoothness and musical
efficiency, nothing much like erotic anguish or desperate surges (loud, yes;
desperate, no). Then Miss Behrens took up the 'Liebestod', initially in
tremulous or perhaps just curdled tones: hard to be sure which] Concluding a
strenuous performance of the whole opera, the effect might seize one's
heart; but Isolde must soar at last in the 'Liebestod' - and Miss Behrens
did not, because the voice exerted no rhythmic grip of its own. Soaring
needs a firm springboard. 'Mild und leise' to a fault, the Behrens soprano
floated loosely, with too many consonants disappearing altogether over
Welser-Most's fluent accompaniment.
The special virtue, or confluence of virtues, that has justified Miss
Behrens' career is that her fine, unshowy intelligence complements a voice
which is soft-grained, and yet large and penetrating enough to compete in
heroic roles with steelier sopranos. In the Salome peroration she was
grandly audible throughout the orchestral eruptions, but also palpably
feminine and vulnerable - no ferocious Brunnhilde overtones, such as turn
many an operatic Salome into an obsessed monster. (That is meant as a
musico-biological observation, not a 'sexist' remark.) Behrens conveyed a
lethal passion with impassioned innocence.

With television, more even than most areas of life, nothing succeeds like
success: appear on one chat show and you will promptly be invited on to
others; star in a successful series and you will be wooed by every breakfast
programme and game show on every channel. Flavour of the year so far has
been Richard Wilson who plays the misanthropic Victor Meldrew in 'One Foot
In The Grave'. Today BBC2 shows Richard Wilson: A Life Beyond The Grave
(8.00) in which he travels back to his home town of Greenock and colleagues
assess his talents. The current run of Minder, not the best ever but not the
worst, either, ends with Arthur and Ray in Australia trying to raise the
readies to get back to London (8.30 ITV). French &amp; Saunders ends with a
parody of 'Thelma and Louise' (9.00 BBC2) and the archive series A Labour Of
Love, about child care in Britain between 1900 and 1950, finishes with a
look at nannies and foster mothers (9.30 BBC2). BBC1's series on
miscarriages of justice, Rough Justice, investigates the case of Patrick
Kane who was given a life sentence after two British soldiers were stripped
and shot by the IRA (9.30).

FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: City of Angels - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one fault in City of Angels: the first act is about 10-15 minutes
too long. For the rest, however, here must be the wittiest musical that has
ever been written.
The wit runs all the way through: in Cy Coleman's music (largely jazz); in
the lyrics by David Zippel; in the sets and the pace of the scene-changing
designed by Robin Wagner; in some remarkable acting performances, especially
by Martin Smith; and, above all, in the script by Larry Gelbart. The overall
direction by Michael Blakemore almost never misses a trick.
Although it is set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, Angels succeeds without
resort to nostalgia, sentimentality or repetition. It is just sheer
brilliant fun. Indeed there is one scene towards the end that made me think
that the principal influence is not the Hollywood greats, but Pirandello.
For Angels is about illusions and reality.
There are other influences, of course. Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is
among them. The piece is full of one-liners that could have come straight
from Chandler's pages. As we look at the distinctly striking blonde, Mrs
Kingsley, the comment is: 'Only the floor kept her legs from going on for
ever.' When she offers the detective Dollars 10,000, he calculates; 'Next to
Mrs Kingsley, that was the best figure in the room.' All of that is played
very fast and not allowed to get in the way of other treasures.
Some of the one-liners range wider. 'Everybody's in a movie,' says the
Hollywood producer (Henry Goodman), 'sometimes we just turn the cameras on.'
Goodman has earlier come out with the line that must be an editor's delight:
'Nothing any good was ever hurt by cutting.'
The plot may be confusing. Basically, a script-writer is complaining that
his best work keeps being not only changed, but hacked to pieces. At the
same time, his text about money, sex and murder is being played out in real
life. It is not always clear where real life ends and fantasy begins. Again,
that is part of the charm and the relentless pace. It does not matter if you
cannot keep up.
The lyrics are cerebral, specialising in clever off-rhymes: 'It would be
wiser/ If I kept my eyes off/ Her thighs', 'If you're not celibate, Let's
make the hell of it.' Occasionally Zippel over-reaches himself, but I still
admire the ambition of: 'Your fertile lies/ Don't fertilise'. Just as in the
script there is a wonderful line from an old 1940s radio disc jockey: 'Just
listen to this melody - you'll think your ears are getting laid.' There is
no nostalgia here, but there is some gentle satire.
The music is good, too, and compels attention, for it seldom repeats itself.
'With Every Breath I Take,' sung by Fiona Hendley as Bobbi, is breathtaking.
It has one reprise, but no-one could complain that anything in this show is
milked.
In the acting, the summa cum laude goes to Martin Smith as the
script-writer, Stine. This is the equivalent of the straight male lead:
handsome, but dull. You would expect him to be overshadowed by the
detective, Stone (Roger Allam), yet one of the pleasures is how he grows in
his part and Stine and Stone come together. Sometimes Smith just stands
there: on a large stage in a large theatre it takes a lot of self-confidence
to do that.
Angels, in short, is a hugely ambitious piece that reaches for the top and
makes it. You may see now why I gave less than alpha to Kiss of the
Spiderwoman, Carousel and Crazy for You.

FT  01 APR 93 / Technology: Patents pack a costly punch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To patent or not to patent? Inventors have asked themselves this question
down the centuries. The earliest known patent of invention in England
granted by Henry VI in 1449 gave John of Utynam a 20-year monopoly for a new
method of making stained glass.
Today's UK Patent Office, which also grants 20-year patents, was set up in
1883 and receives nearly 30,000 patent applications a year. As it points
out, however, the existence of a patent is no indication that an invention
has any merit or chance of selling. 'In fact, it may be easier to obtain a
patent than to gain any commercial success for the invention it protects.'
For most inventors, a patent will probably be the most positive result from
all their efforts, since the success rate for inventions is very small. But
it is an essential step if the new product has more than one application and
can thus be licensed out to several companies for different uses.
Apart from wanting to know whether or not to take out a patent, the hopeful
inventor will also want to know the cost. Big companies, with their own
patent experts and lawyers, will have enough expertise and experience to
decide for themselves. But those working alone will need advice.
The services of a patent agent can cost around Pounds 2,000. The agent will
advise on the complex task of drawing up a description of the device or
process so all possible applications and modifications are included. In some
cases, especially where a process rather than a product is involved, it
might be better to keep the invention a secret and rely on confidentiality
agreements with partners to guard against copying.
'If you don't protect ideas, the chances are that the financial returns from
innovation will be pretty slim,' says Ted Blake, the Patent Office's
marketing services director. It costs Pounds 285 to obtain a patent - Pounds
25 for filing the initial application and Pounds 130 each for search and
examination to check that the idea is new and meets legal requirements.
Annual renewal from five years after filing costs Pounds 110.
While this may not seem high, the costs can mount steeply when patents are
taken out abroad. Since there is no such thing as a world patent, foreign
protection has to be obtained by individual country filings, through the
European Patent Convention (offering protection in 17 countries with a
single filing), or under the Patent Co-operation Treaty, covering 59
countries.
Mike Watson, the inventor of a cable coupling transformer which has been
licensed by two companies, has spent some Pounds 25,000 on UK and foreign
patents, including agents' fees. The different patents for James Dyson's
cyclone-technology vacuum cleaner have cost around Pounds 750,000, with
nearly Pounds 100,000 in annual renewal costs.
Time is also an important factor. 'For very fast-moving products, the patent
system is too ponderous,' says one patent agent. It may be better simply to
get the product on to the market before it is overtaken by consumer taste,
fashion, or the sheer speed of technological development.
A significant aspect of patents is their deterrent effect. 'The right to sue
someone (for infringement) can be a very valuable right in the commercial
world,' the agent adds. This is especially true in the highly litigious US,
where patents are often tested severely in court - either to browbeat
potential competitors or as a softening up process before negotiation.
Insurance can be taken out against lawsuits, but this tends to be costly.
Ian Harvey, chief executive of British Technology Group, stresses the
importance of policing patents. It obtained Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) in an
out-of-court settlement from the US government over the Pentagon's
infringement of patents for the Hovercraft. The case cost BTG more than
Pounds 1m to bring and was settled in less than five years; some US cases
can take as long as 20 years. When sizeable markets and revenues are at
stake, says Harvey, 'you have to have deep pockets and be seen to be willing
to defend your patents'.

FT  01 APR 93 / People: Smith leaves M&amp;S for Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the UK retailing group, yesterday became the latest company to
split the roles of chairman and chief executive, bringing in Alan Smith,
head of store operations at Marks and Spencer, as right-hand man to Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy.
The company says the rapid growth of its businesses - including its recent
Pounds 1bn acquisition of Darty, France's leading electrical retailer - and
the large volume of new project work that involved, meant that chairman and
chief executive Sir Geoff was 'stretched on too many fronts'. Nigel
Whittaker, corporate affairs director, says: 'I can't think of any other
company with a Pounds 4bn turnover where the responsibilities are split
between only three executive directors.'
Smith - who, according to Whittaker, 'has the right personality for
Kingfisher and a good strategic brain' - will run Kingfisher's day-to-day
retail operations, while Sir Geoff will oversee strategy, the relationship
with Darty, and the development of other international relationships.
Smith, 52, joined Marks and Spencer in 1964, and moved to head office in
1966 where he held executive and board appointments in the food and textile
divisions, and European operations. He became an M and S director in 1978.
He was responsible for the Business Development Group set up in January
1987, which led to the purchase of Brooks Brothers and Kings Supermarkets in
the US in 1988. He was responsible for North America and Far East operations
from 1988 to 1990, and then for the food division until 1992.
Whittaker refused to comment on rumours circulating yesterday that Smith's
salary package would be more than Pounds 1m, saying only that he would
receive 'a sensible salary reflecting market rates, together with an
incentive bonus'.

Keith Earthrowl, a former board member of English &amp; American Group, which
has just withdrawn from the London Market and appointed a provisional
liquidator for a portion of its activities, might have thought he had got
out in time when the IT and computer systems subsidiary he ran, Tower Hill
Services, was purchased by Sherwood Computer Services. He joined the
Sherwood board last month on completion of the acquisition - only to hand in
his resignation four weeks later.
Charles Taylor, finance director of Sherwood, explains: 'The courtship stage
is always quite attractive for an individual, but unfortunately when we got
down to business, it did not work out. We have a very flat and interactive
management structure, whereas he was used to a classically hierarchical
set-up. We discussed ways of making it work, but soon agreed it would not.'
Earthrowl had been a longstanding client of Sherwood before English &amp;
American decided to set up their own systems in-house. 'A client/provider
relationship is quite different from working with someone as a colleague,'
says Taylor.
Twenty five years in the insurance business, Earthrowl had been in the
underwriting management division of CT Bowring/Marsh McLennan before joining
English &amp; American Group in 1983.

FT  01 APR 93 / Technology: The elusive road to success - Andrew Fisher
continues a series on innovation by examining the complex process of
marketing an idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIKE Watson's eyes light up when he recalls the thrill of 'the Eureka
moment' that changed his life three years ago. It was then the idea for a
device to send or receive information through any section of a twin-core
cable came to him. 'It's a wonderful feeling when you realise that you've
come up with something that's the first in the world.'
But elation can soon turn into doubt and anxiety. Bringing an invention
successfully to market is often a monumental task and success is elusive.
Patents have to be obtained, prototypes made, legal agreements concluded and
business persuaded to take an interest. 'In human terms you're very, very
alone. It can be very depressing,' says Watson.
Today, Watson is starting to earn money from his invention, having licensed
it to two companies. Called the Watsonlinc cable coupling transformer, its
potential applications cover telecommunications, computers, communication in
difficult areas such as in tunnels, and medicine and science.
Along the way, he has been helped by Britain's Design Council, which runs
the Innovation NoticeBoard to put industry in touch with new ideas, as well
as by helpful patent and licence agents, and the London Enterprise Agency.
He has also won innovation awards. Yet the process has taken plenty of
money, as well as effort and frustration. So far, he reckons the cost has
been around Pounds 100,000 - mainly on patent and development expenses, but
also in lost income.
Jeffrey Woolf has also had to dip deep into his pockets, and those of
friends and family. His pursuit of the hoped-for commercial breakthrough has
cost some Pounds 70,000. Woolf is not so far down the road to commercial
success as Watson, despite having also won innovation awards for his
micromap - a miniaturised map with a portable magnifier. The idea came to
him while watching skiers struggle to find their way in a snowstorm on the
French slopes early in 1991, their maps flapping uselessly in the wind. He
is now talking to groups of potential investors interested in some of
micromap's sporting, technical, and consumer applications.
In common with countless other inventors, both men's lives have been
dominated by the ideas born from their flashes of inspiration.
John Endacott, who has invented a new type of separation vessel to separate
oil from water on floating production platforms, has found his enthusiasm
dented by the struggle to gain commercial recognition.
'As an engineer,' he says of his own experience, 'you've suddenly got to
become a patent expert, understand licence agreements and contracts and do
your own marketing.' He now has licences with two process engineering
companies.
Like Watson, he took out a second mortgage on his home to help finance his
idea. 'There's a lot of strain on finances, health and family,' adds
Endacott. He turned for help to Inventalink, an invention sales company
which seeks to match new products with partners for licensing deals.
Inventalink helped Endacott with commercial negotiations, using its
experience to gain access to executives. Although organisations like
Inventalink, which take a share of income in return for their efforts,
cannot guarantee success - some brokers are keener on taking inventors'
money than helping them, say innovation experts - they are one source of
guidance.
'There's clearly a desperate need for private inventors to have a platform
from which to launch new ideas at any stage of development,' says Charles
Dawes, Inventalink's managing director. 'The British inventor needs help,
needs a more helpful bank manager with more courage and needs firms to take
up the idea and re-license it round the world.'
Encouragingly, Inventalink has experienced a pick-up of activity in recent
months, suggesting the long-awaited ending of the recession could lead to
greater opportunities for inventors and innovators. Tudor Webasto, a
German-owned manufacturer of car sunroofs, is using its services to find new
vehicle safety products to help future growth.
'It would be regrettable if we didn't explore new ideas,' says Alan Garnett,
Tudor's chief executive. He points out that the slim profit margins British
manufacturers have had to accept in recent years means many do not have the
financial capacity to explore a number of ideas. 'So there is a need to be
ultra-selective.'
For UK inventors seeking partners to take up their ideas, the Design
Council, funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, is an obvious port
of call. Its Innovation NoticeBoard is free, but highly selective in the
products it includes. Susan Cottam, manager of the scheme, says individuals
are probably best advised to find companies to license their products and
thus start earning royalties, rather than try to raise funds for their own
manufacture.
'We try to find out what's happening in the market and keep in contact with
enterprise agencies and TECs (Training and Enterprise Councils),' she says.
'There is a pillar-to-post effect, since the various organisations are not
very well networked.' The government is trying to help and plans to set up
15 pilot One Stop Shops to advise small firms. It also has schemes to
finance technological innovations, but their scope is limited.
Some people prefer to go it alone. James Dyson, who has moved from designing
to inventing and manufacturing, is sceptical of the value of licensing and
also of the level of official help offered to promote new ideas and
products. His latest product is the Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner that has
just gone on sale in the UK. 'If anyone asked me, I would say 'go and make
it yourself, as it's quicker and cheaper'. It depends, of course, on the
product and market area.'
The first, expensive, version of the vacuum cleaner, which uses high-speed
cyclone technology, is made by Silver Reed, the Japanese typewriter company,
and sold only in Japan. His newer, far less expensive model, is made by his
own company in the UK. He finds the attitude of much of British industry to
innovation depressing. 'Companies tend to be run by accountants, salesmen
and lawyers. They don't value engineers or products.' In the US and Japan,
however, he says there is a large commitment to research. 'It's a real
eye-opener working with a Japanese company. Their attitude is extraordinary.
They're not in it for a quick buck.'
British companies, he feels, are often bad at taking up and commercialising
ideas. They also fear failure, though mistakes are inevitable with
innovation. Illustrating the problems new products can encounter in the UK,
Dyson says it was hard to buy British parts for the Dual Cyclone: the motor
is Italian, the switch and accessory tools German, the ball bearings
Chinese, the flex French and the plastic comes from the Netherlands.
Also concerned about the UK's slowness in bringing new ideas to market is
Paul Ambridge, chairman of the Institute of Patentees and Inventors. 'The UK
as a nation is extraordinary inventive. However, what we are poor at is
using our capabilities to produce products.' Adds Ambridge, who is also a
Design Council official: 'We don't necessarily have either the people or the
organisations that can take an invention and make it into an innovation.'
Hilary Trudeau, who manages Support for Innovation as a national service for
companies to screen new ideas, believes that lack of funding is one of
Britain's biggest problems. Banks often shy away from lending to
technology-oriented ventures, though National Westminster has a
trailbreaking Technology Unit. So attention has turned to the encouragement
of 'business angels', the US-derived definition for successful entrepreneurs
willing to help new firms, as a way of filling this financial gap.
Yet angels are not always easy to find. Some corporations have funded awards
to help budding innovators, but recessionary cost-cutting has taken its toll
of these. Trudeau, who was involved with the NatWest/BP awards, is trying to
raise money for another corporate prize scheme to assist people with
commercially viable ideas. 'There is a yawning need for this,' she says.
Inventors desperate for funds to keep their ideas and products alive long
enough to reach the marketplace are bound to agree.
The series concludes next week with a look at innovation in industry

Johnson Group Cleaners, the biggest dry cleaners in the UK and the US, has
added a Johnson to its list of non-executive directors. However, Peter
Johnson (above), 60, is not a member of one of the firm's founding families,
but the retiring chairman of Unilever's Brooke Bond Foods business.
Johnson, who was found through a firm of headhunters, is filling a board
vacancy that has existed since the death of Arthur Winspear. Peter Johnson
started his career as a young grocery salesman with Oxo in the 1950s and was
managing director of Brooke Bond Oxo when it was acquired by Unilever in
1984. He retires from Brooke Bond Foods at the end of the month and has
already been appointed a non-executive director of Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the
wholesale cash and carry firm.

Argyll, the UK retailing group, has appointed two non-exec-utive directors
following the retirement from the board of Sir Cranley Onslow MP, a former
chairman of the 1922 committee, and a non-executive director since 1983.
The appointments increase non-executive representation on the board from
four to five.
Ann Burdus (above left), 49, joins the board from today, and will join
Argyll's audit and remuneration committees. A well-known personality in the
advertising world, she joined Ogilvy, Benson &amp; Mather in 1961, before moving
to McCann &amp; Co where she rose to be chairman 1979-81. She is a former
chairman of the Advertising Association, and is a member of the Top Salaries
Review Board. She is also a director of Dawson International.
Neville Bain (right), 52, chief executive of Coats Viyella, joins on May 1.
Before joining Coats in 1989 he worked for 29 years in the food industry
with Cadbury Schweppes, where he was latterly finance director and deputy
chief executive. He will chair Argyll's audit committee, and join the
remuneration committee.

FT  01 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Caring for key
clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much emphasis should companies place on managing their key customers?
The question was tackled - if not necessarily resolved - this week at a
seminar organised by the Sundridge Park corporate and executive development
centre in Kent.
Top of the agenda were results from what Sundridge Park believes is the
first reliable UK survey of Account Management (shorthand for the art of
paying particular attention to, and developing a long-term relationship
with, specific customers). Based on the responses from 300 manufacturing and
service businesses, the survey demonstrates that practice for the moment
varies widely: in 18-19 per cent of companies polled, for example, more than
four fifths of total turnover is handled by account managers, but in nearly
25 per cent of cases the figure drops to under a fifth of total sales.
Among the findings is evidence that too much may be expected of account
managers - on average individuals in half the companies looked after more
than six clients, which some experts think may be too much.
Training needs are also being neglected - 40 per cent of companies said
there had been no formal training for account managers in the last year. Nor
are the rewards exactly handsome. Two thirds of respondent companies were
paying under Pounds 30,000 (including commissions and bonus) per manager,
and 16 per cent less than Pounds 20,000.
More encouragingly, there are signs that companies have been able to
integrate account management across product areas and different territories
The most important test, of course, is the bottom line. Sundridge detects a
tentative link between 'defensive' or 'responsive' sales strategies and
lower sales growth. But more research is needed to establish a clearer
relationship between offensive strategies such as account management and
better performance.

FT  01 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Selling on the sofa
 -Americans are hooked on television shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the minds of most Americans, shopping by television still conjures up
images of tacky kitchen gadgets being hawked by an invisible announcer. The
announcer (always a man) barked out the wonders of Veg-O-Matics, a vegetable
slicer, and a toll-free number to call for orders.
But television shopping, once a joke, appears to be on the threshold of
becoming big business. Now, instead of the crude commercials on late night
TV a decade ago, whole channels - on cable - are devoted to it seven days a
week, 24 hours a day. Increasingly it is becoming a legitimate way to market
a variety of better-quality goods, including relatively high-priced
jewellery, fashions and computers.
The industry's two dominant companies, QVC (standing for Quality, Value and
Convenience) based in West Chester, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb, and
Home Shopping Network, based in St Petersburg Florida, had combined revenues
of more than Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.49bn) in 1992, an increase of 76 per
cent from the Dollars 1.2bn of 1989.
HSN, the 11-year-old pioneer in the industry, reaches some 60m homes, while
six-year-old QVC, reaches 47m.
The selling approach and the target markets of the two networks differ
considerably. QVC, as one Wall Street analyst put it, 'is your friend in the
livingroom,' using a soft sell for higher spending consumers. Whereas, HSN
uses more high-pressure tactics - 'Your time's running out' - and aims at
the market's more moderate and lower end.
The popular conception of TV shopping's audience consists of retirees,
housewives, insomniacs and assorted social misfits without much of a life.
However, Craig Bibb, an analyst with PaineWebber who follows the industry,
said he was surprised to learn that Wall Street portfolio managers and other
investment professionals watch QVC and make purchases. 'They say it's good
value,' he observes.
A recent Deloitte &amp; Touche study showed that overall the TV shopper is not
markedly different from the average US consumer. The average household
income of a TV shopper is Dollars 34,900, compared with the Dollars 38,000
for the market average. But while there are more TV shoppers earning less
than Dollars 30,000 a year, the reach into the upper echelons of the
consumers is about the same. While 9 per cent of the market average earn
over Dollars 75,000, 8 per cent of TV shoppers do too.
One notable difference - and a possible clue to the direction of TV shopping
 -is that 44 per cent of TV shoppers buy from catalogues, compared with just
12 per cent in the market average. It is widely speculated that TV shopping
could dent catalogue merchandising.
TV shopping succeeds in selling largely for two reasons, according to
Stephen Hoch, professor of marketing and behavioural science at the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. It uses amiable hosts
to make a personal connection with viewers which reduces their resistance to
persuasion. By putting the product in the consumer's living room, TV
shopping induces them to act impulsively.
And once it gets a customer, TV shopping tends to keep him or her. Peter
Siris, an analyst at UBS securities, says: 'They have generated a high
percentage of repeat buyers, perhaps the highest in any retail business.'
The rate of repeat buyers at QVC is nearing 60 per cent. Those repeat
customers also spend more per year, Dollars 502 compared with Dollars 52 for
one-time customers.
The companies make their profits from a mark-up of about 100 per cent, but
because they buy in bulk they can still undersell retail stores.
Television shopping's respectability recently received a sizeable fillip
with the entry of one of America's stars of entertainment programming, Barry
Diller, once chief of Paramount, the Hollywood studio, and most recently
chairman of Fox television, which he built into America's fourth largest
network.
Last December, Diller was persuaded to invest Dollars 25m in QVC and become
its chairman by John Malone, chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc
(TCI), the biggest US cable company, and Brian Roberts, president of
Comcast, the fourth-biggest cable company. TCI and Comcast had already
bought into QVC and were looking for a way to upgrade it.
Diller's programming genius is expected to lift television shopping to new
heights. One rumoured first move is that he will capitalise on the American
obsession with fitness and diet by dedicating a new channel (QVC already has
two) to selling health and food products. But Diller refused to confirm this
and said there was a long menu of thematic choices 'every one of which we're
looking at'.
Another indication of TV shopping's growing cachet was the announcement in
early March that Saks Fifth Avenue, the department store chain, had agreed
to become the first big retailer to market through QVC. And top names in
high fashion, including Diller's friend Calvin Klein, say they are willing
to consider selling on QVC, a notion that would have prompted a derisive
laugh a year ago.
How far TV shopping will go remains unclear as the industry is still in
flux. TCI, part owner of QVC, also controls, through its Liberty Media
subsidiary, HSN. A merger proposal between HSN and Liberty Media is on the
table and there is speculation about combining QVC and HSN.
Meanwhile, technological advances could boost the business over the next
several years. As the number of cable channels multiplies nearly tenfold,
many more are likely to be devoted to shopping. Television is also likely to
become more interactive, some day allowing shoppers to, for example, see
clothing in their own sizes.
In addition, the US industry, looking to expand, is casting its eye on
Europe, where - if the success of France Telecom's Minitel is any indication
 -the concept of electronic shopping seems viable.
Minitel attaches a small screen to a phone for database display of retail
offerings, including groceries.
Nonetheless, even in the US, most people still seem to prefer going to the
store and TV shopping hardly qualifies as a regular fixture of American
life. But, then, neither did telephone answering machines or VCRs a decade
ago.

FT  01 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The advertisers
strike back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Armed with high-technology advertisement 'zappers' such as mute buttons,
remote control channel switchers and fast-forward options, television
viewers are waging a successful battle to blot out the sight and sound of
television commercials these days.
'We no longer have a captive audience,' said Helen Johnston, a director of
media analysis at Grey Advertising in New York. 'People mute out the sound
when the commercials come on, leave the room, fast-forward through the
commercials on their VCR recording, or just switch to another channel when
an advertisement comes on the air.'
But advertisers have begun to fight back. One rule of thumb is to make sure
the commercial tells a comprehensible story, even if the viewer has turned
on the mute button or left the room. 'A person has to leave on either the
visual or the audio; otherwise how will they know when their programme comes
back on?' said Robert Warrens, a media research director at J Walter
Thompson.
Because of the mute button, written texts are becoming increasingly popular.
'We watch our commercials with the sound turned off to make sure the message
can get across that way,' said Andrew Bohjalian, a creative at Grey, whose
commercial on Dannon yoghurt features slogans such as 'Nutrient Dense'
floating in large print on the screen.
Although advertisers may find ways around the mute buttons, viewers who
shift aimlessly from channel to channel and those who record their
programmes only to fast-forward through the commercials present a bigger
problem. About 90 per cent of US viewers have remote controls, according to
research by J Walter Thompson, and VCR recordings account for up to 10 per
cent of the audience of some shows. 'There's very little we can do about
reaching those viewers,' admits Johnston.
These problems may soon be compounded by new devices which cause VCRs to
skip automatically over commercials while recording. Also, digital
technology is expected shortly which will allow certain areas of the US to
receive up to 500 channels at a time. With choices increasing, viewers will
have more opportunities to avoid commercials.
'With the new technology coming out, we have to change the whole format of
commercials,' said Martin Nisenholtz of Ogilvy and Mather's direct marketing
division. 'We have to make them either extremely informative, or an integral
part of the viewing experience.'
Nisenholtz is working with a new area of advertising, called interactive
marketing. One successful example of interactive marketing, he says, is a
video basketball game that came out last year. When game players win enough
points to get new shoes, their video counterparts get to jump higher. The
game's tennis shoes bear the Nike brand name.
'That's a painless way to get the message across,' Nisenholtz says.
Infomercials will also be increasingly popular, predicts Nisenholtz, and new
technology will give them an added twist. 'In the future,' he explains, 'you
may be able to choose a commercial about a fund manager, for example. When
you get the advertisement on the air, you could have a two-way conversation
with the television image, explaining your particular investment needs and
listening to what they have to offer.'
For ardent advertisement 'zappers', the idea of an enjoyable television
commercial may seem a contradiction in terms. But advertisers insist that if
they are to beat the 'zappers', television commercials will have to become
either more fun or more educational.

FT  01 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Hedging their bets for a more
diversified future - A look at a surprising development in the world of
accountancy and wonders what the consequences may be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT BEGAN with a random telephone call early in the morning. It ended as one
of the most significant accountancy stories of the year. Today the Financial
Times can reveal an astonishing tale in the development of professional
practice.
An anonymous tipster first revealed the intriguing activities afoot in
Birmingham. 'A lot of accountants seem to be to going in and out of the
office of Safe Bet, the betting shop chain,' said the croaky voice at the
other end of the line, before slamming down the receiver without the chance
for cross-examination.
At first, the most logical implication seemed to be that one of the more
illustrious regional firms of bookies was about to go into receivership. A
train journey and some confrontational questioning proved that the truth was
far more shocking.
'Er, we were hoping to give this as an exclusive to the Racing Times,' said
Mr John Strate-Lace, senior partner of Honest &amp; John, the accountants, when
confronted. 'We are about to make a big announcement.' We were sitting in
the back room of a large betting shop, our voices almost drowned by the
results of the 3.30 at Newmarket.
What had happened was a merger between Honest &amp; John, one of the UK's
better-known local firms of number crunchers, and Safe Bet, a rather more
racy outfit altogether, which specialised in making a living from betting.
'The idea first came to me when I was walking into, er, past one of the
branches a few months ago,' said Strate-Lace. 'They called themselves turf
accountants and bookmakers. We were chartered accountants and bookkeepers.
The link seemed so profitable, er, I mean logical,' he explained.
To an outsider, it seemed a rather unorthodox combination. But the firm was
unrepentant. 'Why not?' said Mr John Wyde-Boi, managing partner. 'Everyone
else is diversifying. We must survive and respond to our customers' needs as
flexibly as possible. This is a valuable new form of strategic alliance.'
His argument had some credence. In the last few months, both Ernst &amp; Young
and Price Waterhouse have hired politicians to work in their consultancy
divisions. Coopers &amp; Lybrand brought in a treasury management specialist.
KPMG Peat Marwick has hired a merchant banker in its corporate finance
division, to add to its growing ranks of actuaries and those from other
professions.
Most of the large firms are involved in an increasingly diverse range of
services: executive recruitment, management buy-outs, relocation,
environmental consulting, corporate strategy.
But betting? That seemed to be carrying things a little too far.
Mr 'Brown' Tweed, owner of Safe Bet, disagreed. 'Betting has a long and
distinguished history. Arguably it's the oldest business activity in the
world. It started centuries before double-entry bookkeeper was even a
twinkle in a medieval monk's eye. And think of the notable people who
indulge.'
'Robert Maxwell?' I ventured, knowing the tycoon's penchant for an
occasional but extravagant flutter on the roulette wheel.
'Well, maybe he's not such a good example,' he said. 'But what right do we
have to turn a customer away? After all, the accountancy firms were happy to
work for Maxwell for years.'
'We don't see any contradiction between our businesses,' added Strate-Lace.
'This is a competitive world. Our clients expect us to be able to service
all their needs. There is an obvious synergy with betting. We saw clear
mutual advantages and are delighted with the results.'
His argument focused around three key points. First, Safe Bet would provide
an ideal way to spread the operations of Honest &amp; John geographically,
taking advantage of Safe Bet's 25 outlets across the West Midlands. Second,
it would fulfil the apparently widespread needs of business and personal
clients to indulge in an occasional flutter.
Finally, it would lead to the development of new products. The accountancy
partners and senior betting staff were working together to develop a range
of alternative methods of finance and currency hedging from horse-racing,
not to mention new personal financial products. Clients would be charged a
proportion of the winnings as a contingency fee. If the bets lost, they
would be billed at modest hourly rates.
'Brown's understanding of probabilities might even lead to us being able to
develop a revolutionary new and effective technique for audit sampling which
would allow us to detect fraud,' said Strate-Lace excitedly. 'Frankly if
litigation against accountants by disgruntled investors is going to become a
crap shoot, we may as well at least be prepared.'
At the very least, it opened up a range of new betting activities. 'We're
devising new books on voting for the deputy president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and on the likelihood of future
mergers between accounting firms,' said Tweed. 'We've even got one on the
prospect for litigation reform to reduce the damage to accountants of being
sued. But that's for real gamblers. The odds are much longer.'
There were many other little benefits. The new software packages designed by
the accountancy firm's information technology unit would provide an
unparalleled way to store and retrieve data on horse probabilities, for
instance, and their knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations help make stronger
predictions. The bookie's expertise would boost the partners' ability to
predict changes in forthcoming budgets.
The merger - which both sides stressed was taking place on equal terms -
will lead to a new firm called Honest &amp; John. Each office of either business
will in future combine both functions. That will give the betting shops
access to some of the more respectable high street locations. It will also
ensure that even during the recession, when the accountants are less busy,
the premises will be in use for longer hours at the weekends by punters.
'It will be a useful way to save us from having to fire our graduate
recruits while we have relatively little accounting work for them to do at
the moment,' confided Mr Wyde-Boi. 'We will second them into the betting
operations.'
While the larger accountancy firms could afford to send managers on Outward
Bound courses to test their suitability for partnership, Honest &amp; John would
put theirs out to stadia around the country on weekends as Safe Bet field
representatives.
There would also be scope for partners to spend periods in the betting
shops. 'We are great believers in our profession's ethical rules which call
for regular partner rotation,' said Wyde-Boi. 'It gives them a fresh
perspective and keeps them independent.'
'Frankly, the one thing that concerns me is the way these accountants
dress,' said Tweed, brushing cigarette ash from his dog-check jacket and
pushing his hat further back on his head with a quick poke of the finger on
the rim. 'Grey suits will have to be banned from public view.'
I called the Institute of Chartered Accountants to see whether they approved
of this unusual development in the activities of the profession. But an
official said that nothing in the by-laws or ethical guidelines precluded
mergers with betting shops. Honest &amp; John could continue to be called

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories defend council costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative campaign for the county council elections next month would
be based squarely on the proposition that Tory councils cost less, Sir
Norman Fowler, the party chairman said yesterday.
Opening the campaign, Sir Norman and Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, responded directly to Labour's claim on Tuesday that average
council tax bills under Labour councils were Pounds 14 less than under Tory
councils, by publishing their own figures.
The average council tax bill for a two-person household would be Pounds 456,
Mr Howard said, compared with Pounds 486 per home under the poll tax and
Pounds 514 under the rates four years ago.
The figure is an arithmetic average, and Mr Howard acknowledged that it was
affected by the increase in government grant paid for by a rise in Value
Added Tax to soften the poll tax and also by the tight government control on
local spending.
The Tories argue that Labour's figures simply reflect the fact that
Labour-controlled areas tend to have lower property prices.
The true comparison, they say, is between the tax levied on houses of
equivalent value. On that basis the average council tax for a band C
property (Pounds 52,000-Pounds 68,000) under Conservative councils is Pounds
456 compared with Pounds 563 for a band C property under Labour.
Sir Norman promised that the Tory campaign would be better than it was in
1989, but was cautious in making predictions about the number of councillors
and councils the party might gain.
In 1989 the Conservatives made net gains of just under 100 seats and took
the number of the 47 counties in England and Wales it controlled to 18.
Then, however, the Liberals and the Social Democrats were self-destructing.
The centre-ground will be more fiercely contested this time.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gummer seeks EC farm cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is pressing her European Community partners to agree to more
stringent curbs on agricultural spending, Mr John Gummer, minister of
agriculture, told the Commons last night.
He welcomed progress in reforming the common agricultural policy, but warned
that unless further action was taken there was a danger that spending would
exceed the guideline set for next year.
Mr Gummer insisted: 'any increase in the guideline remains out of the
question'.
He described the price fixing proposals so far made by the European
Commission as 'disappointing', identifying wine, beef, fruit and vegetables,
olive oil and rice among the products which should be subject to reduced
expenditure.
Mr Gummer stressed: 'We need to bring spending under control otherwise
decisions made later will be much tougher and difficult'.
Underlining the improvements that had already taken place in farmers'
incomes, Mr Gummer said changes to the CAP had reduced the uncertainty which
had hung over agriculture so that the prospects for Britain's farmers were
brighter than they had been for a number of years.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, branded the CAP a 'disaster',
saying it was not reforms which gave farmers more hope but the rise in
support prices to them after the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism.
A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to secure adequate
reform of the common agricultural policy to prevent exorbitant costs to
taxpayers was defeated by 96 votes (209-113).

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Disclosure row clouds arms-to-Iraq
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE Scott yesterday gave a forthright 50-minute briefing in his
inquiry into the export of arms and dual-use equipment to iraq.
But with wrangling over the disclosure of sensitive information, it was
uncertain whether he might be prevented from getting to the bottom of the
affair.
A published exchange of letters between Lord Justice Scott and Sir Robin
Butler, head of the civil service, showed that Sir Robin - with the backing
of Mr John Major - had tried to persuade Lord Justice Scott to agree to
ground rules covering circumstances under which official information should
be disclosed in public hearings and those where it should be heard in
camera.
Lord Justice Scott's response makes clear that the test he will use in
deciding whether to conduct a hearing in closed session is whether
disclosure would 'cause serious injury to the interests of the nation'. The
robustness of his response should at least ease fears that private hearings
might be used to suppress material which was merely embarrassing.
Lord Justice Scott is thus adopting a similar position to Judge Brian
Smedley QC, who in the Matrix-Churchill trial overruled 'public interest
immunity certificates' which stated there was no need for confidential
information to be given to the courts. The government is also encouraging
openness by effectively giving witnesses immunity from prosecution.
A disclosure which served to feed doubts yesterday was that an obscure
158-year-old Act would prevent Lord Justice Scott from taking evidence on
oath.
The judge shrugged this off - he found it 'a little laughable' to be
circumscribed in this way and he thought it 'highly unlikely' he was going
to be told a series of lies.
But some thought the admission significant. The lack of power to give
evidence on oath was cited by Lord Denning as one of the main disadvantages
of the inquiry into the Profumo affair in 1963.
Also, Lord Justice Scott did not deny yesterday that he might not get access
to all the papers he wanted, although he said he was not aware of any
difficulty so far presented by the absence of documents he had requested but
not yet received.
Last week Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, admitted
that the Ministry of Defence might have destroyed some of the documents the
inquiry had requested.
Witnesses are to be invited - rather than compelled - to give oral evidence.
Most of the main figures, including Mr Major and Mr Alan Clark, the former
defence minister, have indicated their willingness to appear. Baroness
Thatcher, the former prime minister, was not available for comment
yesterday, but is believed to be likely to consent.
Lord Justice Scott said yesterday Sir Hal Miller, the former Conservative MP
who refused to give evidence to the cross-party trade and industry select
committee's Supergun inquiry, had given 'every indication' that he would
assist the inquiry if invited.
The inquiry is only likely to cause serious discomfort to the government if
it uncovers evidence of transgressions by current ministers. Some people
argue that the present administration could derive positive benefit from any
discrediting of the Thatcher regime.
Labour last year tried systematically and unsuccessfully to pin blame on Mr
Major for the extent of British exports of dual - use equipment to Iraq
after the release of previously - secret government documents in the
Matrix-Churchill trial.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Broad reform of property lease law
announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced a far-reaching reform of the law on
commercial property leases.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, announced measures affecting future leases
which would limit the liability of a tenant which passes its lease onto
another tenant.
Separately, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said a
consultation paper would be issued shortly to examine three aspects of
commercial leases which have caused concern: upward-only rent reviews,
confidentiality clauses and the procedures for resolving disputes. He
stressed that no legislation would affect existing contracts.
While landlords were relieved that the proposals would make little impact on
existing leases, some were concerned about the impact on property values in
the future. 'This is a tenant-biased proposal,' said Mr John Parry,
president of the British Property Federation. 'It will make property less
attractive for investors.'
Under Lord Mackay's proposals, a tenant that moved out of a property might
be required to guarantee the rent payments of the next tenant but would not
be held responsible if the lease was subsequently passed on. This would be a
considerable help to tenants, which can currently be held responsible for
rent arrears for the lifetime of a lease - generally 25 years.
Lord Mackay said the government would restrict the implementation of most of
the 1988 Law Commission's recommendations on this matter to existing leases.
The legislation will be introduced when parliamentary time permits.
Where existing leases are concerned, he said that landlords wanting to sue a
former tenant for the rent arrears built up by a subsequent tenant would
have to claim within nine months of the money becoming due.
The proposals were welcomed by tenant representatives, despite concerns that
they will do little to help businesses that are currently faced with bills
for rent arrears run up subsequent tenants.
'This is a great day for hundreds of thousands of small businesses,' said
the Property Market Reform Group, a tenant's lobbying group, while the CBI
welcomed the proposals as a tremendous breakthrough'.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Commons approves legal aid
restriction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs last night approved new regulations restricting eligibility for legal
aid, and rejected alternative proposals by the Law Society.
The regulations, which take effect from April 12, were approved by a
government majority of 45 (304-259).
But the measures were attacked by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs and by Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn (C Perth and Kinross), a former solicitor-general for
Scotland.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the junior Scottish office minister, promised
that the regulations would be reviewed in due course, but said: 'I cannot
hold out any hope with regard to the representations by the Law Society'.
Responding to protests that people with modest resources unable to qualify
for income support would be hardest hit by the regulations, he said such
complaints would be made wherever the line restricting eligibility was
drawn.
The minister emphasised the escalation in the cost of legal aid throughout
Britain - on current trends estimated to reach Pounds 2bn by 1995-96 - and
insisted 'something had to be done'.
Pointing out that it was envisaged that legal aid expenditure would rise by
10 per cent a year for the next three years he said Lord Mackay, the Lord
Chancellor, had not been 'ungenerous' in framing the regulations.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton forecast that the numbers receiving legal aid
would increase steadily by the mid-1990s.
Sir Ivan Lawrence QC (C Burton), chairman of the Commons home affairs
committee, denied that 14m people would be denied legal aid as a result of
the regulations.
He joined other MPs in calling for reforms in the administration of the
courts to provide greater value for money.

THE government yesterday announced the allocation of Pounds 15m in
supplementary credit approvals for recycling schemes run by local
authorities in England.
Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said priority had been given to
schemes to collect waste oil and ozone-depleting CFCs.
In a written reply, he said credit approvals had been authorised for 161
authorities covering 307 schemes, ranging from home composting projects to
mini-recycling centres.
Supplementary credit approvals allow local authorities to borrow for
specific types of capital investment, beyond the limit set by their basic
credit approval.

BRITISH COAL must improve its productivity even further, Lord Wakeham, the
leader of the Lords, warned yesterday, highlighting competition from cheaper
coal imports from countries such as the US and Australia.
'British Coal has more than doubled its productivity over the last seven
years and this is a major achievement. Over the last few months it has done
even better,' he said.
'However, further improvement is essential. British Coal's productivity is
still only 20 per cent - 35 per cent of that in America or Australia, its
deep mined costs are two or three times higher.'
In the Commons last night, a Labour motion protesting at the end of
production at 18 collieries and accusing ministers of 'failure to develop a
long term strategy' for meeting energy requirements was defeated by 163
votes to 111.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Security service cleared on phone
taps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE security service has been cleared of installing bugging devices or
tapping telephones unlawfully, by the two judges who scrutinise its work,
Alison Smith writes.
Sir Thomas Bingham, the commissioner who reviews intercepting
communications, and Lord Hustice Stuart-Smith, the commissioner who reviews
the security service, both use their annual reports to express confidence
the service is not acting illegally.
The assurances do not refer to specific incidents, but are clearly directed
at rumours that the so-called 'Squidgy' and 'Camillagate' tapes, allegedly
recordings of a telephone conversations between members of the royal family
and friends, had originated within the security service.
Commenting on newspaper reports of eavesdropping operations, Sir Thomas
said: 'Such stories are, in my experience without exception, false. They
give . . an entirely misleading impression both of the extent of official
interception and of the targets against which interception is directed'.
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said he based his opinion on the tight control
within the system and the fact that operations were so complex that
resources were unlikely to be squandered on them and they would be hard to
conceal.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Law Lords put Sunday trading in
doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities were yesterday given the power to clamp down on shops that
open on Sundays, after the Law Lords dismissed an appeal by B&amp;Q, the DIY
chain, ending its five-year legal battle over Sunday trading laws in England
and Wales.
Opponents of Sunday opening urged councils to use their powers, but
retailers already trading on Sundays vowed to continue. They said they would
intensify pressure on the government to introduce new legislation to replace
the 1950 Shops Act, widely seen as impractical and outdated.
The Law Lords said that following a European Court judgment in December it
was clear that European rules, which prohibited quantitative restrictions on
trade between EC states, did not apply to national legislation prohibiting
retailers from opening their premises on Sundays.
B&amp;Q had argued that the ban on Sunday opening was incompatible with
free-trade principles of the European Community. This argument was rejected
by Mr Justice Hoffmann in a 1990 ruling. The DIY chain appealed to the Law
Lords who referred the issue to the European Court for the second time since
1988.
Giving judgment yesterday, Lord Goff said the European Court's second answer
was so 'unequivocal' that B&amp;Q's appeal must fail.
The Shopping Hours Reform Council, which is calling for partial deregulation
of Sunday opening, said the ruling cleared the way for the government to
bring forward its proposals for new legislation.
'Shoppers, shopworkers and shopkeepers will all raise three cheers if the
government gets a move on,' the council said.
Keep Sunday Special, the campaign group which supports only restricted
Sunday opening, agreed on the need for reform. But Dr Michael Schluter,
campaign director, said it was 'totally unacceptable for the multiples to
flout existing Sunday trading law.
Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union,
agreed there was 'no longer any excuse' for retailers to disobey the law.
Dr Schluter added that an opportunity for reform already existed in the
private member's bill introduced by Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, due
to begin its report stage on May 14. However, the bill, based broadly on the
Keep Sunday Special's proposals, is unlikely to become law, and opponents
say it is riddled with anomalies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, last week promised a draft bill to
reform the Sunday trading laws would be published within the next few
months, together with a paper about its impact.
Among retailers, Mr George Robertson, Sainsbury's senior legal adviser, said
the Lords' ruling would not affect its plans to open on Sundays.
Sainsbury's is trying to persuade local authorities to use their powers
under Section 48 of the Shops Act to make exemption orders allowing grocery
shops to open between 10am and 4pm if a majority of local retailers is in
favour.
Tesco also pledged to continue opening, while Safeway said it had no
intention of disappointing its shoppers. But Marks and Spencer and John
Lewis Partnership said they would continue to uphold the law and not open on
Sundays.
Only a handful of councils, including Kirklees (which has been in dispute
with Tesco), Norwich, Stoke, Torfaen and The Wrekin, have continued to
enforce Sunday trading laws, but others, including Waverley, Horsham,
Ashford, Kennet, Cambridge, and Wyre Forest, have indicated they would seek
prosecutions or injunctions if the House of Lords upheld the European Court
ruling. Opponents of Sunday shopping believe at least 20 others may follow
suit.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs 'back reform'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NARROW majority of Labour MPs want the party to back electoral reform, a
survey showed last night, as the Plant committee inquiry into alternative
electoral systems reached its final stages.
The survey of 128 Labour MPs for the New Statesman and Society magazine
showed 59 per cent backing the principle of electoral reform and 36 per cent
wanting to keep the first-past-the-post system.
Of those supporting electoral reform, 30 per cent favoured a German-style
Additional Member system, 16 per cent wanted the Australian-style
Alternative Vote method and 13 per cent wanted the Irish-style Single
Transferable Vote system.
Support for electoral reform is stronger among new Labour MPs.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is under pressure from within party ranks
to initiate a radical switch in Labour policy away from supporting the
existing, first-past-the-post system of elections, the survey suggests.
So far Mr Smith has given little indication that he is prepared to embrace
electoral reform, although a senior party official said yesterday that the
Labour leader would be 'pragmatic'.
Mr Smith will set out his views at the next meeting of Labour's ruling
National Executive Committee later this month. He will have then the final
results of the two-year long inquiry under Professor Raymond Plant of
Southampton university.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader of the party and a member of the Plant
committee, is strongly opposed to change. But, as the survey indicates,
there is also dispute among the pro-reformers over the prefered system from
the alternatives considered.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bank governor gloomy on deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN faces a 'fundamental weakness' in its large trade deficit which
would take many years to correct, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England, said yesterday.
He also said that the recession was probably over, though unemployment would
stay high for some time, and hinted that a cut in social security spending
might be needed to correct the growing fiscal deficit.
Answering questions from the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee,
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said a reduction in interest rates might be difficult to
sustain and would do little to strengthen an upturn.
The governor also said Britain might face problems in in keeping inflation
below the Treasury's 4 per cent target during the life of the current
parliament.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said the government remained committed to rejoining the
exchange rate mechanism at 'not too low' an exchange rate. In an unusually
frank comment he said he found 'worrying' the Treasury projection that the
UK's deficit on manufactured goods would reach Pounds 13bn this year, after
Pounds 7.5bn last year.
He said the trade gap reflected a lack of competitiveness and problems
concerning productivity, training, education and innovation. 'We're not
going to solve it (the problem) in short order,' said the governor, who is
retiring on July 1 after 10 years.
Asked by Mr Giles Radice whether he thought Britain had a structural problem
in this field, Mr Leigh-Pemberton replied 'Yes, yes.'
UK output was expected to grow by just over 1 per cent this year, with a
recovery taking root in the second half. He said the outlook for
unemployment was 'disappointing'.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he was 'sceptical' about whether a cut in interest
rates would boost the economy. 'I don't think people want to be led too
quickly into rises in spending,' he said.
In the event of a cut in base rates, which have fallen by 4 percentage
points since Britain's exit from the ERM, banks and building societies might
not be able to pass on the full cut to borrowers because of tightening
competition in the banking sector.
Asked whether a hypothetical country with Britain's economic characteristics
might be thought likely to meet the government's inflation target, Mr
Leigh-Pemberton answered: 'The odds would be against it.'

FT  01 APR 93 / Corporate operators ready to take a slice of the caring
market: Today sees the implementation of the government's care in the
community initiative which moves the onus on to local councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARING for people is set to become a serious business sector with large
operators moving in to challenge small providers - as long as there is
enough finance to make it profitable.
The reforms are designed to create a 'mixed economy' in care, with local
authorities purchasing services but contracting out delivery to the private
and voluntary sec-tors.
Local authorities will be required to spend 85 per cent of social security
transfer funds - about two thirds of their total care in the community
grants - in the independent sector. That will not be hard,since local
authorities provide only a minority of places in homes. But there will be a
battle royal between competing providers for the new business.
The residential care market is something of a cottage industry, with large
numbers of small, owner-managed homes. But there is growing activity by big
corporate providers such as Takare, Westminster Health Care, Crestacare and
Ashbourne Homes, and from voluntary sector providers such as the Anchor
Housing Association and the Abbeyfield Society.
As the reforms reduce the flow of people entering residential care the
smaller homes will come under increasing pressure from corporate operators.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman of Takare - the biggest corporate provider,
still with only about 2 per cent of the market - believes many smaller homes
are not economically viable.
Many local authorities have hived off their own former homes into trusts
which will count as part of the independent sector for financing purposes.
The private sector suspects it may face unfair competition from these and
from National Health Service community services trusts, which will also be
regarded as independent providers.
The private sector is far less developed in day care and home care - which
is where growth will be. Here, initially at least, the voluntary
organisations will make the running. Today's reforms provide the biggest
opportunity yet to bring a fundamental policy shift in provision of welfare
services from public authorities to the voluntary sector.
Some household name charities are likely to become very large welfare
service organisations as a result of the reforms. The British Red Cross and
Age Concern are setting up central contracts units to support branches in
negotiations with local authorities. Even so, the voluntary sector still has
worries.
Some fear loss of independence and campaigning power if charities become too
dependent on public-sector contracts. Others fear that local authorities
will not pay an economic price for charities' services.
Many charities have had to cost their services for the first time - and
concluded that in the past they were receiving far too little in public
grants. Age Concern has expressed 'grave anxiety' about charities
subsidising public services to the detriment of other activities, stressing
that local authorities should pay an economic price for services purchased
from charities.
The private sector has similar concerns about the rates local authorities
will pay for services such home helps - unglamorous activity, but vital if
the objective of helping dependent people stay in their own homes is to be
achieved.
Ms Lucianne Sawyer, who runs Care Alternatives, a non-profitmaking
organisation in London, and is president of the UK Home Care Association,
says: 'It really doesn't make much difference whether you are a profitmaking
organisation or not, because there is so little profit there. Maintaining
quality is essential, and we insist on high standards from association
members. But they are competing with people who puts cards in newsagents'
windows. Home care will not work if it is regarded as a cheaper alternative
to residential care.'
The care in the community reforms are also being watched with keen interest
by the insurance industry. Long-term care insurance is a recent innovation
in the UK market, but since 1991 policies have been available providing
residential and home care benefits.

FT  01 APR 93 / Things will never be the same again: For better or for
worse, today, April Fool's Day, sees the launch of a range of measures from
care in the community to council tax. FT reporters pick out some of the
fresh starts in the private and the public sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Reporters

<TEXT>
THE APRIL 1 change that will affect most people is the replacement of the
poll tax by the council tax.
The council tax has won more general acceptance than the poll tax, which
prompted rioting on the streets and resignations among Tory councillors and
contributed to Mrs Thatcher's downfall. The change returns local taxation to
a property base, loosely relating it to ability to pay. The task of putting
every home into one of eight valuation bands was completed late last year,
but only from today can a householder appeal against the ruling.
The government has provided for up to 1m appeals. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that there will be many appeals to move down to a cheaper band, but
some people may appeal to move up a band in the belief that the suggestion
of a higher house value is worth a small rise in tax.
The bill for a two-person household in a band C (Pounds 52,000-68,000) home
varies from Pounds 704 in Newcastle upon Tyne to Pounds 218 in
Wellingborough, Northamptonshire.
Unemployment: Many unemployed people will be affected by today's launch of
the Training for Work scheme, which combines Employment Training, the main
training scheme for the adult jobless, with Employment Action, the work
experience scheme.
At any time there will be 150,000 people on the scheme, with about 320,000
opportunities in any year. It has a budget of Pounds 936m in 1993-94 -
Pounds 40m less than spending on ET and EA this year - and cuts training
from 26 weeks to 14 weeks.
Homelessness: For the homeless in central London today is the first day
without their nine winter shelters, closed yesterday.
The Pounds 1.5m programme to help people sleeping rough had provided 400
extra bed spaces in the shelters. Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment
minister, said those still using them would be found alternative
accommodation.
Business: West Yorkshire's main business communities of Leeds and Bradford
today partially bury their old rivalry by merging most functions of their
chambers of commerce and industry. Each will continue to represent business
in its area, but services will be run by a joint company, with equal numbers
of directors from Leeds and Bradford.
Its offices are likely to be in Pudsey, which is officially in Leeds, and
has a Leeds postcode, but parts of it have Bradford telephone numbers.
Coal: Contracts by which British Coal will sell coal worth Pounds 5.5bn to
the electricity generators over five years and provide a future for 19 mines
 -12 reprieved, six mothballed and one to be developed - take effect today
following months of wrangling over the contracts which were finally signed
earlier this week.
The protracted wrangling was one reason why last week's coal white paper was
not able to guarantee a future for a further 19 mines which have been
reprieved or mothballed.
Uncertainty over their fate will continue while British Coal negotiates
additional contracts with the generators. The generators have contracted to
sell the power produced to the regional electricity companies for about
Pounds 13bn.
Health: A total of 132 National Health Service hospitals, community services
and ambulance services become trusts managing their own day-to-day affairs.
It is the third wave since the launch of the government's health reforms in
1991. When a fourth wave comes on stream next April almost all hospital and
community services will be delivered by locally managed trusts.
Army: The army's new baby is the Royal Logistic Corps, formed from the Royal
Corps of Transport, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Pioneer Corps,
the Army Catering Corps and the postal and courier services of the Royal
Engineers.
BBC: Not everyone at the corporation is laughing on April Fool's Day, which
sees the start of Producer Choice - the system which will give producers
full control of their budgets. Many people are expected to lose their jobs
in the process.
Humour: Appropriately, April 1 sees the launch of The Cartoonist, a
fortnightly newspaper devoted to cartoons.
The publication, which costs Pounds 1.20, will follow the format of a
national newspaper with cartoons on politics and current events in the front
half and sports at the back.

FT  01 APR 93 / New approach to an ageing problem: Today sees the
implementation of the government's care in the community initiative which
moves the onus on to local councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S population is ageing. The number of people of pensionable age rose
16 per cent between 1971 and 1991 and will increase a further 38 per cent -
to 14.6m - by 2031. There will be twice as many people over 65 in the
Britain of 2021 as there were in 1951.
Within this ageing process there will be a particularly sharp rise in the
very elderly, who demand the most extensive - and expensive - medical and
social care. People in their late 80s consume about 10 times the health
expenditure of 40-year-olds.
During the 1980s the increase in the numbers of elderly, coupled with a
decline in long-stay hospital provision, led to rapid growth in the numbers
accommodated in private homes. It was good news for the private residential
care sector, but social security benefits paid the bills. Places in private
homes almost quadrupled from 39,300 in 1981 to 155,300 10 years later.
Social security payments for people in private and charitable residential
and nursing homes have jumped sharply from Pounds 10m in 1979 to Pounds
2.5bn this year.
The care in the community reforms coming into effect today are designed to
redirect care away from institutional settings towards supporting people in
their own homes wherever possible.

FT  01 APR 93 / Councils doubt adequacy of age funding provisions: Today
sees the implementation of the government's care in the community initiative
which moves the onus on to local councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW POLICY changes have been heralded with a more potent cocktail of
goodwill and doubt than today's care in the community reforms.
Politicians of all parties, doctors and social workers applaud the central
objective - to care for elderly and handicapped people in the community
rather than in institutions. That is the goodwill. The doubt arises over
finance.
One of the political objectives of the reforms is to end a bias in public
funding arrangements that has encouraged the growth of residential care
because social security benefits have been available to pay for it. From
today local authority social services departments will be responsible for
deciding how individuals' needs should be met, either in residential care or
at home.
The previous system was demand-led - people who qualified for social
security support could use their entitlement like a residential care voucher
when looking for a home. The system's replacement will be cash-limited
within the overall local government financing structure.
In 1993-94, Pounds 399m will be transferred from the social security budget
to local authorities - based on calculations of the number of new residents
who would have entered homes this year had the old system continued - plus
an additional Pounds 140m in start-up costs. The social security transfers
will rise to Pounds 1.05bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.56bn in 1995-96.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, squeezed more money from the
Treasury than her critics expected in the current difficult public spending
climate. Doubts still remain about whether the money is enough.
The Commons health committee said last month that its efforts to judge the
adequacy of funding had been 'hampered by a lack of transparency about the
assumptions used by the Department of Health'. Some local authorities
believe the government had under-estimated the number of people who would
have entered homes this year under the old system.
People living in homes before today's changes are excluded from the new
arrangements, but many already suffer from a shortfall between levels of
social security payment and residential home fees. Ministers hope local
authorities will use their bargaining muscle as bulk purchasers of
residential care to drive prices down. Some local authority leaders and home
operators are not as optimistic.
Mr David Wigley, chief executive of Methodist Homes, one of the biggest
charitable residential care providers, says his charity already spends
Pounds 400,000 a year subsidising social security-financed residents in its
homes. A Methodist Homes' survey of 41 English and Welsh local authorities
revealed that more than one third would limit expenditure on residential
care under the new system to social security levels.
For elderly people without personal resources, the gap between income
support and home fees is sometimes met by relatives. Others depend on
charities, but a number of these are withdrawing from topping-up payments.
Mr Geoff Smith, general manager of the charity Counsel and Care for the
Elderly, says: 'We will meet existing commitments, but have concluded that
it is not an appropriate use of charitable funds to subsidise the social
security system. The reforms will not work properly unless they are
adequately funded. But the problem is that inadequate funding will not
necessarily show in a coherent way. Poverty often just disappears into
individual misery.'

FT  01 APR 93 / British Tourist Authority gets temporary chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEMPORARY chairman is to take charge of the British Tourist Authority
today because the government has not found a permanent head nearly two weeks
after it was given a shortlist of four suitable candidates.
Mr John Lewis, a solicitor and director of several leisure companies, will
serve as interim chairman of the authority for up to two months while Mr
Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, attempts to find a replacement
for Mr William Davis, whose tenure ended yesterday.
Mr John Jarvis, chairman of the Jarvis hotel group, will replace Mr Davis as
the chair-man of the English Tourist Board on a temporary basis.
The government had hoped to have a new joint chairman of the two bodies in
place by today but it is understood Mr Brooke has not yet interviewed the
candidates put forward by headhunters Tyzack Accord. The two-day-a-week job
carries a salary of Pounds 35,000. Mr Jarvis and Mr Lewis will each spend
one day a week running the two organisations.
Mr Brooke said: 'It is vital that we get the right person with the right
skills and experience. Until then, the appointment of Mr Lewis and Mr Jarvis
will ensure that the two organisations continue to work effectively.'
Mr Lewis and Mr Jarvis are members of the respective boards of the
organisations they will head.
The BTA will also need a new chief executive to replace Mr Michael
Medlicott, who is leaving next Thursday to become European vice-president of
Delta Air Lines, the US carrier. Tyzack, which had also been asked to look
for a chief executive, is thought to have given the government a short list
last week. Candidates are believed to have been interviewed on Monday by Mr
Davis and other BTA board members.
Travel executives have expressed concern that the delay in appointing
replacements for Mr Davis and Mr Medlicott will weaken the UK tourist
industry's promotional efforts in the run-up to the summer season. They have
criticised the government for not ensuring the new appointments were
announced earlier.

FT  01 APR 93 / Students prepare to change masters: The challenges facing
the 550 colleges that shrug off council control today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THE further-education and sixth-form colleges in the UK today throw off
the shackles of local education authority control and begin what Mr John
Patten, education secretary, describes as an unparalleled expansion in
British vocational education.
There are more than 550 of the colleges, which provide a range of academic
and vocational courses for more than 1m students over the age of 16. They
have now become independent organisations funded directly by the government.
They are also preparing to increase their student numbers by 25 per cent
over the next three years, with funds for an extra 250,000 students provided
in the Autumn Statement.
The main aim of the expansion is to raise the numbers staying on in
education after the school-leaving age of 16. Fewer than half of
17-year-olds are currently in full-time education or training - far fewer
than in almost every other European Community country.
Mr Patten sees raising the level of staying on in the UK as a critical
supply-side step in the raising of workforce skills.
The 25 per cent student increase is only one of the colleges' challenges. Mr
Patten is also urging them to use their new freedom to move away from the
'all-singing, all-dancing, all-providing' model.
'I want colleges to develop a diversity of mission, while retaining core
access for people without basic skills,' he says. 'Colleges must gauge their
market and develop in whatever directions they judge most likely to bring
them success.'
The newly independent colleges are striving to build closer links with
employers, for whom they already provide sandwich courses and block release
and part-time day release training.
Business executives fill more than half the places on the college boards,
and colleges will be expected to carry out regular surveys of local business
to ensure that they are meeting employers' needs.
Mr Patten is also keen to increase the quality of further education, after a
recent Audit Commission report showed that more than one in three further
education students fails to finish their course.
A further-education charter in the autumn will require the colleges to
publish information on performance, including exam results, drop-out rates
and where students go after completing their courses.
Improvements in quality will be encouraged by changes in the funding of
colleges now under consideration by the Further Education Funding Council,
the new quango that distributes government funds to colleges.
The council has carried out an audit of every college to ensure that
financial controls and systems are in place for them to take over
responsibility for their destinies.
Mr William Stubbs, the council's chief executive, says: 'Colleges have made
remarkable progress in less than 12 months to prepare for independence.' Mr
Patten shares this confidence: 'Lots of bright-eyed college principals are
relishing their new freedom,' he says. 'It's exciting, dangerous and
daunting - and they love it.'
Some appear to find the future less exciting and more daunting than others.
Almost half the colleges feel unsure about whether they can meet the
ambitious expansion targets set for them by the government, according to a
survey in last week's Times Higher Educational Supplement.
However, Mr Jack Chapman, principal of West Kent College in Tonbridge,
probably speaks for the majority when he welcomes independence day.
'The role of colleges will be brought into sharper focus under market
conditions. Colleges provide a product, education, to a group of customers
which includes parents, local businesses and employers. The changes will
encourage us to provide products which serve their combined needs.'

FT  01 APR 93 / Job subsidy pioneer hits at schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMICS professor who inspired the government experiment to pay
subsidies to employers which take on the long-term unemployed has sharply
criticised the way pilot subsidy schemes are being introduced.
Professor Dennis Snower, of Birkbeck College, London University, is
particularly angered by what he believes are inadequate measures to prevent
employers sacking existing workers in order to hire those who carry the
subsidy.
Two of the four pilot schemes, in Tyneside and east Kent, will each cover
250 people unemployed for at least two years. The other two, in Devon and
Cornwall and south London, will each involve 250 people unemployed for more
than four years.
The scheme will be voluntary and employers will receive Pounds 60 a week for
each person hired for the first six months and Pounds 30 for the following
six months.
The Department of Employment said employers would have to give an
undertaking that they would not displace existing employees and that no
final decision had yet been made on how to ensure that displacement does not
happen.
Prof Snower said that if there is widespread displacement the scheme will
not be cost-effective, as it is based on the idea that the government will
save on benefits for the unemployed which are, in effect, transferred to
employers in the shape of job subsidies.
'If the pilots turn out to be costly and ineffective in reducing
unemployment they will probably be deemed a failure and plans for the
national adoption of the policy may well be scrapped. Then, in my opinion,
we will have missed a unique opportunity to revive the British labour
market,' Prof Snower said.

FT  01 APR 93 / Sharp rise seen in orders for manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturing industry is experiencing 'considerable growth' of
output and orders, the latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers
shows.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its purchasing
managers' index rose from 51.2 per cent in February to 53.9 per cent last
month. The index, based on a weighted average of movements of several
components, including new orders, output and employment, was above the 50
per cent level that indicates expansion in the manufacturing economy for the
second consecutive month.
The output and order components of the index rose sharply in March and have
now indicated increasing levels of manufacturing activity and new orders
from home and abroad for five consecutive months. The output index rose to
58.6 per cent in last month from 53.8 per cent in February, while the
new-orders index advanced to 57.1 per cent from 53.9 per cent.
The institute, which says it represents UK purchasing managers with overall
spending power of Pounds 250bn a year, said many companies had reported an
improvement in foreign and domestic trade that exceeded normal seasonal
trends.
However, the recovery in industry's fortunes has yet to have a positive
impact on employment. The employment index increased slightly last month to
47.2 per cent from February's 46.1 per cent.

FT  01 APR 93 / Fears of forestry sell-off sparked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was accused yesterday of planning to privatise the Forestry
Commission after Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, who is also responsible
for the commission, revealed that he had set up a committee 'to review
options for the ownership and management of Forestry Commission woodlands'.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's shadow environmental protection secretary, said
privatisation of the commission's woodland would mean less public access and
diminish the drive for conservation.
Mr Lang said in a Commons written answer that a committee of officials from
the Treasury, Ministry of Agriculture, Welsh Office and the Environment
Department under the chairmanship of the Scottish Office was also reviewing
the effectiveness of forestry investment incentives.
The commission is the biggest landowner in Britain, possessing 1.14m
hectares or 5 per cent of the land area of the UK.

FT  01 APR 93 / Possible face lift for Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimbledon, home of tennis stars past and present such as Michael Stich
(left) and Rod Laver could have a face-lift if proposals unveiled yesterday
by the All-England Lawn Tennis Club are approved. The plans, by consultants
Building Design Partnership, aim to improve facilities for spectators,
players and officials.
Under the proposals Number One court will be demolished to make way for a
facilities building, and a new show court will be built. Planning permission
is being sought and work could begin by 1995. The project will be financed
by the issue of debentures.

FT  01 APR 93 / Drivers in capital face road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVERS could be charged for driving in London on a pay-as-you-go basis by
the end of the decade, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said
yesterday.
The aim would be to tackle congestion by making people think twice before
taking cars on the roads at busy times.
The most likely system would require drivers to fit in their cars, at their
own expense, electronic meters which would clock up charges by communicating
with roadside beacons. Drivers would pay by inserting rechargeable 'smart
cards' into their meters at the start of each journey and the meters would
deduct payments as journeys progressed.
The controversial plans emerged as the Department of Transport published the
results of a study of road pricing technology by the University of Newcastle
upon Tyne.
Mr MacGregor said: 'We have to consider new ways of preventing road
congestion in London from getting worse as car ownership grows. Charging
drivers for using the capital's crowded roads is one possible solution.'
No decisions would be taken until a three-year transport department
investigation into the options for in London is concluded next year.
The report says that although there is not yet a suitable road-pricing
system, the technology is moving fast and the political obstacles are likely
to prove greater than the technological ones.
The Automobile Association said yesterday that motorists were already paying
for roads through taxation, and additional charges could not be justified:
'The key to solving London's traffic problems is to invest in public
transport.'

FT  01 APR 93 / London Ambulance board dissolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Ambulance Service board was dissolved yesterday after a
devastatingly critical report on the failure of the capital's computerised
ambulance control system.
Under arrangements approved by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
South West Thames regional health authority will oversee the service -
contrary to the trend towards devolved management in the National Health
Service.
Mrs Bottomley said yesterday that previous accountability arrangements had
left the ambulance service, board and health authority 'unclear about their
respective roles and responsibilities'.
Last month's report highlighted a series of management failures in the
London Ambulance Service, the biggest in the world, culminating in chaos
when the computer system collapsed.
It said the board had failed to seek or obtain enough information to
exercise its responsibilities and Mrs Bottomley gave the regional health
authority a month to produce a better structure.
As yesterday's changes were announced, evidence emerged that the service's
reputation for unreliability may have begun to cost it contracts in the
National Health Service market.
It has lost the contract to provide non-emergency hospital transport
services in Newham, east London and to Essex Ambulance Service. Other
contracts may be at risk.
Mr Martin Gorham, London Ambulance Service chief executive, said no
purchasing authority considering withdrawing contracts had said explicitly
it was because of concerns over the quality of performance, but he accepted
that 'an issue in determining contracts must be performance'.
South West Thames will set up a committee of the authority to oversee the
ambulance service.
It will also establish an advisory group of specialists in information
technology, accident and emergency medicine, industrial relations, finance
and marketing.
The authority plans other mechanisms to increase scrutiny and 'provide
safety valves in case of any failure in line management'.
These will include an annual report concentrating on performance;
performance reports to MPs, community health councils and local authorities,
and regular meetings between senior managers and full-time union officers.

FT  01 APR 93 / Chemical industry spending falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending by the chemical industry, which usually accounts for a
sixth of UK manufacturing capital expenditure, fell 11 per cent last year to
Pounds 2.176bn. Spending is expected to fall a further 10 per cent this year
to Pounds 2bn, a Chemical Industries Association survey of 65 companies
shows.
The survey concludes that in spite of the emergence of some 'green shoots'
the outlook for 1993 is another tough year, with only a slow recovery for
the industry.
There will be no early reversal of the industry's downward trend in
investment spending, says the report. Capital expenditure is expected to
rise to Pounds 2.4bn next year, but fall back to Pounds 2.15bn the following
year.
The south-east and East Anglia will receive the largest share of investment
 -35 per cent - over the next three years, the north-west and Midlands will
receive 29 per cent, the north-east and Humberside 21 per cent and the
south-west 3 per cent. Wales will gain 3 per cent and Scotland 9 per cent.
This high investment in the south-east reflects the predominance of spending
by the pharmaceuticals industry - highly concentrated in the region.
About 43 per cent of investment over the next three years will be for
pharmaceuticals, 25 per cent for specialities, 23 per cent petrochemicals
and plastics, 7 per cent basic organics and fertilisers and 5 per cent
dyestuffs and pigments. Two years ago petrochemicals and plastics was the
largest sector, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the total.
The proportion of spending on the environment increased from 14 per cent of
the total last year to 23 per cent by 1995. Over the next three years
environmentally-related capital spending is estimated at Pounds 1.18bn, in
real terms 22 per cent higher than in 1992.
The proportion of that spending attributable to legislative requirements
increases from 53 per cent in 1992 to 64 per cent in 1995. The association
says UK companies have lost business to overseas competitors because of lack
of clarity in procedures and administrative delays for the recently
introduced integrated pollution control. It said there was a threat of
further loss to countries where environmental and waste handling procedures
were less onerous.
The UK's 10 per cent fall in capital expenditure this year compares with
falls of 7.5 per cent in Germany, 10 per cent in Italy, 8 per cent in
Belgium, 6.5 per cent in the Netherlands, and 5 per cent in Spain.

FT  01 APR 93 / Dismissed Hoover chief raps media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the Hoover executives dismissed over the company's controversial free
flights offer last night laid part of the blame for the marketing fiasco on
the media.
Mr Brian Webb, former vice-president of UK marketing, said: 'The offer was
absolutely genuine, and had we been left alone to sort out the few problems
we encountered everything would have been all right.
'But the public was being bombarded with so many doubts and incorrect facts.
The media got hold of a few minor problems and advertised them. They raised
doubts in the public's minds and as a result we were inundated with
thousands of phone calls we just couldn't handle.'
About 200,000 people are estimated to have bought a Hoover product worth at
least Pounds 100 to qualify for two free air tickets to Europe or the US.
Last night Mr Steve Delahaye, Mid Glamorgan deputy trading standards
officer, said there was no evidence that Hoover had broken the law. 'This
type of promotion would be covered by the Trades Description Act, but there
is no offence unless people have actually been refused a flight.'
Meanwhile, it has emerged that the two travel agents handling Hoover's free
flights offer increased their Association of British Travel Agents bonding
at the turn of the year to enable them to boost sales of associated services
such as accommodation and car hire.
Free Flights Europe of Watford and Your Leisure of Warwick are members of
Abta, which sets bonding levels to ensure that customers' money can be
refunded if the company collapses.
The free flights are not guaranteed by Abta because holidaymakers' contracts
are with Hoover, but Abta would be responsible for services bought directly
from travel agents.
Mr William Brenchley, managing director of Brevis Marketing Services, Free
Flights Europe's parent company, said he arranged a new bond to cover
additional business generated by the Hoover offer after discussions with
Abta. Mr Michael Dunkley, a director of Your Leisure, said his company also
increased its bond.
Mr Brenchley said he would investigate any specific allegations that his
company gave preference to Hoover applicants who agreed to spend money on
extra services, but if any such incidents did occur 'it was not the result
of management instructions'.

RELUCTANCE by some component manufacturers to keep supplying the Leyland Daf
truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, is again threatening efforts to sell it
as a going concern, its administrative receivers warned yesterday.
The warning came as a further 349 Leyland Daf workers were made redundant.
Most of the redundancies - 273 - were at the Leyland trucks plant, leaving a
workforce of 273. The remaining 76 jobs went at the Albion axle plant,
Glasgow, leaving a workforce of 342.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM today the average annual water and sewerage bill will be Pounds 185, a
rise of 9.5 per cent on last year's Pounds 169.
Bills in households with meters, which are on average about 10 per cent
higher than bills in unmetered households, are expected to rise more slowly,
by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.
Ofwat, the water regulator, is investigating whether metered households are
being charged more than unmetered ones for the same amount of water, or
whether they use more water or are located in areas with generally high
water charges.

FT  01 APR 93 / National Power to close two stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the electricity generating company, is to close two power
stations with the loss of 400 jobs, Michael Smith writes.
The company expects to handle staff losses at the stations in West Thurrock,
Essex, and Padiham, Lancashire, through voluntary severance and natural
wastage.
The National Grid, which runs the electricity system in England and Wales,
yesterday signed an eight-year deal with Electricite de France, the French
power company, to allow the 2,000MW cross-channel link to be used for both
imports and exports.
Industrial consumers of electricity in Northern Ireland are to pay up to 9
per cent more from today, it was announced yesterday. The move is in spite
of a government promise last week of at least Pounds 10m to curb rises.
The increases come at a time when electricity companies in England and Wales
are freezing or reducing prices. Mr Nigel Smith, local director of the
Confederation of British Industry, said it was very worrying.

FT  01 APR 93 / Newspaper's air trip offer probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Advertising Standards Authority is investigating the Sunday Times's
offer of free air miles to its readers after the authority received
complaints alleging that the terms of the promotion were misleading and
contained unreasonable restrictions.
The authority said it had received 21 complaints from the public about two
Sunday Times schemes since they were launched on February 21. That compares
with only 14 complaints about Hoover's much-criticised offer of free flights
to purchasers of its domestic appliances.
The Sunday Times campaign promises '500 instant air miles for every reader'.
Under one scheme readers are invited to collect vouchers worth 500 miles
every week over a three-month period and send them in for redemption.
The authority said readers had complained that the Sunday Times did not make
it sufficiently clear that the air miles concerned could be used only
towards the purchase of tickets to destinations specified by the newspaper.
Among the destinations were Jeddah, Tehran and Abu Dhabi, which readers had
pointed out were unlikely choices for a holiday.
The Sunday Times confirmed that it had received a letter from the authority
about its investigation, but had no comment until the outcome was known.

THE SCOPE for companies to create provisions in their balance sheets against

proposals issued by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday.
The board recommends that provisions for future losses and reorganisation
costs after an acquisition will no longer be allowed to be treated as
liabilities in the acquired business on the balance sheet of the purchaser's
accounts.
The purchaser will instead be required to pass these costs through the
profit and loss account as they are incurred, showing them as exceptional
items if they are large enough.
The proposals could be converted into a draft standard by the end of this
year and be mandatory some time next year. Comments are invited by June 14.
The proposals are likely to provoke considerable opposition because they
will greatly reduce the flexibility in financial reporting currently
available to conglomerates and other companies which make acquisitions.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'Acquisition accounting is
the biggest scam in British financial reporting. We expect a lot of flak for
these ideas.'
Traditionally companies have been able to purchase a business and write down
large amounts in their balance sheets. They are then able to release the
provisions over a number of years to boost profits artificially.
This has long been outlawed in the US, but was sanctioned by SSAP 22, the
existing accounting standard on goodwill which was revised as recently as
1989.
In representations to the board companies have claimed that the proposals
would reduce their scope to be prudent by making provisions in advance.
Mr Tweedie said: 'It might look prudent in the balance sheet but it creates
a mulch over the accounts and it becomes unclear where profits are coming
from.'
To prevent companies evading the new regulations the board proposes
'anti-avoidance' measures which would generally forbid provisions made by a
business within six months of it being purchased from being shown in the
balance sheet of the acquirer.
In general, the board says, the fair values of assets and liabilities
acquired should be based on those which existed at the time of acquisition
and not anticipate any changes in the activities of either the purchaser or
the purchased company. The discussion document draws heavily on the board's
statement of principles, which says that liabilities must be strictly
obligations of a company to pay out in the future. Many acquisition
provisions would be excluded under this definition.

FT  01 APR 93 / Training aspirations are wide of the mark: More effort is
needed to ensure targets are met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBITIOUS new national targets aimed at transforming the skills of the
workforce by the turn of the century will not be met in full on present
performance, according to the first annual report of a new government
advisory council.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of the National Advisory Council for Education and
Training Targets, which was set up last month to monitor the targets, said
the rate of take-up of the qualifications had to increase in order to meet
the tar-gets.
Mr Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier, said: 'These are not world-class
targets. They are the minimum that have to be gained and they can only be
achieved through effort at national and local level.'
One of the targets is for 80 per cent of young people to reach National
Vocational Qualification level two, or its academic equivalent of four
GCSEs, by 1997. At present 55.1 per cent of young people have reached this,
an increase of 3.7 percentage points since 1991. However, an annual rate of
increase of 5 percentage points is required to meet the target.
Ministers attending yesterday's formal launch of the advisory council
appeared to be willing to take more responsibility for delivery of the
targets, a development it is understood the Treasury opposes.
The targets, set by the Confederation of British Industry, have in the past
only been endorsed by government. By taking greater responsibility for
meeting the targets, the Treasury fears it may have to put more money into
education to achieve the goals.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said that in future all submissions
to his department on new initiatives would be required to demonstrate the
contribution they would make to the achievement of the targets.
The council, made up of top executives and senior teachers, will report both
to Mr Patten and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary. It will
also make an annual report which will be publicly available. Mr Davis
stressed the body's independence and the desire of its members not to be a
'talking shop'.
A key task, Mr Davis said, was for the council to bring some rigour to the
monitoring of NVQs. He said: 'Our credibility depends on accurate reporting
and monitoring of the targets and making sure they are properly defined.'
Critics have said that some targets are not measurable while, others are
open to interpretation. One target aims for 50 per cent of medium-sized to
large organisations to qualify for Investors in People, a government award
which recognises good practice in training and career development.
However, as the target is now worded, a company achieving the standard in
many of its divisions could qualify for one or several awards, depending on
how many company divisions there are. Unilever, for example, could receive
as many as 30 awards.
There are also criticisms of the methodologies used to establish target
baselines. The targets for adults do not include attainments by the
unemployed, and this could cast doubt on the overall results obtained.
The council will also not have any information on how many people are
working towards NVQs. There is no mechanism at present to record this.

FT  01 APR 93 / Royal Opera seeks talks over site blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Opera House management is seeking an urgent meeting with
Westminster City Council following rejection of part of the Pounds 150m
development plans for the Covent Garden site.
The council's planning committee voted unanimously against allowing the
second phase of the four-stage development - a seven-storey building to
include shops and a home for the Royal Ballet - to proceed without an
assurance that sufficient funds were available to complete the project.
Without the assurance, the committee will insist that the second phase be
redesigned. The committee ruled that the proposed design of the new building
would be acceptable if it formed part of the complete redevelopment approved
in 1990, but that as an isolated building it would not fit in well with its
surroundings.
The slump in the property market has left the opera house with a shortfall
in development funds, and the planning decision is a further blow.
Officials, however, were not too downcast. They believe Pounds 60m of the
Pounds 150m total will come from commercial development of the site, with
the remaining Pounds 90m from public and private sources.

FT  01 APR 93 / Rail strike to go ahead at midnight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL travellers were warned yesterday by British Rail to finish their
journeys by 10 o'clock tonight or risk being stranded.
Last-minute talks between BR management and union negotiators failed to
avert a 24-hour national rail strike which is due to start at midnight.
Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union are protesting about
threatened compulsory redundancies and the use of outside contractors.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR group personnel director, said after the talks: 'They
asked me to give a guarantee of jobs for life in the railway which I
obviously couldn't give. They're asking for something no employee in the
land has got.'
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the union regretted BR 'were
unable to see their way to meet what we thought were reasonable demands'.
In London, many buses will be off the roads in a separate dispute over cuts
in pay for employees.
Mr Steven Norris, London transport minister, last night warned commuters
that parking restrictions would be 'vigorously enforced' along main routes,
and announced a string of measures to cope with the expected influx of cars
during the rail strike.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Gordon, chief executive of The Economist, is to be the next chief
executive of Independent Television News. He succeeds Mr Bob Phillis, who
left yesterday to become deputy director-general of the BBC.
Mr Gordon, a 51-year-old chartered accountant, yesterday confirmed that he
had accepted the job.
Mr Gordon, who has worked for The Economist for 25 years, was chosen by Mr
Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, who is about to be
appointed chairman of ITN, the television news organisation which supplies
news to ITV and Channel 4.
Yesterday the offer for ITN put together by a consortium led by Mr Green
went unconditional in all respects.
Carlton, Central, London Weekend Television, Granada and Reuters, the
international news and information organisation, will dominate ITN, with 18
per cent each. Scottish and Anglia Television each have a 5 per cent stake.
The new shareholders have already reached agreement in principle to buy
ITN's London headquarters from Stanhope Properties in a deal worth Pounds
74m. The deal will relieve financial pressures on ITN.

FT  01 APR 93 / BAe says it needs airfield approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has given way over its controversial plans to develop its
airfield at Filton, north Bristol, as a commercial airport and conceded it
should seek planning permission for change of use.
A fledgling airline, Air Bristol, had hoped to fly scheduled services from
Filton to European cities from late spring. Yesterday's agreement with
Northavon district council, which disputed BAe's claim not to need consent,
will mean a delay of several months even if the company's application is
successful. It could be much longer if the scheme goes to a public inquiry.
BAe, by claiming it did not need fresh planning consent, antagonised many
residents in the area, where more than 4,000 homes have been built in the
last few years in the new town of Bradley Stoke.
MANCHESTER Airport yesterday picked the site for its second runway, opting
for a line parallel and to the south of its existing runway, but beginning
half-way along and intruding into the Cheshire green belt. The runway would
enable the airport to expand to 30m passengers a year from its present level
of about 13m.

FT  01 APR 93 / Newspaper's free flights offer probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Advertising Standards Authority has begun an investigation into the
Sunday Times's offer of free air miles to its readers after receiving
complaints alleging that the terms of the promotion were misleading and
contained unreasonable restrictions.
The authority said it had received 21 complaints from the public about two
Sunday Times schemes since they were launched on February 21. That compares
with only 14 complaints about Hoover's much-criticised offer of free flights
to purchasers of its domestic appliances.
The Sunday Times campaign promises '500 instant air miles for every reader'.
Under one scheme readers are invited to collect vouchers worth 500 miles
every week over a three-month period and send them in for redemption.
The authority said readers had complained that the Sunday Times did not make
sufficiently clear that the air miles concerned could be used only towards
the purchase of tickets to destinations specified by the newspaper.
Among the destinations were Jeddah, Tehran and Abu Dhabi, which readers had
pointed out were unlikely choices for a holiday. Though some more popular
destinations, such as Melbourne and Hong Kong, were also included, the
authority said it could be difficult to collect enough air miles to cover
the full fares in the three months allowed.
The authority said it had also received complaints about a second scheme,
under which readers collect weekly vouchers worth 10 air miles which they
can use to buy a ticket to a destination of their choice.
The authority said it was investigating whether the Sunday Times had made
sufficiently clear that the offer was valid only if all the vouchers were
collected over a 12-month period and put in special booklets.
The Sunday Times confirmed that it had received a letter from the authority
about its investigation, but had no comment until the outcome was known. The
newspaper said it had received 'a handful' of complaints about the schemes.
The investigation is being made under a voluntary code on sales promotions
set up by the advertising industry.

VALUE added tax imposes the most resented tax burden on small businesses,
according to research for Barclays Bank.
The burden of VAT lies not so much in its financial cost but in its impact
on a business's cashflow and time taken in administration, the research
showed. Sixty per cent of the 200 small businesses surveyed said VAT was the
main cause of cashflow management problems, while 62 per cent said it
required more administration than any other tax.

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL consumers of electricity in Northern Ireland are to pay up to 9
per cent more from today, it was announced yesterday, Michael Smith writes.
The move is in spite of a government promise last week of at least Pounds
10m to curb rises.
The increases come at a time when electricity companies in England and Wales
are freezing or reducing prices. Domestic customers of Northern Ireland
Electricity will have to pay 2.3 per cent more or 6 per cent if they use
off-peak Economy Seven.
Mr Nigel Smith, local director of the Confederation of British Industry,
said it was very worrying.
Northern Ireland Electricity, which is to be privatised in the summer, said
electricity in the province was on a different system to that in England and
Wales. More than 80 per cent of electricity was generated from oil in
Northern Ireland and the benefits of cheaper coal, which English and Welsh
consumers were enjoying, were less.

FT  01 APR 93 / London drivers may face road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDONERS could be charged for driving in the capital on a pay-as-you-go
basis by the end of the decade, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said
yesterday.
The aim would be to tackle congestion by making people think twice before
taking cars on the roads at busy times.
The most likely system would require drivers to fit their cars with
electronic meters at their own expense. The meters would clock up charges by
communicating with roadside beacons.
Drivers would pay by inserting rechargeable 'smart cards' into their meters
at the beginning of each journey and the meters would deduct payments from
the cards as journeys progressed.
Drivers penetrating the charging zone without a functioning meter, or an
equivalent device for visitors, would have their licence plates photographed
and face punishment.
The controversial plans emerged as the Department of Transport published the
results of a study of road pricing technology by the University of Newcastle
upon Tyne.
Mr MacGregor said: 'We have to consider new ways of preventing road
congestion in London from getting worse as car ownership grows. Charging
drivers for using the capital's crowded roads is one possible solution.'
No decisions would be taken until a three-year investigation into the
options for road pricing in London had been concluded by the Department of
Transport next year.
The report says that although there is not yet a suitable road pricing
system for the capital, the technology is moving fast. It concludes the
political obstacles are likely to prove greater than the technological ones.

FT  01 APR 93 / Hoover agents lifted Abta bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO travel agents handling Hoover's free flights offer increased their
Association of British Travel Agents bonding at the turn of the year to
enable them to boost sales of associated services such as accommodation and
car hire.
Free Flights Europe of Watford and Your Leisure of Warwick are members of
Abta, which sets bonding levels to ensure that customers' money can be
refunded if the company collapses.
The free flights are not guaranteed by Abta because potential holidaymakers'
contracts are with Hoover. However, Abta would be responsible for services
such as accommodation bought directly from the travel agents.
Mr William Brenchley, managing director of Brevis Marketing Services, Free
Flights Europe's parent company, said he arranged a new bond to cover
additional business generated by the Hoover offer after discussions with
Abta. Mr Michael Dunkley, a director of Your Leisure, said his company also
increased its bond.
Mr Brenchley said he would investigate any specific allegations that his
company gave preference to Hoover applicants who agreed to spend money on
extra services such as accommodation, car hire and insurance. Mr Brenchley
said if such incidents did occur, 'it was not the result of management
instructions'.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: R-R goes on attack over air subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine group, yesterday called for the extension of
last year's EC-US agreement on civil aircraft subsidies to cover aircraft
engines.
His call coincided with the start of talks in Brussels yesterday between US
and EC trade negotiators to review their recent agreement.
Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce chairman, claimed that US aero-engine
manufacturers received more than Dollars 700m (Pounds 492m) a year in
financial support from the US government. Rolls-Royce received just Pounds
15m a year for research from the UK Department of Trade and Industry and the
Ministry of Defence, he said.
'There is no doubt that the level of US government support to its industry
makes life very difficult for us,' Sir Ralph told a House of Commons
committee reviewing the UK aerospace industry.
Rolls Royce had received Pounds 494.2m in UK government launch aid for civil
aircraft programmes since 1972, he said, but it was repaying about Pounds
30m a year to the Treasury. Between now and 2001, the company is expected to
repay nearly Pounds 500m to government.
The turmoil in the civil aviation industry has revived transatlantic trade
tensions over direct government support for the European Airbus programme.
But the EC has in turn accused the US of continuing to support its civil
aerospace industry with indirect subsidies through state agencies.
The dispute has focused on the airframe industry.
Rolls-Royce is now seeking to extend the agreement to cover engines. It said
civil aircraft engines had so far been excluded from the pact because of
opposition from General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US.
Sir Ralph urged the UK government to provide greater research and
development support for the UK aerospace industry, especially in the field
of advanced materials.
'A new family of materials is coming to revolutionise aviation and its first
application will be on engines.' Unless Rolls-Royce remained in the
forefront of new materials technology, it risked losing out, he warned.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: Washington report raises anxiety levels
abroad

THE US yesterday released its eighth annual foreign trade barrier report, a
grievance list which features prominently Japan and the EC and sets the
agenda for US trade actions in the coming year.
Mr Ira Shapiro of the US Trade Representative's office said the report was
part of the process of market opening, now the foundation of US trade
policy.
American officials, he stressed, negotiate to reduce trade barriers on a
most favoured nation basis so that markets are opened to all members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The report is greeted with anxiety in many foreign capitals, where the US
often is seen as throwing its weight around by negotiating bilaterally.
Mr Shapiro said many US complaints could be resolved by completion of the
Uruguay Round, where the US hopes for 'significant progress by summer,' but
he pledged a new emphasis on bilateral efforts.
'In the last Administration bilateral efforts were often given short
shrift,' he said, indicating that this would no longer be the case.
Japan, not surprisingly, came in for the most attention, with complaints
ranging from taxes on alcohol, shipbuilding and aerospace subsidies, and
restrictive business practices in the soda ash market and structural
restrictions on direct investment.
'The regulatory environment of the Japanese insurance industry emphasises
stability and company solvency at the expense of competition,' the report
says. Foreign market access is also blocked by the distribution system,
which does not permit insurance brokers. Restrictions also existed in
securities, accounting and banking.
The EC threw up the usual suspects: variable levies in agriculture; market
access for wine, whiskey and telecommunications; and 'buy national'
government procurement policies.
The US trade surplus with the EC last year dropped from Dollars 16.9bn to
Dollars 8.8bn.
A new 'area of contention' in the Airbus section concerns the financing of
aircraft and engines by government export credit agencies into the home
markets of aircraft producing countries.

BANGKOK has awarded its first contract for sewage treatment and waste water
to North West Water, the privatised UK water utility.
The Pounds 160m contract, which covers design, construction and one year's
operation of the facilities, is still subject to final ratification by the
Thai government.
The company said it hoped for clearance soon and construction was due to
start in July.
The project includes installation of about 50km of sewers and a new sewage
treatment plant. It will serve 700,000 of Bangkok's 10m people.

FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: The gospel according to trade's agnostic -
The emerging views of US negotiator Kantor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICKEY Kantor, the US trade representative, does not like 'theological
debate'. Over two days of talks in Brussels with EC trade officials, he made
this repeatedly clear.
As others grope to discern a clear US trade policy, he insists instead that
the administration is 'pragmatic', 'realistic' and 'results-oriented'.
In Brussels he went further: 'We see a trade policy emerging that is more
active, anticipatory, inclusive and flexible - incorporating new concerns
about the environment, competition policy, international labour standards,
science and technology policy, enlarging the productive capabilities of
developing countries.'
He talked about 'mutuality of obligation and comparability of action'. In
negotiations with the EC, his starting premise was simple: the US is one of
the most open markets in the world. The EC is by comparison closed. The US
task is to get other countries into line.
When asked if the trade policies of President Bill Clinton will be different
from those of his predecessors, Mr Kantor chose 'to reframe the question':
'Can we afford to have continuity for continuity's sake? Can we afford to
remain at a standstill, to live with old assumptions in the face of massive
and inexorable change in the new global economic environment?'
In the wake of these explanations, one Brussels-based trade analyst
commented: 'If Mr Kantor is averse to theological debate, he seems perfectly
happy to deal in metaphysics.'
In certain respects, it remains premature for Mr Kantor to talk more
clearly. The review of US trade policy demanded by Mr Clinton is still
incomplete. The president has still to confirm many of his trade
representatives. Many of those named are new to the area of trade.
Serious negotiation of issues involved with the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks remains impossible because Mr Clinton has yet to put to Congress
proposals renewing 'fast track' laws that would enable the administration to
present a 'take-it-or-leave-it' package.
So far, there are few results by which to measure US policy. Clashes between
the US and the EC over steel dumping, and Airbus subsidies were inherited
from the Bush administration.
'Get tough' threats in a row over EC procurement policy have yet to move
beyond bluff and brinkmanship. Deadlines for US sanctions have come and
gone. A meeting in Washington on April 19-20 is now set as a make-or-break
session, during which there will either be a settlement, or both sides will
be 'free to act as we wish'.
EC officials fear a crisis has been delayed rather than averted. They say
they would be prepared to bow to US demands to dismantle Article 29 of the
new Utilities directive, which discriminates in favour of EC bidders for
procurement contracts, but want the US in return to tackle its 'Buy America'
laws.
Throughout negotiations in Brussels on government procurement, Mr Kantor
neither bowed to, nor agreed to recognise, EC complaints that the 'Buy
America' act in the US strongly discriminates against foreign bidders for
contracts, in particular at a state and municipal level.
On Monday, Mr Kantor said categorically that the act 'has had no effect on
European suppliers'. His claim was embarrassingly contradicted by US
officials at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva,
who at the very time he was speaking were vetoing for the second time a Gatt
panel ruling against the US for having barred a German company from a US
procurement contract through use of the law.
Trade experts also query Mr Clinton's commitment to multilateral trade rules
and 'honest-broker' settlement of trade disputes in the Gatt. In talks with
Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement, with the EC on Airbus,
steel, or procurement, or with Japan on semi-conductors, the US has shown a
clear preference for bilateral settlement of disputes.
President Clinton has also openly supported reinstatement of 'Super 301'
laws, which will entitle the US to target countries it sees as trading
unfairly, and impose sanctions if they do not change their ways.
The US has clearly targeted Japan as an unfair trader, with whom bilateral
negotiations offer the only route to opening the market. In Brussels, Mr
Kantor said the Uruguay Round would not be completed 'if Japan continues to
behave as if it had little stake in the outcome.'
The comment stirred a storm among Japanese trade officials. In Brussels, the
Japanese embassy said Mr Kantor 'had a misperception': 'Maybe he is not yet
fully familiar with the details of the realities.'
That Mr Kantor is new to his task is undeniable. But he is not new to the
domestic economic priorities that lie at the heart of the new president's
decision-making. What the Japanese may be seeing is evidence of new
priorities, in which the details of past realities count for much less.
One UK-based trade analyst commented: 'The US knows what it wants - it's
just not what other people think it should want.'

FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: US fury over piracy by Taiwanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COALITION of leading trade associations in Washington is demanding
sanctions against Taiwan unless it shows 'with specific actions' its
intention to control its 'staggering levels of piracy' of copyrighted works,
videos, compact discs and computer software.
The International Intellectual Property Alliance, which represents more than
1,500 companies, claims US copyright industries lost a total of Dollars 669m
in Taiwan last year through piracy.
Mr Fritz Attaway, a senior vice-president of the Motion Picture Association
of America, accused Taiwan of lacking 'the political will' to enforce an
anti-piracy pact, signed with the US last June.
If sanctions were imposed on Taiwan, they would fall under the Special 301
section of the 1988 Trade law, which requires the US trade representative to
compile an annual list of countries which allow the highest levels of piracy
and designate them as 'priority foreign countries'. He then has 6-9 months
to negotiate agreements before retaliating.
This year's list is due to be published on April 30. Senator Max Baucus,
chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, said Thailand, along with Taiwan,
was a candidate for the 'priority' list.
Bangkok pirates had been 'one of the most egregious offenders'. Now they
were 'scrambling up the technological boarding ladders to raid new
industries and plunder new products'.

FT  01 APR 93 / US indicators point to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US ECONOMIC indicators continue to point to a steady recovery, although
government officials remain concerned that businesses are showing little
inclination to hire workers to meet with expanding demand.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders rose by 1.4
per cent in February, erasing a drop in January. The rise to a record
seasonally adjusted Dollars 258.6bn stemmed largely from a 10.8 per cent
jump in orders in the transport sector.
At the same time, the department's index of leading economic indicators - a
composite formed by combining statistics such as unemployment, orders,
prices and share prices - rose by 0.5 per cent in February.
Economists said the figures were consistent with economic growth of 3-3.5
per cent for the full year and suggested the current recovery was likely to
be sustained at least past the middle of the year.
Some analysts expect a stronger rate of growth in the second half of the
year, as lower interest rates encourage housebuilding.
Manufacturers' shipments rose by 1.6 per cent to Dollars 257.2bn in
February, again offsetting a decline in January, and although inventories
rose for the first time in six months, the backlog of unfilled orders
increased by 0.3 per cent to Dollars 476.2bn.
The index of leading indicators, which was flat in January after a 1.7 per
cent increase in December, climbed in February principally because of the
increase in unfilled orders, coupled with higher orders for plant and
equipment and lower unemployment claims.
Signals about the economy have been mixed, however, with only six of the 11
statistics that make up the composite index pointing to growth, and four
pointing to contraction in February.
One of these four negative indicators in February was consumer confidence,
and the Conference Board reported earlier this week that its index of
consumer confidence continued to slide in March.
Economists believe confidence is unlikely to rise until job creation gets
under way, stilling anxieties about the employment market.

FT  01 APR 93 / Budget package close to being passed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's budget package headed yesterday for final passage
after the House and the Senate agreed to reconcile their different versions
of the bill.
This paved the way for voting on the broad framework of Mr Clinton's budget
proposals before Congress breaks up this weekend for the Easter recess.
However, some members of Congress said the budget could unravel in the
summer when a more detailed bill will be drawn up, because of President
Clinton's controversial decision to remove a provision to end government
subsidies to ranchers and mining companies in the West.
This followed pressure on the White House by western senators who lobbied
against a planned increase in fees for the exploitation of federal lands in
the west to something approaching market levels.
The plan would have raised fees charged to ranchers who graze their cattle
on federal lands, and charged royalties from companies for minerals
extracted from government lands.
Administration officials say the fees and royalties will still be imposed in
a separate initiative, but some congressmen were furious at the climbdown,
and said the move would encourage other lobbyists to pick away at the bill.
'This is a fundamental mistake by the administration,' said Congressman
George Miller, chairman of the House of Representatives Natural Resources
committee.
Congressional aides say the climbdown contradicts Mr Clinton's plea to
members of congress to take his plan as a whole.
The detailed budget reconciliation bill, which will flesh out the budget
resolution bill, in the summer, was always expected to be a hard fight, as
Congress's enthusiasm for deficit reduction came face to face with the
realities of cutting individual, favourite programmes.
The success of the western senators may mean members are less willing to
submerge their local concerns.

FT  01 APR 93 / White House landing lights for airlines: Hopes of help to
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US's leading airlines, after losing more than Dollars 10bn between them
over the last three years, are happy that they have a new administration
more inclined to lend a sympathetic ear to their concerns.
Congress has agreed, with backing from Mr Federico Pena, the transportation
secretary, to set up a 15-member commission to report within 90 days on ways
of alleviating the crisis.
'The industry is relieved that policy makers finally realise that the US
airline industry is in serious financial crisis,' said Mr James Landry,
president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers.
After seeing four sizeable airlines go out of business in the space of three
years (PanAm, Eastern, Midway and Braniff) and with debt ratings for all the
national carriers now at 'junk bond' levels, the nature of the problem is
clear enough, but its causes, and even more its solutions, are much debated.
The recession, which has curtailed spending on leisure and business travel,
has been an important factor, as have savage price wars.
The leading carriers also contend that the US bankruptcy system, which has
allowed financially-weaker carriers to seek protection from their creditors
and continue flying while restructuring their finances, is another.
But the General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of Congress,
questions the impact of bankrupt airlines on pricing structures, noting that
they are not always the ones who start the fare wars.
Mr Norman Mineta, chairman of the House of Representatives committee on
public works and transportation, has warned the airlines not to expect too
much on this front: even if the bankruptcy code were at fault, an overhaul
in the interests of a single industry is unlikely to make it through
Congress.
Even as they emerge from bankruptcy, frailer carriers such as Continental
and TWA pose new problems to their bigger brethren.
Some of the weaker carriers - TWA, Continental and USAir - have won big wage
concessions from their employees, often in return for an equity interest in
the airline. Employees have little choice but to accept these pay/benefit
cuts - the alternative is probably a lost job.
The process continues: Northwest Airlines is trying to secure a concession
package, worth almost Dollars 900m in operating cost savings over a
three-year period.
The 'big three' carriers - American, Delta, and United - argue that they
have much less leverage for squeezing labour costs and cannot hope to match
these deals.
They also complain about the encroachment of foreign investors. KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines is now tied to Northwest, Air Canada to Continental, British
Airways to USAir. Others, such as Lufthansa, are known to want a US partner.
While the ultimate value of such alliances has yet to be established, there
is little doubt that some domestic traffic will be diverted from other US
carriers, as the US partner feeds into the foreign airline's route network
and vice versa.
But Mr Kenneth Mead, director of transportation issues at the GAO, argues
that, on the contrary, the law limiting foreign ownership of airlines to 25
per cent of the voting stock has weakened the US industry by restricting
access to capital.
Both the airlines and the GAO agree that the restrictions on foreign
ownership provide useful leverage for renegotiating many of the US's
bilateral aviation agreements to give US airlines greater access to foreign
markets.
Mr Pena, too, sees this as a priority. Indeed, he made a new agreement with
the UK an implicit condition for renewal in a year's time of his temporary
approval of British Airways' partnership plans with USAir - with the carrot
in his negotiating strategy a promise that the US will relax the ownership
restriction.
The airlines, however, appear to see the restrictions as more of a stick
than a carrot, and it is by no means clear that Mr Pena can persuade either
the airlines or Congress to let him deliver.
Carriers have not waited for government help. Some - USAir, for instance -
have begun to reduce their domestic route networks, to concentrate on the
more profitable routes, and cut out costly hubs. Others have built up
alternative earning sources, with American Airlines taking the lead in
selling services ranging from investment management to logistics
consultancy.
And they had best beware lest the government's new found interest in their
problems carries a sting.
Some members of Congress feel that if the big three spent more time trying
to emulate profitable Southwest Airlines and less time lobbying against
USAir's link with British Airways, they might fare better.
These congressmen are inclined to focus on barriers to competition in the
aviation industry, such as the exclusive control exerted by some airlines
over individual hub airports, the operation of the computerised reservation
systems that dominate the industry, and the impact of frequent flyer plans.
'Even though most airlines are losing money, not all money losers are equal.
Some still have anti-competitive advantages, most notably in computer
reservations systems,' warns Mr Mineta.
Some of the gloom seems certain to lift, since most of the red ink in 1990
and 1991 was attributable to failing airlines which have gone out of
business or emerged from bankruptcy, while half the losses recorded in 1992
resulted from a new federal accounting standard.
Wall Street analysts, although increasingly optimistic, are divided. Some
suggest that the stronger carriers, such as American and United, could see
modest profits in 1993; others think that a return to after-tax profits is
unlikely this year.
The larger airlines are doing nothing to encourage Wall Street's bulls. They
know that their plight has caught Washington's attention and are keen to
keep up the pressure for federal assistance.

JAMAICA'S People's National party has been returned to power in a landslide
election victory which will also see Mr P J Patterson resume the premiership
he took over from Mr Michael Manley last year.
Mr Patterson, a 58-year-old lawyer, said the government would continue with
economic reforms which include the floating of the island's currency and the
sale of state enterprises.
Provisional results yesterday from Tuesday's poll gave the PNP 50 of the 60
seats contested, with five going to the opposition Jamaica Labour party led
by Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister. Five seats were still to be
declared.
The PNP's margin of victory was larger than expected and surprised even
party officials. A split in the JLP leadership is being partly blamed for
the party's poor showing and there were indications yesterday that Mr Seaga
might stand down.

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday clashed with other members of the International Atomic
Energy Agency's governing board over North Korea's nuclear programme.
At a meeting of the 35 governors in Vienna, China refused to back a motion
referring the dispute over inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities to
the United Nations Security Council. Talks are due to continue today. An
IAEA official said the board could overrule China with a majority vote.
However, Algeria, chairing the meeting, urged consensus.
The meeting was also expected to call on Mr Hans Blix, the agency's director
general, to continue efforts to find a way out of the dispute.
On February 25, the IAEA gave North Korea a month to agree to inspections of
two facilities near its Yongbyon nuclear complex. North Korea announced 15
days later that it was withdrawing from the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which it signed in 1985.
Western governments have been counting on a co-operative attitude from China
in their efforts to persuade North Korea to change its mind. But Beijing has
already made clear it opposes the imposition of Security Council sanctions.
South Korea yesterday continued to urge a cautious response and suggested
that the problem could be resolved through diplomacy.
President Kim Young-sam said he expected talks between the two Koreas could
resume soon following the recent end of the US-South Korean 'Team Spirit'
military exercise that Pyongyang cited as one reason for its rejection of
the treaty.
Meanwhile, the North Korean ambassador to Vienna indicated yesterday there
was room for compromise on inspections. Mr Kim Kwang-sup told South Korea's
state television that Pyongyang is willing to accept 'temporary inspections'
of nuclear facilities by the IAEA.

CRACKS within the Pakistani government widened last night with the
resignation of another minister, the fourth this week, from Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's government.
Mr Haji Gulsher Khan, a senator and minister of state for zakat (Islamic
tax), declared his support for President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in his rift with
the prime minister, and said he would back the president if he sought a
second term in elections later this year.
Mr Khan told a news conference he had resigned because he could not accept
an instruction from Mr Sharif to his ministers not to discuss the
presidential election.
Mr Sharif is trying to curtail the president's powers which allow him to
dissolve parliament and to make senior appointments, such as that of army
chief of staff.
One of the ministers who resigned earlier, Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, minister
for the environment, is the president's son-in-law.
The latest rift is being viewed with concern because Pakistan's two previous
prime ministers sworn in since martial law was lifted in 1985 were both
sacked by presidents before completing their term.
However, Mr Sharif's close aides are confident his position is secure, with
unwavering support from a large number of politicians in his home province
of Punjab.

FT  01 APR 93 / The 'Bibi' factor in Mideast talks: When the crunch comes,
Israel may be under new leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESENT urgency to resume Middle East peace talks should not disguise
the fact that the critical long-term decisions on the fate of the
Palestinians will not be negotiated for at least another three years. By
that time Israel could be under new leadership.
According to the terms of the peace process, launched in Madrid nearly 18
months ago, the current phase of talks - scheduled for Washington on April
20 - aims to produce interim self-government arrangements in the occupied
Arab territories which will last five years. Only at the start of the third
year of that agreement will talks begin on the final status of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
So just as Mr Yitzhak Shamir was replaced as prime minister of Israel last
June by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, when Labour defeated Likud in the election, there
is a strong possibility that a new leader may be in charge when the final
status talks get under way.
The election of Mr Binjamin Netanyahu last week as leader of the opposition
Likud party therefore takes on even greater significance.
A former diplomat and deputy foreign minister, Mr Netanyahu must be the
best-known unknown in Israeli politics.
His skilled television delivery brought him repeatedly into tens of millions
of homes, particularly in the US, as Israel's principal spokesman during the
Gulf war. He was also the main government spokesman during the run-up to and
initial stages of the peace process.
The difference now for Mr Netanyahu, known throughout Israel simply as
'Bibi', is that as leader of the right-wing Likud he will have to shape and
articulate policies that are his own. His opponents, within and outside
Likud, argue that this will prove to be his greatest weakness.
Born a year after Israel achieved statehood and some 25 years after Mr
Rabin, Mr Netanyahu represents a substantial generational change in Israel
and confirmation of a more individual approach to politics. His style is
American, where he spent much of his earlier life, his appeal overtly
personal, and his willingness to address policy details so far minimal.
Those who know him best say that he represents mainstream Likud thinking,
but that he would adopt a rather more hawkish approach to peace negotiations
and prove tougher on combating insurrection by the Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
He is said to be committed to the retention of the West Bank as part of the
biblical land of Israel, but might prove less rigid on the future of Gaza
and the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 war.
The campaign for the Likud leadership provided few additional clues. Mr
Netanyahu, three times married, comfortably rode out the storm he had
created by accusing an unnamed senior member of the party of attempting to
blackmail him over his admitted extra-marital activities.
In the one televised debate between the four candidates, Mr Netanyahu
ignored his contenders, addressed his remarks to the camera and concentrated
on the simple assertion that he was the only man who could return Likud to
office.
On the campaign trail he followed the example of US President Bill Clinton,
travelling throughout the country by bus, and again relying on his personal
rapport with Likud voters to bring him an easy victory, winning more than 52
per cent of the votes cast, 12 percentage points more than needed to avoid a
second round.
No great changes in style are expected in the months ahead. Mr Netanyahu is
again likely to follow the Clinton example of going directly to the voters,
bypassing the senior figures in the party who opposed him, and demonstrating
the breadth of his popular support.
Mr Rabin's failures so far to deliver either the peace or security that he
promised during the general election will be the key targets for attack, and
Mr Netanyahu will certainly be hoping to bring down the government before it
has served out the remaining three years of its mandate.
He will also be bolstered by the knowledge that at the next election the
prime minister will for the first time be directly elected, a factor he
expects to be greatly to his advantage.
It is no surprise that Mr Rabin and the US administration are urging the
Palestinians to press ahead swiftly with peace negotiations, both because
they are likely to secure a better deal with the present government and to
assist Labour build the platform it needs to offset Mr Netanyahu's appeal at
the next general election.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament beats the budget deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese budget for fiscal 1993 was passed last night by parliament,
beating the April 1 starting date for the first time in 22 years and
allowing the government to focus on drafting a new stimulatory package,
writes Robert Thomson.
A 26.4 per cent year-on-year drop in construction orders during February
highlighted the need for the new package, which the ruling Liberal
Democratic party says will be more than the Y10,700bn (Pounds 61.5bn)
package announced last year.
However, the LDP may struggle to get approval for a package of that size
from the Ministry of Finance, which has yet to comment on the spending
proposals. Other ministries and LDP members are preparing shopping lists,
but the recent scandals in the party have weakened its influence at the
ministry.
The construction industry is hoping for a generous package, as private
orders for the 57 leading general contractors in February were down 36.3 per
cent to Y992bn. Public orders slipped 1.6 per cent to Y540.4bn, the Japan
Federation of Construction Contractors said yesterday.
But housing starts in February were 6.3 per cent higher than a year before,
according to the Ministry of Construction, which said the increase could be
a sign that property prices would begin to rise soon. Starts of houses for
rent rose 13.1 per cent and of owner-occupied houses by 5.3 per cent,
although starts of houses for sale were down 3.8 per cent.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council and the
head of an 'economic stimulation task force', said the new package would
stimulate the housing construction market by earmarking funds for the
rebuilding of public housing estates.
He also has plans for airports, aid to the banking industry, assistance for
small business and a new network of train lines.

<TEXT>
FOUR Japanese printing companies were indicted yesterday on charges of
violating an anti-monopoly law by rigging bids for special seal supply
contracts with a government agency, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The indictment, brought by the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office,
follows criminal charges filed against the four in late February by the Fair
Trade Commission, Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog.
The latest indictment suggests the authorities are taking a firmer stand
against activities seen as limiting competition unfairly. It comes amid
indications that Japan's large construction companies routinely donated a
proportion of proceeds from public works contracts to the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, operating in a cosy club-like culture.
Dai Nippon Printing, Japan's largest printing company, Toppan Moore, Hitachi
Information Systems and Kobayashi Kirokushi are charged with illegally
arranging the winners of contracts to supply the social insurance agency
with seals fixed to postcards sent to notify recipients of pension
pay-ments.
The prosecutors claim that by fixing the bids the companies earned about
Y1.59bn (Pounds 9.1m). They are believed to have continued to rig bids
despite an FTC order last April to stop.
Their defiance led the Prosecutor's Office, which has already brought
criminal charges against 10 officials of the four companies directly
involved in the bid rigging, to allege the companies themselves had violated
Article 3 of the anti-monopoly law, which bans practices unfairly limiting
transactions.
Under anti-monopoly rules which came into effect in January the companies
could face fines of up to Y100m, up from the previous maximum of Y5m.

FT  01 APR 93 / MP uproar over guilty verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian parliament was in uproar yesterday over a court verdict in which
Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state and a potential
future prime minister, was found guilty of corrupt electoral practices,
writes Stefan Wagstyl.
Opposition members of both the upper and lower houses demanded Mr Pawar's
resignation and staged walk-outs in response to the ruling Congress (I)
party's refusal to allow a debate on the judgment on Tuesday by the Bombay
High Court.
Mr Pawar, who comes from Bombay, recently returned to the city as chief
minister of Maharashtra after serving as defence minister. He has taken
charge of efforts to rebuild confidence in Bombay following recent
inter-religious riots and terrorist bombings.
The judgment concerned a contest held in the parliamentary constituency of
South Ahmdnagar in Maharashtra during the 1991 general election.
The election was won by a Congress (I) party candidate strongly supported by
Mr Pawar.
But Mr Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil, the losing candidate from the left-wing Janata
Dal party, appealed against the poll result, alleging malpractice. The court
upheld his appeal, finding that Mr Pawar and the successful Congress (I)
candidate had defamed Mr Vikhe-Patil by wrongly alleging in speeches that he
had tried to bribe voters with money, gifts and alcohol.
Congress (I) is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the appeal fails,
the election result will be set aside and a new poll held.

FT  01 APR 93 / Farmers reap benefit of Indian reform: Agricultural exports
will be encouraged as New Delhi slackens reins on sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN farmers are to be encouraged to export mainstream agricultural
products, in the most significant liberalisation of the country's farm trade
policy since independence.
The policy, announced yesterday, will extend to farmers the wide-ranging
economic reform programme launched in mid-1991 by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister.
The reforms will undermine a central element of post-independence
agricultural policy - the principle of restraining exports to keep down
domestic food prices and reduce the risk of famine. The measures acknowledge
that the old system, with its panoply of price controls and subsidies, has
contributed to the stagnation of agriculture in many districts and deprived
India of a potentially huge source of export earnings.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, said in a statement that
promoting agricultural exports was essential for boosting investment in
agriculture, raising incomes in rural areas and ensuring that the benefits
of export-led growth reached the country as a whole. The government is
concerned that export growth has flagged recently. However, it risks
political opposition over the changes since the reforms might lead to higher
domestic food prices.
Much will depend on the extent to which the government continues to pay out
food price subsidies. There might also be friction in rural areas between
rich farmers, who can afford to invest to take advantage of export
opportunities, and poorer ones.
Under past policies, agricultural exports have been dominated by
internationally traded commodity crops including tea, coffee, high-grade
rice, nuts and spices. Exports of staple crops have either been restricted
or banned outright.
Fruits and vegetables accounted for just Dollars 142m (Pounds 100m) of total
agricultural exports of Dollars 3.3bn in the year to March 1992. Processed
foods totalled only Dollars 77m.
Under the new policy, businessmen will be free to set up export-oriented
units in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, poultry, and
fish-farming. They will be allowed to import capital equipment and materials
duty free - in the same way that industrial export-oriented units already
can.
In an extra concession, such units will be allowed to sell up to 50 per cent
of their output in the domestic market, compared with a 25 per cent limit
for industry.
The immediate impact on exports will be slight as such units could take time
to establish themselves. But the potential effects are great since fertile
parts of India, such as the northern state of Punjab, could well become
internationally competitive exporters.
In other measures announced yesterday, the government permitted accountants,
lawyers, journalists and other professionals to import capital equipment at
a concessional duty rate of 15 per cent.
Mr Mukherjee said in his statement that India's 'abundance of highly skilled
human resources' gave it a competitive advantage in services.
The minister also took a further 144 items off the list of banned imports.
The newly decontrolled products include poultry feed and other goods of
interest to farmers.

FT  01 APR 93 / Japan's banks sell Y682bn of bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese banks said yesterday they had sold Y681.7bn (Pounds 3.9bn)
of their bad property loans in recent weeks to a new agency, which purchased
them at a generous 66 per cent of face value.
At the same time the leading 21 banks are believed to have successfully
hurdled the 8 per cent target set for capital adequacy ratios for the fiscal
year which ended yesterday. About eight of the largest 11 commercial banks
are believed to have capital to assets ratios at a comfortable 9 per cent.
The loan purchases, announced through the Bank of Japan, were by the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, an industry body established earlier
this year to try to clear away the large pile of non-performing
property-related loans.
Banks bring their bad loans to the CCPC, which values the property and other
collateral and buys the loan credit, allowing insititutions to write off the
difference, at a favourable tax rate. It is hoped the company will help to
put a floor under property prices through its valuations.
The CCPC said that the loan credits bought in recent weeks came from 35
banks and life assurers. The banks have to provide the money for the CCPC to
buy the loans, and remain responsible for selling the property, even though
they have theoretically sold the collateral to the company.
Before the CCPC began valuing the collateral there were concerns that the
property valuations could be overly generous, undermining the potential role
as a guide to prospective land pruchasers. The 66 per cent figure suggests
that banks either brought in their most attractive bad loans or that the
valuations were generous.
The leading 21 banks were officially estimated to have non-performing loans
of Y12,300bn at the end of last September. But that figure is regarded as an
underestimate as it does not include affiliates' bad loans or the increasing
amount of loans on which token repayments are made to ensure they are not
officially 'bad'.
But the banks will be relieved that their capital adequacy ratios, as
defined by the Bank for International Settlements, are relatively healthy.
They have been helped by the surge in Tokyo stock prices in recent weeks,
and the strengthening yen.

MANAGERS from two South Korean construction companies were arrested
yesterday after they were accused of causing the nation's worst rail
accident, which killed 78 persons on Sunday.
An express train crashed on the outskirts of Pusan, South Korea's second
largest city, as nearby underground tunnelling work allegedly caused the
rail bed to collapse.
The tunnelling activity was connected with electric cable laying for Korean
Electric Power (Kepco), the state-run electricity monopoly.
Kepco had awarded the project to Samsung Construction but the tunnelling
contract was subcontracted out to Pusan-based Hanjin Construction Industry,
which is not affiliated with the Hanjin business group, the country's sixth
biggest conglomerate.
Blasting, including one explosion five minutes before the accident, is
believed to have weaken the railroad bed, which lies on a sandy strata.
The eight persons arrested by Pusan city prosecutors include the Samsung
supervisor of the construction site and executives from Hanjin.
Prosecutors are also investigating Kepco and the state-run Korean National
Railroad for possible negligence.

FT  01 APR 93 / Rising Indonesian exports fail to outstrip imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S non-oil exports rose 21 per cent to an estimated Dollars 23bn
(Pounds 16.1bn) in the 1992-93 financial year which ended yesterday, but
failed to exceed non-oil imports which climbed 13 per cent to Dollars 27bn.
A report by Lazard Freres, Lehman Brothers and S G Warburg, the government's
foreign banking advisers, estimates Indonesia ran a current account deficit
in 1992-93 of Dollars 3.75bn, down from Dollars 4.35bn a year earlier.
The deficit is forecast to fall further, to Dollars 3.2bn, in the new
financial year. Economists estimate gross domestic product grew about 5.75
per cent in 1992 to Dollars 123bn.
The report provides only partial succour for ministers defending the
government's export-driven economic policy, which has led to a doubling of
non-oil exports since 1988. The government's economic stance has been in
doubt following a recent cabinet reshuffle which saw officials who support
an import substitution policy gain ground.
The government's external debt has continued to rise, despite its avowal to
limit overseas borrowing. Public external debt totalled Dollars 47.8bn at
the end of December, against Dollars 43.6bn at the start of the 1992-93
financial year.
The report says the cost of servicing public external debt rose by 6 per
cent to an estimated Dollars 7.2bn in 1992-93, and is forecast to reach
Dollars 7.5bn in 1993-94. Debt servicing easily outstripped new aid from
international donors, which amounted to Dollars 4.9bn last year.
The report underlined, however, the importance of donor finance which
enabled Indonesia to record a balance of payments surplus estimated at
Dollars 1.5bn in 1992-93, against Dollars 1.2bn a year earlier. This allowed
the central bank to increase foreign reserves which totalled Dollars 11.6bn
at the end of December, up from Dollars 10.5bn at the beginning of fiscal
1992-93.

FT  01 APR 93 / UN halts Bosnia evacuation after nine more die
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations has suspended the evacuation of Moslems from the besieged
Bosnian town of Srebrenica after nine people, seven of them children, were
killed yesterday in the crush to leave.
The latest UN convoy, carrying more than 2,000 women, children and elderly
men, reached the Moslem town of Tuzla after being delayed by soldiers.
Before they left Srebrenica, the trucks were overrun by thousands of Moslems
desperate to get out and two children died in the stampede. Five more
children and two women were later found dead on the overcrowded trucks,
Tuzla officials said.
Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman in Sarajevo for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said: 'We are putting this evacuation on hold until we get
sufficient UN presence on the ground in Srebrenica, so we can have an
evacuation in a dignified and organised manner.'
Ms Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade office of the UNHCR said: 'The level of
panic is at an all-time high. The local community has lost all confidence in
the ability of the United Nations to protect them.' Six Moslems died in a
similar incident on Monday when UN lorries evacuated more than 1,300 people
to Tuzla, a government stronghold about 70 miles to the north-west.
Lieutenant-Colonel Tricia Purves, a British UN officer, said of the chaos:
'This is going to happen every time we send trucks in to evacuate people
because so many are desperate to get out'.
UN convoys to Srebrenica are allowed to take only light military escorts
which lack the resources to maintain order among the refugees.
When asked how many troops would be needed to control those among the 30,000
to 40,000 Moslems still trapped in Srebrenica who want to leave, Col Purves
said: 'I don't think a brigade could control people this desperate.'

Plans by Austria Tabakwerke (ATW), the state-owned tobacco monopoly, to
acquire the Head sports equipment group have met opposition from the
People's Party, the conservative junior partner in the Austrian coalition
government, Eric Frey writes from Vienna.
Mrs Maria Fekter, state secretary in the ministry of economics, said she
feared a market distortion if a monopoly concern used its large profits to
buy a private company.

General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday said his
announcement earlier this week that the withdrawal of Russian troops from
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would be halted was 'a result of the
short-sighted, tough policy of Estonia and Latvia in relation to the
withdrawal process', John Lloyd writes from Moscow.
Gen Grachev, on an official visit to St Petersburg, said that Russia
intended to withdraw the troops in a 'civilised fashion'. But while there
were no agreements on how the cost of the withdrawal was to be borne, and on
social guarantees for the officers, withdrawal could not be completed.

RUSSIA is to sell stakes in two of the country's biggest industrial
enterprises in a nationwide auction tomorrow, Leyla Boulton writes from
Moscow.
Mr Eduard Karlov, a spokesman for the State Property Committee, said
yesterday that 28.5 per cent of Uralmash, an engineering plant, and 60 per
cent of the First Ural New Tube Plant, both based in Yekaterinburg, would be
offered to the public in exchange for privatisation vouchers. This will be
only the second auction in which bids can be accepted around the country,
rather than just in the place where the enterprises for sale are located.
The shares in the two companies will be offered in eight regions, plus
Moscow and St Petersburg.

THE UN Security Council last night gave the go-ahead for Nato warplanes to
patrol Bosnian air space and shoot down any military aircraft violating the
'no-fly' ban.
A resolution, delayed by Russian doubts, authorised enforcement of the
no-fly zone by 14-0, with China abstaining.
The vote came as pressure mounted on the Bosnian Serbs to join the Moslems
and Croatians in signing the peace settlement drawn up by the international
mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, dividing Bosnia into 10
semi-autonomous provinces.
Russia has been concerned to limit the way the no-fly zone is enforced. It
is prepared to sanction shooting down any Serb aircraft violating Bosnian
air space but not attacks on aircraft on the ground.
Mr Yuli Vorontsov, Russia's Security Council representative, stressed the
need to co-ordinate combat operations with the UN in New York.
He reminded Bosnian Serbs if they accepted the Vance-Owen plan the UN
resolution would not have to be implemented. In any event, it will not go
into effect for 14 days.
China's delegate objected to invoking mandatory enforcement provisions of
Chapter VII of the UN Charter and also cited reservations voiced by the UN
field commander.
The Security Council is expected to vote later this week to endorse the
Vance-Owen plan and tighten economic sanctions against Serbia. The US and EC
appeared to have resolved differences over endorsement of the plan, about
which the Clinton administration has had reservations.
Earlier, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told Mr John Major, UK
prime minister, in a letter 'we are now two-thirds of the way to peace'. He
urged Mr Major to support changes in the map of the proposed provinces.

FT  01 APR 93 / Balladur gives his team pro-EC stamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE make-up of his cabinet and his first directions to it yesterday suggest
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is falling in with President Mitterrand's
wishes for a government which shows itself pro-European abroad and concerned
with social issues at home.
The new government's programme will not become clear until Mr Balladur
outlines it to parliament next Thursday. But already, after an informal
meeting with his new team yesterday, Mr Balladur made it known that his
first foreign trip would be to see Chancellor Helmut Kohl after Easter, and
that his new ministers should get cracking on pruning this year's yawning
budget deficit, reducing the level of unemployment that now stands at 3m,
and saving the state pension and welfare systems from bankruptcy.
The key pointer to Mr Balladur's desire for pro-EC government, with its
centre of gravity lying in the moderate centre-right part of the political
spectrum, was his determination to bring Mrs Simone Veil back to domestic
politics. He had no 'party political' reason to do so. Mrs Veil last held
office in France in 1979, when she resigned to become the first president of
the directly-elected European Parliament where she has been since. She
played no real part in the recent election campaign, is a centrist, but no
longer has any close ties to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Union for French
Democracy (UDF) party.
Yet, she has been made the senior of four 'ministers of state' who rank
above ordinary ministers. In protocol terms, this makes her Mr Balladur's
deputy, with a weight beyond her actual responsibility for social, health
and urban affairs. Mr Balladur wanted Mrs Veil, to whom he first offered the
justice ministry, in his team because this 65-year-old Jewish survivor of a
German concentration camp symbolises a rare kind of tough morality in French
politics.
As the author of France's 1974 abortion law, and a dedicated European, she
gives the government both a progressive and a pro-EC flavour for the price
of just one post in a cabinet which Mr Balladur wanted to restrict in
number. If the government were to be pushed off its pro-EC rails, Mrs Veil
would be the first to pull the alarm cord. Mr Balladur, himself the first of
Europe's finance ministers to propose in 1987 setting up a European central
bank, may think that no bad thing.
There are other reasons why the composition of France's new government will
give no comfort to anti-Maastricht Conservatives in Britain, or discomfort
to governments of the 10 countries that have ratified the European union
treaty. The Balladur team contains only two anti-Maastricht ministers - Mr
Charles Pasqua and Mr Francois Fillon - but they are safely parked at the
interior and research ministries, respectively. The maverick Mr Alain
Madelin has free market doubts about fixed exchange rates, but he will have
his hands full setting up the new ministry for small business.
Mainstream responsibility for European policy will fall on other shoulders.
Mr Edmond Alphandery is effectively the country's new finance minister, but
nominally only responsible for the 'economy', with the word 'finance'
excised from his title. This reflects the determination of Mr Balladur,
himself a former finance minister, to exercise a strong role on monetary
policy. A clash is possible. Quite quickly, Mr Alphandery can be expected to
assert himself, particularly on the urgent matter of making the Bank of
France autonomous, an issue on which Mr Alphandery has strong views.
For the moment all the government has on paper about the change in the
central bank's status is a draft statute.
Mr Alain Juppe's appointment as foreign minister gives him a chance to come
out from the long shadow of Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist Republican
Rally (RPR) leader., The odds are that Mr Juppe will take it, and prove
himself more pro-European than his patron.
However, less able to resist the influence of Mr Chirac, who has stayed out
of the government to run for the presidency on a populist, not to say,
protectionist platform, may be the new farm minister, Mr Jean Puech. He is
ostensibly pro-Maastricht, but may well be unable to resist pressure from
the farmers, probably egged on by Mr Chirac, for a confrontation with
Brussels. Mr Puech was not Mr Balladur's first choice. Another UDF centrist,
Mr Charles Millon, refused it three times, saying it would be incompatible
with his pro-EC convictions. Clearly Mr Millon smelt coming trouble.

FT  01 APR 93 / Cars study sees shift in market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales worldwide are forecast to grow by an average 2.4 per cent a
year to the end of the decade, increasing to 40m in 2000 from 33.1m in 1992,
according to a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Much of the growth will come from regions outside the main markets of west
Europe, North America and Japan, which will expand only slowly and at times
go into decline, says the report.
Growth in new car demand will be particularly slow over the next few years
in west Europe and Japan, which are both expected to suffer from shrinking
sales in 1993.
The EIU study forecasts that the highest growth rates will be achieved in
China, with sales rising at nearly 22 per cent a year, in south-east Asia,
where sales will virtually double by the end of the decade, in India and in
South America.
The study is pessimistic about the development of new car demand in east
Europe, where sales are forecast to come under pressure from the erosion of
people's savings and the continuing fall in incomes.
New car demand in east Europe is forecast to continue declining until 1995,
with Hungary and the Czech Republic proving the only exceptions.
The report forecasts that Japanese carmakers will continue to increase their
share of the world market, despite a comparatively poor performance in the
US in 1992. Their share in the US is expected to grow to 32 per cent by 1996
and to 14 per cent in west Europe in the same period.
The Japanese combined share of the two markets is forecast to have grown to
21.6 per cent in 1996 from 16.3 per cent a decade ago.

FT  01 APR 93 / Stable franc reflects optimism

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH short-term interest rates yesterday fell slightly as financial
markets responded positively to the appointment of Mr Edmond Alphandery, a
staunch supporter of the strong currency policy of the franc fort, as
economics minister.
The franc, which has strengthened slightly since the conservatives' victory
in Sunday's parliamentary election, was stable, ending the day unchanged at
FFr3.396 against the D-Mark.
Meanwhile, short-term interest rates, which rose sharply last year in the
Bank of France's efforts to defend the franc, have eased. The cost of
one-month money is now just under 11 per cent, with three-month money at
around 10 per cent. Both rates were about 0.5 of a percentage point higher a
week ago.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, has made it clear that he hopes
to reduce interest rates as quickly as possible to alleviate the pressure on
the French economy.
The appointment of Mr Alphandery, a former economics professor known to be a
strong proponent of European monetary union, has been interpreted by
economists as an indication that the new government will continue the policy
of waiting for German interest rates to fall before reducing French rates.
A question remains on whether German rates will fall far enough.

AT LEAST three people were said to have been trampled to death yesterday in
a desperate surge to crowd on to United Nations lorries leaving Srebrenica,
the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
'We have confirmation of three people dying before the convoy left
Srebrenica . . . We have information about some more deaths en route to
Tuzla,' said Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, special envoy of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
'The level of panic is at an all-time high. The local community has lost all
confidence in the ability of the United Nations to protect them,' said Ms
Lyndall Sachs of the Belgrade office of the UNHCR.
'It was worse than ever before. Absolute hysteria - the people were killed
in the crush. Many of them were already in a weakened condition,' said
another relief official. Six Moslems died in a similar incident on Monday
when UN lorries evacuated more than 1,300 people to Tuzla, the biggest
government stronghold about 70 miles north-west. They risked the arduous
journey to escape the advance of Serb forces on Srebrenica, besieged for
almost one year.
Meanwhile, in Pale, the Serb stronghold outside Sarajevo, Mr Vitaly Churkin,
the special envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, urged Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to endorse the plan of international
mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, which envisages the division of
Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces.
'He did not insist we sign the maps in this form. But that we approve the
Vance plan in general,' said Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the
self-proclaimed Serb state, which covers 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Radio Belgrade said Mr Churkin, the deputy foreign minister of Russia, will
attend a parliamentary session of the Serb state on Friday, when the
deputies will vote on whether to adopt the peace plan.
Mr Koljevic said he believed that the Serb parliament would approve the plan
on the condition of negotiations among all three sides over the maps.

FT  01 APR 93 / Security council split on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENTS between permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council are likely to delay further the adoption of a draft resolution for
tougher sanctions against Serbia - already postponed three times last week.
Both the US and Russia have reservations about different aspects of the
resolution which no one now expects to be adopted before President Clinton
and President Yeltsin meet this weekend.
Russia has said it would vote against the enforcement of a no-fly zone over
Bosnia unless the resolution was modified to exclude attacks on ground
targets, the Russian Interfax news agency reported.
The harder Russian position follows demands by conservative
parliamentarians, who criticise Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberal foreign
minister, for co-operating with western governments in condemning Serb
military action in Bosnia. Russian conservatives have been upset that Moscow
appeared to be abandoning its traditional Serbian allies.
Meanwhile, to the surprise of European members of the Security Council, the
US has objected to including a clear endorsement of the international peace
plan for Bosnia, drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, as part of the
new sanctions resolution.
The draft resolution, backed by Britain, France and Spain, is intended to
persuade Belgrade to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace
plan, which has so far been endorsed only by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems.
According to some reports, the US remains divided about the workability of
the plan and has doubts about its fairness to the Moslems.

<TEXT>
WEST GERMANY'S industrial production could decline by as much as 7 per cent
this year, Ifo, the Munich-based economics institute, reported in a monthly
survey of manufacturers, distributors and building companies.
The report says that plans to reduce investment sharply and cut production
were the principal causes for the expected decline.
Producers sampled by Ifo said they would continue to reduce output, leaving
utilisation of industrial capacity at 80.4 per cent by the end of the year
compared with 85 per cent in the middle of 1992.
The most pronounced fall will be in the motor industry, with output dropping
by 'nearly 20 per cent'. Exports will continue to be negatively affected by
the strong D-Mark and high production costs, the report says.
Production of lorries and delivery vans could also sink, by 14 per cent this
year compared with 6.5 per cent in 1992. Engineering products are set to
fall by 8 per cent in 1993. The chemical sector is also expected to reduce
production by 4 to 5 per cent this year, the report notes.
The textile industry plans to decrease output by 8 per cent while the
clothing industry is expected to fair relatively better than last year, with
production falling by 5 per cent against 12 per cent in 1992.
Only the construction industry will continue to record growth, the report
says. But output for 1993 will grow only 1 per cent, compared with 5.6 per
cent last year. The report blamed the general economic decline for such
lower results. In east Germany, the construction industry will continue to
grow strongly, with output expected to increase by 20 per cent this year.
Meanwhile, Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, board director of Deutsche Bank
responsible for macro-economics, said yesterday that the 'solidarity pact'
recently concluded for the east German economy was only the first step
towards big structural changes in the German economy.
He said the government should tackle three issues as a matter of great
urgency:
It should make 'substantial, rather than marginal' cuts in budget spending
to release funds for investment in eastern Germany;
It should take steps to privatise industry as a way of reducing the DM400bn
(Pounds 169.4bn) debts inherited from the former East Germany. 'Reduction of
these debts. . . is inconceivable without the mobilisation of public sector
assets,' he said.
It should take steps to eliminate the causes of excessive borrowing.

</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has asked the Amato government to
stay on in office - at least until the referendums due on April 18 - in the
absence of early agreement on an alternative.
This is the upshot of an exhaustive series of consultations held throughout
Tuesday by President Scalfaro. The main parties, while unanimous in calling
for a government based on broader support than the current four-party
coalition, are deadlocked on how this should be achieved.
The lira, under strong pressure since the beginning of the week because of
political uncertainties, recovered slightly yesterday. But this appeared to
reflect the market's view that the currency was undervalued at close to
L1,000 to the D-Mark rather than confidence in a satisfactory political
solution.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, is now in the hapless
position of being obliged to soldier on, heading a government whose days are
numbered. One of the main stumbling blocks to finding a broader based
government is the reluctance of the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS) and the Republicans to join forces, albeit for a limited period,
with the ruling parties whom they regard as discredited.
The impermanence of the government was underlined yesterday by Mr Amato's
decision not to fill the finance ministry portfolio. This was left vacant on
Tuesday by the resignation of Mr Franco Reviglio, a Socialist senator,
because of his alleged involvement in the corruption scandals. When Mr
Gianni Fontana resigned as minister of agriculture on March 21 for the same
reason, Mr Amato replaced him to show his determination to keep the
government alive.
Mr Reviglio, the fifth minister to resign because of the corruption
investigations, is alleged to have received illicit funds while chairman of
Eni, the state oil concern, from 1983 to 1989. The gap between what Italy's
political parties said they received in revenue and what they said they
spent quadrupled during 1992 to L27bn (Pounds 11.3m).
According to the parties' balance sheets published yesterday, just a week
after their 1991 accounts, revenues totalled L279.4bn while outgoings were
L306bn. The accumulated deficit of the parties reached L134bn, a 24 per cent
rise during the year. The accounts, prepared in the light of investigations
into illicit party funding, still fail to reflect the true picture.

CONCERN is growing in Brussels that European Community institutions could be
dragged into Italy's spreading corruption scandals, following the suicide of
a senior EC official and the disappearance of a former official.
A senior Italian bureaucrat, formerly in charge of the Community's
tobacco-growing subsidy regime, jumped from a window of the offices of the
Agriculture Directorate in Brussels two days ago, only weeks ahead of an
internal Commission hearing about tobacco fraud. Mr Antonio Quatraro was
moved from his post two years ago after he was implicated by the EC's Court
of Auditors in fraud involving payments to Italian and Greek tobacco growers
and processors for 'phantom' crops.
The suicide comes just after the disappearance of a former senior official
at the European Parliament, and close aide to Mr Bettino Craxi, the Italian
Socialist leader being investigated on multiple charges of corruption in
Italy.
Mr Mauro Giallombardo, secretary general of the confederation of European
socialist parties until 1990 and then on contract as a senior official in
the Parliament secretariat general, dropped out of sight after being forced
to resign in February. The Italian judicial authorities have issued a
warrant for his arrest.
Belgium's authorities are understood to be investigating his possible links
to the Agusta affair, involving kickbacks paid on Belgium's 1988 purchase of
helicopters from the Italian company Agusta. Reports in Italy, Luxembourg
and Belgium allege that two subsidiaries of a company called Merchant
Italia, set up in Luxembourg by Mr Giallombardo, are being examined as
possible conduits for kickbacks.
The European Parliament is holding an inquiry into Mr Giallombardo's
activities, officials confirmed yesterday.
Mr Quatraro was an adviser on international aspects of the EC's common
agricultural policy.
Brussels police said yesterday they were satisfied it was suicide and were
not pursuing inquiries into his death.
There is no firm evidence to link Mr Quatraro with the series of Italian
corruption scandals. But Commission officials said yesterday they were
puzzled that the prospect of a disciplinary hearing should have prompted
suicide, when Mr Quatraro probably could have been quietly retired from the
Brussels executive without facing criminal charges.
Mr Giallombardo, after Italian Socialist pressure, was found a temporary
post in the Parliament's secretariat.
'We were totally unaware at the time of his transfer of the nature of the
activities he is now accused of,' a senior official in the secretariat
general said yesterday. Mr Giallombardo ceased appearing for work from July
1991, the official said. He finally accepted repeated invitations to resign
in January this year, after letters had been sent to his Luxembourg address.
Italy has a reputation for misusing EC funds, but not necessarily of getting
away with it.
The Rome government is due to repay the Community some Ecu2.3bn (Pounds
1.8bn) for illicitly exceeding the milk quota fixed under the Common
Agricultural Policy. Over Ecu3bn of regional funds earmarked for Italy are
being withheld because the European Commission is not satisfied with some of
the programmes Italy has put forward.

FT  01 APR 93 / Bundesbank makes further small cut in the repo rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday eased monetary policy for the first time in the two
weeks since it reduced the key discount rate by half a percentage point to
7.5 per cent.
It made a modest cut in the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to the
country's banking system ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank
policy-making council.
The German central bank cut the securities repurchase - or repo rate - to
8.17 per cent from 8.25 per cent, awakening some speculation that the
Bundesbank could announce further cuts in its 'official' Lombard and
discount rates after today's meeting.
However, analysts were inclined to see the step as part of the Bundesbank's
gradualist approach to easing rates rather than as a harbinger of further,
substantial cuts in the official rates in the short term.
This is the first time the repo rate has been reduced since March 6 when the
repo rate was trimmed from 8.49 per cent. The Bundesbank has recently
repeated its determination to maintain its battle against inflation -
currently 4.3 per cent in western Germany - and to preserve the value of the
D-Mark.
But at the same time the economic situation in Germany is deteriorating
rapidly, making further easing desirable for domestic reasons.
Economists say the policy of gradual easing in the repo rate allows the
Bundesbank to introduce cuts in rates while still maintaining its vigilant
stance against inflation.
Belgium yesterday cut key interest rates and financial markets rallied after
the government agreed a package which will reduce the budget deficit and
haul the country out of a week-old political crisis, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The central bank's central rate was lowered to 8.2 per cent from 8.5 per
cent and its end-of-day rate to 9.2 per cent from 10 per cent.
Its emergency lending rate was lowered to 10 per cent from 12.5 per cent.

FT  01 APR 93 / House arrest for Fiat executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francesco Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, was yesterday allowed
to swap prison for house arrest after being held in Milan's San Vittore jail
since February 22 on charges of corruption and illicit financing of
political parties.
The charges against Mr Mattioli, one of the three most senior executives of
the Turin motor group, refer to illegal payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 750,000)
made during the construction of the Milan metro in which Fiat's construction
arm, Cogefar-Impresit, was involved.
Last week, a civil liberties tribunal refused to release Mr Mattioli from
prison on the grounds he could prejudice investigations by Milan
magistrates.
The court also disclosed allegations of illicit use of overseas accounts by
Fiat subsidiaries, including Cogefar Camerun, in Cameroon.
This decision provoked a furious reaction from Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's
chief executive, who claimed the courts had no idea how a multinational
operated.
But at least one newspaper speculated yesterday that Mr Mattioli had helped
the magistrates with their inquiries after an unexpected three-hour meeting
in San Vittore with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, one of the leading Milan
investigative magistrates.
Milan magistrates are understood to have presented Mr Mattioli with evidence
of funds being passed in 1992 through Banco Unione Commercio of Lugano, 100
per cent owned by Fiat, to accounts held in Switzerland respectively by the
chief treasurers of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties.
Mr Severino Citaristi, who has resigned from his position in the Christian
Democrat party, has received over 20 notices of being under investigation on
various counts of illicit party funding. Mr Vincenzo Balzamo, his Socialist
opposite number, died last autummn of a heart atack after being told he was
under investigation.
Magistrates yesterday questioned Mr Roberto Araldi, a Milan accountant, over
alleged payments by Fiat Avio, the group's aerospace turbines subsidiary, to
board members of Enel, the state electricity authority, for a L400bn gas
turbine contract.

FT  01 APR 93 / Bonn proposes new recycling measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German cabinet yesterday approved a proposed environmental law which
will force industrial producers to ensure the collection and recycling of
waste consumer products.
The law, which will be presented to parliament this year, should come into
effect in about three years and will effectively transfer to the private
sector the costs of collecting and recycling waste now assumed by local
councils.
The Environment Ministry said: 'Our philosophy aims to make industry, and
not the state, pay for recycling consumer products.'
However, consumers may be the first to bear the cost of the recycling.
Industrialists, who have opposed the law fiercely, say it will force
companies to charge higher prices.
'It is time to understand that there simply is a price to be paid for
recycling,' Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister said yesterday.
A similar law for consumer packaging, adopted two years ago, prompted
industrial producers to create a nationwide waste-collecting company, Duales
System Deutschland (DSD).
Consumers have been charged higher prices for products collected by DSD,
which bear a distinctive green dot.
Such a system may also be set up as a result of the new law, with producers
creating a special organisation in charge of collecting consumer products
and ensuring their recycling. Products sold in Germany by foreign companies
could also be collected.
The Environment Ministry hopes industry will ultimately be forced to
manufacture products which can be more easily recycled.
The new law will also restrict industry's opportunity to dump or incinerate
waste.

FT  01 APR 93 / Property package agreed for East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday agreed a compensation package for tens of
thousands of people whose property was confiscated by the Nazis, or the
communist regime in the former east Germany.
The draft bill, which took nearly two years to draw up, will be debated in
the Bundestag, or parliament after the Easter recess. However, it is likely
to be referred to the constitutional court.
Under the bill, those seeking compensation will be paid out of a fund
supervised by the finance ministry. The fund, totalling DM12bn, will be
financed in part by a tax on those who manage to get their property back.
Over 1.1m claims on 2.5m land titles have already been registered. Fewer
than 15 per cent of the claims have been settled.
The delay in agreeing a final draft, and in settling property rights in
general in eastern Germany has held back foreign investment and developers
in the region, even though foreign investors have, under certain conditions,
priority over restitution claims.
Those who property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and between 1949
and 1990, can obtain compensation or claim restitution. No help is allowed
for property expropriated by Soviet forces between 1945 and 1949.

FT  01 APR 93 / Parties reveal L27bn gap in funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gap between what Italy's political parties said they received in revenue
and what they said they spent quadrupled during 1992 to L27bn.
According to the parties' balance sheets published yesterday, just a week
after their 1991 accounts, revenues totalled L279.4bn while outgoings were
L306bn. The accumulated deficit of the parties reached L134bn, a 24 per cent
rise during the year.
The accounts have been prepared in the light of the year-long magistrates'
investigations into illicit party funding but still fail to reflect the true
picture.
The investigations, which have involved more than 70 members of parliament
and forced the leaders of five parties to resign, have shown that for last
April's elections substantial sums were paid on the side - and these went
either to cover party expenses or for personal enrichment.
A comment by the small Radical party attached to their balance sheet reads:
'One should not believe the accounts published by the parties because they
are false.'

FT  01 APR 93 / Major and Thatcher to face Iraq arms inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister, his predecessor Lady Thatcher, and Mr Alan Clark, the
former defence minister, will be asked to give evidence to the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry.
Downing Street said last night Mr John Major would be happy to give evidence
to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry, in public if necessary.
The judge outlined at a London news conference yesterday how he would
conduct his inquiry, which centres on Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based
machine-tool company alleged to have supplied parts for Iraq's so-called
supergun.
Lord Justice Scott said the evidence at the hearings would be heard in
public unless there was 'an overriding national interest reason' why it
should not be.
Three former executives of the company were acquitted at the Old Bailey last
November of illegally trying to export arms-making equipment to Iraq amid
accusations that government ministers encouraged manufacturers to emphasise
the peaceful uses of their products when seeking export licences.
The hearings will start on May 4. The first witness will be Sir Richard
Luce, the former foreign office minister who drew up the original guidelines
governing exports to Iraq in the mid 1980s. The results of the inquiry are
expected to be published towards the end of the year.
Asked if Mr Mark Thatcher, the former prime minister's son, might be invited
to give evidence, Lord Justice Scott said he had seen no connection between
Mr Thatcher and arms to Iraq in documents he had read so far.
Prime ministers and senior cabinet officials have given oral evidence in
previous inquiries, although not in public or on such a politically
sensitive issue.
The terms of the inquiry cover the extent to which arms and related 'dual
use' defence equipment may have reached Iraq from the UK with the knowledge
or complicity of government and in breach of official guidelines and export
licensing arrangements.
Although no evidence will be taken on oath, some civil servants believe the
judge has been given unprecedented arbitrary powers to decide on issues
affecting the national interest which may raise the political stakes once
the inquiry gets under way.
Lord Justice Scott yesterday released the text of a letter from Sir Robin
Butler, head of the home Civil Service, empowering him to decide whether or
not evidence should be held in camera.
Separately Lord Justice Scott has been given an undertaking by Sir Nicholas
Lyell, attorney-general, that no individual giving evidence to the inquiry
will face subsequent criminal proceedings.
Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil
Servants, the trade union representing the top ranks of the Civil Service,
said the moves would reassure her members who had voiced concern that they
might risk prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.
She also said she had been personally reassured by Sir Robin that no civil
servant would be considered in breach of his or her employment contract,
which contains confidentiality and loyalty clauses.
Lord Justice Scott's decision to have public proceedings well under way
while parliament is in session will leave the opposition free to press
ministers on their testimony with the protection of parliamentary privilege.
He has spent recent weeks pressing government departments to release
documents.

FT  01 APR 93 / French PM orders austerity cuts worth Pounds 2.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, signalled his new
government's priorities yesterday by ordering austerity measures at home,
and by announcing that his first foreign trip would be to see Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in Germany.
Convening his 30-strong cabinet for the first time, Mr Balladur said he
wanted 'at least FFr20bn' (Pounds 2.5bn) in spending cuts. This would start
with cost-trimming in the ministers' own departments to curb a budget
deficit which it is estimated would otherwise rise to FFr300bn this year.
The prime minister will announce his full programme to the French parliament
on April 8. Parliament meets tomorrow for the first time since the
conservative coalition's landslide victory in Sunday's elections.
Mr Balladur had wanted to see Mr Kohl as early as next week, the government
spokesman said, but could do so only after the German leader returned to
Bonn from holiday on April 19.
Mr Balladur's centre-right government has come to power with a 'new
initiative' on monetary co-operation with Germany as its most specific
manifesto promise in the foreign policy field.
The premier's enthusiasm to cement the links between France and Germany is
shared by Mr Edmond Alphandery, his economics minister.
Mr Alphandery, a centrist politician and former economics professor, plans
to meet his German counterpart, Mr Theo Waigel, at the Group of Seven summit
which starts on April 14 in Tokyo. Mr Alphandery yesterday stressed his
support for the franc fort policy of protecting the French currency. 'Our
main objective will be to restore confidence in economic and financial
circles,' he said.
The Balladur team also hopes the German government will give a more
sympathetic hearing to French complaints about the European Commission's
conduct of the Gatt negotiations, particularly in agriculture.
Mr Jean Puech, minister for farming and fisheries, promised to conduct 'an
active, permanent and vigorous defence of our agricultural and maritime
interests, in Gatt as well as in Brussels'.
The chances of Mr Puech clashing with fellow EC ministers and the Commission
are therefore all the greater, because France's fishermen have recently been
following the example of the country's farmers in carrying out often violent
protests at what they see as the EC's refusal to protect them from cheap
imports. These protests culminated in an incident last Sunday, when three
British navy officers were abducted by French trawlermen.
Le Monde newspaper commented yesterday that in combining farm and fishing
responsibilities in one portfolio, Mr Balladur had created a sort of
'alternative European affairs ministry', which could clash with ministers
with formal responsibility for EC policy. The government's air fleet is to
have its budget trimmed by a third, and ministers were asked to take
scheduled air flights whenever possible.

FT  01 APR 93 / Lamont defends plans for sharp tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday defended his plans to increase
taxes sharply in 1994-95 against charges that they will hit industrial and
consumer confidence this year.
Appearing before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, he said
he wanted to make it 'crystal clear' that to leave the UK's high public
sector borrowing requirement uncorrected would be to take an unacceptable
risk with the medium-term prosperity of Britain.
He said his Budget plan to tackle the deficit by raising revenues by 1 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1994-95 and 1.4 per cent the following
financial year was the best way of achieving sustained economic recovery. In
his Budget, the chancellor forecast that the PSBR would reach Pounds 50bn in
1993-94 after Pounds 35bn in 1992-93.
Earlier the committee had heard Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England, declare that 'in all probability' the recession was over.
Although Mr Leigh-Pemberton expressed concern about the prospect of
unemployment continuing at its present high level of around 3m, he made
clear that he did not favour a further cut in bank base rates from their
current 6 per cent level.
The Bank governor pleaded instead for a period of stable interest rates. He
said he was sceptical whether further cuts would be passed on to borrowers
by banks and building societies and whether they would help recovery
further.
Reacting to hostile questioning from Labour members of the cross-party
committee who said he should have done more for the unemployed, the
chancellor said that a return to growth and action on the deficit were the
way to combat unemployment.
Mr Lamont, who answered questions without notes or assistance from his
officials for about 1 3/4 hours, made clear, however, that the main
innovation of this year's Budget - the announcement of specific tax
increases for future financial years - was unlikely to be a permanent
feature of British fiscal policy.
It was devised to handle the dilemma posed by a high and widening public
sector deficit when confidence in economic recovery was fragile. A sharp tax
rise beyond the Pounds 490m planned in the Budget for the 1993-94 financial
year would have had a significant impact on confidence.
Both Mr Leigh-Pemberton and Mr Lamont expressed some concern about the UK's
high current account balance of payments deficit, which the Treasury expects
to reach Pounds 17.5bn this year. However, the chancellor assured MPs that
it would easily be financed.
Both the governor and chancellor insisted that the UK was notpursuing a
policy of competitive devaluation of sterling, in spite of the misgivings
expressed by some of Britain's European Community partners. Both men spoke
in favour of a stronger pound.
In his testimony, Mr Leigh-Pemberton told the committee Britain might be
'living beyond its means' in spending too much on social security at a time
of a growing government deficit.
He said the high level of government spending on welfare benefits was a
'serious element' to the concern about the UK's large borrowing requirement.
It was 'not impossible' that to reduce the deficit, the Treasury might have
to increase taxes by more than the Pounds 16bn already promised in the next
three years.
UK government bonds surged by more than a point on news that the Bank of
England's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year gilts - the biggest auction of UK
government stock - had been well-received. The Bank also announced a further
Pounds 600m of 8 per cent stock due 2003 available for sale from today. Page

FT  01 APR 93 / Labour moves to support change in voting system: Committee
opts for French-style elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party last night took a significant step towards backing
electoral reform for the Commons when its Plant committee on alternative
voting systems agreed to recommend a limited form of proportional
representation.
The move, after an inquiry lasting more that two years, could prove a
watershed for Labour and represented a victory for reformists within the
party.
The committee will also recommend a proportional election system for the
House of Lords and the European Parliament.
However, the narrowness of the voting highlighted the deep splits within the
Labour movement over electoral reform. These are expected to be reflected in
the committee's final report after Easter.
Moreover, the 'supplementary vote' election system proposed for the Commons
is seen as a compromise and unambitious by supporters of PR. Similar to the
French system, it would inject only a small measure of proportionality.
Mr John Smith, Labour's leader, will not set out his view until after the
final report is considered by Labour's National Executive Committee later
this month, but he is regarded as cautious about reform. A final decision
would have to be approved at the party's annual conference in October.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary and an opponent of PR, accused
the Plant committee of 'bouncing' the NEC, which met yesterday, by the
timing of its report.
'They know we cannot meet again for four or five weeks to receive their
report. What they have done by making the decision today is to guarantee the
maximum controversy,' he said.
Mr Smith recognises that radical change could lead to fierce internal rows.
The uncertain message from the Plant committee's vote last night could make
him to decide against any damaging confrontation - or to propose a national
referendum before a new system is implemented.
A New Statesman magazine survey yesterday showed a majority - 59 per cent -
of Labour MPs wanting electoral reform, but a substantial minority of 36 per
cent wanted to keep the 'first past the post' system.
Those who have opposed any move away from the existing system include Mrs
Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader and a member of the Plant
committee.
The committee, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University,
had been split on electoral reform. But after meeting for three hours last
night it finally voted by 10 votes to six in favour of the principle of
reforming the electoral system.
The committee's members then went on to decide by 11 votes to four that any
new system had to be based on MPs representing individual constituencies,
rather than being elected in strict proportion to the number of votes a
party wins nationally.
In a final vote, the committee agreed by nine votes to seven to recommend
the 'supplementary vote' system - a method similar to that used in French
elections but avoiding two separate polling days. On calculations expected
to be included in the final Plant report, the 'supplementary system' would
have resulted in a hung parliament in last April's general election.
For the House of Lords and the European Parliament, the Plant committee will
recommend electing members from a series of regional lists in proportion to
political parties' voting strengths.
Mr Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrats' constitutional affairs
spokesman, said there should now be cross-party discussions on electoral
reform. But Liberal Democrat reaction last night fell short of suggesting
that the two main opposition parties are much closer to an electoral pact -
a move which would alarm Conservative party strategists.
