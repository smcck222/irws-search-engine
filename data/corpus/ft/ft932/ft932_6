NUFFIELD: A BIOGRAPHY by Martin Adeney Robert Hale Pounds 18.99, 224 pages
ANYONE WITH an interest in the decline and fall of British industrial power
must have regard to the motor industry and in particular to the story of
William Morris, the first Lord Nuffield.
In the late 1920s, the Oxford-based Morris and his Birmingham rival Austin
held 60 per cent of the British car market, prompting Edsel Ford, son of
Henry, to report to his father: 'We have been defeated and licked in
Britain.'
William Morris, the son of an Oxfordshire farmer, who started his business
life as a bicycle repair boy, was the man chiefly responsible for that state
of affairs. His intuitive grasp of popular taste, his mechanic's commitment
to building reliable machines, and his more surprising vigour in addressing
international trends in his industry, were the qualities that marked him
out.
Like the Japanese half a century later, Morris recognised that his early
designs and successes would count for nothing if others - notably Ford -
used more efficient production methods to offer lower prices. As early as
1913, with his company barely profitable, he crossed the Atlantic to study
American methods and to seek deals with American components manufacturers.
The result was the Morris Cowley and the Morris Oxford and the company's
projection, following the hiatus of the 1914-18 war, into the front rank as
a volume car producer.
In the heydays of the 1920s Morris continued to amass durable motor trade
insights. He was an early proponent of hire purchase and marketing devices
such as owners' clubs and more than any of his competitors he recognised
that his customers would be impressed by cars loaded with 'free' extras.
It is difficult to separate the reasons for the Morris company's subsequent
decline from an account of the man. Energetic and capable of vaulting
optimism, Morris also had an insecure and even paranoid side which prevented
him trusting senior colleagues or seeing the potential in alliances with
rivals. Most specifically, he fell out with the equally headstrong Leonard
Lord, who left Morris in 1936, after the founder had refused his demand for
a share in the company, to run Austin, where he vowed to undercut Morris at
every model launch and to take Cowley apart 'brick by brick.'
Morris's own inability to delegate was compounded and perhaps rendered fatal
by the circumstances of his time. In a country that had yet to recognise the
fading sunset hanging over the Empire, he allowed himself to be distracted
by the Australian market and the 'Empire' car project, which never got into
production. His attraction to politics, in which his bullying egoism scored
local successes, seems not to have nourished insight into global trends
between the wars.
Above all, he failed to see that his early success in building, for its
time, a lean production system was one that he would have to repeat again
and again in one lifetime if his achievement was not to perish. As Adeney
says, he was not so much a Victorian industrial paternalist as an Edwardian,
'a product of a more overblown age when much of the Victorian striving had
been replaced by a more complacent feeling that Britannia ruled the waves
and much of the world by right.' In the end, Morris was a management
failure.
Perhaps he sensed that he had moved out of his depth, even though he was not
a man to make such an admission. In the last 20 years of his life, before
his death in 1963, he devoted most of his attention to philanthropic work,
based upon the Nuffield Foundation. That was a role in which his autocratic
and irascible temper could be more easily accommodated and through which he
did much good. It also, however, yielded the irony that his acquired name,
Nuffield, would live longer, on the gate of an Oxford college, than his
family name in either the register of British corporations or upon the
bodywork of a British car.

THE BUSINESS DICTIONARY OF COMPUTERS by Jerry M Rosenberg John Wiley Pounds
39.95, 403 pages
SOME PEOPLE read dictionaries for fun, but it would take an uncommon turn of
mind to enjoy browsing through a dictionary of computing.
The Business Dictionary of Computers, however, is a useful addition to the
works of reference available to those who might need to know the meaning of
 -for example - disabled module, global variable symbol or sparse array just
once in a lifetime.
Written by Professor Jerry M. Rosenberg, of Rutgers University, it contains
definitions of 7,500 such phrases. It suffers from the usual
American-centred view of the business data processing world.
The Univac 1 is described as the first commercial electronic computer. No
mention of Leo, Ace or Atlas, alas.

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE by Harald A Benink Kluwer Academic
Publishers 202 pages
THE financial services industry in Europe probably faces a bigger challenge
than any other sector from the Single Market officially established at the
beginning of 1993. Whereas manufactured goods have travelled relatively
easily across borders in the past (though there are now even fewer
impediments), many providers of financial services - especially in the
retail markets - have until now found it almost impossible to penetrate
European frontiers, either because of regulatory barriers or daunting tax
obstacles.
Harald Benink, a Limburg University professor based, appropriately enough,
in Maastricht, sets out the legislative framework that will determine the
future shape of the EC's financial services industry. Most of this framework
is now in place - for banking and securities, for instance - but the life
assurance directive does not come into force until July 1994 and the pension
fund legislation appears stalled.
Financial institutions now face fundamental strategic decisions. Benink
warns, however, that they should not rush headlong into growth; in the US,
with a population about three-quarters that of the EC, banks have found
efficiency more important than size. He translates the US motto 'don't get
bigger, get fitter' into a European version: 'In any case get fitter, and if
necessary get bigger'.
Although an academic work, it may prove useful for commercial operators
looking for a volume that covers much of the detail of the EC's legal
structure for financial services.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): Business in the
privatised East - Trade / Linda Bilmes picks the best guides through the
maze of political and economic changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LAST YEAR, when the FT in this Review published a guide to books and
newsletters on Eastern Europe and the CIS, most readers were looking for
basic information. Tania Konn, who runs the Central and East European
Business Information Service (CEEBIS) at Glasgow University, says people
used to ring up and ask 'Can you give me any information on Poland?.'
Now, those seeking to keep abreast of developments have a much more complex
task. Some 28 countries (including Slovakia, Croatia, etc.) are in the
throes of economic reform. New laws and edicts are appearing constantly.
Many westerners now have a direct stake in the fortunes of one or more
companies in the region.
According to Ms. Konn, still the best source of information in the UK:
'People today have very specific enquiries. They need information on a
particular company or legal issue.'
Perhaps the most crucial area is the process of privatisation, in which
thousands of enterprises are being sold throughout Russia, Ukraine and
Eastern Europe. 'Privatisation' includes the selling off of neighbourhood
restaurants as well as the steel industry; selling land and housing as well
as shares and vouchers.
The success of privatisation in each country affects other crucial aspects
of reform, such as labour market dynamics, international aid and IMF
targets. Hence, almost every book and newsletter on the region deals with
privatisation to some degree. Here is a guide to the most useful,
up-to-date, and comprehensive sources.
For general, recent information, East European Privatisation News is a
monthly newsletter covering the privatisation efforts in Eastern Europe and
the CIS. It is targeted toward western investors and advisers; thus it is
focused on opportunities for investment and deals, recent acquisitions,
consultancy contracts, etc. (EEPN, Pounds 250 pa. Tel: Oxford 608811).
Another good source is the Eastern European Investment Magazine, a glossy
monthly published in the US. It provides thorough coverage of western
transactions (acquisitions, joint ventures, start-ups) in all 28 countries
and reviews recent developments in privatisation. It also offers a database
with detailed information on all transactions involving western partners
and/or investors. (Dollars 580 pa. UK office: 081-998 9287).
Finance East Europe offers bi-monthly updates related to finance and
investment. It covers privatisation and restructuring, mergers and
acquisitions and capital markets developments, and provides a layman's
synopsis of legal changes affecting the above. (FT Business Information,
Pounds 395 pa. 071-240 9391).
A number of excellent publications devote considerable space to
privatisation. These include the bi-weekly PlanEcon Business Reports whose
recent issues have focused on privatisation in Poland and the Czech
Republic, (PlanEcon Inc., Dollars 1600 pa. 081-545 6206); BNA's Eastern
Europe Reporter, (BNA International Inc., London Dollars 850 pa,
fortnightly); Central European (Euromoney, Pounds 240 pa, six a year.
0444-440-421); and Insight East European Business Report, published in
Budapest, which provides a more European perspective on privatisation
efforts. (Insight Publishing, Pounds 200 pa. 081-203 1883).
New Markets Monthly is a snappy newsletter which for Pounds 135 pa has a
'bulletin board' listing recent privatisations, takeovers, and appointments
of sectoral advisers (eg Morgan Grenfell for the Polish tobacco industry,
and Kleinwort Benson for Polish ball bearings). Additionally, the various
publications of the Economist Intelligence Unit (weekly newsletter Business
Central Europe, and the quarterly book Doing Business with Eastern Europe)
cover the major privatisation events in the region.
Anyone wishing to follow the constantly changing legal aspects of ownership,
share distribution, foreign investment, and so forth should subscribe to one
of the legal newsletters, such as Butterworth's Central &amp; East European Law
Bulletin (Butterworth's, London Pounds 210 pa, quarterly) or East European
Business Law (FT Newsletters, Pounds 390 pa, monthly).
There is also a series by Longman Law, Tax &amp; Finance entitled Legal Aspects
of Doing Business in the Czech and Slovak Republics, also available for
Hungary, Poland, and Russia (Longman Law, Pounds 75).
Generalist publications can supply a flavour of what is happening, but to
follow recent events in-depth it is necessary to monitor the privatisation
process in each country. There is enormous variation; Poland and Hungary are
advanced in their privatisation efforts, others such as Bulgaria are just
about to embark upon the process. Fortunately, reliable country-specific
sources do exist.
For Russia, the essential handbook is The Russian Privatisation Manual,
produced by the Russian Ministry of Privatisation (GKI), the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the EC. It is roughly the
English language version of the manual used by the GKI.
Volume I deals with the nitty-gritty of privatisation in Russia: voucher
schemes, share auctions, valuation and liquidation of assets, privatisation
of enterprises, foreign advisers, foreign investment, and employees' rights.
Volume II covers laws and regulations affecting ownership, leases,
privatisation of land, etc. The books are easy to use, with coloured
diagrams and flow charts. Published by Euromoney Books, Dollars 495,
including three updates per year. 0752-695 745). Another guide,
Privatisation of Russian State Companies &amp; the Potential Investment
Opportunities (Trajan Consultants, London, Pounds 275) provides background
and focuses on housing and shipping.
For specific updates on privatisation activities in Russia the best source
is News from Russia, a collection of nine newsletters, including bulletins
on privatisation, legislation and Russian business news. It may be ordered
by fax or electronically from A&amp;G Information Services, St. Petersburg,
Russia Pounds 29 pa, 812-278-1812. Comersant, a weekly commercial newspaper
published in English and Russian, reports on all the latest edicts and
regulatory changes but offers limited analysis of the data.
A number of CIS countries, most notably the Ukraine, have also begun
privatisation programmes. Information is scattered in general newsletters,
such as Ukrainian Business News Band Kiev Letter. The best way to find
specific information is by contacting CEEBIS at Glasgow University. (CEEBIS.
041-339 8855, Data enquiry service Pounds 50/hour).
For the East European countries, data is abundant. The PlanEcon Database on
Privatized Czech and Slovak Enterprises provides information on 988 Czech
and 503 Slovak enterprises. In Hungary, the State Property Agency has
produced a Catalogue of the Shares in Transformed Hungarian State-Owned
Enterprises Ready for Purchase, a publication called Privatisation
Opportunities in Industry &amp; Trade. The agency also produces a newsletter
with details of specific transactions.
In Poland, where privatisation is well advanced, there are a number of
publications which report on the current efforts, as well as the progress of
newly-privatised firms. The weekly Warsaw Voice, provides lively, critical
coverage of business issues, including privatisation. (Warsaw Voice, Pounds
94 pa). The Polish Commercial Counsellor's Office in London puts out a Guide
for Business Activities in Poland, which focuses on opportunities for
western investment in Polish firms.
One of the best country-specific sources is Bulgarian - a fortnightly
magazine called 168 Hours BBN. This lively publication covers all business
news in Bulgaria but with particular emphasis on the new privatisation
programme, opportunities for investment, legislation and details of how
investment deals are being structured. (Bulgarian Business News,
Subscription Dollars 364 pa. Sofia 44 34 77).
Given the pace of developments, few reference books can provide truly
up-to-date information for western investors. However, a number provide
background and critique of privatisation in the region. These shed light on
the different governments' objectives for privatisation, and how the
transition from a planned to a market economy is being carried out.
The Central European University (CEU), funded by George Soros, is putting
out a series of CEU Privatization Reports addressing topics such as leasing,
management contracts and privatisation of specific sectors. The first book
is Privatization Process in Central Europe, by R. Frydman, A. Rapaczynski
and J. Earle (Pounds 10 paperback), which explains the privatisation
programmes and legal framework in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland
and Romania.
Other recent books of interest include: Eastern Promise: Privatisation
Strategy for Post Communist Countries (P. Reynolds and P. Young, Adam Smith
Institute, Pounds 65); Methods of Privatising Large Enterprises (OECD,
FFr150); Privatisation in East Europe and the Former Soviet Union (C. Jones,
FT Management Reports, Pounds 270); and Privatisation in Central &amp; Eastern
Europe, which focuses on legal issues (P. Saracevic, Graham &amp; Trotman,
Pounds 78). All four provide background into the privatisation process and
how it is restructuring the economies of Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet states.
Businesses which require just up-to-the-minute information may wish to link
with an electronic database. Business International, Reuters, IP Sharp
Associates, the FT, and ICC International Business Research all offer
specialist services for the region. The ICC database includes news affecting
privatisation by country. Also useful is the Munich-based GBI (German
Business Information), which covers East European company transactions in
detail.
There are several free sources of information, including the local Chambers
of Commerce, the East European Trades Council, the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) and, increasingly, the business attaches in the embassies of
East European/CIS countries. The DTI has telephone lines dealing with
business enquiries for each country (071-215 5265 for CIS countries; 071-215
4735 for Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Poland; and 071-215 4812 for
Romania, Albania, Slovenia, etc.)
For most East European and former Soviet countries, privatisation has not
been easy. Many governments are ambivalent toward the process; there is
profound disagreement as to the speed and methods by which companies should
be turned over to the market. The frequent changes in rules and
implementation for privatisation are a reflection of the shifting political
climates. Anyone wishing to anticipate developments in the region needs to
watch the overall situation in a country as well as the detail of
transactions.

THE CHARITY BUSINESS: THE NEW PHILANTHROPISTS by Tom Lloyd John Murray
Pounds 19.99, 248 pages
THE CHARITY industry in Britain and throughout the developed world is now
very big business indeed. From Live Aid to Band Aid and Comic Relief, from
corporate giving and private philanthropy to little old ladies with street
corner collection boxes, the charity business today runs to big numbers.
In the UK alone, an estimated Pounds 17bn a year is handled through more
than 165,000 charities and associated endeavours. The Charity Commission,
according to this study, registers a new charity every 30 minutes of its
working day.
For its sheer size and the number of its participants - both givers and
receivers - the business must be about the most unregulated in the country,
the light touch of the Commission making the Securities and Investments
Board seem like a regulatory steamroller. Not surprisingly, therefore, the
industry attracts its unfair share of conmen and dubious fundraisers, with
some villains and fraudsters creaming of as much as 90 per cent of donations
from a generous and unsuspecting public.
The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee reported a few years ago on
the workings of the Charity Commission, having noted that tax exemptions for
UK charities were then costing non-exempt taxpayers some Pounds 2.5bn a year
in lost revenue, or equal to 5 per cent of the government's projected budget
overspend in the current year. The committee took the commissioners to task
on almost every aspect of their work. It dismissed the plea that their
resources were inadequate, and committee chairman Robert Sheldon asked: 'Why
is it because they cannot do everything, they did nothing?'
Things have improved a lot since then, particularly with last year's
Charities Act, but there are still undetected rogues, even if many dubious
charitable activities are caught. In 1990 the Charity Commission removed
charitable status from a record 749 organisations as a result of its
investigations and a census to identify inactive charities. Little wonder
that more more and more of the public's generous giving is going to fewer -
and to the biggest and generally better run - charities.
Much of the giving is by individuals, but there is a growing list of
corporate givers, mainly through The Per Cent Club, founded in 1986 by the
then Hector Laing (now Lord Laing of Dunphail) of United Biscuits and based
on a similar (but Five Per Cent) initiative started in Minneapolis in the
US.
The UK Per Cent Club now has more than 300 members, qualification for
participating being a contribution of not less than half a per cent of UK
pre-tax profits, or 1 per cent of dividends, to the community. In addition,
there are the long-established corporate and family trusts which give to
charities, including names such as Weinstock, Palumbo, Cayzer, Whitbread,
Sainsbury, Hanson, Inchcape and Alan Sugar.
The whole business of giving, by whom and for what,is well compiled and
analysed by Tom Lloyd. The Charity Business: the New Philanthropists is a
real mine of information, from the interesting - which of the British Royals
is the biggest charitable draw? who are the big charity supporters among
show business? - to the downright informative.
In the second category are four interesting corporate case studies of what
motivates companies to give, where they direct their giving and, what they
get in return. The four are the National Freight Consortium (now NFC), Tate
and Lyle, United Biscuits and Pearson, whose interests include ownership of
the Financial Times.
Each has its own style and philosophy. The author writes: 'Openness and
UB-style evangelism are important in the differentiation of the corporate
reputation; a systematic approach, like Tate and Lyle's, is necessary if
investments in reputational assets are to be 'efficient' in the sense of
yielding good returns; NFC-style consultation with employees helps to widen
the 'ownership' of a company's reputation for citizenship and will therefore
make the company more attractive to potential recruits; Pearson's low-key
generosity fits well with the hands-off style of its management and with the
self-sufficiency of its high-quality operating companies.'
Lloyd's examination of the charity business does not stop at Britain,
although his glancing look at the US and Canada, France, Australia and Japan
(where the National Horse Racing Welfare is the biggest corporate giver,
well ahead of the Toyota Foundation) is largely headline stuff. Overall,
though, this is an informative read with some cautionary tales, not least
for the givers.

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES by Enzo R Grilli
Cambridge Pounds 35, 387 pages
THE European Community is the world's biggest market, its greatest source of
development aid, and its largest contributor to the international financial
institutions.
All these superlatives would normally encourage you to think that developing
countries would get a good deal out of their relationship with the EC. Not
so, according to this useful book by Enzo Grilli. The EC's aid policies are
ineffective and uncoordinated; the trade preferences it grants to developing
countries are meagre and ungenerous.
Above all, Grilli says, the EC's policies towards developing countries have
been characterised by what he calls 'limping regionalism': an almost
exclusive concentration on sub-Saharan Africa and a handful of other
countries in the Caribbean and Pacific - the so-called ACP countries.
This geographical narrowness is the child of history. When the Community was
first set up in the late 1930s, the colonialists among its founder members -
Italy, Belgium, but above all France - managed to transfer the burden of
their colonial responsibilities to the new Community, in effect by
unilaterally attaching their colonies to the Treaty of Rome. What this did
was to create a free trade area which comprised not only the original six
Community members, but also the 22 colonies and territories owned by the
six.
This initial burst of international nepotism was reinforced in the following
decades, culminating in the 1975 Lome Convention, which widened the circle
of the chosen to include the former colonial possessions of the Community's
newest member, the UK. Lome was hailed for a time as a new model for
development cooperation, promising a large pool of aid resources as well as
other gifts such as export stabilisation funds and non-reciprocal trade
preferences. Subsequent renewals of the Lome agreements, however, attracted
progressively less enthusiasm.
Grilli suggests that the colonial-funded geographical focus of the
Community's efforts in the developing world intensified during the 1970s and
1980s, effectively ignoring Latin America and Asia. But all this might seem
fair enough - who can criticise the EC for paying too much attention to
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, since it is
these countries that are most in need of aid? Who cares if Europe's motives
are straight out of Machiavelli, so long as the cheques get posted?
Things are not so simple. Grilli argues that the use of aid by Community
members as a bilateral political weapon allows serious questions to be
raised about the effectiveness of the aid, since it is disbursed in an
uncoordinated fashion with little regard for its economic benefits.
Moreover, the trade preferences that the EC grants have, it seems, done
nothing to prevent the economic decay of many developing countries, and
Grilli refers to studies which 'uniformly come to the conclusion that the
Lome Conventions failed to have any marked impact on ACP aggregate exports'.
Grilli's arguments about the nature of the EC's regionalism are compelling,
but he gives too little attention to how things might be changing. As
Africa's economic problems become more evidently malignant, the continent is
clearly losing its appeal for the Community's policy makers, especially now
that eastern Europe presents such an inviting claim on the EC's resources.
It is difficult to doubt the suggestion that eastern Europe will to some
extent replace Africa as the EC's 'region of choice.' It is perhaps a shame,
then, that this book was not written a year later, which would have allowed
more time to digest the emerging relationship between the EC and eastern
Europe, to show more clearly how the EC's regionalism is limping towards the
east.

DOING BUSINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA edited by Jonathan Reuvid Kogan Page Pounds
25, 300 pages
SELDOM CAN a publisher's blurb have been more revealing. 'This book is about
South African business practice and opportunity - not politics.' The
priggish note evokes the old South Africa, and the school of thought which
held that apartheid, business and sport occupied different compartments.
If you want a learned account of the rules governing business entities and
their regulation in South Africa, or a discourse on financial reporting and
auditing, this book may be helpful. But anyone planning to do business in
the new South Africa, and seeking a hard-headed appraisal of risks and
opportunities, will be disappointed. They will need to look elsewhere for
advice - perhaps starting with the emerging breed of 'consultants' who
exchange their political credentials and their contacts book for a seat on
the board.
The no-politics rule seems to have kept out, for example, any analysis of
ANC economic policy other than complacent reassurance. 'Nationalisation is
no longer on the ANC agenda,' we are told in the book's introduction.
Certainly that is what Ready to Govern, the ANC policy document, says - but
while hedging its bets. A future democratic South Africa, says the document,
will consider:
Increasing the public sector in strategic areas through, for example,
nationalisation.
Reducing the public sector in certain areas in ways that will enhance
efficiency, advance affirmative action and empower the historically
disadvantaged.
The book's introduction also confidently asserts: 'Nor is the 'unbundling'
of the interconnected conglomerates which dominate much of South African
industry . . . seen any longer as a political priority.' Oops] Since that
was written Gencor has unbundled. 'Now one of the capitalists has broken
ranks,' commented the FT's correspondent in Johannesburg at the time, 'it is
no longer possible to dismiss unbundling as an airy Marxist fancy. Indeed,
it is likely that South Africa has only witnessed the dawn of an era of
significant corporate restructuring.'
And what of affirmative action to redress the apartheid legacy? The National
African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the black business federation (not
included in the book's mediocre contacts list), has demanded that all
companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have 30 per cent black
board representation by 2000, that blacks hold 40 per cent of equity and 60
per cent of posts at all management levels. Unrealistic; but a sign of the
times that a really useful guide to business in the new South Africa would
have illuminated.

competitive jungle - Trade

BEYOND FREE TRADE: FIRMS, GOVERNMENTS AND GLOBAL COMPETITION edited by David
B Yoffie Harvard Business School Press Dollars 40, 466 pages
ANYONE WHO wants to understand the thinking behind President Clinton's more
aggressive approach to trade policy will find this book a help. Indeed, in
its quiet way it says quite a lot about the direction of the trade policy
debate generally.
For some time US opinion, which has tended to set the agenda in recent
years, has been moving away from the simple notion that comparative
advantage is all that matters and that the best policy is therefore to
ensure markets are open and unprotected. The realisation has grown that, for
certain industries, other things, such as regulation, matter as much, if not
more, to the direction of trade flows.
The starting point of this collective enquiry - it includes contributions
from nine separate authors - is that natural comparative advantage matters
only in the early stages of a product's life and for industries that are
highly fragmented. As industries become more concentrated - and entry
barriers grow - other forces swing into action. Decisions on location will
be taken with regard to what competitors are doing and shifts in government
regulation. Sometimes location decisions that no longer make particular
sense will not be reversed because companies suffer from inertia.
The thesis is tested with reference to a range of industries, from
semiconductors and computers to ball-bearings, mineral processing and
insurance. One conclusion is that as more companies compete head-to-head in
multiple international markets, the more they will gravitate towards similar
production locations, trade patterns and technical as well as managerial
capabilities. More interesting, though, is the underlying question of which
are best equipped to survive the process.
The book holds out one piece of advice for companies - that they need to
tackle their international and not just their domestic competition.
Caterpillar has emerged as one of the survivors in construction equipment,
but it had a tendency to worry too much about Dresser and too little about
Komatsu. Another conclusion of greater relevance for government policy is
that survivors benefit from a strong position in their domestic market.
The mistake the US made in telecommunications may have been to de-regulate
while other countries did not. Similarly the US has been more open than
other countries such as Germany and Japan to non-life insurance. As a result
its insurance industry suffers from intense price competition and damaging
cyclical swings. In Japan, where the industry is more regulated and local
companies control the distribution channels, the cycle is less vicious.
Domestic companies have a stronger base from which to expand
internationally.
One thus begins to see why US trade policy is so concerned with market
access. This is fine when it involves a genuine insistance on national
treatment - or regulatory policies that do not discriminate against
outsiders - and on international co-ordination of the de-regulation process.
This kind of question is likely to come up in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade if and when it can finally lay the Uruguay Round to rest.
Competition policy could well be on the agenda of future rounds.
More worrying is the book's lack of emphasis on the multilateral framework.
In her chapter on semiconductor trade Laura d'Andrea Tyson, who is now
President Clinton's chief economic adviser, glosses over the fact that
aspects of the 1986 US semiconductor agreement with Japan were declared
illegal by the Gatt. The book conveys the impression that the agreement is a
fine example of a government policy directed at influencing the flow of
trade. Some US companies resumed production as a result of the agreement
while, albeit slowly, foreign penetration of the Japanese market increased.
It matters little to Ms Tyson that users of semiconductors in Europe were
forced to pay higher prices. That tendency towards bilateralism, however, is
a reason for the rest of the world to be careful. This book is good at
identifying the issues; it would be even better if it tried to pre-empt the
more dangerous conclusions.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES REPORT 1993 IMD &amp; World Economic Forum SFr700
(Pounds 320) 355 pages
A BOLD analysis, this, at several different levels. But, first, what are
'Emerging Market Economies'? Twenty countries trying to make the transition
from state regulation to the market. In the league of mega-markets, there
are China, India and Russia (in that order, in the Report's view); in the
medium-sized markets, Poland and 'Czechoslovakia'; among the mini-markets,
Slovenia and Croatia.
So, what is bold about the analysis? Briefly, that it tries to evaluate the
comparative competitiveness of these transitional and volatile economies.
How does it define 'competitiveness'? By the capacity to gain market share
abroad as well as by the ability to create investment and trade at home.
This means 'the extent to which the specific obstacles on their way have
been overcome . . . (including inflation, unemployment, output,
privatisation, currency exchange, foreign trade, institution building,
political transition, and mental structures).'
Now if that isn't bold, it must be foolhardy. Who can assess, from the
outside, the degree to which, in comparison with each other, the attitudes
(or 'mental structures') of two different populations have altered? And even
in the case of data which is more quantifiable, how is one to heed the
Report's call for us to 'interpret the data carefully, keeping in mind the
biases resulting from unstable exchange rates, high inflation or differences
in statistical systems'?
This is an attempt to eat your cake and have it: if the data is not
reliable, surely any time spent in discussing its interpretation must be
wasted? Not really, the instigators of this Report argue: they have 12 years
of experience in working with imprecise data in their annual World
Competitiveness Report, and they are working with the latest figures. All
very well, but they should have provided, at the least, a Reliability Index
 -a guide to the degree of confidence they feel in each set of data, by
country and by subject of inquiry.
Nevertheless, if the Report is highly fallible, it is the only Report of its
sort. In working with the present darkness of economies which have such
great potential, any light must be welcomed.

VENTURE CAPITAL AT THE CROSSROADS by William D. Bygrave and Jeffry A Timmons
Harvard Business School Press. Dollars 35 356 pages
EUROPEAN venture capitalists, criticised for their move away from start-ups
and early stage finance, may take wry comfort from this fascinating study of
the US venture scene. American venture capital too has moved away from its
roots, backing innovative new businesses. It is now more aptly named
'merchant capital' or 'business development capital,' Bill Bygrave and Jeff
Timmons suggest. 'Venture capitalists don't create new businesses, they
steal them,' says one disillusioned entrepreneur.
The early days of venture capital in the US were exciting. The pioneers
played an important role in backing many companies which spearheaded
significant new industries. Many became powerful corporations. Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC), Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and Compaq
Computer all received venture backing.
The authors, academics with experience of founding businesses, describe the
creation of the personal computer industry, with considerable venture
capital money, as the largest legal creation of wealth in the US in the past
two decades.
They recount the story of the establishment, in 1946, of American Research &amp;
Development, the first firm to provide risk capital for new and growing
firms. New ventures had previously been financed by private individuals so
the creation of ARD is regarded as the decisive event in the establishment
of the industry.
ARD was set up to exploit technologies developed by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during the second world war. A co-founder, General
Georges Doriot, a Harvard professor, described its role as 'to watch, push,
worry and spread hope,' activities just as much needed now as in the
post-war period.
But as time has gone by venture capital's aspirations and role have changed.
This has been partly due to shifts in the sources of investment capital.
Private individuals have been replaced by pension funds with shorter time
horizons. Technology has developed but the late 1980s and 1990s have seen no
repetition of the technology wave based on the microprocessor, and
biotechnology.
The result has been that in the US and elsewhere venture capital has shifted
towards later stage investments in established, profitable businesses.
Technology investing has become a minority activity. Buy-outs now dominate
the sector.
But the shift of the venture industry to backing larger, established
companies threatens to lose the company-building skills so vital to the
entrepreneurial process. 'Classical' venture capital investing know-how has
been replaced with financial engineering skills. In Europe, in particular,
people coming into the industry have analytical and financial skills but no
business-building experience.
Does this matter? Bygrave and Timmons argue that it does. Stimulating
inventions and entrepreneurship is vital to national competitiveness and
requires not just tolerance by governments but active support.
They suggest, unconvincingly, that if Germany and Japan take up venture
capital in a big way the US could be relegated to second class status. In
fact, venture capital has had difficulty getting established in these
countries, which have different methods of financing industry. They are back
on firmer ground when arguing that small businesses create jobs, whereas, in
recent times, large corporations have destroyed them. Small companies are
also more innovative and more productive.
What of the future? They foresee an end to the current retrenchment of the
US venture industry by the mid-1990s and the beginnings of a shake-out in
Europe (this is already happening). By the year 2000 the US industry, with
Dollars 45bn to Dollars 50bn under management, will rank third behind Europe
and Japan while a new technology wave will prompt renewed interest in
start-ups and early stage investments. The attractiveness of a stock market
flotation will diminish. Entrepreneurs will plan increasingly for mergers or
trade sales.
This is open to challenge. Flotations fall in and out of favour depending on
the stock market and have recently proved popular in the US. Bygrave and
Timmons are also probably over-rating the vitality of classic venture
capital in Europe and Japan and underestimating its potential in the US.
More worrying for the industry is the importance the authors attach to a new
wave of technology. A financial sector which depends on the recurrence of
breakthroughs on the scale of the microprocessor would appear to be
vulnerable. Safer, surely, to rely, as European venture capital does, on
picking the best from a range of technologies and industry sectors?

UNDUE INFLUENCE by David Margolick William Morrow Dollars 23
FOR Dollars 23 - the cost of David Margolick's Undue Influence - you could
buy about six months' subscription to the tackiest tabloid of your choice.
It is a toss-up which 'read' would prove more edifying.
For, at heart, Mr Margolick's weighty tome on the battle over the Johnson &amp;
Johnson pharmaceuticals fortune is a tawdry tale padded out by a lot of
legal manouevres. The plot could be summarised in four simple clauses. Rich,
ageing womaniser marries pretty Polish maid; rich, ageing womaniser dies;
family disputes maid's right to inherit; lawyers get involved and everyone
settles.
This unappetising scenario actually unfolded in the early and mid-1980s, and
was only ever engrossing because of the personalities involved. Even today,
they command attention. For example, Basia, the one-time maid who became the
second Mrs Johnson, used Dollars 100m of her Dollars 350m inheritance to buy
the Gdansk shipyard - not quite the typical action of an airhead blonde.
But Mr Margolick's excuse for rehashing the story is to examine the legal
minutiae and the impact which the case had on some prestigious New York law
firms. Accordingly, he splits the book into two distinct parts. The first is
a relatively objective account of how Basia met Seward Johnson, how their
12-year marriage progressed, and some background on the murky antics of the
Johnson offspring. The second centres on the US law firms involved in the
tussle over Seward's will, and then on the trial itself.
The reader's response may follow similar lines. Part one has moderate
entertainment value. But when the same facts are batted to and fro at
inordinate length by a lot of overpaid legal professionals, tedium sets in.
Students of US trial practice may glean something; the rest of the world can
probably pass.
Matters are not improved by Mr Margolick's conviction that the more trivia a
reader is offered, the more fascinated he or she will become. Attempting to
flesh out the character of one lawyer involved, for example, he gives the
details of a totally unremarkable commute home, remembering to explain what
model of car took the individual from his station to his house, which
supermarket he shopped at, what he bought for supper, and so on. Even then,
the poor man does not escape. ' . . . The inside of his refrigerator was
austere, a bare light bulb shining on the bottles of imported beer and
splits of champagne he served to guests and the Perrier he kept for
himself.' For heaven's sake, has anyone seen a refrigerator light that
wasn't bare?
Only once does this painstaking approach pay off - and that, ironically, is
during the three chapters which deal with Seward Johnson's death. Here, Mr
Margolick's hour-by-hour account of how an extraordinarily egocentric but
vital individual surrenders his grip on life, becomes both powerful and
poignant. It only serves to demonstrate how little the lawyers matter.

BRITISH PROTECTIONISM AND THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: OVERSEAS COMMERCIAL
POLICY IN THE 1930s by Tim Rooth OUP, Pounds 40, 357 pages
ON SEPTEMBER 21 1931 the UK abandoned the gold standard. On March 1 1932,
when the Import Duties Act came into effect, Britain had finally adopted
full protection. Thus within less than six months two of the great symbols
of Britain's leadership of the 19th century international economy, the gold
standard and free trade, had gone. Analysing both measures together, as Tim
Rooth does in this commendable book, is vital to understand the history of
UK PLC.
Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 ignored the dramatic fall in
the UK's share of world trade. Between 1890 and 1929 Britain's share of
world exports in manufactures declined from 40.7 per cent to 20.4 per cent.
Britain was exporting the wrong commodities to the wrong places, Empire
countries such as India and Australia, where demand was weakest. Instead of
meeting the challenge posed by its competitors by developing newer
commodities, Britain had deflected it by finding new markets for old
products, and pumping up demand by the export of capital. The result was
high unemployment and deteriorating balance of payments. Enforced by the
need to meet the challenge of the US, Britain's return to the gold standard
aggravated the problems of UK exporters and made maintaining the value of
sterling even more difficult.
Support for protectionism was gaining ground even as the return to gold was
made. By raising prices, Keynes thought tariffs would reduce real wage cost,
the rigidity of which he saw as the prime cause of unemployment. A tariff
could help solve unemployment without jeopardising the gold standard. Keynes
did not favour devolution, because it would have undermined London as an
international banking centre and might start a series of competitive
devaluations. When devaluation happened, Keynes opposed tariffs, since by
causing the exchange rate to appreciate, they would reduce output and have
the opposite effect upon unemployment to that intended.
So why were they introduced? Rooth's argument is that the Conservative
majority in the National Government, led by Neville Chamberlain, was
enacting the protectionist policies championed by Chamberlain's father,
Joseph, in the 1890s.
Public opinion was also pro-protectionist. A Bankers' Manifesto signed that
year also complained that 'the sale of surplus foreign products in the
British market has steadily grown.' The more banal truth, is that, like the
luckless Norman Lamont, the government was simply trying to keep an eye on a
'variety of indicators.' They were as concerned about sterling, inflation,
and the balance of payments, as much as about unemployment.
The surprise is that Britain did manage to muddle through this period as
successfully as she did, using protectionism to bargain for trade advantages
in the markets of its chief suppliers of food and raw materials. Britain was
still an important market for primary producers, within and outside the
Empire. The depression, accentuated by the rise of protectionist barriers
elsewhere, gave Britain enhanced economic leverage.
Britain continued to favour the emergence of an Empire trading bloc for
itself in the organisation of its tariffs. It had still not addressed its
competitive weaknesses, but it was making the most of a weak hand when its
competitors were even weaker. Once Germany became stronger in the 1930s,
Britain's economic appeasement consisted of meeting the challenge by trying
to agree on target markets. The true test came with America's departure from
the gold standard. The Anglo-American trade agreement of 1938 was the first
sign of the US wanting to wrest free trade back onto the agenda and to its
own advantage. Even if the second world war had not consolidated its
hegemony over the rest of the world, the writing was on the wall.

THE CEDAR STORY: THE NIGHT THE CITY WAS SAVED by Charles Gordon
Sinclair-Stephenson Pounds 18.99, 326 pages
ALMOST everybody has now forgotten the collapse 20 years ago of Cedar
Holdings, an obscure second mortgage company. But not Charles Gordon, a
well-connected one-time journalist turned minor financier who is the author
of this elegantly written, if distinctly self-indulgent, history of a
secondary bank which crashed on the dramatic night of Wednesday, December
19, 1973.
Whether a participant in a drama should write the history is a moot point.
Certainly there is an overdose of score-settling here by the author, who was
closely involved in setting up Cedar in the 1960s for the Morrison family,
one-time dress shop proprietors who wanted to move into the more glamorous
worlds of property and banking.
Charles Gordon fixed them up with respectable institutional partners such as
the Unilever pension fund and Phoenix Assurance but he was pushed off the
board in 1971. Jack Morrison's 'detestable' nephew assumed a leading role,
and the company began to tap the short-term money markets in order to
finance expansion. Then the family, disastrously for them as it was to turn
out, merged their property company Amalgamated Securities into Cedar, mainly
in order to gain family voting control of the combined enterprise. The top
executives were just trying out their brand new Hawker Siddeley 125/600B
corporate jet when the secondary banking crisis struck. With unbelievable
suddenness the family fortune was lost.
According to Gordon's account, the Morrisons failed to understand the risks
of one of Britain's regular credit bubbles. But as the reader wades through
pages of name-dropping, of accounts of irrelevant French Riviera parties,
and of remarks such as 'my driver was waiting patiently outside Wilton's', a
different conclusion emerges: that the shortsighted Gordon designed a
cultural clash into Cedar, and even an ethnic one, because this was very
much the story of upstart Jewish businessmen colliding with establishment
institutions. Much later, in the 1980s, the collision was to be echoed when
the Bank of England clashed awkwardly with the Pakistani-controlled BCCI.
So to that awful night at the Bank of England in late 1973, when the fact
that the Jewish Morrisons were served with ham sandwiches was the least of
their problems.
Although not himself a participant at this final stage of the story, Charles
Gordon has crafted an entertaining reconstruction. For the sake of the
financial system it was declared by the Bank that Cedar had to open its
doors the next day; but the institutions, in exchange for their willingness
to replace the money extracted by stampeding depositors, stripped the
company of its property assets and closed it for new lending business. In
the end the deal only went through, after 1 am, because the family was in a
minority on the board. The City was saved; Jack Morrison was broken, and
died four years later worth Pounds 6,500.
Reading at times like a kind of Pseud's Guide to the Barber property boom,
the book is liberally peppered with flattery and putdowns: Stash Radziwill
was 'the quintessential European aristocrat' but Kenneth Cork, the
liquidator, spoke in an 'upper-class cockney accent'. There is much, much
more about people than about Cedar Holdings, but perhaps that is as it
should be.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF THREADNEEDLE STREET by James Fishman Carolina Academic
Press, 316 pages
THE OLD order already seems a world consigned to prehistory. In fact it is
less than six years since the City of London's Big Bang swept the system of
jobbers and independent stock brokers aside. However, that is time enough
for the academic perspective to be drawn. This lucid but detailed study is a
useful contribution to understanding the change, which is especially timely
in view of the current debate about the future of the Securities and
Investments Board.
It is helped perhaps by the fact that the author, James Fishman, a law
professor at Pace University, is an American. He therefore has the
objectivity of an outsider, even if this comes with a tendency to promote US
solutions such, for example, as his central recommendation that the SIB
should become more like the SEC.
At the heart of the debate over financial regulation has been the need to
draw a balance between a statutory or rule-based approach and
self-regulation by the industry itself. A mixture of the two is evident on
both sides of the Atlantic, but the US tilts more towards the former, the UK
to the latter.
A drawback of the statutory approach is that it gives the lawyers a field
day and quickly expands into a bureaucratic tyranny. Self-regulation by
industry practitioners is more flexible but there is the risk of regulatory
capture where the supervisory body simply ends up defending the interests of
the industry it is trying to control. There must thus be some questions
about its effectiveness.
Self-regulation seemed an obvious choice to the City as Big Bang approached.
Not only was this the tradition under which it had worked for a long time.
There was also the desire, after the Labour government of the 1970s, to keep
the government at arm's length. But the mistake of the SIB under its first
chairman, Sir Kenneth Berrill, was to be too heavy-handed. Its first rule
book covered 430 pages and weighed 4lb. To its horror the City discovered it
was becoming subject to the kind of rule-based regulation it had sought to
avoid.
Under its second chairman, Sir David Walker, the SIB retreated the original
concept of general principles, leaving more specific rules to be developed
by the specialist self-regulatory organisations. The UK system of regulation
has also played a useful role in preventing abuse through its authorisation
process, which weeds out unsuitable entrants to the market.
Yet the system remains flawed in several respects. It involves a cumbersome
network of overlapping responsibilities. Financial institutions face a high
cost of compliance because they may have to deal with several different
regulatory organisations. Some of these have proved extraordinarily weak and
prone to regulatory capture. IMRO, which covers fund management, was
criticised for not spotting the Maxwell pension frauds. FIMBRA's
responsibility for retail insurance broking left it weakened by compensation
payments.
The most glaring defect, though, has been failure to enforce the rules.
Indeed, the Blue Arrow affair came as a particularly nasty blow to the
concept of self-regulation, because the scandal enveloped institutions such
as National Westminster and Phillips and Drew which were at the centre of
the financial establishment. The author is rightly sceptical of the
contribution to enforcement made by the Department of Trade and Industry,
which he says is pervaded by a passive bureaucratic approach. Similarly the
serious Fraud Office is 'just another layer in the enforcement bureaucracy.'
He regards the SIB as an institution of more potential. It could be
strengthened and turned into a statutorily-based commission, not an arm of
government. Its main role would be to investigate and enforce, while the
Bank of England should have oversight over investor protection. Were these
changes to occur, the SIB would become more like the US SEC, which Fishman
admires because it is better co-ordinated than the UK regulators and
attracts high-calibre staff.
This goes rather further than the recent Large Report, which came too late
for coverage in the book. Mr Andrew Large, head of the SIB, also wants to
beef up the SIB, but he sees it more as a supervisor of the existing SROs.
That system should become more effective if those covering the retail market
were merged into one, stronger entity. Mr Fishman's solution would require
new legislation. Mr Large shies away from that, although he has proposed the
introduction of plea-bargaining, which exists in the US alongside the
availability of the civil penalties that makes the SEC's enforcement task
much easier. Were it to be introduced in the London market any budding
British Boeskys would really have to watch out.

A DOMESTIC HISTORY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 1930-1960 by Elizabeth Hennessy
Cambridge Pounds 60, 449 pages
EDDIE GEORGE, the incoming anti-inflationary governor of the Bank of
England, would be horrified to read a particular chapter of this absorbing
book. It tells how the bank 36 years ago unwittingly added to pressures for
rising prices by issuing a new highly-popular Pounds 5 note which overcame
'the traditional prejudice against the use of high sum notes.'
The incident is one of many anecdotes sketched out by Ms Hennessy in her
book, partly a story of an institution, partly social history and partly a
record of the UK's decline as a world power after the second world war.
The volume is distinctive for its appendix of the leading bank officials in
the 30-year period it covers. Look out in particular for Humphrey Charles
Baskerville Mynors, the bank's first economist, who took over in 1933, and
for Lucius Perronet Thompson-McCausland, an adviser to the governor after
the war.
You can read about how bank employees used to stuff kippers down the spines
of their huge ledgers during the 1930s and how many of them suffered
drinking problems because the work was so boring. There are hints of
tensions between bank and Treasury that are still evident today, as in 1947
when the two institutions fell out over methods for control of foreign
currency markets. Readers can find out about an ailment called Whitchurch
Throat - which employees evacuated to Whitchurch in Hampshire suffered from
during the war on account of the dry chalky soil - and how one of the bank's
first statistical treatises tried to entertain its readers by calculating
the likelihood of someone being run over by a car on a wet night in London.
The section on the bank's overseas department is especially worthwhile in
illustrating the disdain with which the bank viewed virtually all
foreigners.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Why we should stop
worrying and learn to love EMU - Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
ONE MONEY FOR EUROPE: THE ECONOMICS AND POLITICS OF MAASTRICHT by Malcolm
Crawford Macmillan Pounds 45, 363 pages
'IN THE interests of the people of western Europe, leaving aside
considerations of nostalgia or Euro-political grandiosity, economic and
monetary union is to be welcomed.' That is the principal conclusion of this
useful book. Malcolm Crawford concludes not merely that EMU will be
beneficial, even though 'the benefits are unlikely to be huge', but also
that it 'will almost certainly be implemented'. People should, in short,
stop worrying and learn to love EMU.
As a former economics editor of the Sunday Times, the author is just the
person to unravel the complexities and calm the contention surrounding Emu.
On the whole, he succeeds. The literature on EMU has become vast. But this
book is a valuable addition. Busy business people will find answers within
its to most of the questions about EMU they might have.
Inevitably, the book has flaws. It is, for example, already out of date in
some respects, since most of it was written before the ERM's recent crisis.
Yet much of it stands. The author would argue, for example, that this
turbulence merely reinforces his view that the ERM is best thought of as 'a
transitional expedient to EMU'.
Other important faults are that the book is too long and too expensive. Even
though there is a good summary, a skilled journalist like Mr Crawford should
have what he has to say down to some 200 pages. Despite the book's length,
it has omissions: the implications of German unification are slighted, as
are the workings of the sclerotic European labour market. The latter is
particularly surprising, since changes in the long term competitiveness of
Europe's regions would, in the absence of exchange rate adjustability,
largely depend on alterations in relative nominal wages.
The book is divided into two main parts. The first covers the background to
EMU and includes the history of the EC's monetary arrangements, the
economics of exchange rates and the workings of the ERM. The discussion of
the economics of exchange rates is good, though whether the author will be
able to convince British readers of the user-friendliness even of his simple
mathematics must be doubtful, since many of them will not have looked at an
equation since they were 15.
Also commendable is the book's honesty about the alleged achievements of the
ERM. Mr Crawford notes, for example, that 'the four EC countries that
achieved the best economic performance (during the 1980s) displayed the
least adhesion to the 'nominal anchor''. He concludes too that 'there is
little evidence that the reduction of inflation, which all EC countries have
achieved, has been the result of the ERM, or that if it was, the cost of
reducing it has been lessened by the ERM.'
The second part of the book is all about EMU. It covers the history of the
Maastricht treaty, EMU's economic implications, the convergence criteria,
the European System of Central Banks, EMU's implications for financial
institutions and for fiscal and regional policy, the role of the UK and the
question of federalism.
Among EMU's benefits, the author lists greater convenience for the citizens
of the EC, increased competition among EC firms, creation of an integrated
EC-wide payments system, more active financial markets and elimination of
German monetary hegemony. An important point he makes is the superiority of
EMU to the ERM because of its greater credibility. 'The markets generally
know,' he correctly insists, 'that the most devalued currency of all in
economic policy is the promise of a minister that he will never devalue.'
Where the author is most critical is of the convergence criteria. It is not
that he doubts the need for some such criteria, but he rightly questions the
relevance of the interest rate condition, the emphasis on price (rather than
labour cost) inflation and the limit on budget deficits to 3 per cent of
gross domestic product. Probably the most justifiable of all the criteria is
that on ratios of public debt to GDP, but this, it appears, is the one most
likely to be ignored, largely for the political reason that it would exclude
Belgium from EMU.
How far the author's positive assessment of EMU is justified is debatable.
It is impossible even to be confident that EMU will happen, but should it
not do so the blow to the EC's credibility could well prove terminal.
Unfortunately, achievement of EMU could also prove terminal, since it would,
whatever Mr Crawford says, put additional strains on the political
legitimacy of EC institutions. The failure to understand this point is among
the book's more important weaknesses. For Mr Crawford, the division of
political responsibilities is just a matter of efficiency. Things are not
that simple. Efficiency is in the eye of the beholder. What matters at least
as much is the legitimacy of decision-making institutions.
There are sound economic and political reasons for questioning the wisdom of
EMU. But their force depends on the alternatives. In the UK, it appears, the
alternative is someone like the present chancellor of the exchequer, who is
apparently determined to restart the British go-stop cycle. Mr Clarke is a
Europhile. Perhaps his secret plan is to demonstrate to the sceptical
British that EMU, for all its risks, would be far better than continued
management of their monetary affairs by the wallies of Westminster.

BRITISH IMPERIALISM: INNOVATION AND EXPANSION 1688-1914 by P J Cain and A G
Hopkins Longman Pounds 38/Pounds 16.99 504 pages
BRITISH IMPERIALISM: CRISIS AND DECONSTRUCTION 1914-1990 Longman Pounds
30/Pounds 11.99 337 pages
'THE GREATEST factor in the material prosperity of this country', wrote an
official in the British Treasury in 1924, 'is not manufacturing, important
as that is, but commerce. The diversion of commerce to other countries is
the severest loss to which we could be exposed'.
The theme of this absorbing two-volume study of British imperialism is the
central role of finance and commerce, based in London and the Home Counties,
in influencing Britain's economic policy and, in particular, her overseas
expansion. The authors show in convincing detail how the interests of
manufacturing industry consistently took second place to those of the
'gentlemanly capitalists' who held the levers of power in the City, the Bank
of England and the Treasury. But this is not another diatribe against
Britain's anti-industrial culture. It is a balanced and highly readable
account of a well-organised, socially cohesive and internationally-minded
community of bankers and merchants, which had a profound effect on Britain
and the world economy.
Cain and Hopkins argue that Britain's strength in financial services
preceded the Industrial Revolution and persisted long after the country's
staple industries had gone into decline. Financial innovations in the 1690s,
including the foundation of the Bank of England and the creation of the
national debt, led to the evolution of specialised merchant banks, the rise
of the stock exchange and the growing use of bills of exchange to settle
domestic and international obligations. Provincial cities such as Liverpool,
Bristol and Glasgow took part in the financial revolution, but London was
the biggest beneficiary, partly because of its proximity to parliament and
the departments of state. 'The City was distinguished from the outset by its
close involvement with government and its pronounced overseas orientation'.
From the early 18th century the leaders of the City's banks and merchanting
houses became socially and commercially entwined with the country's
landowning families. They went to the same public schools and absorbed the
same gentlemanly culture, in which the accumulation of wealth was
acceptable, provided it was kept separate from the vulgar business of making
commodities. As the Empire expanded, the same set of values was spread
around the world through the trading companies and overseas banks, whose
managers came from the same social background as the senior men in the
Foreign Office and the Treasury.
With the move to free trade in the 1840s, a new form of gentlemanly
capitalism took shape. While the profitability of agriculture declined and
with it the power of the landowners, the City used its financial skills to
launch sterling on its international career and to secure the invisible
earnings which became so important to the country's balance of payments. The
growth of empire was, among other things, 'a means of capitalising on
Britain's comparative advantage in finance and commercial services', turning
the country into the warehouse and banker of the world, not its workshop.
City, Whitehall and Parliament persuaded themselves that the interests of
finance and services were those of the nation and that pressures coming from
Manchester, Birmingham or Glasgow 'were at best partial and at worst
self-serving'.
Did the City's bias in favour of overseas investment and its social
separateness from the provinces contribute to Britain's industrial decline?
As Cain and Hopkins show, Britain had two capital markets, at least up to
1914. Provincial businessmen found local sources of finance adequate,
without needing large-scale recourse to the City. The City's response was to
find opportunities abroad. 'It is difficult to blame the City for failing to
adapt to industry's needs when the industry it was supposed to serve did not
put forth radical new demands for its services'.
This is not to say that heavy overseas investment did not cause some
long-term damage. The authors suggest that the ease with which capital could
be invested abroad and earn handsome returns had the indirect effect of
blunting entrepreneurial drive. Large invisible earnings created a level of
prosperity which put off the need for fundamental industrial change. At the
same time the availability of captive markets in the Empire, reinforced by
direct investment in the colonies, was a force for conservatism in industry.
It was not the City's fault, the authors suggest, that industry did not
expand faster. 'It is idle to complain that no finance capitalism on a
German model developed in Britain in the late nineteenth century when
British industry did not grow and change as rapidly as it did on the
Continent'.
A recurring strand in the story is the failure of industrialists to
influence government policy, even at the height of the industrial
revolution. Richard Cobden hoped that the coming of free trade would usher
in the triumph of industrialism in Britain, but the manufacturing interests
which he represented did not have the wealth or influence to oust the
dominant ideology. Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform campaign was a cry of
alarm about the prospect of a de-industrialised Britain. As he put it in
1904, 'whereas at one time England was the greatest manufacturing country,
now its people are more and more employed in finance, in distribution, in
domestic service and in other occupations of the same kind.'
Chamberlain was strongly supported by the newer entrepreneurs, those most
hurt by German competition and most impressed by German success. But
traditional businessmen, like the Manchester cotton masters, were content
with the status quo. Even in the inter-war period, when the world economic
crisis prompted some closing of ranks, British industry
Turn to Page 2
Cornerstone of Empire
From Page 1
was 'too small in scale, too fragmented and too bitterly competitive to
allow any strategy to emerge which could match that of the City in terms of
coherence and simplicity'.
How have the gentlemanly capitalists adapted to the loss of empire and the
end of the sterling area? Here Cain and Hopkins are at their least
convincing.
While the City has shown remarkable powers of survival - 'the most dynamic
region of the British economy for the past 150 years' - it is not so obvious
that the Thatcher government 'fell into a pattern of decision-making which
promoted the interests of the City, where gentlemanly capitalists still
retain a strong influence', or that manufacturing is controlled by a small
group of financial managers, with 'the gentlemanly directors of the clearing
banks and merchant banks' at its heart.
Both the City and industry have had to come to terms with Britain's new role
as a medium-sized nation in an integrated European economy, and the
character of both has been substantially changed in the process. Traces of
the old gentlemanly values and lifestyle are still visible, but more as a
historical curiosity than a dominant influence on national life.

FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market welcomed Thorn EMI's decision to sell its lighting business to
Investcorp, a Bahrain international investment bank, for Pounds 162m,
especially against the backround of an otherwise dull leisure sector. The
shares gained 25 at 920p - the company's first break ever through 900p - as
1.3m shares changed hands.
Traders saw the move as a step closer to Thorn's presumed goal of discarding
periferals to leave the company with two core businesses, music and rentals.
Thorn has sold about 60 firms since 1987 and now makes 82 per cent of
profits from music and rentals.
The market ultimately expects to see a demerger but was taken somewhat by
surprise by the long-expected move, which has been little discussed in
recent weeks.
A generally sluggish banks sector provided a bright spot in TSB, which moved
to an all-time high of 198p before finishing a net 2 up at 197p ahead of
interim figures scheduled for Thursday.
TSB is the first of the clearing banks to report their half-year numbers,
with Lloyds Bank due to follow at the end of next month.
Analysts' interim profits forecasts extend from around Pounds 50m to as high
as Pounds 130m, compared with last time's Pounds 92m, with provisioning
against bad debts expected to show an increase on the previous year's first
half but a fall on the second half's figure. NatWest Securities is
forecasting a 5 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 3.3p.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 19m shares after the board disclosed
losses that were lower than the market expected.
US selling early in the session prompted a decline in the shares to 96p, a
fall that was reversed with the release of the figures. However, analysts'
concern about steel overcapacity in the EC took hold in the afternoon,
bringing a further decline in the stock, which closed a touch harder on the
day at 98 3/4 p.
Shares in Rolls-Royce shed 2 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after trade of 5.5m on fears
that development costs for its new Trent-800 engine may be higher than
expected.
Worries about overcapacity in European steel also hurt ASW Holdings, which
gave up 8 to 205p.
Weekend press comment boosted Aerospace Engineering by 2 to 28p. Unconfirmed
talk of a broker's profits upgrading for BTR saw the shares advance 12 to
368p.
Grand Metropolitan moved up 12 to 426p on 6.7m shares traded ahead of an
analysts meeting. Analysts said the company continued to benefit from last
week's brokers' advice to sell Guinness in favour of GrandMet.
Food manufacturers were mostly firm, with Tate &amp; Lyle up 6 at 381p on news
that a strike at one of its American factories was over. Hillsdown, the
poultry to upholstery group, bucked the market trend to finish 5 off at 136p
United Biscuits, still riding a bid rumour, finished 8 higher at 408p. Once
again Cadbury Schweppes was tipped as the chief suspect.
The shares of bananas importer Geest continued to slide on traders' nerves
over the future of the European Community's banana regime, now the subject
of an inquiry by a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). The stock ended 10 cheaper at 344p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Reuters had reached its initial target of executing an average
1,000 trades a day on its Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange trading system
triggered a flurry of strong support for the shares as some analysts adopted
the view that the new system has established clear marketing leadership
within the lucrative forex market. Reuters rose 16 to 1347p on turnover of
almost 1m shares.
'We believe it is possible for Reuters to achieve a 10 per cent market share
in forex, which is now a highly profitable growth market,' said Mr Brian
Newman, electronics analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroker.
The Henderson analyst said he believed Reuters had left the international
opposition in forex dealings systems far behind. Volume carried out by
Minex, controlled by a consortium of Japanese banks, was mostly sourced in
Japan, while the start-up of the EBS system, run by a consortium including
Telerate, had been delayed to September.

<TEXT>
Both classes of Zeneca shares eased 4 to 618p, with activity concentrated in
the 'old' stock, where turnover reached 3.9m. The Pounds 1.3bn rights issue,
at 600p a share, closed yesterday and the easier trend in the stock price
was attributed to expectations that any stock not taken up by holders will
be placed in the market by the brokers to the issue.
Fisons, on the other hand, extended the recent outstanding performance, with
the shares closing a net 5 1/2 up at 177p after heavy turnover of 8.2m.
Specialists attributed the spectacular outperformance of the stock - up from
a low of 147p only a couple of weeks ago - to the recent approval of Tilade
by the US authorities.
Amersham jumped to 775p xd after the US Food and Drug Administration
approved the company's Metastron drug.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst individual performance in the FT-SE 100 Index came from Wellcome,
whose shares fell 3.4 per cent after being hit by a series of bearish
developments.
These included the cancellation of a clinical study of one of its drugs,
Flolan, which dragged down a share price already burdened by worries about
litigation over Wellcome's Aids drug Retrovir and press comment detailing
criticism of Wellcome's herpes drug Zovirax. Another factor helping to
depress the shares was a downgrading of the drugs sector by Kidder Peabody,
one of the leading US brokerages, last Friday night.
Wellcome shares dropped to 702p at one point before stabilising and closing
a net 25 down at 705p, the lowest closing level since April 19. Turnover of
4.6m was well above usual levels of activity.
Commenting on the barrage of bad news, one leading analyst said: 'The Flolan
news is unhelpful but not particularly bad, while there is nothing new in
the other stories.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in NIE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN KEEPING with other privatisation issues, Northern Ireland Electricity
(NIE) got off to a better than expected start, the shares opening at 125p,
five to six points higher than had generally been expected, according to
senior marketmakers, and maintaining their early momentum. NIE is the last
of the electricity companies to be privatised.
The stock price quickly moved up to touch 130p, before settling at 126 1/2
p. Turnover in NIE, easily the highest in the market yesterday, reached 51m
shares.
Dealers said the strong performance by the shares reflected the recent good
showing of the utilities sectors in the stock market, particularly the power
generators, which have recently been hitting all-time highs after announcing
results above expectations and raising hopes of bumper dividend payouts.
The regional electricity companies have recently begun to announce
preliminary results, the three companies reporting so far unveiling dividend
increases of 14 to 15 per cent.
There was evidence that some institutions, unable to acquire sufficiently
high weightings in NIE, decided to take the hefty premium offered and sell
their allocations. Others, however, were said to have been aggressive buyers
of NIE, and determined to reach target weightings.
The first day premium on NIE is similar to those achieved by the water
stocks, the 'recs' and the power generators. The Scottish generators enjoyed
much smaller initial premiums.

FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REDUCTION in interest rates in two European countries fuelled
speculation of a similar move in the UK, leading to an advance in stock
index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
On its first full day as market leader, the September contract on the FT-SE
100 opened at 2,896, well below Friday's strong finish. However, hopes of a
cut in UK base rates attracted buyers to the contract, sending it sharply
ahead. It not only established a strong premium to the cash market but was
one of the main factors in pulling equity prices higher.
While non-EC trade figures released later were greeted favourably, it was
the announcement shortly after midday of a reduction in interest rates in
France and later Portugal that led to further active buying. The day's high
of 2,933 for the September futures contract was recorded just after
lunchtime.
Leading securities houses used the opportunity to arbitrage between the cash
and futures markets, a factor which contributed to the day's high volume.
September closed at 2,927, some 14 points above the fair value premium to
cash, which now stands at 11 points. Volume was a healthy 10,125 lots.
Turnover in traded options remained uninspiring, at 24,573. British Steel,
which reported figures yesterday, was the most active stock option.

FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index closes above 2,900
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market yesterday regained the Footsie 2,900 territory last
seen more than three months ago, helped by strength in dollar earning stocks
and a good lead from stock index futures. Base rate hopes remained high
following interest rate cuts in Europe and optimism appeared undimmed by
unfavourable money supply figures from Germany.
The closing reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 2,903.4, the best of the day
and a net gain of 24 points, was the highest since March 16. The driving
force came from the futures market, where the September contract on the
Footsie, in its first effective day's trading as market leader, climbed to a
premium of 30 points to the underlying cash market.
This sparked successive bursts of basket trading as leading securities
houses played between cash and futures - selling futures contracts and
buying the blue chip equities.
With a strong US dollar also encouraging buyers across much of the Footsie
range, the index soon reversed an early loss and broke through the 2,900
barrier at mid-morning. Equities were also helped by strength in long-dated
government bonds.
The market's progress on the first day of the new trading account was by no
means unbroken, however, and it took a fresh spur from stock index futures
to push the Footsie to the best level. The stress on basket trading left the
second line issues relatively neglected, although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
edged up by 2.7 points to a new peak of 3,218.5.
Market strategists pointed to a further set of good economic data on the
economy as the UK trade deficit with non-EC countries came out smaller than
expected. Even the setbacks in Japanese and US equities failed to upset
London; Nick Knight, the ebullient guru at Nomura in London, advised clients
to 'switch Japan into the UK'.
There was no immediate reaction to the latest Gallup survey of UK consumer
confidence conducted on behalf of the European Commission, which suggested
that optimism over the economy may have 'come to an abrupt end'.
London market analysts were impressed by the French decision to cut
intervention rates 'without waiting for a nod from the Bundesbank' and some
believed that wide-ranging changes in the ERM were imminent.
But while the non-EC trade figures, together with last week's statistics on
UK unemployment and inflation, have strengthened hopes that economic
recovery has truly taken hold, some analysts continued to show concern over
the high ratings of the UK stock market.
'Equities are still trying to have their cake and eat it,' observed Mr Rob
Buckland at NatWest Securities.
Seaq volume of 570.4m shares compared with Friday's total of 712.5m, worth
Pounds 1.43bn in retail activity. Non-Footsie business made up around 63 per
cent of yesterday's total, with trading boosted by at least one trading
programme in the second half of the session.
Among the features of the day were the final dealings in the rights issue
from Zeneca, in a pharmaceuticals sector gaining little benefit from the
strength of the dollar. First dealings in Northern Ireland Electricity
established the expected premium.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on higher bonds
and dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices staged a modest rally yesterday as equities, aided by firmer
bonds and a stronger dollar, rebounded from last Friday's futures and
options-related losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.05 ahead at 3,510.82,
near its peak for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 2.54 higher at 446.22, but the Nasdaq composite was down 0.85 at
688.74. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 223.6m shares and
rises outnumbered declines by 1,124 to 818.
Last week ended with a steep loss on the Dow, incurred because of selling
linked to the monthly expiration of stock and stock index futures and
options, an event known as 'triple-witching'. Consequently, prices bounced
back at the opening yesterday in the traditional post-triple-witching rally,
with the Dow gaining 16 points in the first few minutes of trading.
Stocks, however, were unable to hold on to those gains and by early
afternoon, prices were either unchanged or, in the case of secondary issues,
firmly anchored in negative territory. Later in the day the market righted
itself once again, supported by a solid rise in bond prices - the benchmark
30-year bond rose half a point, in the process pushing the yield down to
6.77 per cent. Bonds were cheered by positive remarks about inflation from a
senior Federal Reserve official.
The Dow was aided in its recovery by a sharp turnround in Caterpillar
shares, which had fallen sharply in early trading, depressing the markets'
leading average. In spite of yesterday's gains, some analysts believe the
markets may have already settled into a narrow trading pattern for the
summer, and a period of relatively subdued activity.
Caterpillar initally fell more than Dollars 5 to Dollars 72 in hectic
trading after the company warned that its non-US business was weakening.
Later in the session, however, the price rallied to end a net Dollars 1 1/2
down at Dollars 75 3/4 on turnover of 1.1m shares.
Tambrands jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 in heavy trading on reports
that the board is considering selling the company, which at the start of
trading yesterday had a market value of about Dollars 1.6bn. One of the
companies named as a possible buyer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, saw its shares slip
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 .
Nike plunged Dollars 9 1/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 as investors got the first real
chance to react to Friday's news, announced after the market had closed,
that the sportswear maker expects its earnings for the year ending in May
1994 to fall significantly short of market expectations. The warning led to
a series of ratings downgrades by Wall Street brokers, further pummelling
the share price.
Reebok, Nike's main rival in the competitive sports shoe market, dipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 29 3/8 in sympathy.
Canada
TORONTO price movements were mixed after a fair turnover. The TSE 300 index
ended 15.5 up at 3,922.4 but declines narrowly led advances by 358 to 351.
Volume totalled 55.5m shares valued at CDollars 612m.
Eleven of the 14 stock groups finished higher, the paper and forest products
group leading with a rise of 1.55 per cent.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political uncertainty
leaves Nikkei 3% weaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL uncertainty left share prices down 3 per cent and at their lowest
level for four months, as reformists in the ruling Liberal Democratic party
poised themselves to launch their own political groups, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 592.11, the largest day's fall of the year, at
19,212.43. The index opened at the day's best of 19,742.40 and dropped to a
low of 19,039.55 in afternoon trading on selling by foreign institutions and
individuals.
Volume totalled 340m shares, against Friday's 253m. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities said that apart from squaring of positions by short-term traders,
most investors remained on the sidelines. 'People are not sure what to do,'
he added.
Losers overwhelmed gainers by 1,044 to 52, with 31 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks declined for the sixth consecutive
day, shedding 56.04 to 1,531.28, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
up 0.61 to 1,174.62.
Bonds and the yen were also weaker. The dollar closed Y3.08 higher at
Y110.48, while the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.38 to 106.91. Mr
Souichi Enkyo, an economist at Bank of Tokyo, said the risks of holding the
yen would increase sharply until the Tokyo summit at the beginning of next
month.
NTT, the benchmark for market sentiment, plunged Y79,000 to Y831,000. Margin
traders, who faced additional margin requirements as the share price
declined, were seen liquidating holdings.
Receding hopes of credit easing due to the weaker dollar pushed down
large-capital shares and financials. Nippon Steel fell Y18 to Y362 while
Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y2,820.
Brokerage issues were the hardest hit, the sector falling 6.7 per cent.
Nomura Securities lost Y90 to Y1,920 and Nikko Securities Y80 to Y960.
Some consumer electronics shares posted gains thanks to the dollar's
strength. Sony put on Y50 at Y4,410 and TDK Y10 at Y3,750. However, heavy
electricals weakened on profit-taking, Hitachi retreating Y33 to Y794 and
Toshiba Y8 to Y688.
In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 786.55 to 21,167.54 in volume of 20.7m
shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of Pacific Rim markets took a lead from Tokyo. Jakarta and Kuala
Lumpur were closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG slid by 2.7 per cent as the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ended
a first day of talks on the colony's future with no comment on progress. The
Hang Seng index closed at the day's low, down 197.17 at 7,003.58.
Cheung Kong and its affiliate, Hutchison, met the strongest selling
pressure, falling 80 cents and 70 cents to HKDollars 26.80 and HKDollars
20.50 respectively.
Semi-Tech added 40 cents at HKDollars 16 in spite of last Friday's
announcement that it will pay Dollars 93m to settle a legal dispute.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index edged down 3.8 to 1,726.6 in a turnover of
ADollars 183.5m.
Against the trend, News Corp rose afresh by 10 cents to ADollars 7.60 on
reports that it will be a shareholder in the float of the Seven Network.
Advance Bank closed 4 cents lower at ADollars 8.05 after rumours that it
might buy State Bank of New South Wales. Commonwealth Bank firmed 3 cents to
end at ADollars 8.43.
TAIWAN finished lower across the board and the weighted index shed 40.53 to
4,074.37 in thin turnover of TDollars 13.8bn.
Financial stocks were among the hardest hit, with Cathay Insurance down
TDollars 3 to TDollars 156 and First Commercial Bank losing TDollars 2.50 to
TDollars 142.
MANILA continued to consolidate, with much of the buying interest focused on
new company issues. The composite index finished 3.95 softer at 1,573.91.
BOMBAY managed to erase much of an early sharp fall as state-owned financial
institutions and mutual funds became buyers late in the day. The BSE index
finished 7.80 down at 2,218.88.
The early decline was triggered by unsubstantiated rumours that Mr Harshad
Mehta, the central figure in a Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal, would
produce evidence to support his allegations that he paid Rp10m to Prime
Minister PV Narasimha Rao.
KARACHI's pharmaceuticals rose on press reports of decontrol of medicine
prices and financials gained on institutional buying, as the KLSE index
gained 20.27 at 1,225.82.
SEOUL gained ground in moderate trading, with buying focused on shares with
low price-earnings ratios, financials and vehicle issues.
The composite index closed 5.86 stronger at 766.06.
COLOMBO saw demand for banks as the CSE all-share index moved forward 19.75
to 615.32 in a turnover of Rs68.2m. National Development Bank forged ahead
Rs32.75 to Rs172.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate manoeuvres lift
Paris and Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate cuts lifted Paris and Amsterdam yesterday and, coming towards
the close in Belgium, they are expected to do the same for Brussels today,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS got its ninth interest rate cut since mid-April and the CAC-40 index
rose 18.88 to 1,929.17. In spite of some caution ahead of annual meetings
due this week, dealers felt that most bad company news was already in share
prices.
Volume was FFr2.94bn. Elf Aquitaine rose FFr10.50, or 2.8 per cent to
FFr385.40 after losses last week. Peugeot, with a shareholders' meeting
coming up this week, was also among the biggest winners with a gain of 2.5
per cent as it rose FFr13 to FFr530.
Other big wins included Credit Local de France, up FFr9 to FFr416. Rhone
Poulenc A shares fell, by a token FFr1 to FFr537, although the company said
that it would sell its 35 per cent stake in Roussel Uclaf, its associated
pharmaceutical company, for about FFr4.5bn. Roussel itself was suspended at
FFr575.
AMSTERDAM picked up as the day progressed in response to lower interest
rates and the firm dollar and the CBS Tendency index added 0.9 to 110.1.
A 10-basis point cut to 6.90 per cent in the Dutch special advances rate
came as little surpise to the market but was seen as opening the way for a
broader easing of official bank lending rates.
Royal Dutch hit a 12-month closing high of Fl 175.90, up 20 cents, as early
US demand triggered more widespread buying. Currency considerations helped
Unilever Fl 3 higher to Fl 201.50 and Philips by 50 cents to Fl 28.10.
FRANKFURT ended the official session only slightly higher, the DAX index
closing 2.92 higher at 1,689.82 but, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, it put on another 8 points in the post bourse.
The post bourse saw the publication of a German M3 growth figure of 6.7 per
cent for May after a revised 7 per cent for April. Analysts felt that the
figure, at least, was moving in the right direction.
However, there were other features on the day. The strength of the dollar
brought improvement to the cyclicals, BMW and Volkswagen rising DM6 to
DM495, and DM5.40 to DM348 in carmakers and BASF by DM2.60 to DM237.80 in
chemicals.
In Bonn, the economics minister Mr Gunter Rexrodt, said that Germany's
corporate tax structure could be reformed without a reduction in tax
write-off allowances, opening the way for a compromise on the government's
tax reform plans.
In Munich, Mr Edmund Stoiber, the new premier of Bavaria, said that he wants
to push through the privatisation of state holdings, including that in the
58 per cent owned energy group Bayernwerk, as soon as possible. Viag, linked
with Bayernwerk through cross-shareholdings, rose DM2.50 to DM362.50.
MILAN continued in volatile mood, again taking its lead from renewed falls
for Ferruzzi and Montedison.
The Comit index shed 2.27 to 525.70, but Ferruzzi fell L60.40 or 9 per cent
to L601.0 and Montedison dipped L45 to fix at L894, before L865 after hours.
Investors reacted sceptically to the appointments of Mr Guido Rossi as
chairman of the two companies, and Mr Enrico Bondi as chief executive. There
was also a view that the recovery in their share prices at the end of last
week had been overdone. The renewed weakness spilled over into creditor
banks. Credito Italiano fell L101 or 3.7 per cent to L2,597; BCI lost L174
or 3.3 per cent to L4,965.
The re-emergence of market rumours that Fiat planned an international
alliance or major asset sale took the shares L212 ahead to fix at a day's
high of L6,190 before they eased back to L6,100 on the kerb.
ZURICH took advantage of the strong dollar and shares ended at an all-time
high. The SMI index rose 11.5 to 2,329.5.
Nestle reversed early small losses to add SFr7 to SFr1,130 while Roche
certificates rose SFr85 to SFr4,900.
VIENNA's ATX index rose 9.1 to 848.09 in heavy trading, driven higher by
strong gains in Creditanstalt preferred on rumours that the bank would
publish improved first half results. Creditanstalt preferred gained Sch25 to
Sch594, and were quoted higher still in the post-bourse.
ISTANBUL closed at its eighth record high this month as the market index
soared 679.6 or 6.5 per cent to 11,140.4.
The continued optimism followed expectations that talks between the True
Path Party and the Social Democrat Populist Party to establish a new
coalition government could soon be finalised.
The market also welcomed weekend press reports that the prime
minister-designate, Mrs Tansu Ciller, would insist on strict enforcement of
economic measures, including rapid privatisation, to revitalise the economy.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Japanese equities lead the world lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>

Japanese equities led the world lower last week, a 4.1 per cent drop in
Tokyo leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index 1.5 per cent down in local
currency terms.
The fall was worse in terms of the dollar, at 7.0 per cent, as political and
economic worries mounted and the yen, too, reversed its recent strength.
However, this decline still left the market with a gain of 36.8 per cent in
dollar terms this year, compared with a 19.8 per cent rise via the yen.
Last week's mounting political crisis in Japan culminated after hours on
Friday when Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was forced to dissolve
the lower house of the Japanese parliament and call a snap general election
after his humiliation in a no-confidence vote.
Yesterday's further falls, however, also reflected more broadly based
bearishness. On Thursday, Mr Nicholas Knight and his strategy team at Nomura
in London, who called the upturn in the market last year, reduced the Tokyo
market to underweight.
The Nomura team are increasingly concerned that Tokyo has already entered
its second consolidation phase. 'This,' they say, 'could last the remainder
of the year and see the Nikkei back below 18,000.' The Nikkei's high this
year was 21,076.00, less than three weeks ago.
Mr Knight says that the yen has been much stronger than his team originally
anticipated, hitting exports, and with no offsetting cut in the discount
rate; long bond yields have risen substantially; and, finally, he has been
converted to the cause of the US equity market, forecasting that the Dow
will break significantly above 4,000 later this year, compared with last
Friday's 3,494.77.
In Europe, Spain performed well. In decline a week earlier, following the
Socialist election victory, Madrid took heart at the prospect of stable
government and at last Friday's hints of another cut in interest rates.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Ignoring Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL European central banks took advantage of the D-Mark's weakness in
the exchange rate mechanism yesterday and cut their official interest rates,
writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank has not lowered any of its official interest rates for nearly
six weeks. But as the D-Mark comes under pressure because of Germany's
growing economic and budgetary problems, European central banks have taken
the opportunity to push short-term rates below German levels.
By far the most important round of policy easing has
UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993
been by the authorities in France, who must have been especially concerned
by yesterday's news that French industrial production dropped 5.2 per cent
in the year to April.
The Bank of France yesterday pushed its intervention rate below the level of
the German discount rate floor, cutting it by 25 basis points to 7 per cent.
The central bank's 5 to 10-day lending rate came down by a similar amount to
8 per cent.
The move helped to push French three-month money down some 20 basis points
on the bid side from 7.05 per cent to 6.85 per cent. This in turn widened
the spread between German and French cash to some 50 basis points, as German
rates remained more or less unchanged.
Similar cuts occurred across Europe yesterday. The Dutch and Belgian central
banks trimmed their advances rate and central rate respectively by 10 basis
points to 6.90 per cent. The guilder had been threatening to fall outside
the Dutch central bank's self-imposed 50 basis points fluctuation band
against the D-Mark in the ERM.
Portugal also reduced its intervention rate, by 0.25 percentage points to 11
per cent.
Dealers in sterling markets were rather more bullish about the prospects for
a base rate cut in the UK following newspaper speculation at the weekend
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new UK chancellor, would reduce base rates by
1/2 percentage point this summer.
The September short sterling contract rose 10 basis points to close at 94.19
on fairly heavy volume.
In the cash market, three-month money was about  1/8 percentage point lower
at 5 13/16 per cent. This was in spite of some difficulty removing a Pounds
1.45bn shortage, which left some Pounds 310m of late assistance.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/DM at a 21-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday consolidated Friday's powerful upward move against the
D-Mark, touching its highest level against the German currency since October
1991 before falling back amid profit-taking, writes James Blitz.
There was no important news affecting the fortunes of the dollar in European
or US trading yesterday. But, amid economic weakness in Germany and a
serious political crisis in Japan, the dollar is being courted by
institutional investors who believe the currency's immediate prospects are
very strong.
After closing on Friday in Europe at DM1.6800, the dollar moved up sharply
in Monday's Asian trading, to peak at DM1.6953 at the start of European
trading.
The currency later fell back against the D-Mark in Europe, partly pushed
down by the figure for May's M3 money supply growth in Germany, which was
somewhat higher than had been expected.
Last week, at least two Bundesbank council members had led the market to
believe that the May figure might fall within the Bundesbank's self-imposed
target for M3 of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent on an annualised basis. In the event,
the figure came in at an annualised 6.7 per cent, leading some market
participants to think that the Bundesbank might not cut its repo rate this
week, increasing the return on D-Mark denominated investments.
The dollar ended at DM1.6890, up nearly a pfennig on the day, and in New
York it finished at DM1.6880.
In spite of the setback, Mr Neil MacKinnon, head of currency research at
Citibank in London, said the current price action was similar to the
dollar's in October of last year, after it had hit an historic low against
the D-Mark. 'That was followed by a 20-pfennig move upwards, and we could be
on the verge of a similar move again,' he added.
The dollar also rose against a yen that has been rocked by the political
tremors enveloping Japan after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's resignation as prime
minister. Dealers pushed the yen down to Y111.10 to the dollar by the
European close after it had traded at around Y110 on Friday night. In New
York yesterday the dollar finished at Y110.50.
The Japanese currency remains well underpinned by the country's massive
trade surplus, although a dealer suggested yesterday that it could soon hit
Y115.
The French franc softened slightly against the D-Mark after the Bank of
France again cut official interest rates. But the retracement was marginal,
and the franc finished at FFr3.360, having penetrated this level earlier in
the day.
Sterling consolidated its strength against the weak D-Mark, closing
unchanged at DM2.5125. But the pound weakened against the powerful dollar,
ending nearly a cent down at Dollars 1.4875. If the trend continues, it will
undermine all thought of a UK base rate cut this summer.

POLAND'S KGHM state-owned copper producer has reported a Zl 1,415bn
(USDollars 81m) net profit for 1992 as output in the first five months of
this year is running 3.4 per cent higher than in the same period last year.
The combine's final results yesterday put KGHM's sales in 1992 at Zl
17,361bn while costs reached Zl 13,639bn. Last year the combine, sited in
western Poland, produced 387,000 tonnes of copper and 914 tonnes of silver.
The first five months of this year have seen copper output reach 171,000
tonnes, 3.4 per cent more than last year, when it rose by 2.3 per cent
despite a six week strike. In 1991, KGHM, where the trade unions are
resisting an attempt to sell a minority stake to foreign investors, reported
a Zl 900bn net profit, equivalent USDollars 82m at the present exchange
rates.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather may reduce Russian
grain harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S 1993 grain harvest may fall below last year's because bad weather
delayed spring sowing in some regions, government officials said, reports
Reuter from Moscow.
'The sowing is almost finished. But in some regions in Siberia and eastern
Russia it is behind schedule because of rains and cold weather,' said Mr
Vladimir Kotov, aide to Mr Vladimir Shcherbak, the first deputy agriculture
minister.
'Due to bad weather, it's possible that the grain harvest in 1993 may be
slightly below 1992 levels,' he said. 'Early autumn rains may cause damage
in some areas but it's too early to say.'
Russia harvested 106.8m tonnes of grain in 1992, when imports were 26m
tonnes. Imports in 1993 were forecast sharply lower at 16m tonnes by Mr
Alexander Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, last
week.
Mr Kotov said it was too early to forecast this year's yield. There was an
acute shortage of fertilisers, he added, but Russia had enough diesel and
aviation fuel for crop-spraying aircraft.
Mr Kotov dismissed reports that up to five million hectares of farmland
could be damaged by the worst locust invasion in five decades. 'Locusts are
not a threat this year,' he said. 'We are not concerned.'
He estimated the winter grain harvest this year at about 40m tonnes,
compared with 42.1m tonnes in 1992.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: European zinc producers plan
co-ordinated cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPERATE EUROPEAN zinc producers are hoping to implement a co-ordinated
industry scheme where one or two of them will permanently close smelting
capacity and the rest of the EC industry will provide cash to cover the
closure costs.
At present 18 European zinc smelters, one third of the world total, chase
the same raw materials and the same customers. Analysts have been suggesting
for months that the long-term outlook for them is grim and that some will
have to close.
The industry apparently agrees with this prognosis and a dossier about the
so-called voluntary closure scheme is being prepared for the European
Commission, which must give its approval. The commission is expected to give
the go-ahead because it approved a similar scheme for the European zinc
industry in the early 1980s. There were long discussions then, and also in
the mid-1980s, during which potential closure candidates were identified by
the industry. But market conditions improved and the scheme was quietly
allowed to lapse.
Industry executives said yesterday that a dossier for the commission should
be ready as soon as the European summer holidays were over. There would then
be industry discussions about which smelters should close and how much per
tonne of annual output the rest of the industry should pay if they did shut
down. In the 1980s smelters in Germany, southern Italy, Spain and the UK
were on the short list for closure.
Zinc's anti-corrosion properties are used mainly for galvanised steel for
the automotive and construction industries. Pressure is building up on
producers because prices are near their all-time lows and demand is weak,
particularly in Europe where recession in Germany is biting hard.
One observer made it clear, however, that the industry was not unanimous.
'Is this the right way to stimulate rationalisation of the European
industry? Would not that rationalisation happen anyway?' he asked.
Mr David Humphreys, economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest
mining group, said recently that European zinc smelters, which mainly buy in
their raw materials and have no associated mines of their own, would suffer
because of both the quantity and the quality of zinc concentrate (an
intermediate material) likely to be available in the second half of the
1990s.
He said there were already indications that a combination of very low prices
for zinc metal and very high treatment charges for concentrates would lead
to cuts in mine production and investment so severe as to leave the market
short of concentrates in the latter part of the decade.
A number of mines would be exhausted in the 1990s and there was only one
large-scale zinc mining project at present fully committed; MIM's Dollars
200m McArthur River project in the Northern Territory of Australia.
As for the quality of the concentrate, Mr Humphreys pointed out that two of
the three new smelters being planned would use the so-called Imperial
Smelting Process and a substantial part of the proposed increase in mine
capacity was for bulk (mixed lead-zinc) concentrates usable only at ISP
plants. Potentially this added to pressures on non-integrated electrolytic
zinc plants which required clean zinc concentrates. 'This, together with
falling domestic mine production, would point to further problems for
Europe's custom smelters.'
Mr Humphreys added: 'More zinc smelter production cuts are urgently needed.
Exchange rates and the condition of the domestic market suggest that cuts
will need to be in Europe'.
The Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group was also
pessimistic about the zinc industry's future in a recent report - 'Zinc's
structural surplus: Temporary or long-term blight?' It suggested production
capacity would remain well above demand until at least the end of 1996 and
that zinc prices would be weak compared with those of the medium-term past -
even when present huge stocks of concentrate and metal had been
substantially reduced.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pressure builds up in aluminium
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ONLY a matter of time before the aluminium market succumbs to renewed
downward pressure on prices, suggests Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group.
'Demand remains poor, stocks continue to accumulate and still producers are
demonstrating a strong reluctance to respond to calls for further hefty cuts
in production,' says Mr Angus MacMillan, Billiton's research manager.
Outlining in Billiton's latest weekly Metals Report those aluminium
production cuts already announced, Mr MacMillan points out that the only
recent addition to the total has been the closure of a second
45,000-tonnes-a-year pot line at Alusuisse's smelter in Germany. This
follows the closure of a first pot line in March of last year.
On the other hand, Columbia Aluminium in the US has restarted 17,000 tonnes
of annual capacity at its Goldendale smelter, citing cash flow problems, and
Spain's Inespal, after long talks with the unions, decided not to cut
production or close either its Aviles or La Coruna smelters. Such moves
could have resulted in the loss of about 73,000 tonnes of capacity. Instead
it is to cut its workforce by about one third between 1994 and 1997.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Delegates optimistic on timber
pact

NEGOTIATIONS ON a new International Tropical Timber Agreement resumed in
Geneva yesterday, with both producing and consuming countries expressing
optimism for progress in the week-long talks.
The first session of talks in April ended in stalemate over producer demands
for temperate and boreal, as well as tropical timber, to be included in the
new agreement. Producing countries, the biggest being Malaysia, Indonesia,
Ivory Coast, Papua New Guinea and Brazil, say the present accord is
discriminatory.
The 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement, which came into force in
1985 and expires in March next year, aims to balance economic use of
tropical timber with environmental needs through co-operation, consultation
and research. It has no price-setting mechanisms.
Consumers have pressed for stronger environmental provisions, including a
clear commitment to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical timber
exports come from sustainably managed forests. Producers do not want this
target to be legally binding and say similar commitments should be imposed
on all internationally traded timber.
Consumer countries continue to oppose the inclusion of temperate and boreal
timber in any agreement.
At a meeting of the International Tropical Timber Council in Kuala Lumpur
last month, however, they proposed three points for discussion in Geneva
which they hope will allay producer concerns.
In particular, consumers have suggested language in the new agreement that
would bar discrimination against exports of tropical timber as such and
ensure the accord could not be used to justify trade curbs.
Consumers have also offered to examine a shift to sustainable forest
management for temperate timber and increased funds for projects in tropical
producing countries to promote sustainable management and increased market
transparency.
The negotiations, sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, involve some 50 countries accounting for virtually the whole
Dollars 7.5bn a year trade in tropical timber. Unctad officials say that a
final deal is unlikely this time.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Giving
African farm aid a feminine touch - In Tanzania the women till the soil
while the men concentrate on weightier matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAMA FLORA Yrafay is one of the leaders of her community. She lives in a mud
hut in the village of Dareda in the district of Babati in Tanzania. Her age,
I estimate, is about 25 and she has five children under seven years of age.
The aid worker who introduced this lady to me last week described her as a
'mover and shaker' and influential in persuading her neighbours to adopt new
farming ideas. For women, I was told, were the real farmers in this part of
Africa. The men tend to sit around most of the time discussing great issues
and drinking locally distilled gin. Their wives till the soil, plant and
harvest the crops and milk the goats, as well as cooking meals and rearing a
large brood of children.
That is why Farm Africa, a British-based charity is targeting women in this
densely populated area. If they can persuade them to adopt more efficient
methods of food production, the charity reasons, their activities will have
the greatest overall effect on the well-being of children and the whole
community.
The methods used by Farm Africa are basic. Firstly it tries to establish
what the women themselves need, which sounds obvious but is radically
different from the approach of some other aid agencies. Many major charities
have the reputation of imposing on poor communities massive 'improvement'
schemes that may be alien to local culture and therefore destined for
failure. Farm Africa starts at grassroots.
In Dareda it has been established that the small herds of goats owned by
most families are not only grossly inefficient for both milk and meat
production but, as they roam the village, usually tended by children, are
also denuding the area of vegetation and trees. Goats are widely recognised
as destructive animals because of their indiscriminate grazing habits.
Farm Africa is therefore recommending to the women that they erect small
huts for their goats and keep them confined all the time. The feed is then
cut and carried to them by a system called, in more advanced agricultural
societies, zero grazing.
The paradox is that animal welfarists in the west condemn such systems for
limiting the movement of the animals. In Tanzania, however, the priorities
are different and damage to the environment leading to lack of food for the
future together with associated erosion of the soil are seen as the most
important considerations.
Alongside this changed system of goat keeping Farm Africa has introduced
British-bred female goats which give five to six pints of milk a day, three
to four times as much as the native nannies. This is a quantum leap in
production and although the number of British Toggenbergs in Dareda is so
far only about 30 females and one male the effect on those who have them has
been dramatic.
Children are better nourished by the larger quantities of rich milk and the
superior goats give the families a feeling of greater wealth. But Farm
Africa is anxious to spread these benefits as widely as possible and insist
that after one lactation each Toggenberg female is passed on to another
family leaving the first owner with the young goat it has just produced.
In addition the billy goat is made available for a fee of about Pounds 2 to
mate with the local village females. A service fee for goats was unheard of
until Farm Africa arrived but such is the perceived improvement in potential
production from the cross breeding that the billy is kept very busy.
The initiative also advocates a programme of tree planting and has developed
a simple but more efficient stove for cooking. In the past this has been
done on open fires, which burn a great deal of wood. This too has led to the
cutting of large areas of trees and there has previously been little attempt
to replant. All over Tanzania the heavy downfalls of the rainy season has
gouged great channels through the unprotected red soils and washed the
aluvium down the rivers.
So the combination of the fuel-efficient clay stoves, moulded and made by
women like Mama Flora Yrafay and sold to others for a little over Pounds 1
each and the tree planting programme will in time help to control the
erosion.
Another aspect of Farm Africa's initiative is to encourage farmers, in other
words the women of the community, to use oxen to relieve some of their
burdens. At present most land work and water carrying is done by hand or
head and on foot. Tractors are far too expensive and hi-tech, so oxen are
the appropriate compromise.
Groups of co-operating women are being encouraged to take out interest-free
loans from Farm Africa with which to purchase two or four oxen together with
basic equipment like a plough, a weeder and a cart.
All these improvements are also being disseminated through the local
government-employed extension service - one man who, lacking any other means
of transport, has to walk from farm to farm over a vast area - and through
the schools.
As would be expected in a country where it is normal for families to have
between five and ten children the schools are teeming with pupils. But they
too have few resources and it is not unusual to find a ratio of one teacher
to 90 or a 100 children.
The schools do, however, usually have a few acres of land - as food
production is the most crucial subject children can study. Time spent at
this level, says Farm Africa, is a vital investment in the future.
But the scale of the problem of rural poverty in Tanzania is immense. Of its
23m people it is estimated that 90 per cent are involved in agriculture -
usually at subsistence level or worse. The population of the country is
increasing at about 3 per cent each year and 50 per cent of Tanzanians are
under 14 years of age.
The socialist government, which has owned all the land since nationalisation
in 1974 but is just beginning a modest programme of privatisation, claims
there is plenty of land for the next generation. But there certainly is not
enough in districts such as Babati and villages like Dareda.
Each family has just 2 acres allocated by the government and to split these
tiny holdings among the next generation would make subsistence for a family
impossible. The answer, says the Tanzanian government, is to relocate to
other areas of the country where the population is less dense.
But the reasons so many are concentrated around Dareda is because it is a
good farming area with relatively reliable rainfall. Conversely, the reason
other areas are under-populated is because the land is poor and the rain
unreliable.
Clearly population control is an urgent priority. But the culture of the
people is such that large families are seen as security for old age and
there appears little inclination to tackle such a delicate subject.
My farmers' assessment of the food supply situation in Tanzania is that it
is a disaster waiting to happen. Poverty breeds population and wealth is
denied to all but those who exploit the system. Corruption is admitted to be
rife at all levels of government and business.
Given the size of the problem Farm Africa's efforts seem puny. But at least
it is starting at the right level and the tiny area in which it operates is
already beginning to benefit from its efforts.

London COCOA prices continued last week's rally as the September contract
climbed towards Pounds 750 a tonne. New York's higher opening provoked a
spurt of buying interest in London in the afternoon, but traders attribute
the recent break-out mainly to technical factors. London robusta COFFEE
prices lost further ground in the afternoon as the market drifted back in
line with New York. Earlier hopes that prices might attempt to edge higher
faded quickly as New York opened lower. Both markets continued to disregard
talk of retention schemes among Latin American producers. 'How many times
have we heard this before? Anything that starts from outside an
international coffee agreement never takes off,' one trader said. On the LME
three-month COPPER was unable to hold above Dollars 1,900 a tonne after
advancing in early trading. But dealers said a further attempt is likely
today. Three-month ALUMINIUM was unable to reach the Dollars 1,215 a tonne
target, easing from its highs on the kerb with copper, but remaining
technically constructive. GOLD futures were trading near session lows at
midday on Comex.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: French rate cut prompts concern over
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISE cut in French short-term interest rates yesterday set the
European government bond market alight as economists became increasingly
concerned for Germany's position as Europe's currency anchor.
Analysts said the French repo on Friday had not signalled a quarter-point
cut in the key intervention rate and it was only yesterday morning that the
market began to scent the possibility of an easing.
Nevertheless, government bond investors took the cut well and after a brief
bout of profit-taking, the September futures contract on the Matif rallied
to close 0.26 points higher at 119.36.
In the cash market, the 10-year French OAT-German bund yield spread narrowed
still further. The spread moved from 15 basis points at the end of last week
to only 10 basis points at the close of trading yesterday, with some
economists predicting parity within the next few months.
The crossover of French and German rates has now moved sharply along the
yield curve, with French five-year rates conclusively below their German
equivalent and seven year rates hitting parity.
GERMAN government paper suffered from growing currency worries and
disappointing money supply figures.
Bund futures for September fell 22 basis points at one stage as the
Bundesbank reported that M3 money supply growth had grown at a seasonally
adjusted annualised rate of 6.7 per cent in May, the top end of the target
range.
Bunds were also under pressure from the continued strength of the dollar
against the D-Mark, which is seen as undermining the Bundesbank's desire to
ease monetary policy.
September futures rallied to close 8 basis points lower at 95.27.
IN THE UK, gilts were helped by the French rate cut and the overspill from
last week's encouraging financial data.
Government bond futures jumped from 105.23 to 106.06, consolidating last
week's surge that followed news of inflation hitting a 33-year low.
Short-dated bonds were slightly firmer, but a rise in short sterling was
principally attributed to a bounce following aggressive selling at the end
of last week. Sunday newspaper comments that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new
chancellor of the exchequer, was poised to announce a half-point cut in
interest rates ahead of the Christchurch by-election were discounted. 'Most
of the Christchurch electorate are holders of net assets - an interest cut
would not be very tactical,' said one economist.
PORTUGUESE government bonds rose sharply after a 25 basis point cut in the
Bank of Portugal's key money rates sparked interest rate cuts across the
board.
The reduction was a further signal of the ability of European central banks
to cut rates independently of those in Germany. The intervention rate easing
sparked a fall in money rates across the board. Overnight money eased to 12
per cent from 12.25 per cent on Friday and all Libor interbank rates slipped
below 13 per cent.
FUTURES-led buying lifted longer-dated US Treasuries as the short end of the
market readied itself for a sizeable infusion of fresh supply.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 104
1/2 , yielding 6.768 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.124 per cent.
Most of the activity was confided to technical trading by dealer accounts,
with long prices rising after the September Treasury bond contact rose
through a key resistance level. Remarks from a senior Federal Reserve
governor that he was encouraged by the recent inflation data, the dollar's
rally, and good news on the progress of President Bill Clinton's
deficit-reduction package through Congress also gave longer-dated securities
a boost.
Retail investors, meanwhile, were mostly absent from the market, awaiting
today's sale of Dollars 16bn in two-year notes and tomorrow's sale of
Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. The impending auctions meant that
shorter-dated maturities traded quietly throughout the day.
THE Balladur Bond', the French government's new FFr40bn four-year bond
issue, is to be launched this Friday, raising funds for the country's
economic recovery programme, writes Sara Webb.
French banking sources expect the coupon and commission to be set later this
week. The bonds, which mature on July 16 1997, can be converted into shares
of newly-privatised companies. The conversion rights are open to investors
in France and other EC countries.
Bond analysts expect the coupon to be set at around 6.25 per cent, although
the recent rally in French government bonds fuelled speculation that it may
be set lower.
However, market participants are still anxiously awaiting details of the
bond's conversion rights.
The government has said bondholders will have the right to convert into
shares in newly-privatised companies as the privatisation programme gets
under way.
Subscription for the bond runs from June 25 to July 10.
Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) and Banque Nationale de Paris
(BNP) will be lead managers and Caisse des Depots Et Consignations (CDC)
will be co-lead.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Morocco may return with
sovereign issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MOHAMED Berrada, the finance minister of Morocco, said the country was
likely to re-enter global capital markets shortly with a sovereign bond
issue, Reuter reports.
He said the country was prepared to borrow small amounts at short maturities
in the international markets. He noted, however, that some banks were
bombarding him with requests to bring Moroccan bond deals to market, and
drew a parallel with the 1970s when banks lent money freely to the third
world and ended up with a debt crisis.
'In our strategy, we want to return to the market but I don't want to
increase my external debt. If I want debt, I only want it for private sector
companies,' he said during a visit to New York to promote Morocco among
investors.
Mr Berrada said a small sovereign bond issue would be necessary to get the
ball rolling before private companies returned to the market.
The minister's visit to New York has helped prompt a three-point rally in
the price of Moroccan debt in the secondary market, dealers said.
It is currently trading at 66-3/8 per cent of face value, a discount that Mr
Berrada said was not justified because the country had always serviced its
debt. 'If you want to make very big money very quickly, you buy Moroccan
debt,' he said.
The government is currently considering the possibility of allowing the use
of discounted Moroccan foreign loans in debt-for-equity swaps in the tourism
and agro-export sectors, said Mr Berrada.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Dutch Treasury bond trading
system launched

FIVE foreign banks and brokerage houses have been accepted as special
corporate members of the Amsterdam stock exchange so they can take part in a
new inter-professional trading system for Dutch government bonds that was
officially launched yesterday.
The new Amsterdam Treasury Bond Market (ATM), designed to allow direct
dealing in transactions exceeding Fl 2.5m (Dollars 1.3m), is part of the
Dutch exchange's continuing campaign to win back trading in stocks and bonds
that has seeped away to London.
The next significant step is scheduled for early 1994, when the share
trading system will effectively be split between the wholesale and retail
markets.
The five, mainly London-based foreign members are Goldman Sachs
International, JP Morgan Guarantee Trust, Salomon Brothers International,
Warburg Securities and the UK securities subsidiary of Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The Amsterdam stock exchange said it expected that within the next two weeks
four more foreign banks and brokers would take out a special membership,
costing Fl 40,000, which was needed to give them access to ATM.
Under Amsterdam's new bond trading rules, transactions below Fl 2.5m will
remain the preserve of the central trading system, in which orders must be
channelled and executed through one of two 'hoekman' (or market specialist)
firms in the field of Dutch government bonds, Bondgeest &amp; Springer and Van
Hees.
Under ATM, by contrast, a joint venture between these two 'hoekman' firms,
Bondgeest &amp; Van Hees, will run an order book in the form of a
non-interactive screen and also act as interdealer broker, if required.
Participants can close deals either by using the inter-dealer broker or by
direct trading between institutions.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Mixed response to partly-paid structure
of Tesco Pounds 200m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the UK supermarket chain, launched a Pounds 200m issue with an
unusual partly-paid structure more typically seen in the gilts market, which
met a mixed reaction.
Some dealers said the structure proved a deterrent to some investors,
particularly foreign investors who expect sterling to appreciate.
But lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston argued that the structure
appealed to foreign investors who do not want to take a view on the currency
and to retail investors.
The structure of the deal suited Tesco, which does not need the proceeds
immediately, but wished to take advantage of favourable market conditions.
The 9 1/2 -year deal was launched at a yield spread of 68 basis points over
the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 (or 50 basis points, if the partly paid feature
were stripped out).
Dealers said that there was still strong demand for sterling bonds following
the recent spate of new issues, but investor demand is drawn to either very
high quality paper, or high-yielding paper. Some said that Tesco, rated Aa3
by Moody's, fell into neither of these categories. But CSFB said that with
Eurosterling spreads at historically tight levels, investor interest was
piqued by bonds offering a spread of 50 basis points or more over gilts.
In the dollar market, two companies issued bonds under newly created Euro
medium-term note programmes.
Energie Beheer Nederland, the Dutch state-owned gas production company,
launched a Dollars 300m seven-year deal under its new Dollars 1.5bn
programme, at a spread of 24 basis points. The deal was considered a touch
aggressive, but the borrower's AAA rating and rarity value helped fuel
demand.
A Dollars 250m three-year deal for Sony Capital, the US arm of the Japanese
electronics giant, issued under its new Dollars 1bn Euro MTN programme, was
considered tightly priced at 50 basis points over the comparable Treasury
yield. The company's debt is rated Aa3 by Moody's, but was recently
downgraded by S&amp;P to A. However, lead manager Goldman Sachs said the name
appeals to retail investors. The spread widened to 52 basis points.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nokia posts FM154m recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics and telecommunications group, recovered to a
pre-tax profit of FM154m (Dollars 28.5m) in the first four months from a
loss of FM280m at the same stage last year, following rapid sales growth in
telecommunications and mobile telephones.
A near 80 per cent rise in telecommunications sales to FM125bn and a 109 per
cent increase in mobile phone sales to FM184bn pushed group sales to
FM7.09bn from FM4.86bn.
Europe and eastern Asia accounted for much of the growth with new orders
during the period, including cable TV transmission systems in Britain and
China, a digital cellular telephone network to Germany, and strong demand
for mobile handsets in Germany and Britain.
There was also strong sales growth - 51 per cent - in consumer electronics,
which showed turnover of FM2.38bn due to increased sales of computer
monitors.
But home electronics continued to suffer from weak demand and low prices,
producing what Nokia called a heavy loss for the consumer electronics
division. The cables and machinery business was also hit by continued
recession in Finland and the slow pace of economic development in central
Europe. Sales in this division fell slightly to FM1.36bn.
Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said technological changes, coupled with
strong demand, should sustain sales growth in telecommunications through the
present economic slowdown in Europe. But he said internal cost reductions
were not compensating for the slump in consumer electronics.
Nevertheless, he expected a better full-year return than last year's pre-tax
FM158m loss. 'We are very confident the result will be a significant
improvement this year - but it is very difficult to be more specific in view
of the uncertainties (in the market).'

A CONTROLLED liquidation of Commercial Holding, a leasing and property
investment group, has been agreed by Danish banks, but their British
counterparts have still to approve the plan, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
Share quotations for the group's four companies, Commercial Holding,
Commercial Leasing, Ballin &amp; Herz and Brandt's Klaedefabrik, have been
suspended in Copenhagen since the end of April.
The group's equity capital was a negative DKr617m (Dollars 96m) at the end
of 1992, according to a stock exchange statement, compared with a positive
DKr452m at the start of last year.
Danish creditors have agreed to convert DKr700m of their claims to equity
capital to allow assets to be sold over a period of two years.
But the group has lost about DKr600m through leasing operations in the UK,
and British bank creditors have still to approve the liquidation plan, the
statement said.

<TEXT>
SGS-THOMSON, the Franco-Italian electronic components group, is expected to
muster a significant increase in net profits this year by making net income
of Dollars 100m against Dollars 3m in 1992, according to one of its main
shareholders, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Mr Jean-Francois Saglio, deputy chief executive of CEA-Industrie, the
largest French investor in SGS-Thomson, said the company was on course for
further profits growth in 1993 after returning to the black last year.
SGS-Thomson has already announced net profits of Dollars 24.4m for the first
quarter of 1993, having increased its orders by 91.2 per cent over the same
period of the previous year.

SIEMENS, the German electronics and electrical group, is in talks with the
Austrian government to acquire up to 15 per cent of Austrian Industries
(AI), the state-owned metals and mechanical company, writes Eric Frey in
Vienna.
The transaction, which would be worth as much as Sch3bn (Dollars 256m),
would give AI a badly-needed cash infusion and help cover its losses from
its troubled aluminium subsidiary, AMAG, which last year ran up losses of
Sch9bn.
AI is not stock market listed, but analysts put its value at Sch15bn to
Sch20bn.
This excludes AMAG, which is to be spun off from the main group to make the
remaining steel and engineering activities more attractive for investors.
Beside Siemens, Bank Austria and the insurance group Wiener Staedtische are
interested in taking small stakes in AI. By selling 25 per cent of its
equity capital, AI is hoping to raise up to Sch5bn.
An agreement in principle between AI and Siemens, headed by chief executive
Mr Heinrich von Pierer (pictured), could be ready in the early autumn.
Through its subsidiary Siemens Austria, the German group has traditionally
held close links with Austria's state-owned sector. AI holds a 26 per cent
stake in Siemens Austria.

GROUPE Salomon, one of Europe's leading ski equipment companies, continued
its recovery last year with a 43 per cent increase in net profits to
FFr94.8m (Dollars 16.8m) in the year to March 31 from FFr66.3m in the
previous year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The group, which has been restructured in the two years since the arrival of
a new management team led by Mr Jean-Francois Gautier, said it expected
profits to stabilise this year but to return to growth in 1994-1995 due to
its product development plans.
Salomon fell into the red two years ago after a series of poor skiing
seasons in the Alps. It returned to profit in the 1991-1992 financial year
and made further progress last year.
Turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to FFr3.15bn in 1992-1993 from FFr2.96bn in
1991-1992 with operating profits increasing by 53.6 per cent to FFr312m from
FFr202m.
The group's pre-tax profits doubled to FFr177.28m from FFr86.36m over the
same period.
The board proposed raising the dividend by 75 per cent, by paying a dividend
of FFr14.00 and a tax credit of FFr7.00.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Politics ground Jordanian
airline sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JORDAN'S economy is growing rapidly and the private sector is buoyant. But
plans to privatise Royal Jordanian, the state-owned airline, have made
little headway since the idea was first aired by the government five years
ago.
The sale of the airline remains a difficult political pill for the
government to swallow. The main problem lies with transforming it from an
over-staffed and debt-laden operation into a business with clear investment
appeal.
Royal Jordanian has borrowings estimated at between Dollars 250m and Dollars
300m, and although the airline is making steady profits at the operating
level, they come down with a bump once borrowings costs are taken into
account.
According to preliminary figures, operational profits for 1992 totalled
Dollars 54.3m whereas interest payments were running at around Dollars 40m.
Last year, Mr Mahmoud Balqez, Royal Jordanian's chief executive, told a
conference of regional directors: 'One of the reasons for privatisation is
the generation of enough cash and working capital vis a vis the presently
acute undercapitalisation while we debate how best to meet our past
obligations and re-start with a fairly clean slate.'
Exactly how the slate will be wiped clean is not clear. The ball is very
much in the government's court. Treasury officials say that more than 60 per
cent of the airline's borrowings are included in Jordan's Dollars 6.5bn of
foreign debt which is tightly managed under the watchful eye of the
International Monetary Fund.
Observers blame the airline's stretched balance sheet on over-expansion
during the 1980s and the cost of the Gulf war, notably soaring insurance
premiums and the need to relocate large parts of its fleet to Vienna and
Maastricht.
Another obstacle to be circumnavigated is the political sensitivity aroused
by the prospects of mass redundancies as a result of privatisation. With a
payroll of 4,700, Royal Jordanian is an important employer. Unemployment in
the kingdom is presently running in excess of 20 per cent.
A government privatisation committee is currently working to develop a
preliminary strategy for the flotation. It will shortly pick international
consultancy to oversee the privatisation process. The shortlist includes
Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernest &amp; Young, KPMG, Price Waterhouse
and Deloitte Touche Ross.
According to members of the committee, the sell-off will occur in two
stages. First, the airline will be registered, probably this year, as a
government-owned company rather than a corporation.
Under its new guise, and in collaboration with the appointed consultancy, it
will undergo a major restructuring. This will include increasing capital
(presently Dollars 32m), rescheduling debts, and examining the profitability
of fleet structure and routes.
Government shares will then be sold to private investors that may include
other airlines. 'We will be very responsive to know-how and experience, not
necessarily capital,' says a former minister of transport who has been
closely associated with the privatisation debate.
With the tourist traffic recovering, the number of passengers carried rose
by 40 per cent to 1.1m in 1992. Cargo operations carried 44.5m tonnes of
freight compared with 41.6m tonnes in 1991 but remain well below capacity.

SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday suffered a cut in its credit rating by
Standard &amp; Poor's despite being the only Swedish bank to have weathered the
country's severe banking crisis without so far having to apply for state
support, writes Hugh Carnegy.
S&amp;P said it was downgrading Handelsbanken's Dollars 4bn of long-term debt
from A+ to A and its subordinated debt from A to A- because of 'persistent
recession in Sweden and its impact on the strength of its balance sheet'.
S&amp;P also announced it was taking its ratings on Postipankki, a state-owned
Finnish bank, off its creditwatch list where they were placed in February.
But Postipankki's Dollars 3.6bn of long term debt was nevertheless
downgraded from A to BBB+.

decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the US, has affirmed a
lower court decision which threw out a Dollars 148.8m jury award against
Brown &amp; Williamson, the US-based cigarette manufacturer and a subsidiary of
Britain's BAT Industries.
The decision came after almost a decade of legal wrangling.
The case against B&amp;W was brought by Liggett Group, a rival US tobacco
company and now called Brooke Group, and centred on anti-trust issues.
Brooke claimed that B&amp;W has used 'predatory' pricing to limit Brooke's
ability to compete in the burgeoning market for low-priced 'generic'
cigarettes.
Brooke had introduced some ultra-cheap cigarettes, sold in plain black and
white packaging, and was successfully wooing smokers from other brands.
B&amp;W retaliated with its own generic brand, and offered wholesalers bigger
volume-based rebates than its smaller competitor.
Brooke sued, and in 1990 a jury in North Carolina awarded Brooke just under
Dollars 50m. Damages, in US anti-trust cases, are automatically tripled.
However, a federal appeal court in Richmond, Virginia, sided with B&amp;W, and
the Supreme Court, by a six-to-three vote, has affirmed that ruling.
B&amp;W said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the Supreme Court ruling, and
was 'delighted to finally have this lengthy case concluded'. The suit was
first filed by Liggett/Brooke in 1984.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard reaps the reward
of Risc - The computer company's new chief executive finds no room for
complacency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard, in common with other leading computer companies, is
adjusting to a new chief executive. But, unlike IBM and Digital Equipment,
Mr Lewis Platt, who replaced Mr John Young as head of the California-based
company last July, took over a well-tuned machine in no immediate need of
running repairs.
Revenues, profits and orders at Hewlett-Packard are buoyant, in marked
contrast with many of its competitors who are struggling with weak sales and
heavy overheads.
Mr Platt, aged 51 and with the company for 26 years, sees no cause for
complacency: 'A company has continually to re-invent itself. The difficult
part is making changes while you are doing well. You have got to start
before the downhill trends are obvious.'
When Mr Young was appointed chief executive in 1978, revenues were Dollars
1.3bn, mostly derived from test and measurement equipment and hand-held
calculators.
This year, sales are likely to top Dollars 16bn, placing it among the
world's top three information technology suppliers. Its chief strength is
now in computers and desk-top printers. It benefited greatly from a
relationship with Canon of Japan in laser printers, but exploited its own
technology in taking the lead in ink-jet machines.
The computer sector remains a difficult market, however, and investors are
nervous.
A report of Mr Platt's remarks to analysts in Frankfurt last week caused
havoc when it seemed he was warning of slowing sales and order growth in the
second half of the year. The shares fell Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 79.50, and
160 analysts called HP's headquarters to check the accuracy of the report.
In fact, Mr Platt explained, he had made no prediction of sales growth: he
had simply warned that growth in new orders was unlikely to reach the 26 per
cent seen in the first half. 'I do not want to come in with an 18 or 20 per
cent order growth rate - which I think would be spectacular in this
environment - and have the analysts say: 'Oh God, they're not at 25 any
more'.' Late last week, the shares settled at Dollars 81.
HP's trading performance over the past few years has been impressive at a
time when IBM, Digital Equipment and the leading Japanese computer
manufacturers have been making losses. Last month, the company reported a
net income of Dollars 608m for the first half of the year, compared with
Dollars 293m in the same period the year before.
Mr Platt said order growth had been strong across all product lines and all
geographies: 'Europe was exceptionally strong, the US was good, the Far East
was good and in Japan where we have been struggling, growth was in double
digits.'
His explanation why HP seems to be performing so well while others are in
trouble turns on the company's domination of the desk-top printer business -
not the sexiest of product lines, but a valuable model for the rest of the
company.
'We were lucky to have been successful in laser printers,' he said. 'It is a
business characterised by low margins and needs a radically different cost
structure. So we started to work on our cost structures some years ago.
'It was logical to assume the same low margins would eventually be obtained
in the rest of the business. Now in personal computers gross margins are
probably 20 per cent, compared with the 60 per cent HP had been used to.
'We learned the lesson the whole computer business is going thorough and we
learned it just that little bit ahead of everybody else'.
He also drew attention to HP's product portfolio, ranging from palmtop
personal computers to medical diagnostic equipment: 'We have been good at
hitting the mark with the right products.'
HP, in fact, is harvesting the benefits of a bold decision in the mid-1980s
to revamp its entire computer line to take advantage of a powerful but
unfamiliar technology - reduced instruction set computing (Risc).
Invented by IBM, Risc computers get their speed and power from a combination
of complex software and simple hardware. It was a troubled time for HP: 'We
were not in vogue at all then,' Mr Platt says drily.
Today, all the leading computer manufacturers are turning to Risc and to
open, or industry standard, systems. HP's version of Risc, Precision
Architecture, is well-established and the basis of its healthy computer
business. It is a key to client server computing, a significant trend today.
HP's move to Risc is an example of the way the company reinvents itself.
Another is the rejuvenation of its test and measurement operations.
HP started in test and measurement; the division is 53 years old. Three
years ago, however, profits slipped as spending in aerospace and defence
declined and customers turned to computer workstations rather than dedicated
instruments.
A re-engineering team moved in to spruce up the products and restructure the
division. One decision was to develop equipment for the fast-growing
telecommunications industry: 'We jumped in with both feet,' Mr Platt says.
'That sector of the business grew 30 per cent last year.'
He has three objectives for 1993 and beyond. The first is aggressive
restructuring to improve profitability. The second he describes as 'order
fulfilment' by which he means tackling customer dissatisfaction - the
company has the reputation, for example, of being difficult to deal with.
The third is to reinforce HP's culture with its emphasis on enlightened
management.
When will he initiate HP's next round of re-invention? 'What we are doing
today is going to work for several more years,' he says. 'Open systems, the
Unix operating system, client-server computing - we are in the early days of
these trends.'

to expand into new business segments.
Apple is expected shortly to announce large job cuts following its
announcement this month that second-half earnings would fall below year-ago
levels. Apple officials declined to comment on reports of layoffs.
'We want to make Apple a larger part of the information industry,' Mr
Spindler said. This followed the announcement on Friday that Mr John
Sculley, chairman and chief executive, would relinquish the chief executive
role to Mr Spindler, formerly president and chief operating officer at
Apple. Mr Sculley will remain chairman.
Mr Spindler cautioned, however, that Apple could not afford to ignore
problems in its core PC business. Macintosh PCs would remain Apple's largest
business for some time, he said.
Apple's new business thrusts include 'enterprise computing' and a new range
of pocket computers.
The company is also preparing for the transformation of its core Macintosh
PC products to a new technology platform, based upon the Power PC
microprocessor jointly developed with IBM.
Although Mr Sculley has been the chief strategist behind these plans, it
will fall to Mr Spindler to execute them. 'We have turned raw technologies
into products, now we must turn products into businesses,' Mr Spindler says.
Apple's entry into the 'enterprise computing' field began earlier this year,
with the launch of its first 'servers' - high power computers for use in
corporate networks. Competing in a broad range of manufacturers, Apple has
stressed ease-of-use over performance to define its niche.
It is also about to introduce the long-awaited Newton personal digital
assistant, pocket-sized computers that help individuals to organise daily
activities and send messages. For the past year, Mr Sculley has eagerly
promoted the concept of the new product upon which Apple has placed great
emphasis for its growth.
He has positioned Newton technology as a breakthrough in the convergence of
computer and telecommunications technology with publishing and
entertainment, forecasting a multi-billion dollar market for such products.
Mr Spindler's challenge will be to turn Mr Sculley's visions into business
reality. The situation is reminiscent of the circumstances that faced Mr
Sculley when he joined Apple 10 years ago. Apple was then gearing up for the
launch of Macintosh, a radically new type of PC championed by Mr Steve Jobs,
Apple co-founder.
In his early days at Apple, Mr Sculley, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola,
was seen as the hard-headed businessman who could bring a measure of
discipline to Apple.
Over recent years, however, Mr Sculley has become known as a technology
'visionary' while Mr Spindler has been given increasing responsibility for
the day-to-day running of the company.
As chairman of Apple, Mr Sculley plans to continue looking for new business
opportunities. The company, for example, is exploring the potential of
interactive television.
Apple has been seeking out partnerships, but 'those kind of alliances take
an awful lot of time and they have to be negotiated at a very high level,'
Mr Sculley says. 'It is too much for one person. I'm getting tired of
getting up at three or four in the morning and working seven days a week.
'I proposed to the board that we separate the office of chairman from that
of chief executive. The CEO should be the individual who runs the whole
company,' he said. 'The chairman could be the person who makes the high
level contacts and works on these emerging opportunities.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deal that leaves all sides
satisfied - Paul Abrahams assesses Rhone-Poulenc's sale of its stake in
Roussel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of Rhone-Poulenc's 35 per stake in Roussel Uclaf, the French
bioscience group, appears to make good sense for all the companies concerned
 -Rhone-Poulenc, Hoechst, the German company that owns 54.5 per cent of the
bioscience group, and Roussel itself. Whether the Roussel shares are good
value for investors at their present price is another matter.
For Rhone-Poulenc, the deal is a relief. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, has
never made it a secret that he did not want the minority stake that was
foisted on his company by the French state in July 1990.
Mr Fourtou is selling the stake at the earliest possible moment under the
terms of the protocols agreed between Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst in July
1990. He is also taking advantage of Roussel Uclaf's all-time high share
price, up 30 per cent since the beginning of the year on expectation of high
sales of the group's controversial abortion pill RU-486.
Most importantly, the share sale could, at yesterday's share price of
FFr575, raise FFr4.5bn (Dollars 797m) and help reduce Rhone-Poulenc's debt
mountain.
The group's debt is too high, fluctuating at between FFr33bn and FFr35bn,
admits Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director. He aims to cut debt by up
to FFr7bn by the end of the year through the sale of some prefered stock in
the US, the sale of assets other than Roussel, and through positive
cash-flow.
The deal also allows Rhone-Poulenc to dispose of a minority holding which
offered it little operational control and which generated only limited
synergies.
Hoechst directors could scarcely hide their elation about the deal's
structure, which clears a substantial minority shareholder from Roussel's
board and frees the group from direct political intervention from the French
government.
Although the company holds a majority stake, it felt constrained by
political considerations. Rhone-Poulenc is 43.4 per cent owned by the French
state. Erap, the government holding company, also controls 5.5 per cent.
Alternatives to the sale announced yesterday were considered, said Hoechst.
However, the company said it had not been interested in a proposed deal with
Rhone-Poulenc, swapping some of the German group's chemical interests for
the 35 per cent stake.
An outright purchase would have taken Hoechst's gearing from about 41 per
cent to 52 per cent, unacceptably high given chemical companies' present
poor cash-flow, said analysts.
Hoechst directors said the sale could open the way for Roussel to tap the
international equity markets at a later date.
Members of Hoechst's board stressed the potential synergies. Hoechst is the
sixth-largest drugs group in the world with sales last year of about DM11bn
(Dollars 6.55bn). That compares with Roussel's pharmaceuticals sales of
FFr14.8bn. There is little overlap in the companies' drugs portfolios.
Hoechst estimates it will eventually be able to reduce costs at Roussel by
DM250m a year. There remained considerable opportunity for rationalisation
in both production and administration in the long-term, said the German
company. There would also be some sharing of clinical trials, said Hoechst
directors.
The future of Roussel's agrochemicals business remains in doubt. Hoechst
said the operation, which has a turnover of about FFr3.5bn a year, was too
small to survive on its own. A decision whether to merge the business with
Hoechst's agrochemicals operations had not been made.
Whether the deal is good for prospective investors in Roussel remains
unclear. Hoechst has tried to sweeten the pill by changing Roussel's
structure.
The German company intends to sell Roussel its French business, Laboratoires
Hoechst, which has a turnover of about FFr1.2bn. It is also selling the
French group a 50 per cent stake in Albert Roussel Pharma, a marketing
operation in Germany with a turnover last year of about FFr834m.
The businesses are being sold to Roussel for FFr1.2bn, according to BZW, the
global co-ordinator for the internation private placement. The French
company will issue about 2.2m shares at the same time as the share sale,
taking the number of shares issued up to about 29m.
Mr Tirouflet said the sale of Hoechst's businesses was a guarantee of
Roussel's integrity and autonomy, and made the French government view the
deal as more acceptable.
Sales growth in the first quarter this year was only 4.2 per cent,
uninspired even by recent pharmaceutical industry standards. The company is
promising a 7 per cent increase in sales this year and a 15 per cent rise in
net profits before exceptionals to FFr850m.
Roussel is heavily involved in antibiotics, a therapeutic area hit
particularly heavily by price competition in the US. Admittedly, net profits
last year increased by 72 per cent to FFr1.03bn, after a round of
cost-cutting. But much depends on the future success of the abortion pill
RU-486.
As Roussel's international road-show starts tomorrow, its executives will
have some hard selling to do if they are to counter the market's current
dislike of healthcare stocks.

<TEXT>
REPOLA, Finland's largest industrial group, returned to the black in the
first four months due to a strong result from its forestry operations.
Profit after financial items amounted to FM27m (Dollars 4.8m), compared with
a FM118m loss in the same 1992 period, even though the weaker markka pushed
up financing costs by FM257m to FM853m.
Operating profit climbed to FM880m, or 10.2 per cent of net sales of
FM8.63bn, from FM478m, or 5.6 per cent of FM8.46bn in sales in 1992.
Nearly all the growth came from the company's forestry unit, United Paper
Mills, where operating profit climbed to FM804m from FM421m and sales
increased to FM5.44bn from FM4.56bn.
Sales by the group's engineering business fell 22 per cent to FM2.67bn from
FM3.42bn, although operating profits rose to FM57m from FM48m.
The group's third arm - plastic packagings - saw profits rise to FM6m from
FM4m.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Weak metals market 'may delay
sale of Pechiney'
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group which is
a candidate for privatisation, may have to wait for an improvement in the
metals market before it can be sold, according to its chairman, Mr Jean
Gandois.
Mr Gandois, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of privatisation, warned
that the current state of the aluminium market was not conducive to a sale
to the private sector.
Pechiney has been badly affected by the recent steep increase in imports of
cheap aluminium from eastern Europe.
Mr Gandois, speaking at the annual meeting of Pechiney International, its
67.9 per cent owned packaging subsidiary, said the group's first priority
was to 'reduce its losses and then to be privatised'.
The group's privatisation prospects may also be affected by its plans to
raise capital for Pechiney International. Mr Gandois said the unit was on
course for a slight increase in net profits this year from FFr1.07bn in
1992, but might need new finance to continue its acquisition programme.
Pechiney was to have been sold in the mid-1980s, but the 1987 stock market
crash halted the privatisation programme. It is one of 21 companies
scheduled for sale by the new centre-right administration.
The government hopes to proceed with the first of the proposed
privatisations in September. However, several companies on the list,
including the Bull computer company and Air France, are regarded as
unsellable, at least in the short term, because of financial problems.
Pechiney had been considered one of the stronger candidates for sale, due to
its high profile among international investors. However, Mr Gandois' warning
effectively rules out an early sale, as the government would be unlikely to
press ahead with a sale against the management's wishes.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: TAP chief seeks cash injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAP-AIR PORTUGAL, the state airline, needs a government capital injection of
Es80bn-Es100bn (Dollars 501m-Dollars 626m) by the end of the year if it is
to survive, Mr Fernando Santos Martins, the company's president, said
yesterday.
TAP has an accumulated debt of some Es70bn, with operating losses of
Es27.3bn in 1992 and a similar deficit forecast for 1993.
The state plans to sell off up to 49 per cent of the airline later this
year. A government spokesman said the state was willing to inject Es100bn,
provided that a restructuring plan was implemented before the end of the
year and that a pact was signed between management and unions to ensure
labour peace.
TAP has been disrupted by recent strike action, and the unions yesterday
threatened a series of 24-hour stoppages in July. Workers are fighting for
wage increases and against plans to cut the workforce from 10,500 to 9,000
by the end of 1993.
None of TAP's routes is profitable, and it costs the company more than
Es15bn annually to lease its 38 aircraft.
The company faced angry demonstrations from workers when it was unable to
pay all of April's wages on time and was forced to take out a syndicated
bank loan of Es30bn to pay them. There have also been difficulties in
meeting payments for aircraft leasing, fuel and catering services.
The airline, with annual operating costs of Es150bn, cancelled an order for
four Airbus A340 aircraft as it was unable to meet the indemnity payments
involved.
In April, Air Atlantis, a charter company in which TAP was the main
shareholder, was closed down by TAP because of insupportable losses
amounting to Es2.1bn. Two hundred workers lost their jobs and TAP was left
with a monthly bill of Es300m for leasing the defunct company's four Boeing
737-300s.

PREUSSAG STAHL, the third-largest German steel group, returned a loss of
DM96m for the six months to March 31, compared with a profit of DM30m in the
corresponding period a year before.
Sales for the six months dropped by 26.6 per cent to DM1.1bn, down from
DM1.5bn previously. Preussag Stahl's raw steel production was 1.8m tonnes,
down from 2.1m in 1991-92. The company's annual raw steel production last
year stood at 4.2m tonnes.
Preussag Stahl blamed the downturn in the European steel industry for the
loss. 'We have joined the ranks of the other steelmakers, which are all
posting large losses,' the company said.
Capital investments continued to rise, totalling DM144m for six months. A
second blast furnace will start operating in 1994, with a raw steel capacity
of 2.1m tonnes a year. The new blast furnace will replace four smaller and
older ones, allowing significant savings. The restructuring will cost 1,500
jobs over the next three years.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Magistrates' move on Ferruzzi
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Milan magistrates to open a file on the Ferruzzi debacle
yesterday depressed share prices and provoked a hostile reaction from the
Consob companies and stock market watchdog.
The magistrates' step means that any future action by the committee of five
creditor banks working on a rescue plan for the troubled group will be
monitored by a special section of the Milan tribunal. It will concentrate on
Ferruzzi's books to check for possible irregularities or infringements of
company law.
'The judicial initiatives do not help a solution,' said Mr Enzo Berlanda,
Consob's chairman. He also warned of the potential damage to Ferruzzi's
image abroad.
However, the magistrates' decision was welcomed by Italy's small savers'
association. Its chairman, Mr Adamo Gentile, has written to Milan's chief
public attorney, Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, expressing 'extreme
satisfaction'.
Many Milan dealers appeared to find Mr Borrelli's claim that the initiative
was purely a reaction to recent events barely convincing. 'At the very
least, the magistrates are sending a clear signal to Mediobanca that this
time, things can't be done in the old way,' said one.
However, enthusiasm for the magistrates' action was not universally shared,
with some brokers criticising the move, ostensibly to protect small
shareholders, as unnecessary meddling.
'They've already brought down the politicians, now they're looking
elsewhere,' claimed one critic.
Investors reacted with a new wave of sales of Ferruzzi group shares,
reversing the partial recoveries of the second half of last week.
Shares in the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company dropped 2.65 per
cent to L636.2, while shares in Montedison, the main operating subsidiary,
dropped 4.79 per cent to L894.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Collaborating with the customer to make the
magic circle - Andrew Baxter examines the strategy behind Stadco's success
in winning its first order from a German carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW THINGS cheer hard-pressed manufacturers so much as winning a first-ever
contract in a difficult foreign market against entrenched rivals. When that
market is Germany, UK exporters need all the help they can get.
In March, Shrewsbury-based Stadco, part of publicly-quoted Hall Engineering
(Holdings), announced a Pounds 21m order from Audi, part of the Volkswagen
group, to supply vehicle assembly equipment and related tooling - its first
order from a German-owned car company.
Last September's devaluation of the pound against the D-mark helped, says Mr
Alan Mace, Stadco's managing director.
But the victory was also the result of months of close technical and
commercial collaboration between the two companies in a market where
suppliers increasingly need to get in early if they are to influence
production processes.
Devaluation could not have come at a better time for Stadco. Coupled with
the German motor industry's new found commitment to outsourcing components
and manufacturing equipment beyond its traditional domestic suppliers, the
company has a special opportunity to expand its presence in the European
automotive market.
Mr Mace wants to lift Stadco from the second tier of equipment suppliers up
to, or close to, the hallowed inner circle of three big European suppliers:
Comau of Italy and Kuka and Thyssen of Germany. As the carmakers reduce the
number of suppliers with which they deal, Mr Mace wants Stadco to be on as
many contract short lists as possible.
But he also believes that the devaluation, and the experience gained from
working with the Japanese car producers or the Japanese-influenced motor
industry in the UK - such as Rover - puts Stadco in a good position to
develop its automotive pressings business.
Working with Japanese vehicle manufacturers in the UK has prompted Stadco to
adopt their 'cost-down' approach, eliminating waste, implementing continuous
improvement programmes, and tightening stock control in a way that has yet
to be achieved by continental European pressing companies. German vehicle
manufacturers, too, have been slow to specify Japanese production equipment,
he says, but could buy from Stadco, which has incorporated some elements of
Japanese 'lean' manufacturing techniques into its own equipment.
Stadco is the successor to the old Chatwood Safe Company, which now survives
as Stadco Security, the strong room supplier and builder. Together with
Stadco Cooling, which makes industrial cooling systems, this represents only
about 5 per cent of the business.
The rest is automotive pressings - steel stampings and sub-assemblies - and
automation, specialised equipment for assembling parts of a car body.
And this is where Stadco has been growing. Orders received have jumped from
a total of Pounds 25m in 1983 and 1984 to Pounds 115m in 1991 and 1992.
Sales have risen from Pounds 11m in 1983 to Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m in each of
the past two years. That compares with Hall's total turnover of Pounds
135.7m in 1992.
Stadco's profits hit a peak of Pounds 4.86m in 1991, but slipped back last
year to Pounds 2.94m, a reflection of the difficult conditions in the motor
industry.
In spite of the profits downturn, Mr Mace is confident about Stadco's future
and its financial health. The company has been regularly generating cash
since the mid-1980s, he says, and has sold more abroad than at home in five
of the past 10 years.
And, over the past decade, capital employed has only doubled while sales
have more than quadrupled - due to tighter management controls and better
negotiations on payment terms from customers.
Behind the numbers, however, lies a change in strategy which Mr Mace
believes rescued the pressings division from a 'slow, painful death.' In
1986 and 1987, the division was at the peak of its profitability, making
large pressings for the automotive industry.
But Stadco anticipated that customers would increasingly want to retain
their large pressings in-house - to keep body-skin information private as
long as possible, and to save on damage and transportation costs.
The pressings business needed, therefore, to move into the market for
smaller, higher value-added, sub-assemblies, which vehicle makers
increasingly want to outsource. An example is a centre pillar assembly -
'not exactly a glamour item, but there is quite a lot of assembly involved,'
says Mr Mace.
The change of tack has proved correct, he says. 'Had we not moved out of
simple, large pressings, we would not now be in business'.
The automation division, meanwhile, is responding to the growth in its
business and to the increasing size of individual contracts. The division's
final assembly manufacturing space is being doubled to 40,000 sq ft.
At the same time, the division is trying to encourage vehicle makers to
leave it more of the detail of an assembly line design and take it into
their confidence earlier through a process of simultaneous engineering. The
aim is to reduce costs and cut lead times while minimising the risk of
losing business if a contract is put out to bidding in the traditional way.
Mr Mace has recently been looking at automation and pressings companies in
France and Germany with a view to possible acquisition or joint venture.
Working together could win business that would otherwise not have been
available, he says.
But Stadco remains heavily dependent on the automotive industry. 'We're
exposed both to the production side and to the capital expenditure side,'
says Mr Mace.
Consequently, he is on the look-out for a 'third leg' for Stadco - either in
a different part of the automotive industry or, preferably, a non-automotive
business in a technology that Stadco understands. 'I'd feel more comfortable
then,' he admits.

after a loss of Pounds 679,000 (profit of Pounds 3.57m) on the sale of a
ship, redundancy costs of Pounds 256,000 and exceptional amounts written off
investments of Pounds 517,000 (Pounds 2.11m).
Earnings per share emerged at 6.3p (8.2p). No final dividend is proposed
making 1p (4.5p); however, a special interim distribution of 5p is payable
under the proposed buy-out from Idwal Williams.

AMBERLEY, the USM-traded building preservation business with operations in
France and Belgium, finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 91,000, against a Pounds 73,000 profit.
There was, however, a significant upturn in the second half, said Mr James
Leek, chairman. An operating profit of Pounds 48,000 was recorded prior to
exceptional costs of Pounds 60,000 relating to the resignation of Mr Dennis
Buckley, the former chairman.
In March, Mr Buckley and Mr Mark Pye, then managing director, sold the
majority of their shares to Mr Robert Healy and Mr Brian Meddings, who
became chief executive and finance director respectively.
Mr Pye remains as managing director of the French and Belgian operations. Mr
Leek became chairman in April; the same month Peter Cox placed its holding
of 29.99 per cent of Amberley with institutions and with Mr Leek and his
family.
Turnover was Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.18m). Losses per share were 1.71p
(earnings 0.46p) but the dividend is again 1p.

THE reconstructed B Elliott cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 9.37m to Pounds
3.06m in the year to April 2. It turned round from an operating loss of
Pounds 1.83m to a profit of Pounds 3.14m before financing costs and
exceptional charges.
Restructuring involved the complete withdrawal from the traditional machine
tool merchanting activities and sale of the largest machine tool
manufacturing business.
The proposed sale of Philidas (self locking nuts) to reduce borrowings was
not concluded and, as a consequence of refinancing, this profitable business
was being retained and developed.
The group now concentrates on specialist engineering, electrical engineering
and machinery. In the year these continuing businesses reported an operating
profit of Pounds 3.32m, against Pounds 4.16m, on turnover of Pounds 70.5m.
Conversion into preference and ordinary shares of part of the indebtedness
to banks and the raising of Pounds 12m reduced indebtedness by Pounds 27m.
Borrowings at April 2 stood at Pounds 14m.
Losses per share worked through at 43.84p (457.39p).

THE FINANCIAL &amp; General Print Group is to take over Brown Knight &amp; Truscott,
one of the UK's oldest commercial printers, founded in 1825.
Both companies specialise in corporate and financial publishing with clients
ranging from ICI and Guinness to The Body Shop and the Milk Marketing Board.
FGP, based in Edmonton, London, was founded only eight years ago.
Mr Michael Brown, whose family has been involved with Brown Knight since
1855, will become chairman of the new company trading under the Brown Knight
&amp; Truscott name. The combined turnover of group will be Pounds 10m.
Brown Knight incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 914,000 on sales of Pounds
7.1m in the year to end-March 1992.
The acquisition, believed to be worth about Pounds 1.5m, will create a
company with an estimated 10 per cent share of its specialist market.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting bears fruit as Renold returns
to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CUTTING and productivity gains helped Renold, the chain and gear maker,
return to profit last year, even though trading conditions remained
difficult in its important western European markets.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m in the year to April 3,
compared to a loss of Pounds 3m, on turnover increased by 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 125.1m (Pounds 121.5m).
The Pounds 4.2m turnround reflected gains in efficiency and margins rather
than any overall increase in volume. The results came after charging Pounds
1.4m for redundancy costs, against Pounds 1.6m last year.
Following a lengthy period of reorganisation, the group's chain operations
had settled down and were beginning to deliver 'steadily improving results.'
Productivity at the Bredbury chain factory had increased markedly, the
French business returned to profit, benefiting from growth in automotive
chain volumes and greater manufacturing efficiency and, despite lower
domestic orders, German results also improved.
In the Milnrow gears operation profitability was affected by weak demand and
intense competition for standard gearboxes, while the couplings business at
Cardiff produced 'an excellent performance.'
The US operations, where significant cost reductions were made the previous
year, returned to profit, and by the final quarter the devaluation of
sterling began to benefit profit margins on products exported from the UK.
Mr Peter Frost, chairman, said trading conditions had strengthened in some
of the group's worldwide markets, particularly Australia and New Zealand,
but prospects in western Europe remained uncertain.
He added that the full effect of the devaluation of sterling would benefit
the current year, 'as will actions which have been taken, and continue to be
taken, to strengthen the business.'
Interest charges increased to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.8m) while net borrowings
at the year-end declined slightly to Pounds 12.1 (Pounds 12.8m) and gearing
fell by 2 percentage points to 23 per cent.
Earnings per share were 0.9p (losses 5.6p). The dividend is unchanged at 1p.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help JLI leap 64% - New
businesses contribute Pounds 1.16m to operating profits of Pounds 5.95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE acquisitions helped JLI Group, the dried fruits, nuts and pickle
ingredients processor, lift pre-tax profits by 64 per cent, from Pounds
3.17m to Pounds 5.2m, in the year to March 31.
The group bought food processors TG Smith (Fine Foods) for Pounds 800,000 in
April and Cadec in June for Pounds 500,000, as well as packer and
distributor Brookerpaks for Pounds 2.5m in September.
Two rights issues in as many years, which raised Pounds 20.7m net, funded
the acquisitions. Gearing fell from about 33 per cent to 14 per cent and
interest payments to Pounds 734,000 (Pounds 940,000).
The new businesses contributed Pounds 1.16m to operating profits of Pounds
5.95m (Pounds 4.11m) and Pounds 20.4m to turnover of Pounds 104.7m (Pounds
84.3m). Operating margins climbed for the sixth successive year, reaching
5.7 per cent (4.9 per cent).
Earnings per share rose to 9.3p (8.8p, adjusted for the rights issues). The
final dividend is 3.1p giving a total of 4.65p (4.5p).
Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said: 'Our declared strategy is to
improve the quality of our business and earnings through the development of
higher margin, value added activities in food processing and distribution.'
He said the company was aiming to grow organically and through acquisition.
Devaluation of sterling will have an effect as the increase in relative raw
material prices collided with the competitive squeeze on retail prices.
The group said following the acquisitions its snacks division had 20 per
cent of the UK nut market. The snacks businesses were now integrated under
the renamed Tee Gee Snacks with a newly appointed managing director, Mr
Peter Clee.
In the ingredients division, Jack L Israel (Norfolk) and Langwoods, both
food processors, had a 'disappointing year' with selling prices depressed by
low fresh produce prices.
However, Jack L Israel's distribution business performed well and the
division benefited from acquisition.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Allen hit by construction decline as
profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Allen were halved from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 1.51m in
the year to March 28 as the construction industry continued to decline,
undermined by high interest rates in the first half and 'political and
economic uncertainty' in the second. Turnover fell to Pounds 52.2m, against
Pounds 58.9m.
While announcing the results, Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman and managing
director of the group, which has interests in housebuilding, contracting,
hire services and property development and investment, inveighed against pay
rises for directors even when their companies have fallen into losses, long
service contracts and share options.
This time, Allen's six board directors shared Pounds 417,000 for basic
salaries, benefits in kind, and pension contributions, against Pounds
456,000 previously. Some Pounds 440,000 is expected for this year. Further,
main board directors received no performance-related bonuses (last time
Pounds 135,000 was paid), though Mr Greenhalgh said directors and staff of
particular companies were rewarded for meeting pre-set targets.
Margins in the housebuilding and hire services sides were hit as operating
profits declined 27 per cent to Pounds 1.47m and 45 per cent to Pounds
410,000 respectively. Their turnovers were more or less static at Pounds
15.9m and Pounds 7.8m respectively. Completed houses rose by 9 to 280.
Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director, said that Allen had now left the
speculative development market, but that property investment was 'a steady
earner'.
Divisional profits tumbled to Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 150,000) on turnover of
Pounds 437,000 (Pounds 1.6m). Contracting made Pounds 780,000 (Pounds 1.5m)
on turnover down at Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 32.9m). After a one-off 25.9 per
cent tax charge, earnings per share only declined to 5.05p (9.69p), allowing
the maintained total dividend of 5p to be covered. The final is a proposed
3.35p.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher expands Charlie Browns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the retailing group, is expanding its Charlie Browns motor parts
and fast-fit superstore chain by buying 18 similar outlets from the Unipart
Group. The purchase, for about Pounds 3m, will increase the Charlie Browns
network to 79 outlets.
The Unipart outlets are concentrated in the Midlands and Wales whereas the
existing Charlie Browns network is mainly in the north of England.
Unipart, which defied the recession last year to increase pre-tax profits by
29 per cent to a record Pounds 19.1m, is quitting the aftermarket
superstores sector, partly in order to concentrate on its manufacturing
activities.
It has acquired component supply contracts with Toyota and Honda, as well as
with Rover Group, its former owner. It regards the UK's expanding car
manufacturing industry as more attractive than the fiercely-competitive, and
still heavily depressed, aftermarket sector.
However, both Charlie Browns and the Unipart outlets were said by their
respective owners yesterday to be operating profitably.
Unipart confirmed yesterday that it is continuing to negotiate the possible
purchase of Multipart, the parts distribution operation for Leyland trucks,
based in Chorley, Lancashire. Whereas both the truck and van making arms of
Leyland DAF have been sold by the receivers to management buy-out teams,
Multipart remains in receivership.
Unipart is competing for the profitable Chorley operations against a
management buy-out team, but denies reports that bids of up to Pounds 100m
might be in prospect.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Placing gives Enviromed Pounds 15.8m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIROMED, a biotechnology and healthcare group, is to float later this
month via a placing that will value the company at Pounds 15.8m.
The group designs and develops day care surgeries and makes and installs
hospital operating theatres as well as applying biotechnology to monitor the
environment.
Its environmental sensor products are marketed and distributed through a
subsidiary of Halma, the safety and environmental control group.
Enviromed also tests the interaction between chemical products and the
environment. It expects to make a profit of about Pounds 500,000 on sales of
Pounds 5m in the year to September 30.
Societe Generale is placing 3.73m shares at 110p. About 3.1m, of the 14.4m
shares that will be in issue, are being placed on behalf of the company.
This will raise Pounds 2.96m after expenses which will be used to
consolidate group operations at one site in Milton Keynes and will provide
about Pounds 2m of working capital for growth.
Existing shareholders are raising about Pounds 680,000 which will be used to
repay family and friends who have financed group development to date.
Sir Geoffrey Allen, who was research and engineering director at Unilever
until 1990 and a non-executive director of Courtaulds, will be non-executive
chairman.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Danka takes first step into Europe with
Pounds 9m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANKA Business Systems, the acquisitive US-based office equipment supplier
quoted in London, yesterday announced its first move into Europe with the
Pounds 9m purchase of a private UK copier company.
Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the purchase of Saint Group marked the
beginning of an acquisition campaign in the UK.
'Now is the right time to unfold our strategy of seizing fragmented
markets,' he said. 'I believe the opportunities in the UK are very
exciting.'
Although Mr Doyle said in May that Danka would fund purchases through cash
flow and recently increased banking facilities, the latest acquisition will
be paid for with the issue of 1.1m shares and cash of Pounds 498,000.
The vendors of Saint, who will have some 3 per cent of the enlarged company,
have agreed to retain more than 90 per cent of their shares for an
unspecified time.
Mr Martin St Quinton, Saint's majority owner, has also entered into a
three-year employment contract to run Danka UK, as Saint will now be called.
Saint, which distributes Canon, NEC, Konica, and Risograph equipment,
reported pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 752,000 on sales of Pounds 13m.
The group claims net assets of Pounds 1.3m.
Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, Danka's chairman, said he expected Saint's profits
contribution to be significantly higher in the current year, due to the
disposal of two loss-making businesses before being taken over.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey chief takes 32% pay
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY of Mr David Davies, executive chairman of Johnson Matthey, the
advanced materials technology company, rose 32 per cent last financial year,
from Pounds 184,016 to Pounds 242,980.
This followed a 25.5 per cent pay rise for 1990-91.
According to the annual report, Mr Davies's pay last year included a
performance-related bonus for the first time - of Pounds 42,534.
It said bonuses were determined by the management development and
remuneration committee 'for the achievement of budgeted profit targets and
personal objectives which are set at the beginning of the financial year.'
Bonuses are disclosed in the year in which they are paid rather than the one
in which they are earned.
Mr Davies's basic pay rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 200,446 last year
compared with a 9.8 per cent increase to Pounds 73.8m in the group's pre-tax
revenue. Payments to shareholders were lifted by 6.7 per cent to 10.3p.
Since Mr Davies became chairman in January 1991, JM has virtually completed
a rationalisation programme which, among other things, has seen its
workforce fall from 7,358 to 6,142. This boosted profit per employee from
Pounds 5,800 in 1989-90 to Pounds 11,800.
In his annual statement sent to shareholders yesterday, Mr Davies estimated
that without the rationalisation JM's costs in 1992-93 would have been
higher by Pounds 25m.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca rights likely to be seen as a
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 1.3bn rights issue from Zeneca, which closed at midnight, is
likely to be seen as a success.
With the shares standing at 618p yesterday, down 4p, compared to the 600p
rights price, institutional investors are expected to have taken up their
rights.
The stock market was apparently unworried by the issue, with the FT-SE 100
index rising 24 points to close at 2903.4 yesterday.
However, Zeneca, the bioscience business demerged this month from ICI, has a
larger proportion of private shareholders than many companies, estimated at
near 25 per cent of the capital.
Such investors are usually less likely to exercise their rights than
institutions.
As a result the take up could be less than the 90 per cent plus figure often
regarded as a good result for a rights issue.
However, SG Warburg, the lead underwriter to the issue, would hope to place
any rump in the market rather than make a call on sub-underwriters to fulfil
their obligations.
With such a large issue, even a small percentage left would represent a
sizeable placing in money terms.
Investors may be encouraged to buy extra shares because of the high yield
Zeneca offers, and the feeling that healthcare stocks have been oversold
because of fears regarding the impending healthcare reforms in the US.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carlton plans move into Asian television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the broadcasting and television services group is
planning an expansion into the Asian television market.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, managing director of Carlton Television, the weekday ITV
company for the London region, has recently returned from exploratory talks
with leading broadcasters in the region.
The company, already well known to Asian broadcasters through Quantel, its
broadcasting equipment division, is now keen to explore everything from
equity stakes in Asian broadcasters to joint ventures on new channels.
Mr Walmsley had talks in Hong Kong with Star TV, the Asian satellite venture
which claims more than 45m viewers in 38 countries and with the Hong Kong
domestic broadcasters Television Broadcasts (TVB) and Asia TV.
Earlier this month, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation signalled its
intention to become a significant force in the region with an agreement to
pay HKDollars 1.85bn (Pounds 161m) for a 22 per cent stake in TVB.
Star has been talking to a number of potential investors while making it
clear that it is mainly interested in joint ventures on the programming side
rather than equity investments in the holding company.
Carlton has been looking at the potential of television investments in
Singapore and mainland China.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Falling demand behind British Steel deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL yesterday reported its worst annual figures since
privatisation in 1988 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 149m for the year ended
April 3. The final dividend is cut from 1.5p to 1p.
The loss, in line with market expectations, compared to a deficit of Pounds
55m a year earlier, and reflected continuing difficult trading conditions.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Falling demand both in
the European Community and elsewhere and excess production capacity resulted
in significant price reductions across most product areas.'
Turnover fell from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.3bn, and a trading loss of
Pounds 113m (Pounds 98m) was incurred. The latest pre-tax loss was struck
after the company's share of associates' losses of Pounds 19m against Pounds
6m profits last time - and net interest.
The attributable deficit was Pounds 130m (Pounds 34m) and losses per share
widened from 1.7p to 6.5p.
UK demand for British Steel's main finished products fell 4 per cent to 8.2m
tonnes. Total sales volume slipped from 12.2m tonnes to 11.9m, reflecting an
8 per cent fall in UK deliveries and a 4 per cent rise in export volume.
Explaining the dividend decision, Mr Moffat said the board had decided in
November not to pay an interim dividend, but indicated that in the absence
of unforeseen circumstances a final of 1p would be paid.
Subsequently, said Mr Moffat, steel prices throughout Europe fell even
further, but this had recently started to be reversed. 'Prices for steel
products are beginning to move towards more realistic levels, although they
still remain some 10-25 per cent below mid-1989.'
Mr Moffat said that, overall, short-term prospects had improved but the
situation remained 'fragile.' Sustained recovery was heavily dependent on
the proposed restructuring of the European steel industry, and particularly
on effective controls by the EC on the continued availability of state aid
for some producers.
With these issues still to be resolved, the recommended 1p final compares
with the previous year's total of 4.5p.
However, Mr Moffat warned that the reinstatement of dividend payments to
more normal levels would require 'a sustained recovery in the profitability
of the company as well as the continued maintenance of a sound financial
position.'
Looking ahead, British Steel said economic activity in continental Europe,
particularly Germany, had declined in the past year and many countries were
now in recession. Recovery in the UK appeared to be under way, but was
likely to be slow, and the advantages of devaluation would be restricted by
the weak state of most export markets.
In the UK, steel-using sectors were likely to recover at different rates.
Output in the automotive sector was expected to recover due to a combination
of growing demand and the export potential of new UK producers.
But construction output was expected to decline further this year. Overall
UK steel consumption is expected to lag behind a general recovery in the UK
economy.
British Steel's capital expenditure dropped from Pounds 255m in 1991-92 to
Pounds 197m, and numbers employed at year-end fell from 49,500 to 42,100.
However, some 3,300 of this reduction was accounted for by the creation of
Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer into which
British Steel Stainless was merged last November.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clark chairman quits in aftermath of failed
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WALTER Dickson, chairman of C&amp;J Clark, has announced his resignation from
the family-owned shoe company which recently rejected a controversial bid
from Berisford International after months of boardroom dissention.
Mr Dickson, appointed on a three year contract in 1991, is expected to step
down within the next three months.
The chairman, who backed the Berisford bid, will receive no compensation
payments other than the outstanding balance of his salary which was Pounds
206,000 last year. He will retain options, which must be exercised by 1995,
over 615,000 shares at 130p. Earlier this year, the shares were valued at
100p.
The resignation was widely expected following the extraordinary meeting in
May, where shareholders agreed to implement corporate governance proposals
in a bid to fend off Berisford.
In a letter to shareholders this weekend, Mr Dickson said flotation was
expected to occur within three to four years. He also announced that Mr
Roger Peddar, a director, had been appointed deputy chairman.
Speaking from his home, Mr Dickson said the difficulties of the past year
had 'reflected the deep-seated problems of coming to the conclusions they
(Clark shareholders) had to come to . . . I acted as the agent of change.'
Success would now depend on implementing to the full all the promises made
at the EGM, he said. Flotation must be done on 'a proper basis . . . with no
strange mechanisms'. Clark has in recent years considered flotation through
the issue of preference shares which would leave the controlling family
shareholding intact.
Mr Dickson also said Clark, which saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 20.4m
to Pounds 1.7m last year, had returned encouraging results in recent months
particularly in light of the devaluation of sterling.
It is expected that the company will return profits of more than Pounds 16m
in the current year.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: NIE shares rise 26% amid heavy trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Northern Ireland Electricity rose more than 26 per cent yesterday
amid heavy trading, on their first day on the market following
privatisation.
The price of the partly paid shares touched 130p at one stage, against the
flotation price of 100p, before ending the day at 126 1/2 p.
Analysts said yesterday NIE was likely to stay at about yesterday's closing
level in the next few days.
At yesterday's close, the shares were trading at a yield on 1992-93 earnings
of 5.2 per cent, about the average for regional electricity companies in
England and Wales.
SG Warburg Securities was advising clients to sell when the price rose above
125p.
Mr Nicholas Pink, an analyst, said it was difficult to see how NIE could
outperform the market above that price.
However, some institutions were looking to buy shares in the company because
they had been unable to pick up the weighting they sought during
privatisation. The shares were subscribed 2.7 times.
During the day 51m of the 164.6m shares changed hands, making NIE the
heaviest traded stock on the market for the day.
Interim certificates are due to be despatched on Thursday.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon requests suspension of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer, were suspended at the
company's request yesterday morning following press speculation about its
refinancing plans, first announced last month.
The shares were suspended at 78p, compared to the peak of 444p following the
1991 demerger from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer
supplier.
The group, which has seen bad news mount since the beginning of last year,
said 'negotiations for the raising of new equity capital and for new bank
facilities are nearing completion'.
In April the chairman and two chief operating officers were removed
following pressure from institutions. Alexon's largest institutions are
thought to have refused to back a rights issue, needed to reduce borrowings
of more than Pounds 20m, without the board changes.
Alexon is later this week expected to restate its results for the 53 weeks
to January 30. As previously reported, it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
986,000.
The company sought a suspension because it could be several days before the
audited results and details of the new funding requirements are ready. In
consultation with the Stock Exchange, it was decided a suspension would
reduce uncertainty ahead of the announcement.

FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shield Diagnostics plans flotation later
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIELD Diagnostics, a Dundee-based biotechnology company, is planning a
flotation in September or October.
Until recently it was incurring heavy losses but has achieved success with
selling kits to diagnose a number of common diseases in the UK, continental
Europe and North America.
It made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 445,000 in the year
to March 31 1992. But Mr Hamish Hale, chairman, said that in the last
financial year sales were a multiple of those in 1992. It broke even in the
last quarter, but incurred a loss over the year.
Shield's kits are used to diagnose genito-urinary infections such as
chlamydia, and auto-immune diseases.
The company is also developing a product which tests for incipient heart
attacks in collaboration with Stago Diagnostica of France, using funds from
the EC's Eureka programme for technological innovation.
Apax, formerly Alan Patricoff Associates, the venture capital company, is a
large shareholder. Mr Hale is a director of Apax and also has a personal
equity stake in the company.
Details of the flotation have not been decided. The company's stockbroker is
Allied Provincial.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Bradford &amp; Bingley sets up in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRADFORD &amp; BINGLEY, the seventh largest British building society, is seeking
to become the first non-German institution to establish a German building
society.
The society said yesterday that it planned to set up a Bausparkasse - the
German equivalent - in Hamburg. It would be the first UK society to operate
in Germany, although others have operations in France and Spain.
This is a significant development for the German home loans market which has
hitherto been served almost exclusively by domestic institutions, with the
exception of loans made through the branches of foreign-owned banks.
It is also the latest step towards continental European growth by societies.
Halifax, the largest society, disclosed earlier this year that it had
applied for a licence to take retail deposits for mortgage lending in Spain.
The German housing finance market is seen as attractive as there is an acute
shortage of housing in western and eastern Germany. Home owners are fewer as
a percentage of the population than in other industrialised countries.
Other UK societies are thought to have investigated the possibility of
establishing operations in Germany, but have been put off by the regulatory
requirements.
Mr John Smith, Bradford &amp; Bingley's finance director, said the plan was to
set up a Bausparkasse with capital of DM10m (Pounds 4m), the legal minimum.
The aim was to take deposits as well as to make loans within the German
market.
Marketing for the subsidiary would be handled by a new company to be founded
with German partners. This would sell life insurance policies, as well as
loans to finance house building.
Mr Smith declined to give full details of the plans pending approval for the
venture from the Bundesamt fur das Kreditwesen, Germany's federal banking
authority. He said that an application had been lodged and approval was
likely to be granted within two months.
Mr Smith said it was 'a sensible and modest way' to enter the German market
and would avoid over-dependence on wholesale funds. Abbey National, the
former society, has been hit by bad debts on commercial property loans in
France and Spain.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Investcorp funds Thorn buy-out: Management of lighting
division has options to increase 3% stake in new independent company after
Pounds 162m sale to Bahrain-based investment bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI yesterday confirmed the sale of its Thorn Lighting division for
Pounds 162m to Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international investment bank,
in what is effectively a management buyout.
Investcorp, which owns stakes in Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany in New York,
Gucci of Italy and other European and US businesses, has asked the Thorn
Lighting management to take an initial 3 per cent stake in the business.
Mr Philip Buscombe, of the Investcorp management committee, believed Thorn
Lighting's 'rightful place' was as a quoted company. The investors would be
seeking a flotation in the medium term.
As with its sale of Kenwood Appliances and Thorn EMI Software to their
managements, Thorn EMI will retain a stake in the new Thorn Lighting
company. The parent company will receive Pounds 137m in cash, a 12 per cent
equity stake, worth Pounds 8.7m, and Pounds 16.3m in subordinated loan
notes.
The sale leaves Thorn EMI with a Pounds 43m post-tax exceptional charge. A
Pounds 44m book profit is more than offset by an Pounds 87m goodwill
write-off. The charge on this deal will be counter-balanced by a Pounds 34m
exceptional profit on the sale of its stake in Thames Television to Pearson.
Thorn Lighting's launch as an independent company coincides with a sharp
downturn in the continental European economies, where it makes about half
its sales.
But Mr Hamish Bryce, chief executive, said the company was gaining market
share in Germany and France. It would grow through the introduction of new
products and by cutting costs.
The management team, which is investing Pounds 800,000, will be able to
increase its 3 per cent equity stake. Investcorp has granted options to the
30 managers which could raise their stake to about 13 per cent.
Mr Buscombe said this was a feature of most of the 47 deals the bank had
done in the 10 years since it was founded. Investcorp would be managing the
investment of its Arab backers, rather than managing the business.
'One of the secrets of what we do well is not to get involved with
management,' he said.
Investcorp was established in 1982 by Mr Nemir Kirdar, an Iraqi businessman,
who brought investors together within the six Gulf Co-operation Council
countries.
It has tended to lead buy-outs of companies - the largest of which was the
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) acquisition of Saks Fifth Avenue, the US
department store chain - and then place stakes with Arab investors, managing
the stake on a discretionary basis.
The group is on the point of purchasing Circle K, the bankrupt US
convenience store chain. After that deal and the purchase of Thorn Lighting,
it says it will have been involved in transactions with a total acquisition
value of Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.2bn).
Investcorp's last sizeable deal in the UK was the purchase of the largest
single stake in Computacenter, the UK systems integrator.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Head of German stock exchange issues plea for a takeover
code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROLF BREUER, the director responsible for Deutsche Bank's securities
activities, yesterday called for a law to regulate takeovers and mergers in
Germany.
Mr Breuer, who is also chairman of the German stock exchange, said that it
was no excuse to say there were relatively few takeovers on the German
equity markets.
Although many senior bankers privately condemn the lack of rules governing
takeovers, the financial establishment has tended to keep quiet on the
issue, reflecting fears that codification of takeover rules would encourage
a practice which is considered anti-social in Germany.
Analysts have also suspected that large German financial institutions have
benefited from the absence of rules. They have taken advantage of the fact
that it is possible to acquire control of a company by buying a simple
majority of the shares, without obligation to extend the offer to all
shareholders.
The remarks by a member of the board of Germany's biggest bank, made in the
context of a speech about the future development of 'Finanzplatz
Deutschland' - Germany as a financial centre - reflect the German financial
establishment's concern to bring regulations for the securities industry up
to international standards.
The focus at present is on the passage of legislation designed to make
insider dealing a criminal offence, and to introduce a German equivalent of
the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC).
The absence of such laws was seen as a failing, especially by foreign
investors in the German market. For that reason the proposed laws should be
adopted as soon as possible, Mr Breuer said.
The package of new laws will bring disclosure requirements into line with UK
and US practice. At present companies only have to disclose share stakes
when they reach between 20 and 25 per cent, in contrast to 3 per cent in the
UK. There are no current plans to introduce a takeover code.

FT  22 JUN 93 / A new verse in the ballad of Southgate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, has been singing the same song
for so long that he would probably be as grateful as his audience if he
could move on to the next number.
The song, an interminable ballad, is about how he sold many of the family's
tarnished treasures - the businesses he inherited from the group's founder
Sir Jules Thorn - to devote himself to his real loves: making music and
renting out television sets.
The tune some of his followers long to hear is how he made them richer by
splitting the remaining music and rentals businesses into two companies.
Although the sale of Thorn's light fittings division for Pounds 162m
yesterday could bring that day closer, it is still probably years rather
than months away.
Even then, some think Sir Colin should carry on humming his old tune. The
case for demerger, they argue, is far from overwhelming. Both of Thorn's
principal businesses require further development before they can go their
separate ways. It is also uncertain that they would be awarded higher stock
market ratings separately than together.
Thorn EMI has sold off more than 60 businesses since 1985, including the
television manufacturer Ferguson, the semiconductor producer Inmos, and
Kenwood, the kitchen appliance maker.
The decision to concentrate on music and rentals was made in 1990, when Sir
Colin announced he was selling the lighting division, the group's first
business set up by Sir Jules in 1928. After a proposed sale to GTE fell
through, the light bulbs and tubes business was sold to General Electric of
the US, with Thorn EMI holding on to the light fittings side.
Yesterday's announcement leaves the group with just one division, Thorn
Security &amp; Electronics, still for sale. Disposing of it would leave the
group free to concentrate on the rentals sector, in which it is the world's
leading company, and music, in which it is one of the three biggest. It
could also then decide whether there is any sense in the two businesses
belonging to the same group.
Sir Colin does not deny reports that he is talking to the General Electric
Company of the UK about the sale of Thorn's defence business, but he points
out that this is only one part of the security and electronics division.
There is also an electronic fire detection and security side. Thorn also has
a business which has made automatic fare collection systems for British Rail
and the Seoul Metro and which makes credit cards for US banks.
Sir Colin says that while he would like to sell all three parts of the
security and electronics division, they are unlikely to go to the same
buyer. Until they have all been sold, which could take a few years, demerger
cannot be considered.
Sir Colin wants to see the music division expanding in the US, where it has
a market share of 11-12 per cent, compared with 15 per cent worldwide. In
the rental business Thorn is still attempting to introduce the concept of
rent-to-own in the UK. Unlike hire purchase, this allows renters to change
or return appliances they no longer want, but still holds out the
possibility of ownership after a certain period of rental.
Sir Colin does not pretend that there are any managerial reasons for having
music and rentals in the same group.
Demerger, however, can only be considered when the remaining peripheral
businesses have gone.
He says: 'I don't think it's inevitable. The answer can only come when we
sit down and value the businesses.'
Analysts are divided about the desirability of a demerger. Mr Mark Finnie of
NatWest Securities says: 'As long as EMI Music remains part of Thorn EMI it
remains undervalued. Demerger could quite conceivably happen in the next
couple of years.'
Direct comparison of stock market ratings is difficult. PolyGram, the music
company with which Thorn EMI is most often compared, is not quoted in London
and is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands.
But Mr Bruce Jones, of Smith New Court, argues: 'To justify a split, you'd
have to point to some fancy ratings.' He adds that the music industry is not
the attraction it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Sony of Japan
bought CBS, the US record company, and Matsushita bought MCA.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Embattled and embittered: Lloyd's annual general meeting
today threatens to fuel the anger of hard-hit Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The embattled public relations team at Lloyd's of London jokes that the
insurance market has recently become the City's equivalent of the royal
family, as staff reflect on the almost feverish media interest in the
misfortunes of the Names.
The clamour looks set to intensify over the next few weeks after losses of
up to Pounds 3bn for 1990 are reported today. The third successive year of
record losses, to be announced by Mr David Rowland, the market's chairman,
at today's annual general meeting at London's Royal Festival Hall, will
force many hundreds more Names - the individuals whose personal wealth
supports the market - into financial ruin.
The scale of the latest losses is startling:
The 27,770 Names trading in the 1990 year at Lloyd's face losses of between
Pounds 2.8bn and Pounds 3bn, a record in the market's 300-year history.
Average losses per head will be more than Pounds 100,000. Cumulative losses
at the market between 1988 and 1990 will amount to more than Pounds 5bn.
Under its three-year accounting rules, Lloyd's expects to report a loss of
Pounds 1bn for 1991, next June. Already 2,000 Names - of more than 33,000
trading in 1989 - have applied for help from the Lloyd's 'hardship'
committee, which re-schedules the debts of Names and allows them to live in
what it describes as 'modest' circumstances. Normally, hardship cases can
expect to retain an income of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year
and can live in a house which, in London, would be valued at about Pounds
150,000.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, who chairs the independent Lloyd's Names
Associations Working Party, says between 5,000 and 10,000 Names 'could be
completely ruined'. He claims that 17,000 Names have joined the action
groups which his association represents, and are either considering or
taking legal action to recover their losses. He warns that Names are
determined to continue their campaign for compensation, even at the expense
of the market's future.
'We are not going to lie down and be walked on,' says Mr Stockwell.
The problems and anger of the loss-making Names are the biggest challenge
facing the market, whose fortunes in some other respects are brighter than
for some time.
First, during 1992 and 1993, rates - or prices - for the motor, commercial
insurance and reinsurance policies sold by Lloyd's have risen sharply,
generating huge flows of cash into the so-called 'premium trust funds' held
by the market to meet claims. These so-called 'hard' market conditions mean
that most underwriters now believe they are trading profitably across the
board.
Second, Lloyd's business plan, devised by Mr Rowland and Mr Peter Middleton,
chief executive, and published two months ago, imposes radical reforms on
agency businesses and syndicates trading in the market. These underline the
shift to a more active management style. Mandatory cost-cutting measures
should reduce overall expenses by 20 per cent from Pounds 885m in 1991 to
Pounds 665m in 1995.
Third, moves are advanced to bring corporate investors to the market, whose
commitments should help shore up the recent erosion of the capital base.
Lloyd's expects to publish a rulebook, outlining the detailed terms on which
so-called 'incorporated Names' would be allowed to participate. It is hoped
that as much as Pounds 500m in corporate capital will be raised by next
year.
Fourth, the strong cash flow into the premium funds should allow Lloyd's to
soften the impact on Names of the 1990 losses, and thus allow as many as
possible of the 19,700 Names active this year to continue underwriting next
year. New rules will allow Names to borrow from the premium trust funds -
which contain about Pounds 10bn - to pay part of their 1990 losses. In
addition, many syndicate managers are calling for cash from their Names only
when claims are paid, rather than when provisions against expected future
claims are set.
Finally, Lloyd's emphasises that at least Pounds 600m of the 1990 loss has
effectively been provided for by two different parts of the market, and
therefore 'counted twice'. 'Double' provisioning arises because some Names
contend that the negligence of Lloyd's agents is responsible for their
insurance losses, and that these should be paid for by other Names on rival
syndicates which insure agents against legal liabilities. Until the dispute
is resolved, both sets of Names have to set up provisions against the Pounds
600m portion of the overall loss.
Despite such positive trends, there are signs that the precarious finances
of some loss-making Names, and the publicity which surrounds them, have
undermined the confidence of both policyholders and investors. This is
especially so in the US, which generates up to 40 per cent of Lloyd's
business and from which the market is hoping to attract new corporate
investors. Brokers, who place business in Lloyd's on behalf of commercial
insurance buyers, say some of their American customers are beginning to ask
detailed questions about the underlying security of Lloyd's policies.
'We are spending an awful lot of time getting the facts straight,' says Mr
Andrew Pinsent, chairman of the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee. 'We are
constantly reassuring people that Lloyd's pays valid claims.'
There are also concerns in the US that potential investors might be put off
by the rising controversy surrounding Lloyd's and the actions of some Names.
Earlier this month, Lloyd's moved to tighten its rules for calling
extraordinary general meetings (EGMs), after it emerged that some hard-hit
Names were aiming to organise a series of protests at such gatherings.
After Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer whose family has suffered heavy Lloyd's
losses, announced an initiative to call an EGM to vote on a motion to
liquidate Lloyd's, the market's ruling council moved swiftly to tighten the
rules governing EGMs. Mr Rowland explained that Lloyd's efforts to attract
fresh capital would be adversely affected by reports that Names were
discussing motions to liquidate the society. 'I must do everything I can to
maintain confidence,' he insisted, after increasing the number of Names'
signatures required for EGMs from 100 to 1,500.
However, the rule change came too late to stop another EGM, called by
supporters of another disgruntled Name, Mr Claud Gurney, to be held on July
5. It will consider a motion to charge future investors a premium for their
participation, to help bail out badly hit Names. Nor will the reform deter
Mr Stockwell, who claims that his association could mobilise the 1,500
signatures necessary for an EGM 'overnight'.
'We don't believe Lloyd's can have a profitable future if it decides to
abandon the burnt Names,' says Mr Gurney. 'The goodwill represented by the
Lloyd's brand name should be disposed of for the highest possible price.'
Activists are also threatening to intensify their publicity and legal
campaign against the Lloyd's establishment. There are several possible legal
actions pending against at least two of the market's former chairmen on the
grounds of 'deliberate non-disclosure and misrepresentation at a regulatory
level'.
'They (the chairmen) owed fiduciary duties which they breached,' says Mr
Astor. Mr Philip Dinkel, a supporter of Mr Gurney, says that defeat of the
July 5 EGM motion will lead 'to the next layer of litigation. It is the
inevitable outcome.'
These developments are underscoring the importance of current efforts to
achieve a negotiated settlement to compensate loss-making Names. In the
autumn Lloyd's hopes to make loss-makers an out-of-court offer, financed
mainly from errors and omissions insurance funds (which cover agents against
negligence claims).
The indications are, however, that with limited errors and omissions funds,
the proposed settlement is unlikely to be generous enough to satisfy the
demands of the hardest-hit Names, many of whom could be bankrupted three or
four times over by their losses.
So far Lloyd's has ruled out proposals to supplement these funds by raising
cash externally in the money markets, on the grounds that the cost of such
an exercise would depress profitability and dissuade new corporate investors
from committing fresh capital. Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton would prefer to
defuse the crisis without having to resort to raising debt. But Mr Stockwell
predicts that Lloyd's may be forced to reconsider. He says: 'Lloyd's goes
into the future with a mortgage or it has no future at all.'

This week's London sales of important works by Claude Monet reminds Observer
of a mystery that gave the Impressionist painter's name new meaning to a
young British connoisseur.
His wealthy collector father had given him several canvases, including one
small Monet he thought insignificant until he moved from his Thames-side
home at Henley to a house by the river Tees near Stockton.
There he saw that while the other pictures looked the same in all weathers,
when it was misty the Monet glowed with an incan-
descence it had never had in mists from the Thames. On dry days, however,
the glow vanished. So he telephoned his father, saying Monet must have had a
special way of painting that made his work react to something in the water
of the Tees.
Despite voicing doubts, the father agreed to bring his two other canvases by
the artist for a trial. And although there was no mist and no glow on the
day he came, they decided there'd be enough moisture around at sunrise to
put the theory about the river's glow-triggering effect to the test.
At dawn they took the paintings out in a dinghy, the father holding each of
them over the water then examining it while the son rowed. 'What's the
verdict?', he asked anxiously when the last had been inspected and laid down
with a shake of the head.
'It's as I always told you,' the old man replied. 'Monet doesn't glow on
Tees.'

Liz Forgan, the new managing director of BBC Radio, seems to be finding her
feet at the Beeb. Immediately after announcing she was replacing Radio One's
Johnny Beerling, the BBC's longest-serving programme controller, she shot
off to the Lords Test.
The former Channel 4 programme boss admits not liking cricket but says that
BBC life seems to revolve around the game. And anyway, she'd been offered
'Dukie's box' - normally reserved for chairman Marmaduke Hussey. As for
advertising for Beerling's replacement, she's all for it.
So why wasn't her job advertised? 'Sometimes it's difficult and
inappropriate' - just the sort of stone-walling you'd expect from one of the
Beeb's first eleven.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Searching for business beyond the grave seems a rather desperate measure
even for Britain's job-hungry accountancy firms. But that is the effect of a
dusty clause in the occupational pension schemes (auditors) act which has
just landed on Observer's desk.
Whenever the last remaining or only appointed auditor meets one of three
criteria before completing the annual audit, 'the appointing body shall . .
. reappoint him with his consent . . . as soon as reasonably practicable',
the law reads. Those three criteria are removal, resignation, or death.
Government officials apparently refused to amend the law even when the need
for ouija boards was pointed out. Presumably they do not mind a long wait.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that David Cameron, the last of Norman Lamont's advisers at the
Treasury, is heading off to join Michael Howard at the Home Office, the way
is clear for the new Chancellor of the Exchequer to beef up his team of
outside advisers at Her Majesty's Treasury.
Not that Kenneth Clarke has left himself much room since he has brought
Tessa Keswick and David Ruffley with him from the Home Office. However,
Clarke has said that he wants to be remembered as the chancellor 'who helped
British industry'.
So the search is on for a special adviser who knows the facts of industrial
life.
Given the dearth of takeover activity, there are any number of merchant
bankers who would dearly love to take time off to bend the chancellor's ear
on the subject and build up their contact books at the same time. The job
doesn't pay much but it would look good on the CV.
However, the chancellor would be better advised to cast his net wider and
bring in someone who has real experience of what a rise in interest rates or
sterling means to the bottom line. Hiring a souped-up stockbroker or the
like would send the wrong signal.
If Clarke's quarry is a wise old bird, a couple of still unstuffed owls
would seem perched appropriately. For one, BTR's ex-chairman Sir Owen Green
has plenty of time on his hands these days. As for the other, it would ease
life for the next generation of management at Hanson if the good Lord
himself took on some outside interests that kept him out of the office.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Slow steps to private coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will soon be able to judge how successful its first steps to
privatise the coal industry have been. British Coal has received about 100
expressions of interest from private sector companies considering a use for
four of the 20 mines it no longer wants. Unfortunately, it is likely that
few will make firm proposals to reopen them as mines when the deadline for
detailed entries ends next month.
Since the government published its coal white paper in March, a response to
the outcry which followed an earlier decision to close three-fifths of
British Coal's capacity, market conditions have deteriorated. Tighter
controls on emissions from power stations and an improvement in nuclear
power efficiency have reinforced the electricity generators' determination
to drive a hard bargain on coal purchases.
This has spread economic uncertainty across most of the British coal
industry, while at the same time reducing the attractions to private
operators of discarded British Coal facilities. The four pits which by last
week had attracted 100 expressions of interest were Easington, Cotgrave,
Silverhill and Bolsover. Another 16 are being advertised.
The paucity of ministerial action on coal since March suggests the
government is indifferent as to whether the pits are taken on by the private
sector or not. Ministers may think they cannot lose either way. If some pits
are saved, they can argue that the privatisation process has begun. If no
pits are taken on by private operators, they can say they were right all
along; the market cannot sustain a large coal industry.
Urgent task
This inaction is justified with the explanation that nothing much can be
done until privatisation legislation finds a place in the parliamentary
timetable, probably in the next 12 months. But there are steps the
government could, and should, take now.
The most urgent task is to give clearer signals about the form of the
subsidies which the government has already agreed in principle to pay for
output from British Coal's 12 reprieved mines and from pits taken over from
the corporation by private operators. The private sector cannot be expected
to commit itself to deal in uneconomically priced coal on the basis of a
vaguely worded promise. There is, admittedly, the difficulty that in
defining the subsidy beforehand the government will give too much away,
either to the producers or generators. But compromise will have to be found
if the privatisation process is to begin.
Competitive process
A second point concerns the procedures for licensing out British Coal's
unwanted pits. In its white paper the government promised to set up an
independent coal authority to perform this role, and said the necessary
legislation would be included in the privatisation bill. In the meantime,
however, this task is being carried out by British Coal itself, and
questions are naturally being asked about the corporation's impartiality in
deciding whether pits should be handed over to rivals in a fiercely
competitive market.
So far British Coal has acted reasonably, but the competitive process has
barely begun. The Department of Trade and Industry could instil greater
confidence in the emerging coal market by appointing, on a temporary basis,
an assessor who is not an employee of the corporation. The assessor could
work at British Coal's offices and with its staff, but should be answerable
directly to the DTI rather than to the corporation board.
A third step the government could take would be to push through, before the
full privatisation bill, the small but important changes which are needed in
the law governing coal operations. For example, private operators may at
present have no more than 150 people underground at any one pit. This puts
them at an absurd disadvantage. Also, the government already has
parliament's approval to lift limits on underground working hours which, by
being unduly restrictive, have for years hampered efficiency at British
Coal. For the sake of both the private and public sectors in coal, the
government needs to move swiftly to introduce these reforms.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Personal View: Science policy for the central planner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, UK minister for science, does not seem to understand
why a market economy is efficient. The centrepiece of his white paper on
science, engineering and technology is the adoption of the methods of the
central planner to guide the government's expenditure on research in the
academic world.
Called 'technology foresight', the favoured technique entails setting up
panels of experts for each technology sector in the economy. These panels
will collect opinions on scientific opportunities and potential market
applications from experts in each sector, and then seek to identify the
technologies which will be most important to the economy. The criterion of
importance will be the match between the strength of the research groups and
that of companies able to exploit their research.
The government aims to establish a single consensus view of the academic
research that the government should finance to help industry; it will also
increase the quantity of this commercially relevant research. But a market
economy is more efficient than a centrally planned economy because there are
many sources of decisions, not just one. No fallible human can be right most
of the time about such uncertain issues as research that will produce useful
results. The more people take such decisions independently, the greater
chance there is that someone will be right. If individual companies
undertake 'technology foresight' to guide their research programmes, they
should promote economic growth. But if governments do it, and impose their
views on the economy, they will hinder organic growth.
Prosperity may also be reduced by emphasising commercial relevance when
selecting academic research for support. Such relevance is appropriate to
technology, where academics would naturally have close relations with
industry; but it is less likely to be appropriate in the sciences. If most
academic research is expected to produce applicable results, less
curiosity-orientated research will be done. Curiosity-orientated research -
pure research - has led to important new industries, such as biotechnology,
and often to useful by-products. Emphasising utility in academic research
may reduce the chance of breakthroughs which provide significant industrial
benefits.
Science policy has long been the last refuge of the enthusiastic planner.
The founding father of science policy, J D Bernal, was a Marxist. Many of
the people attracted to the subject do not believe in the market, and
businessmen and scientists often fail to recognise the conceptual difference
between a company and a state.
It is surprising that a government which espouses the advantages of the
market economy should share such conceptual confusions, and that it should
rely on a largely untried technique for planning future expenditure on
science. Although the white paper says that 'technology foresight' has
delivered considerable benefits in other countries, the supporting study
shows that these benefits have been in developing policies and promoting
discussion - not in improving the productivity of research. The technique is
still at an experimental stage, and has been used on a large scale only in
Japan and the Netherlands. The government will therefore be lucky if it gets
results by its target date of the autumn of 1994.
The idea that forecasts of UK economic developments and industrial strengths
can be used in deciding which scientific proposals would be worth developing
displays optimism about the forecasts' value and, implicitly, pessimism
about industry's ability to adjust to new technologies. It also betrays
ignorance of the growing internationalisation of industry, and a simplistic
belief in mercantilism. Prosperity will be enhanced if research and
production are done where they can be done with the most efficiency.
A science policy appropriate to a market economy might encourage
industrialists and academics to consult one another, but would leave them to
decide whether they collaborated and what research they should do.
Industrialists know best what research would be relevant to industry and are
most likely to exploit the results if they have paid for them. The
government would only finance pure research for which no application was
foreseen; and provide financial incentives to encourage industry to give
money to universities to fund such research. Academic research is more
likely to benefit the nation if researchers are free to chose what they do;
so government should promote academic independence.
In determining its policy for science, the government would do well to
follow the advice that the German government recently received. That is, the
main question in choosing the areas of science to support should be: where
are the best scientists working?

FT  22 JUN 93 / Leading Article: EC plan from Mr Delors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY HIS discussion of European Community competitiveness at the Copenhagen
summit yesterday, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
prodded EC leaders to take a few tentative steps on a long journey.
Unfortunately, not all of the steps seem to be in the right direction.
The difficulties start at the beginning, with the excessive emphasis on EC
'competitiveness'. The idea of a life and death economic struggle with
competitors abroad may help politicians overcome entrenched obstacles to
needed reforms. But it is a dangerous misrepresentation of reality, since it
reinforces the notion that EC's relations with its trading partners are a
zero-sum game. The issue is not 'competitiveness', but EC economic
performance. The US did not create 29m jobs between 1970 and 1990, compared
with only 9m in the EC, because it was more competitive than the EC. It did
so because its labour markets worked better.
This is only the preamble. At the heart of Mr Delors' plan are eight points:
movement towards the single EC currency; completion of the Uruguay round,
along with fairness in world trade; investment in research and development;
investment in transport and telecommunications networks; investment in the
technological revolution; reform of education systems; improvements to the
fiscal basis for economic development; and a different focus to labour
market policy.
Some good ideas
The plan is excellent in parts, in its support for vouchers to allow
lifelong training, for example, for active labour market policies and, above
all, for completing the Uruguay round. But it is far from ideal. Mr Delors
argues, for example, that member states must pull their economies back into
line on the road to a single currency. But implementation of the convergence
criteria in the Maastricht treaty will fail to provide immediate help to the
EC economy.
Equally worrying are some proposals for EC involvement in the international
trading system. Mr Delors shows courage in his willingness to confront
France's growing doubts about liberal trade. But he also suggests that a
prospective world trade body should take account of currency movements, of
capital flows, of the need to share the costs of environmental protection
and of support for social progress. Unless carefully handled, such ideas
could become excuses for protectionism.
Also disturbing is the crudely quantitative approach to industrial policy.
Spending on research and development should, says Mr Delors, be increased to
3 per cent of gross national product from the current 2 per cent; EC
transport and telecommunications networks, costing Ecu30bn, must be
established; and the EC should invest in the technological revolution,
including a new and expensive information system. How can Mr Delors, or any
official, know these are either the right plans or the right numbers?
Labour market
There are too many such ideas for wish-driven public spending and too little
reliance on the market. The latter is truest of attitudes towards
employment. There is no mystery why the EC's employment record is so poor.
EC member states have robbed participants of incentives. For far too many
people it makes little sense even to seek employment. Similarly, there is
too little incentive to offer employment. The wedge between what it costs to
employ a worker and what the newly employed worker receives is too great.
Things will not improve if the character of labour market intervention does
not change.
Here Mr Delors puts forward at least one excellent idea, which is to shift
taxation away from labour and towards natural resources. But Mr Delors
rejects substantial changes in labour protection laws and the design of EC
welfare states. He is wrong. Both will have to alter. EC member states must
find ways to support personal incomes that do not push so many people out of
the labour market.
This agenda is, like the curate's egg, good only in parts. It is good to the
extent that the issue of the EC's economic future is being seriously
addressed. It is good too in some of the ideas being advanced. But Mr Delors
has not yet advanced a convincing plan. His task is to do so, ideally by
next December.

She regrets that there are those, mostly in the private sector, who still
hammer formulae into their pupils. In most cases learning by rote or
learning 'tricks' can still produce the results without understanding and
after all, that's the way they were always taught]

<TEXT>
Sir, The implications of the present downturn for Europe's carmakers may be
even more profound than Kevin Done's excellent review ('Carmakers hit the
panic button', June 17) suggests. The reunification boom in Germany masked a
real decline in comparable car sales in Europe from the high in 1989 of
13.5m units. After 1990 Europe switched from a seller's to a buyer's market
for cars - a sea change whose implications Europe's industry has only begun
to address.
In a buyer's market, the customer has all the answers. All too used to
taking the customer for granted, Europe's carmakers must now make the
customer the focus of every operation from research and design through
production to sales and after-sales. Thorough and open-minded appreciation
of the customer's needs (not easy in an autocratic industry) discloses the
right solution for every problem.
Of all the customer-pleasing actions that we have identified in our car
industry research, one stands out: under-promise and over-deliver. Whether
in a sales pitch, a warranty or a repair, giving more than you promise wins
long-term friends. Those who adopt this positive philosophy soonest will
find themselves the least affected by the next 'sickening downward lurch' in
Europe's increasingly cyclical car market.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Quality as key to survival of Europe's car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN CLEZY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Heaven help the European car industry if Carole Tongue (Letter, June
15) holds any sway within it. Has she not understood that the renaissance of
the British motor industry owes everything to the infusion it has received
of Japanese methods and working practices and nothing to do with the
relatively low wages and long working hours in Britain? Is the European
parliament unaware that the survival of the motor industry is precariously
dependent upon arbitrary quotas being agreed with the Japanese to keep their
imports within reasonable bounds?
Long working hours have nothing to do with efficiency and competitiveness in
a world market. It is the quality of work which counts and it is in this
respect that Europeans, especially the British, have still to improve.
A number of high labour content industries in Italy continue to move their
plants to the Ukraine, to Tunisia and even to Albania in order to escape the
consequences of unrealistically high social contributions which Italian
politicians espouse and Italian manufacturers are having increasing
difficulty in living with.
Is it possible that the European parliament has not heard that BMW has been
driven to open a plant in the US?

FT  22 JUN 93 / Herculean tasks for new Tory hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke regards the role of chancellor as above all political. He
is right. Power is generated by skil-ful politicking; without it, the part
played is that of a mere office-holder. We should not, therefore, be
surprised that Britain's new finance minister spent the first three weeks in
his new job setting a tone, establishing a mood, ensuring that the signals
he sends out are correct and in tune with the electorate's aspirations. Only
now, in his fourth week, does he feel that his base is prepared. That
achieved, he is ready for the detailed in-house planning sessions that
occupy a chancellor's diary.
When he arrived at No 11 Downing Street on May 28 he noted with relief that
there was no urgent economic crisis to be faced. His experience on Black
Wednesday, when for a few hours the technicians ran the country and elected
ministers were impotent, was one he regards as the worst of his political
life. On the morning after Mr Norman Lamont's downfall, in contrast, the
foreign exchange and stock markets were calm. The political marketplace was,
however, turbulent. He could not afford to take a month or so off from the
airwaves in order to read himself in, as he had done in several new
ministries before. The equilibrium of the government had to be
re-established.
The new chancellor decided that his first priority was political. He spent
much of his time thinking about three set-piece speeches: one to the
parliamentary press gallery, one to wind up the economic debate in the
Commons and, finally, his Mansion House address. All were well received. He
accepted, and kept, many media engagements. He spread himself, and his
message, as widely as he could. What he put across was that he was a
believer in low inflation but, concurrently, a proponent of growth.
This seems impossible, at least to me. No other chancellor has achieved both
objectives simultaneously. Going for growth and damn the inflation would win
Mr Clarke the Tony Barber award for fiscal irresponsibility. He believes
that he understands this, and can avoid it. He will be put to the test next
spring. It is then, in April 1994, that the changes in value-added and fuel
tax provided for in Mr Norman Lamont's last budget will hit the retail price
index. For a few months it may be impossible to keep inflation below 4 per
cent. What then? To judge by the demeanour he has adopted so far, Mr Clarke
might well ask whether the rise in prices was merely a one-off blip caused
by the government's own taxation policy. If so, he would probably resist an
increase in the rate of interest, however persuasively the new governor of
the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, put his familiar counter-inflationary
arguments.
If, however, more insidious inflationary pressures were identified at the
same time - if, say, sterling was falling sharply - interest rates might
well be increased. Mr Clarke remains, for all his experience of the day
Britain was ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism, a believer in
managed rates. He has said loudly enough that he knows there can be no
rejoining of the ERM in this parliament. He would want a Soros-proof system
in place first, but he has never said never. A steep devaluation would be
inflationary. No one can predict monetary policy. But what I have outlined
is the kind of approach ordinary people expect of a chancellor who has
advertised himself as confident, relaxed, a repository of common sense.
In consequence he has become, perhaps for a fleeting moment, the most
powerful man in Mr John Major's government, the prime minister included. He
is certainly the most self-confident. Where Mr Lamont was subject to the
prime minister's authority, his successor may, without saying so, assume
that he is virtually unsackable: that in any stand-off, it is not
necessarily the first lord of the treasury's view that will prevail. Today,
Mr Clarke has the bulk of the party (its Thatcherite wing excluded), the
media, and presumably much of the country rooting for him. He would take
pains to aver that Mr Major can nevertheless sleep safely in his bed at
night. Let us be charitable. Let us believe this. For the media, and the
public, will turn against him whatever he says. Anyway, in policy terms Mr
Clarke sees himself as a carbon copy of the prime minister, with the latter
only marginally less pro-European than he is. He would argue that if Mr
Major were to go down, his chancellor would perforce go down with him.
The new Tory hero's second immediate task was to steer the public spending
targets announced last Thursday through the cabinet. He regards the
commitment to a real growth in expenditure no larger than the growth in the
economy as the toughest that political realism will allow; anything more
severe might not get through a Commons in which the government's majority is
dwindling and the Conservatives are divided. To those who complain that the
ceilings on the next three years' outgoings are not low enough, he might
reasonably respond that what was agreed last week was one contribution to
reducing the anticipated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. It
is open to him to tighten fiscal policy further in November, when the first
unified budget is presented. No one has been able to pin him down on whether
that means further tax increases or further spending cuts; his instinct is
that if the public finances look as dire then as they do now he may have to
do both. Mr Clarke draws strength from the fact that most people know in
their hearts that this is probable.
Those little matters out of the way, the new chancellor is embarking on a
series of internal meetings on selected topics. This week he will review
options for increasing the flow of private capital into public projects;
next week's subject is small business and what can be done for it. After
that they will debate tax policy. No decisions will necessarily be made at
any of these educative sessions, unless Mr Clarke is suddenly struck by a
blinding truth at any one of them. The chancellor starts with a prejudice in
favour of fewer allowances and low rates; perhaps the lightning will strike
there.
He is not one for economists brought in from outside. His predecessor's
advisers have gone. Mr Lamont's council of wise men was invented to protect
shell-shocked Treasury officials from the full blast of public opprobrium.
It will not be disbanded, but I would not place much money on it exerting a
great deal of influence under the new Treasury regime. Mr Clarke is
proposing to consult a few people he regards as leading industrialists who
understand the economy, Sir Graham Day and Lord (Jeffrey) Sterling among
them, but, in the main, he is heaping praise on his demoralised officials
and listening to what they have to say.
Before we all groan that this means more of the mistakes that have dogged us
for so long, we should clutch at the one straw available. It is that huge
self-confidence, the feeling inside the new chancellor's soul that he has
the ability to pick the best advice, and distinguish the officials who give
it from the ones who do not. He will be doing that, probably working harder
than perhaps ever in his life before, when he returns from the August
holidays to prepare the unified budget.
I recall discussing the use of economists in the Treasury with Mr John Smith
when he was shadow chancellor. Mr Smith, like Mr Clarke a lawyer, intimated
that economists are two a penny, buyable with pre-knowledge of their
opinions. What was needed at the Treasury was political nous, an ability to
pick out what would work from what would not. It is that quality that we
must tell ourselves is now being deployed on our behalf by Mr Clarke. He is
one of the most experienced members of the government, and he is not a fool.
He has made a good start. Only a sour old cynic like myself would cast the
slightest smidgen of doubt on the finish.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Matters of opinion: Christopher Bobinski on poll-taking in
east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Europeans no longer have to fear the early morning knock on the door.
When they hear someone outside these days, it is likely to be an opinion
pollster rather than the secret police.
The calls are becoming frequent as local and western academics, and
financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, send out researchers to check the pulse of societies applying
free-market prescriptions to their formerly state-run economies.
One of the latest polls, carried out by the European Community along with
the Gallup organisation, showed that the Albanians are eastern Europe's most
'optimistic' people, while the Russians are among the least satisfied with
the direction their country is going in.
Demand for such information has spawned a small but growing industry of
private local polling organisations, some operating alone, and others, such
as Emor in Estonia, working alongside groups such as Gallup. Industry
estimates for 1991 suggest that 5 per cent of worldwide polling funds were
spent in the former Soviet bloc countries.
Local academic sociologists and psychologists are pitching in too, eager to
catch up on years when the communist authorities frowned on a pastime which
revealed opinions they preferred not to hear.
There are few government-funded research organisations in eastern Europe,
along the lines of the many national institutes in the west - the former
communist states did not feel the need for such organisations.
Today, the climate has changed. Researchers in eastern Europe say that most
people they poll are eager to express a view. 'They see it as a way of
taking part in politics,' says Ms Cynthia Kaplan, a student from the
University of California, who is studying political participation rates in
Russia and Estonia.
Up to 85 per cent of east Europeans agree to answer questionnaires,
according to the pollsters, in contrast with the UK or the US, where people
with clipboards are lucky to get a response rate of more than 60 per cent.
But in Russia, at least, there is still mistrust. 'There are some problems
with senior military men,' says Ms Elena Bashkirova, head of Romir, a
Moscow-based private polling company. 'Army people in general are wary and
do not like to answer questions.' Ms Elena Koneva of Comcon 2, another
private company, adds that some people 'refuse to talk about the
consumer-durable goods they have at home in case burglars should hear about
it'.
Nevertheless, a post-communist enthusiasm for expressing a view means that
opinion polling in eastern Europe is producing findings that are more
thorough and accurate than most polling in the west, according to Ms Meril
James, Gallup's international co-ordinator.
'The quality of the research is incredibly high, it's still a prestige
business,' says Ms James, who recently addressed a seminar organised by the
World Association for Public Opinion Research, held in Tallin, capital of
Estonia.
Demanding information about the nation's political views was part of the
struggle for his country's independence in the 1980s, says Mr Andrus Saar,
an Estonian who owns Saar Poll, a private company. An opinion poll carried
out in Estonia in 1984 was kept 'under lock and key' for four years, until
the Gorbachev era of reform began to ease the atmosphere in the region.
Other experiences of the communist era have helped to create a particular
abhorrence among many east Europeans for the manipulation of opinion poll
findings by politicians. In Lithuania, for example, Ms Rasa Alisauskiene,
from the Baltic Surveys private polling company, recounts with disdain how
the governing party banned the publication of poll results 30 days before
recent parliamentary elections 'because the figures looked bad for them'.
Such action is increasingly likely to draw a hostile response, since the
opinion polls themselves in several former socialist countries such as
Estonia and Poland reveal a feeling among ordinary people that the
politicians are failing to act in their inter-ests.
This is not to say that there is any more of a guarantee in eastern Europe
than elsewhere that interviewees will always respond truthfully. Just as the
polls inaccurately forecast election results in Britain, local exit polls in
Lithuania underestimated by 12 percentage points support for the country's
former communist leader, who was returned to power as a Democratic Labour
candidate. People were apparently unwilling to admit they were voting for a
former communist.
One great advantage for east European polling companies is that they have
access to vast amounts of data compiled in the communist era. Throughout
eastern Europe, police have detailed residence records. Russia and other
former Soviet republics also have lists, originally compiled for the issuing
of ration cards, as good as any electoral registers in the west.
The data enable east Europeans to get a more accurate cross-section for
polling and to interview named people for their research: this method is
seen in the industry as potentially more accurate because it virtually rules
out falsification of results.
And according to Ms James, the cost of carrying out polling is still
relatively low in eastern Europe mainly because of much lower wages in the
east. Whereas in Britain, estimates suggest it would cost the equivalent of
some Dollars 8,000 to have a sample of 1,000 people asked five questions,
the Moscow-based companies would charge between Dollars 3,000 and Dollars
4,000 for a 1,500-strong sample throughout Russia.
It was against this low-cost background that the EC last autumn carried out
perhaps the most ambitious opinion poll ever undertaken in the region. The
Eurobarometer poll of 18 former communist countries revealed that, while the
Czechs and Slovenes are among the happiest people in eastern Europe,
one-third of the region's total population wants to live and work in the
west.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Thorp - doubts about Japan's needs and the plant's
future (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE BATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paradoxically, a letter from Japanese utilities (June 18) stating their
support for Thorp may be the clearest sign yet that the plant will never
operate. When Bronwen Maddox wrote of Thorp as a 'Whitehall nightmare'
('Nuclear scheme that became a 16-year Whitehall nightmare', May 8) she
noted that 'fear of incurring penalties would make it hard for the
government to raise the wider question of whether abandoning the plant, and
releasing all parties from the contracts, could be in the mutual interest of
the UK and Thorp's foreign customers'. Civil servants had described the
situation as a nuclear 'prisoners' dilemma'.
Foreign utilities and their governments also fear penalties and view the
prisoners' dilemma from an opposite but symmetrical perspective to the UK.
If they wish to find a way out of reprocessing, their most effective tactics
are to force the UK government unilaterally to abandon Thorp, while they
declare their unflinching support for the plant. In that way, they may hope
to avoid liability and the punitive terms of their contracts with BNFL.
In fact, two recent events support this scenario. The first is that European
countries agreed tough new conditions under the Paris Convention for
radioactive discharges from Thorp that BNFL will find difficult to meet.
Support for this was particularly forthcoming from Thorp's major European
customers.
The second is the letter from the Federation of Electric Power Companies of
Japan registering full commitment to Thorp and the plutonium fuel cycle.
Such actions and declared support are consistent with Thorp's foreign
customers seeking advantage in the end-game for the plant. The UK should act
decisively, and devote its efforts to closing the plant on profitable terms
rather than continue the futile struggle to keep it going.

future (1)

   From Dr JINZABURO TAKAGI and Ms AILEEN MIOKO SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We would like to respond to the letter of Mr Kohji Kaneko, general
manager of the nuclear power department of the Federation of Electric Power
Companies of Japan, regarding Thorp (June 18). Actions speak louder than
words. MOX fuel - a combination of plutonium and uranium fuel - would be the
single greatest user in Japan of Thorp plutonium. If Japanese utilities
really support reprocessing, why have they not taken any concrete steps to
fabricate and burn MOX fuel in their commercial reactors? When the utilities
say they support Thorp, what they are wanting is a return on their
investment, not the product to be supplied by Thorp.
It is a travesty to mislead the people of the UK into thinking that Japanese
utilities need more plutonium. The reality is that Japan's plutonium
utilisation programmes are so far behind schedule that they simply cannot
absorb the plutonium Thorp will produce. In contrast with other commodities,
plutonium is a material capable of being made into a weapon and cannot be
stockpiled without risk.
Whether the Japanese desire it or not, they will have to reduce supply in
order to avoid a surplus. If Japanese demand for plutonium is low, Thorp
will be a disastrously uneconomic plant to operate.
What Japan needs to submit, and what the UK Foreign Office and parliament
must obtain, are not merely 'we fully support Thorp' statements from Japan,
but concrete data on the real demand - if any - that Japan will have during
this coming decade for Thorp plutonium. This is also undoubtedly a matter in
which the European Commission is an interested party.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Back to real painting - William Packer admires the
work of Michael Leonard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the fatuities and empty posturings of the larger portion of the Venice
Biennale, it is a relief to return to paint on canvas, properly achieved,
and to work that draws directly upon the real and visible world. The
apparatchiks and fellow-travellers of the academic avant-garde may find it
hard to accept: it may be that never again will anything but the
conceptually kite-marked - fauna in formaldehyde (Damien Hirst) or
pseudo-profound philosophising (Richard Hamilton) - be allowed to represent
us: but true painting goes on, as it always will, honourably, insistently,
privately.
It was put to me in Venice that for an artist thus to consult his own
experience was but self-indulgence. With the world falling apart less than a
hundred miles away, was it not ever more the artist's duty to engage with
the issues of the day - nationalism, capitalism, Aids or whatever. Pity the
poor artist who came in from the incorrect side, but even so the idea was
all, the means incidental, the technical quality of the statement
irrelevant. The essential question was not: what is this work as art? It
was: what is it about?
This is the greatest heresy. We no more require to be hectored in our
politics or social morality by artists than by actors or singers. In Venice
the proof lay all about us, where we could find Tiepolo at his most
magisterial while waiting for the boat, and the greatest of Bellini on
stepping off. And the point of such art was never the message itself, for
the preaching was always to the converted. Rather it lies with what each
artist did, technical mastery and the creative, humane imagination resolved
into an integral whole. The artist's duty is only to get the work right as
he knows it, that we may then test its integrity against our own experience.
There is nothing self-indulgent in that.
Michael Leonard is unlikely ever to be asked to represent us at Venice, but
he is nevertheless one of the most serious and particular painters of the
figure that we have. As such he is a member of a band as tiny as it is
distinguished and as conspicuously neglected - Euan Uglow and Victor Newsome
are others who come to mind, particular differences notwithstanding - whose
work owes nothing to expressionism, nothing to immediacy or overt
spontaneity of gesture, and everything to the long, unremitting study of the
life-figure.
Leonard came to painting in his late thirties - he is now 60 - after an
early career in graphic design. He had command from the start of a
meticulous technique, but at first relied over-much on photographic
reference for his imagery, with all the perceptual limitations that follow -
the camera never lies, and never tells the whole truth. What makes his work
so interesting and convincing now is that he has developed from that
position without ever denying or abandoning it.
For the photograph has its uses, properly interpreted and understood, and
Leonard clearly still makes much use of it. In the organisation of the
composition especially, with the interruption of the figure by the frame,
and in the close fore-shortening of the space, the influence of the camera
is undeniable. In the actual disposition of the figure, too, in poses that
if not actually awkward, are certainly unsustainable over an extended
period, the photograph again is a necessary aid. And yet how much there is
now in evidence that could only have been done before the model. The form is
modelled deep into the shadows where only the eye could follow it, and
through and across the lit form, close to the picture-plane, flesh and bone
are described with a subtlety of surface variation, of tone, colour and
texture, that could only have been picked up directly.
His single nude bathers, male and female, stoop and twist to dry themselves:
the man touches his foot in the classic attitude of the crouching Mercury:
the woman in profile reaches up to tie her headscarf. The echo is of Degas,
but while the images as images recall the older artist, the quality of the
paint itself is that of the young Degas, the surface highly finished,
looking to Ingres and the romantic afterglow of neo-classicism. It is a
potent and particular brew. My only reservation is with the painting of some
of the heads of hair, that would seem to have been painted neither from
model nor reference, but made up afterwards, a surprising inconsistency.
I end with two last-minute recommendations. The new Giorgio Morandi Museum
at Bologna opens in October, which event has been anticipated at the
Accademia Italiana, where five choice works from the collection have been on
show for some time. This is the final week, next Sunday the final day. Two
landscapes, a pot of flowers and two still-lifes cover the career, from the
1930s to the 1950s, of the most refined and exquisite painter of our time,
whose 'self-indulgence' in the thing seen, form in space established with
the utmost simplicity, touches the heart, telling us more of what it is to
believe than any polemic.
And Dennis Creffield has returned to painting after his graphic pilgrimage
around the great churches of England and France. An extended stay at
Petworth saw him installed in the very room and painting from the very
window from which Turner took his own view out across the Park. While paying
due respect to the distinguished ghost, Creffield made his own way and found
his own Petworth, expressionist and idiosyncratic. The paintings of the
South End facade, rising like palazzi on the Grand Canal, are especially
impressive.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: The Magic Flute - Maggio Musicale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final opera presented at the Maggio Musicale in Florence was a new
production of The Magic Flute, an event of great artistic merit, the sort of
evening that, alone, justifies the existence of a festival. In the warm,
intimate Teatro della Pergola, the brilliantly inventive Julie Taymor
designed and prepared a fanciful, but never arbitrary, staging that beguiled
the eye and won the heart and, at the same time, set the spectator's mind to
working.
Two qualities especially distinguished Taymor's achievement: painstaking
care (rehearsals must have been many and rigorous) and intelligent
coherence. While every stage-picture, every movement, was magical, the whole
concept followed a palpable internal logic. The airiness of the monsters -
the long snake with large paper scales, handled by black-garbed assistants;
the billowing kite in the form of a bear - was enchanted, but they also held
a menace that was as real to the audience as it was to Papageno.
There was no sign of the Disneyfication of the story, no cuteness; and the
initiatory trials were genuinely awesome, just as the trial of Tamino and
Pamina by separation and imposed silence was fraught with convincing pain.
The noble sentiments of the libretto were not ignored, but rather underlined
by the visual severity of the rituals.
Julie Taymor's long stay in the Orient has enriched her producer's
vocabulary immensely, and this Flute had not only Javanese and Chinese
ingredients (discreet use of shadow figures), but also elements from Kabuki
(Tamino, identifying himself as a prince, stamped his foot in a typical mie
gesture) and - in the final encounter between Papageno and Papagena on a
raised platform - a reference to Punch and Judy. But all these components
were used naturally, as part of a universal and wondrously rich language of
theatre.
Fortunately, the singers were not only excellent musicians but also pliable
actors, especially Manfred Hemm, a genial Papageno, who won laughter and
applause without any hamming or any sacrifice of his attractive singing.
Deon van der Walt was a sober, impassioned Tamino, and Matthias Hoelle,
though the voice was not entirely even, made a noble Sarastro. Sumi Jo was
an appropriately exotic, icy Queen of the Night, and - chief Italian
representative in the cast - Mariella Devia was a Pamina of distinction,
perhaps somewhat lacking in tenderness, but musically admirable and also
natural in her movements. The three ladies (also Italian), superbly masked
and costumed, performed with wit and style. The three boys (soloists from
the Toelzer Knabenchor), chalk-white and silver-bearded, seemed truly to
arrive from another world. The Monostatos of Sergio Bertocchi, shameless in
his politically incorrect assertions, added a properly grotesque touch.
After his sorely disappointing Carmen earlier in the festival, Zubin Mehta
drew some good playing from the scaled-down Maggio orchestra, though - as in
the Bizet - there was little flair or vitality, and at times, notably in
Pamina's music, the conductor seemed to be dragging his feet. But any
deficiency on the podium was forgotten in an otherwise thrilling, indeed
unforgettable performance of this great, but often elusive, masterpiece.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Backstroke in a Crowded Pool - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens when folk try swimming backstroke in a crowded pool? Lynsey and
Chrissie, two young female lifeguards standing on the brink, know only too
well. They spend their time trying to stop collisions and drownings; and
this play plunges headlong into the hectic comedy of pool life, with the two
girls keeping up School of Joyce Grenfell ('Don't do that, George') lines on
the scores of people in the water. We soon know which lane is for beginners
only, what their colleague Melvin is like, and which chaps these girls find
most gorgeous.
It is part of the skill of Jane Coles's new play that we have been busy
laughing at all this before we realise that the pool is also a metaphor for
our modern society, in which Lynsey and Chrissie have to swim along too.
Lynsey has fallen for Hashim Jalib, a handsome young Moslem. No minor crush
this: she prays to Allah, reads the Koran, plans to become his worthy wife.
And Hashim has eyes only for her. There are advantages to such a liaison;
Moslems don't drink, and my favourite line in the play comes when Chrissie
remarks wistfully 'Imagine being made love to by someone who's sober.'
Coles shows us not only Hashim and Lynsey, but their mothers too, neither of
them racist. Fahmida Jelib, in fact, is the best-realised character in the
play, wise, patient, religious and droll; and her sequiturs are more
disconcertingly funny than most people's non-sequiturs. But Lynsey's mother
Carol is a militant animal-rights campaigner, opposed to the ritual
sacrifices of Islam. When the pool is this crowded with conflicting creeds,
who can swim backstroke? (At the pool, the lifeguards keep remarking 'The
pool's getting too crowded . . . And they're still letting more people in.'
Very Winston Churchill.)
So much about this play is so acute, and its mix of humour and serious
social drama is so deft, that I wish its faults were invisible. Sometimes,
however, it nervously overdoes comic touches (as at the end of Act One); or
overdoes its pool symbolism (in Act Two). The big Islam-vs-animal-rights
dialectic in the Act Two dinner-party comes too pat. And the ending manages
both to be too ambiguous about Lynsey and too ickily optimistic about
Chrissie.
A more obvious problem is that John Dove, directing, has the cast of five
speak Coles's lines all at one speed, with minimal change of tempo or
dynamics. Most of them do nice work in characterising their roles -
especially Leena Dhingra as Mrs Jelib, Sophie Stanton as Chrissie, and Raji
James as Hashim - but with all of them there are creaky patches when we are
reminded that they are reciting lines they have learnt.
But, though these real flaws diminish the play, they by no means wreck it.
Coles not only manages to make the different home-lives of Lynsey and Hashim
equally real, she also brings off excellent scenes between Lynsey and Mrs
Jelib, and between Carol and Chrissie. No one in Britain today could watch
Backstroke without feeling its relevance, or sensing how much it manages to
achieve. It is, by the way, the product of an association between the Royal
National Theatre Studio and the Bush, and one of the several emotions it
prompts is hope.

For decades the received wisdom in Britain has been that American television
is rubbish but that, thanks to the Hollywood film tradition, they have a
flair for action drama series and also manage ensemble sitcoms quite well.
Yet in fact, from the days of 'The Twilight Zone', American television has
always been remarkably good at fantasy and science fiction, and although
British television succeeded with 'The Avengers' and 'Dr Who' in the 1960s,
it has not produced anything memorable in this category recently. The
American series Quantum Leap (9.00 BBC2) about a man who inhabits the bodies
of others, is unfortunately inconsistent. Dream On (11.35 C4) is a modern
American sitcom which does not depend upon ensemble playing but upon the
talents of Brian Benben. He plays a New York publisher with an extensive
fantasy life manifested mainly as memories of 1950s television series. This
programme nails another myth by being far more daring sexually than any
British comedy series. BBC1 goes back to 1975 for a memorable British
comedy: The Good Life (8.00) .

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Groping for Trouts in a Peculiar River - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had forgotten until bombarded by a series of missives from the Sturdy
Beggars Company that 'groping for trouts in a peculiar river' is a line from
Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. It comes just after Mistress Overdone has
lamented: 'Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the
gallows, and what with the poverty, I am custom-shrunk,' the suggestion
being that all is not well in the state of England, as indeed around 1604 it
wasn't. There was a war with Spain, a plague in London, executions at
Winchester, not to speak of a general economic recession.
Measure for Measure has always seemed the most complex of Shakespeare's
plays and quite different from the rest in that it seeks to pose a genuine
moral dilemma. Should Isabella sleep with Angelo in order to gain a pardon
for her brother, Claudio, who is about to executed for adultery? Or should
Claudio understand that such an act would be a sacrifice too far for a woman
who is about to become a nun, and prepare to meet his death?
There is also a strongly political content. The old paternalist Duke has
departed and ceded power to a man who is expected to clean up the liberal
excesses of the ancien regime. It turns out that his appointed deputy, who
in this production looks remarkably like an earnest Tory prime minister out
of his depth, is not nearly as pure as he seems.
So it is not surprising that the Sturdy Beggars, a newish company that
combines a lot of the 1970s/80s British left, should have gone in for an
up-date. Here is a good half of the original Measure for Measure, plus
modern glosses. For example, Marianna, the girl who happily stands in for
Isabella in the dreadful deed, turns out to be the daughter of a press
baron, Robert Melville. She has known Angelo at Cambridge and is more than
willing to return to him. There are many other references spread over
history. You will find Mancini, Sergeant Musgrave and Robert Browning listed
in the programme, and a heavy police presence all round.
Some of it is very well done. I liked the nuns playing scrabble with the
letters in what looks like the silver communion cup and taking delicious
pleasure from triple word scores. All the original Shakespeare lines are
very well-spoken, especially by Richard Attlee as Angelo and Gerard Doyle's
Claudio.
Even for the most politically-minded, however, translating Measure for
Measure into a parable for the British left raises insuperable questions. In
so far as it reaches a conclusion at all, Shakespeare's play seems to say
three cheers for paternalism. It is rather like the Labour Party singing
'Jerusalem', nostalgia for the past rather than belief in the future. Does
the new left really regard benevolent despotism as the last best hope?
There is a more practical reservation. Measure for Measure is a complex
enough play to start with. It is hard to expect to bring in a new audience
by chopping it up. You will have to be quite well read, not only in
Shakespeare, to have much of a chance of following it. The very professional
direction is by Stephen Jameson who is also responsible for the adaptation.
And Groping for Trouts in a Peculiar River is a very good title.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: A Rite to remember - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are conductors - almost a majority, these days - who act out the
music, and others who just conduct it. Pierre Boulez is one of the latter.
With the London Symphony at the Barbican on Sunday, his chosen programme
would have inspired many another maestro to strenuous histrionics:
Schoenberg's expressionist Five Orchestral Pieces, the athletic First Piano
Concerto of Bartok, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Boulez found it sufficient
to give small, precise indications to his superbly rehearsed players;
watching him on a silent film, you could hardly have guessed what kind of
music he was conducting, but the audible results were magnificent.
Schoenberg's 1909 pieces were his first atonal foray with orchestra.
Ingenious conductors can dress them in shot-silk hues, to make them more
audience-friendly, or administer violent shocks to keep everybody on their
toes. Boulez did neither, but kept their own strange colours dry and lucid:
one heard much more of the inner workings than usual, with a great gain in
cogency. The effect was to convey an uncommonly wide range of expression,
not just expressionism. The original force of the music was recaptured with
authority.
With Daniel Barenboim as a powerful soloist, the Bartok concerto began
sternly and roughly. The pianist's motor-driven octaves splashed a bit, and
he allowed himself so much sustaining-pedal as to blot and thicken some
passages in the first Allegro where a tight, unambiguous pulse should guide
the ear. With the slow movement, however, Barenboim collected himself for
his concentrated best (with some beautiful wind-playing, too), and
thereafter the performance was a model of intensity.
As for the Rite, Boulez and the splendid LSO gave it a memorable
re-creation. Any good account of this work should leave a potent impression,
but this conductor's grasp of the score is probably unequalled now. Not only
did it sound fabulous - and authentic, without extra colouristic tricks or
wilful sideslips; it was paced with a sovereign confidence that betokened
long, searching attention to Stravinsky's construction, and carried the
music inexorably forward to the last cataclysm. The audience was wholly
gripped: exciting Rites are not so rare, but only once or twice in a decade
are we made to hear what a towering masterpiece it is.

FT  22 JUN 93 / People: A different type of finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building products and packaging group Norcros has filled the slot of finance
director vacated when Robert Alcock was promoted to group managing director
earlier this year by headhunting Gavin Morris, former chief executive of
United Precision Industries.
'We were looking for a different type of finance director, not one from the
narrow discipline of accountancy,' says chairman Michael Doherty; he and
Alcock are both from the profession 'which is more than enough'.
Morris does indeed have an atypical background for a finance director.
Having gained a first in psychology from Edinburgh, with spells at
universities in the US and Germany during that course, he worked for three
years at Citicorp before taking an MBA at the University of Chicago. He then
went to Bain for five years, before joining United Precision Industries as
commercial director of the management buy-in of RHP Bearings. The company
was restructured and sold to Nippon Seiko in 1990; he took over as chief
executive from Alan Bowkett who went to Berisford. Since then he has been
involved in merging NSK's European businesses - helped by his fluency in
German and Spanish as well as his workable French.
At the same time Norcros, which has been going through a long restructuring
phase, announced that EMAP group managing director David Arculus will join
the board as a non-executive director. 'Coming from the magazine and
newspapers business he has a very different outlook on life,' Doherty
explains. 'Producing a product that is waste paper tomorrow if you fail to
deliver it to your customers gives you a far greater sense of immediacy.'
Arculus meanwhile has hitherto not taken on other non-executive positions;
Norcros will give him his first taste of the world of manufacturing.

FT  22 JUN 93 / French cut interest rates below Bundesbank levels: Move
questions D-Mark's anchor role in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S official short-term interest rates fell below German levels
yesterday for the first time in 26 years, in the strongest indication yet
that European central banks are decoupling their monetary policies from the
Bundesbank's.
The Bank of France cut its intervention rate, which sets the floor for the
country's money market rates, by  1/4 of a percentage point, to 7 per cent.
This pushed it  1/4 of a percentage point below the Bundesbank's discount
rate, which serves a similar function in Germany.
Yesterday's move raises new questions about the D-Mark's anchor role in the
European exchange rate mechanism. The French cut was made possible by the
D-Mark's recent weakness against the franc and other ERM currencies.
Currency investors have become increasingly concerned by the deterioration
in the German economy and the country's growing budget deficit, and have
sold D-Marks for dollars and other European currencies.
Four other central banks also took advantage of the D-Mark's weakness to
trim their key interest rates yesterday. Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Austria all eased monetary policy, in spite of the Bundesbank's
determination to keep German interest rates unchanged over the past six
weeks.
The Bank of France's move pushed its official interest rates below Germany's
for the first time since May 1967, when Germany's discount rate stood at 4.5
per cent and its French equivalent was at 3.5 per cent.
Some dealers in financial markets expect the Bundesbank to cut its official
rates soon, after the latest figure for German M3 money supply growth,
published yesterday, came close to meeting the Bundesbank's targets. The
annualised figure for M3 money supply growth for May was 6.7 per cent,
narrowly outside the central bank's target range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per
cent.
Yesterday's European rate cuts did not help to strengthen the D-Mark on the
currency markets. The dollar consolidated last Friday's rally against the
D-Mark and closed in London at DM1.689, up nearly a pfennig on the day. The
French franc shrugged off the rate cut and appreciated marginally against
the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.36. There was little change in New York.
The differential between 10-year government bond yields in Germany and
France narrowed to 0.1 percentage points as dealers took the view that
inflation prospects in France were rosier than those in Germany.
'That narrowing in yields is the strongest possible statement of the
market's confidence in French fundamentals,' said Mr Brian Hilliard of
French-owned UK securities house Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Japan still the 'most competitive nation' but US closing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN remains the world's most competitive nation but no longer outperforms
its trading partners across the board, according to an international survey
published yesterday.
Japan's dominance among nations in the Organisation for Co-operation and
Development is still unquestioned, but the US is again challenging for top
spot, the survey shows.
Britain, meanwhile, has slipped from 13th to 16th in the annual
competitiveness rankings for 1993 compiled by the International Institute of
Management Development and the World Economic Forum, both Swiss based.
Germany has been pushed down to fifth place from second last year, as it
continues to suffer the political and economic strains of unification. The
US has regained the second spot from fifth, while Denmark and Switzerland
rank third and fourth.
Singapore heads the league table for industrialising economies, followed by
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. Chile enters the rankings for the first time
in fifth place, ahead of South Korea.
The report rates 38 rich and poor countries according to 370 criteria
influencing competitiveness. These cover economic strength, the openness of
the economy, the extent to which government policy creates a supportive
business environment, and the quality of infrastructure, management,
technological and human resources. About a third of the indicators are
derived from a survey of more than 2,000 executives.
The report notes a growing concern among executives that improved
competitiveness may be resulting in less employment as enterprises in
industrialised countries seek to cut costs by job-shedding or relocating
production in low-wage countries. It predicts a wave of white-collar
unemployment in the 1990s.

FT  22 JUN 93 / German money supply growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of growth in German money supply slowed in May, encouraging hopes
that the Bundesbank may shortly resume its cautious programme of interest
rate reductions.
However, expansion in the broad M3 measure, reconfirmed yesterday as the
main factor governing the central bank's monetary policy, still exceeded the
central bank's target range.
Credit growth accelerated again and there was a strong rise in public sector
borrowing from banks. These factors helped drive annualised, seasonally
adjusted M3 expansion to a provisional rate of 6.7 per cent, down from 7 per
cent in April, but above the central bank's target band of 4.5 per cent to
6.5 per cent.
Frankfurt economists expect M3 will soon fall back within the Bundesbank's
parameters, and thus allow continued gentle easing of monetary policy. After
yesterday's news on money supply and further cuts in other European interest
rates, a further quarter-point fall in Germany's 7.25 per cent discount rate
is widely expected at the central bank's next meeting on July 1.
However, the scope for fulfilling international requests for more radical
action remain constrained by Germany's mounting public sector deficits and
the weakness of the D-Mark.
Public borrowing, including loans to the Treuhand privatisation agency and
other state enterprises, is one of the main forces behind recent growth in
M3, and has been heavily criticised by senior Bundesbank officials.
According to new industrial surveys, private sector capital investment is
rapidly drying up as recession takes its toll.
Questioned yesterday on developments affecting the stability of the D-Mark,
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, recently nominated as the next vice-president of
the Bundesbank, insisted that foreign exchange rates did not guide bank
policy. M3 remained the key indicator.
Confidence in the D-Mark, which has lost more than 3 per cent of its
trade-weighted value since February, would not be helped if the bank
departed from its traditional policies, he said.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems unlikely to produce its report
on British Gas until the end of July. That is conveniently after both the
BT3 flotation and the departure of MPs for sunnier climes. By then British
Gas's management will have spent a full year pleading its case, though it
seems unlikely to gain much from the whole exercise.
Of the three principal issues in the inquiry: industry structure, the
domestic monopoly and financial returns for British Gas, the company is at
its weakest in trying to maintain its exclusive grip on the domestic market.
Other utilities like BT have been forced to accept competitors
cherry-picking their more profitable customers, so British Gas may not get
much sympathy. Indeed, the company would have appeared more forward-looking
had it embraced competition. By contrast, Ofgas has not made a convincing
case for British Gas to be split up. However, that will be cold comfort
given that the company had hardly expected to be dismembered.
Yet the make or break issue for British Gas will be the rate of return it is
allowed to earn on its assets. Plenty of academic fur has flown debating the
issue, but figures around 4-5 per cent for existing assets and 7-8 per cent
for new investment look sensible. The RPI-5 cap also seems likely to remain.
That leaves British Gas close to the status quo, though heavy cost
reductions will be needed. After a year failing to get the regulatory monkey
off its back, Gas's management must be wondering if it was all worthwhile.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc's plan to offer its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf to the
market appears to contain something for everyone. The vendor sheds an
unwanted minority inherited from the French government and can use the
proceeds to reduce debt ahead of its own privatisation. Hoechst, which holds
a majority in Roussel, is liberated from the uncomfortable position of
having a fierce competitor as a sleeping partner. If the share sale improves
liquidity by increasing Roussel's free float, investors also stand to gain -
supposing, of course, that shares are offered at an attractive price.
If Rhone-Poulenc hopes to raise FFr4.5bn from the sale, an offer price close
to Roussel's current share price is likely. Since the shares have risen by
30 per cent this year, the timing looks a shade opportunistic. Although
Roussel is not extravagantly valued against the French market, a
price-earnings ratio of 17 times this year's forecast earnings is not cheap
by international standards. Valuation is not made easier by Hoechst's
decision to sell its French drugs business to Roussel in exchange for
shares.
While the French drugs market is growing, this exchange of assets works in
Roussel's favour. The promise of cost savings from closer co-operation with
the German giant is equally tempting.
The arrangement underlines, though, that Hoechst will hold the whip hand
from here on. Without Rhone-Poulenc contributing to a balance of power,
investors will have to take Hoechst on trust. Even allowing that its
intentions are honourable, that fact alone demands something of a discount.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI's lighting business has been on the auction block so long that it
comes as something of a relief that the hammer has finally fallen. Whether
it is worth another 3 per cent on the share price, though, is a moot point.
The Pounds 162m consideration is fair for a capital intensive business with
a big exposure to flickering European markets, but it is nothing to get
excited about. Thorn should receive some additional gain from retaining a 12
per cent stake. Nevertheless, the deal will marginally dilute earnings this
year.
The market, though, prefers to focus on the 'clean' rentals and music
business that is emerging from Thorn's once-sprawling empire. Rental and
music will have increased their share of Thorn's operating profits from some
57 per cent four years ago to perhaps 95 per cent this year. The process
will effectively be complete once the security and electronics businesses
are sold - although this may take some time given their complexity.
Certainly, it is hard to argue there was ever much industrial logic in
bundling together light bulbs, sonar systems and CDs. But applying separate
ratings to Thorn's music and rental arms gives a total market worth little
different from where its stands today. It is not yet clear that Thorn's long
march towards demerger will greatly enhance shareholder value.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Steeled for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market seems determined to bet on recovery at British Steel. While its
losses have virtually tripled over the past year, its share price has risen
by more than 60 per cent. Devaluation has improved the outlook. So have the
price rises in the UK, which are sticking, and those in Europe, which will
only stick if agreement can be reached on cutting capacity. Were that to
happen British Steel could be assured of a striking recovery. Without it the
prospect is for more expensive job losses and fresh disappointment on
earnings.
Even so, British Steel looks strong in comparison to its competitors.
Despite both falling demand and weak prices it managed to contain the
increase in its net debt to Pounds 71m last year. The Pounds 213m reduction
in working capital - which is additional to the effect of de-consolidating
the stainless steel activities - will not be repeated. But, unlike most of
its European competition, British Steel can afford to cut its capital
spending further. Its cash-flow should benefit from higher prices and there
may even be a small boost from the sale of Ravenscraig equipment.
Despite extensive rationalisation, British Steel thus boasts a stronger
balance sheet than many European companies which have yet to begin serious
restructuring. That should help if Europe dawdles over capacity cuts, but
the uncertainty does not leave the shares looking cheap. British Steel would
have to earn nearly 7p this year to put the shares on the market's forward
multiple of 14.5. It will be lucky to earn half that, even with an orderly
resolution of the European problem.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Setback for EC state aid controls -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has overturned the Commission's 1991
communication on the transparency of financial relations between member
states and public companies in the manufacturing sector.
The court gave its decision in judicial review proceedings brought by France
challenging the communication. The challenge concerned the information which
the Commission claimed to be entitled to request from member states by way
of implementation of the 1980 directive on transparency in financial
relations between member countries and the public sector.
The 1991 communication requires EC states to provide the Commission with an
annual report of financial assistance given by public authorities to
public-sector manufacturing industry with more than Ecu250m turnover in the
previous financial year.
Details to be provided range from the annual report and accounts to every
kind of aid including grants, guarantees, interest-free loans, capital
investments and dividend information.
The purpose is to enable the Commission to assess the compatibility of the
aid with the Rome Treaty and in particular whether investments have been
made on a commercial basis.
The two main questions considered by the ECJ were whether the communication
went beyond the scope of the 1980 directive and, if so, whether the
Commission had identified the legal basis which gave it the power to do so.
The Commission claimed that the communication added no new obligation to
those already imposed on member states by the 1980 directive. Accordingly,
the communication could not be considered to have any new legal effects
distinct from the 1980 directive. It was merely a particular measure
applying the general information rules established by the 1980 directive.
The court ruled, first, that the obligation for EC states to communicate on
a general and systematic basis data required by the Commission was not
inherent in the 1980 directive. The latter required only that member states
keep certain information on their financial relations with particular
companies for five years and communicate it to the Commission on request.
Since the communication adds new obligations to those in the 1980
transparency directive, it is an act intended to have its own legal effects.
Second, the ECJ found, therefore, that the Commission had breached the
requirements of legal certainty, a general principle of Community law, in
failing to indicate the legal basis for the communication.
The annulment by the ECJ of the communication is likely to throw into
disarray the Commission's state aid scrutiny policy but will not necessarily
affect the assessment of particular state aids granted by member states.
C-325/91: France v Commission, ECJ FC, 16 June 1993.
Matra loses state aid battle against Ford/VW
As a sequel to the recent Cook case, the ECJ has reconfirmed the principles
relating to judicial review of Commission state aids decisions which it
clarified in that case. The case concerned aid granted by Portuguese public
authorities amounting to Esc97.44m for a Esc454m investment in a car plant
by Ford and VW at Setubal. The majority of the aid was paid under the
Portuguese regional aid policy approved by the Commission in 1988. Matra
challenged Brussels' decision not to open a full investigation.
The court upheld the Commission's decision on the facts of the particular
case. It found no grounds to interfere with the Commission's assessment of
the risk of overcapacity in the industry or of the geographical
disadvantages which Setubal undoubtedly had because of its distance from the
main car markets.
Applying the substantive principles on which the court says it can review
state aid decisions made by the Commission, it considered that the
Commission had not exceeded its powers of assessment.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: The gravy train bumps along - The row
over big pay-offs for UK corporate directors is picking up steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The letter from Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, informing
the chairmen of FTSE-100 companies that in future he is 'minded' to vote
against three-year rolling contracts for directors, has added a touch of
spice to the row over big pay-offs for Britain's business leaders.
As head of the country's largest pension fund, which owns 2 per cent of most
UK-quoted companies, Mr Ross Goobey's thoughts carry some weight in British
boardrooms. His concern is not that executives receive excessive rewards for
doing a good job but that they receive huge pay-offs having failed to come
up to scratch.
These excessive payments are more often than not caused by three or
five-year rolling service contracts, which are, at any time, assumed to have
three or five years to run before expiry.
Certainly there have been a number of well publicised pay-offs for senior
executives in past 18 months. Lasmo, the oil services group, came under fire
from shareholders earlier this year for a Pounds 2.2m pay-off to Mr Chris
Greentree, its former chief executive. It was the result of three-year
rolling contract. Glaxo is said to have paid about Pounds 3m to Mr Ernest
Mario, its former chief executive and deputy chairman, after he resigned
following a disagreement with Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo's chairman. In March,
BP revealed that it had paid Pounds 1.5m to Mr Bob Horton when he was ousted
as chairman last year.
These are just some of the bigger pay-offs in the past 18 months. But is it
as worrisome a problem as Mr Ross Goobey suggests?
According to Pension &amp; Investment Research Consultants, an organisation
which advises shareholders on corporate governance issues, only 20 of the
FTSE-100 companies have directors with rolling service contracts of three
years or more. This may suggest long rolling contracts are less common than
many believe.
Mr Richard Weir, director-general of the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, confirms that a number of institutions has been exerting quiet
pressure on the issue for some time, and the trend is now towards one-year
contracts. Nevertheless, his members remain very concerned that there is
still a sizeable number of companies where three-year rolling contracts for
senior executives are the norm.
Not all fund managers and institutions, however, are in agreement that Mr
Ross Goobey's solution - voting against the creation of three-year rolling
contracts - is the best means for forcing the pace of change. Mr Weir says
many of them feel it is inappropriate for institutional investors to
interfere in what is essentially a management issue.
This has prompted the suggestion in some quarters that the real reason the
institutions are reluctant to do anything about it is because many of their
executives are themselves on three-year rolling contracts. Mr Weir says this
is unfair. Five of the 20 FTSE-100 companies identified by PIRC as having
directors with three-year rolling contracts are themselves institutional
investors: BAT Industries (owners of Eagle Star Insurance), National
Westminster Bank, Prudential Corporation, Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun
Alliance. But on the whole, he says, 'long-term contracts in the City are
the exception rather than the rule.' Two of his larger members, M&amp;G and
Mercury Asset Management, have switched to one-year contracts.
But if most institutional investors are not going to follow Mr Ross Goobey's
suggestion and vote against all new three-year contracts, how will the
executive gravy train be stopped?
Mr David Dalgarno, a company law partner with London solicitors Warner
Cranston, believes large pay-offs are both legally unnecessary and arguably
improper.
They are legally unnecessary because there is a duty on the departing
director to mitigate his financial loss after losing his job. It should be
possible even in the current employment climate for most senior executives
to find another job within a year to 18 months, he says. No company
therefore should agree to pay out much more than one year of a three-year
contract except in exceptional circumstances, he says.
Large pay-offs are arguably improper because section 312 of the Companies
Act 1985 makes it unlawful for a company to make any payment by way of
compensation for loss of office without shareholder approval.
In reality, however, section 312 only applies to payments to directors in
connection with their office as directors. It does not apply to payments in
respect of any post they may have had as employees of the company.
More importantly, it does not apply to any payments which the company is
contractually bound to make, nor to any bona fide payments by way of damages
for breach of contract, or any pension payments in respect of past services.
These exceptions are wide enough to ensure that the company's approval is
rarely needed for golden handshakes.
One solution might be to reduce by law the maximum length of service
contracts which can be agreed by a company's remuneration committee without
shareholder approval. At the moment shareholder approval is needed for
service contracts exceeding five years.
The Cadbury report on corporate governance recommended that, in future,
service contracts should not exceed three years without shareholder
approval. Even so, most companies believe that shareholder approval would
still not be needed for three-year contracts.
Mr Dalgarno believes that the solution lies in changing the corporate
culture towards executives' contracts. Few disagree with that. Mr Weir, for
one, says that legislation would be 'too inflexible and ways can always be
found around it'. The only alternative, he believes, is a market solution.
Shareholders and fund managers must persuade companies to restrict service
contracts.
The question is how to go about changing the culture. Mr Dalgarno says
companies should be encouraged to move towards individual performance
contracts which set out in detail what the director is expected to achieve.
If those expectations are met then the rewards will be substantial. But
there would be no pay-off for failure.
Mr Edward Walker-Arnott, senior partner of City solicitors Herbert Smith,
agrees that a change in the culture is needed. But he would not link
performance bonuses to job security. Unless the non-executive directors are
very vigilant most incentive packages are not very well-policed, he says.
From the legal point of view the problem is caused by a combination of
service contracts of more than a year and the refusal of the courts to make
judgments in areas of incompetence. 'Courts hate areas of business judgment.
They are not going to say that alleged incompetence by a chief executive
amounts to a breach of an employee's legal obligations towards his
employer,' Mr Walker-Arnott says.
The solution, he argues, is to 'play it much tougher on contracts'. There
should be a presumption against service contracts of more than a year.
But companies are becoming increasingly aware of the adverse public impact
of large pay-offs. Lawyers are just as likely these days to be asked about
the perception of a severance deal as they are about the legal parameters of
what is proposed, Mr Walker-Arnott says.
Mr Ross Goobey's solution may not be to everyone's liking but by focusing on
the issue he may yet prove to have provided the brake that finally brings
the executive gravy train to a stop.

Statistics show that applications for leave to challenge decisions of public

But these figures greatly exaggerate the use of the procedure and its
effectiveness, according to a study by the UK's Public Law Project.
Any 'explosion' in the use of judicial review has been limited to
immigration and homelessness, according to the report. In other areas legal
challenges to the decisions of public bodies are still infrequent and often
unsuccessful.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Multinational partnership in London -
Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coudert Brothers, the world's oldest international law firm, will this week
formally celebrate the creation of what is arguably the UK's first fully-
fledged multinational law firm.
Its birth has been a difficult one. Coudert has been operating in London as
a US law firm since 1960 and in March 1990 joined forces with English
solicitors Beharrell Thompson &amp; Co, a firm specially created in anticipation
of a relaxation in the English rules preventing solicitors joining in
multinational partnerships.
The three-year delay in incorporating Beharrell Thompson into the Coudert
fold was caused by initial difficulty posed by Law Society rules requiring
registration of foreign partners, and because of negotiations between the US
Internal Revenue Service and the UK's Inland Revenue on taxation of
partners' earnings.
Coudert's London office has 24 lawyers - 20 solicitors, three US attorneys
and one dual US/English qualified lawyer. The intention is to register 21 or
22 of Coudert's 130 partners as partners of the London office. The London
partnership expects to expand to 40 lawyers by the end of 1994.

John Newman is leaving London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the Swedish-owned property
company where he is director in charge of retail property.
His departure comes at a time when the group is increasing its emphasis on
investment rather than development. Newman, 59, was responsible for some of
LET's largest development projects, including the Bull Ring in Birmingham,
the Peacocks Shopping Centre in Woking and the Queen's Street development in
Cardiff, which is under construction.
When Newman leaves at the end of June, his responsibilities will be taken
over by Nicholas Sheehan, the group's managing director.
Newman joined LET in 1985 from Robert Fleming &amp; Co where he had been
director in charge of their property investment and development portfolio.
SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Scandinavia's largest insurance company, which
bought LET for Pounds 491m in 1990, has been bringing the management of LET
under increasingly direct control. John and Peter Beckwith, the founders of
the company, resigned from the board last September.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (12): Once more to Sizewell - The
UK nuclear sector enters a new phase of uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S nuclear industry experienced an uncomfortable winter awaiting the
results of the UK's coal review. It emerged intact, and arguably fortified.
Now it must go under the microscope, and this time there is much more at
stake.
As part of the coal review the government brought forward by a year the
nuclear review which it promised in 1989 when it decided, or was rather
forced by the City, to keep the industry in the public sector rather than
privatise it along with the rest of the electricity sector.
The government is expected to publish the terms of reference within the next
few months and to launch the review later in the year. Environmentalists
fear that the wide-ranging debate they have long hoped for will not
materialise.
Nonetheless the review will set the framework and could decide whether
Britain should build a Sizewell C nuclear station in succession to the
Sizewell B station, in Suffolk, to be completed next year.
Separately, the nuclear industry is to learn - it hopes before the start of
the nuclear review - whether it can commission the Thorp nuclear processing
plant in Sellafield. A second public inquiry, following the first in the
1970s, is conceivable if unlikely for the Pounds 2.8bn plant which has
orders, many from overseas, worth Pounds 9bn for the first decade.
Nuclear industry executives go into this period of uncertainty armed with
what they feel is ample evidence of the value of nuclear power.
Improved efficiency has helped Scottish Nuclear, one of the two state-owned
nuclear electricity producers in the UK, to increase its output from 12.2
terawatt hours three years ago to 14.3 last year, a 25 per cent increase
achieved from the same plant, and it expects 15.1 twh this year.
Two years ago it cost 3.2p to generate a unit (kilowatt hour) of
electricity, but that is now down to less than 3p and the target for 1994-5
is 2.5p.
Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric, SN's much larger equivalent in England and
Wales, has increased its share of the electricity market there to 23 per
cent, up from 16 per cent in 1989-90. Staffing levels are falling fast, from
14,200 at the start of the decade to about 9,400 by next March.
According to Dr Robin Jeffrey, Scottish Nuclear chief executive, one of the
main tasks he and and his colleagues have to perform in the nuclear review
is to tell the world that output and efficiency are going up and costs down.
'We have a successful story to tell,' he says.
The environment lobby disagrees, and is pressing for the review to be more
wide-ranging than the government has indicated it will be. Dr Patrick Green,
a Friends of the Earth campaigner, believes ministers want to limit the
review to whether the 'market' wishes to build new power stations.
That means, he says, that aspects including waste management,
decommissioning, financial controls and government cover for future
liabilities, will be brushed aside. That is a mistake, he says. 'It is
certain that before the private capital markets even begin to contemplate
seriously the prospects of investment in new nuclear power stations,
potential investors will want to know who will be responsible for covering
risks and liabilites.'
Behind this lies the belief among environmentalists that the UK is already
seriously undercovered for future liabilities. FoE puts financial liability
associated with the UK's existing civil nuclear installations at Pounds
30bn, nearly double industry estimates.
In a recent report, The National Audit Office said taxpayers may have to
pick up some of the bill for decommissioning civil nuclear facilities,
notwithstanding the Pounds 1.2bn a year paid by electricity consumers for
the nuclear levy created to meet decommissioning costs.
One fear of Nuclear Electric is that pressure from large electricity
consumers, backed by Offer, the electricity industry regulator, will lead to
a reduction in the levy.
However, on another issue raised in the coal review, that of whether its
eight Magnox stations should be closed early, the company believes it is
safe. 'Magnoxes have been examined thoroughly and we got a result,' says Mr
Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric chief executive.
'The government says they should keep going for as long as they are economic
and we will be pressing that their lives be extended.'
If it loses the case for extension, Nuclear Electric's share of the England
and Wales market will start to fall in the late 1990s from its likely high
of 25 per cent next year when Sizewell B comes on stream. Scottish Nuclear
will also be pressing for an extension of the life of its Hunterston B
advance gas cooled reactor station. For both companies, however, the crucial
issue is Sizewell C: Nuclear Electric because it will build and own it;
Scottish Nuclear because Sizewell C's go-ahead would increase the chances of
it building a new station, Hunterston C, for commissioning around the middle
of the next decade.
Environmentalists and economists will mount a powerful case against Sizewell
C. Nuclear building moratoriums are in place throughout Europe, often in
countries with far less natural resource alternatives than the UK.
Britain has an energy surfeit for the foreseeable future, and the short term
advantage of gas-fired over nuclear power is overwhelming. The Pounds 3.4bn
cost of building Sizewell C compares with Pounds 290m which PowerGen, a
rival generator, spent on building a station with two fifths of Sizewell C's
projected capacity.
The nuclear industry's response also mixes environmental with economic
considerations. Nuclear power is a necessary ingredient of a balanced energy
policy, it says, because it has no carbon dioxide emissions and can
therefore provide a future for coal, which has. Mr Hawley also argues that
gas prices will rise. 'The nuclear input price is next to nothing,' he says.
'Few people deny that nuclear will be needed two decades from now.'
So why not build the stations then? 'Put Sizewell C off and all project
management skills will go,' says Mr Hawley. Britain would lose countless
opportunities to export its technologies.
In the review the government will need to consider where the money will come
from. With its own resources under pressure from a growing public sector
borrowing requirement, the chances are that it is likely to test the waters
for private funds.
The last time it tried to interest the City in nuclear power it received an
unequivocal negative response, the direct cause of the nuclear review now
being planned. There is little to suggest that financiers have changed their
minds about a nuclear industry in the private sector with what they see as
uncertain liabilities for the past.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (11): Locked out of the new
market - Michael Smith on the imminent collapse of the remnants of Britain's
once great coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCH WAS the public furore over the UK government's pit closures programme
last October that it seemed that only a fundamental change on energy policy
could get ministers off the hook.
Six months later, however, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, won
parliamentary support for a programme which was remarkably similar to that
which led to the original decision to close 31 pits.
Although 12 of the pits were reprieved and another six mothballed, the stay
of execution for some, and probably most, will be short, and British Coal
has already given notice that it wants to close three. The problem is that
the government did little to create the room in the market essential for
their survival.
That means that towards the end of the century, the fuel constituents for
electricity, the main market for coal, will be used in much the same
proportions as were envisaged before last October.
Coal will still be the largest element, with perhaps 40 to 50 per cent of
electricity in England and Wales being made from it. But that compares with
about 70 per cent in 1990. The difference is mainly accounted for by the
growth of gas, which may claim 25 per cent of the market against nothing at
the beginning of the decade. Nuclear power, strengthened by the opening of
the Sizewell B plant and improved efficiency, has the potential to increase
its 23 per cent market share.
Coal has been in constant decline since the second world war but few
production drops have been as steep as that between last year, when 65m
tonnes went to the generators, and next. So far at least British Coal has
the promise of only 30m tonnes in 1994-5. The fate of the 12 reprieved pits
depends largely on how much more the corporation can persuade the generators
to take, but this is unlikely to be more than 8m tonnes, enough to sustain
perhaps half of the dozen pits and none of the further six which have been
mothballed.
The sharp sales drop is down to two main factors. The first is that the
economics of building power stations are such that all new power stations
under construction or being planned will be gas-fired.
The government's coal review sparked vigorous debate about whether
electricity from new gas stations was cheaper than that from existing coal
plants, but the generators have no doubt about which form of electricity is
cheaper if building a plant from scratch.
PowerGen, the generator, says the 900MW station it has opened at
Killingholme, Humberside, this year has taken three years to build, half the
time a coal plant would take. The station will be run by 36 people, less
than a fifth of the staff needed for a conventional coal-fired station.
But if that helps explain why gas is preferred by generators it does not in
itself account for the extraordinary speed of the dash for gas. There is a
surplus of electricity in the UK; so why build more plants so soon? The
answer has its roots three to four years ago when electricity was
privatised. The move to gas would probably have happened anyway. But it has
been speeded by the government's creation of just two generating companies.
Fears of the two companies exercising a duopoly influenced regional
electricity companies in deciding whether to help build gas-fired generating
plants; 11 of the 12 have done so. Their participation was essential because
they can provide guaranteed markets for the output.
Supporters of the coal industry say the competition from gas is unfair
because the recs (regional electricity companies) can pass on the costs of
the electricity they produce to consumers. The recs, after all, have signed
15 year contracts with the gas generation companies they partly owned but
only five year deals with the coal industry.
However, the UK electricity regulator has ruled that the recs made sound
economic decisions in setting up the plants.
In the coal review ministers came under strong pressure from the
parliamentary industry select committee to restrict the access of gas to the
electricity market. As if to emphasise its rejection of this approach, the
government, on the day the white paper was published, gave planning consent
to a large gas-fired generator at Connah's Quay in North Wales.
In doing so it was able to emphasise its free market approach. More
important, a halt on the dash-for-gas could have landed the government with
a myriad of compensation claims. It had, after all, always encouraged the
recs' diversification and the move into gas generation.
Ministers potentially had more leeway with nuclear power, as it owns all the
major nuclear companies, including Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear.
Again it resisted any curbs on future generation.
Failing to bring Sizewell B in Suffolk on stream was never a serious
consideration but at one stage the ageing magnox reactors appeared in
danger.
Again money was a primary consideration. Closing them early would have hit
inflows into the Treasury at a time when public finances are tight.
Perhaps in an attempt to balance this lack of action, the government claimed
some success in cutting back orimulsion, the bitumen based fuel imported
from Venezuela. The coal white paper suggested that Venezuela had
volunteered a cut of 500,000 tonnes of coal equivalent a year. This was at
the margins anyway and would not save even one pit.
Shortly afterwards, however, BP Bitor, sole importer of the fuel, said it
expected existing sale levels to continue.
So what did the white paper change? The major difference between the October
plan and that now in place is that the government has introduced the idea of
subsidies. It says it will foot the bill between imported coal prices and
those produced from the 12 reprieved pits.
The caveat is that British Coal must first find a market for them. Given
that the UK last year imported 20m tonnes of coal, that in theory should not
prove too onerous. However, at least half of the imported product is of a
specialist nature not easily accessible in the UK.
That perhaps means that 10m tonnes can be displaced by UK coal. The hope is
that by the time the subsidy is withdrawn, at the time of the coal
industry's privatisation within two years, some of the reprieved mines will
have got the costs down to a level where they can compete effectively with
imports.
Perhaps some of the mines that British Coal no longer wants will be able to
compete with imports in the private sector. However, few analysts believe
that more than a handful of the reprieved or closing mines will survive in
the long term.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (13): Orimulsion gets a toehold
in Europe - Oil stays on the sidelines but a sticky newcomer is knocking at
the door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE of oil used for electricity generation in Europe has been
increasing recently because of low oil prices, but this follows a wave of
shutdowns across Europe with many oil-fired power stations lying idle for
much of the year.
Orimulsion - the bitumen-based fuel - is trying to make inroads into the
European power market but has yet to make much of an impact outside the UK.
The high oil prices of the early 1980s forced a massive shutdown of
oil-fired power stations across Europe. Governments are wary of becoming too
dependent on oil-fired power because they could be held to ransom by Middle
East producers over oil prices. As a result of these trends, much oil plant
is held in reserve to cope with peaks in demand or to replace nuclear or
hydroelectric power plants when they are not available.
Power generators in western Europe used some 80m tonnes of heavy fuel oil a
year in 1980. By 1991 the use of oil for producing electricity had halved to
44m tonnes a year - with most closures being made by 1985.
Recent falls in oil prices have driven some countries to increase their use
of fuel oil in power stations. According to the International Energy Agency,
the OECD energy monitoring group, a large proportion of the power plants in
Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands can be switched from gas or coal to oil
and vice versa at short notice. Few countries are actually building new oil
plant although some are looking at the use of orimulsion - a
bitumen-in-water emulsion fuel produced in Venezuela.
Italy accounts for almost half of the oil that is burned in power stations
in western Europe. It remained committed to oil-fired electricity long after
many of its European neighbours had closed much of their plant, partly
because oil had been the traditional choice of power station fuel in the
country. It has no indigenous coal and Rome had imposed its own moratorium
on building nuclear plant.
Italian power stations currently burn around 800,000 barrels a day of oil to
produce 28 per cent of overall electricity supply. This compares with 70,000
b/d in the UK, where oil plants make up 19 per cent of electricity capacity,
and Portugal, which gets 25 per cent of its electric power from oil.
Spain and France turn to fuel oil when they cannot obtain enough
hydro-electricity, but have no plans to increase their exposure to oil.
France has capacity to take 6 per cent of its permanent electricity supply
from oil and, in Spain, oil accounts for 15 per cent.
The oil-fired generating capacity that remains in Europe is there more by
chance than planning and few countries are looking to build new oil-fired
stations. However, existing plants are cheap to run as oil prices have
declined - crude oil is currently at its lowest level in real terms for 20
years - and they are less polluting because of a switch to low-sulphur fuel
oil by generators.
About five years ago, Italian oil plants were using 90 per cent high-sulphur
fuel oil, but the increasing cost competitiveness of low-sulphur oil and
tougher environmental restrictions have prompted a move into the low-sulphur
variety. The Italian electricity industry now uses around 80 per cent
low-sulphur fuel oil and only 20 per cent high-sulphur.
The cost advantages of low-sulphur fuel oil means it will compete very
strongly with the advent of orimulsion which is trying to break into the
European market. So far, orimulsion has made an inroad only into the UK
where two orimulsion-burning plants have been opened by PowerGen: Ince on
Merseyside and Richborough in Kent.
The UK currently burns about 1.3m to 1.5m tonnes of orimulsion a year.
However, National Power, the other UK generator, is considering a large
development at Pembroke in Wales which would burn between 3m and 4m tonnes
of orimulsion.
Spain has also signed a contract for the use of 1m tonnes of orimulsion a
year in its Fenosa Sabon station which has a capacity of 440 MW. But
planning permits for the construction of the station have delayed its
go-ahead.
The viscous fuel came under heavy attack as a dirty fuel in the recent
debate about coal in the UK, but BP Bitor, its importer into Europe, argues
that its environmental properties are no worse than those of any other fuel.
The company points out that the fuel emits less dust, nitrous oxides and
carbon dioxide than most British coal, but admits that it emits more sulphur
than coal.
BP Bitor is hoping to import between about 20m into Europe by 2000 using the
UK as a bridgehead. The company is hoping to increase this to 30m tonnes by
2005. and expects to see at least one more power station burning orimulsion
in Europe by the end of next year. Demand is expected primarily from
Portugal, Denmark or Italy.
Mr Simon Jacques, industry analyst at Caminus Energy, the consultancy group,
believes the development of orimulsion will be a political issue: 'It will
depend on whether European governments will allow the utilities to sign
contracts for the fuel.'
Orimulsion is priced to be competitive with international coal prices which
means that companies using the fuel would avoid exposure to highly volatile
oil prices. Coal prices are expected to remain flat in the foreseeable
future, but oil prices are also flat at the moment. If oil prices were to go
through a volatile period of rapid increases, orimulsion could prove an
attractive competitor.
BP Bitor points to the difficulties in getting agreement in Europe for any
kind of power plant and believes it could take a lot longer for orimulsion
to catch on than was originally thought.
'It's frustrating for us, having made the investments, that it takes a
little longer for the market to consume it, but it's not going to kill the
thing,' it said.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (8): Where big is beautiful and
rational - Electricite de France, the world's biggest utility, still rides
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIAMH KENNY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the paradoxes of Europe's electricity market is that it was one of
the world's biggest monopolies, Electricite de France, which has done most
to promote the concept of a competitive electricity market for Europe by
gaining access to customers outside the borders of France.
Indeed, some say its initial (and abortive) attempts to sell power direct to
German industry in the 1980s were the catalyst for the European Community's
present efforts to enforce third party access (TPA) into the Continent's
transmission grids.
EdF's aggressive export policy sprang from expediency rather than ideology.
It needed to raise revenue in order to fund its ambitious of nuclear plant
construction programme in the 1980s, which was France's typically forthright
response to the oil scarcities of the 1970s. The export drive then gained
further impetus from the expectations of continuing economic growth.
When these hopes collapsed, EdF's heavy dependence on base-load nuclear
plant (accounting for 73 per cent of its total output at the end of last
year) left plenty of spare capacity for export.
EdF pitched its prices at levels low enough to deter other European
utilities, notably Italy's Enel, from expanding their own generating
capacity. Exports thus began to rise dramatically from the early 1980s, when
plant completions began to swamp demand growth and again, after 1987, when
the cross-Channel inter-connector with Britain was completed.
At the end of 1992, foreign sales stood at around 12 per cent of EdF's total
output, earning it Ffr12.4bn.
Exports are expected to continue rising, before eventually flattening out at
around 70 TWH by 2000. Contracts have already been signed committing EdF to
much of this additional business.
This sounds like the kind of open market trading the EC is keen to develop.
But other European producers are beginning to complain that it is a one-way
trade and that they have little access to the French market, despite some
recent import deals. Perhaps more seriously, they say they cannot complete
against a company which is buttressed against domestic competition and which
enjoys the economies of scale of large monopoly.
The break-up of EdF and its possible privatisation is something which many,
including the European Commission, would like to see. EdF is expected to
resist this robustly, although some restructuring along EC lines is
underway, including the introduction of greater price transparency between
its constituent parts.
EdF's view of privatisation was reflected earlier this year in a series of
highly critical reviews of the UK experience. The reports, which EdF
commissioned from outside consultants, concluded that privatisation in
Britain was characterised by price increases, economic disruption,
short-termism and, ultimately, the replacement of a state monopoly with a
monopolistic private one.
Nor is EdF enthusiastic about another Euro-hobby horse - the 'unbundling' of
its various interests to prevent cross-subsidisation. The benefits of an
integrated business, it believes, include better prices and standards of
service. It has the support of politicians, who believe that the French
system works well.
EdF has a point when it comes to the domestic market. Its reliance on
nuclear power, with all the back-end costs that will ultimately entail, must
surely rule out full privatisation. The inability to privatised the UK's
nuclear stock has already proved the extreme reluctance of the private
sector to accept nuclear risk. Privatising EdF's thermal and hydro stock
would also, it claims, increase prices.
Yet there is pressure for change which is likely to become more insistent in
the next few years.
Firstly, EdF is facing increasing generation challenges inside France which
could hinder its export ability. Its stock of 900MW and 1,300MW pressurised
water reactors (PWRs) have suffered a number of generic problems since the
late 1980s, including faults in the steam generators and cracking of vessel
heads. Repairing them is costly in money and time: replacing a steam
generator, for example, closes a power station for three months.
Capacity is also reduced during the company's regular and five and 10-year
safety reviews, which currently last four months and cover about a fifth of
EdF's reactor every year.
In spite of its surplus of baseload capacity, EdF has also found itself
short of peak-load capacity, as seen in the drought of 1989 which sapped its
hydro-electric output and led to the import of some 6 TWH of power.
A push into the space heating market has also increased EdF's sensitivity to
temperature changes. It estimates that by the end of the decade each one
degree C drop in temperature will raise national demand on its system by
2,000MW.
Therefore, while export contracts are unlikely to be terminated, EdF is
looking closely at two-way deals, such as the contract signed recently with
Britain's PowerGen, allowing it to import up to 850MW at peak demand times.
A second export-limiting factor is the weakness of the transmission system.
Spending on grid reinforcement has taken second place to investment in new
nuclear generation over the past two decades and domestic as well as
international lines are said to be near maximum loading.
Finally, new entrants could come on the scene as the nuclear reactors near
the end of their lives. Originally this was to have started to occur in the
next 10 years, though EdF now intends to extend their operational life from
30 to 40 years.
Whether this can be achieved remains to be seen. But either timescale would
entail a largescale replacement programme, nuclear or other, which EdF can
ill afford at a time when it is committed to reducing the foreign debt built
up dring its last big construction phase.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (9): Demand rises for new
products - Equipment makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE the control room of PowerGen's Ferrybridge C power station in West
Yorkshire is a television screen which alternates between giving information
on the day's forecast power demand and the privatised electricity supplier's
share price.
The stockmarket display is not the only evidence at the 2,000MW coal-fired
station of the changes sweeping the electricity supply industry.
Earlier this year, Dunn International, a subsidiary of Hull-based Prospect
Industries, became the first company to be appointed as lead contractor with
responsibility for virtually all the overhaul and maintenance work at a UK
power station.
The long-term deal, won against tough competition, reflects the customer's
wish to contract out of such work, reducing its workforce and saving money
in the process. If it goes well, similar deals could follow. 'Our
competitors are hoping we'll fall flat on our faces, but we won't,' says Mr
Philip Wilbraham, Prospect's chairman and chief executive.
Recent events at Prospect mirror the changing face of the power supply
industry, which is creating new opportunities to suppliers of equipment and
services but also forces them to be more responsive.
Apart from the Ferrybridge C contract, Prospect last year paid Pounds 10.1m
for Davenport Holdings, which builds and refurbishes water cooling towers.
The aim is to add an important international dimension to the company in the
US and, increasingly, in continental Europe.
This is the kind of deal characterising a period that, on the face of it,
might seem relatively quiet following the heavy recent restructuring of the
European power equipment industry.
The two major companies formed from the mergers of the late 1980s, the
Anglo-French GEC Alsthom and the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, have now
been in business for five years.
Along with Siemens of Germany, these three companies turn up regularly on
the short lists for virtually all the European contracts for gas and steam
turbines and - depending on the country - there are a handful of other names
that can be guaranteed to be bidding.
However, while there have been no takeovers or mergers of such a scale since
the late 1980s, there is plenty of activity, which can be categorised in a
number of ways:
Deals reflecting the changing shape of Europe: the collapse of the eastern
bloc communist regimes has fuelled intense interest in their power equipment
suppliers, which is making the concept of two separate western and eastern
industries less valid. ABB in particular has led the way into eastern Europe
with power-related takeovers and joint ventures in Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.
Siemens, too, has been in on-off negotiations with Skoda Plsen of
Czechoslovakia on a joint venture involving conventional thermal power
plant, and both it and GEC Alsthom have negotiated gas turbine joint
ventures with companies in St Petersburg.
In the short term at least, the value of the eastern companies to their
western owners or joint venture partners is more as a manufacturing source
than as an entree to eastern markets, whose equipment needs have yet to be
matched by finance. In contrast, the acquisitions and joint ventures
undertaken by the big equipment suppliers in eastern Germany have borne much
greater fruit in terms of business won, because of the restructuring and
modernisation of the ageing power industry in the new German states.
Deals involving non-European companies: the big US equipment suppliers have
strengthened their networks of licensees and associates in Europe. General
Electric signed a series of agreements in 1991 with Elin of Austria, and a
year later with Germany's Blohm + Voss, adding to the presence it has
achieved in Europe in its own right and via agreements such as its 10 per
cent stake in GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines unit. Westinghouse earlier
this year signed a two-year co-operation agreement with Finland's Haka Stroi
to develop opportunities in the Baltic states, and last year announced a
far-reaching partnership with Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, which
should strengthen both companies' position in the European market and
elsewhere.
Sectoral activity: restructuring and reorganisation has continued in product
sectors where suppliers that have traditionally relied on national buying
preferences are having to adapt to global market opportunities,
technological competition, and their own manufacturing overcapacity.
The boiler industry, for example, has seen a number of deals in recent years
involving companies in the US, western and eastern Europe. Long lead times
and shortage of work have also brought changes in the European nuclear plant
supply industry. The co-operation between Siemens and France's Framatome to
develop EPR, the European Pressurised Water Reactor, is an example. Internal
restructuring and reorganisation: the mega-mergers of the late 1980s were
only the start of a process that has led to big increases in productivity
and improvements in manufacturing effectiveness.
In Europe, the mergers have led to a concentration of production of key
components such as gas turbines, and some closures of plant associated with
the relatively unfashionable large steam turbines, or with the nuclear
industry.
This has reduced the problems caused by manufacturing overcapacity in
Europe, although the eastern Europe expansion has partially offset that.
Looking ahead, the big question is whether any further major restructuring
of the European power plant industry is likely.
At present, it is difficult to foresee anything on the scale of ABB or GEC
Alsthom being created. Demand for new power capacity in Europe may be
growing at only about 2 per cent a year, but the suppliers are operating in
a global market where there is enough work to keep the equipment producers
reasonably busy.
But the European suppliers will be continuing efforts to increase their
profitability through further internal cost-reduction efforts, bringing it
more in line with that of their US rivals.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (10): The outlook is bleak but
it's not terminal - The future for coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COAL is coming under pressure as a power generation fuel in Europe, though
reports of its imminent demise may turn out to be exaggerated: it will still
be the largest single source of electricity in the region well into the next
century.
Two factors are at work. One is the policy of the Brussels Commission to
reduce subsidies to the coal industry in the three major coal countries, the
UK, Germany and Spain.
The other is the steady tightening of environmental regulation. On one level
this is reflected in the international commitments made at the Rio Earth
Summit to cut down emissions of carbon dioxide, much of which is produced
from power generation. On another, there is a raft of EC and national
regulation aimed at reducing output of sulphur and nitrous oxides which are
said to cause acid rain and other damage. Again, coal-fired power is partly
to blame.
The main piece of EC regulation is the 1988 Large Combustion Plants
Directive which sets emission ceilings extending into the next century. This
directive is due to be reviewed next year, and the chances are that the
ceilings will be lowered, putting further pressure on coal-fired power.
These trends are at their most stark in the UK which has the largest coal
industry in Europe, but where recent events have pushed it into a state of
crisis. Today, it finds itself caught between a government determined to put
coal on to a commercial footing, and a power industry which finds other
types of fuel, particularly gas, more attractive.
Although the UK government was forced by a public outcry to review last
year's decision to close down more than half the country's surviving coal
mines, it still hopes to begin privatising British Coal, the state-owned
monopoly, towards the end of this year. Once that goes ahead, there is
little reason why British Coal should not cut to half its size quite
rapidly. All that will cushion the blow is a temporary extension of the
subsidies.
The background to this is the steady erosion of coal's position in the
electricity industry. In 1980, the UK produced nearly 100m tonnes of
deep-mined coal, and generated over 70 per cent of its electricity from
coal. Last year, power generators burnt only 75m tonnes of coal whose share
of power generation fell to 60 per cent. And this trend will continue.
Research commissioned by the UK government for its coal review from Caminus
suggested that the power industry will only need 40m-49m tonnes by the year
1997-98, and that coal's share could fall below 50 per cent by then.
Apart from the government's determination to phase out the Pounds 1bn-plus
subsidies which the coal industry requires each year, the factors driving
these changes are mainly cost.
The newly privatised UK electricity industry views coal not just as an
expensive fuel, but as one whose appeal will not improve over time,
principally for environmental reasons. As a result of bygone energy
policies, the UK has many of the largest coal-fired power stations in
Europe, and the cost of cleaning them up is enormous. Drax, a 4,000MW
station in Yorkshire owned by National Power, is being fitted with
desulphurisation equipment at a cost of over Pounds 700m.
This daunting expense is making the power industry wary of leaning too
strongly on coal. At the moment only one other plant is being desulphurised,
and it is looking increasingly unlikely that that number will rise very far.
Instead, the generators are considering alternative ways of meeting the
emission limits. These include running coal-fired stations for fewer hours,
or abandoning coal altogether for cleaner fuels, in particular gas.
A lot of gas station construction is already underway, and it is forecast
that gas could account for the equivalent of 30m tonnes of coal-fired power
generation by the end of the decade.
The picture on the continent is not so stark. Countries with small coal
industries are steadily winding them down as they become uneconomic.
Belgium, once a big producer, stopped altogether at the beginning of this
year. France expects to stop in 2005. But the larger producers are resisting
major changes to coal because of the employment it provides and the lack of
alternative fuels.
In Germany, where hard coal is heavily subsidised and accounts for about a
quarter of electricity generation, output is declining, but slowly.
Consumption of coal for power generation, currently around 40m tonnes, is
expected to decline to 35m over the next five years.
'It is a very different situation to the UK,' says Dr Adolf Spies, chairman
of the German coal producers association. 'We have practically no oil and
very little gas. Coal is the only resource we have . There is a strong
security argument.'
Germany is aiming to negotiate a new subsidy regime to replace the present
one which expires in 1995. But though it hopes to make the new one more
transparent, it will face pressure from Brussels which is trying to reduce
aid in this area - other than for restructuring or final closure.
A wholly separate question for Germany is what to do about the East German
coal industry which it inherited with unification. Based on highly polluting
brown coal, it requires a vast clean-up.
Spain also supports its coal industry, the costliest in Europe, through
state aid and consumer subsidies. But here too coal is probably at its peak.
Spain's national energy plan foresees coal consumption levelling off, with
an increasing proportion coming from cheaper open cast sources.
Coal's deeply entrenched position will be its salvation for some time. One
question is whether it could ever make a comeback as new technology allows
it to be burnt more cleanly, and production costs come down. Mr Crispian
Hotson, chief executive of Ryan Group, an independent coal company in the UK
which hopes to take advantage of the changes in the market, believes it
could. He envisions a number of small clean-burning power stations of 200MW
close to coal sources. 'Coal becomes an interesting business when they
create genuine competition for it,' he says.

Bronwen Maddox hacks her way through the spreading jungle of green
regulations

ELECTRICITY generation, one of the main causes of air pollution, has been
one of the central targets of environmental regulation for decades. However
the justification for 'green' measures is increasingly questioned both by
industrialists and politicians as the costs of further improvement keep
rising.
The debate about how much to clean up the energy sector has been fiercer
than many other environmental battles because electricity generation
produces some of the most troublesome kinds of air pollution.
Burning fossil fuels - coal, gas and oil - yields sulphur dioxide and oxides
of nitrogen, considered to be root causes of acid rain and urban smog and a
factor in some respiratory diseases. In 1990, the EC's electricity
production was responsible for 63 per cent of SO2 emissions and 22 per cent
of nitrogen oxide emissions, according to the 1992 EC report on the state of
the environment. Fossil fuels also produce carbon dioxide, which has been
recognised in the past decade as a separate, worrying problem. Although not
a pollutant in the conventional sense - it is present in the atmosphere -
the rising concentrations are thought to bring the risk of global warming.
EC figures say that in 1990 electricity production was responsible for 31
per cent of CO2 emissions to the air.
There are considerable national and regional variations in these figures. In
France, for example, electricity generation is responsible for less than a
third of sulphur dioxide emissions as nuclear power - which emits none of
these gases - is predominant. But nuclear power produces radioactive waste,
and its long term storage brings further costs, environmental problems and
political pressures.
Attempts to tackle air pollution have resulted in layers of regulation. The
World Health Organisation has guidelines on tolerable levels of sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides, many of which the EC has adopted within its
environmental directives.
The United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) - most of the
countries in East and West Europe plus the US and Canada - has separate
guidelines and protocols, and national governments have their own
legislation.
Many of the earliest regulations were directed at sulphur because of rising
public concern in northern Europe about dying forests. The 1985 ECE protocol
on Transboundary Pollution called for a 30 per cent reductio on 1980
emission levels by 1993. As a result, German power companies have fitted
flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to almost all power stations, and
are embarking on cleaning up the East German stations.
Britain has fitted FGD equipment, which costs some Pounds 200m per 1000MW of
power generation, to only two stations so far, although the Department of
the Environment argues that this will put the UK on course to meet
commitments made at the electricity privatisation three years ago. However,
the protocol is currently being tightened; following the UK's recent
decision to extend the life of some coal pits, it is unclear whether its
sulphur emissions will fall quickly enough to meet new standards.
The most ambitious of the air pollution treaties affecting the electricity
generating sector is last year's Rio Earth Summit convention to curb
international emissions of carbon dioxide. But energy taxes - the most
commonly proposed tool for curbing demand for energy and reaching the Rio
targets - are running into political difficulty on many fronts. US President
Bill Clinton has been forced by Congress to withdraw his first proposals for
such a tax. The recent session of the European Commission's economic and
finance committee failed to reach consensus on its plans for a tax weighted
towards those fuels with the highest carbon content.
Environmentalists argue that although the regulatory measures of the past
decade are welcome, they do not go far enough. Many pressure groups,
including the Europe-wide Friends of the Earth, argue for an expansion of
the use of renewable energy - wave, wind and solar power - which at the
moment makes up only a few per cent of EC energy use.
However, the cost of most renewables is considerably higher than electricity
produced using fossil fuels or even nuclear energy. A report for the UK
government in November concluded that electricity from renewables cost two
to three times as much as that from existing sources. It put the cost of
electricity from coal, gas and nuclear at between 2.2p and 3.5p per kwh,
although it these figures do not reflect all start-up and environmental
costs.
The report argued that expansion of renewable energy sources was possible
but that it would take considerable government help and subsidies. On that
basis, it said that renewables could 'plausibly' contribute between 5 per
cent and 20 per cent of 1991 levels of electricity supply by the year 2025,
saving around 6 per cent of current emissions of carbon dioxide.
Industrialists, however, are increasingly concerned about the cost of
environmental regulation and the effects on companies' international
competitiveness. Mr John Cox, of the UK's Chemical Industries Association,
says: 'we are particularly concened about the cost of electricity in the UK,
which can be greater than that for Belgian or Italian companies. We support
environmental protection if it is clearly going to improve the environment
but anything which increases the cost of electricity puts UK companies at a
greater disadvantage.' The proposed EC energy tax would be 'an ineffective
gesture unless you get the measure adopted at the same time in the Third
world'.
As the European economies struggle to climb out of recession, they may pay
closer attention to the costs of environmental regulation than in the past.

SEVEN years after Chernobyl, it seems strange that nuclear power is growing
in importance in Russia.
In contrast to the US, where alternative technologies using gas and
clean-coal combustion are driving power sector expansions, Russia remains
wedded to its nuclear industry.
According to a survey by Siemens, nuclear power will apparently account for
18.7 per cent of a greatly increased demand by 2010, compared with 10.9 per
cent in 1990.
In March, the Russian Ecology Ministry even gave approval for the finish of
the 60 per cent complete unit No 5 at Kursk, 500 kms south of Moscow.
Kursk No 5 is an RBMK reactor, similar in design to those of Chernobyl. It
has, apparently, been thoroughly modernised and enhanced with new safety
features.
Chernobyl, of course, is in the Ukraine, whose people, along with those of
Belarus, suffered most from the disaster. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's
president, recently revealed that 11m people had been treated in some way
for effects of the radiation. Yet the remaining plants on the site are still
in operation.
The Ukrainian local authorities cannot afford to shut them down, while the
station managing director, Nykola Sorokin, believes that they have been
sufficiently improved so as to be substantially safer than many other plants
in the former Soviet Union.
Worries continue about the cracking sarcophagus over the ruined reactor and
about the impact of a rising water table underneath. Yet the site remains in
production.
The Ukraine may indeed lift its ban on building new reactors shortly. The
government is under strong pressure to start the nearly complete reactor at
Rovno.
Even in Belarus, where there are no reactors at all and resistance to
building them is extremely strong for obvious reasons, the government has
plans to build two, but has yet to find a site.
In Armenia, the French nuclear consultancy Framatome is helping assess two
408MW VVER reactors for refurbishment. These were closed after the 1988
earthquake on safety grounds. Now the Armenia government is desperate to
reopen them - electricity supplies in the Republic are available for less
than one hour a day.
Russia's own intended increase in nuclear power does not flow from the same
economic motives as those of Armenia or the Ukraine. Russian electricity
demand fell in 1992 by 5 per cent. Equally, Russia has the world's largest
gas reserves, substantial supplies of oil and more than 400 years of coal
supplies at current rates of extraction.
In contrast, both Armenia and the Ukraine have had to adjust to rapid
increases in fossil fuel prices on which the bulk of their power supply
depends.
As things stand, 73.3 per cent of Russia's 213GW of power capacity is fossil
fuel-fired, 20.3 per cent is hydropower and only 9.5 per cent is nuclear.
At present, the nuclear sector has nine plants, with 28 reactors, amounting
to 20 GW. Prior to the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet government had planned
to more than double this capacity in order to provide the USSR with a20 per
cent level of nuclear electricity by 2000 and increasing thereafter.
After Chernobyl work was stopped on more than 74 new plants either under
construction or planned throughout the USSR. The new plans are not as
extensive as this.
Ten new reactors are under construction in Russia itself, amounting to
8,600MW as well as 3,000MW in the rest of the C1S area. A further 7,600MW
are at the planning stage. Of these, three, at Balakovo, Kursk and Kalinin,
are due to be finished by the end of 1995, according to the Ministry of Atom
Power (Minatom). A further eight are due to come on line before 2000.
In a curious way, the fear about safety in Russian designed reactors has
actually aided the role of nuclear power in Russia. As a Friends of the
Earth Report, Dangerous Liaisons, pointed out last December, western nuclear
companies were among the first industrial sectors to seek work in both
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The process of getting bilateral
aid from the west was greatly aided by the fear that Chernobyl could happen
again.
As the state of former Soviet waste disposal plant was revealed, this too
attracted western company interest.
In 1991, nearly half of the EC's TACIS technical aid programme for energy in
the CIS went on nuclear safety; a figure of Ecu54m. Most of this was spent
on 'operational safety' rather than physical upgrading on the RBMKs and
virtually all of it went to western companies. Money spent on energy saving
measures amounted to Ecu21 million.
In 1992, TACIS ceased to have an 'energy' sector at all. It was replaced
entirely by nuclear safety with a grant of Ecu100m.
Russian enthusiasm for nuclear energy may well be increased by a further
Ecu3.3m TACIS grant to the new International Science and Technology Centre
(ISTC) in Moscow. Funded with additional money from the US and Canada, Boris
Yeltsin has decided to place this under the supervision of Minatom as a home
for Russia's numerous unemployed nuclear scientists.
In the view of nuclear sceptics, this is using western taxpayers' cash to
promote a technology in Russia that is not being developed elsewhere.
The anti-nuclear lobby has a dilemma in relation to eastern European and CIS
nuclear power. Few can suggest that the safety issue should be ignored. Yet
it is clear that expenditure of money on safety at various plant is seen as
justification for their continued operation.
The original perception was that many of the more dangerous plant would be
handed over to western contractors for safety upgrading. Siemens put the
price at between Dollars 150-Dollars 180m for a VVER 440MW reactor. Yet
Minatom has now stated that it feels fully confident of its own
technological skills and wants to limit western involvement to improved
monitoring and training, for reasons of national pride as well as money.
Yet if the plan is to go ahead with 12 more reactors before 2000 in a
Russian nuclear revival, then safety remains a potent question mark over
Russian technology.
If the Russians have radically improved their record of 'human error', the
number of incidents resulting from equipment failure is rising.
The preferred solution of anti-nuclear groups, the industry's replacement by
gas-fired capacity is perfectly possible and might even be cheaper than a
full safety upgrade to western standards. Yet such a shift to gas would
worry western gas and power utilities, counting on Russian supplies.
Minatom remains at the centre of a power sector which has hardly suffered
from the disintegration seen in the oil sector. The nuclear programme will
keep it there.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (2): Compromise and persuasion -
Europe adopts a slower approach towards a single electricity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first months of 1993, the opening up of the European Community
electricity market seemed to have ground to a halt, in the face of
opposition by national utilities and their governments. Now the new energy
and competition commissioners, appointed in January, seem fully committed to
reform.
It will, however, be a process of gradual change rather than the revolution
which had been threatened by their predecessors. Compromises are being
sought by commissioners, particularly Mr Abel Matutes, at energy, and the
electricity companies say they are ready to listen.
The utilities can take comfort from the case of another EC initiative which
many believe would harm their interests. Finance ministers last month
damaged the prospects for an EC-wide energy tax to fight global warming by
refusing to endorse it after rows over how the levy should be apportioned.
With the UK government and most utility companies opposed to a levy, some EC
officials believe it may take years to implement an energy tax.
Implementation of the energy market will similarly be difficult but the
process is back on track in a diluted form which at least tackles the thorny
issue of allowing utility companies to sell directly to customers in other
countries.
Third party access (TPA), as this form of liberalisation is called, has long
been backed by commissioners who argue that a free market in all goods can
only be achieved if the primary industrial source of electricity is
subjected to the same treatment. Allowing full trade between electricity
companies and consumers would tackle monopolies and force a cut in power
prices, they say.
The first move to liberalisation was the Transit Directive, in force since
July 1991, which forced utility companies to extend high voltage networks
beyond their areas. Another directive sought transparency of pricing by
obliging companies to publish prices.
As the next stage, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, Mr Matutes's predecessor, had
planned to break up the monopolies using the EC's special powers, but he was
forced to desist. Instead, he sought to attack the monopolies by demolishing
exclusive rights to generate electricity and obliging them to unbundle their
accounts so that the various segments (generation, distribution, contracting
etc.) operate more autonomously. This would make it easier for outsiders to
gauge the market and compete.
He also proposed that large consumers - for example, steel, chemicals and
fertiliser companies - should be granted access to energy networks by the
beginning of this year. If successful, the right to buy electricity from
anywhere in Europe would have been extended to smaller consumers from
January 1, 1996.
It was not. Only Britain was wholly in favour of the proposals. Other states
expressed cautious approval for accounts transparency and ending monopolies
over electricity production. But Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Luxembourg
are still strongly opposed to the principle of TPA.
Part of the problem is that, apart from Britain, most countries see
electricity as a natural monopoly. National policy decides price, with
different internal constraints leading to different price structures.
Even Spain, which is liberalising its internal electricity supply, is
against third party access. 'Security of supply is the responsibility of
each member country, not the Commission,' says Mr Ramon Perez Simarro,
secretary general of energy in the industry ministry. 'We want as much
competition as possible. But the critical issue is security of supply and
that depends on primary energy diversification. We cannot delegate that to
the market as in the UK.'
In outlining his company's opposition to TPA, Mr Jean Bergougnoux, chief
executive of Electricite de France, the French utility, says it would be
economically inefficient. It would restrict companies' ability to apply
equality of treatment conditions in their areas and would reduce
interconnections through which energy is traded between countries.
'It is not easy or cheap to build new lines,' he says. 'Companies would not
be motivated if competitors would be able to use lines in their place.'
In Germany the utility companies are strongly against TPA, arguing that they
would be placed at a strong disadvantage to France which sells its largely
nuclear-generated electricity at prices that they cannot match, largely
because of their requirement to buy expensive German coal.
To achieve a truly free market, they say, all subsidies would have to be
removed, whether in Germany, Britain, France or Spain, but that is not in
sight and there is no pressure from them to bring it about immediately.
Outside the utilities the liberalisation argument in Germany appears to be
turning, with some sections of the government favouring it as a means of
reducing prices and helping the country out of recession.
How can the Commission circumvent this opposition? Mr Matutes favours
amending the existing legislation so that member states will no longer be
obliged to grant free access to the electricity and gas networks.
Instead, users which wanted to buy energy across EC borders would negotiate
access to other networks, signing individual contracts.
Member states and operators would have to justify any decision to refuse a
request - for example, on the grounds that there was insufficient capacity,
the negotiated price was too low, or there was a risk that domestic energy
companies would be unable to meet their obligations to existing clients.
Supporters of full liberalisation need convincing. Dissident states may find
ways of circumventing any directive and there is a strong danger of unequal
implementation.
Much therefore will depend on the drafting, expected to take place later
this year after the European parliament discusses the issue.

Spain adjusts to the reforms from Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

DEVELOPMENTS ARE in motion that could alter the face of Spain's electricity
sector.
The government has outlined a new legislative framework and, at the same
time, the main utility companies are locked in negotiations that could lead
to a far reaching reordering of their assets.
The moves are, on one level, a response to Community directives on the
internal energy market and to recent legislative initiatives in the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK. At another level they seek to
replace the existing quota and price structure system, known as the stable
framework, which parcelled out the markets and which expires next year.
The government's policy is twofold. The draft bill seeks to liberalise the
sector and usher in competivity which is essentially what the Community's
directives are about and what comparative legislation in other EC nations
aims to establish. The government also seeks to put a new framework in place
that will ensure a domestic energy supply that is both secure and
diversified.
The domestic electricity generators have a different mission. Up to now they
existed, more or less cosily, within a domestic market where the regulatory
guidelines of the stable framework allowed sufficient room for each to make
money. Now, with the onset of more competitive times, it is a question of
hanging together so as to avoid hanging separately.
It is in this spirit that Iberdrola, the main private sector utility,
appears to have buried a series of past quarrels with its rival generator
Endesa, which is state-owned. These are the twin giants of Spain's
electricity sector and they have grown a lot more powerful in the 1990s.
Iberdrola is the result of a merger between Hidrola and Iberduero, the two
leading private utilities, while Endesa, which is primarily a generating
company, has, to Iberdrola's annoyance, built up its retail muscle by
becoming a strong shareholder in smaller private utilities such as
Sevillana, the distributor in the south of Spain.
Together Iberdrola and Endesa now represent around 80 per cent of domestic
consumption and they split this market share evenly down the middle. Quite
understandably both the domestic giants are loath to allow any weakening in
their respective empires under the new government framework.
Already the two utilities have secured foreign alliances in what is a sure
pointer towards the future cross-border shape of the European energy sector.
Belgium's Tractebel has a 3 per cent stake in Iberdrola and Endesa has
recently acquired a 2 per cent shareholding in RWE of Germany.
The alliances are still in their relative infancy but, as they mature, they
will involve shared research programmes - RWE and Endesa, for example, are
weighted towards coal-fired plants - and joint ventures to seek new business
opportunities, particularly in Latin America. In the near future Iberdrola
is likely to take up an option to buy into Tractebel while RWE may acquire
up to 5 per cent of Endesa.
In the meantime the two Spanish utilities are consolidating their domestic
base. The talks between the two reportedly involve the friendly sale of
Iberdrola assets to Endesa in an arrangements that benefits both.
At the centre of the negotiations is Endesa's acquisition of Hidruna, the
Iberdrola-owned subsidiary in Catalonia. Such a disposal will gain Iberdrola
a very sound balance sheet by sharply reducing debts that currently
represent some Dollars 1.5bn a year in financial charges.
Endesa for its part stands to gain a firm grip on distribution in north east
Spain through the purchase and it will also be improving its energy mix by
lowering its coal weighting. In a second tier agreement, at a later stage,
Endesa could be poised to acquire a portion of Iberdrola's nuclear plant
shareholdings.
Ironically the present amicable relationship between Spain's leading
utilities is exactly what the legislation drafted by the Industry Ministry
is seeking to avoid. The administration, under EC guidelines, wants to break
up the sort of cartels that Endesa, Iberdrola and others always lived by and
which they now seek to reinforce.
The salient characteristic of Spain's utilities is that they are integrated
businesses which combine the production, distribution and marketing of
electricity; the chief feature of the ministry's planned legislation is that
these integrated groups are going to have to separate, both for legal and
for accounting reasons, their production activities from their distribution
and marketing.
The proposed new framework has all the electricity generated by the domestic
companies entering a publicly-controlled energy 'pool'. This centralised
public company will in turn supply electricity to the marketing affiliates
of the former intergrated groups and it will also sell electricity, by means
of public bids, directly to major clients.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (5): Chernobyl's lingering shadow
 -David Lascelles assesses nuclear power's mixed fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHERNOBYL effect continues to overshadow Europe's nuclear power
industry, not just by stifling new developments in western Europe, but by
making people nervous about the industry in eastern Europe.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two west European
countries - the UK and France - are currently building new nuclear power
plants. In the remainder, nuclear power is either in a state of limbo or
subject to constraints, as in Italy where plants have been mothballed, or
Sweden which plans to phase out nuclear power by the year 2010.
France's commitment to nuclear power has long been the mainstay of the west
European nuclear industry. It already produces nearly three quarters of its
electricity from nuclear and has five more units under construction, which
will bring the total to 61.
Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, maintains that French public
opinion is supportive, despite recent press coverage of alleged rising costs
of nuclear power and environmental and safety worries.
'Chernobyl has not made a significant difference because people believe
western technology is safe,' says Mr Jean Bergougnoux, chief executive of
EdF. 'Where nuclear power exists people want to build more plants because
they have felt the economic benefit.'
The UK's attitude to the industry is much less positive. Sizewell B, on the
Suffolk coast, is the only plant under construction and is due for
completion in 1994. At the end of the year the government is due to launch
an inquiry into whether more power stations should be built in Britain. The
outcome is difficult to predict, but Mr John Collier, the chairman of
Nuclear Electric says nuclear power should be able to make a strong case
that it can operate safely and commercially.
What does this mean for the nuclear power industry in western Europe?
Short-term prospects for nuclear power seem doubtful, despite the fact that
nuclear power accounts for about a third of all electricity produced in
western Europe. Fears about safety are strong, and environmental opposition
is well organised. The nuclear power industry has also made little headway
with the one environmental argument in its favour: that it does not pollute
the atmosphere with gases which are said to cause acid rain and global
warming. Some research has even shown that people think nuclear power
contributes to the greenhouse effect.
Instead, the environmental argument has centred on the problem of nuclear
waste. The UK government finds itself at the centre of a controversy since
it must decide whether to give the go-ahead to the new thermal oxide
reprocessing plant (Thorp) built by British Nuclear Fuels in Cumbria. Thorp,
one of only two such facilities in the world (the other is in France), would
separate dangerous products like uranium and plutonium from the waste, and
send them back to their owners. But there is a growing view that it would be
simpler and safer to hold the waste in dry storage.
The waste problem is most acute in Germany where no further development of
the nuclear power industry can take place until it has been sorted out. The
issue has proved so divisive that an early resolution seems unlikely, much
to the frustration of the local nuclear utilities and power equipment
makers.
Nuclear power is also facing an increasing challenge from natural gas, whose
abundance and suitability for power generation has weakened the nuclear
lobby's argument that traditional power sources would dwindle. Natural gas
power stations are much quicker and cheaper to build than nuclear, and are
relatively friendly from an environmental point of view.
Little surprise, therefore, that the World Energy Council's report on West
Europe last year foresaw only a small increase in nuclear's net contribution
up to the year 2005, and, barring a major shift in public opinion, a steady
decline thereafter. What little new plant comes on stream will be offset by
closures of ageing stations.
But the same WEC report said that if public acceptance did turn more
positive, nuclear capacity in the region could grow by over 50 per cent by
the year 2020 provided there were no major accidents, and control technology
improved. The nuclear industry is trying hard to bring about this more
positive trend. An indicator may come in September when Finland is to vote
on whether to build a new nuclear station.
One of the factors shaping public opinion will be what happens in east
Europe where the safety of communist-built reactors is a top concern.
The West has allocated large sums of money to help the east Europeans and
the Russians improve their nuclear stations, but actual work has been held
up by procedural and legal wrangles, though there are now signs of movement.
For example Kozloduy, the large Bulgarian station once described as the most
dangerous in the world, is reported to be in a much safer state.
A number of east European countries are pressing on with plans to build
nuclear stations. The Czech and Slovak republics have half a dozen units
under construction between them, and Romania is going ahead with five
Canadian-designed plants. Russia has plans for some two dozen new stations,
though only 12 could be described as firm.
There is less certainty in other former communist states. The Ukraine has
decided to shut down the only two of Chernobyl's four units which are still
operating, and is debating whether to proceed with others under
construction. Poland has frozen its only plant.
Although East European public opinion is not as hostile towards nuclear
power as in the West, the real test there is whether the region can afford
to do without it.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (4): Britain leads the pack -
Deborah Hargreaves compares the runners in the 'dash for gas'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HIGH HOPES of a rapid European 'dash for gas' in power generation have
collapsed. But the drive to replace coal- or oil-fired electricity stations
with new environmentally-friendly gas plants remains a potent force in
continental Europe - it is just not happening as fast as in the UK.
The EC's large combustion plant directive which forces governments to reduce
sulphur dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2003 is prompting a move towards
gas-fired power on the continent. However, in the past two years, prices for
heavy fuel oil - which is burned in some power stations - with low sulphur
content have dropped considerably. In addition, in many countries
electricity demand has declined with the recession, delaying the need for
new capacity.
The Netherlands, Germany and Italy are the three other European countries to
burn a significant amount of gas in power stations, apart from the UK. The
three continental countries use between 8bn and 11bn cubic metres of gas a
year for gas-fired electricity generation. The UK will reach usage of around
8bn cubic metres by the end of next year.
'There is a general widespread assumption that there is large demand for gas
on the continent driven by the conception that gas is the fuel of choice for
power stations, but when you go through the countries one by one you realise
that there are not that many projects,' said one industry consultant.
However, views vary considerably about whether the rest of Europe will jump
on the gas bandwagon. Arthur D. Little, the management consultants group,
estimates that gas demand in Europe will rise by 55 per cent over the next
20 years from 300bn cubic metres to 450bn cubic metres with much of the new
demand coming from power stations.
'The dash for gas is not just a British phenomenon. We see the power
generation market as being the fastest growing sector of gas demand across
Europe,' said Mr John Wood-Collins, managing director of Arthur D. Little.
According to Caminus Energy, the energy consultancy group, the EC Commission
is expecting the use of gas to double in the power sector across the EC. But
this means gas will still only meet 16 per cent of electricity supplies by
2000. This compares with up to 25 per cent in the UK by 1998 - up from nil
in 1990.
Italy has been planning a significant increase in gas-fired plant for some
time with Enel, the state electricity generator, predicting a big switch
from heavy fuel oil into gas. Plans have been scaled back as fuel oil prices
have declined, but Italy still plans to convert to 25 per cent gas-fired
power by 2000 compared with 18 per cent in 1990.
Germany is currently building one gas-fired station in Dresden and another
in Stada on the north coast. But Ruhrgas, the country's major gas supplier,
has said recently that most of Germany's new power demand will be met by
coal-fired generation.
The International Energy Agency, the west's energy monitoring body, expects
gas to meet 14 per cent of Germany's electricity supply needs by 2000, an
increase from 7 per cent in 1991.
Two plants are planned in the Netherlands with start-up due in 1996 and
Belgium is building two gas-fired stations. This compares with plans for 20
plants in the UK - and even this has been scaled back from earlier
projections.
Elsewhere in Europe, the biggest gas turbine equipment in the world has just
been completed outside Paris, but the plant will burn gas at peak times only
which could be as little as 20 hours a year. France remains committed to its
nuclear programme, and appears more interested in clean coal technology than
additional gas plant.
Spain is looking at augmenting its electricity capacity with gas-fired
stations which will use Algerian gas from the new Maghreb pipeline which is
expected to start running by 1996. Algerian gas will double Spain's gas
capacity and the country's electricity industry is looking at constructing
gas plant. Portugal is currently building a large coal-fired power station
in the north and has no immediate plans for gas.
Eastern European countries are looking to replace some of their
highly-polluting, coal-fired stations with gas capacity, but few concrete
projects are under consideration.
In Scandinavia, Sweden has committed itself to phase out nuclear power
stations by 2010 - nuclear currently provides around half of the country's
power needs - and some of it could be replaced by gas.
The dash for gas in the UK was prompted initially by the privatisation of
the electricity industry and the resulting industry structure, but cheap gas
prices also created huge demand.
The creation of the duopoly of National Power and PowerGen as England's and
Wales's (not Scotland's) only non-nuclear generators left many of the
regional electricity companies eager to escape the yoke of the generators
and build their own power stations once they were privatised.
By March 1991 the dash for gas was turning into a stampede, forcing British
Gas to ratchet up its prices in an effort to cut off demand. By the end of
April 1992, the National Grid was predicting 60 per cent surplus capacity in
the market if all 28 stations which had applied for grid connections were
built by 1997 as planned.
However, since then some companies have dropped out: National Grid says
eight stations have either been cancelled or deferred, putting the surplus
capacity at between 24 per cent and 37 per cent by 1995 to 1996.
Three of the remaining 20 stations have already been opened: Lakeland
Power's Roosecote plant in Barrow-in-Furness, Enron's Teesside station which
is one of the largest CHP plants in the world at Teesside and was opened in
April, and PowerGen's Killingholme plant on Humberside.
The Teesside plant which has four regional electricity companies as partners
provides graphic evidence of the attractions of gas-fired generation. The
station is fully computerised and employs just 65 people compared with 650
workers at a coal plant of similar size.
In addition, Teesside emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant, its
sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous
oxide waste of a coal plant.
The environmental benefits of gas-fired electricity generation are
overwhelming. But gas must compete on price with other sources of fuel and
it is not as easy to transport as oil and coal. The use of gas in power
stations is on the increase in Europe, but a fully-fledged dash for gas on
the continent is still some way off.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (1): Trembling monoliths -
Unprecedented changes are occurring in the supply of electricity in Europe.
Public utilities are being forced to produce power more cleanly and
efficiently, and to clean up their commercial act by giving up their cosy
monopoly status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S power companies are coming under increasing, and probably
unstoppable, pressure to compete.
They are also having to manage their businesses under unprecedented public
scrutiny. Europe's growing population not only wants its utility companies
to provide better services but also wants a bigger role in decisions
affecting that provision.
Later this year France will engage in a public debate on energy. Germany is
already in search of a political consensus on nuclear power which, once
attained, will have profound implications for the future of coal. The UK
government, having hurriedly produced a coal review after a public outcry
over mines closures, will launch a nuclear review later this year.
In these debates, and others going on throughout Europe, environmental
considerations will play a far larger role than they would have done in
previous decades.
The Rio de Janeiro earth summit last year set a series of targets which are
forcing countries and their electricity companies to re-think the balance of
fuels which go into the electricity market, with gas playing an increasing
role and coal facing inexorable decline.
To help cope with all these changes, electricity companies cannot rely on
the large volume growth that has sustained them in previous decades. In east
Europe demand is depressed by the closure of uneconomic industries and
expected growth in consumer consumption will have to await economic
recovery.
Western Europe can look forward to only limited growth. According to the
International Energy Agency, an arm of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, electricity growth in industrialised countries
is likely to be around 2 to 2.6 per cent a year for the rest of the decade.
Faced with stagnant markets in their own countries, companies are looking
abroad. In Britain, where the most significant progress towards
liberalisation has been achieved, electricity companies plan significant
expansion outside their national boundaries.
National Power plans to invest Pounds 1bn abroad by the end of the century.
PowerGen is part of a consortium which is close to winning a contract to
build a 400 megawatt power station in east Germany.
In other examples of trans-European investment, RWE, the German utility, in
May bought a 4 per cent stake in Endesa, the Spanish company which had
previously bought 2 per cent of its shares. Last year Tractebel of Belgium
bought a 3 per cent stake in Iberdrola, Spain's second largest electricity
company.
The aim is for joint ventures and pooling research resources, rather than
mergers. Nonetheless such alliances are likely to grow as the European
electricity market is opened up for greater competition and provides greater
opportunities for investment.
The pressure to liberalise comes from an alliance of politicians and large
industrial companies who no longer see the production of electricity as a
natural monopoly and who believe that more competition can result in lower
prices.
Although its more radical measures are fervently resisted in some countries,
it is strongly backed by the European Commission.
Trade in electricity between European countries already exists and indeed
has grown to about 10 per cent of the total in recent years. But it is
invariably between one state and another. Electricity companies which want
to sell power to industrial companies in another country find it virtually
impossible. Those pressing for liberalisation say the barriers are erected
by monopolies, to protect their markets.
The industry says it is a special case. Unlike virtually all other
commodities, electricity cannot be stored. This, together with its strategic
importance for each country, makes it unsuitable for the normal laws of the
market which other industries have to face, say the producers.
The main issue which divides the community is 'third party access', a means
of giving companies a right to the use of another country's electricity
network to sell to industrial companies. Opposition from utilities, backed
by their governments, has forced the Commission to reconsider earlier plans.
It is considering measures which would force companies to justify why they
refuse another company access.
Meanwhile, the debate appears to have softened the attitude of virtually all
the players. France, whose Electricite de France is the most obvious
monopoly, is likely to consider in its energy review this year whether
liberalisation steps should be adopted.
But liberalisation is by no means confined to the European Community. Norway
three years ago introduced market reforms which allowed electricity
consumers to buy directly from producers and which made it more difficult
for municipalities to use their electricity interests to finance other
activities. Prices have fallen since.
In Finland, measures have been adopted to ensure that Ivo, a state-owned
company which makes about 40 per cent of the country's electricity, does not
cross-subsidise its generating and engineering businesses from the grid
system which it owns.
Ivo hopes to be privatised in the next few years, in part so that it will be
able, with private capital behind it, to play a larger part in the European
electricity market.
Attempts to throw off state shackles are also being made in countries
previously dominated by the Soviet Union. Russia is looking at allowing
private sector, including foreign, funds to help build the electricity
sector.
The Czech Republic has already decided it needs foreign aid to develop its
industry. CEZ, the dominant Czech producer which was partially privatised
through the sale of 30 per cent of its capital last year, estimates it needs
to invest Dollars 5.7bn in the next few years, and can only do so if foreign
funds are tapped.
Although investment in new plant accounts for much of the total, about
Dollars 1.9bn is needed to pay for air pollution equipment demanded by
stricter environmental laws. This highlights a problem for all electricity
companies, particularly those with a high coal burn.
Environmental problems are most acute in east Europe, where governments and
companies are having to cope with years of neglect by their predecessors.
Enormous question marks hang over the safety of nuclear power stations built
with Soviet technology; and big bills are accruing on the mess caused by the
failure to clean up after opencast mining, particularly of lignite coal. The
cost of cleaning up after lignite mines in east Germany, for example, is
about DM30bn.
This consideration, together with problems over sulphur and carbon dioxide
emissions, is behind a move away from coal in some European countries,
notably the UK.
In the UK the move is helped by plentiful supplies of gas. Other countries
are less fortunate. States formerly in the political shadow of the Soviet
Union are reluctant to commit themselves to gas imported from Russia,
because they want to loosen their ties with that country and because of
fears about its political instability. It was partly for that reason that
the Czech Republic this year chose to go ahead with building a second
nuclear plant in spite of public fears following the Chernobyl accident.
Other countries, including Germany and Spain, will not even allow some of
their already constructed nuclear plants to make electricity, let alone
build new ones.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Technology: Fighting on foreign soil - US defence
contractors find they have to work hard to compete in the civilian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a bid to ease the US defence industry's suffering over more military
spending cuts, President Bill Clinton has been zealously promoting the
concept of 'dual use' - the civilian and commercial use of technologies
originally developed for the Pentagon.
The administration has even pledged USDollars 500m (Pounds 330m) to help
former defence contractors convert their plants to non-military production.
Yet many groups in the industry are discovering that although the potential
rewards are enticing, the task of switching technologies from the military
to the civilian and commercial sectors is daunting.
'There is a great temptation to want to spin off all this great technology
we've developed in many directions, but we have to realise that there's no
magic that will make us capable of operating in another sector overnight,'
says Ronald Smith, director of business policy at Grumman, the defence
contractor.
The histories of defence contractors are strewn with casualties from the
battle to enter new sectors. Many companies have been trying to make the
switch for years but have met with limited success. Grumman made an aborted
attempt at marketing buses, and McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace group,
backed a number of failed products in an attempt to diversify.
'We tried microwave vacuums for drying grain and flying fire engines
(fire-fighting aeroplanes) but they didn't do very well,' says James
Caldwell, director of industry participation at McDonnell Douglas. 'Our
foray into computer and information systems was also a financial loser.
Attempts to go outside our core experience have, with few exceptions, met
with resounding failure.'
Flops like these have forced defence contractors to come to terms with their
limitations. One of the biggest hurdles facing military manufacturers is
their lack of a strong marketing capability. Many defence groups have no
advertising department, no distribution network and a limited sales force,
making it difficult for them to sell their products to a large market.
'Most defence groups haven't got the slightest idea how to sell a product on
the mass market,' says Greg Frisby, president of Frisby Airborne, a Long
Island-based hydraulics group and defence contractor. 'That's not
surprising. After all, they spend most of their time dealing with a single
customer, the Pentagon.'
Marketing is not the only problem the industry faces. Civilian and
commercial work can also present cash-flow difficulties, as companies used
to getting paid in military-style instalments for continuing work are forced
to wait until after delivery to receive any payment. 'When we started doing
commercial work, it was hard for us to finance ourselves,' Frisby says.
'Defence contractors get used to counting on regular payments from the
military.'
Defence contractors are also snowed under by the astronomical wages they are
forced to pay their highly educated workforce. 'We pay mechanics Dollars 18
an hour because we need their level of skills to produce military-standard
products,' says Robert O'Brien, public affairs director at McDonnell
Douglas. 'But a lot of consumer products don't need that level of expertise,
and we can't compete with someone who's paying employees Dollars 6 an hour
to put out the same product.'
The industry also complains about the Pentagon's stringent specifications,
which are so demanding that they price the product out of the consumer
market. 'There are 15 pages of specifications for ketchup in the military,
and you can extrapolate from that,' says Smith.
'Obviously, your average consumer is not willing to pay the extra cost it
takes to meet those specifications. The consumer is performance-oriented,
the military specifications-oriented. They are completely different
markets,' he adds.
Many companies are now demanding that the Pentagon loosen its requirements
to allow them to compete more effectively in both the military and the
civilian worlds. 'In some cases, civilian equipment is more than adequate to
serve military needs,' says Caldwell. 'The Lear Jet is a good example of a
non-military defence aeroplane that works perfectly well for defence
transportation. In the past, the military has had a tendency to
over-specify.'
Despite the myriad difficulties involved with conversion, defence
contractors say that in the face of a diminished federal military budget, it
is essential to find new markets. Companies insist that non-military
applications can be found for most of their products, and they have come up
with a number of successes.
'There's clearly not much of a market outside the military for B-52 bombers
or nuclear missiles but most products can be adapted in some way,' says Noel
Longuemare, head of the systems development and technology division at
Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Baltimore.
Westinghouse's defence arm, Westinghouse Electronic Systems, has been hailed
by Clinton as a conversion success story. The group reduced its reliance on
defence work from 84 per cent in 1986 to 73 per cent today. Westinghouse
accomplished this by successfully marketing its military surveillance
technology as air traffic control equipment, and selling military security
products to civilian police forces.
By marketing thermal control systems to the oil industry, Frisby Airborne
has made an even bigger switch, from being 95 per cent defence-dependent in
1985 to just 25 per cent today. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, has long
maintained a balance between military and commercial sales, and McDonnell
Douglas has successfully adapted a number of military aeroplane technologies
to the commercial market.
Most of the success stories, though, have taken place outside the mass
market. 'Selling to non-defence sectors of the government is a good option
for defence groups wanting to make a switch,' says Smith. 'One of the things
defence companies know how to deal with is red tape and bureaucracy. Dealing
with the civilian side of the government is far closer to the sort of
business we're used to than consumer products.'
Another option for defence groups is to sell big-ticket items in low-volume
markets. Both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing have been successful at marketing
their aircraft to the commercial as well as the military sector. 'With
aeroplanes, we're dealing with a high-technlogy, low-volume business,' says
Caldwell. 'It's clearly more in line with our business culture than, for
instance, selling laptops would be.'
Still, some defence contractors insist that the mass market is an option if
it is approached in the right way. Westinghouse, for instance, has joined
Chrysler in a joint venture to develop technology for electric cars. 'Joint
ventures are a good way to go because you can join with companies who know
the markets well,' Longuemare says.
Although conversion may be the wave of the future, defence groups are quick
to point out that there is still a lot of money to be made in sales to the
Pentagon. 'I think the main point is that the communication between the
commercial and defence sides must be improved,' says Russ Young, a spokesman
for Boeing. 'In many cases the same technology can be used in both areas.'
Young points to the successful adaptation, not only of military models for
commercial use, but also the use of commercial aeroplanes for the Pentagon.
'Our 707s and 767s were both used for conversion to military aircraft,' he
says. As novices entering a new line of business, defence contractors are
likely to see more failures along the road to non-military production.
Still, companies are learning from their mistakes and are gradually finding
niche markets in which they can compete effectively. 'Dual use' may not be
the answer to all their problems but most contractors are ready to give
conversion a try. With the once deep pockets of the Pentagon becoming ever
more shallow, most feel they have no other choice.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Technology: The best of both worlds in print - Paul Taylor
reports on a system that combines laser and offset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small Israeli-based company claims to have made a breakthrough in printing
technology by developing the first integrated digital colour offset press
ideally suited to high-quality short print runs.
Indigo, a private company founded by Benny Landa in 1977, has spent the past
16 years working on technology that merges the quality and performance of
printing ink and the conventional offset printing process with the power and
convenience of laser-style electronic printing.
The company's efforts have already captured the interest of George Soros,
the international financier, who recently paid USDollars 50m (Pounds 33m) to
acquire a 'small minority equity stake' in Indigo.
Liquid ink and offset printing dominate the quality end of the printing
industry, but offset printing is heavy on materials, time and labour. It
requires skilled operation and lengthy pre-press preparation of films and
printing plates. And because of the time it takes to set up a conventional
offset press, the process is expensive and requires long print runs to be
economical. As a result, it is generally limited to duplicating the same
image page after page.
Laser-style electronic printing is based on the xerographic or
electrophotographic process, which employs powder toner rather than liquid
ink.
The process is used, for example, by modern desktop laser printers and
photocopiers but it, too, suffers from a number of limitations. The
relatively large particle size of the toners results in poor definition,
brittle images and a lack of colour brilliance. In terms of quality, 'it
cannot challenge offset printing', Landa says.
Indigo overcame these limitations by developing a fine-particle liquid toner
called Electroink, which was patented in 1988 and is now manufactured under
licence by a range of companies including Xerox, DuPont and Ricoh.
After that, Indigo, which employs 325 people mostly involved in research and
development in Israel, set about developing the digital offset press.
The result is a machine called the E-Print 1000, 'the first of a family of
electronic printing products', says Giora Yaron, Indigo's president and a
former senior executive at National Semiconductor. The E-Print 1000 takes
digital information in at one end and can output fully bound colour
documents at the other.
The small-scale laser press - which would not look out of place in an office
 -prints at a speed of 120 feet per minute, equivalent to 2,000 full-colour
pages an hour and comparable to the speed of an standard sheet-fed press. It
achieves a resolution of 800 dots per inch (DPI) on a broad range of papers
up to A3 size - 11 inches x 17 inches - using four colour inks. (By way of
comparison, a standard laser printer achieves a resolution of 300 DPI.)
The Indigo press can accept industry-standard PostScript format files from a
computer-based colour desktop publishing package, eliminating all of the
pre-press stages. Each page can be also be printed on both sides (duplex),
meaning that an entire document can be printed automatically.
An optional automatic finishing attachment allows fully finished folded,
stitched and trimmed booklets to be produced with no manual intervention.
Low set-up costs mean the E-Print 1000 is ideally suited to short publishing
runs (500-5,000 copies) - a market that some analysts suggest is potentially
worth Dollars 25bn a year in the US alone. Potential applications range from
short-run 'distributed' printing to greeting cards, personalised colour
printing and low-volume book publishing.
Pre-production versions of the E-Print 1000 are already in operation in
Japan. The press will be launched formally at the International Printing
Exposition in Birmingham in September.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Management: Management (The Growing Business): Pricing
policy pays off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Megatech Software, a distributor of other people's computer
software, was in steep decline. The recession had slashed demand for its
products and staff numbers had been cut from 15 to four.
Largely due to an aggressive pricing policy, Megatech has since established
itself as number two in the accountancy software market with a system of its
own design.
Theo van Dort, founder and managing director of the Wandsworth, south
London-based company, had a computing rather than an accounting background.
But his experience of using accounts in his own business and of
'anglicising' American accounting systems gave him the background to devise
TAS Books.
The system and its handbook or 'tutorial' were intended to be readily
understandable by the small business owner. A feature of the programme is
the ease with which changes can be made if an incorrect figure has been
entered.
Despite an enthusiastic reception by the computer press TAS Books sold
painfully slowly in the first few months after its launch in August 1991.
'At a price of Pounds 399 we were only giving away demo copies,' says
Charles Francis, sales and marketing manager.
In desperation Van Dort cut the price to Pounds 99. Advertised as a Pounds
399 system with Pounds 300 off, TAS Books began to pick up sales, from 200
in November to 300 in December and 500 in January 1992. The price was
attractive but some accountants were still cautious about auditing accounts
produced on the system because of its novelty.
To overcome this resistance, Van Dort obtained the recommendation of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for his system last
June. Sales resumed their upward trend and have since held at between 800
and 1,000 a month.
Megatech currently ranks second in the accounting packages market alongside
larger, long-established companies. It took a 17 per cent share in the first
quarter of 1993 after Sage with 56 per cent and before Pegasus with 7.5 per
cent, according to Romtec, an independent company which compiles market
data. Megatech's sales were Pounds 1.2m last year, pre-tax profits Pounds
100,000 and staff numbers have risen to 20.
User support can be a significant cost in the computer business. A clearly
written manual keeps down the number of customer inquiries but Megatech's
five-strong support staff still handle between 650 and 1,000 inquiries a
week.
Megatech has held its price at Pounds 99, opting to take a smaller margin on
high volumes, and selling by mail order. Customers are more confident than a
few years ago about buying software through the post and the low price
encourages buyers to take a chance. Waverers are encouraged by a 30-day
money-back guarantee.
Van Dort says his low-priced package has expanded the market place and not
prompted retaliation from his rivals.
Since there are no dealers to promote the package Megatech spends a lot on
advertising - Pounds 250,000 a year at current rates. The combination of a
low price, an innovative product and attention to customer service has
brought the company through.
Megatech's decision to slash its price, while reminding customers that its
package was originally being sold for much more, appears to have paid off.
But selling on price alone to gain market share can be a dangerous strategy,
warns John Winkler of Winkler Marketing, a consultancy. While Megatech's
main rivals have not responded by slashing their prices, in other markets
price cuts have triggered price wars which has damaged the entire industry.
Once a low-price policy has been adopted it is difficult to change. Van Dort
acknowledges that he is now unable to raise the price of TAS Books although
new, more highly priced products are planned. Surveys have shown that many
companies going into liquidation have previously attempted price cuts,
Winkler points out.
It is relative product quality which builds substantial long-term market
share, not price cutting, says Winkler. Virgin Airlines is known as a
low-price operator but takes pains to provide a high-quality service, he
notes.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Management: Management (The Growing Business): Caught in the
crossfire - Charles Batchelor looks at new export restrictions on machinery,
in a continuing series on red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cardinal Broach Company, a manufacturer of specialist cutting tools, has
spent the past few years building up exports. But in the wake of the Gulf
war and the Matrix-Churchill 'super gun' affair, the government tightened up
the rules on the export of machinery that could be used to make armaments.
These tough new restrictions could undermine that hard-won business.
The need to obtain approval for exports threatens to stretch delivery times
from between six and eight weeks to 16 weeks and more, says Glyn Ridley,
managing director of the Ratby, Leicestershire-based company.
Two recent shipments to long-established customers were impounded by Customs
&amp; Excise at Heathrow Airport on the grounds that export licences were needed
under the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1992.
'I can't believe these regulations were designed to stop companies like
ourselves,' says Ridley, who led a buy-out of Cardinal Broach from Brooke
Tool Engineering last February. Cardinal Broach exports 20 per cent of its
Pounds 5.5m turnover and employs 128 people in Ratby and Biggleswade.
Most export orders won by Cardinal Broach are worth less than Pounds 5,000 -
a large order might amount to Pounds 20,000 - so the paperwork involved in
applying for licences every time would be a nightmare, comments Ridley.
'Our customers will buy from other European Community competitors who do not
subject them to the need for extraneous documentation,' he warns. 'The
essence of exporting is to make it as simple as possible for the customer to
buy from you.'
The problem for Cardinal Broach is that its tools, which fit on to machine
tools to cut intricate forms in high volumes, can be used in a range of
applications, from the food industry to small arms manufacture.
It sells to 34 countries, many of them on the list of those covered by the
legislation, and to companies in the fields of aircraft engine manufacture,
vehicles, general engineering and armaments.
Sales depend on providing a fast response to customer inquiries and a high
level of service, says Ridley. The company responds to customer inquiries
within two days and delivery is normally made within six to eight weeks.
Under the new rules, Cardinal Broach must ask its customers to supply an
end-use certificate, explaining what the tools will be used for, and then
apply to the DTI for an export licence.
Only when this has been granted can it start to manufacture the consignment.
Coping with this delay would not pose serious problems on products such as
machine tools, where there can be a lead time of several months. But on
consumable cutting tools, which are used and then discarded, and where
delivery times are very short, it can strangle business.
'The delay will effectively destroy all our previous work in developing
these markets,' says Ridley, who has complained to Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
Cardinal Broach claims market leadership in the UK but faces tough
competition from Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the US and the Far East.
The two consignments held up at Heathrow are destined for projects where the
main supplier, one UK and the other German, have already obtained export
approval, says Ridley .
He suggests that a solution would be to grant long-term export approvals for
particular projects which would avoid suppliers having to re-apply for
permission for each shipment.
'We have developed overseas markets in recent years, often at quite
considerable financial cost,' Ridley comments.
'We were happy to take this expense on board, thinking they would result in
a stronger company with a wider customer base. I can't believe the
legislation was designed to catch companies like us.'
The Department of Trade and Industry said that it could provide initial
guidance to exporters on whether controls apply in particular countries.
Once an order has been obtained, the more information the exporter can
provide the more quickly the case can be considered.
If a company obtains repeat orders it may not need to apply for an export
licence each time, the DTI said.

issues - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the environment to become the next burden to be placed on small firms?
Quality assurance, in the shape of BS5750, has been enthusiastically adopted
by many large companies, but is seen as an imposition by some small
suppliers who are suddenly required to conform to a new set of rules.
A new handbook, Buying into the Environment*, emphasises the need for a
partnership between large companies and their small suppliers. It suggests
guidelines for purchasers and suppliers when they are dealing with
environmental issues and promotes best practice.
Intended for large and small companies alike, it provides helpful
explanations of the legislation, organisations and jargon in this field.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The banks' side of the
argument - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The banks have been heavily criticised over the past two years for their
frequently inconsiderate treatment of small businesses. But the banks are
businesses too and the failings have not been only on one side.
Understanding Your Bank Manager might be the sub-title of Banking on the
1990s*, a guide from accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn. This is not so much a
'how to' guide on negotiating an overdraft but more an explanation of why
the banks act as they do.
Once business owners understand how banks work they should be better able to
deal with the bank manager and present their case for funding.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Untitled item
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM EARLY morning meetings with officials to speaking at party engagements
until late into the evening, any senior minister has a lifestyle that
generates enormous pressure, Alison Smith writes.
Apart from the stress of office, however, there was nothing to suggest that
Mr Michael Heseltine would be a likely victim of a heart attack.
Mr Julian Critchley, Mr Heseltine's long-standing friend and his biographer,
told ITN yesterday: 'Michael scarcely drinks and in all the years I have
known him, he has not been interested in food very much. He eats anything
put in front of him. He certainly doesn't smoke.'
Colleagues added that his work on his arboretum on his estate on the
Oxfordshire-Northamptonshire borders probably contributes to giving him a
healthier lifestyle than that of many at Westminster.
The 60-year-old Mr Heseltine's political persona is that of someone relaxed
in the face of difficulties which are no worse than those that governments
have survived before.
In spite of that style, however, Mr Heseltine drives himself hard, and has
elements of workload not shared by all his colleagues.
He is a member of no fewer than 12 of the 27 known cabinet committees and
sub-committees which carry out much of the business of government, including
the key committees on economic and domestic policy and on defence and
overseas policy.
His ability to deal with media interviews means that when the government is
in difficulties he is constantly fielded to sound a note of reassurance.
And his continuing high profile on the constituency engagements circuit  -
stepped up in his time out of office from 1986 - also contributes to the
burden, requiring tiring hours on the road.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords will not have an opportunity to debate whether there
should be a referendum on the Maastricht treaty until after the bill has
completed its detailed committee stage discussion.
The amendment to the legislation, which was tabled earlier this month by a
cross-party group of peers, has been withdrawn because of difficulties about
its drafting.
The government is expected to announce today that there will be an extra two
days to debate the bill's committee stage, for which well over 400
amendments have been tabled.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aitken confident over Euro fighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFIDENT forecast that the European fighter aircraft would make a
successful first flight this year was made by Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister
for defence procurement, yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He dismissed speculation that the cost of the project to Britain and her
partners had increased by 50 per cent as 'completely wide of the mark'.
Mr Aitken, speaking in the resumed debate on the 1992 defence estimates,
said the actual real-terms increase since the start of the project in 1988
was about 10 per cent.
Left-wing Labour MPs defied the party leadership in the Commons last night
by voting against the 1992 defence white paper, which was approved by a
majority of 243 (278-35).

FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Conservatives fearful of a future
without Heseltine: Alison Smith on how the party might cope if it lost its
most prominent 'left-winger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISMAY of shocked Tory MPs goes beyond the fact that for some weeks one
of the cabinet's most formidable operators will not inevitably be there to
handle the latest piece of political bad news.
What, ask some of them, if the trade and industry secretary decided to
resign?
His departure would give Mr John Major difficulties well beyond even those
of losing a senior colleague and key adviser.
Any further cabinet re-shuffle would inevitably cause tensions, coming so
soon after the one which was supposed to last until next summer, and which
itself left a sour aftermath.
The feeling of instability would be heightened by the widespread expectation
at Westminster, that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is likely to
want to leave the cabinet before the next election.
With Tory party infighting continually breaking into the open, the prime
minister's task in re-balancing his cabinet would be particularly sensitive.
The right might well see the opportunity to break the 'stranglehold' by the
left of the party on the three economic departments: the Treasury under Mr
Kenneth Clarke, Mr David Hunt at the department of employment, and Mr
Heseltine at the DTI.
But the prime minister's attempts to win over manufacturing industry would
suffer if there were a different brand of politics at the head of the DTI.
Mr Heseltine's re-organisation and reforms would have no certainty of
survival under a right-wing minister, and the DTI's increasingly influential
voice within government, would be a casualty of any less powerful minister.
Beyond Whitehall, Mr Heseltine's departure would leave a political vacuum.
Although there are signs of economic recovery - and Mr Clarke's move to the
Treasury means that the Tories are better-placed to make the most of them -
many MPs still feel battered by recent events.
Losing the trade secretary's rare ability to launch such effective attacks
on the opposition that even divisions among Conservative backbenchers
temporarily fade into the background would be deeply demoralising.
The government would also be left woefully short of experienced
heavyweights, intensifying pressure on Mr Major to appoint a senior 'minder'
or adviser to fill the role Lord Whitelaw carried out during the Thatcher
administration.
Mr Heseltine's reputation was tarnished by the fiasco over the pits closure
programme, but is still deeply trusted by the prime minister.
The coal debacle effectively finished his prospects of ever becoming party
leader, leaving him as someone whose loyalty to Mr Major could not be
doubted even by his critics.
That quality, coupled with his sheer political longevity, makes Mr Heseltine
a figure who could not be replaced at a moment's notice.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq inquiry told of chemical sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT-owned company exported to Jordan equipment of possible use in
chemical and biological warfare in spite of intelligence warnings that the
country was being used to divert defence-related goods to Iraq, the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
Giving evidence was Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army
officer who was a member of a Ministry of Defence working group that vetted
defence sales to Iraq in the 1980s.
Lt-Col Glazebrook said defence intelligence had circulated information in
November 1984 suggesting that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route.
Nevertheless nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective clothing and
armoury and large quantities of a chemical antidote were included in a
Pounds 270m defence package with Jordan at the end of 1985.
The package, which included radar equipment, spares for tanks, and a variety
of ammunition, was arranged by International Military Services, a company
wholly owned at the time by the Ministry of Defence.
Defence sales to Jordan when the package was signed largely fell outside the
restrictions covering exports to Iraq and Iran, particularly of equipment
related to chemical warfare of the kind then being waged between the two
countries in the Gulf conflict of the 1980s.
According to internal Ministry of Defence documents made available to the
Scott inquiry, Lt-Col Glazebrook conducted a virtual one-man crusade within
his ministry to alert senior colleagues to the implications of the
intelligence warnings on Jordan.
The documents suggest that Lt-Col Glazebrook's efforts intensified after he
learned that sensitive NBC contracts had been added to the original
Jordanian defence package.
At yesterday's hearing, Lt-Col Glazebrook said: 'I had an uncomfortable
feeling that there were things going on behind my back.'
The additional items of NBC protective equipment were on a quarterly report
sent by the Ministry of Defence export sales department to Lady Thatcher,
then prime minister, in February 1987. At the time Jordan was negotiating
extra financing to cover its defence package.
In a memo to his superiors at the MoD, two months later Lt-Col Glazebrook
asked: 'Is this another case of IMS smuggling NBC equipment to Iraq in
contradiction of HMG's guidelines?'
The MoD, under pressure from Lt-Col Glazebrook, subsequently agreed to
tighten monitoring of defence sales to Jordan but only after the
controversial items in the defence package had been justified.
According to Lt-Col Glazebrook, the MoD in 1987 also approved the export of
parts for ground to ground missiles of a kind that were also made available
to the Iraqis by the then Soviet Union.
The inquiry hearing continues today with Lt-Col Glazebrook as witness.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Civil Service catering agency to be
privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury yesterday announced the privatisation of Forward Civil Service
Catering, the troubled agency that supplies catering services to about 70
per cent of the Civil Service.
Up to Pounds 400,000 is to be borrowed from the Contingencies Fund so that
the privatisation can go ahead speedily, pending approval by parliament.
The Commons public accounts committee is expected to publish a report
shortly criticising Treasury management of the agency. Forward was converted
to a commercial trading agency in 1991 as a prelude to privatisation.
The National Audit Office last year revealed financial irregularities which
led to the loss of up to Pounds 400,000, including 'significant weaknesses'
in control of cash and stocks.
The agency also faced an Inland Revenue bill of between Pounds 300,000 and
Pounds 450,000 for failure to deduct income tax and national insurance
contributions from casual employees.
Several Forward employees - including Mr Reg Wheeler, the chief executive -
were suspended from duties pending the outcome of disciplinary charges over
alleged breaches of purchasing rules and potential conflicts of interest
over a planned management buy-out of the agency. Mr Wheeler has since
returned to his duties, and will be retiring early.
A senior Treasury official told the PAC in March that the department
accepted responsibility for losses of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m.
One member of the PAC said taxpayers would wonder how the Treasury could
manage the British economy when they could not run a tea-shop.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary, yesterday told MPs that Forward was
now profitable and able to win business in open competition.
Forward made a net profit in 1992-93 of Pounds 349,000 on a turnover of
Pounds 30m. It has 500 full-time employees, with 600 full-time equivalents
employed on an agency basis.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Tories fear future without Heseltine: Alison Smith on how
the party might cope should it lose its most prominent 'left-winger'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISMAY of shocked Tory MPs goes beyond the fact that for some weeks at
least one of the cabinet's most formidable operators would not necessarily
be there to handle the latest piece of political bad news.
What, asked some of them, if the trade and industry secretary decided to
resign?
If Mr Heseltine were to leave the government, his departure would leave Mr
John Major with difficulties well beyond even those of losing a senior
colleague and key adviser.
But a decision by Mr Heseltine to leave the government would still be deeply
demoralising for his party.
Any further cabinet re-shuffle would inevitably create tensions so soon
after the one which was supposed to last until next summer, perhaps
particularly given the lingering dissatisfaction with the limited scale of
the last set of moves.
It would create a feeling of instability, heightened by the expectation that
at some point before the next election Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, is likely to want to leave the cabinet.
At a time when Tory party faction fighting continually breaks out into the
open, the prime minister's task in re-balancing his cabinet would be
particularly sensitive.
The right might well see the opportunity to break the 'stranglehold' by the
left of the party on the three economic departments of the Treasury under Mr
Kenneth Clarke, and Mr David Hunt at the Department of Employment, as well
as Mr Heseltine at the Department of Trade and Industry.
Although there are signs of economic recovery - and Mr Clarke's move to the
Treasury has put the government in a better position to make the most of
them - many Tory MPs still feel battered by recent events.
There are few senior ministers who can cheer them by launching such
effective attacks on the opposition that even divisions among Conservative
backbenchers fade into the background temporarily.
The government would also be left woefully short of heavyweights and those
with long political experience.
Mr Heseltine's reputation was tarnished by the the fiasco of the pits
closure programme, which last October that prompted the most significant
non-Maastricht Tory rebellion since the election, and resulted in a damaging
climbdown by the government.
But even so, his sheer political longevity has makes him a figure who could
not be replaced at a moment's notice.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Humberside and N Yorks face axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMBERSIDE and North Yorkshire counties would be abolished and replaced by
seven unitary local authorities under recommendations published yesterday by
the Local Government Commission for England.
Three of the authorities would revert to the ancient Yorkshire title of
Ridings.
But Lincolnshire's two-tier structure would remain intact, with the status
quo unchanged. The commission's four reports so far this year have in all
cases recommended abolishing county councils and replacing them with unitary
authorities.
Arguing for leaving Lincolnshire unchanged, Sir John Banham, chairman of the
commission, said: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' If, as some district
councillors claimed, there was genuine popular feeling to replace the county
with unitary authorities, he would expect protests. Consultation would test
which view was correct.
Two of the new authorities being created out of Humberside are on the south
bank of the Humber and were in Lincolnshire before 1974.
The commission wants to call them North East Lincolnshire - founded on Great
Grimsby and Cleethorpes - and North Lincolnshire - based on Scunthorpe,
Brigg and Barton. But they would be unitary authorities, administratively
separate from Lincolnshire.
On the north bank of the river, the rest of Humberside would split into two
unitary authorities - the city of Kingston upon Hull and East Riding,
including Beverley, Goole and Selby.
North Yorkshire would be carved up into the city of York, West Riding
(Dales) - based on Harrogate and Skipton - and North Riding, into which the
commission has controversially pushed Richmond, Northallerton and
Scarborough.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Solicitors lose legal aid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW SOCIETY, the solicitors' professional body in England and Wales,
yesterday lost the second of its two High Court challenges to government
changes to the legal aid scheme.
The court ruled that regulations introduced by Lord Mackay, the lord
chancellor, reducing eligibility for legal aid were lawful.
The cuts, which came into force on April 12, reduce the disposable income
limit at which claimants qualify for free legal aid to income support levels
and increase the contributions paid by others towards their cases.
The society said on the government's figures 37 per cent of households -
between 12m and 14m adults - would be affected by the cuts.
The society alleged Lord Mackay had acted outside his powers under the Legal
Aid Act 1989 as the cuts were contrary to the purpose of legal aid, and that
he had failed to consult the society properly before introducing them.
But Lord Justice Neill said while it was unfortunate that the cuts had had
to be introduced, a substantial proportion of the population would remain
eligible for legal aid.
Hard and difficult choices had to be made by those responsible for
apportioning finite resources between competing public services, he said.
The judge also concluded the lord chancellor had been under no duty to
consult the society before the cuts were announced, although Lord Mackay had
been wrong to argue that the society did not have 'sufficient interest' to
bring the challenge.
He said: 'The Law Society and their members have unrivalled knowledge and
experience of what access to justice means in practice. It is therefore to
be hoped that a satisfactory dialogue can be resumed in the near future.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / Union warns Nestle on hours plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU engineering union warned yesterday that Nestle could be heading for
confrontation if it tried to force the introduction of annualised hours at
its Findus frozen foods plant in Newcastle.
The plant, one of Nestle's 26 UK factories, is the first at which Nestle has
proposed moving from conventional shift working to an annualised hours
system, which gives each employee a number of hours to be worked per year,
which is then flexibly allocated according to production needs.
The change, linked to the reduction of the working week from 39 to 37 hours
without loss of pay, would give the company greater flexibility in
determining work patterns.
The AEEU says it would also give it the right to call in employees at 48
hours' notice, on any day, to work some of their contracted annual hours.
The plan for the plant, understood to be making losses, is linked to a
commitment to no redundancies under the restructuring programme.
Mr Davey Hall, AEEU Tyne district representative, said it had been
unanimously rejected at the weekend at a packed meeting of hundreds of
Findus Newcastle workers.
Many of those affected, he said, were female part-time employees who feared
they would be unable to combine the proposed flexible work hours with family
commitments.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Engineering pay freezes for 1-in-5
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one in five engineering workers in South Yorkshire and the north
Midlands have accepted pay freezes in the past 12 months, the Sheffield
Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation said yesterday.
In the year ended May 31, about 22 per cent of the 350 companies in the
association negotiated pay freezes.
More than 40 per cent settled for pay rises of up to 2 per cent. Although a
quarter settled at between 3.1 per cent and 4 per cent, nearly all those
were concluded almost a year ago.

FT  22 JUN 93 / New career advice system urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a new system of
'credits' for careers guidance.
It said such a system would allow individuals in England and Wales to 'buy'
guidance from Training and Enterprise Councils. Tecs in turn would have to
apply to the government for funding to provide careers guidance.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said credits 'will encourage a true
market in advice, raising standards across the country'.
He also called for a system of minimum entitlements which would give women
returning to work, redundant workers, the long-term unemployed and
ex-offenders access to careers guidance.

INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management company, said yesterday it was in
talks aimed at reaching an out-of-court settlement with trustees of the
Mirror Group Pension Scheme who are seeking more than Pounds 11m on behalf
of pensioners, Norma Cohen writes.
Mr Charles Brady, Invesco's chairman, told its annual meeting that talks
were being held through Sir John Cuckney, appointed to head the government's
voluntary trust fund to aid the Maxwell pensioners.
The scheme has filed writs against Invesco MIM, Lehman Brothers
International and Capel-Cure Myers.
Mr Brady said he would seek to resolve the matter 'in the best interests of
shareholders considering all factors', adding he was sympathetic to the
plight of the pensioners.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Import surge from outside EC raises fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORT VOLUMES from countries outside the European Community measured at the
underlying level rose sharply last month, reviving concerns that the trade
deficit might worsen in the later stages of a recovery.
Underlying import volumes, which exclude oil and erratic items such as gems
and aircraft, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in May compared with
April, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Underlying export volumes to countries outside the EC slipped back slightly
in May, although they remain at high levels due to many UK manufactured
goods being more competitively priced after sterling's devaluation.
In terms of value, the overall trade account last month benefited from high
exports of erratic items and from a Pounds 5m surplus on non-EC oil trade -
the first for five years.
These trends pushed the trade deficit with non-EC nations to Pounds 769m
last month, down from a revised Pounds 901m in April and the lowest deficit
since September.
On an underlying basis, the trade deficit last month for nations outside the
EC was Pounds 846m, up from Pounds 785m in April. Figures for the EC are not
available yet. Statisticians are ironing out a new system for collecting the
data.
In volume terms, the underlying level of non-EC imports in the three months
ending May 31 was up 2.5 per cent compared with the previous three months,
and up 14 per cent on the same period last year.
On the same basis, exports in the most recent three-month period were up 6
per cent compared with the three months ending in February, and 12 per cent
up on a year ago. Last month underlying export volumes slipped 3 per cent on
a high April figure described as 'a bit of freak' by government
statisticians.
The better export performance in recent months led to a small Pounds 5m
surplus on trade with North America last month, and an Pounds 85m surplus in
April. This was against the trend of recent years which has normally
featured deficits on this part of the trade account.
In the three months to the end of May, non-EC exports of manufactured goods
totalled Pounds 11.42bn, 7 per cent up on the Pounds 10.67bn for the
previous three months. Over the same period imports of manufactured items
have fallen 2 per cent.
These developments have pushed down the trade deficit on such goods from
Pounds 2.23bn in the three months to the end of February to Pounds 1.25bn in
the latest three-month period. Even so, due to the steep increase in imports
in the past year, the deficit for the past three months still stands higher
than for any quarter last year except October-December.
Over the whole of last year the non-EC deficit on manufactured goods came to
Pounds 4.64bn, from Pounds 2.89bn the year before.

FT  22 JUN 93 / National Express leads airport bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach group, yesterday emerged as the favourite but
undeclared bidder for East Midlands International Airport at Castle
Donington, Leicestershire.
Mr Chris Gilliatt from the Nottingham office of accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick, which is handling the sale of the airport for its local authority
owners, told senior airport executives their attempt to stage a management
buy-out had been rejected.
He apparently refused to disclose the name of the successful bidder because
of Stock Exchange regulations. The only UK quoted company believed to be on
the bidding list is National Express.
Apart from the management team, the other declared bidders are Regional
Airports, a private company, and Lockheed, the US aerospace group.
National Express refused 'to comment on press speculation and industry
rumour'. Mr Gilliatt also refused to discuss the bidding, noting that
'nothing is agreed until it is signed and that means a contract'.
It is thought that National Express has entered an agreement with the
airport owners which gives it the exclusive right to negotiate a purchase.
This could take until August.
The airport owners are the Derbyshire County Council with 44 per cent,
Nottinghamshire County Council with 33 per cent, and Leicestershire County
Council and Nottingham City Council with 11 per cent each.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Bristol print sackings raised in European parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL dispute at a Bristol printing company was raised in the
European parliament yesterday by Mr Ian White, the Labour MEP for Bristol
and Bath, as an example of what he said was one of a series of attacks on
the rights of workers in the UK.
One hundred and twenty two members of the GPMU print union were dismissed on
April 26 by the family company of JW Arrowsmith after voting for industrial
action in pursuit of a Pounds 6.50 a week pay rise.
They were subsequently sent letters offering re-engagement at their previous
levels of pay but were told that the company would no longer recognise the
union and there would be personal contracts.
Since then only six workers have been re-employed and the company, founded
in 1854, has been picketed by the dismissed staff.
The union says the average length of service is 20 years. Mr John Price, a
union branch official, said: 'It is an old family firm with loyalties you
don't find in big companies. It has been a very flexible workforce and this
is their reward.'
Mr White yesterday presented a petition signed by the sacked workers to the
European parliament together with a written declaration condemning the UK
government for allowing such action by employers. 'This is not just an
isolated incident,' he said. 'The problems at Arrowsmith's are just part of
a series of attacks on the rights of workers in the UK.'
He said the practice of derecognition of trade union negotiation procedures,
and the issuing of individual employment contracts, set UK workers apart 'as
potentially the most exploitable in the community'.
Miss Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, chairman and managing director, said the
company had suffered since January from an unofficial overtime ban before
the industrial action vote was taken.
She said neither the union nor the chapel (local union branch) had behaved
responsibly. 'I think the chapel's view was: 'We have to have a wage
increase, never mind whether the company can afford it'.'
JW Arrowsmith, which mainly prints technical journals, says it has suffered
from the recession and made a loss of Pounds 201,000 last year on a turnover
of Pounds 4.6m.
Miss Arrowsmith-Brown said that because there had not been a good return to
work after the dismissals, the company had restructured itself with a much
smaller staff. It employed 55 people, and did not expect to increase that
above 65 or 70. 'For us, it is no longer a dispute. There is no resolution
to be achieved.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / Shoppers' optimism on economy tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM among UK consumers about the state of the economy took a tumble in
the first half of this month, according to the latest consumer confidence
survey from Gallup, the opinion poll company.
The survey, carried out between June 2 and June 15 for the European
Commission, found only 30 per cent of the 1,981 adults interviewed expected
Britain's general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months
while 31 per cent thought it would worsen.
The resulting balance of minus 1, as a measure of consumer confidence, was
22 percentage points below May's result when a positive 21 per cent balance
of respondents expected the economy to improve. The fall in the balance was
the largest month-on-month decline since January 1991, when worries about
the Gulf war pushed the balance down by 31 percentage points.
Because Gallup does not ask interviewees to explain their feelings, company
officials could only speculate about reasons for the sharp drop in
confidence. It was suggested that the government's problems, after the
sacking of Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, could have hurt confidence.
The 25 percentage point rise in the balance between April and May may have
exaggerated improvements in confidence at the time. The latest Gallup survey
fits in better with recent news of falling mortgage commitments in May and a
slight decline in retail sales volumes last month.
On the other hand, Gallup's polling was completed before last Thursday's
surprise announcement of another fall in unemployment last month. This may
be why 55 per cent expected unemployment would rise over the next 12 months
compared with 49 per cent in May.
Gallup also found its respondents more pessimistic about their own financial
position and about inflation.
However, 40 per cent of those polled thought it was a good time to make a
major purchase compared with 29 per cent who thought it should be postponed.
The resulting positive balance of 11 per cent compared with the 12 per cent
recorded in May.
The Treasury said not too much weight should be put on one month's change in
the survey when results were volatile.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Cleaning up with orange peel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCARDED orange peel, especially from Brazil, has turned out to have
astonishing powers as an industrial solvent and cleanser. It may replace one
of the chemicals doing most damage to the ozone layer, which the world's
governments have agreed to ban by 1995.
The solvent, called Pronatur, cleans stubborn materials such as oil and
bitumen from any surface, including human skin, but is so safe it can be
drunk - although this is not recommended: it might smell like oranges, but
it tastes ghastly.
It is made from a blend of natural oils squeezed from orange peel from
around the world. Because there is no scientific breakthrough to patent the
blend is being kept secret, as are the names of most of the countries the
oranges come from, although Brazilian peel is an important source of oil.
Oranges, it appears, have locally determined natural chemicals in their
zest.
Bulked out with an inert paraffin, the product sells at Pounds 2 a litre.
Edward Billington &amp; Sons, a Liverpool sugar merchant and food company, has
spent more than Pounds 250,000 setting up a plant in Bootle to make 1m
litres a month.
The product was developed by Mr Richard Manbiot when he worked for
Glenmarkie, a small Aberdeen solvent manufacturer. He and Mr Paul
Richardson, a colleague, were negotiating to buy the company from its owner,
but were hesitant about the risks of borrowing the necessary Pounds 750,000.
Impressed with the potential of Pronatur and related solvents, Billington -
a customer - has bought the rights to the products and set up a subsidiary
with equity stakes for Mr Manbiot and Mr Richardson.
Mr Manbiot said yesterday: 'This is a low-tech solution to a high-tech
problem. EC countries use 113,000 tonnes of 1,1,1-trichloroethane a year and
have agreed to ban it by 1995 under the Montreal protocol because of the
damage done to the ozone layer after it evaporates.
'I'm a cook rather than a chemist. I developed Pronatur by trial and a lot
of error. Then it was matter of working out how to scale up for mass
production. We reckon we have a two-year lead on the rest of the world.
Citrus has always had grease-cutting power. This stuff maximises it.'
Trials have proved Pronatur is good at cleaning up oil slicks. It absorbs
the oil immediately, forming a solution that mixes in water and floats on
top of it.
'You then skim or vacuum it off. If you drag an oil-absorbing polyester
cloth across it, you can even cart it all off in plastic bags and burn it
safely,' Mr Manbiot said.
The solvent is being used in hospitals to dissolve bitumen splashes off the
burns they cause, reducing further damage to tissue.
It takes 30 times longer than conventional solvents to evaporate, so less
needs to be used. Most solvents waste 90 per cent of their power by
vaporising before they can act - aggravating pollution.
The new solvent has been endorsed by the Department of Energy as category 1,
meaning it is ideal for a wide range of cleaning purposes. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has approved it for use in oil spillages.
It already has approvals from Powergen, Nuclear Electric, British Gas,
Eastern Electric, Rolls-Royce Aerospace, ABB Transport, South Wales Electric
and Scottish Power. Mr Manbiot said: 'We have all the approvals needed for
this to be a window of opportunity to break into bigger markets.'
When Pronatur breaks down it forms safe carbon dioxide. That means it should
also score over the alternative to 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene,
which is toxic when inhaled.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Shake-up for Humberside and N Yorkshire proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMBERSIDE and North Yorkshire counties would be abolished and replaced by
seven unitary local authorities under recommendations published yesterday by
the Local Government Commission for England.
Three of the authorities would revert to the ancient Yorkshire title of
Ridings.
But Lincolnshire's two-tier structure would remain intact, with the status
quo unchanged. The commission's four reports so far this year have in all
cases recommended abolishing county councils and replacing them with unitary
authorities.
Arguing for leaving Lincolnshire unchanged, Sir John Banham, chairman of the
commission, said: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' If, as some district
councillors claimed, there was genuine popular feeling to replace the county
with unitary authorities, he would expect protests. Consultation would test
which view was correct.
The commission recommended, as expected, the demise of Humberside, but
arguments are likely over North Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
Two of the new authorities being created out of Humberside are on the south
bank of the Humber and were in Lincolnshire before 1974.
The commission wants to call them North East Lincolnshire - founded on Great
Grimsby and Cleethorpes - and North Lincolnshire - based on Scunthorpe,
Brigg and Barton. But they would be unitary authorities, administratively
separate from Lincolnshire.
On the north bank of the river, the rest of Humberside would split into two
unitary authorities - the city of Kingston upon Hull and East Riding,
including Beverley, Goole and Selby.
North Yorkshire would be carved up into the city of York, West Riding
(Dales) - based on Harrogate and Skipton - and North Riding, into which the
commission has controversially pushed Richmond, Northallerton and
Scarborough.
The Association of County Councils said the commission had not done a bad
job. But Mr Robin Wendt, ACC secretary added: 'It is not clear that the new
structure will be better in all respects than the existing two-tier
structure.'
However, the Association of District Councils was fiercely critical of the
entire package. It said the new North Riding authority would be unworkable,
being more than double the size of the next largest unitary authority in the
UK.
Sir John said the commission's first-tranche proposals had involved 75
councils covering more than 6m people and spending Pounds 6bn a year. The
commission had proposed 25 new unitary councils, saving between 10 and 12
per cent a year in administrative costs.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Engineering pay awards fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one in five engineering workers in South Yorkshire and the north
Midlands have accepted pay freezes in the past 12 months, the Sheffield
Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation said yesterday.
In the year ended May 31, about 22 per cent of the 350 companies in the
association negotiated pay freezes. More than 40 per cent settled for pay
rises of up to 2 per cent. Although a quarter settled at between 3.1 per
cent and 4 per cent, nearly all those were concluded almost a year ago.
Nationally, engineering industry pay settlements were about 8 per cent in
mid-1991. Recession and a climate of falling inflation has reduced demands
sharply since then.
Mr Nicholas Kemp, director of the association, said: 'The number of
companies settled at no increase is significant. It demonstrates managements
and employees are well aware that the current trading is still very
difficult, despite some indications of a slow recovery.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / Insurance rates likely to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS warned yesterday that further increases in rates for home and motor
insurance policies are likely as the industry claws its way back to
profitability.
Provisional figures show that insurers virtually broke even last year, with
expenses and claims exceeding premium and investment income by only 0.2 per
cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1991.
Mr Ian Rushton, outgoing chairman of the Association of British Insurers,
said: 'Declining investment returns in the future means the industry must
significantly reduce underwriting losses over the coming year.'
UK general business premium income rose by 12.5 per cent last year to Pounds
18.9bn, with worldwide premiums increasing by 13.9 per cent to Pounds
31.1bn.
Most main classes of business saw a fall in claims. Motor insurers benefited
from a decline in the frequency of claims, and there was a significant fall
in fire and property claims.
The value of surrendered policies increased from Pounds 4.9bn in 1991 to
Pounds 5.3bn last year. Maturities rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn
(Pounds 3.9bn). Payouts due to fatalities rose from Pounds 1.4bn to Pounds
1.5bn.
Total payments to policyholders rose by 16.5 per cent to reach a record
Pounds 27.7bn. Life premium income in the UK increased by 8.9 per cent to
Pounds 43.1bn.
Mr Rushton said the ABI's support for the Personal Investment Authority, the
proposed new regulator for financial services, was 'strong but remains
conditional on the whole retail financial sector joining from the outset'.

FT  22 JUN 93 / CBI urges job advice 'credits'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a new system of
'credits' for careers guidance.
It said such a system would allow individuals in England and Wales to 'buy'
guidance from Training and Enterprise Councils. Tecs in turn would have to
apply to the government for funding to provide careers guidance.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said credits 'will encourage a true
market in advice, raising standards across the country'.
He also called for a system of minimum entitlements which would give women
returning to work, redundant workers, the long-term unemployed and
ex-offenders access to careers guidance.
The report also includes a call for improved quality, to be nurtured by the
creation of an advisory National Council for Careers Guidance to set
national standards, and for improved training of careers practitioners.
It says that fewer than one-third of careers teachers in schools have
professional qualifications. This puts the UK behind other countries.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Texaco condemns N Sea tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO yesterday added its weight to the lobby against the government's
proposed Budget changes to North Sea taxes.
Mr Don Bennett, managing director of the US oil company's UK arm, said in a
letter to MPs that amendments to the changes suggested by the Treasury last
week were unnecessarily expensive and would not have the desired effect of
saving jobs in the service sector.
The letter came as the committee of MPs scrutinising the Finance Bill -
which implements the Budget - prepared to debate the government's changes to
petroleum revenue taxes today.
The government has proposed cutting the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per
cent and abolishing tax relief on exploration work. Last week the Treasury
suggested an amendment providing short-term aid for companies worst affected
by the changes.
British Petroleum, Shell and other large oil companies have supported the
PRT changes. But Texaco said the changes would 'by discouraging the level of
exploration in the next few years, have a serious effect on the jobs in the
dynamic service sector which provides the key support services to the oil
companies'.
Texaco, with the Association of Service Sector Oil-Related Companies,
supports an amendment by Mr John Watts, a member of the committee
scrutinising the bill, to phase in the PRT changes over three years with a
corresponding phased reduction in tax relief on exploration and appraisal
activity.

FT  22 JUN 93 / BMA to compile GP survival guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY DOCTORS have instructed the British Medical Association to draw up a
'comprehensive survival guide' for general practitioners who may wish to
stop providing National Health Service treatment.
A motion calling for the preparation of the guide was adopted at a
conference of the BMA's general medical services committee, which represents
family doctors, last week. It was passed against the advice of the BMA
leadership.
The immediate cause of concern, expressed in the motion, is the possible
implication for GPs of the government's proposed re-organisation of health
services in London. This envisages employing some family doctors on direct
NHS contracts - GPs are currently independent contractors - and the possible
involvement of the private sector in primary healthcare services.
BMA leaders believe, however, that the success of the motion also reflects a
wider and growing frustration among GPs and hospital doctors about salaries
and conditions of service. In such circumstances a threat to stop providing
NHS treatment is the doctors' ultimate sanction.
Doctors are, like other public sector employees, waiting to see whether the
government decides to continue a version of its 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for
a second year. If the ceiling is abandoned, the BMA plans to make
representations to the doctors' and dentists' pay review body that medical
earnings suffered in relation to other professions in the 1980s.
With the move to locally-managed trust hospitals under the 1991 NHS reforms,
it is now uncertain how long review body-recommended national pay scales for
hospital doctors will remain in existence.
Mr Chris Wilson, human resources director of Homewood NHS Trust, Surrey  -
which has pioneered the introduction of local contracts - told the National
Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference last week that pay
accounted for about 70 per cent of a trust's costs. 'Any organisation that
says it is not interested in how 70 per cent of its resources are being used
is probably being quite irresponsible.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / Shop rents 'likely to rise 5% next year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOP RENTS have stopped falling and are likely to rise by at least 5 per
cent next year, according to a report published yesterday.
The study by Erdman Lewis, property consultants, forecasts that property
outside towns will experience the sharpest rent increases, with rises of 7
per cent in 1993 and 1994.
High street shop rents have stabilised after falling by 2 per cent in the
first five months of this year. A rise of 5 per cent is predicted next year.
Erdman Lewis reports an increased level of inquiries about letting space
from retailers, although they are still slow to conclude transactions.
The property market is benefiting from a fall in the rate of retail
receiverships. The total fell to 152 in the year to May from 233 in the same
period last year. The investment market is also recovering, with yields on
high-street shops likely to fall for the first time in three years. The
recovery has been led by the out-of-town sector, where yields are continuing
to be pushed down.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Administrators to fight Pounds 8m Nadir share transfer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International are to appear in court early
next month to fight for cancellation of a transfer of Pounds 8m in shares
from a subsidiary in the group to Mr Asil Nadir.
Lawyers for the administrators will appear in the Isle of Man courts on July
6 to dispute the transfer of the shares held by Voyager, a Manx-registered
company, which took place four days before PPI entered administration in
October 1990.
They will argue that the transfer of shares in A N Graphics, a Turkish
printing company, was invalid because it took place at an illegally
constituted board meeting held without notifying all the directors.
The details emerged as the Isle of Man government prepared to acquire the
assets of another Manx company owned personally by Mr Asil Nadir. Hillgate
Limited, registered in the Isle of Man since 1973, is due to be struck off
the island's companies' register for not filing annual returns since 1990.
Under the island's company law, assets of companies struck off become the
property of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major
shareholder.
Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, used by Mr
Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both are his personal
companies and not part of Polly Peck.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We
considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it
did not seem the right way to proceed.'
The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax
avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time particularly for
takeovers and flotations. By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an
offshore company in a 'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was
avoided when the shares were sold to the public.
Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings, then changed its name
in 1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since
then the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns.
As well as Mr Nadir's holding of 800 B shares, there is a block of 97 A
shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify the
beneficial owner of these shares.
Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche
Ross, said yesterday that he had been in touch with the Conservative party
concerning Mr Nadir's political donations. He said he will be seeking advice
on the issue from the company's creditors' committee.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Pounds 27m expansion at S Wales plant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AIWA (UK), the subsidiary of the Japanese audio and video equipment company,
is to double the size of its south Wales plant in a Pounds 27m expansion
which is expected to create 480 jobs.
The plant, at Crumlin, Gwent, is Aiwa's only European factory but there was
competition for the investment from other countries, especially Malaysia. It
is the single biggest Japanese investment project in Wales for more than two
years.
The investment is backed by regional selective assistance from the Welsh
Office. The Welsh Development Agency will build a 116,000 sq ft extension to
the factory, which makes hi-fi systems and video cassette recorders.
The workforce is expected to increase to about 1,100 by 1996, making it one
of the largest Japanese employers in Wales. About two-thirds of the plant's
output is exported to continental Europe with the rest sold in the UK.
Work on the factory is expected to start before the end of this year with it
coming on-stream 12 months later. It will be the third expansion at Crumlin
since Aiwa (UK) first set up there in 1980.

several decades, provisional figures to be presented to tomorrow's TUC
general council will show, David Goodhart writes.
The membership records of 65 unions show a sharper fall last year than in
1991 with the affiliated membership total falling by 480,000 to 7.3m, the
lowest level since 1946. The 6.2 per cent fall in total membership was
unevenly distributed, with the engineering section of the AEEU craft union
falling by 13 per cent to 541,000 but 17 unions, mainly in the public
sector, increasing membership.
The fall in union membership was nearly 100,000 more than the increase in
registered unemployment over the period. But although union density has
fallen below 30 per cent in relation to the workforce as a whole it remains
at about 33 per cent for people in employment.
Britain continues to have one of the highest levels of union density in
Europe but has probably been overtaken by Germany.
For the first time since the 1920s the TGWU general union, with 1.03m
members, took second place to Unison, the new public services union created
from a merger of three unions, which has 1.48m members.
The GMB general union fell from 862,000 to 799,101, and the MSF white-collar
union fell from 604,000 to 552,000.
Other unions that have suffered big membership losses include the National
Communications Union down to 126,376, the National Union of Mineworkers down
to 32,947 and Usdaw, the shopworkers union, down to 316,491.
The fall in membership means that the TUC general council will now have 46
members instead of 50.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Bosses stand firm on political gifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES helping to bankroll the Conservative party appear unlikely
to alter their attitudes towards political donations in the wake of the
frenzy over party funding which has hit Westminster.
The latest allegations involving Mr Asil Nadir do not seem to have shaken
the resolve of Britain's big corporate battalions, many of which continue
unquestioningly to support the Tories with hard cash.
According to a poll yesterday among 40 of Britain's largest contributors to
the Conservative Party, attitudes to the issue of political contributions do
not appear about to change. The message from corporate donors was that their
freedom to contribute - last year business gave Pounds 19m to Conservative
Central Office - and the accompanying rules, are quite clear. Companies say
that if attitudes change it will be because they no longer believe in the
values and virtues of the Tories.
It is up to the Tory party, say many of the biggest contributors, to devise
a system which leaves the organisation and its fund-raising activities well
above suspicion.
But the provision of shareholders' funds in return for unquantified but
presumed corporate - or even personal - reward may now be heading for a
radical overhaul, whatever party grandees may say. Little-publicised moves
to improve not only the efficiency but the transparency of the Tory party's
funding activities are under way and should be complete in time for the
party conference in the autumn.
Many companies yesterday stressed that the statutory obligations on them to
declare political donations were clear. They acknowledged that the
motivation for offering support varied and some believed that the
controversy would remain until state-funding enabled parties to turn their
back on other sources of funds.
While the Confederation of British Industry says the issue of contributions
is for members only and 'not something on which we have taken a view or are
likely to', the Institute of Directors emphasises that the 'law on company
disclosure is as watertight as you can get. We are not looking for any
changes'.
The view is shared by Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, a
Labour supporter but whose company makes no party contributions. He says the
law already makes company contributions transparent but would favour a
mandatory requirement on political parties to disclose contributions above
Pounds 10,000 to catch gifts by individuals, foreigners and private
concerns.
The idea that cash contributions directly assisted the donors was,
predictably, rejected by all the companies. Some said they expected other
contributors might believe that to be the case but their own motives were
usually a matter of supporting a philosophy.
One of the largest insurance groups said: 'We stopped contributions last
year. They were a hangover from the days when we feared nationalisation,
which is now a non-runner.'
Mowlem, the construction group, said donations might improve access to
government but did not offer any more influence. 'Neither is there any
evidence that honours follow contributions.'
One of Britain's biggest drinks companies, however, said that big donors
probably expected honours to follow. Companies, it said, should be compelled
to reveal all indirect contributions.
P&amp;O, the transport and shipping group headed by Lord Sterling, said its own
contributions to the Tories - Pounds 100,000 last year - had failed to
influence government policy. It cited the case of fines imposed for carrying
illegal immigrants on its ferries when it had not been given the authority
to inspect passports.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits, summed up the view of most
chief executives in saying his company - which paid Pounds 130,000 to the
Tories last year - had continued to help the party because it offered the
best economic climate. He would, however, strongly support state-funding for
parties.
Central Office's plans for changing its fund-raising approach include the
establishment of a board of treasurers, working alongside the existing board
of finance, charged with overseeing fund-raising.
It will be chaired by Mr Charles Hambro, whose 10-strong team - drawing
heavily on volunteer chief executives from the private sector - is expected
to be at work 'very soon'. More detailed party accounts - though they will
not include details of donors - are expected before the party conference in
October.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has already laid the ground-rules for
fund-raising, telling Mr Hambro that the exercise must ensure donors are
exclusively motivated by their wish to sustain a party championing free
enterprise.
Mr Paul Judge, the party's new director general, said recently the new
system was to ensure 'there are no nooks and crannies unchecked in terms of
finding those people who might want to support us'.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Legal history made in Melton Medes pension case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF the pension fund run by Melton Medes, the Nottingham-based
trading company, yesterday made legal history when a High Court judge
indicated he would award legal costs in their favour before their action
returns to the court.
The members are suing the pension fund's trustees - Mr Nathu Ram Puri, the
Melton Medes chairman, and Mr James Philpott, its chief executive - for more
than Pounds 7m, saying that they improperly handled funds regarding a loan
from the pension fund to Melton Medes' subsidiaries.
Although backed by the GPMU print union, the members halted the action after
legal costs escalated.
Mr Justice Vinelott, although not giving a final judgment, said yesterday he
was minded to award a pre-emptive costs order in their favour and against
the pension fund. This would enable the members to carry on their High Court
action until the trustees' evidence is disclosed.
It is the first time such a pre-emptive costs order has been made by the
courts. Mr Sean Hand, of solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead, acting for the
Melton Medes members, said it was an important safeguarding of the rights of
the members of pension funds that are controlled by their employers.
If, following the Goode committee's report on pension law, the government
did not support independent pension fund trustees, this ruling would
increase the opportunities for pension fund members to pursue grievances, he
said.
Mr Justice Vinelott also indicated he would support the members' request for
independent judicial trustees to be appointed to the pension fund board to
review their claims once the trustees' evidence had been disclosed. Mr Neil
Cooper and Mr Ipe Jacob, partners with accountants Robson Rhodes, have been
suggested by the pension fund members as independent trustees.
The members are supported by the Securities and Investments Board in a
parallel action seeking more than Pounds 4m damages from Melton Medes and
its pension fund trustees. SIB alleges Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts repeatedly
breached the rules of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation in
handling pension fund assets.

MOST NHS trusts have not introduced local pay setting, single-union deals,
or changes in the skill mix of health workers, according to a survey by
Industrial Relations Services, David Goodhart writes.
The research organisation, which received detailed responses from 33 out of
the 160 first- and second-wave trusts, found that some staff working for 80
per cent of the respondents were on local terms, but they were mainly
managers or specific occupational groups such as healthcare assistants.
Some analysts argue that a crucial element in the government's health
reforms is the more effective use of labour, with local managers breaking
away from the Whitley system of national pay bargaining.
'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given
for caution in making change.
Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10
respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of
respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months.

FT  22 JUN 93 / News at Ten under pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS growing in ITV to move News at Ten to earlier in the evening as
a way of countering growing competition from Channel 4.
Three of the largest ITV companies - Carlton, LWT and Central - are expected
to raise the issue at a strategy meeting of all the ITV companies at Sutton
Coldfield, West Midlands, this week.
At present ITV often has to interrupt a film or drama to make way for News
at Ten. There is then considerable audience loss before resumption of the
programme that began before the news.
The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body, has made clear
it does not want to see the main evening news bulletin moved to 10.30 and
has defined prime time as 6pm to 10.30pm.
ITV would, however, have the freedom to broadcast its main news programme at
any time during that period.
Some senior ITV executives say that Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief
executive, is scheduling some of his best programmes at 10pm to clash with
the news.
Partly as a result of competitive scheduling, Channel 4 is believed to be
taking more than 17 per cent of the commercial television market.
Last week the commission expressed its displeasure to senior ITV executives
that weekend news bulletins had been scheduled at 11.15pm. It said the gap
between news programmes was too long.

'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given

limit on public sector pay also mentioned as a disincentive.
Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10
respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of
respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months.
The biggest changes have been in the area of disciplinary procedures with
over three-quarters of trusts in the survey signing new agreements.
Only two trusts have derecognised any unions and single-union deals were
rare, though most respondents had 'single-table' bargaining.
Performance-related pay was mainly restricted to management level.
The European Community-inspired Tupe regulations, which govern the pay and
conditions of some staff transferred to trusts, have affected about
one-third of the trusts in the survey.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Isle of Man to take assets of Nadir company: Hillgate will
be struck off register after failing to file annual returns since 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLGATE, a company owned by Mr Asil Nadir and registered in the Isle of Man
since 1973, is due to be struck off the island's companies register next
month for not filing annual returns since 1990.
Under Manx company law, assets of companies struck off become the property
of the Manx treasury. Mr Nadir is listed as Hillgate's major shareholder.
Hillgate's assets include a Jersey-registered company, Restro, which was
used by Mr Nadir for his dealings in Polly Peck group shares. Both companies
are his personal companies and not part of Polly Peck.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said yesterday: 'We
considered getting involved (with Hillgate) but on a risk-reward basis it
did not seem the right way to proceed.'
The Manx company was set up originally as part of a legal capital gains tax
avoidance scheme. Such schemes were popular at the time, particularly for
takeovers and flotations.
By exchanging UK company shares for shares in an offshore company in a
'paper-for-paper' transaction capital gains tax was avoided when the shares
were sold to the public.
Hillgate was first incorporated as Wearwell Holdings and changed its name in
1980. In December 1990 three Manx nominee directors resigned and since then
the company has been without directors and has filed no annual returns.
In addition to Mr Nadir's shareholding of 800 B shares there is a block of
97 A shares held by a nominee company. It has not been possible to identify
the beneficial owner of these shares.
Polly Peck also placed its group of five Voyager companies in the Isle of
Man, which are the subject of litigation in the Manx courts.
Polly Peck administrators are trying to reclaim shares in Voyager believed
to be worth about Pounds 8m that were transferred to Mr Nadir a few days
before the administrators were appointed.
They claim the share transfer was not valid as they alleged the resolution
ordering it was made at an illegally-constituted meeting in northern Cyprus.
The case is due to be heard on July 6 in an Isle of Man court.
Meanwhile, Mr Christopher Morris, administrator to Polly Peck at Touche
Ross, said yesterday that he had been in correspondence with the
Conservative party concerning Mr Nadir's political donations.
He said he would seek advice on the issue soon from the company's creditors'
committee.

FT  22 JUN 93 / A get-tough minister tackles Mission Impossible: 'I will
fight to the best of my abilities' - Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's new
finance minister, gave Christina Lamb a flying interview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso discovered that he had been named Brazil's
finance minister, during a trip to New York as foreign minister, he jokingly
asked for political asylum at Kennedy Airport.
Managing the world's ninth-largest economy is no easy task at the best of
times but - with annual inflation of 1,500 per cent, an obstreperous
Congress, and a mercurial president who has disposed of three finance
ministers since December - it seems more like Mission Impossible.
'I think this is the worst job in Brazil, worse even than being president,
as he can blame me,' said the sociology professor and senator, in an
interview with the Financial Times on his 62nd birthday. 'But I will fight
to the best of my abilities.'
Although Mr Cardoso has kept smiling since taking office last month, he is
acutely conscious of the weight of expectations upon him. The irony is that
the man who, during the military regime of 1964-85 was persecuted by secret
police, barred from lecturing and exiled to Chile, is now regarded even by
the generals as the last chance for stabilising Latin America's largest
economy.
If he succeeds, he would be a strong contender for president in the election
of December next year.
The difficulty of Mr Cardoso's task has been brought home since he announced
his 'Real Plan' last week. This, the seventh economic plan in as many years,
is an orthodox programme aimed to balance the budget through a cut
equivalent to Dollars 6bn in federal government spending, a crackdown on tax
evasion, continued privatisation, a new tax on cheques and an attempt to
force the profligate states and municipalities to pay back some of the
Dollars 40bn they owe the federal government.
In Braslia, the plan is already being written off and likened to the Ten
Commandments - 'long inscribed and never obeyed'.
By way of listing just some of the troubles and woes - last week, the
Congress failed to approve the cheque tax; alleging corruption, a
congressional commission called for suspension of the privatisation
programme; the health minister is refusing to accept cuts; state governors
are claiming that the federal government owes them money and the Braslia
water and energy utilities turned off lights and water for government
departments which have not paid their bills; one day before the final
deadline, only 3.2m of Brazil's 52m working population have filed tax
returns.
But Mr Cardoso is not one to desist. From first thing in the morning till
last thing at night, he is engaged in a round of negotiations with
politicians, ministers, governors and directors of state companies, using
every ounce of his considerable charm in a valiant attempt to win them over
and balance Brazil's budget.
'Finally the government is admitting responsibility and trying to put its
house in order,' he says. 'We must end this crazy situation where everyone
owes everyone and nobody pays'.
Speaking on board his aircraft to Sao Paulo, and clearly under strain, Mr
Cardoso says he was shocked by the public sector accounts. 'People must
realise that we no longer have any choice but to cut, things are so bad'. He
points out that the federal wage bill has increased 30 per cent over last
year to Dollars 18bn, while interest payments now consume more than 60 per
cent of the Dollars 234bn budget, due to last year's high interest rates on
the government's domestic debt and the resumption of foreign debt payments.
He shrugs off doubts over his toughness, exacerbated by federal hand-outs
last week to the local governments of Braslia and Rio de Janeiro. 'Just
because I'm polite does not mean that I will cede,' he laughs. 'If Congress
won't vote the cheque tax, then I shall go on television and tell people
that this will mean closure of hospitals and schools.'
To demonstrate his resolve, he sent a list of 1,000 alleged tax evaders to
the courts yesterday. 'It's important that the courts act - we need people
to go to prison, examples to be made. The way things are at the moment, we
don't need the Bahamas - Brazil is a tax haven.' Mr Cardoso is also
appealing to the justice system to liberate money held in escrow: 'It is too
easy for businesses to get an injunction so as not to pay taxes. Billions of
dollars are being held while our hospitals are in crisis.'
The hardest battle, Mr Cardoso says, is with state companies, particularly
state banks which have exceeded credit limits by 21 times to fund local
government. Some banks 'pay graduates Dollars 6,000 per month. That's
ridiculous - I'm a senator and finance minister, and earn Dollars 2,000]'
Privatisation is seen as crucial to relieve pressure on the Treasury. The
state steel mill Cosipa alone is costing Dollars 1m a day in interest and
the steel sector has consumed Dollars 12bn in the last decade, he claims.
Investors are disappointed that no major sell-offs have been announced, but
Mr Cardoso explains: 'There are already so many things on the list, such as
the electricity sector and railways, that it is better to get on with those
and do that well than raise new controversy. But we will sell the big
companies.'
Brazilian inflation has now been stuck at more than 20 per cent a month for
almost two years. Economists point out that, even if Mr Cardoso succeeeds in
implementing his plan, it will not be sufficient to bring down inflation
from current levels of 32 per cent a month, particularly as spending
pressures mount before the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial
elections next year.
Joking that, 'if I had tried heterodox measures they would have said I need
orthodox,' Mr Cardoso admits that he may have to take further measures. 'I
never committed myself to reduce inflation with this programe - I just
promised to put the house in order'.
But he insists that Brazil's situation is better than it looks: 'We've
become very defeatist but, in fact, if you ignore public accounts, then our
economy is going well. The harvest is good, exports are Dollars 40bn,
reserves are over Dollars 20bn, companies are well-capitalised and the
economy should grow 3.5 per cent this year'.
He is confident of securing a new accord with the International Monetary
Fund, saying, 'aren't we finally doing exactly what they ask?'
Mr Cardoso denies he has presidential ambitions, saying he would prefer to
return to Cambridge University, where he was once a professor. Pointing out
that he never even wanted to be finance minister, he asks: 'If I really
managed to clear up this mess, would I need to do anything else in my life?'

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Chinese delegation on Gulf tour

MR LI LANQING, a Chinese vice-premier, has begun a tour of the Gulf region
at the head of a delegation aimed at cementing trade ties that last year
were worth more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
Mr Li will be accompanied by officials of some of China's leading trading
and industrial companies, including the China National Petroleum Engineering
Construction Corporation.
Mr Li told the official Business Weekly that his delegation would meet
counterparts in Iran and member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council to
discuss trade, labour co-operation, contract engineering and investment.
The paper quoted figures from China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation showing trade between China and members of the GCC - the United
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait - grew by more
than 20 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last
year.
China's exports to GCC states in 1992 were worth Dollars 1.1bn; imports
reached Dollars 600m. Trade with Iran topped Dollars 400m. Mr Li told
Business Weekly that current trade volume was small compared with 'the huge
potential'. China's need for oil products matched market opportunities in
Gulf states for textiles, foodstuffs, light industrial goods, technology and
machinery manufactured in China, he said.
China announced a Dollars 30bn shopping list for technology imports
yesterday which it hopes will boost its drive to join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), Reuter reports from Beijing.
Mr Liu Shanzai, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation,
said the import buying plan would stretch over the next seven years and
include equipment for projects in agriculture, infrastructure and energy.
'This is a concrete step by the Chinese government to enhance the
transparency of foreign trade policy in line with the requirement of
resuming contracting party status in Gatt,' Mr Liu told reporters.
The announcement, made jointly by the ministry and the State Planning
Commission, was the first time Beijing has publicised state buying plans so
far in advance.
Mr Liu said the import scheme was valued at about Dollars 30bn, most of
which would be funnelled into purchases for capital construction projects
and technological renovation.
The ministry plan covers 210 projects ranging from irrigation networks and
hydropower stations to roads, harbours, airports, optical fibre
communications systems and education programmes.

FT  22 JUN 93 / US Supreme Court upholds policy of forcibly returning
refugees to Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday upheld the policy of successive US
administrations authorising the forcible return of would-be refugees from
Haiti intercepted on the high seas.
Justice John Paul Stevens, for the 8:1 court majority, said the policy did
not violate US immigration policy or any international treaty. Justice Harry
Blackmun, the sole dissenter, argued that the law was clear - 'vulnerable
refugees shall not be returned.'
The court ruling ends one phase of the controversy over Haitian refugees.
President Bill Clinton came to office promising to reverse the exclusionary
policies of his predecessor, but changed his mind, citing the same
humanitarian reasons as had President George Bush - specifically the risk
that many Haitians in unseaworthy vessels would be lost at sea. An estimated
37,000 Haitians have sought asylum in the US.
However, two weeks ago, the Clinton administration softened its approach and
decided not to challenge a lower federal court order that about 150 Haitians
infected with the Aids virus be released from the US naval base at
Guantanamo, Cuba, and be allowed into the US pending processing of asylum
applications.
Simultaneously, the US has supported international mediation designed to
restore democracy to Haiti following the military overthrow of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. Further sanctions against the military
regime in Port-au-Prince, including an oil embargo, may be enacted by the UN
this week.
To some degree, the case of Haiti has been superseded by concerns over a new
wave of illegal immigration from China. Last Friday, Mr Clinton, appointed
an expert in the field, Ms Doris Meissner, commissioner of the much
criticised Immigration and Naturalisation Service, and promised new
initiatives to halt the smuggling into the US of illegal aliens.
These will be aimed partly at the criminal syndicates apparently responsible
for shipping poor Chinese to the US. They will also include speedier
handling of asylum cases and possibly the detention of suspected illegal
immigrants pending resolution of their cases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PERUVIAN delegation headed by Mr Jorge Camet, economy minister, hopes by
the end of today to have secured pledges totalling Dollars 100m to support
the government's stepped-up poverty alleviation programme.
Peruvian officials in Paris are lobbying representatives from 10
industrialised countries and multilateral organisations with the message
that the heaviest costs of the country's stabilisation and structural
adjustment programme, applied since 1990, have fallen upon Peru's poorest.
Over 12m Peruvians (53 per cent of the population) are now classified as in
'critical' poverty. In some rural areas, that percentage is higher.
The infant mortality rate, at 82 per 1,000 kive births, is the third highest
in Latin America, behind only Bolivia and Haiti; 49 per cent of Peruvian
children under the age of five are suffering malnutrition, and 9,000 a year
die of it. In many rural areas, only 20 per cent of houses have piped water
and sewage. All this has fuelled disease, particularly the recent cholera
epidemic.
Current poverty allev-iation efforts involve a social fund known as
Foncodes. It finances small infrastructure projects, mostly for drinking
water and sewage installations, and for building simple classrooms and
health posts in outlying communities.
With Peru's economy now on a more even keel, the government of President
Alberto Fujimori is budgeting between 1 and 1.5 per cent of annual gross
domestic product for poverty alleviation. Foncodes is planned to receive the
equivalent of Dollars 500m between now and 1995 - Dollars 200m from the
treasury, Dollars 200m in multilateral credits and Dollars 100m in
donations.
Peru moved a step nearer its target of a single, 15 per cent import tariff
last week with cuts in duties on a range of luxury goods from 25 per cent to
15 per cent. About 97 per cent of all imports now enter Peru at 15 per cent.
The move was largely aimed at curbing continued high levels of smuggling.
Once sales and luxury tax is added to the 15 per cent import duty, total tax
may reach 60 per cent, making smuggling attractive.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Thais make a mess of their muddling -
Motorway contract row unsettles investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES and VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI government's decision recently to flout a Dollars 1bn contract for
an elevated motorway in Bangkok has unsettled international bankers and will
make it harder to finance planned infrastructure projects worth at least
Dollars 30bn, bankers and businessmen say.
The row over the so-called 'Second-Stage Expressway' has undermined the
reputation of Thai technocrats for being able to muddle their way through
the country's widespread corruption and near-impenetrable bureaucracy to
keep the economy thriving.
Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL), a construction consortium led by Kumagai
Gumi of Japan and financed by Thai and foreign banks, signed a 30-year
contract to build and operate the new road with the state-owned Expressway
and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) in 1988.
With the first 20km section of the road all but complete, consortium members
and lenders accuse the government of breaching the agreement on several
counts, especially by refusing to allow the operators to charge the Bt30 (78
pence) toll for cars clearly specified in the contract; the government says
the toll will be 20 baht.
'If we had known that these would have been the terms of the contract there
would have been no deal and no money. It's as simple as that,' said one
foreign banker involved in the deal.
'No one plays around with project financing deals, not the Philippines, not
China, no one, because they know that if they do, then at the very least it
will cost the country more to get funding in the future,' he said.
Thailand has a record of military coups and rapid changes of government, and
projects approved by one government have often been dismissed or altered by
the next on the grounds of corruption or unsuitability.
But the expressway decision is unusual because the breach of contract is so
blatant and because it has infuriated the Japanese, the leading foreign
investors in Thailand. For once the Thais cannot claim that the dispute
results from the failure of inflexible westerners to understand the 'Asian
way' of doing business.
Even before the second-stage expressway row came to a head another Japanese
construction group, Obayashi, decided to throw in the towel after more than
two years of negotiations to build Bangkok's third-stage expressway.
Bankers to Obayashi said the company was bewildered by the number of
government agencies responsible for road transport, which forestalled any
agreement on a route for the road and made it impossible to raise money for
the purchase of land.
Meanwhile, the Dollars 500m, two-thirds completed Don Muang tollway - which
runs between central Bangkok and the airport - is running into financing
problems because its bankers are loath to lend more money for cost overruns
during a continuous battle with the government over the terms of the
contract.
'The government of Thailand is considered less and less a reliable partner
and that makes it difficult to get money,' says Mr Hans Roth, Don Muang
Tollway's general manager.
Foreign bankers have also given a lukewarm reception to a project by
Tanayong, a local property company, to arrange the building of an Dollars
880m elevated railway. Mr Chai Na Sylvanta, vice-president of Bangkok Bank
and financial consultant to the project, has been quoted as saying that
foreign bankers will not lend money to the scheme until the government
honours the second-stage expressway contract.
With the Thai economy growing at more than 7 per cent a year, billions more
dollars from foreign and local investors are needed for everything from
power stations and telephone lines to sewage works (see table).
A deal to open the second-stage expressway is likely to be worked out in the
end - one possibility is that the Thai banks will buy out the foreign
investors - but much damage to Thailand's reputation has already been done.
Senior government ministers admit they are failing to adhere to the letter
of the contract, but remain unrepentant. They say traffic flows will be
double the original predictions and insist that they will protect BECL, and
therefore the foreign creditors, by giving the consortium its original cut:
Bt18 per car or 60 per cent of the agreed Bt30 toll.
But with the toll at Bt20, that leaves only Bt2 per car for the ETA,
crippling for an organisation which is supposed to buy more land, co-operate
with BECL for future sections of the new expressway and repay previous loans
to Japanese and other creditors. The ETA would have to be subsidised by the
state.
The coalition government's justification for breaking the contract is that
Bangkok's motorists would be angered by high toll fees, but most of its MPs
were elected on a platform of helping the poor and redistributing wealth to
the provinces.
Apparently to appease the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party, which is part
of the coalition and has strong support in the capital, the government has
decided to make taxpayers throughout the country help pay for the new road.
It has managed to infuriate foreign investors in the process.

FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC dumping of farm produce upsets Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders are to decide at their Copenhagen summit this
week to speed the common market's opening to central-east European farm
produce.
But the more pressing issue is unfair dumping of western grain and meat in
Russia and the Ukraine which is crowding out exports from Hungary, Poland,
Romania and Bulgaria, according to a Budapest official.
'For east European agriculture the real problem is here, the real problem is
not the EC,' said Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the Agriculture
Ministry of Hungary, eastern Europe's largest food exporter.
Budapest welcomed the EC's 'very fair offer' to modify its association
agreements with the central-east European countries and shorten the
five-year timetable for lowering farm trade barriers.
Hungary claims, however, that French wheat is sold at the Baltic ports at
Dollars 90 (Pounds 60) a tonne which could not even cover half the costs.
Germany has also increased subsidised exports of beef to the former Soviet
Union while Hungarian deliveries of beef have fallen to a tenth of their
1980s level.
'We cannot compete at dumping prices,' said Mr Rasko, citing Hungary's
budget problems and low agricultural subsidies. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development estimates a 'producer subsidy
equivalent' for the EC of 45 per cent, while Hungary's has fallen from more
than 30 per cent in the 1980s to 8 per cent in 1992 and a forecast 6 per
cent this year.
The former Soviet satellites have suffered drops in production of 25-40 per
cent from the 1980s level as domestic demand has fallen with their economies
and subsidised western producers have muscled in to markets in Russia and
Ukraine.
Concessions envisaged on access to the EC market cannot immediately
compensate for lost market share in Russia and Ukraine because central-east
European farmers cannot shift deliveries smoothly.
Producers are strong in the mass commodities which they sold in the former
Soviet Union, and processed food is generally of too low a quality to make
much headway in western Europe.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT has signed an agreement with Union Carbide of the US to construct and
operate a KD700m (Pounds 1.5bn) petrochemical complex at Shuaiba, near
Kuwait City.
The complex, due to be completed by 1997, will be the most important
petrochemicals complex in the country. It is expected to have an annual
ethylene capacity of about 650,000 tonnes a year. Production will be based
on ethane.
Downstream capacity will include 350,000 tonnes a year of ethylene glycol
and 450,000 tonnes a year of polyethylene.
The complex will present further difficulties for Europe's hard-pressed
petrochemicals industry, where there is over-capacity and most plants are
operating at a loss. World average ethylene capacity for 1993 is estimated
at 73.9m tonnes, while demand stands at 63.3m tonnes, according to Chemical
Marketing Associates, the Houston-based consultants.
The joint venture, which took more than a year to negotiate, will be 45 per
cent owned by Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries Company, 45 per cent by
Union Carbide and 10 per cent by private Kuwaiti investors.

<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S new president, Mr Ramiro de Leon, has announced a campaign
against corruption and poverty, and predicted an end to the Central American
nation's 32-year-old civil war, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
In his first national televised address since taking office on June 6, Mr de
Leon announced on Sunday the formation of a social investment fund and said
the finance ministry would redirect government spending to battle rural
poverty and finance a 'massive' literacy campaign.
Mr de Leon was elected by Congress five days after the ousting of President
Jorge Serrano on June 1, and will serve until January 1996, when Mr
Serrano's five-year term was due to end.
Mr Serrano was toppled one week after he had seized near-dictatorial powers,
and Mr de Leon's interim presidency is seen as crucial for putting
Guatemala's young democracy back on track.
Pledging to fire and prosecute government officials found guilty of
corruption, Mr de Leon said programmes to eradicate poverty, human rights
abuses and injustice, would win support from the country's leftist
guerrillas.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN affiliates in the US provide jobs for 2.9m Americans, more than the
subsidiaries of all other nations combined, according to a recent report by
the Washington-based European-American Chamber of Commerce. The affiliates
account for 7 per cent of all US manufacturing jobs, and pay higher wages on
average than US companies.
A boom in employment by Europe's American affiliates in the 1980s drew
little attention compared with the alarm raised by Japanese takeovers and
investment. By the end of the decade, European-owned companies employed more
than 10 per cent of the labour force in New Jersey, West Virginia, South
Carolina and Maryland. At the same time, employment by European subsidiaries
has surged in California, Texas, Indiana and Florida.
Despite the benefits of European investment, the three-year-old
European-American Chamber and other business groups are kept busy countering
discriminatory measures in Congress, where anti-foreigner sentiment has been
subdued but not eradicated with the fallin Japanese investment.
'There is still concern that the US is not in control of its own economic
destiny,' said Mr Willard Berry, president of the Chamber. 'But those who
propose policies that upset the European-American relationship may find that
they are biting the hand that feeds their fellow Americans.'
Many European affiliates have been in the US so long that their American
customers are barely aware of their overseas ownership. However, Congress
has repeatedly demonstrated its reluctance to share with foreign offspring
the benefits it grants to American companies. Nor is it above employing the
benefits as leverage to force foreign markets open.
The National Co-operative Production Act of 1993, passed this month, relaxes
antitrust treatment for companies doing joint production ventures. American
subsidiaries of foreign companies are eligible for this benefit only if the
principal facilities of the production joint ventures are in the US. The act
also makes national treatment conditional on similar opportunities being
made available in the country of the parent company.
Foreign business lobbyists worry that the act has set a dangerous precedent.
They are particularly concerned that their companies will lose out in the
Clinton administration's much touted business-private sector relationship
and the millions of dollars of government aid to be poured into industry
consortia for research and development.

SOUTH KOREAN officials yesterday appealed for an end to escalating labour

threaten to derail the government's economic recovery programme.
A partial walkout that began more than two weeks ago at Hyundai Precision, a

companies located at the group's huge industrial complex in Ulsan.
Among the subsidiaries affected by the production slowdown is Hyundai Motor,

JAPAN'S financial markets were hit yesterday by mounting uncertainty over
the country's political outlook. Stocks, bonds and the yen tumbled as
investors braced themselves for weakness before parliamentary elections
called for July 18.
The Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks lost 592.11 points or 3 per cent to a
four-month low of 19,212.43, the 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.38 points to
106.91, and the yen declined 2.9 per cent from Friday's Tokyo close to
Y110.48.
Business leaders expressed concern over the split in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the
influential business leaders' federation, blamed political uncertainty for
the fall in stocks and the yen, and pledged continued support for the LDP.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor, urged early political
stability.
While some analysts argued that Japan's surging trade surplus remained a
case for another strengthening of the Japanese currency, Mr Geoffrey Barker,
economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said waning hopes of early economic
recovery meant the yen might not rally soon.
The weakening of the yen comes as a relief for many exporters, and may
alleviate pressure on Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, to
ease monetary policy further by cutting the official discount rate.
Equity investors blamed the Nikkei fall on a technical correction triggered
by the political news. The Nikkei rose 24 per cent in the first four months
this year, but has stalled over the past month amid uncertainty over the
direction of the economy. Many investors felt prices had become overvalued
and the Nikkei price/earnings ratio of 80 at the start of this month did not
correctly reflect gloomy prospects for corporate earnings.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Stampede to reform Japan

<TEXT>
JAPANESE voters, having endured 38 years of one-party rule, are suddenly
bewildered by breakaway parties, reform groups which may become parties, and
old parties with new policies, all of them claiming to be the flag-bearer of
reform.
The 'Shinto Sakigake' was formed yesterday by 10 MPs from the ruling Liberal
Demcoratic party who say they are still fond of the LDP, but would prefer to
establish a new party to leave behind the 'staleness' of the past.
Shinto means new party, but sakigake can mean harbinger or forerunner or
initiative or pioneer. Japanese journalists translating the name into
English have decided to call the party the New Party Harbinger.
The New Party Harbinger is led by a former provincial mayor, Mr Masayoshi
Takemura, who defected from the LDP on Friday night, but has suggested that
he is prepared work with the LDP in a coalition after the July 18 election.
More confusing is that Mr Takemura says he will work with the Japan New
party, established by another former provincial governor, Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, though that party adamantly opposes the LDP.
But the New Party Harbinger is not prepared to work with a new pro-reform
party to be formally launched tomorrow by Mr Tsutomu Hata, former finance
minister. The New Party Harbinger apparently thinks Mr Hata's group too
closely resembles the LDP.
The difficulty in telling these parties apart is that each is running on a
pro-reform platform and has yet to explain such issues as housing policy,
measures to stimulate a flagging economy or how the Japanese health system
should be improved.
Mr Hata, whose rebel faction brought down the government in a no-confidence
motion on Friday, is talking of a coalition with the Social Democratic
party, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, which is still strongly
flavoured by Marxist-Leninist ideology.
The SDP still supports the totalitarian North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung
in preference to the South Korean government, and has changed its name only
in English - after much bickering, the party remains known as the shakaito
or socialist party in Japanese.
SDP officials say Mr Hata would make a suitable prime minister, and yet he
has closer ties to South Korea than North, supports trade liberalisation and
wants a better balanced relationship with the US. The SDP remains deeply
suspicious of the US.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, opened the LDP's campaign headquarters
yesterday with a speech suggesting that he, too, is pro-reform, though he
lost the no-confidence motion last week because he agreed to block reform
proposals.
To confuse voters further, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former prime minister, said
he would form a political reform league within the LDP. Mr Kaifu appears to
have no intention of leaving the party, and is being pushed to the fore
because, unlike many colleagues, he is untainted by scandal and is generally
trusted.

<TEXT>
A CORRUPTION scandal in the Israeli cabinet threatens the country's fragile
coalition government and could harm the ability of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin to negotiate peace with Palestinians and the country's Arab
neighbours.
Yesterday Rabbi Aryeh Deri, the interior minister and head of the Shas
party, a coalition partner, said he would resign after the attorney general
said the minister would be charged with aggravated fraud, accepting bribes,
violating the public trust and fraudulently registering corporate documents.
'I'll resign from the cabinet but I have yet to decide when,' Mr Deri said.
Some officials from Shas - a centre right ultra-religious party with six
Knesset members - said yesterday they would quit the coalition. This would
leave Mr Rabin with a bare one-vote majority in the 120-strong parliament.
'Shas should absolutely quit the coalition,' Mr Aryeh Gamliel, a Shas member
of parliament, said yesterday. 'This is a base libel.'
Mr Deri has been facing the fraud allegations for three years after
investigators charged that millions of dollars were illegally transfered
from his ministry to Shas organisations and synagogues through local
councils which were pressed by Mr Deri and his aides to collaborate. Some of
the money is claimed to have ended up in private hands.
Mr Deri was widely viewed as a force for moderation on the Israeli
centre-right, keeping his party in the year-old Labour-led coalition against
increasing pressure from right-wing political groups and settlers to quit
the government.
The right-wing Likud party yesterday said that without Shas, Mr Rabin's
44-strong Labour party would be forced to depend on left-wing and Arab
support to stay in power, reducing his legitimacy to sign a peace deal.
Mr Moshe Katzav, the head of the Likud parliamentary group, said in an
interview: 'Mr Rabin no longer has a mandate to continue his peace policy.
The right thing to do now is to call early elections and give the Israeli
people the right to decide.'
Labour party officials conceded that the indictment against Mr Deri had
damaged the coalition but said they believed Shas would remain in the
coalition. 'We have already said that we cannot take the big decisions about
peace if Shas leaves the coalition,' said Mr Eli Dayan, leader of the Labour
parliamentary group.

important economic talks loom

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNRAVELLING of Japan's political structure over the past few days has
raised concerns about the country's ability to deal with some of the most
thorny trade and economic issues it has faced in its post-war history. The
fear is that a lame duck government in Japan will stymie progress in
important negotiations from the Uruguay Round talks to the Group of Seven
summit next month.
Japanese authorities are hard-pressed to convince the outside world that it
is business as usual. 'Basically there will be no impact on policy,' says Mr
Toru Aizawa, director of the Gatt Affairs Office of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, no matter who wins in the elections.
Japanese bureaucrats cherish the role they play in forming and implementing
policy. The view from the ministries is that Japan has seen prime ministers
come and go and has lived with coalition governments in the past, while the
bureaucrats have worked away behind the scenes.
'No matter what kind of government is formed, it is possible to continue
building on the work that has been done (in trade relations) in a
businesslike way,' says an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Foreigners who have watched Japan closely agree the political turmoil is
unlikely to upset the basic trend toward more open markets. 'Policymaking is
usually not at the level of politicians. I think Japan has the ability to
carry on,' says Mr Michael Graham, counsellor for trade and industry at the
European Community delegation in Tokyo.
Trade representatives of the US, EC and Canada are gathering in Tokyo for
so-called Quad discussions with their Japanese counterparts tomorrow and
Thursday ahead of the G7 summit. There is no doubt the political upheavals
will provide a distraction.
'In issues like the US-Japan relationship which are so complicated that they
require a political push, things may be difficult,' admitted an official at
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Such issues include the liberalisation of Japan's rice market, the abolition
of tariffs on imported spirits which the US and the EC are demanding, and
possibly the debate with the US over a new framework for negotiations on
trade and economic issues, including a US request to set benchmarks to
measure progress in opening Japan's markets.
'Not having a political power-broker in the LDP will make concessions (from
Japan) difficult,' says Mr Stephen Anderson, visiting research fellow at
Asian Forum Japan, a think tank. In the past when there was a Japanese
concession it has often come from the dominant faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Russian reformers to free coal price
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government will free coal prices next month in its latest
attempt to adhere to a radical economic reform programme agreed with the
International Monetary Fund.
Mr Sergi Vasiliev, director of the government's centre for monitoring
economic reform, said a presidential decree published yesterday marked a
victory for radicals within the government over conservative ministers'
preference for an administrative increase in fixed prices.
He described the decision, which was taken after 'a very big fight within
the government', as a breakthrough for efforts to lift remaining price
controls on energy in the face of fierce opposition from industrial
lobbyists and the state bureaucracy.
In an attempt to help mines earn more from exports, the decree also reduces
requirements for the compulsory sale of hard currency earnings to the state,
abolishes export tariffs for coal, and promises to do away with all quotas
and licensing rules for coking coal from January 1. But the Russian
government's timing seems geared more to reassuring the IMF as it prepares
to disburse a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to Moscow, and to obtaining
more foreign aid when G7 leaders meet President Boris Yeltsin at their
summit next month.
While most other prices were freed last year, remaining controls in the
energy sector have helped fuel inflation, reduced pressure on Russian
industry to become more efficient, and exposed exporters to accusations in
the west that they enjoy unfair subsidies.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the fuel and energy minister, said on Friday that the
government aimed to free all energy prices by the end of the year. But Mr
Vasiliev said yesterday it was not yet clear how and when remaining controls
on the domestic price of oil would be freed and quotas on its export
removed.

NIGERIA'S electoral commission filed an appeal yesterday against a court
order blocking official declaration of the winner of presidential elections
on June 12, Reuter reports from Lagos.
The court order, which put in doubt a plan by the ruling military to hand
over to civilians, has left the country in political uncertainty.
The high court in Abuja, the federal capital, issued the order forcing the
NEC to suspend announcement of poll results. Unofficial and incomplete
returns then showed Mr Moshood Abiola, a southern businessman, way ahead of
Mr Bashir Tofa, a northerner and his sole rival.

THE French government yesterday presented proposals to parliament for
emergency measures to reduce unemployment, including a five-year plan to
encourage job-sharing and part-time working which will be launched in
September. Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, told parliament that
'urgent action' was needed to 'put the brakes on the damaging increase in
joblessness'.
French unemployment now stands at a post-war record of 10.9 per cent. The
first round of job creation measures includes reducing the social charges
paid by employers for low-wage workers. Tax incentives will also be offered
to companies taking on young trainees. Mr Giraud said the September
legislation would involve making working hours more flexible by enabling
employers to negotiate shorter working weeks.
Unemployment is one of the most controversial political issues in France. It
was one of the chief reasons for the defeat of the old Socialist government
in the March elections and has already caused ructions within the new
centre-right administration.
However, the government's efforts to stem the rise in joblessness have been
hampered by the fragile state of the French economy.
The level of industrial output fell by 0.6 per cent in April, according to
official figures published yesterday. This means that output declined by 5.2
per cent in the year to the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest Bank of
France business survey suggests that output stabilised in May, although
demand declined, particularly in export markets.

FT  22 JUN 93 / EC road hauliers weigh new regime: FT writers assess a
Community-wide deregulation of the transport industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT WRITERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROAD hauliers throughout the European Community yesterday began digesting
the implications of what could prove to be one of the most far-reaching
changes yet to take place in their industry.
Late on Saturday night, after months of wrangling, EC transport ministers
thrashed out a deal that will lead to a total deregulation of the
Community's road haulage market in 1998.
At present, EC road hauliers are not allowed to ply for hire in countries
other than their own except under a restrictive licensing system. But after
reaching agreement on the related issue of charging lorries for using EC
motorways, EC ministers decided the licensing regime should gradually be
relaxed until, on July 1, 1998, EC hauliers would be free to pick up or
deliver goods between any two points in the community.
One reason the move is significant is that it means more efficient use can
be made of the one-in-three lorries returning empty after delivering their
loads in other EC countries. But it also makes it possible for hauliers to
start touting for business in other EC member states or to expand
geographically by setting up branches or depots in neighbouring territories.
In theory, therefore, the door has been opened to an intensification of the
competition in what is already a highly competitive market. But what will
only slowly become clear is who will gain from the move, and who will lose.
Among the potential gainers, two of the best placed countries could be
Britain and the Netherlands. Britain deregulated its domestic road haulage
25 years ago, long before other European countries started to dismantle
their quantitative systems under which licences were rationed, so its
hauliers have long since made the adjustment to a competitive environment.
Even so, Ms Ivy Penman, head of international planning for the UK
distribution company Exel Logistics, said companies were more likely to
expand by acquisition than by spreading existing operations into
neighbouring countries. 'We have found that if you want credibility in a
country, you need to acquire local management,' she said.
There was also some scepticism about the degree to which smaller independent
hauliers would ply for hire in other countries. Mr Dick Denby, owner of
Lincoln-based international hauliers Denby Transport, said it was unlikely
that a company wanting its goods transported would prefer an unknown foreign
operator to a well-known local haulier.
And Mr John Guttridge, head of external affairs at the Freight Transport
Association, thought it equally unlikely that many continental hauliers
would seek work in the UK. 'There are enough UK hauliers queueing up outside
customers' premises as it is,' he said.
In the Netherlands, a common approach to European road transport is
important because the country's trucking industry accounts for 25 per cent
of cross-border road freight traffic in Europe. Dutch road hauliers have
traditionally made full use of the international haulage licences available
under the existing system, and for them, total deregulation cannot come too
soon.
The Dutch hauliers hope the agreement will enable them to build on their
strong European market share to capture a proportion of the domestic markets
in other countries. They believe that competitors in the centre of the EC
such as France will feel less compelled to seek out this kind of new
business. Nedlloyd, the Netherlands' largest transport group which has
expanded strongly in Germany in recent years, said: 'Anything which breaks
down barriers in Europe is good for us.'
Other countries seem less enthusiastic about the changes. In France, for
example, Mr Bernard Bosson, France's transport minister, was yesterday
seeking to reassure the French road haulage industry that the five-year
transition period would give them plenty of time to adjust to unbridled
competition.
Mr Bosson said it was essential that 'liberalisation should be not brutal,
but should be very progressive and contained', and called for parallel
harmonisation of 'social and technical' standards in the EC to protect
French lorry drivers from unfair competition.
In Germany, which secured the right to introduce motorway charges for
foreign lorries in return for its agreement to deregulation, the German road
haulage industry yesterday gave a cautious welcome to the Luxembourg
decision. 'Anything which reduces the competitive disadvantage of the German
road hauliers must be welcomed,' said Mr Viktor Kettler of Interdean, the
international removals company.
Mr Herbert Nickenig, responsible for the road haulage section of the
federation of haulage contractors, said the deal could still mean a
competitive advantage for rival national industries, above all the Dutch.
But as more than one European haulier pointed out yesterday, with Germany
vowing to plough the proceeds of its motorway charges into restructuring
Deutsche Bundesbahn, the biggest gainer from the Luxembourg agreement might
not be the road haulage industry at all, but German railways.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CAR bombs in central Madrid yesterday, which killed seven people and
injured 25, bore the hallmarks of the Basque separatist group, Eta, which
was previously believed to have been cornered and disarmed.
Eta received a setback in general elections this month when its political
front organisation, Herri Batasuna, lost two of the four seats it had held
in parliament.
The group could have been seeking to put pressure on the Basque Nationalist
party, PNV - the main political group in the northern Basque region, which
is this week considering an invitation issued by prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez to join a coalition government.
The car bombs exploded during the morning rush hour four blocks and 45
minutes apart. The first killed five senior military officers, a sergeant
and a civilian driver who were travelling in an unmarked minibus to general
staff headquarters. The second blast severely injured several pedestrians
close to the US embassy and the residence of the French ambassador.
The explosions were the first in Madrid in a year, and came at a time when
Eta activity had been low. Several gunmen have been detained recently and
the organisation's commander, arrested in France last year, was jailed for
10 years by a Paris court last Friday.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudolf Scharping, the youthful new leader of Germany's opposition Social
Democrats, yesterday moved rapidly to consolidate his position, announcing
his determination to challenge Mr Helmut Kohl for the chancellorship in next
year's elections.
His decision aims to end in-fighting within the troubled opposition party,
and was announced with the public support of Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the deputy
leader and state premier of the Saarland, who was the SPD candidate for
chancellor at the last elections.
Mr Scharping, aged 45, who is currently state premier of the
Rhineland-Palatinate, made clear his determination to keep the important
strings of party leadership in his own hands, by taking over as chairman of
the committee to draft the party's 1994 election manifesto, under the
heading Germany 2000, a job previously held by Mr Lafontaine.
The new leader will be formally confirmed as party chairman on Friday, at an
emergency congress in Essen, although the choice of candidate for chancellor
will only be formally made next year. He said he would announce a government
team by July 5. His move follows three sets of 'intensive talks' with Mr
Lafontaine over the past week since Mr Scharping emerged as the clear victor
from an unprecedented poll of party members to choose a new leader. In
persuading his deputy to bury his own ambitions, he was undoubtedly
strengthened by recent opinion polls, which showed Mr Lafontaine as one of
the few SPD leaders whose popularity is actually lower than that of
Chancellor Kohl.
In the magazine, Der Spiegel, published yesterday, a poll suggested that Mr
Scharping would narrowly defeat Mr Kohl by 39 per cent to 36 per cent in a
battle for the chancellorship. If Mr Lafontaine stood, he would lose by 32
per cent to 46 per cent, it said.
Although Mr Lafontaine is far more colourful than the cautious Mr Scharping,
he is also far more controversial, and has never recovered from his
disastrous election campaign in 1990, when he (quite correctly) warned of
the economic problems certain to arise from German unification. At that
time, the German electorate simply did not want to know, and voted for the
optimistic chancellor.

FT  22 JUN 93 / European consumer defies the norm
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is still a long way from producing the homogenous
Euro-consumer, according to a mammoth study into consumer spending and
quality of life conducted across most of the EC's largest markets.
Patterns of consumer spending still vary considerably across Belgium,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain - the countries
that account for 93 per cent of the EC's 340m consumers. The study finds
that the European drinks market is still characterised by national
distinctions. While the average per capita spending on alcohol, soft drinks
and other beverages (such as coffee and tea) consumed in the home was Ecu277
(Pounds 218) in 1992, Belgians spent 2.5 per cent more (Ecu455) than the
Italians or Spanish. The 16-volume report, published by Mintel, discloses a
wide range of similar discrepancies.
The Dutch spend almost 10-times more than the British on health-care

FT  22 JUN 93 / Lombard League shows poll strength
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PARTIAL municipal elections in Italy have confirmed beyond doubt the
strength of the populist Lombard League in northern Italy.
The League achieved its ambition of winning the mayoral race in Milan and
will now be able to use Italy's biggest northern city as a show-piece for
plans to clean up the administration and privatise municipal services.
The second round run-off to elect mayors, held on Sunday, has also
demonstrated the power of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the former
communist party. It managed to act as a rallying point in the centre and
south of the country. The PDS, allying with a shifting series of local
partners that included the Republicans, Greens and Mr Mario Segni's
referendum movement, has done extraordinarily well at the expense of its
traditional rivals, the Christian Democrat party and the socialists.
The new mayors elected for such cities as Turin and Ravenna to Siena,
Catania and Agrigento now have the right to choose 60 per cent of the
municipal councillors. This means that for the first time Italian
municipalities will have stable administrations over the next four-year term
of office.
Also, there will be none of the usual politicking to form administrations
which in the past have taken up to three months or more to organise. The new
rules for municipal elections, which were approved in March, allowed for
direct election of mayors and laid down rules for the allocation of seats
with a majority voting system - with 60 per cent of the seats allocated to
the winning mayoral candidate's party/coalition and 40 per cent to the other
parties on the basis of the first round vote.
Mr Marco Formentini, the 63 year-old mayor of Milan, takes over an
administration that has been run by a special commissioner for the past
months because the corruption scandals have completely undermined the
governing coalition.
Mr Formentini, a lawyer who worked for more than 10 years in the European
Community, easily beat his left-wing rival, Mr Nando dalla Chiesa, gaining
57 per cent of the vote.
Elsewhere the League consolidated its hold on several north towns, including
Novara and three provincial administrations - Gorizia, Mantua and Pavia.
In the first round held on June 6, a broad pattern emerged of the League
gaining a wide margin of support to become the main party in the North; the
PDS took control of the centre in terms of votes; while the Christian
Democrats continued to dominate the South.
Under the new rules, the mayor had to be elected by an overall majority in
towns of more than 15,000.
This led to a second round in 145 towns and cities between the two
candidates who received most votes.
The League always insisted on going it alone; but the system benefited those
candidates who presented themselves as new faces.
Thus, although the Christian Democrats still obtained the most votes
overall, the PDS has acquired more power because its candidates for mayor
have done almost unversally well in the centre and south. The PDS alliance
also won in Turin with their telecommunications professor candidate, Mr
Valentino Castellani.

United Nations peacekeepers are planning the helicopter evacuation of 145
seriously wounded people trapped in Gorazde, the last Moslem enclave in
eastern Bosnia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Serb commanders yesterday
refused to let an emergency relief reach Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area
under Serb siege for 15 months.
Earlier, Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic gave permission for the
passage of the desperately needed food and medical supplies.
It is the first overland convoy to try to reach Gorazde since Serb forces
intensifed their offensive there last month. Some 60,000 people since then
have depended on air-dropped relief supplies that cannot feed the entire
population, most of whom are refugees from the Serb assault on east Bosnia.
Local election officials reported a 96 per cent turn-out in the weekend
referendum on the union of Serb-held territory in Croatia with the
self-styled Serb state in Bosnia. Rebel Serb leaders said they planned to
announce the union of their two areas on June 28, despite a call from Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to postpone the union which would
likely scupper a Serb-Croat truce on dividing Bosnia.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Signs of a split in Bosnian
presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic is coming under pressure, not only from
the European Community but also from other members of the joint Bosnian
presidency to adopt a less hostile attitude to the latest proposals for the
country's political framework.
Arriving in Zagreb last night with Mr Haris Silajdzic, his foreign minister,
the president went straight for talks with the collective Bosnian
presidency, which includes Serbs and Croats as well as Moslems. Earlier in
the evening, the presidency had met in his absence, as signs emerged of a
split which could threaten his position as leader.
The presidency was reported to be trying to decide whether the
Moslem-dominated Bosnian government should join negotiations with Serbs and
Croats on dividing Bosnia along ethnic lines.
Before flying from Copenhagen yesterday, Mr Izetbegovic was ambivalent about
whether he would take part in future Geneva peace negotiations. He spoke of
the need to consult his government and parliament, adding: 'But we shall
never participate in negotiations which are a cover for further territorial
aims of the Serbs.'
Now that the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
have conceded that the original Vance-Owen plan is defunct and that other,
if less desirable, avenues must be pursued, Mr Izetbegovic is seen by a
growing number of western diplomats as the main obstacle to progress. His
political demise would not be felt as a tragedy in western capitals.
After last week's meeting in Geneva of the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro,
Croatia and Bosnia, under the chairmanship of the mediators, separate talks
were held by the mediators with members of Bosnia's collective presidency.
At these talks, Mr Izetbegovic's colleagues adopted a more open attitude
than their leader to proposals for creation of three ethnic mini-states
within a loose confederal framework, which are due to be presented in detail
by Serbia and Croatia in Geneva tomorrow, according to western diplomats.
The extent of the split in the Bosnian presidency was underlined yesterday
by Mr Fikret Abdic, generally regarded as a moderate Moslem and potential
leadership challenger, who said no plans should be rejected outright. He was
quoted by Croatian radio as saying: 'Not one idea of the future arrangements
for Bosnia should be rejected.'
Lord Owen, while still insisting that the Bosnian Serbs must withdraw from
some territory they have occupied, has stressed that the situation on the
ground must be taken into consideration in any peace settlement.
However, he hopes to save some essential elements of the Vance-Owen plan,
such as demilitarisation of Bosnia, creation of a pluralistic democracy
through free elections and the guarantee of human rights. Most EC foreign
ministers have stressed that any peace settlement must be approved by all
the parties involved, and that Bosnia must remain a separate sovereign
state.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Commitment to eastwards expansion
expected - But a divided EC can provide only modest assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the few concrete decisions expected from the Copenhagen summit is for
the EC to commit itself for the first time to Community membership for six
post-Communist states in eastern and central Europe.
Since it will still be many years before these countries - Poland, Hungary,
the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania - have strong enough
economies to survive in the EC, the 12 heads of government are also expected
to agree measures to accelerate political and economic integration with the
Community.
The package is modest when measured against east European needs. But it is
as bold as could politically be expected from the 12, mired in recession and
with some member states hesitant about the enlargement negotiations already
under way with Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway.
The measures include faster access for east European goods to the EC market;
targeting EC aid for infrastructure and industrial restructuring; and the
creation of a 'European Political Area' through joint action in areas of
common interest such as energy, transport, the environment and research, and
structured collaboration on security issues through regular joint meetings.
The European Commission document that heads of government are set to endorse
insists that it is in the EC's interest to commit itself to an enhanced
relationship with the former Soviet satellites if they are to become future
partners rather than unstable neighbours.
'As the scale and the costs of restructuring (the east European economies)
become apparent,' the document argues, 'opposition to change is growing,
with the risk of destabilisation and the reversal of current policies.'
A European Political Area, it says, is 'vital in view of the absence of a
coherent security structure covering the countries of central and eastern
Europe, and the consequent feelings of insecurity in the region.'
Yet the commitment on membership carries no target date for entry. Nor,
despite pressure from the Commission, Germany and the UK, is agreement
likely on a date for a summit between the EC and the east Europeans to
review the latter's progress towards membership.
'There is nervousness about raising expectations' in eastern Europe, one EC
diplomat says. There is also danger that the commitment on membership will
be so grudging as to weaken east Europe's reformers.
France, indeed, was pushing to tighten up the general membership criteria by
making them more explicit. To qualify for the EC, the summit's conclusions
were expected to say, a country should be a stable democracy that guarantees
human and minority rights, with a functioning market economy able to conform
to EC law and withstand the competition of the single market. The candidates
would have to endorse the Maastricht objectives of political and monetary
union. But the Community itself would take into account whether it could
maintain the elan of European integration if it let them in.
This last hurdle emphasises the division in the 12 between 'deepeners' -
federalists who fear enlargement will brake progress towards European union
 -and 'wideners' who hope that by embracing an unprecedented number of new
members the EC will have to become a much looser entity.
This is a battle which should climax in the 1996 constitutional review
foreseen at Maastricht, when reform of EC decision-making and the
streamlining of its institutions will be decided.
By then, the Scandinavians and Austria are supposed to have become members,
and member states such as the UK which favour a wider Europe hope this will
tilt the balance of power against the federalists. Though no dates were in
prospect for the east Europeans, the UK was last night pushing hard for a
firm date for concluding the accession talks with the candidates already in
the EC's ante-room.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Izetbegovic plea for end to arms ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia last night made an urgent appeal to
the European Community to lift the arms embargo against his country.
However, he received no encouragement from the EC's 'troika' of foreign
ministers from Britain, Denmark and Belgium representing the former, present
and next presidency of the Community. Mr Niels Petersen, Danish foreign
minister, said: 'In my view it is not a sound idea to lift the weapons
embargo; it would require a Security Council resolution, which is not
forthcoming, it would lead to more fighting, and there would be great danger
that United Nations forces would have to be withdrawn.'
But it was learned last night that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany may be
preparing to argue in favour of lifting the embargo.
Mr Izetbegovic said: 'We request that the arms embargo be lifted to import a
limited quantity of defensive weapons. The arms embargo deprives Bosnia of
the right to legitimate defence, it has made the aggressor reluctant to
negotiate. Those who argue for the arms embargo want the capitulation of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
The president was ambivalent about whether he would take part in future
Geneva negotiations.
'We cannot decide this here,' he said. 'We must go back to Sarajevo to
consult the government and the parliament.
'But we shall never participate in negotiations which are a cover for
further territorial aims of the Serbs. If the Serbs continue to take over
territory we will not take part in negotiations.'
Mr Petersen said that the final Community response to the deteriorating
situation in Bosnia would have to be taken later by the 12 heads of
government. 'It is premature to say what the European Community will decide
tonight or tomorrow,' he said.
But he added: 'We are fully committed to the principles of the London
conference. But the Community will not pressure the Bosnian government into
any agreement it does not want. We just say it is important to negotiate.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Interest grows in stability pact plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French plan for a new European stability pact, aimed at forestalling any
future conflict over national minorities in eastern and central Europe, is
today expected to receive broad endorsement from Community heads of
government.
It has already drawn a cautiously interested response from other member
governments, and the 12 leaders will today ask their foreign ministers to
examine it in greater detail, and report back in time for the next European
summit in the autumn.
Britain, which might have been expected to be sceptical of launching any new
comprehensive plan for eastern Europe, has decided to give the plan a fair
wind largely no doubt in the interest of fostering the improvement in
Anglo-French relations.
British officials said yesterday the government thought the plan was 'very
interesting', and was 'happy to study it further'. They were wary in case
the French plan should weaken the existing pan-European Helsinki (Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe) process, but thought it contained
'imaginative ideas', worthy of further study, for dealing with serious
problems.
The heart of the plan, launched by Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime
minister, is that the Community should persuade the countries of eastern
Europe to negotiate with their neighbours to resolve the problems of their
minorities, in agreements which would subsequently be endorsed by a plenary
European conference.
The French argue that the break-up of the Soviet empire has revealed the
seriousness of the problem of national minorities in eastern Europe, most
acutely in the case of the ethnic war in former Yugoslavia.
In the latter case the international community proved incapable of
preventing the outbreak of violence. But the French claim that the EC has an
important interest - and may have the influence - to ensure that this
experience is not repeated elsewhere.
The first stage in the plan would be a plenary conference to identify the
problems of minorities and frontiers which needed settling. Stage two would
be a series of negotiations by the relevant sub-groups of countries,
assisted by other European countries as mediators.
Agreements reached in these sub-negotiations would be endorsed formally six
months later, by a second plenary conference of all the participating
governments, and incorporated in a 'European pact'.
The conference would be attended by most of the countries of eastern and
central Europe, as well as by Russia, the US and Canada.
But the French propose to exclude the countries of the Caucasus, on the
grounds that ethnic conflict has already broken out there.
The countries of ex-Yugoslavia would also be excluded for the same reason,
unless in the meantime they should have negotiated an effective peace.
The prime mover in the conference, as well as in the subsequent
negotiations, would be the European Community, since it would be holding out
the underlying incentive for the eastern European governments to engage in
the negotiations, in the shape of ultimate rapprochement with the EC.
The French argue that their plan should be regarded as the Community's first
undertaking in the field of the common foreign and security policy as laid
down in the Maastricht treaty.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Major fires broadside at social
policy - UK premier warns rising labour costs are undermining EC
competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S prime minister, Mr John Major, yesterday sought to move on to the
offensive in his long-running battle with the country's Community partners
over social policy by spelling out the link between Europe's escalating
labour costs and its declining competitiveness.
In a presentation to the Copenhagen summit which was designed to capitalise
on what he sees as a new mood of 'realism' in the Community, Mr Major also
took a further sideswipe at Germany for preventing a European-wide reduction
in interest rates.
Emphasising the advantages that Britain now enjoyed from a combination of
low inflation and low borrowing costs, Mr Major said that high real interest
rates elsewhere were 'penalising growth, stopping investment and damaging
business and consumer confidence'. He also warned against any relaxation of
Maastricht treaty guidelines on fiscal deficits, even though he regarded as
'fanciful' the timetable set for European monetary union.
However, the prime minister reserved the thrust of his speech for a frontal
attack on the damaging impact of high employment costs on competitiveness
and on job-creation.
Contrasting Europe's failure to create jobs during the 1980s with the
success achieved in the US, he told other leaders: 'The choice before us is
a stark one. We surely do not want the 17m unemployed in Europe to become
20m or more people without jobs. We must compete or we shall contract.'
He called for new procedures under which any proposed EC legislation
affecting industry or employment would be accompanied by a full analysis of
its impact on competitiveness. In parallel, the European Commission should
carry out a thorough audit of existing directives to gauge their impact on
business costs and jobs.
In what his aides described as an attempt to dislodge the notion that Europe
could prosper 'through trade with itself', Mr Major offered a litany of
figures to underline the EC's weakening competitiveness and rising
structural unemployment.
The Community share of the industrialised world's exports had fallen by 10
per cent during the 1980s. EC unit wage costs had risen by 4 per cent a year
over the same period. In the US, the rise had been 1 per cent a year. In
Japan there had been no increase. As a result, average labour costs in
manufacturing in the EC were now 20 per cent higher that in Japan or the US.
Offering his prescription, Mr Major called for greater labour market
flexibility and mobility, an end to wage indexation and the promotion of
flexible work patterns and employment contracts.
That provided the basis for a sharp attack on efforts to harmonise social
policy across the Community. With the non-wage costs of European employers
nearly twice the level of their competitors in the US, the priority should
be to reduce the regulatory and social burdens on industry.
Seizing on four directives either passed or under consideration - covering
working time, acquired employment rights, young people and part-time workers
 -Mr Major warned: 'There is a real danger that harmonisation at Community
level is locking us in to costly labour market rigidities and driving away
business to our competitors.'
Backing in principle Mr Jacques Delors' plan to produce a report for the
Brussels summit next December, he said that the main focus should be on
improvements to the functioning of labour markets and lightening the burdens
on industry.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOBBLED by sciatica, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, performed a difficult balancing act at the Copenhagen summit
yesterday.
His exposition on why Europe is losing the race to remain competitive with
the US and Asia contained plenty of food for thought, but little to offend
EC leaders, many of whom have different prescriptions for dealing with
today's unemployment crisis in the Community.
By winning a mandate for further study, Mr Delors has the chance to present
new ideas and a possible action plan in time for the next EC summit in
December.
This may sound modest, but he has learnt to temper his ambition as the
balance of power has shifted from Brussels to the member states.
In his presentation, Mr Delors pointed to graphs showing that the US created
almost 29m jobs between 1970 and 1990, compared to nearly 9m in the EC.
He conceded that Europe's record on youth and long-term unemployment was
worse than that of its principal competitors. Mr Delors called for an
increase in job agencies to help people back to work, suggesting that EC
states increase their annual spending on such agencies from 0.1 per cent of
GDP to 0.5 per cent of GDP.
But he rejected substantial changes either to Europe's labour protection
laws or its welfare state. Mr Delors, a life-long Socialist, was never about
to stage a Pauline conversion on the road to Copenhagen. His goal was more
to shape the debate, now that Europe's political currents have shifted.
The Commission president knows that the highly integrated model he espoused
for the Twelve in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty three years ago is no
longer realistic.
Thus, the eight-point action plan contains something for everybody.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany will be pleased that Mr Delors is talking
about the 'enormous potential for growth' in central and eastern Europe. Mr
John Major, Britain's prime minister, will take comfort that Mr Delors is
preaching the virtue of open markets and is willing to support a 'swift'
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, assuming that difference on agriculture can
be overcome.
Mr Delors offered little to the protectionist lobby in his native France
which is gaining ground as unemployment soars.
Instead, he is looking beyond the present Gatt round to the creation of a
future world trade organisation whose rules would take into account currency
movements, capital flows, environmental codes and the need 'to deliver the
social progress to which everyone has a right. . . . '
Mr Delors also wants to raise spending on research and development, devoting
3 per cent of the gross national product of EC countries to this area,
compared with the present 2 per cent.
He is also calling for a 'common information area' in Europe, to be created
by stimulating industries such as telecommunications, computers, and fibre
optics. He suggested that the first new investment by member states be
Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.9bn), followed by an annual Ecu5bn-Ecu8bn programme.
These ideas confirm that Mr Delors has lost none of his instincts for
thinking and acting on a grand scale. But in Copenhagen yesterday he showed
that he understands that success will depend on the willingness of member
states to co-operate.
Now that he is entering the twilight of his Brussels career, Mr Delors is
looking to preserve today's gains in the EC as much as to chart the future.

MR Michael Heseltine's heart attack yesterday deprived the British
government temporarily of one of its most powerful figures.
Mr Heseltine, who had been on a two-day holiday in Venice with his wife
Anne, was visited by two British doctors in hospital yesterday afternoon.
Having flown back to the UK last night, they were due to return to
re-examine Mr Heseltine at the end of the week.
He was admitted after complaining of chest pains shortly before 3am
yesterday, and was said later to be sitting up and talking, having undergone
medical tests.
His illness is a further blow to the administration, which has been hit by a
string of setbacks. It will weaken its ability to deal with the political
disasters that seem to afflict the government in the weeks before parliament
disperses for the summer.
The trade and industry secretary had been due to finish a set-piece House of
Commons debate tonight on the difficult subject of Tory party funding.
Conservative managers were relying on his oratory to unite the party's
backbenchers. The debate will now be concluded by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, who lacks Mr Heseltine's rallying skills.
The controversy over donations to the Tory party, and in particular those
from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, spilled over to Mr Heseltine's
visit to Venice, where Lord McAlpine, former party treasurer, lives for much
of the year.
'I saw Mr Heseltine in Venice but we did not discuss Asil Nadir. There's no
reason why we should talk about him. We have nothing to discuss about Mr
Nadir,' Lord McAlpine, said last night on his return to London.
Downing Street said Mr John Major had been told about Mr Heseltine's illness
yesterday and had sent flowers and good wishes for a speedy recovery.
In Copenhagen for the European Community summit, the prime minster said: 'I
have sent Michael a message. I hope he will soon be well and will soon be
back at work.'
Westminster colleagues were shocked by the news because Mr Heseltine was
widely known for his resilience and stamina.
Mr Heseltine's official diary has been cleared for the rest of this week,
with his junior ministers sharing extra work. No one expects him to resume
his full duties immediately after that.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the trade minister, is the next most senior minister at
the department and is expected to represent Mr Heseltine at ministerial
meetings for the time being.
Hospital officials in Venice last night said Mr Heseltine, aged 60, was
recovering in a coronary department intensive care unit and that his
condition presented no serious complications.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Major may be ready to accept resignation of Mates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S pointed refusal to offer public backing for Mr Michael Mates
reinforced the impression last night that the prime minister is now ready to
accept the resignation of his embattled Northern Ireland minister.
Mr Major is understood to have talked to Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, about
the 'mood of the party' on the issue of Mr Mates's links with Mr Asil Nadir
and on reports that the Conservatives received funding from companies
associated with the fugitive businessman.
With few Conservative backbenchers prepared to support Mr Mates in public or
in private, the feeling was growing at Westminster that the minister's
future may be settled when the powerful 1922 executive of Tory backbench MPs
meets on Thursday, if it has not been settled before.
Labour will use a full-length Commons debate on Tory finances today to keep
the pressure on by claiming the revelations so far are just the tip of the
iceberg. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said it was not
enough simply to throw Mr Mates to the wolves.
However, associates of the prime minister dismissed suggestions that Mr
Mates had threatened to reveal damaging information about the collapse of Mr
Nadir's Polly Peck empire. Mr Mates - who on several occasions passed to the
attorney-general allegations that the UK security services had conspired
against Mr Nadir - was said to accept now that the charges were without
foundation.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, tried last night to turn the attack
on Labour, saying the real issue on party funding was Labour and the trade
unions. 'We will return any money we have received which is proven to be
stolen,' he said. 'Will Labour promise the same if the tens of thousands of
pounds John Smith admits they received from Robert Maxwell prove to be
stolen?'
However, Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former chief press officer,
urged Mr Major to 'lance the boil' and sack Mr Mates. The Tory party should
also pay back Mr Nadir's donations.
Mr Mates was rebuked by Mr Major earlier this month after he admitted
sending a watch to Mr Nadir bearing the inscription: 'Don't let the buggers
get you down'. That inscription was said to reflect Mr Mates's initial
concern that Mr Nadir's charges had some basis in truth.
Mr Major, at the EC summit in Copenhagen, yesterday again refused to comment
on the rising tide of speculation at Westminster that Mr Mates will soon
quit. Mr Major's silence was seen as a signal that although reluctant to
sack Mr Mates he will not resist his resignation.
He was said to regard as a second 'mistake' Mr Mates's acceptance of the
loan of a car from Mr Nadir's public relations advisers.
Mr Mates did receive a vote of confidence from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, who said his departmental colleague was 'doing
an excellent job' and he 'very much' hoped he would continue to do it.

FT  22 JUN 93 / British Steel condemns state support for European rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR of words over the future of Europe's steel industry intensified
yesterday when British Steel attacked state subsidies for its Spanish and
Italian rivals and urged the European Commission to press ahead with
restructuring plans.
As British Steel reported its worst annual results since its 1988
privatisation - a pre-tax loss of Pounds 149m for the year to April 3 - Mr
Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the balance sheets of many
continental European steelmakers were 'in ruins'.
He singled out the Spanish and Italian industries as 'the worst offenders'
on subsidies and said British Steel and the UK government were both 'utterly
against' further job cuts in the UK.
Mr Moffat's outspoken comments come a year after British Steel closed its
Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland. The company said no large
rationalisations were planned this year.
Mr Moffat warned, however, that if state subsidies continued elsewhere in
Europe, British Steel did not have unlimited funds. 'At the extremity this
could bring about further job losses,' he said.
The loss announced yesterday was expected by analysts. It compares with a
Pounds 55m deficit in 1991-92 and profits of Pounds 733m in 1989-90 when the
steel industry was booming.
British Steel's shares were privatised at 125p, and have traded as low as
54p this year. But they have recently recovered, helped by US buying, and
closed  1/4 p up yesterday at 98 3/4 p.
The company, which has already passed its interim dividend for 1992-93, cut
its final dividend from 1.5p to 1p a share. Mr Moffat warned that
reinstating payouts to more normal levels would require 'a sustained
recovery in profitability'.
He stressed that the key to this was increased prices, which in turn
depended on the EC restructuring plans. British Steel has already raised
prices twice this year and Mr Moffat said: 'We will put up prices again at
the first commercially available opportunity.'
The main plank of the EC restructuring is a partly self-financed scheme
under which companies remaining in the industry would pay rivals to cut
capacity or leave the business. The EC has identified about 30m tonnes of
surplus hot-rolling capacity in the Community.
British Steel supports the plan, but is worried that unless subsidies are
eliminated by the Commission and member states, efficient private sector
producers will be forced to cut capacity further, while weaker but
state-supported enterprises are sustained.
Mr Moffat said the industry's problems could be resolved if significant cuts
in capacity were achieved. British Steel, which had the lowest costs and the
strongest balance sheet among west European steelmakers, was 'in a good
position to benefit from a successful outcome'.

FT  22 JUN 93 / EC leaders differ on how to revive growth and jobs: Delors
mandated to produce action plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders last night drafted a broad strategy for dealing
with the unemployment crisis in the EC, providing a mandate for Mr Jacques
Delors to produce an action plan by the end of the year.
But at a summit in Copenhagen dominated by the worsening economic outlook
and a widespread feeling that high German interest rates are prolonging the
recession, EC leaders could do little to disguise differences on how to
revive European growth and employment.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, called for a fundamental rethink of the
Community's approach to job creation, stressing the need for more
liberalised labour markets, lower social costs for business and tighter
constraints on wage increases.
Warning that Europe's competitiveness had been dangerously eroded, Mr Major
repeated Britain's view that the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty
would amount to a 'job destruction programme'. He told his colleagues: 'Our
total labour costs are too high. Our employment markets are too rigid. And
our labour force is not adaptable and mobile.'
In a performance at the summit designed to demonstrate to his own critics in
the Tory party that Britain can now seize the initiative in Europe, Mr Major
suggested that there was a growing acceptance across the EC that it must
focus on improving its competitiveness with the rest of the world.
Mr Delors, president of the European Commission, conceded that Europe had
fallen far behind the US and Japan in its ability to create jobs. But he
rejected moves to dismantle Europe's social welfare system in favour of a
more deregulated labour market along US lines.
Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark which holds the EC
presidency until the end of the month, said the US model produced 'very
severe defects in the economy', as well as social problems, crime and
hopelessness in large urban areas.
However, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's Socialist prime minister, who narrowly
secured re-election against strong conservative opposition, came out in
favour of deregulation of labour markets.
'The recession is colliding with great rigidity in the labour market; we
have to get greater labour mobility,' he said, calling for more opportunity
for part-time work. Mr Gonzalez's remarks underlined how Europe's jobs
crisis is encouraging fresh thinking, even though EC leaders remain
undecided on how far to go.
'All the leaders see they are in trouble,' said a Dutch diplomat. 'This is
important because it is the start of the debate.'
Although most EC leaders indicated they would give Mr Delors a mandate to
produce a white paper on unemployment by the end of the year, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany argued that the Twelve could not wait until the next
EC summit in December in Brussels. He called on national governments to come
forward with ideas within four to six weeks.
The philosophical nature of the debate was mixed with a desire for
short-term action. The UK, Spain, France and Italy, among others, all called
for a co-ordinated drop in European interest rates - a move diplomats
interpreted as pressure on the Bundesbank to lower market rates.
Mr Delors said the size of the cut was not as important as the timing. 'We
are in a hole,' said an aide. 'A cut in interest rates is urgent.'
During the afternoon session Mr Delors also put forward several new measures
to produce short-term relief for the unemployed.
These include an extra Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) extension to the temporary
lending facility already provided by the European Investment Bank. This
would be in addition to the Ecu5bn agreed at last December's EC summit in
Edinburgh.

Witter, Discover interest
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the Chicago-based group which has been shedding its
financial services interests to concentrate on its core retailing business,
is to spin off the remaining 80 per cent interest in the Dean Witter,
Discover business to existing shareholders.
Sears shareholders will receive about 0.4 shares of Dean Witter, Discover
for each share of Sears they hold. This 'special dividend' will be paid on
June 30 to all shareholders of record on June 28.
Dean Witter, Discover takes in the Dean Witter Reynolds securities firm,
which Sears acquired in 1981, and the Discover bank card business, which
Sears formed in 1985.
The parent company sold off 20 per cent of Dean Witter, Discover's equity to
outside investors, via an initial public offering, in March. The Dean
Witter, Discover shares were floated at Dollars 27, and Sears raised around
Dollars 906m in the process.
At the end of last week, Sears shares closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 53
3/4 , while Dean Witter, Discover lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 34 1/8 .
Other moves in Sears' withdrawal from financial services have included the
sale of its Coldwell Banker Mortgage Corporation and Coldwell Banker
Residential Services units, and the flotation of a 20 per cent interest in
Allstate Insurance Group, the big property-casualty insurer. The Allstate
flotation was the largest initial public offering ever seen in the US, and
Sears raised gross proceeds of Dollars 2.4bn.

FT  21 JUN 93 / People: Former Bass men draughted in to Crown Buckley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crown Buckley, the Welsh brewer based at Pontyclun, Mid Glamorgan, has
appointed three non-executive directors after the completion last week of
its management buy-out from Harp Lager, the Guinness subsidiary.
David Inns, 58, who retired two years ago as financial director of Bass,
will become chairman of the company, which has 80 pubs and clubs in south
Wales.
The other new directors are Jeff Harris, 43, who was managing director until
three years ago of Bass North and is chief executive of Castle Leisure, a
Cardiff-based company which runs bingo clubs, and Andrew Smith.
Smith, 32, is associate director of Prudential Ventures Management, which
was the lead equity investor in the buyout.
Harp Lager had held 75 per cent of the equity since 1990 after Crown Buckley
had had an unfortunate ownership by Barlow Clowes, the company run by the
financier Peter Clowes who was convicted of fraud last year.
The rest of the equity was held mainly by clubs and club members in south
Wales, who voted overwhelmingly in favour of the buy-out which was led by
Mike Salter, managing director of Crown Buckley.
The buy-out, which was celebrated with a barrel of beer brewed for the
occasion, is seen as safeguarding the future of the company's brewery at
Llanelli, Dyfed.
Its best-selling beer is Buckley's Best and last year, the 250th anniversary
of the brewery, a draught beer called the Reverend James was introduced in
honour of its founder.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom of Toronto expects to become a leading supplier of
telephone switches and other telecommunications equipment to China, under a
deal signed with China's State Planning Commission.
The memorandum of understanding covers various manufacturing, research and
training projects, including joint ventures for the development and
manufacture of large-scale circuits and switching systems.
Northern expects the deal to result in sales worth 'billions of dollars'
over the next few years. Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said
that business flowing from the agreement could become the most extensive in
the company's history.
The company also regards the agreement as an effort by the Chinese to
broaden their sources of telecommunications equipment and expertise.
Alcatel of France and Sweden's Ericsson have so far been the main suppliers
to China. AT&amp;T of the US recently signed a similar deal to the Northern
agreement.
A Northern official said yesterday that the agreement demonstrated 'the
Chinese are not only opening their market, but also picking and choosing
their suppliers'.
Northern already has a significant presence in China. It has installed about
1.6m telephone lines, and supplied digital switches to several provinces and
municipalities.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Turmoil casts shadow over oil deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political turmoil in Azerbaijan has made it unclear whether an important
oil deal will go through in the next few weeks as hoped.
The planned deal, still under negotiation, was due to be given a boost
during a visit to London in the first week of July by Mr Abulfaz Elchibey,
the Azerbaijani president, who last week went into hiding. It involves eight
foreign oil companies and is aimed at exploiting an estimated 4bn barrels of
the ex-Soviet republic's oil reserves.
But foreign oil company and government officials say it is unlikely that Mr
Elchibey will proceed with the visit.
Last Friday, Mr Elchibey flew without warning to his home village, and
handed over temporary power to Mr Heydar Aliyev, the parliamentary chairman.
The upheaval has caused many of the foreign oil officials to leave the
country. Some of the remaining officials have voiced concern about the
impact of the political struggle on their attempts to close deals with the
government.
The oil companies are currently in London negotiating with Azerbaijan
officials to develop three Caspian Sea oilfields. The companies are BP,
Statoil of Norway, Amoco Production Company, Pennzoil, McDermott
International of New Orleans, Union Oil of California, Ramco and the Turkish
Petroleum Company.
The companies and the Azerbaijani government were pushing to complete at
least a significant portion of the negotiations before Mr Elchibey arrived.
Oil industry sources said yesterday that although the political confusion
was in danger of stalling the negotiations, Azerbaijan remained badly in
need of foreign investment and it seemed likely that whoever was running the
country would continue the talks.
British Petroleum, one of the parties to the proposed deal, said: 'We remain
in negotiations with SOCAR, the state oil company, and we expect the deal to
go ahead.'
Originally, the companies were divided into three negotiating groups to
develop three of the republic's fields  - Guneshli, Azeri and Chirag.
But last month, the Azerbaijani government decided to put all the companies
into one 'unitised' group, and negotiate with all of them for oil
development.

The top investors are to be a BP-Statoil partnership, covering 36.7 per cent

If they go ahead, these will be the first contracts with foreign companies
signed by the former Soviet republic and are likely to establish the country
as a significant oil producer.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Victory over IRS brings relief to
derivatives players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL victory last week for the Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae), the US government-backed mortgage provider, in a tax case
brought by the Internal Revenue Service, has drawn a sigh of relief from
derivatives users and practitioners in the US.
Companies using derivatives have been growing increasingly nervous about the
tax treatment of gains and losses made on hedges, following the landmark
Arkansas Best decision in the Supreme Court in 1988.
Although the Arkansas Best case did not involve derivatives, it had
significant implications for the use of derivatives for hedging. But the
potential applications of Arkansas Best have only become clear in recent
years, as the IRS has started to take an increasingly aggressive stance on
the use of derivatives.
Part of the problem is there is no specific legislation in the US on the tax
treatment of derivatives transactions used for hedging purposes. The fear
among companies has been that they would be taxed for capital gains on any
profits made from hedges, but would not be able to write off losses.
While the interpretation of the Arkansas Best ruling was that hedging would
be favourably viewed if related to inventory, the definition of inventory
proved elusive.
In February, the US Department of Agriculture was told by the IRS that its
hedging programme for US farmers, which allows them to buy options to ensure
a set price for the sale of commodities, was under scrutiny.
Fannie Mae is not the only institution to have its tax returns challenged;
other large companies, such as General Motors, have also run into problems
over the use of derivatives.
According to experts involved in the case, it involved a use of derivatives
for hedging, which is common practice at Fannie Mae and other companies.
During the period 1983 to 1985, Fannie Mae frequently hedged the funding of
its purchases of mortgage assets in advance, to ensure that the market did
not move against it after a purchase had been agreed but before Fannie Mae
had issued bonds to fund the purchase.
The hedge was achieved either by using the US Treasuries market or the
futures or options markets. This is known as an anticipatory liability
hedge, and is widely used, for slightly different purposes, by many
companies.
Since the future income stream from the mortgage assets would be ordinary
income, the hedge would not work if any gains or losses were treated as
capital gains or losses.
Although the decision in favour of Fannie Mae was widely welcomed by
derivatives professionals, many experts believe there is still a need for
further clarification to end the uncertainty, which they believe is
deterring many US companies from taking advantage of derivative markets to
offset risk.
Many companies have been using the over-the-counter swaps market, rather
than hedging using exchange-traded futures and options, in the hope these
would be more favourably viewed by the IRS, although this matter is also
unclear.
The Arkansas Best Coalition, a lobby group made up of corporate users,
market practitioners and futures exchanges, has been working on draft
legislation, and believes there are openings in the current tax bill.
'The court decided (in favour of Fannie Mae) on fairly narrow grounds,'
limiting the scope for applying the decision to other cases, according to Mr
Bob Mackay, director of the centre for the study of futures and options
markets at Virginia Tech.
However, the fact that the court rejected the IRS argument that short-term
hedges are not allowed under the definition of Arkansas Best is a blow for
the IRS.
According to Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, the US law firm, the case
means that 'Congress won't have to find substantial revenues to pay for
legislation mandating ordinary treatment for hedge gains and losses. Such
legislation also is no longer subject to the accusation of being a
'corporate giveaway'.'

FT  21 JUN 93 / Arms-for-Iraq inquiry recalls witness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH military adviser is to be pressed this week by the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry about the extent to which Saudi Arabia and Jordan were used to
reroute British defence equipment to Iraq in the 1980s.
The inquiry will today and possibly tomorrow take evidence from Lieutenant
Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a member of a
Ministry of Defence working group which vetted defence sales.
Liet Col Glazebrook has been recalled to expand on earlier evidence. On June
11 he said that other members of his ministry and other government
departments had ignored his warnings about the growing export of
defence-related equipment to Iraq.
In evidence to the public hearing of the Scott inquiry last Tuesday Sir
Stephen Egerton, the former UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia, recalled how he
had been called in by a Saudi prince who angrily complained about the way a
contract with the British defence company Allivane had apparently been
delayed.
Sir Stephen said the prince was a partner in Aerotech Saudi, the local
office of Aerotech, the name adopted by Allivane before it went into
liquidation in 1989.
The former ambassador refused to name the prince publicly but passed his
name to Lord Justice Scott.
Contacted at his home at the weekend Sir Stephen said he was still refusing
to name the prince 'for diplomatic reasons', and regretted having given the
name to the judge. He was not prepared to comment on the Allivane contract.
He confirmed, however, that all defence equipment supplied to the Saudi
armed forces was delivered by sea to the Saudi military port of Khudima.
A former director of Allivane who did not want to be named said the company
had negotiated a contract for the supply of 155mm artillery rounds to Saudi
Arabia with Prince Sultan Bin Turki Bin Abdulazziz, a nephew of the present
ruler of Saudi Arabia, King Fahd. The Saudis had complained about the delay
in the contract.
It is thought that the contract was granted an export licence from the
Department of Trade and Industry on the basis that the goods were destined
for Saudi Arabia. The former director said: 'As far as we were concerned the
possibility of the goods going on to Iraq was never discussed. But it is
always possible that the Saudis arranged onward shipment themselves.'
Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury solicitor who has been
seconded as secretary to the Scott inquiry, said that Lord Justice Scott was
not prepared to release the name of the Saudi prince as it did not consider
that to do so served the public interest.
However he added that Lord Justice Scott was continuing his inquiries
regarding Allivane and would decide eventually whether to name the prince in
his report.
'There is no question of keeping the name secret . . . if the judge thinks
it is relevant to publish the name in his report he will . . . he is
independent of government ,' Mr Muttukumaru said.
Classified Whitehall documents which have been examined by the Scott inquiry
show that at a meeting on the February 15 1988 Ministry of Defence officials
were concerned that an Allivane contract with Saudi Arabia, believed to
involve 155mm ammunition shells, may have had Iraq as its ultimate end user.

<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN abandoned plans to distribute food in the backyard of its chief foe
in Mogadishu yesterday, when Pakistani troops supposed to guard it said they
feared coming under sniper fire, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
This would have been the first hand-out to areas controlled by the warlord
General Mohamed Farah Aideed since his militia attacked and killed 24
Pakistanis on June 5, provoking a military showdown with UN troops and an
arrest warrant for himself.
A UN spokesman said distribution was postponed until today because of
'misunderstandings'. Pakistani troops assembled to guard the food drop said
they feared distribution points had not been cleared of snipers.
'I'm responsible for my 20 men,' said Pakistani Captain Zahid Hussain at
Mogadishu port, where 170 tonnes of grain had been assembled to give to the
needy. 'I have to get them home alive, and there are some feeding sites
where adequate security can't be provided because they're surrounded by high
ground. I don't want a repeat of the June 5 incident.'
Gen Aideed disappeared on Thursday when the UN said it wanted to arrest him,
but his gunmen have carried out daily sniping on UN positions.
The UN accuses him of masterminding the ambush and violating a series of
agreements to place his heavy weapons in areas open to inspection, and to
disarm his militia.
US officials said they thought his command centre was wrecked in bombings
and ground attacks last week but that he might still be dangerous while at
large.
'I suspect that he still has the capacity to act. I think it has been
reduced, but he still has the capacity to do more damage,' said one US
official.
Gen Aideed's supporters in southern Mogadishu have tried to whip up feeling
against the UN, the US and Pakistan over the deaths of 80 Somalis in street
protests.
The food hand-out was supposed to refocus the attention of Mogadishu's 1m
people on the relief role which brought the UN to Somalia and to douse
controversy over the killings of civilians by UN peacekeepers.
A small amount of food, guarded by troops from the United Arab Emirates, was
distributed yesterday to areas on the green line between the city and Gen
Aideed's fiefdom and that controlled by his rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
'It's very important that we deliver food to the south. Many of the
displaced haven't received food for 14 days,' said Mr Mark Mullen, field
co-ordinator for UN operations in Somalia.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Korean president attacks Hyundai labour disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korean President Kim Young-sam has criticised labour disputes at
Hyundai, the nation's largest conglomerate, that threatened to derail his
economic recovery programme.
Work slowdowns began last week at Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest car
maker, and several other Hyundai subsidiaries, while a 14-day industrial
action has affected Hyundai Precision, a container and jeep manufacturer.
Mr Kim said he was concerned that Hyundai workers may be 'going too far in
pursuit of their interests,' explaining that 'the wages at Hyundai are high
when compared with other industrial companies.'
However, the president also took a swipe at Hyundai, reflecting his
political feud with its founder, Mr Chung Ju-yung. 'Labour disputes have
occurred almost every year at Hyundai affiliates, so there seem to be
problems with the management's sincerity,' Mr Kim said.
Government officials are worried about the threat of widespread industrial
action at Hyundai for two reasons.
One is that strikes at Hyundai could spread to other industrial groups and
end the government's attempt to curb wage growth this year.
Sharp rises in wages over the past five years, which have averaged 20 per
cent annually, have seriously harmed the country's international
competitiveness.
The prospects for wage moderation initially appeared encouraging. In an
unprecedented accord this spring, the Korea Employers' Federation and the
Korea Federation of Trade Unions agreed to limit wage growth to 4.7-8.9 per
cent this year against 16 per cent in 1992.
This coincided with a dramatic fall in labour disputes during the first five
months of 1993. But industrial action has risen sharply during the first
half of June, breaking the unusual period of labour peace.
The other concern is that disruption of production at Hyundai Motor could
seriously affect the nation's exports just as South Korean industry is
gaining an advantage over Japanese competitors due to the appreciation of
the yen.
Vehicles are one of Korea's leading exports, with Hyundai Motors normally
accounting for two-thirds of vehicle shipments abroad.
The walkouts during two shifts at Hyundai Motor, which began last week, have
shortened production by eight hours and caused losses of 1,600 cars per day
valued at Dollars 15m.
Hyundai Motor workers are demanding a pay rise of 16.45 per cent, rejecting
the company's offer of 5 per cent.
Production at Hyundai Motor was also halted for 10 days last month by a
strike at Apollo Industrial, its exclusive supplier of bumpers.
Partial walkouts have also spread this week to Hyundai Electrical
Engineering, Hyundai Construction Equipment and Hyundai Metal over work
conditions.
The government is examining the legality of the industrial action at
Hyundai.

<TEXT>
AGREEMENT on a final statement from the World Conference on Human Rights,
being held in Vienna, was in jeopardy yesterday after an attempt led by
Islamic countries to have a resolution adopted urging an end to the arms
embargo on the Moslem-led government in Bosnia, AP reports from Vienna.
The move has support from Austria, which borders on former Yugoslavia, and
other countries outside the Islamic group, which has threatened to boycott
the signing of the final document if the resolution is not approved.
Austrian officials are concerned that Bosnia will be remembered as an
international failure to stand up to a bully, much as the world gave in to
Hitler when he took over part of Czechoslovakia before the second world war.
Several western countries, including the US, sympathise with the effort to
help the Bosnians, but officials in their delegations said they feared the
resolution would open 'a Pandora's box' of attempts to pass resolutions for
other causes. This would overwhelm the conference.
Indeed, a resolution is ready which expresses 'deep concern over the
continued policy of Israel of grave violations of human rights against the
Palestinian people'.
A draft obtained by AP calls for Israeli withdrawal from 'occupied
Palestinian territories' and international protection for Palestinians
there.
A UN spokeswoman played down suggestions that the dispute over the Bosnian
resolution could break up the conference. 'The general committee will deal
with this early this week,' Ms Therese Gastaut said.
'At this time this fear doesn't exist.'
But another official described the issue as 'a Damocles sword' hanging over
the conference.
Among the achievements of the drafting committee so far has been agreement
on language reaffirming the universality of human rights, which US and other
officials said stopped a Chinese-led effort that would have watered down
human rights by making them dependent on cultural values.
Conference organisers had hoped that the document would be finished by
Wednesday so it could be approved formally before the conference adjourns on
Friday.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (1): Calmer but not yet
prospering - The worst may be over in the crisis which has swept over the
region's financial institutions in the past two years. But it will be at
least another two years before the banks recover from the loan losses that
plague them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE fearsome storm in the Nordic financial system, which crashed over Norway
at the turn of the decade and went on to engulf Sweden and Finland last
year, has left in its wake a wretched trail of banks with no capital, banks
with crippling burdens of bad loans and banks which have collapsed into the
arms of reluctant but incumbent governments.
The crisis has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, exacerbated the problems
of governments otherwise trying to lessen the state's role in the economy
and, not least, disrupted the smooth operation of financial institutions
just as the Nordic countries are struggling to emerge from what is for some
the deepest recession since the 1930s.
As 1993 progresses, there are signs that the worst may be over: most banks
in the region have shown improved under- lying performance in their first
quarter results and some a reduction in their loan losses; a trend of
falling interest rates and an uptick in economic growth next year has
fuelled a recovery in bank stocks still traded publicly;
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's top bank, has successfully launched a
Dollars 170m share issue to help rebuild its capital base; the first, albeit
tentative, moves towards reprivatisation of nationalised banks have been
made in Sweden and Norway.
But an atmosphere of nervous caution still prevails, with many in the
industry worried that further squalls may yet buffet the banks. Economic
recovery will be fragile, with the banks highly susceptible to any reversal
of the downward trend in interest rates. With unemployment at post-war highs
 -the rate is 17 per cent in Finland - there are worries over increasing
defaults in the personal sector.
Already it is clear that losses will dominate the banking sector again in
1993 and a return to profit in 1994 is far from certain for many of the
region's top banks.
'Uncertainty with regard to developments during the rest of the year must be
considered great,' Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief executive of Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, warned shareholders after
he issued encouraging first quarter figures.
'Lending losses as well as the volume of problem loans remain on a very high
level. Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to draw conclusions
concerning the outcome of the whole year on the basis of the figures for the
first few months. Besides, there is substantial uncertainty about the
general business climate and the economy as a whole.'
It is hard to overstate the scale of the Nordic banking crisis. Of the
region's major banks, only the better-capital- ised Danish banks and
Sweden's Handelsbanken have avoided state aid, although they too have
suffered losses. The insurance sector was also dragged down, with its
problems compounded by the collapse of Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's
Hafnia following their abortive attempt to take over Sweden's Skandia.
The full impact was first felt in Norway, where combined net losses of
NKr16bn in 1991 saw the country's top three banks, Den norske Bank,
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, rescued from insolvency by the state. Den
norske Bank is now 70 per cent state-owned, the other two wholly state-
owned.
Last year, it was the turn of Sweden and Finland. In Swe- den, two of the
top four banks, Gotabanken and Nordbanken, had to be bailed out and taken
over completely by the govern- ment. S-E-Banken was forced to request state
aid, and, at time of writing, is still negotiating a package to ensure that
it does not fall below international capital adequacy levels.
In Finland, every bank has received some state support and two, Skopbank and
the Savings Bank of Finland, have been nationalised.
To date, the authorities in the three countries have together put up more
than Dollars 21bn in capital injections, loans and guarantees to support the
banks and the figure is set to rise signif- icantly. Total write-offs and
problem loans across the region were around Dollars 15bn last year.
The causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In Norway, a slump
in oil prices jolted the system; in Finland, the loss of trade with the
Soviet Union precipitated a huge economic reverse which sucked in the banks;
in Sweden, a spate of property lending in the late 1980s backfired
spectacularly when property prices in Sweden and the UK collapsed.
The common factor, however, was rapid deregulation of credit and foreign
exchange controls in the 1980s. These combined with an economic boom, tax
breaks on borrowing and interest rates typically lagging collateral asset
value growth to lead the banks into what can now clearly be seen to have
been reckless lending on a grand scale.
In the aftermath, it is not surprising that bank managements have reacted by
instituting much tougher credit control policies. Scrutiny of lending has
typically been centralised and tightened through mechanisms such as senior
credit approval committees. 'We have become very conservative,' said a
senior executive at Norway's Christiania Bank. 'It's not so good for our
customers, but we are happier to take the risk of losing a customer than
make a hasty decision.'
However, the real burden of clearing up the mess has been taken on by
governments. Faced with the potential collapse of their banking systems, the
authorities in Sweden, Finland and Norway argued that they had little choice
but to step in to ensure the continued operation of their countries'
payments systems and to reassure international creditors.
This has not only cost lots of taxpayers' money. It has raised difficult
questions about the process of restructuring the banks to position them for
eventual reprivatisation while ensuring competitive neutrality.
The Danish authorities, unlike their neighbours to the north, have held back
from providing blanket deposit guarantees or specific support to their
banks. 'This is deliberate,' says Mr Eigil Molgaard, director general of the
Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. 'It has been done to prevent private
banks from speculating in government support, to avoid competitive
distortions and of course to prevent what are in reality the unlimited
drawings on the government's budget funds which we have seen in the other
countries.'
Certainly, the other countries are now embroiled in an expensive tangle of
support and ownership which will take years to unscramble. In Norway and
Finland, government funds were set up with the initial intention to
restructure what were officially regarded as overbanked systems through
mergers and other rationalisation measures. But these have stumbled. Their
respective governments have for the moment shelved any action while they
await recommendations commissioned from international banking consultants.
In Sweden, the preferred route has been to treat each bank on a case-by-case
basis through the newly-created Bank Support Authority. Stockholm has also
adopted the course, in the case of Gotabanken and Nordbanken, of extracting
their bad assets into so-called 'bad banks' which will remain in state hands
while the laundered parent banks are sold off. One notable consequence of
this is that the state is set to become a large-scale holder of commercial
property, and is likely to remain so for a decade or more.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, accepts that such action by a
market-orientated government is painful, but she says it has been
unavoidable. Aid for the banks, including S-E-Banken, is being constructed
so as not 'unduly to create unfairness' to still independent Handelsbanken,
she says. Nevertheless, Nordbanken's bounce back to profit after being freed
of no less than SKr67bn in bad assets is a hard pill for rival Handelsbanken
to swallow.
But Mrs Wibble says her main concern now is to avoid 'a credit crunch' by
putting a further squeeze on the ailing banks which could damage the
prospects of a return to growth next year after three successive years of
shrinkage in the economy.
As the governments wrestle with the long process of putting their banking
systems back on their feet, there is one remedy none is reaching for:
re-regulation of the financial system. It is universally accepted that it
was not the lifting of controls which caused the crisis, but the way the
banks behaved in a deregulated environment. Besides, re-regulation is not an
option as long as Finland, Norway and Sweden continue to seek membership by
1995 of the European Community, with whose banking regime they will have to
conform.

FT  21 JUN 93 / France's four-letter word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Count on France to rail against Gatt at today's EC summit in Copenhagen. It
will. Yet there is a case, which few in France dare make, for arguing that
nothing could better serve the interests of France, the world's fourth
largest exporter, as well as those of Europe, than a new international trade
agreement.
The French have never incorporated Gatt into their culture, even in a
literal sense. They spit it out as a nasty four-letter word, forever a
foreign acronym of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, itself rarely
translated into French.
Anti-Gatt feeling is at a record high in France. Gloom about rising
unemployment has given way to a sudden panic about delocalisations, or the
shift of production to lower-cost regions. But this has been happening for
years; Thomson Consumer Electronics now employs more than three times as
many people in Asia as it does in France.
Why the panic now? One reason is an alarmist French Senate report on
delocalisations. Another is that the new strength of the French franc and
the continued weight of payroll taxes in France do not help the
competitiveness of French goods. In services, the development of electronic
teletravail, enabling French companies to get their accounting done in
Bombay, also frightens people. Finally, there is the possibility that the
Gatt Uruguay round might soon end in a further lowering of Europe's trade
protection against the rest of the world.
Many French fear Gatt is about to gobble them up. Mr Philippe Seguin, the
Gaullist president of the National Assembly, last week put the fear
graphically. 'Gatt is the picket tying down the European lamb and making it
prey to the voracity of ever more ferocious world competition.' The fear he
raises is that Europe's unemployment is not the result of a general,
cyclical, world crisis, but of a more permanent crisis, confined to Europe,
because of the way free trade operates against it.
So, up has gone the old French battle cry of 'Community preference'. To
some, including the Senate, this means raising EC tariffs all round; to the
others it means graduated tariffs  - relatively low for the EC's immediate
eastern European and north African neighbours, higher for the rest of the
world, and punitive for countries with industries that employ children.
'Community preference' certainly exists in EC agriculture; its variable
levies always bring the price of food imported into the Community up to that
produced domestically. But the EC was lucky to get away with this in the
early days of Gatt, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's government
ac-knowledges that it is unrepeatable in the industrial field. It is
largely, they concede, a warm-sounding phrase that sounds nice to French
ears, but does not constitute a realistic battle plan for the Uruguay round.
What, then, is their battle plan? One suggestion is to limit the benefits of
Gatt trade liberalisation to countries subscribing to International Labour
Organisation conventions on free trade unions and the like. The idea is
presumably that unions would push up labour standards, and thus costs, in
developing countries. But common social provisions are hard enough (as UK
Prime Minister John Major has shown) to negotiate among the EC 12, let along
among the Gatt 111.
The Balladur government really believes its line that the EC has the world's
most open trade system. To the fact that, at the start of the Uruguay round,
the EC had an average trade-weighted tariff of 5.7 per cent, America 4.6 per
cent and Japan 3.5 per cent, it retorts that America has far more high
tariff peaks on textiles, shoes and glass, and that Japan's barriers are all
non-tariff ones, but still prohibitive. True enough. In any case, Paris
complains, any margin of average EC tariffs above others is negated by
monetary swings in general, and the dollar's undervaluation in particular.
True again. But part of the problem lies in Europe's own monetary system,
and there is no hope of adding 'a monetary Gatt' to a trade one.
Another idea circulating in Mr Balladur's office is for temporary EC
'tariff-quotas' (imposing high tariffs when import quotas are exceeded).
Brussels has done this on steel from east European countries, which did not
complain to the Gatt because they want to join the EC one day. There is no
reason why other countries should be so forebearing.
By contrast, the French call for Europe to have the same weapons of
commercial defence as America strikes a sympathetic chord with many EC
partners. Nothing annoys Washington's partners more than its tendency to
play the Lone Ranger with the world trading system, using the 'silver
bullet' of Section 301 of its successive Trade Acts.
But the EC already has a 'European 301'  - in the form of its 1984 'new
Community instrument', allowing the EC to take unilateral measures against
what it sees as unfair trade practices  - but has hardly ever used it. Most
of France's EC partners have generally only allowed it to be used against
non-Gatt members, of which there are precious few left.
Even its use would hardly rein in the US Congress, the real culprit and
conceiver of Section 301. Only a Gatt deal, leading to a World Trade
Organisation with some real clout, might give Capitol Hill pause. In
contrast to arrangements in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
(reflecting America's dominance in 1944), the European Community's role in a
WTO would reflect the fact it now accounts for the largest share (20 per
cent) of world trade. Over time, too, a WTO might acquire a monetary and
social dimension.

FT  21 JUN 93 / When in doubt, buy dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Such logic surely
justifies the dollar's surge against all other leading currencies on Friday.
Investors may be sceptical about President Bill Clinton's leadership
abilities and doubtful that the US recovery will ever take off properly. But
compared with any other region, the US is undeniably a haven of prosperity
and political stability.
The collapse of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government has thrown Japan into an
extended period of political and economic turmoil. On Friday, as Wall Street
analysts debated the implications - including the alarming possibility that
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party might lose its grip on power for the
first time in over three decades - the dollar staged an electrifying rally
against the yen, closing nearly 3 per cent up at Y109.4. In Washington the
momentous events in Tokyo made the Clinton administration's obsession with
trade barriers look suddenly petty.
The dollar was also remarkably strong against European currencies, closing
at a 15-month high against the D-Mark of DM1.68 and pushing sterling below
Dollars 1.50 for the first time in several months. In part this reflects a
gloomy reassessment of European prospects: Wall Street is waking up to the
fact that Germany's economic difficulties are far more profound than
previously assumed. Bonn needs to take tough action not just to curb its
budget deficit but also to reduce the share in national income of heavy
manufacturing, which remains excessive by the standards of most
service-oriented modern economies. Yet many US observers doubt that Germany
possesses the political will to make hard choices.
Such doubts extend from Germany to the whole of Europe, which many American
economists believe is suffering from another attack of 'Euroscelerosis'.
Just as the corrosive effects on jobs and confidence of 'corporate
restructuring' delayed and weakened the US's cyclical recovery in 1991 and
1992, so it is expected to hold back Europe this year and next. The
difference is that labour market 'rigidities', a euphemism for strong unions
and generous unemployment benefits, suggest the adjustment process will be
more troublesome in most European countries. In the short run, cuts in
public spending and a threatened scaling back of the cherished welfare state
can only undermine confidence further, with adverse consequences for private
spending and investment.
The strength of any dollar rebound, of course, will also depend on trends in
the US. The negligible increases in consumer and wholesale prices reported
for May have eased fears of an imminent tightening of monetary policy. But
the Federal Reserve continues to watch inflationary trends with some
trepidation.
The dilemma for policymakers is that wages and prices seem to be rising
somewhat faster than economic models suggest they should, given unused
industrial capacity and a relatively slack labour market. The Fed doubtless
hopes that the acceleration in inflation earlier this year will turn out to
be an aberration. But its reported policy shift to a bias towards raising
rates suggests that it is readying itself for the possibility that
historical economic relationships have broken down.
At present short-term US rates are either zero in real terms or slightly
negative. Since the seeds of most inflations are sown earlier than people
appreciate, this leaves the Fed feeling vulnerable, even though monetary
growth is extremely subdued. After all, some great economists, such as the
Swedish theorist, Knut Wicksell, argued that it is inherently inflationary
to hold interest rates below their natural equilibrium levels. On a
Wicksellian analysis, the Fed ought gradually to raise short- term rates to
at least 4.0-4.5 per cent, regardless of what is happening to unemployment
or the monetary aggregates.
If the ghost of Wicksell guides Fed policy over the next year and if the
German downturn proves as protracted as some American analysts fear, the
dollar could rise sharply against the D-Mark. Economic weakness may force
the Bundesbank to cut short-term rates by as much as three percentage
points; in that case the differential between German and US short-term rates
could narrow from some 4.5 percentage points today to zero this time next
year. And at that stage the outlook for European growth might still look
worse than that in the US, suggesting further dollar appreciation.
The potential for a dollar rebound against the yen is more constrained.
Indeed, if the Clinton administration could control markets it would be
zero: it regards yen appreciation as an essential tool for eliminating the
'principal asymmetry' in the global economy - Japan's Dollars 130bn current
account surplus.
Yet it is not so unnatural for a rich economy to be a capital exporter at a
time of domestic recession. The rapidity of the yen's dizzying climb this
year could not be justified by economic fundamentals. By adding to the
strain on Japanese companies, it threatened to deepen the domestic downturn
and, perversely, to increase the current account surplus that so upsets
Washington. If political turmoil in Tokyo prompts a more rational assessment
of the relative merits of investment in Japan and the US, the dollar is
likely to regain more ground against the yen.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Cowboy in tune with the music - Maurice
Oberstein, chairman of the British Phonographic Industry, talks to Michael
Skapinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the cameras recorded a parliamentary committee's denunciation of UK
compact disc prices last month, a 64-year-old in an ankle-length coat and
fur-trimmed cowboy hat picked his way through the television cables at the
back of the room.
The UK music industry was under attack, and Maurice Oberstein - the New
York-born, Queens Park Rangers-supporting, cricket-loving chairman of the
British Phonographic Industry - was there to put the case for the defence.
'Unsubstantiated tommy-rot, lies and deceit,' was his response to the
national heritage committee's assertion that the large record companies and
retailers were overcharging CD buyers. During the parliamentary hearings
last April, his constant interruption of Gerald Kaufman, the committee's
chairman, added to Oberstein's reputation as the most eccentric figure in an
industry not short of non-comformists.
In the music business, opinion about Oberstein is divided. Some believe his
antics and extensive collection of hats make good copy and television
pictures, ensuring that the industry's voice is heard. Others think
Oberstein makes them look ridiculous.
The conflict mirrors the music industry's divide between the irascible,
creative types who find and promote new acts, and the corporate lawyers and
accountants who populate the boardrooms. What confuses many about Oberstein
is that he is a lawyer whose behaviour makes many of the creative types look
like models of propriety.
In his office at the Berkeley Square headquarters of music group PolyGram,
where he is executive vice-president, Oberstein dons a blue cap for the FT's
camera. His brightly coloured waistcoat is decorated with horses - another
passion. Eric, his English setter, sleeps on the floor beside him.
When the picture-taking is over, however, the cap comes off, the clowning
stops, and he puts on as fluent and shrewd a performance as can be found in
the industry.
Oberstein, unlike many of his colleagues, does not resent the way the music
business has been singled out for attack. The announcement last month that
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the music industry
is, Oberstein says, a recognition of its importance.
'We're in a star-studded business where our artists make the news - if they
get married, if they get divorced. We now find everything about our industry
is newsworthy,' Oberstein says.
So the criticism is a compliment? 'It is. An MMC inquiry would have been
unthinkable a number of years ago because it would have been a minor affair.
Today we're recognised as a major business.'
The MMC's focus will be the copyright act's restrictions on parallel
imports, enabling music companies to prevent others from bringing their
products into the UK. Music lovers will suffer if the restrictions are
loosened, Oberstein argues. Music companies will concentrate on the
best-selling albums and abandon more specialised recordings.
'If you have a free flood of imports, the independent record dealer won't be
able to compete with W H Smith and co. Who will be able to import? Only the
biggest, who have the cash to buy in quantity. The independent dealer in
your neighbourhood will disappear.'
The independent record shops are used by the music companies to push their
new acts and promote young talent. 'W H Smith and Woolworth do not stock our
new, developing artists - and it's not their job to. They're high street
general merchants,' Oberstein says. The disappearance of independent dealers
would lead to a sharp reduction in musical diversity, he says. This has
already happened in the US where there are far fewer independent outlets.
'This is not a doomsday scenario that I'm making up. This has happened in
every place dominated by the mass-marketeer. We, at PolyGram, have over
18,000 titles with which we service the UK record dealers. Our United States
company, for a market five times as big, has 10,000.'
British music companies need their profits, Oberstein adds, to ensure they
maintain their level of creative output. Although the UK music market
represents only 8 per cent of the world total, about a quarter of recordings
sold worldwide have some UK content - whether it is the performer, producer
or some other contributor.
But with nominations for the industry's Brit awards this year going to
veteran performers, such as Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Elton John, how
much new talent are the UK companies finding?
Oberstein defends ageing musicians. There are veteran performers in other
creative industries, such as film. 'Nobody leapt up from their chair at the
Oscars and said: 'My God, Clint Eastwood's been around for 10,000 years,
look at that wrinkled man,' ' he says. 'I see nothing wrong in our artists
having longevity. The population that we, the record business, are selling
to is an older population. We're losing teenagers as a proportion of the
population worldwide.'
He concedes, however, that the past decade has been a relatively barren
musical period. It has to do with the relationship between singers and
songwriters, which has undergone several changes since he went to work for
his father's independent record label in the 1940s, which he later sold and
joined CBS.
When he arrived in the UK to work for CBS in 1965, Oberstein says, he found
that most British performers were singing tunes already made famous by
Americans. American artists turned out music written for them by
songwriters.
'Then the Beatles came along and changed the world, in that you had an
extension into the major rock music business of the singer-songwriter. We
always had it with folk artists, we always had it with Woody Guthrie. We
always had it with people who were protesting in one way or another.
'But we never really had the artist-writer-performer. We had major artists,
like Frank Sinatra, but they were singing other people's songs. The Beatles
unleashed - fortunately, in Britain - that whole culture of
performer-writer. We had the Rolling Stones - they wrote. We had The Who.'
The performer who could not write songs began to disappear. Artists who
recorded songs written by someone else were ridiculed in the music press.
The songwriters who couldn't sing began to be ignored. But not all singers
could write to the Beatles' standards and by the end of the 1970s, far less
new music was appearing. Oberstein says the industry has to regain the knack
of bringing together performers who cannot write and writers who cannot
perform.
But is there any future selling music to an ageing population? There might
be fewer teenagers in the developed world, but they are the customers of the
future. Does it not worry the industry that teenagers are devoting more of
their time and money to computer games and other leisure pursuits, and less
to music?
'I suspect that, when radio came along, people said: 'Oh my God, now the
record industry is going to disappear because people are going to listen to
radio.'
'But we shouldn't take for granted that music will survive. We have to work
at it. We have no monopoly on the home entertainment dollar. But there's no
reason why we shouldn't get our share.
'When all the kids on Thursday, Friday, Saturday are at raves, at dances,
they aren't dancing to a video game, or a video of Terminator II or watching
Lennox Lewis on pay TV. We ain't going away.'
For one thing, Oberstein insists, music will always play its part in the
romantic life of the young. 'You don't make love in the back seat of a Ford
with a video game in the background.'

<TEXT>
AFTER an extraordinary day of trading in currency markets on Friday, dealers
will now look for indications that the dollar can push further ahead against
the D-Mark and the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz.
On Friday, the dollar convincingly broke through the critical DM1.67 level
against the D-Mark, which some technical analysts have seen as the last
milestone before DM1.80 is reached.
The dollar's rise is mainly due to expectations that Germany will cut short
term interest rates soon. And, because of this, the M3 figures for money
supply growth, due out today or tomorrow, are important.
The M3 figure will indicate whether money supply is falling within the
Bundesbank's target range. If it does, the Bundesbank may ease its repo rate
on Wednesday for the first time in six weeks - and this will further reduce
the premium on holding D-Marks as opposed to dollars.
On the dollar side of the equation, Wednesday's durable goods figures for
May will show whether the US economy has recovered any further. A second
revision of the poor first quarter GDP figure is also due on the same day.
On Friday, the Japanese yen fell by around 3 per cent against the dollar
following the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government. Japanese
political developments will be watched closely, as dealers wait for any
reversal in the yen's prospects. The yen may be underpinned by the huge
Japanese trade surplus, despite the shock of Friday's fall.
The D-Mark's strength in Europe will be tested this week if more European
governments cut interest rates. There is strong speculation that the Bank of
France could cut its intervention rate today, following the Franc's strong
performance last week.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling's bumper year still shows
promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS certainly been a bumper year so far for the Eurosterling bond market.
New issuance for the first half of 1993 reached Pounds 15.6bn, exceeding the
total new supply in the Eurosterling market for the whole of 1992, according
to figures from Euromoney, with no sign of the steady flow of dealsabating.
Not surprisingly, the Eurosterling sector suffered a severe setback in the
second half of 1992 as the pound took a pummelling, culminating in its
ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September.
That the tide has clearly turned is due to a combination of factors,
including strong demand - both domestic and overseas - for relatively
high-yielding paper, and attractive swap opportunities for the issuers of
fixed-rate sterling paper.
Investors have been keen to lap up the new Eurosterling issuance for several
reasons. In the case of overseas investors, one of the main attractions in
recent months has been the belief that sterling would appreciate against the
D-Mark, although with over DM2.5 to the pound now, some of the European
investors may become more cautious about prospects for further currency
gains.
Leaving aside the currency aspect, however, underlying conditions for the
bond market are still regarded as attractive. Recent news on the inflation
front has been good, and the market is being encouraged by 'noises from the
government that it will try to get expenditure under control,' in the words
of one dealer.
There remains the question of when the next interest rate cut will take
place. Last week's announcement of a further surprise drop in unemployment
in May quickly dispelled hopes of an imminent base rate cut, leading to the
underperformance of the short end of the yield curve. Realistically, the
question of a base rate cut may not resurface until either the Bundesbank
eases, or the economic recovery in the UK appears to be delayed again.
For the time being investors appear content with the relatively high yields
on offer in the Eurosterling market. 'Yields are very attractive compared
with other European paper at the long end,' says one UK house.
UK institutions are particularly interested in buying the long end of the
market because of the yield, especially pension funds which want 10-year or
longer-dated paper. There is also a healthy appetite from retail investors
in this maturity range. Dealers point out that Channel Island accounts and
high net worth individuals have been enthusiastic buyers of the
higher-yielding corporate bonds and building society subordinated paper.
'With inflation still at only 1.3 per cent and gilt yields of 8 per cent to
8.5 per cent, investors are getting outstanding value from Eurosterling
paper,' says one UK house.
Furthermore, investors have been spoilt for choice with an interesting range
of credits - and hence yield spreads. In June, the market has been tapped by
names ranging from Bank of Greece (which is rated BAA1/BBB-) and Forte
(rated A-/BAA1) to those top-notch borrowers Unilever and Marks and Spencer.
Bank of Greece launched its Pounds 100m 10-year deal at a yield spread of
175 basis points over the gilt. As one dealer put it, 'given that the gilt
yield is 7.9 per cent, that's an enormous pick-up in percentage terms - in
other words, 20 per cent of the yield is spread'.
At the other extreme, and appealing to investors who were after quality,
Unilever and Marks and Spencer Finance both launched 15-year deals, at
spreads of 23 basis points and 25 basis points respectively.
One of the key factors behind the surge in Eurosterling issuance from the
borrowers' point of view is the attractive swap opportunities. One dealer
estimates that between 60-70 per cent of the deals launched have been
swap-driven, mainly from fixed-rate sterling into floating rate sterling,
although there have been opportunities to swap into other currencies as
well.
'It (swaps) has driven the volume in five-year sterling, and to a lesser
extent at the 10-year area,' says one dealer, pointing out that the deals
from M&amp;S and Unilever were swap-driven. Opportunities in areas such as the
dollar sector and D-Mark have been less favourable recently, and the main
opportunities, on and off, have been in Canadian dollars, French francs, and
sterling.
Most of the houses specialising in Eurosterling expect to see the steady
supply of paper continue, noting strong interest in the seven to 15-year
area.
'We're seeing corporates increasingly interested in doing something and
watching with varying degrees of readiness. Some are fine-tuning while
others are only thinking about getting themselves ready,' according to one
of the main Eurosterling houses. Borrowers' main concern is to lock into
fixed-rate sterling at the right moment - when interest rates are at a low.
For the top names, it is cheaper to borrow long term in the bond market than
to turn to the banks for syndicated or bilateral credits, especially since
banks are often unwilling to arrange loans with maturities of over five to
seven years. Added to which, borrowers appear keen to diversify their
sources of funding, veering away from bank lending.
'If you are a triple A credit it is cheaper to raise money in the
international capital markets, but if you are a lesser credit, it may make
more sense to use bank loans,' points out one dealer.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Mediterranean Bonds: Fundamental factors fuel a rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE MEDITERRANEAN bond markets
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy, Spain and Portugal - are once again in favour. Many analysts are
confident the second wave of convergence will be more sustained than the
first, which crashed a year ago when the Danes voted against ratifying the
Maastricht treaty, shattering expectations of European monetary union.
But the latest rally in the Mediterranean bond markets is founded on
economic fundamentals.
'In an environment where intra-European currency risks have already been
reduced by floats, realignments and successful defences of the existing
parities, lower German interest rates can only contribute towards further
bond yield convergence,' according to analysts at SG Warburg. The process is
well under way, with 10-year yields between Mediterranean markets and
Germany at their lowest point since the first half of 1992.
This time, the rally is supported by the negative outlook for the D-Mark.
'The risk of the D-Mark turning round and rallying is much less this time,'
according to Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities.
The French yield curve is now below the German yield curve as far out as
five years, which has 'given heart to the Mediterranean markets,' says Mr
Major.
Dealers report large flows into the Spanish market, with many investors
switching out of D-Mark assets. Flows into Italian bonds have been much
smaller, but are expected to increase, while Portugal offers interesting
opportunities.
The result of the first Maastricht vote in Denmark was not the only factor
to restrain Spanish and Italian bond markets. Both have suffered
difficulties of their own, though in Spain confidence is returning.
Assembling a Socialist-led coalition government in Spain is well advanced,
liberating the market from political uncertainty.
The 10-year yield margin between Spain and Germany has dropped from 527
basis points at the start of the year to around 350 basis points. In
absolute terms, 10-year Spanish bond yields have dropped 200 basis points,
and five-year yields have performed better, falling 280 basis points.
Italy's recovery has been less dramatic. The spread between 10-year Italian
and German bond yields has narrowed from 627 basis points at the start of
the year to 500 basis points, but with gross yields at 11.79 per cent, they
still appear to have some way to go.
The country's severe debt overhang, and the uncertain political outlook
before elections in the autumn, means there is still a brake on Italian
bonds.
But the lira's devaluation has served the market well, and there is growing
confidence the currency is stabilising.
The much smaller and less developed Portuguese market has been left behind,
but interest in it could grow, as the government establishes benchmark
issues across the yield curve.
The government is shortly to launch the first 10-year issue of domestic
bonds. Analysts say the government plans to issue around Es400bn this year.
Nevertheless, the market still suffers from a lack of liquidity. and there
are fears the Escudo may have further to fall. Despite this, with short-term
interest rates 160 basis points higher than in Spain, the market appears to
offer prospects for healthy returns as the economy plunges into recession.

FT  21 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Investors climb yield curve on recovery talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of long-dated securities jumped as the possibilities of a cut in base
rates receded further and hopes rose that the UK might be in for a period of
non-inflationary growth.
Yields for long-dated gilts fell by about 15 basis points during the week,
while those for bonds at the short-maturing end of the yield curve rose
slightly.
The switching by investors up the yield curve was sparked by indications
that the UK economy may be steadily expanding, without too much evidence of
rising prices.
In this environment there seems little likelihood Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new
chancellor, will choose soon to cut base rates from 6 per cent.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers,
said: 'All the signs are that we are seeing a happy medium of growth that is
not too strong to lead to inflationary pressures, though not so weak that
the budget deficit will worsen.'
In the past month the yield difference between 10-year German and UK
government bonds has fallen by about 30 basis points on the better inflation
outlook for the UK and the worrying signs in Germany about economic decline,
coupled with high deficits and upward pressures on prices.
On Friday, after a modest spurt in gilt prices, yields of 10-year UK bonds
were quoted at around 7.7 per cent at the close.
However, a reminder that the UK faces its own problems with a likely Pounds
50bn deficit this financial year will come with the next gilt auction a week
on Wednesday. Probably about Pounds 3bn of stock will be auctioned, in the
seven to 10-year maturity range. The amount of stock and the details of the
bonds will be announced tomorrow.
Several of the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers, meeting today
for the first time since February, are concerned the deficit must be tackled
to increase the chances of a sustainable recovery.
While Professor Tim Congdon and Mr Gavyn Davies are opting for further tax
rises to add to those already due to take effect from next April, Mr Andrew
Sentance and Prof Patrick Minford are keener on public spending cuts to
bring down the deficit to manageable levels by about 1997.
Both Mr Davies and Prof Minford would like to see base rate cuts over the
next few months to help the recovery, ideally with a programme of fiscal
tightening.
The broad consensus among the Treasury advisers - whose report to Mr Clarke
is due to be presented next week - is that government borrowing as a
proportion of gross domestic product should be brought down to about 3 per
cent by this year from the current level of about 8 per cent.
Signs that a modest recovery is under way were strengthened by the news that
seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 26,100 to 2.914m between April and
May, against expectations in much of the gilts investment community of a
rise. The fourth monthly fall in unemployment cut the seasonally adjusted
jobless rate to 10.4 per cent last month from 10.5 per cent in April.
Less welcome for gilt investors was that the public sector borrowing
requirement grew to Pounds 5.01bn from Pounds 4.71bn in April and Pounds
3.13bn in May last year. The deficit increased to Pounds 9.7bn in the first
two months of the current financial year from Pounds 6.6bn in the same
period of 1992-1993, reflecting rapid growth in state cash outlays and low
increases in tax income.
There was some cheer for the gilt market with the year-on-year increase in
the retail prices index last month turning out at 1.3 per cent, the same as
in April and the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964. The RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments, the Treasury's targeted measure of underlying
inflation, rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May after a 2.9 per cent rise in
April. Retail price inflation excluding food fell to a 33-year low last
month.
However, inflation at the retail level has almost certainly reached its
lowest point in the current cycle, with increases likely over the next few
months as the effects of last year's cuts in mortgage interest rates drop
out of the RPI calculations.
Some commentators have argued that the emphasis on the RPI in calculating
inflation is hardly sensible, bearing in mind that the numbers are so bound
up with what was happening a year previously.
This may give more urgency to the Bank of England's efforts to come up with
new inflation indicators more linked to current conditions and which could
prove useful as the possibility of price pressures increases in the later
stages of any sustained recovery.

FT  21 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Politics provides focus as inflation
genie is stoppered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE inflation genie back in its bottle, at least temporarily, the
attention of the US credit markets this week is likely to focus more on
political developments, both in the US and Japan.
President Clinton's budget cutting package, approved by the Senate's finance
committee on Friday, is due to come before the full Senate on Wednesday in a
debate being billed as one of the most partisan Democrat/Republican clashes
in years.
In Tokyo, there may be further financial fall-out from Friday's sudden
dissolving of parliament and calling of snap elections next month - a
development which sent the yen sharply lower against the dollar on Friday.
Both developments could prove positive for the US credit markets. Political
instability in Japan, coupled with a dollar rising against European
currencies as well as the yen, could increase the attractions of US
Treasuries for international investors. Greater political certainty in
Washington would also help the market.
Admittedly, Wall Street has factored into its calculations the strong
probability that a much-amended deficit reduction package will pass through
the Senate, go on next month to a conference between the Senate and House of
Representatives to iron out differences between their two bills, and finally
be signed into law by President Clinton.
However, actual clearance of the measure through the Senate, after a debate
limited to 20 hours, should provide considerable underpinning to the bond
market, since its post presidential election rally has been predicated
partly on firm action to cut the deficit.
True, the bill under discussion in the Senate is a much watered down version
of Mr Clinton's initial proposals. But the new package should still reduce
the federal government's borrowing requirement, while the new taxes it
imposes will tend to dampen growth and reinforce the belief that inflation,
which grew at a 4.3 per cent annual rate in the first four months of this
year, can be contained at a little over 3 per cent for the whole of 1993.
That belief gained credibility last week when the consumer price index
statistics for May showed a rise of just 0.1 per cent overall.
The market was not entirely surprised, since May's producer price index,
released the previous Friday, had shown a similar slowdown from the sharp
inflationary trends of the previous four months.
Still, the consumer figures erased any lingering fears the Federal Reserve
might be forced in the near future to tighten monetary policy for the first
time in four years.
However, the positive effect of this news on the long end of the market was
quickly erased, and the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue ended on Friday
night with its yield unchanged on the week, at 6.80 per cent.
An unsettling factor on Friday was comments by the two fiercest
anti-inflation hawks among the Fed's governors, Mr Lawrence Lindsey and Mr
Wayne Angell, who issued warnings that inflation remained too high for their
tastes. Mr Lindsey said he planned to increase his inflation estimate to an
annualised rate of 4 per cent.
Still, the market can take comfort from the fact that the Fed has
demonstrated an anti-inflation vigilance over the past few weeks by adopting
a bias towards monetary tightening, should the need arise.
But with the US outlook for growth remaining moderate and deficit
legislation looking likely, some analysts are suggesting that long bond
yields could test their recent 6.65 per cent lows over the coming weeks.
Some are even beginning to wonder whether the Fed's tightening bias could be
removed later in the year if the deficit reduction package duly becomes law
and appears to be endangering the recovery.

<TEXT>
MR Guido Savignone, chair-man of the Banco di Sicilia, the leading financial
institution on the island, has resigned following sharp criticism of the
management by the Italian treasury.
The treasury's attack on the failure of the bank's management to improve
results after a shake-up two years ago represents a significant toughening
in the authorities' attitudes towards the operations of those financial
institutions in which the state has stakes.
The treasury has a 14 per cent share in Banco di Sicilia, the remainder
being held by a foundation controlled by the island's regional government.
The bank is understood to have just balanced its books in 1992 but in 1993
the institution risks running a loss. Some L3,000bn (Dollars 2bn) of bad
loans are reported. The bank is undergoing an inspection by the Bank of
Italy. Until this is completed, its demands to increase its capital are
unlikely to be met.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIKE, the US sports footwear manufacturer, expects to report earnings in the
year ending May 1994 significantly below Wall Street expectations, due to
weakness in European economies and a sluggish US retail sector.
The news, issued after the New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, sent
Nike's shares plunging by some Dollars 4 7/8 in late, off-exchange trading,
to around Dollars 62.
The shares had ended the regular session up around Dollars  1/8 at Dollars
67.
The company said Wall Street analysts had been expecting it to make around
Dollars 5.50 a share.
Its announcement followed bad news from Reebok International, one of Nike's
leading rivals, which said last week it expected to report second quarter
earnings of 44 cents to 48 cents, compared with analysts' expectations of 56
to 60 cents.
Factors behind Reebok's warning included a lack of a product in the key
basketball area and European weakness.
Mr Philip Knight, chairman of Nike, said the European economic problems,
combined with a stronger US dollar, had made the company cut its
international growth expectations for the year.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: NedCar turns in loss of Fl 243m
for the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NETHERLANDS Car (NedCar), the Dutch carmaker owned jointly by Mitsubishi
Motors of Japan, Volvo of Sweden and the Dutch government, suffered a net
loss of Fl 243.6m (Dollars 133.9m) last year, its third year of rising
losses.
Last year's financial performance, burdened by restructuring costs of Fl
117m, was a further sharp deterioration from a net loss of Fl 74.1m in 1991
and Fl 76.1m in 1990.
NedCar was formed in 1991 when Mitsubishi Motors acquired a one third equity
stake in Volvo Car BV, which had been controlled 70/30 by Dutch state
interests and Volvo respectively.
The company, which makes the Volvo 400 series, was hit last year by the
continuing weakness of demand in its main markets and by significant
currency losses after the European exchange rate fluctuations last autumn.
Car production rose last year to 94,019 from 84,507 in 1991, but output
remained well below the break-even level of more than 100,000 cars a year.
Turnover rose to Fl 1.98bn from Fl 1.74bn in 1991.
Further losses are expected this year. Production is running at 430 a day,
or 95,000 a year, but has already been hit by more than two weeks of
down-days, and more short-time working is expected in the second half of the
year.
The NedCar workforce fell to 6,109 people at the end of 1992 from 6,521 a
year earlier and is expected to fall sharply to around 4,500 by the end of
1993.
Mitsubishi and Volvo are investing around Fl 3bn in NedCar for the
development of a new range of cars to be launched in 1995-1996 and the
doubling of capacity to 200,000 cars.
The training of several hundred NedCar employees at Mitsubishi's Mizushima
plant in Japan will begin later this year.

bookworms / A look at an annual report which is more than justpackaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL reports may occasionally contain surprises, but few have contents
which leap out of the page at the reader like the latest offering from
BSO/Origin, the Dutch computer services company.
Those bored with the 1992 financial figures can make themselves a cup of
tea, cover their wounds or decorate a parcel with the help of the document.
The 130-page report, bound like a hardback book, includes a sticking plaster
from the US, a glistening star-shaped ribbon from India and a teabag from
England.
The objects are part of a thick section containing multi-lingual diaries and
photographs of BSO employees from around the world on October 27 last year -
a date chosen at random.
Mr Eckart Wintzen, president and chief executive, said: 'We think annual
reports are never read. People flick through them and ignore all the company
blurb as fluff.
'This may be fluff but it is fluff of a higher quality.'
Past editions of the annual report include one written on the company by an
anthropologist, and one designed for children aged 12, which had to be
reprinted to meet demand for about 35,000 copies.
As well as the financial information for the year to December 31, the report
also contains a detailed environmental statement which attempts to measure
the company's impact and how much it has spent to mitigate these effects.
The report is printed on chlorine-free paper.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Coup chalked up by Nordquote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NORDIC stock exchanges are expecting to strengthen their position in the
highly competitive European securities markets with a trade-supporting
information system, dubbed Nordquote.
The Nordic exchanges - in Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm - have
stolen a march on the rest of Europe, where attempts to agree European-wide
systems, such as Euroquote, have come to nothing.
The Nordic decision is essentially defensive. By creating a single market
for Nordic securities - initially only for blue-chip equities - the Nordics
hope to win back business which has gone to London's Seaq International,
where a substantial part of the trade in leading Nordic stocks is done.
Taken singly, Mr Bent Mebus, managing director of the Copenhagen Stock
Exchange, said the four small Nordic markets tend to be regarded as too
small and exotic, but brought together, the joint market should prove more
attractive.
However, the Nordics do not see Nordquote as an alternative to any European
system of the Euroquote type.
While the Nordics maintain that progress towards European stock exchange
co-operation has been so slow it is not expedient to await a European
solution, they see their move as a contribution to the formation of a
European stock exchange structure.
Nordquote has also to be seen in the light of the EC's Investment Services
Directive, which will come into force in 1996 and give brokers in any EC
country access to the markets of any other member country.
The system, when it opens on April 1 next year, will quote only about 20 of
the stocks in which there is a significant international interest. The list
will gradually be increased to around 100 stocks, and other securities, such
as bonds and derivatives, may be introduced.
For the international investor, the system means he or she need only
approach one broker in any of the Nordic countries to trade in the stocks
listed on Nordquote.
This is expected to make the Nordic market more attractive, not least by
increasing market liquidity. Nordquote will be open only for Nordic brokers
and will be an interactive system enabling brokers, through their national
stock exchange, to indicate bid and offer prices in selected securities.
Trading will take place on the telephone and as long as the system remains
an information exchange, not an actual trading system, the rules and
regulations applied by each of the four countries will not have to be
modified.
Trading will be in accordance with the rules of the country where the
security is listed, and the national settlement procedures will apply.
There is a considerable degree of co-operation between Nordic bourses,
including an electronic network. This will be adapted for Nordquote, with
each stock exchange responsible for development and maintenance of its own
part of the system. Each exchange will meet the expenses of developing and
operating the system. It is estimated setting up Nordquote will cost DKr3m
(Dollars 484,000), or DKr750,000 per exchange.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: China signs accord on HK
listings

<TEXT>
OFFICIALS from China and Hong Kong signed a milestone agreement in Beijing
at the weekend, designed to facilitate cross-border regulatory co-operation
on securities. The memorandum prepares the way for the listing of mainland
companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Mr Liu Hongru, vice-chairman of the Securities Committee of China's State
Council, or cabinet, said on Saturday that at least two and possibly three
Chinese companies would be listed in Hong Kong before the end of June.
The process marks China's first big foray into international securities
markets and is being viewed as a serious test of the credibility of mainland
reporting and accounting standards.
Mr Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, said in
Beijing after the signing that the agreement was aimed at providing
'investors with better protection'. It was also designed to 'ensure the fair
and efficient operation of the securities markets'.
The provisions include those laying down guidelines for the sharing of
information about listed companies and reporting. The agreement helps to
create a legal framework for listings in Hong Kong.
State Council last year approved the listing of nine leading mainland
companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange. These include Tsingtao Brewery
and Shanghai Petrochemical which are expected to be among the first two
Chinese companies to list.
Among signatories to the memorandum signed in Beijing at the weekend were
China's Securities Regulatory Commission and the country's two fledgling
stock markets - the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Shenzen Securities
Exchange. Signatories from the Hong Kong side were the Securities and
Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Mr Liu made clear the planned listing of nine mainland companies in Hong
Kong was part of a trial process, and there would now be a lull while the
move was assessed.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Thorn EMI set for Pounds 150m
lighting sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI is expected to demonstrate further concentration on its music and
rentals business today when it announces the sale of Thorn Lighting division
for about Pounds 150m.
The purchaser is believed to be Investcorp, the Bahrain financed
international investment bank which controls well-known businesses in the US
and Europe.
Thorn has been looking to refocus the group on its music and music
publishing business worldwide and the international rentals business and to
dispose of most of what the Thorn EMI name is historically linked.
The sale of the lighting division will surprise some observers, however, who
had thought Thorn was closer to selling its defence arm, possibly to GEC.
Thorn Lighting has recovered well despite the recession, raising operating
profits in the year to March to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 12.6m). But given the
division's exposure to the continental European market, the sale will be
seen as a good deal for Thorn.
'If the deal does indeed go through, it looks as though the price is good,'
said Mr Bruce Jones, analyst at Smith New Court. 'The deal accords very much
with Thorn's strategy.'
As Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has developed that strategy of focusing on
the music and rentals businesses, the City has increasingly speculated about
a demerger once the defence and other non-core businesses are sold.
There is no logical reason why music and rentals should be under the same
roof. Smith New Court says that even with a conservative valuation of the
the rentals business, the value of the sum of the parts should be greater
than the combined Thorn EMI.
Disposal of Thorn Lighting would follow the sale in April of it stake in
Thames Television to Pearson, owners of the Financial Times for Pounds 57m
and the sale of its fire extinguisher business to Williams Holdings in March
for Pounds 41m.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Engineering dealmakers return to
the market - Next month's flotation of Quadramatic and the plans for its
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the most active dealmakers in the UK engineering sector during the
last decade are bringing another company to the stock market.
Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley are part of a team which is floating
Quadramatic, a coin-handling and optical group with a market value of about
Pounds 45m. The intention is to expand the quoted vehicle by acquiring
high-margin engineering companies with good international opportunities.
Both men had a roller-coaster ride during the eighties with FKI, the
electrical engineering group which expanded rapidly by turning round
loss-making companies. However, the Pounds 415m acquisition of Babcock
International a few weeks before the 1987 crash proved a deal too far, and
the groups were demerged two years later.
Mr Whalley is still chairman of FKI, which is responding to a refocusing
strategy, and is both deputy chairman and acting chief executive at Babcock
International, the engineering contractor which is also involved in
substantial reorganisation. Mr Gartland has since 1991 been concentrating on
the venture capital business set up with Mr Whalley in 1989.
This business, Gartland and Whalley Securities, brought together the group
which is to be floated. Quadramatic comprises Coin Controls International,
Oldham-based maker of coin-handling equipment, and Combined Optical
Industries a Slough company moulding plastic optical products.
Gartland and Whalley Securities, supported by banks, bought Coin in March
for Pounds 20m cash, so no time has been lost in coming to the market.
Combined Optical was purchased in 1990 for Pounds 929,000 from Pilkington,
the glass group.
Mr Gartland, chairman of Quadramatic, said the group was being floated
speedily because it wanted to pay off bankers and take advantage of the
current opportunities to buy companies.
He said: 'Most public companies are still coming out of recession, so their
main priority is to rebuild their damaged balance sheets, rather than make
acquisitions.'
He was 'not planning an FKI, Mark 2' - partly because he believed there were
now far fewer bad managements sitting on good companies. 'Instead, we intend
to buy good businesses that we believe should be exceptional businesses.'
Mr Richard Williams, chief executive of Quadramatic, has been managing
director of Coin since 1991. He recalls joining a good company that was
profitable, but sleepy: 'The first time I sat in on a quality assessment
meeting, I found there was no-one there from manufacturing]'
Mr Mike Bell, appointed Coin's manufacturing director, has reorganised
production on a cell basis, and the 370 employees have responded to the
challenge of being directly involved in improving production methods,
delivery times and stock control.
The company supplies coin-handling and validation equipment to makers of
leisure and gaming equipment, vending machines and telecommunication and
transport organisations. It also has a manufacturing plant in Chicago and
makes 68 per cent of sales outside the UK, supplying both mechanical
mechanisms and the latest electronic units, which use micro-chip technology
to validate coins.
Coin's equipment can be set to accept currencies from all over the world,
and the group's library has thousands of specimens from 120 countries. In
spite of the strong overseas exposure, Mr Gartland believes there is still
considerable scope for expansion, since the group makes no sales to either
Japan or Korea, which together account for about 25-30 per cent of the world
market.
Coin's electronic validation machinery is in demand for potentially
high-fraud locations, such as motorway service stations in the UK or close
to international borders, where people try to use the wrong currency. 'We
love it: the more they try to defraud, the higher the specification
becomes', Mr Williams said.
The company has sharply cut lead times and takes prides in responding
quickly to the market. Customers can prove fickle; one asked it to quieten
the pay-out mechanism of pub gaming machines, then quickly sought the change
to be reversed after punters reacted badly to not having noisy confirmation
of their jackpots.
From making operating profits of Pounds 1.78m on turnover of Pounds 15m in
1991, Coin this year expects Pounds 4m on sales of Pounds 19m-Pounds 20m.
This means it enjoys profit margins well above the industry average - a
feature Mr Gartmore wants to be common to all Quadramatic companies.
The chairman hopes that further improvements can be extracted from Combined
Optical, which makes hand-held magnifiers for Boots, and other products
featuring plastic lenses, visors and windows.
Comnbined Optical was making a small loss on sales of Pounds 4.8m when
acquired in 1990, but in the year to March made operating profits of nearly
Pounds 600,000 on turnover of Pounds 6m.
Mr Bob Roote, managing director, said his company's expertise in casting
plastic on to steel moulds, without distortion, allowed it to charge premium
prices. A competitor's full-face visor costs only Pounds 1.30 but distorts
vision. For a distortion-free visor, Combined Optical can charge Pounds 4 -
much more, but still a marginal part of the cost of a firefighter's
protection outfit.
A significant element of Quadramatic's expansion strategy is the excess
space at Coin's Oldham factory, one of the many converted cotton mills in
the area. After the reorganisation of production, Mr Bell believes the
present factory could easily treble level output.
Mr Gartland said this spare capacity would make acquisitions extremely
attractive, as extra output could be obtained for relatively modest levels
of capital expenditure.
Quadramatic's pathfinder prospectus should be published in the next two
weeks, with the flotation in July. A placing and financial intermediaries
offer will raise Pounds 20m of new money, of which Pounds 5m will be open to
retail investors, and leave the company ungeared.
Mr Gartland will ask the market to fund future acquisitions, which would
have to be earnings-enhancing 'within a very short period'. He believes
Quadramatic's management could handle a much bigger business and would like
to expand at 20 per cent per annum - half organically and half by
acquisitions.

FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Clarke Nickolls cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clarke Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property investment and trading company, saw
its pre-tax losses fall from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds 47,000 in the 1992
year. The figures were helped by an exceptional credit of Pounds 79,000
against a charge of Pounds 948,000 for the fall in property values.
The accounts were produced on a going concern basis pending the resolution
of talks with Banque Indosuez over loans to an offshoot.
A tax credit left a net profit of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 661,000 losses) but
there was a further provision of Pounds 642,000 (Pounds 6.83m) against
losses on withdrawal from property development.
Earnings per share were 0.71p (losses 3.2p).

FT  21 JUN 93 / Sun in shadow attracts the bulldog's gaze: A UK insurer with
fresh reason to tackle its problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In mid-1989, stock market enthusiasts were calling Sun Alliance the world's
greatest insurance company.
Record pre-tax profits of Pounds 372.4m in 1988  - on premium income of
Pounds 2.25bn  - and enviable financial strength made the company the star
of the UK insurance industry. Its solvency ratio  - the yardstick which
compares net assets to premium income  - climbed to 124 per cent by the end
of 1989, comfortably ahead of its rivals.
But three years on, the advantage has been lost.
Losses of some Pounds 500m on domestic mortgage indemnity policies and falls
in the value of its property and equity investments have cut its capital
base by nearly 50 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
And, camped on its doorstep, is Mr Donald Gordon, the South African who
gradually squeezed his way to control of Sun Life and now calls his 3 per
cent stake in Sun Alliance a 'strategic investment in embryo'.
Mr Gordon said earlier this month that Transatlantic Holdings, his South
African and French-controlled financial services group, would take a 'closer
interest' in the affairs of Sun Alliance.
'The image that comes to mind is of a bulldog. These guys won't go away,'
says Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets. 'If I was
Sun Alliance, I'd feel nervous now,' says a merchant banker.
The situation presents a challenge to a management which has been accused of
over-confidence. In the 1980s conservatism served Sun Alliance well. It
avoided the kind of risky foreign ventures that ensnared Guardian Royal
Exchange in Italy and General Accident in Australasia. It eschewed the
trendy thinking about distribution which led both Royal and the Prudential
to buy loss-making chains of estate agents.
Instead the company focused on building up its share of the UK market for
home, life and motor insurance products. Its decision to invest heavily in
the domestic equity and property markets led to strong growth in its asset
base, as share prices and property values soared.
However market conditions changed at the turn of the decade and the strategy
quickly began to unravel.
The company's share of the home insurance market and its investment
orientation left it heavily exposed to two years of bad weather losses and
the rigours of the UK recession.
Worst of all, as the housing market slumped the company recorded
underwriting losses of hundreds of millions of pounds on domestic mortgage
indemnity policies, which insure mortgage lenders against the losses they
make on the sales of repossessed properties.
By the end of 1992, Sun Alliance's solvency margin had fallen to 54 per cent
 - much nearer the industry average. Mr Stephen Bird, an analyst with Smith
New Court, says: 'Sun Alliance was different and superior to other
composites. Now they are just one of the pack.'
Critics suggest that the company had not properly assessed the risks to
which it was exposed. One former manager says the group was 'obsessed' with
its building society connections, which generated high volume sales of home
insurance, while a decision in the mid-1980s not to buy reinsurance
reflected 'over-confidence. They thought the sun would never set.'
'They have coolly let go of Pounds 1.5bn by not managing the concentration
of risk on their balance sheet,' says another analyst.
While the downturn in the UK insurance industry led many of the group's
financially weaker competitors to introduce changes relatively rapidly, Sun
Alliance's financial strength shielded the company from these pressures and
delayed the pace of change.
It now insists that the problems are being addressed. Mr Arthur Hayes, who
co-ordinates global strategy and asset management, says the losses from
mortgage indemnity were an 'enormous blow', but that over the past 18 months
the group's problems 'have been tackled with a great deal of vigour'.
He points to the rise within the organisation of younger managers, such as
Mr Jim Rochelle, managing director of the group's UK non-life subsidiary,
and to a 14 per cent cut in staff numbers as evidence of a new mood.
The pace of change could heat up now that Sir Christopher Benson, the
property man and chairman of Boots, has taken the chair. Sir Christopher is
widely expected, for example, to urge a more open strategy for public
relations.
There are signs, too, that Sun Alliance is beginning to tackle its
dependency on the UK market. The acquisition of Denmark's Hafnia earlier
this year has helped strengthen the group's position in continental Europe,
which now generates about 23 per cent of its premiums.
However, Sun Alliance still attracts some harsh criticism. 'My lasting
impression is of a very top heavy management with a very old fashioned
style. They seem to have preserved a lot of features that other companies
have got rid of,' says one management consultant who recently worked with
the company. 'The feeling you have with the company is that it doesn't know
where it is going.'
This may be an extreme view, but critics question a number of features
within the group. 'There are pockets of excellence, but much of the business
is mediocre,' says one analyst. Problem areas include the quality of the
group's motor business, especially the portfolio of third party policies.
Other observers suggest Sun Alliance has been slower than some of its rivals
to exploit the trend towards direct telephone sales of motor policies.
'There are important changes in the way business is being done. We don't
think Sun Alliance is addressing these issues,' says Mr David Hudson,
analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'I wouldn't have thought at this stage
that they were more strongly focused than any other composite insurance
company.'
It seems the City has still to be convinced that the issues are being
addressed quickly enough.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: The Brash lesson on central bank
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton made a valedictory plea last week. Giving his last
Mansion House speech as governor of the Bank of England, he urged the great
and good in British society to find a way of reconciling greater autonomy
for the bank with accountability to parliament.
Just a couple of days later, Mr Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand, was telling some of the same great and good at a meeting of
the European Policy Forum in London how they solve the dilemma down under.
Both men are determined inflation fighters who, at present, are operating
monetary policies in countries with low inflation. But Mr Leigh-Pemberton
has made no secret of his belief that an independent Bank of England would
be better able to combat inflation than one that takes orders from the
Treasury.
The problem in Britain has always been finding a way of reconciling a more
autonomous central bank with parliamentary accountability on matters of
monetary policy. The German Bundesbank model of an independent central bank
is not transferable to the UK because of the accountability problem.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's call for 'politicians, academics and the City' to
consider ways out of the dilemma was inspired in part by signs of greater
flexibility in Downing Street. Responding to Mr Norman Lamont's resignation
speech, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said there was 'a genuine case'
for an independent central bank. He indicated that he would regard the idea
more favourably 'were a way to be found to get the benefits of an
independent central bank without the loss of parliamentary accountability.'
It is here that Mr Brash's address to the European Policy Forum last week on
New Zealand's experience with central bank independence is relevant to the
UK. New Zealand has a Westminster style parliament. It also seems to have
found a way of making its monetary policy accountable to parliament while
still giving its central bank sufficient independence to pursue price
stability.
At the heart of the New Zealand model is a contract between the government
and its central bank. The government, as Mr Brash explained, is barred from
instructing the Reserve Bank on how to operate monetary policy to achieve
and maintain price stability. 'In this sense, the bank is truly independent
of the government,' he said.
But the bank's governing legislation explicitly acknowledges that government
has a role in monetary policy. The government defines the bank's goal of
price stability in a policy targets agreement (PTA) with the governor. It
also has the right to change the objective of monetary policy as set out in
the Reserve Bank act.
The present PTA, signed by Mr Brash and Ms Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand
finance minister, declares that 12-month increases of 0 to 2 per cent in the
consumer prices index are consistent with price stability. It allows that
the index might move out of the target range because of particular shocks
such as higher consumer taxes, natural disasters or big changes in import or
export prices. But in that case, the bank has to detail its estimate of the
impact on prices and the inflation target.
The government can also change the objective of monetary policy by invoking
an override provision. But this must be handled in a 'formal and public'
manner. If the override provision conflicts with the PTA, a new agreement
must be negotiated and presented to parliament.
To Europeans used to the Bundesbank model, the override seems a singular
weakness in the New Zealand approach. But Mr Brash considers that any
government attempting to use the override for short-term political aims,
such as giving a boost to the economy ahead of an election, would be likely
to cause a huge political row and greatly damage New Zealand's standing in
international bond markets. He is probably right in doubting whether any
government would invoke it.
The New Zealand model is also noteworthy for what Mr Brash calls its 'robust
and transparent accountability mechanisms'. The fact that the bank's
'primary function' is to achieve price stability makes it simple to decide
whether it is meeting its obligations. The PTA, by defining price stability
as 0 to 2 per cent CPI inflation, makes judgment on this score even easier.
Because Mr Brash's name is on the PTA, he can be held accountable if the
bank fails to meet its stability target and in extremis dismissed by the
finance minister. His performance is also monitored by a board of directors.
At least every six months, the bank must publish and put before parliament a
monetary policy statement. Mr Brash is frequently cross examined on this
statement by parliament's finance and expenditure select committee.
In Mr Brash's view, New Zealand's experience shows that it is possible to
have an independent central bank that is politically accountable under a
Westminster-style government.
But, although a senior representative of the UK Treasury was making copious
notes as Mr Brash spoke last Thursday, it would be premature to expect the
UK to rush to follow New Zealand's example.
Central bank independence in New Zealand was launched under the favourable
star of genuine bi-partisan political support. That could not be guaranteed
in the UK.
Moreover, the New Zealand model has yet to be tested in conditions other
than those of disinflation and recovery from deep recession.
Then there is the Maastricht Treaty. Because it gives the government
overriding powers, the New Zealand model is incompatible with the Maastricht
rules on central bank independence.
On the other hand, Mr Frank Vibart, the director of the European policy
forum, points out that in some respects, such as accountability, the New
Zealand model appears superior to the plans for an independent European
central bank system under the Maastricht Treaty.
He believes the UK should adopt the New Zealand approach for the Bank of
England, while seeking to persuade the rest of the EC to incorporate its
better features into the Maastricht blueprint.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Mr Li rebuffed in Hong Kong bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LI Ka-shing and his mainland Chinese partner, Citic Pacific, were dealt a
rare rebuff over the weekend when Henderson Investment emerged as the owner
of 35 per cent of Miramar Hotel and Investment, currently under offer by Mr
Li's Cheung Kong and Citic.
Henderson, controlled by rival Hong Kong property tycoon Mr Lee Shau-kee,
paid HKDollars 17 a share and HKDollars 10 a warrant for 34.8 per cent of
Miramar's shares and 34.5 per cent of its warrants. Both prices were 50
cents higher than the revised offer Mr Li and Citic made for the hotels and
property group late last week.
Cheung Kong and Citic immediately raised their offer to the level at which
Henderson had dealt, valuing Miramar at HKDollars 9.63bn (Pounds 1.32bn).
But the emergence of Henderson in the Miramar contest betrays a
miscalculation on the part of Mr Li, generally regarded as one of Hong
Kong's most astute property tycoons. Contested takeovers in Hong Kong are
rare. Usually controlling shareholders of companies under potential offer
are squared off first, making the bid a formality.
None of the parties are talking to the media, but it appears from public
statements by Miramar's now former controlling shareholders that Mr Li and
Citic's Mr Larry Yung failed to woo the board in time-honoured fashion. Last
week Miramar denounced the bid as 'unfriendly' and claimed the company was
worth HKDollars 20 a share.
However, the stage appears set for some quintessential Hong Kong horse
trading as Henderson's Mr Lee has indicated at the weekend he had no plans
to make a full offer. His minority stake would enable him to make a deal
with Mr Li and Citic or prevent them from exercising control over Miramar's
assets.
These include the 500-room Miramar Hotel in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon's main
tourist district, as well as 900,000 sq ft of office space in the same area.
Both are viewed as being under-exploited by their former owners.
Property analysts in Hong Kong regard both properties as ripe for
redevelopment. With Citic's mainland Chinese connections, analysts believe
if Mr Li and Citic were to succeed in the bid, they could finance a large
part of the offer by selling office space to mainland interests.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Guidance round the insider minefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING UK stockbroking firm has warned that if listed companies retreat
into their shells because of recent insider trading scares, they could risk
'an ill-informed market from which no-one benefits'.
A report by Hoare Govett Corporate Finance says that companies should
monitor market expectations. If there are material changes in trading, they
should consider making a formal Stock Exchange statement.
Fears that companies will clam up have followed the public censure of London
International Group by the Stock Exchange and the separate conviction of the
analyst Mr Thorold Mackie of insider trading offences following a private
meeting with a company. In May LIG told 13 analysts and four institutions
that profits forecasts for the company were too high.
Last week NFC, the transport group, said it might drop its 'best view'
forecasts of future profits because of concern about methods of
communicating information to shareholders.
Hoare's report was written to provide companies with guidance on how to
maintain contacts with the market within the present rules.
It says companies should make more use of the formal opportunities provided
by results announcements and annual meetings to set out their views on
current trading. 'This will provide a backdrop against which subsequent
informal communication with market participants can take place.'
It also advocates that where there is concern about a company's financial
position, it should consider releasing a balance sheet and a cash-flow
statement at the interim stage. This information could then be discussed
more freely.
The City tradition of year-end company briefings with analysts is 'unlikely
to be satisfactory in the new disclosure environment,' says Hoare. It points
out that companies could make formal trading statements either before the
closed season or after an important sales period, such as Christmas for
retailers.
Companies should develop a clear understanding of price-sensitive issues and
monitor market expectations carefully, Hoare says. If the need arises for
market perceptions to be changed, a public announcement should be made
promptly.

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FERRUZZI family surrendered financial and managerial control of its
troubled agro-industrial and chemicals empire over the weekend, paving the
way for a radical shake-up of the group.
The latest twist in the saga came as Milan magistrates announced they were
opening a file on the Ferruzzi debacle. The move appeared primarily intended
to protect minority shareholders following the revelation two weeks ago that
the group had consolidated debts of L31,000bn (Dollars 21bn).
The new management of both Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the family's
financial holding company, and Montedison, the main industrial company, is
to be chaired by Mr Guido Rossi, a company law expert and former head of
Consob, the Milan stock exchange watchdog.
The chief executive will be Mr Enrico Bondi, who comes from Gilardini,
Fiat's aerospace/defence group, but who has spent many years in the
chemicals industry including a period with Montedison.
Mr Rossi appears to be the choice of Mr Enrico Cuccia, the head of
Mediobanca which is organising the rescue through a pool of the five main
creditor banks. Both Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the chairman, and Mr Carlo Sama,
the current chief executive, will be relegated to honorary roles.
On Friday the Ferruzzi family agreed to pledge its entire holding of 560m
shares in Ferfin to the consortium of five banks. This stake has been
pledged to cover outstanding Ferfin debts of L15,123bn.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Pace of recovery in housing market slows in past weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recovery in the UK housing market has slowed considerably since the
beginning of May, sales figures from 15 of the country's largest house
builders show.
The figures, compiled by Housebuilders Federation, show that net
reservations  - sales on which deposits have been paid, less cancellations
 -rose by about 10 per cent during the first two weeks of this month
compared with the corresponding weeks last year. Weekly sales in spring were
running more than 35 per cent higher than last year.
At one stage during a four-week period at the end of March and the beginning
of April, net reservations were as much as 50 per cent higher than last
year.
Builders say it is foolish to judge the state of the market on just a few
weeks' sales figures and add that poor weather this month may have dissuaded
some people from visiting show homes.
Nonetheless there is concern that some of the steam has gone out of the
housing market revival. The rate of increase had begun to slide even before
June.
A slowdown in the housing market would provide further evidence of the
fragility of consumer confidence in a weak economic recovery. Retail sales,
according to government statistics, fell slightly in May.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, told a housing market conference
organised by Nat West Securities last week that house sales traditionally
slowed after the Easter holiday, but it seemed likely that recovery from now
would be gradual.
The Housebuilders Federation figures showed net reservations by house
builders up by almost 30 per cent during the first 5 1/2 months of this
year, in spite of the recent slowdown.
Estate agents have also expressed concern that sales may be slowing. A
survey of more than 100 English and Welsh estate agents published last week
by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that recovery was
being threatened by potential sellers delaying putting homes on the market
in the hope that prices would rise.

FT  21 JUN 93 / EC urged to act on jobs crisis: Summit faces calls for lower
interest rates and tough Asian trade policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC LEADERS open a two-day summit today under growing pressure to deal with
the unemployment crisis in the Community, including calls by participants
for a co-ordinated reduction in European interest rates and a tougher trade
policy toward Asia.
Spain and France are leading the pressure for new steps to stem the growing
tide of unemployed, expected to top 18m this year. But the Danish presidency
of the EC  - supported by the UK and Germany  - is holding firm against
protectionist measures which supporters say will safeguard jobs in Europe.
Trade is likely to be the most divisive issue at the Copenhagen summit,
which will also endorse proposals to integrate six former communist
countries in eastern and central Europe into the EC. EC leaders will also
discuss how to salvage something from the collapse of the international
peace initiative in Bosnia.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, declared that the summit
would mark a 'turning point', now that ratification of the Maastricht treaty
was complete in Denmark and drawing closer in the UK. He was speaking after
a Socialist leaders' meeting called for a co-ordinated reduction in European
interest rates, warning that the Community risked a social explosion without
fresh measures to promote growth. The Danish prime minister offered little
prospect that EC leaders would reach any agreement beyond a general
exhortation on the need for greater economic policy co-ordination and public
investment. On the call for lower interest rates, he cautioned about
possible negative reaction from the markets and opposition from the German
Bundesbank.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night endorsed calls for lower
European interest rates but emphasised that Britain did not have high
borrowing costs.
In a clear reference to the effect of German rates on those countries whose
currencies remain in the European exchange rate mechanism, he said: 'That
Europe as a whole would benefit from lower interest rates I think is beyond
doubt, but that is a matter which must be discussed among those who find
themselves locked together.'
In his presentation today, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is
expected to reject a retreat from the European welfare state. An aide said:
'He will focus not on whether to keep the European system of social
protection, but how.'
Mr Major is expected to attack what he perceives as unnecessary employment
costs, such as the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. EC diplomats
predicted friction if Mr Major pushed his case for greater deregulation too
hard, or if he sounded a triumphalist note now that the EC is reconsidering
social policies it supported in the more upbeat economic period before the
signing of the Maastricht treaty.
Along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Major is also likely to
oppose calls from France for limited protectionism and urge leaders to renew
efforts to reach a Gatt Uruguay Round agreement by the end of the year.

FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The time has come for Eurotunnel to break the impasse bedevilling its
relationship with its builders. The disagreement over Pounds 1.4bn of cost
over-runs has already besmirched the reputations of both parties. It is now
in danger of inflicting real financial damage too. Eurotunnel's
shareholders, who are unlikely to receive a dividend until the next century
anyway, will be severely disadvantaged if the tunnel's opening is delayed
further. With huge debts to be serviced, Eurotunnel's bankers cannot remain
disinterested.
Despite the heated rhetoric, the difference between the two parties may not
be great. At one stage, Eurotunnel was prepared to pay Pounds 1.2bn in paper
and cash. The outstanding disputed sum may be less than the revenues lost
because of delays in opening. Eurotunnel would be unlikely to recoup the
difference through separate litigation for damages from the contractors for
late opening. It has already reduced its projected revenues for 1994 by
Pounds 244m. That may yet prove too optimistic.
An agreement would benefit both parties. Eurotunnel could achieve a phased
opening of services and obtain operating licences faster than currently
predicted. The 10 contractors, some of which are strapped for cash, would
receive their money earlier. This week, Eurotunnel's shareholders can air
their views at the annual general meeting. Some seem prepared to challenge
their board's stance questioning whether the game is worth the candle. They
are surely right to do so.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Worry about brand values has battered the shares of consumer products
companies. The once-dull Nestle, though, has emerged relatively unscathed.
Its geographic and product spread underscores its defensive attractions. But
the company has also been promoting its expansionist ambitions as it raises
SFr1.2bn of fresh equity and seeks a New York listing. US investors appear
especially attracted to Nestle, which contrasts with the seemingly secular
decline of their own food manufacturers. Nestle still appears to retain
considerable growth potential.
Since 1985, Nestle has spent Dollars 10bn on acquisitions which have yet to
bear full fruit. There may be scope for more. Philip Morris's determination
to defend its home turf in US tobacco may mean European food assets become
cheaper. Nestle's greatest volume growth is likely to come from developing
markets. It is well-placed in foods in the Far East and South America. While
European markets remain soft and US competition fierce Nestle seems likely
to bask in the sunshine. Unilever's shares, which have flagged recently, may
be better geared to recovery given its greater industrial interests.

FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK dairy sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The uncertain future of the UK's Pounds 3bn milk industry as the Milk
Marketing Board begins its death throes is unsettling investors. The share
prices of both Northern Foods and Unigate are curdling as a consequence.
The fear is that the demise of the Milk Marketing Board will simply
transform a statutory monopoly into an unregulated private one. Milk Marque
is likely to control far in excess of 50 per cent of the market, making it
the biggest purchaser of milk in Europe. It would have the power to steer
the UK market whichever way it chose  - although it would be hard to justify
higher prices given its promises of greater efficiencies.
In this scenario, Northern and Unigate would be squeezed by supply pressures
at one end of the milk chain while suffering margin erosion at the other as
supermarkets won ever more market share. Higher margin doorstep deliveries,
which accounted for almost 90 per cent of milk sales in 1980, may shrink to
less than 50 per cent by 1995. Milk may be 'commoditised' like bread.
But the parallels are inexact. Unlike bread, demand for milk has remained
stable and there is no great excess processing capacity. Milk will also
retain some premium for quality  - it is impossible to degrade the product
without being jailed. Moreover, the critical determinants of dairy
profitability will remain processing and distribution efficiencies with the
barriers to entry remaining high. Although there will undoubtedly be a
hiatus as the new regime takes shape, the market's worst fears appear
exaggerated.

FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Freedom of information
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett's ideas on how companies should manage the flow of information
will be useful to a market still coming to terms with the Thorold Mackie
insider trading case and the stock exchange censure of London International.
All the more so since the basic message is that companies should not use the
new, stricter climate on insider trading as an excuse to clam up. While
there is no justification for the selective dissemination of market-moving
information, Hoare Govett is right to say that the market's collective
judgment is improved if analysts can deepen their understanding through
regular contacts with companies. Such contacts will be more comfortable if
any price sensitive information has previously been put into the public
domain.
Where one can quibble is over quite how much more information compan-ies
should give. Hoare Govett would like to see more detail about strategy at
annual meetings as well as cash-flow figures and balance sheets at the
interim stage. If companies inform the market through a formal statement
when they feel investor expectations are out of line with reality, there
should be little likelihood of anything untoward slipping out in private
meetings with analysts. Hoare is less anxious to see regular trading
statements ahead of a company's closed season even though this leaves a long
gap between the interims and final results.
But if the market wants a less discriminatory flow of information, it cannot
also worry about getting too much. It is difficult to tell whether a given
development will move a share price by more than 5 per cent, the trigger
suggested by Hoare. Standard Chartered and Lucas must have assumed when
briefing analysts last week that their stories were not worth that much.
That this assumption turned out to be wrong reinforces the view that it is
better to give too much information than too little. Analysts could be just
as usefully employed picking through the detail as plucking a few ripe
strawberries out of the chairman's bowl at Wimbledon.

Presumably one of the reasons why Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar
feels so confident that he has not landed himself with another legal
nightmare when he pinched his new manager, Ossie Ardiles, from West Bromwich
Albion, is because Ardiles claims to be a trained lawyer.
Although Ardiles signed up for Cordoba at the tender age of 12, he learnt
his law during his time with Huracan Buenos Aires in the 1970's. Can anyone
remember any fledgling British barristers who forsook the silk for the
pitch? Failing that, a solicitor would do.

While Neil Kinnock struggles to carve out a new career as a disc
jockey-cum-game show celebrity, his former lieutenant Charles Clarke has
found a lucrative niche advising companies on how to dispense with the
costly services of professional lobbyists.
Most Westminster exiles end up as political lobbyists themselves, wining and
dining their former colleagues to promote clients' interests. Clarke, for
nearly 10 years Kinnock's chief of staff and leading 'fixer', has refused to
jump on that particular gravy train. His consultancy Quality Public Affairs
tells organisations how they can do their own lobbying more effectively for
a fraction of the cost. It's such a novel idea that it is probably only a
matter of time before Clarke gets an offer he can't refuse to sell out.

One of the stranger aspects of the Michael Mates / Asil Nadir affair is why
Mates would want to hang on to a job that most ordinary people would least
like to have  - that of being the Northern Ireland minister in charge of
security.
The chance of being blown up is far higher than average and the oppressive
security that goes with the job remains long after a minister steps down.
But politicians get their kicks in different ways.
Mates is a former soldier who appreciates the challenge of tackling some of
the world's most sophisticated, as well as merciless, terrorists. Northern
Ireland is also the closest British ministers can get to acting as mini
viceroys. The system of 'direct rule' from Westminster means few decisions
can be effectively challenged and the tight security can only add to the
sense of self-importance.
There should be no shortage of volunteers for Mates's job, if he should
decide to go.

If there really is no one in overall charge of the Government's publicity
machine, why did Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor of the exchequer, cancel
his chance of being grilled by Jonathan Dimbleby on the BBC TV's On the
Record yesterday? He would have been rewarded with handsome coverage in
today's papers.
Having scrapped the silly tradition of budget purdah just last week, it
seems odd that Clarke should suddenly fall silent now. Perhaps he lost his
nerve (unlikely), or Treasury officials have already convinced him he is
talking too much about something he doesn't know much about (possible).
Whatever the reason, the BBC was miffed at being let down at such short
notice - which is no bad thing. It might be a sign that Clarke wants to
prove that he, rather than the media, is in charge of setting the economic
agenda.

It says a lot about the changing face of Italian capitalism that Guido Rossi
should be imported to preside over the rescue of debt-ridden Ferruzzi. The
Harvard-trained lawyer, ex-head of stock exchange watch-dog Consob, has
acted as both insider and outsider in Italy's corporate world.
He has advised groups like Fiat, Olivetti and Generali, and made much money.
But  - as his 'Rossi the red' nickname testifies  - he has never hidden the
leftist sympathies which in 1987 gave him Communist Party backing as an
independent senatorial candidate for Milan.
He has long fiercely criticised the way Italian family businesses ignore
minority shareholders. Moreover, after quitting Consob in 1982, he described
the stock exchange as little more than a souk, and muttered darkly about
reform attempts always running up against a wall of vested interests.
Hence the new political climate should enable him to practise what he has
been preaching. Whether it will can only remain to be seen.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Where the EC must go next
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPENHAGEN summit occurs when the agonising struggle to ratify the
Maastricht treaty on European Union appears to be drawing to a close. This,
the culmination of years of effort, is a considerable collective achievement
for the European Community. But the world has moved on since economic and
monetary union was planned. So too must the EC. The summit has, for the most
part, the right agenda. The EC must now respond with a mixture of heroism
and common sense.
Its main task is to make itself appear more relevant to the lives of its
citizens and the fate of its troubled continent. Just when many hoped it had
come of age, it is mired in difficulties: blunderings in Yugoslavia,
squabbles with the US, friction over imports from eastern Europe, popular
resistance to the Maastricht treaty and, above all, the economic malaise.
Poor economic performance underlies everything else. Failure to respond to
German unification by allowing either a temporary float of the D-Mark or
upward realignment was a signal error. Partly as a result, the EC is not
only in recession, but in the third year of below-trend growth. More may be
to come.
Macroeconomic mistakes, however large, are not the principal economic
problem of the EC. With aggregate unemployment expected to reach 11 1/2 per
cent of the labour force, the debate about Eurosclerosis is back. This
follows 20 years of dismal labour market performance. While employment in
the private sector rose by 30m between 1973 and 1991 in North America, it
rose by a mere 3m in the EC.
The Copenhagen summit will look at the EC's role in the world economy, at
relations with eastern Europe, at enlargement and at security policy. It
will not find many solutions. But the EC's heads of government will have
taken the first essential step, particularly when they discuss the paper
from Mr Delors on the EC's structural economic crisis. What is needed, with
the Maastricht debate over, is appreciation of the EC's difficulties and a
clear sense of priorities.
THREE IMPORTANT TASKS
The pillars of the European Union are an unsatisfactory structure.
Democratic accountability of EC institutions remains inadequate,
particularly because of the virtually non-existent links to the national
parliaments. Country voting weights are illogical. Nevertheless, the EC
cannot afford another ratification process similar to that for the
Maastricht treaty. It must limit itself, instead, to the essential and the
practicable. There are three important tasks: to make the workings of the EC
and, above all, of the council of ministers more transparent and
accountable; to make 'subsidiarity' work; and to equip itself with
institutions that will make enlargement feasible.
The size of the qualifying majority in voting will need to be changed. So
too will voting weights in the council of ministers. At present, the five
largest member states have some 84 per cent of the EC's population, but only
63 per cent of the votes. After taking in four Efta members, these countries
would still have 78 per cent of the population, but about half the votes.
The disproportion would be made still worse by enlargement eastward. Being
so influenced by its smaller members, the Union would possess neither
legitimacy nor effectiveness, particularly in foreign and security policy. A
small high-level commission should be empowered to develop proposals for
institutional reform.
Continued efforts to develop the European Union's role in foreign and
security policy remain desirable. The EC's mistakes in Yugoslavia reveal
what has to be done, rather than the desirability of quietism. First of all,
Germany must be turned into a responsible partner in European security
policy. This does not necessarily mean a German seat on the Security
Council. However painful to British and French amour propre, an EC seat
might ultimately be a better idea. But first the EC would have to be
reformed, since the revolving EC presidency has demonstrated itself unequal
to the task of elaborating and implementing EC-wide positions.
The immediate external task for the EC is to support democracy and the
transition to a market economy throughout the continent. The EC promoted the
stability of democratic western Europe by both increasing its wealth and
binding its peoples together. The same opportunities should be offered to
its immediate neighbours, especially those struggling to escape the ruins of
communism. The improvements suggested by the Commission to the agreements
with eastern European countries are a start. But the EC will have to go
further. It must, for example, review its reform of the common agricultural
policy, largely to increase opportunities for eastern European agriculture.
Yet the EC's primary challenge is to adapt to a global economy that is
changing rapidly precisely because its own ideas about markets and liberal
trade are being adopted worldwide. The risk now is that the EC will give up
the battle and turn inwards. Successful completion of the Uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations remains vital. But even this would prove a
temporary victory if economic dynamism and high employment were not
regained.
Policies affecting the labour market fall largely within the domain of the
member states. But the EC has a role, partly because it has been given one
in both the Maastricht and previous treaties, but more fundamentally because
without a measure of agreement in this area different national policies will
lead to internal friction and growing protectionism, endangering liberal
external trade and the single market.
FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO CONVERGENCE
A new consensus must be formed, to allow member states to combine their core
social commitments with liberal trade and higher employment. Five
fundamental principles need to be proclaimed: first, the cost of financing
the welfare state should not be loaded on the wages of relatively unskilled
workers; second, education must be better integrated within active policies
for the labour market; third, assistance to workers should not be given in
ways that are likely to reduce the incentive of employers to hire them;
fourth, normally healthy adults should not be paid to be idle if they can be
subsidised to work, instead; and fifth, obstacles to the development of
small and medium-sized businesses, the principal potential source of
additional employment, should be drastically curtailed.
Meanwhile, EC macroeconomic policy must stop making it more difficult to
introduce needed reform into the labour markets. Against the current gloomy
background, strict adherence to Maastricht guidelines for fiscal policy
looks simply perverse. In 1993 only Luxembourg will hit the general
government borrowing target of 3 per cent of GDP, while the EC-wide
aggregate will be more than double the target. Combined with continued
monetary stringency, attempts to tighten fiscal policy would merely
aggravate the overall problem.
The EC must treat the convergence criteria flexibly. This may mean
postponing Emu until at least 1999. That would merely make reforming the
ERM, in order to reinforce the solidity of its core and increase flexibility
on the periphery, still more important. In the meantime, those who choose
both to accept the disciplines of the hard ERM and resist changes in the
system to make it more flexible should tolerate those outside the system,
provided they are trying to expand domestic demand.
The EC, soon to be the European Union, remains the heart of any effort to
secure a prosperous and secure future for Europe and a creative role for it
in the world. It cannot afford the luxury of despair; it cannot afford to
turn its back on its own problems; and it cannot afford to ignore its global
responsibilities. The euphoria of 1990 is gone. Now should come a new sense
of realism and purpose. The EC must relaunch itself. The Copenhagen summit
is where it should start to do so.

FT  21 JUN 93 / The case for an EC constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most important, but least discussed, of the Maastricht treaty
provisions is for an inter-governmental conference in 1996 or thereabouts on
the institutional and constitutional arrangements for European union. This
conference promises to be more important than Maastricht itself. For it will
provide an opportunity to clarify many matters which the treaty left open
and to say much more about the purposes and principles of the proposed
union. Those who want the EC to be free trading, outward looking and
welcoming to new members would be better advised to prepare for this
conference than to persevere with a hopeless last-ditch attempt to stop
Maastricht ratification.
One reason why the political side of Maastricht is such a rag-bag is that it
was tagged on to the monetary side at the last moment. Chancellor Kohl and
President Mitterrand decided that monetary union must have a political
counterpart, but without thinking through what that should be.
There is, however, time for a full public debate before the 1996 conference.
This should provide an opportunity to discuss principles before the haggling
between governments begins. There is a chance, too, of an agenda not
dominated by the power-seeking proclivities of Community institutions. Above
all, there should be time to consult with prospective members from Efta and
the former Communist countries.
But if the opportunity is not to be thrown away, it is important to force
politicians and diplomats back to first principles. The characteristic
instinct of the British Foreign Office for 'a narrow agenda' could not be
more counter-productive. Has that institution not paid a heavy enough price
in the whole postwar period for its hostility to general ideas?
A European group of academics and other professionals have had the much more
imaginative idea of drafting a 'European constitutional settlement'. The
work is being co-ordinated by Frank Vibert of the European Policy Forum, a
free market but pro-Community body (20 Queen Anne Street, London SW1H 7AA).
Not the least important of its draft recommendations is that 'the main
content of the union constitution should be accessible to any interested
reader'.
The existing treaties are impenetrable. Each consists of a series of
amendments to its predecessor. Interested citizens are much too dependent on
interpretations and summaries by government officials and experts, who,
however much they try not to, are bound to introduce their own spin.
The proposed constitution would be based on the inviolability of individual
liberty. Powers would flow upwards from the people rather than being
delegated by government. Above all, the pernicious doctrine of the acquis
communautaire would go. Under this the Community holds on to all the powers
it has been given and asks for some more. Instead, there would be sunset
provision under which policies and powers no longer required would be laid
to rest. Sub-groups of countries would be able to adopt, or stay out of,
particular policies in place of the grudging opt-outs recently obtained.
The new treaty would outlaw methods of agricultural support disruptive to
international trade and would allow direct cash subsidies to farmers to be
operated at a national level. Committee members disagreed about a Community
currency but agreed that a core group of countries should be able to go it
alone. They also agreed that citizens and companies would have the right to
use any member or non-member's currency, which would be recognised for tax
and accounting purposes. A Community currency would have to make its way
through its own virtues.
The draft needs further work. It reads too much like a generalised charter
for limited government without specifying why or how it applies specifically
to Europe. Moreover, it risks unnecessarily alienating opinion by
challenging sacred doctrines, such as 'an ever closer union', which mean
whatever we want them to mean. And, although nearly all committee members
are from outside the UK, there are hardly any with a communautaire
background - among whom a few limited-government liberals can indeed be
found, if one searches with a powerful enough microscope.
What however distinguishes the Vibert group from the mass of Euro-sceptics,
at least in the UK, is that its members do not set up a god of national
sovereignty to rival that of Brussels. Instead, they are suspicious of all
government and - unlike British Tory administrations - want to bring it down
to the lowest possible level.
Such ideas might once have seemed either utopian or old fashioned. But they
happen to meet the bill when we are considering a Europe of over 20
countries with highly divergent institutions and levels of economic
development.

FT  21 JUN 93 / The towering bureaucracy: The case for streamlining the
European Commission appears overwhelming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors intends to deliver a dazzling presentation on Europe's
unemployment crisis when he addresses the EC summit in Copenhagen today. His
speech is expected to be part tutorial, part clarion call - the result of
prodigious reading and tortured reflection on why Europe is failing to
create jobs at the same rate as the US and Asia.
The ability to synthesise ideas on a grand scale has been Mr Delors'
strength during eight and a half years as president of the European
Commission. But intellectual audacity has come at a price. He has shown a
reluctance to confront the practical task of reshaping an organisation
which, in many respects, has remained unchanged since the Community was
founded 36 years ago.
The case for reform appears overwhelming. The Commission employed 14,533
officials at the end of last year, about the same size as the UK agriculture
ministry. Yet the ambitions of the hautes fonctionnaires go much further.
Encouraged by the member states, the Commission has steadily accumulated new
tasks. Today, officials in Brussels are dealing with issues ranging from the
safety of nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and the disbursement
of aid to central and eastern Europe, to the deregulation of the European
telecommunications industry.
The question is whether the present two-year Commission can do all its jobs
effectively. As ratification of the Maastricht treaty draws closer and the
Community prepares for the next phase of enlargement, the challenges are
becoming more pressing. As one official says: 'We cannot go on with business
as usual.'
By any measure, the European Commission is a complex organisation. With 17
commissioners from 12 member states, it resembles less an executive branch
and more a mini-parliament. The bureaucracy itself is divided into a host of
competing power centres: the president, who controls his own cabinet and a
secretariat general; 16 commissioners, each with a cabinet or legislative
support staff; and the director-generals, the Brussels equivalent of UK
permanent secretaries.
The striking feature of the Delors era is that its chief successes - the
European single market, the plan for European monetary union, the creation
of the European Economic Area encompassing the EC and the Efta countries -
were achieved almost in defiance of the system's own internal weaknesses.
Mr Delors simply bypassed the old bureaucracy. 'He created a parallel
government,' explains a retired senior EC official who has worked closely
with the president, 'but in doing so, he made the Commission structures more
complicated than ever.'
Mr Delors has inserted his own people in the higher ranks of each of the 23
directorates. Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador in Washington, calls the
Delors regime 'Tammany Hall with a French accent', in a reference to the
powerful political machine that once ran New York City. This captures the
atmosphere of intrigue and occasional vendettas inside the Commission. The
broader criticism is that the member states, rather than Mr Delors, have put
patronage first and competence second.
Mr Delors has simply been worn down. In his early days as president, he
railed against member states exporting mediocrity to Brussels. He once
accused a Mediterranean commissioner of not being fit to run a taverna. His
views on the present Commission are more discreet, though there is some
grumbling about the amount of time Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the former
Portuguese foreign minister, has spent back in his native country since
arriving in Brussels in January.
Mr Pinheiro may complain, with justification, that he does not have a real
job. He is charged with introducing transparency into EC decision-making,
but few top officials in Brussels take this very seriously, knowing that it
is a sop to critics. As Mr Bruno Dethomas, the president's chief spokesman,
observed: 'La transparence est un etat d'esprit (a state of mind).'
The Commission still looks to be of slightly higher quality than its
predecessors. Mr Hans Van den Broek, in a new job covering external
political relations, is a former Dutch foreign minister; Sir Leon Brittan,
in charge of the trade portfolio, remains a heavyweight; Mr Karel van Miert,
the Belgian who took over Sir Leon's competition portfolio, is proving to be
tougher than expected on curbing state aid.
The quality of top officials is impressive, though perhaps thinly stretched.
Among the most outstanding are Mr Riccardo Perissich, the Italian head of
the industry directorate; Mr Carlo Trojan, a Dutch-Italian who played a
crucial role in co-ordinating EC policy during German unification; and Mr
Eneko Landaburu, the Basque head of regional policy.
But the division of labour among the commissioners and directorates is
unequal. Sir Leon's territorial clashes with Mr van den Broek have passed
into Brussels folklore. Both co-operated effectively on policy towards
eastern Europe, but both have behaved at times like feuding medieval barons.
Such folies de grandeur encourage the commissioners' cabinets to run
rough-shod over the Commission civil servants, who work in the directorates.
One German director-general resigned in protest at his treatment by Mr
Manuel Marin, the prickly Spaniard who heads development policy. The problem
of young, inexperienced cabinets ignoring professional advice is viewed as
so serious that Mr Delors is likely to prepare an edict ordering that the
advice of directors-general must be taken into account before framing
legislation.
The lack of policy co-ordination between commissioners and civil servants is
symptomatic of a deeper problem which goes to the heart of the schizophrenic
relationship between the Commission and the member states.
At this week's Copenhagen summit, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, will
champion the cause of 'subsidiarity' - the principle that power must be
devolved from Brussels to the lowest appropriate national, regional or
municipal level. British officials confidently expect support from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany as well as Mr Edouard Balladur, the French
prime minister.
Subsidiarity is supposed to be the antidote to Brussels meddling, but as an
EC official explains, whatever the Commission's reputation for perpetrating
legislative 'Euro-lunacies', the truth is most legislation is driven by
member states.
One topical example is animal welfare. A new directive would set strict
conditions on the transport of horses. The Commission is reluctant to
proceed on the grounds of 'subsidiarity', but Mr Major and Mr Kohl, worried
about the animal-lovers' vote, insist that the Commission presses ahead.
The member states are also held responsible by some officials for inserting
unnecessary details into directives. A senior EC official, who has worked in
Brussels for 20 years, says the member states 'do not trust each other'.
Mistrust also explains why the 12 EC member states have never shown much
interest in transforming the Commission into a lean executive branch of
European government. Their preference for protecting national powers remains
stronger than ever.
There are, however, reasons for assuming that the status quo cannot last,
and that some reform of the Commission is likely to take place before the
next inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996.
Last March, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Commission was
breaking EC rules by using national quotas rather than merit as the gauge
for recruiting high-ranking professional civil servants: it overruled the
appointment of an Italian and a Spaniard to senior posts in the Commission's
fisheries directorate. The court's ruling could have a profound impact on
hiring personnel.
An obvious reform is to reduce the number of commissioners to one per
country and streamline the directorates. Viscount Etienne Davignon, himself
a former industry commissioner, believes that nine or 10 directorates would
be enough. The next step would be to create two vice-presidents, with
heavyweight portfolios such as trade and economics; and to strengthen the
position of the president, subject to greater accountability to the European
parliament.
It sounds logical, but as Mr Delors has discovered, occasionally it suits
weak EC leaders to point to an inefficient Commission as a scapegoat for
their own inadequacies.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Voice of the little guy: The small shareholder's right to
speak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
And now old Jolyon (Forsyte) rose to present the report and accounts.
Veiling under a Jove-like serenity that perpetual antagonism deep-seated in
the bosom of a director towards his shareholders, he faced them calmly -
John Galsworthy, The Man of Property, 1906
Lord Hanson's recent attempt to curb his shareholders at their annual
general meetings has a distinguished pedigree. Hanson, it may be recalled,
aimed to restrict the scope for members to ask questions, nominate directors
or put forward resolutions. Last week, under pressure from big institutional
shareholders, he backed down. But his attempt will have struck a chord with
generations of chairmen, chivvied at their AGMs by activists on any topic
from apartheid to Aids and the environment.
Hanson was perhaps an unexpected company to try such a tactic. On the one
hand, its activities ought to make it a sitting target. It rips up large
tracts of countryside for coal and gravel, blots out even larger tracts with
monocultural forestry and makes a quarter of its profits from a dangerous
and addictive drug, tobacco. But its tightly controlled AGMs are calm and
complacent affairs, with only the occasional muted protest on behalf of
Navajo Indians or the medical profession.
The whole episode nevertheless raises the question of the purpose of AGMs.
For the professional investor, the sole interest normally lies in the
chairman's statement, which might or might not contain price-sensitive clues
on current trading. The rest is mostly ritual: the reappointment of
directors and auditors, a few token questions, a laudatory address from an
institutional shareholder and a cup of tea. If the meeting is formally
restricted to this, is any of its original purpose lost?
The law gives remarkably little guidance. The Companies Act sets down that a
company must hold an AGM at least once each calendar year. It says nothing
about what should happen at it. The handful of other things a company must
do, such as appoint auditors and lay the accounts before shareholders, need
not strictly be done at the AGM. The whole ritual is in fact a matter of
custom and practice, partly enshrined in the London Stock Exchange's
rulebook, but mostly at the company's own discretion.
There are rather more clues in the AGM's history. Mr Richard Fleck, a
partner in City law firm Herbert Smith, says: 'In the old days, everything
was done by partnerships. That required partners to agree on a course of
action, which could only be done in meetings, by majority vote. When limited
companies were allowed by law in the mid-19th century, that concept was
embodied in legislation.'
The next step was to allow a company to act on a majority not of its
members, but of those attending the meeting. 'That gave the meeting a status
it didn't have before,' Mr Fleck observes. 'It also meant a weakening of the
ways in which a company's members could act. What Hanson proposed would have
made it more restrictive again, by further concentrating power in the hands
of the board and a minority of powerful shareholders.'
It could be argued that this concentration of power happened long ago. The
financial institutions, acting alone or in established pressure groups, tell
companies what they want behind closed doors. The AGM functions chiefly as a
threat: if companies do not knuckle under, the argument will be conducted in
the open. Ironically, this is just what happened with Hanson. The
institutions made their objections in private, and a public vote on the
proposals was abandoned.
As might be expected, not all the institutions were opposed to Hanson. One
of the larger ones privately dismissed the objections as hot air.
Resolutions, it said, had to be given careful thought, not dreamt up at
meetings. There was no case for 'corporate governance by guerrilla ambush'.
Whether the institutions should be allowed to get away with this is another
matter. For one thing, around a quarter of the shares in the average UK
company are still held by individuals. For another, the institutions cannot
always be relied upon to speak with one voice, or in the right cause. In the
matter of excessive executive salaries and pensions, for instance, many are
hampered by the salaries they pay themselves.
There is another, more fundamental reason for not gagging the small
shareholder. Company directors and fund managers tend to be rather
conventional people. Being harangued by cranks and visionaries may be a
wearisome business. But on some issues, such as apartheid and the
environment, companies occasionally end up wishing they had listened to the
cranks earlier.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: Essential safeguards before giving central bank
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRENDAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The suggested provisions for democratic accountability of an
independent central bank which Samuel Brittan set out (Economic Viewpoint,
June 17) omit two safeguards essential to a new, more liberal order. First,
its policymaking committee should operate under a well-specified freedom of
information code, which would be fully enforceable in law. Under the code,
both parliamentarians and the general public should have full access to all
background papers to policy decisions, and comprehensive minutes should be
published of policymaking meetings with minimal delay - including a record
of which way individual members voted.
Second, top-level appointments in the central bank must be subject to
approval of a parliamentary committee where members vote without
interference by party whips. Analogous to Senate ratification of Federal
Reserve appointments, members of the committee would cross-examine
candidates towards assessing their competence. Questions could be raised,
for example, as to the candidate's role in the Pounds 5bn estimated loss on
Black Wednesday, and his or her attitude towards previous monetary
decisions. Independence should not take effect until all positions on the
top policymaking committee, including present officials, have been ratified
accordingly.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: Factors behind the swift decline in unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof R R NEILD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It has been suggested that the unexpectedly swift decline in
unemployment relative to the recovery in output may have been caused by
changes in labour law or in the way in which the unemployed are registered.
But another possible contributory cause seems to have been overlooked.
In response to the changes that have taken place in the tax system and in
capital markets, companies are now paying out more of their profits in
interest and dividends and are retaining less; and they have become more
afraid than they used to be of being taken over if they cut their dividends.
Consequently, when output has fallen, they have felt obliged to act more
quickly than before to save their profits by cutting employment; and now,
left with no margin of labour to spare, they have to act more quickly than
before to take on labour when demand for their products recovers.
The corollary is that productivity will fluctuate less than before in the
business cycle: it will keep up better in the downswing, as has happened;
and it will show less of a recovery in the upswing. And the economy will be
more volatile, since any initial change in demand will be transmitted more
quickly than before into changes in employment, and hence into changes in
consumer spending, and it will be cushioned less than before by company
savings.
These effects may have been amplified by the reduction in the rate of
corporation tax in recent years. For if a smaller part of profits is taken
in tax, a smaller part of the profits that are foregone by a company when it
retains an extra employee comes out of the revenue of the exchequer, and a
larger part out of the post-tax income of the company. The pressure to
dismiss labour is intensified.
What effect the changes that have taken place in the financing and taxation
of companies have had on their underlying efficiency is a separate issue. My
concern is to explain the apparent change in the cyclical behaviour of
employment.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: How ITV companies missed out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CHECKETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The ITV companies are fearful of being taken over by other Europeans
once the takeover rules are relaxed. It is worth noting that not a single
British broadcasting company owns an interest in any continental European
television network.
The ITV network was founded in the mid-1950s. Commercial television did not
arrive elsewhere in Europe until 30 years later. With almost arrogant
disdain, British broadcasters have ignored the opportunity to invest in what
have subsequently become very valuable franchises in Germany, France, Spain
and the rest of northern Europe.
Other European TV companies, such as Luxembourg's CLT, Germany's Kirch
Group, Italy's Fininvest and France's Canal+ have all successfully invested
outside their domestic territories. Granada did buy 3 per cent of Canal+ in
1987 but sold it a year later. Canal+'s share price has subsequently more
than doubled.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: The CAB and employees' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANN ABRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing to correct an inaccuracy in your report, 'Union
restrictions extended by new law' (June 18), which seriously misrepresents
the position of the Citizens Advice Bureaux Service. The CAB service, while
recommending that individual employment rights should be strengthened, has
never argued that this should supersede collective bargaining. The service
sees no contradiction between the role of collective bargaining and
strengthening individual employment rights.
When clients come to a CAB with an employment problem, they will be advised
to consult their trade union or staff association if they are members. This
is because the union or staff association will have detailed knowledge of
the employer's practices and will be able to represent the client most
effectively. Involvement of a trade union will almost always strengthen the
client's position. If the client is not in a trade union, or does not wish
to consult one, the CAB will always offer advice and representation as
appropriate.
Employment is now the third highest subject of inquiries to Citizens Advice
Bureaux. While some elements of the new legislation will undoubtedly be
beneficial to CAB clients, the service remains extremely concerned about a
number of provisions in the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill,
in particular the abolition of wages councils. In the absence of collective
bargaining in the sectors covered by wages councils, their abolition is
likely to result in a decrease in wages and increased dependence on social
security benefits, as was pointed out by your editorial 'Waging war'
(November 6 1992).

FT  21 JUN 93 / Disciplinarian with a vision: Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan
governor, talks to Richard Lambert and Charles Leadbeater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The calm at the Bank of Japan's imposing headquarters in Tokyo, one of only
a handful of buildings in the city which survived the 1923 earthquake, was
unruffled on Friday afternoon by the tumultuous events unfolding in the
Japanese parliament.
As the Japanese government watched its authority slip away, Mr Yasushi
Mieno, the bank's redoubtable governor, was unperturbed.
Mr Mieno, who became governor in late 1989, is far more than a central
banker. He is a fiercely, skilfully independent figure who inspires loyalty
among his staff, commands respect from his peers and provokes anger among
many politicians who believe he should be their servant. The Bank of Japan's
formal independence from the finance ministry and its political masters is
limited, but Mr Mieno has won more autonomy for the bank than any recent
governor.
Yet the 69-year-old governor is not a dry technocrat. His views on the role
of monetary policy are spiced with reflections upon everyday life. Mr Mieno
has a vision of Japan that stretches beyond economics into the nation's
moral and social wellbeing. That clarity of purpose will be particularly
important in the next few months as Japan enters a period of political
instability and uncertainty, ushered in by the government's defeat on Friday
in a no-confidence vote.
The general election on July 18 is widely expected to leave the country with
a weak and unstable government. Amid the uncertainty, Mr Mieno's authority
will be vital to lend stability to economic policy.
The political upheaval has come at a time when the economy is 'in a very
delicate stage', Mr Mieno says, after a two-year downturn from the high
growth of the late 1980s. The length and profound adjustment may be nearing
its end, he indicated.
'Starting from the latter half of 1993 we can expect the economy will start
recovering, although it will be mild,' he explained.
The government's pump priming measures, worth about Y24,000bn since last
August, combined with interest rates at a historic low of 2.5 per cent,
should support the economy, Mr Mieno believes, while the 'foundations for
private autonomous recovery in the latter half of fiscal year 1993 are
steadily being prepared'.
This autonomous recovery in personal consumption and capital investment
should be underpinned by the improving health of the Japanese banking
system. The main Japanese banks are heavily burdened by bad debts, the
aftermath of the collapse of the speculative property market of the late
1980s.
Mr Mieno believes the banks are sorting out their problems by cutting costs,
aggressively writing off bad loans and rebuilding their weakened balance
sheets. Yet he is careful not to overstate the banks' progress: 'It is
steady and good, in the right direction, but I would not say it was very
bold.'
The main danger is the deflationary impact of the yen's rapid appreciation
against the dollar. The yen rose from about Y125 to the dollar at the turn
of the year to about Y105 early last week. The political crisis is expected
to pull the yen back to at least Y110.
Mr Mieno said he would 'keep a close watch on the deflationary impact of the
strong yen'. Yet the yen's strength will be only one factor he will take
into account in deciding whether to cut interest rates again, as many Tokyo
financial analysts expect him to.
The yen's rise has complicated the bank's main mission, which Mr Mieno said
was to 'stabilise the value of the currency and stabilise the financial
system'.
He went on: 'Generally speaking, when there is a sharp fluctuation in the
value of the currency by a sharp deflation or inflation, at the same time it
is very difficult to keep a sound financial system.'
Mr Mieno won his reputation as a disciplinarian by raising interest rates
four times to 6 per cent in the 10 months after he become governor, to
deflate the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. Yet he was closely
involved in the bank's earlier decision to keep interest rates at 2.5 per
cent for more than two years from February 1987, which help to inflate the
bubble.
This laxity is now the cause for contrition: 'I regret that we did not act
much faster. We kept our interest rates low for a long period of time.'
The mistakes which led to the bubble have left a deep scar upon Japan's
elite of economic bureaucrats. Mr Mieno is no exception, believing that the
bubble was not just an economic problem for Japan, but also a threat to its
moral fibre. He explained: 'The bubble taught us the dreadfulness of the
speculative economy.' The awfulness of economic excess was matched by a
social danger: speculation threatened to undermine the work ethic and
Japan's relatively egalitarian distribution of income.
Mr Mieno said: 'The bubble hurt the soundness and stability of Japanese
society. The efforts of labour which is to work with sweat on your forehead
has been weakened. Morale was reduced and there was unfairness in the
distribution of wealth.'
With the bubble's painful lessons learnt, Mr Mieno is optimistic about the
economy's long-term potential as long as Japan plays to its strengths. He
said: 'In the postwar era three factors contributed to Japan's economic
growth: high levels of saving, a hard working attitude and great
entrepreneurship.'
To foster the latter quality in particular Mr Mieno believes further
deregulation is required, a theme that the governor believes should guide
Japan's response to US demands for a cut in the Japanese trade surplus which
is expected to reach Dollars 150bn this year.
'First, we should keep our economy on a non-inflationary stable path and
second we should deregulate and reconsider our trading practices to open up
our market further,' he said.
As far as economic stimulus to boost demand for imports is concerned, Mr
Mieno said: 'We have already done what we can on the economy.' He added that
the trade imbalance with the US mainly resulted from Japan's high savings,
which constrained consumption and demand for imports.
Mr Mieno warned that Japan and its trading partners would pay a high price
if Japan tried to cut the surplus rapidly through stimulating its economy:
'That will certainly create inflation and would not be good for the Japanese
economy or for the stable growth of the world economy.'
The alternative was further structural reform to 'heighten the transparency
of our market and our economic system', he said.
Mr Mieno does not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing the
Japanese economy. 'The Japanese economy is facing a task which we have not
experienced before, factors such as a sharp increase in the old-age
population, changes in working habits and the after-effects of the bubble.
All these could restrict the growth of the Japanese economy,' he noted.
Yet Mr Mieno is undaunted: his sense of discipline is the source of his
confidence. Mr Mieno's generation believes the austerity it underwent amid
the poverty after the second world war was the foundation for the high
growth that followed in the 1950s and 1960s. In Japan low inflation can be
delivered without high unemployment and low growth, Mr Mineo believes.
So the suggestion that the Japanese economy may grow more slowly in the
future provokes a sweeping dismissal: it would be tantamount to failure.
Mr Mieno concluded: 'I am rather optimistic for the longer term. The idea
that we should learn to live under low economic growth is a pathetic
notion.'

<TEXT>
Sir, Your coverage of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
seems to have been targeted mainly against its founder president, Mr Jacques
Attali. At no time have you highlighted the constructive work he has done.
You know very well that offices built just 10-15 years ago are out of date
for modern purposes, so you cannot blame Mr Attali if his deputies took into
consideration the needs of today and tomorrow.
You attack his travelling expenses, but he has serious responsibilities, and
time and other factors have to be considered. It is ridiculous that you
should pick on an establishment with so much importance in the way you are
doing.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Photographing a changing City - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking at cities is the best possible way of learning about architecture.
The City of London is a a microcosm of the architectural world - and one
that is facing problems of renewal after the recent terrorist outrages.
There is a whole crop of new committees, public relations outfits and
quangos dedicated to the promotion of London, but none of them stress the
extraordinary quality of the built world of the City. The best way of
understanding a city is to immerse yourself in its changes by walking about
it. Even better is to walk about it with a camera.
In the excellent Museum of London in the Barbican until July 4 is an
exhibition, The Square Mile, that focuses on the City of London through the
lens of the camera of artist-photographer Tom Evans. He trained as an
architect in Bristol and spent the early part of his career as a personal
design assistant to the great engineer, the late Sir Ove Arup. Today he runs
a consortium known as CITE, which is concerned with new technology, design
and the visual arts, when he is not taking photographs.
What is fascinating about his view of the City of London is that it is
concerned with architecture as a force for change. He demonstrates that a
photograph can make you look again at what you thought was familiar. He also
shows that it is possible to record those crucial moments when a city alters
direction or destroys a part of itself to renew another part.
Tom Evans began his photographic odyssey in the City in 1989, at the height
of the great Thatcher building boom. In many ways the City threw caution to
the winds, galvanised by the illusory 'threat' of Docklands. Planners and
politicians encouraged changes which led to a level of redevelopment that
had not been seen since the years following the Blitz. Electronic miracles
were to change architecture and office planning for ever - although this is
something that has not yet been fully grasped. New buildings grew like
mushroom spores: some were filled but many were not.
The financial climate of the 1980s acted as a great catalyst for
architectural change. Some developers welcomed it with open arms and tried
to accept the fact that buildings now have to wear new clothes - or may even
have to wear no recognisable clothes at all. Other developers tried hard to
hang on to their old clothes, or revive them in new materials. As Tom Evans
says in the introduction, 'a new chapter of the City's history was visibly
being written in steel, glass and concrete, and the forms created have led
to heated debates about the very nature of architecture, planning, and even
the purpose of the City itself.'
The NatWest tower, designed by Richard Seifert in 1970, was, at 600 feet,
the highest building in the City. Now its future is very uncertain: damaged
by bombs but not ruined, can it be rebuilt or should it be demolished to
allow a new tower to rise? The photograph that shows it, in 1989 from
Threadneedle Street, almost suggests its temporary character.
In a special section of the exhibition Mr Evans reminds us that in the City
the houses of God stand very close to the houses of Mammon. Too close for
comfort in the case of Saint Ethelburga's, which was recently bombed in
Bishopsgate despite having survived the Great Fire and the Blitz. But he is
right to make us look again at the glories of St. Dunstan's tower; All
Hallows London Wall; St. Helen's; St. Lawrence Jewry and St. Nicholas Cole
Abbey. We should not forget the wonderful interiors of the City's churches;
look again at St. Magnus Martyr in Lower Thames Street and forget the horror
of the endless stream of passing cars, reflecting upon what T. S. Eliot
called the, 'inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.'
Only a good photographer or an artist can draw attention to the spaces
between buildings; they matter as much as actual buildings in the whole
scheme of a city. In many of the newer developments, especially Broadgate, a
great deal of thought and design has gone into the new squares and atria.
Exchange House from Primrose Street is a good place to see the approach of a
careful developer who shows concern for the City as well as his profits. The
Thames and the sky are both City spaces and the camera focuses our eyes on
the scale and the whole nature of the spaces we move around in each day.
I had almost forgotten that the City of London does still have tiny
courtyards and alleys - St. Michael's Alley; George Yard; Nicholas Lane. All
are agreeable and part of the more human scale that all cities need. Mr
Evans quotes Gustave Dore's wonderful lines written in the 1870s about 'the
narrow streets and lanes of the City' where he found 'tumultuous episodes of
energetic money-making life'. So unlike the silent moves of a silver
computer screen.
It was a brave idea to try and show how a close examination of the fabric of
the City reflects wealth and status. The polished mahogany of old fashioned
tailoring shops; the heavy stonework of the Bank of England; the pompous
doors of great institutions and the festive facades of St. Paul's Cathedral.
What can you say about the thin marble veneers of the 1980s and the sham
classicism and strange detail of so many recent buildings? It is the new top
layers of the City that are added by every generation that both shock and
fascinate. These pictures show the City as a palimpsest in stone and
concrete and cheap veneer - and they subtly reveal to us the nature of
architectural change. They are a challenge to make you go out into the
streets of the City and look and experience the sense of flux: an experience
that combines both pleasure and pain.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: William Golding - Lord of the sea / Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I happened to be there when Sir William Golding, who died on Friday aged 81,
met Auden for the first time. After saying how much he had enjoyed Lord of
the Flies - the first novel with which Golding leapt to fame in 1954 - Auden
added that he thought the older boys on the desert island would have been
more protective towards the younger ones. He felt that the appalling
cruelties perpetrated as the boys fight for survival would not have happened
in the way Golding described.
Golding's reply came without any hesitation: 'Oh, they might have been
protective for a while. But not in the end. It's a question of time.
Seemingly endless time. That was what would have defeated their
benevolence.'
If one had to try to formulate a single theme underlying Golding's entire
work as a writer of fiction, it would be this: survival in an extreme
situation where time seems endless and there is no reprieve. It would apply
as much to the early books as to his last great work, the sea-faring trilogy
To the Ends of the Earth (Rites of Passage, Close Quarters and Fire Down
Below) revealing how the passengers and crew in one of the old 18th century
square-riggers try to survive amidst the hazards of a voyage to New Zealand.
This work was an achievement of remarkable vigour and imaginative complexity
for a writer in his seventies. A similar celebration of heroic endurance
underlies such earlier triumphs as The Spire, Free Fall, Pincher Martin,
Darkness Visible, all of them works of great originality.
Golding served in the navy during the war and never lost his love of the
sea. When he left the service he tried to become an actor (see The Pyramid).
Then he became a classics teacher before the success of his first book
enabled him to retire from that profession. He lived for many years at Broad
Chalke near Salisbury and then in Cornwall where sailing was one of his
chief recreations. Another was the game of chess which he played with a
cheerful aggression.
I had many enjoyable games with him in recent years - not over the board but
by correspondence. In one of them in 1983 he was in a winning position when
the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature intervened and amidst all the
excitement he failed to see that he had left either a rook or a bishop
exposed to capture by my knight. 'Oh fork it]' he wrote back in a note
announcing his resignation, and requesting a new game.
Golding's occasional visits to London were much treasured by his many
friends in the literary world. Many of those attended a luncheon to
celebrate his 80th birthday given by his publishers, Faber. The guest-list
spanned several generations of literary life from the poet Stephen Spender
to the novelist Ishiguro as well as a strong group up from Cornwall. It was
some indication of the respect with which Golding was regarded by his peers.
If personal memories of him will fade with time, his work seems certain to
endure.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Goehr and Takemitsu - Aldeburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toru Takemitsu is the featured composer at Aldeburgh this year, and Peter
Serkin very much the featured performer. Richard Fairman mentioned Serkin's
performance of the Goldberg Variations in his report on the opening weekend
and the pianist appeared again at the Snape Maltings on Friday, when Oliver
Knussen conducted the London Sinfonietta in an enterprising 20th century
programme which was also relayed on BBC Radio 3.
There was the statutory piece of Britten - the Nocturne sung by Adrian
Thompson - and an hors d'oeuvre from Knussen himself in the shape of his
1978 Skryabin Settings, piano miniatures craftily turned into
chamber-orchestra studies. Between them Serkin revived Alexander Goehr's
Piano Concerto from 1972, and Knussen introduced Takemitsu's Archipelago S,
commissioned by the festival.
Goehr's Concerto was written for Daniel Barenboim and is full of pianistic
touches and tangled, sinewy keyboard writing. As so often in Goehr the
argument seems driven by its harmony rather than its rhythm; there are
ghosts of classical archetypes behind its pair of movements, and an
orchestral palette designed to keep the accompaniments bright and limpid.
The burden of the argument is consistently taken by the soloist and Serkin
projected it all superbly, giving Goehr's lines a brittle lyricism and bite
which made light of the work's complexities. The rewards come slowly and
only sporadically through the first movement, but the second, hybridising
slow movement and finale, moves towards a very positive climax in which
Serkin was bold and thrillingly convincing.
Archipelago S. proved to be another luminous sample of Takemitsu's Debussyan
poetry, a 14-minute essay in call and response between three antiphonal
groups and a pair of solo clarinets stationed at the back of the hall. The
title comes with Takemitsu's usual bundle of allusions: the 'S' refers to
archipelagos - Stockholm, Seattle, the Seto Inland Sea - which have most
captured the composer's imagination, and to Snape itself. 'I wanted to
create a piece', says Takemitsu, 'wherein the (instrumental) islands calling
out to each other across the great distances separating them could be
experienced as a metaphor for the universe.'
There are some stirring exchanges, melodic figures that are passed around
the groups then out to the offshore clarinets and back again, almost
theatrical pronouncements by solo trumpets and horns, and impressionist
washes which round out the sound world. It is music of the rhapsodic moment,
full of beautiful sound objects faultlessly arrayed. In this performance
everything was in place; the extreme precision that Takemitsu's poetry
demands was impressively achieved by Knussen and the 21 Sinfonietta players.
* The 'Composer's Portrait' has become a regular fixture at Aldeburgh. The
subject this year was Peter Paul Nash, whose programme on Saturday afternoon
included three of his own works interspersed with piano pieces by Ravel,
Sibelius, Bach and Norgard, neatly played by Rolf Hind. Two song cycles sung
by Sarah Leonard - the student Terrace from 1971, setting Wallace Stevens in
a post-Schoenberg, post-Ravel mode, and the 1988 In a Walled Garden on
Tennyson - were invoked to demonstrate the development in Nash's style,
though the difference seemed much more a question of attitude, of ironic
undercutting in the later work, than of profound linguistic changes.
The novelty was the first performance of Nash's Second String Quartet,
introduced by the Brindisi Quartet. It's a subtle and intriguing 12-minute
structure fashioned from a sequence of a dozen aphoristic movements, which
on another level are shaped into an introduction-fast-slow scheme. Towards
the close chiming bells are heard, and the music delves back into the 19th
century (was it to Smetana perhaps, or Sibelius?) for a fond reminiscence
before moving on to an enigmatic close.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Singing in snippets - BBC 'Cardiff Singer of the
World'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A basic unfairness of the biennial Cardiff singing competition is something
its team of judges can do nothing to rectify: that is, that the human
equivalent of a cello should be required to compete against that of a
piccolo, bassoon against violin, xylophone against trombone. (There is an
even more basic unfairness - that singers in the business of forming
themselves as artists should be pressured into seeking this artificial boost
up the career-ladder at all - but as it is intrinsic to all musical
competitions, even I hardly dare hold the 'Singer of the World' originators
responsible.)
Still, this year's event did make clear just how highly this competition now
rates internationally. The seven-person panel of judges, chaired by the
Welsh National's Matthew Epstein and including Joan Sutherland, Marilyn
Horne and Gerard Souzay, was distinguished. Twenty-five countries had sent a
singer each to Cardiff; to judge from last week's nightly television
evidence of the five semi-finals (of which more later), not one fell below a
certain level of professional competence, and I have a hunch several
unrepresented in the St David's Hall final on Saturday will go on to have
useful careers.
Best of all - or worst, depending on one's view of the seemliness of first
prizes in such circumstances - the five finalists were all singers of
considerable merit. Different merit, that is: different artistic ambition,
stage of vocal development, quality of personality. The winner was Inger
Dam-Jensen (29, Denmark): this was a safe, popular and eminently arguable
choice, since she has charm of person, a 'finish' to her clean, bright,
agile high soprano, enviable efficiency of delivery in the spotlight. I
found her range of colour and emotional expression oddly limited (in the
Mozart concert aria 'Misera] dove son?' particularly).
Myself, I should have lobbied hard for the other Scandinavian soprano, Nina
Stemme (30, Sweden), plainly a front-rank Wagnerian and Straussian in early
bloom, with soft-textured warmth in her tone, gracious, long-lined phrasing,
and a top that shiningly filled the hall without forcing. Maybe her choice -
Lia's air from Debussy's Enfant Prodigue, Mimi's 'D'onde lieta usci',
'Leise, leise' from Der Freischutz - was too unshowy, her whole approach too
'inward'; but then, such marks of artistic seriousness are seldom
competition advantage-points.
I should also have been prepared to accept the case for the Ukrainian-born,
Kirov-based baritone Vassily Guerelo (30), whose out-of-form discomforts (he
had a cold) could not disguise the grandeur, tonal substance and
old-fashioned clout of a truly significant vocal instrument, yet another in
the astonishing recent Kirov baritone line.
Paul Whelan (26), a giant New Zealander, took the Lieder prize. He had
offered both the most adventurous programme and the greatest versatility; at
this young age his hugely promising big bass-baritone is not yet 'true'
throughout its range. Tito Beltran (27, Chile) cultivated audience favour by
closing with 'Nessun dorma'; he too has youthful promise (notably a clean,
unforced top, as shown in Faust's cavatina), and charm of person, not enough
of which seems to filter into his stock of Latin-tenor emotions and vocal
postures.
In the hall on Saturday evening one could at last judge each of these
singers 'as is'. This was a relief after the five preceding BBC-2
programmes, not one of which I had been able to watch without mounting rage.
Each was 50 minutes long yet by no means a full or even reasonable sampling
of the semi-final singers. Instead, we were given programme Presentation
with a capital P: much interspersed chitchat, pretty pictures of Cardiff
arcades, a liberal smearing of 'feel-good' jollification.
The habit of snipping of singers' items to make room for all the 'context'
touched its anti-artistic nadir on Friday, when Guerelo's Macbeth excerpt
was shorn of its aria proper. The expert commentators seemed to be placed on
oath not to utter any word of meaningful vocal criticism (but Elaine Padmore
on Tuesday and Mark Elder on Wednesday managed to sneak wise comment under
the barbed wire). Television accounts of cricket, tennis or snooker
competitions are not subjected to so shaming a brand of
popularisation-sweetening. That it should be deemed necessary for opera says
a lot about current levels of culture at the BBC.

<TEXT>
ALFRED McALPINE SERVICES AND PIPELINES has been awarded contracts worth
Pounds 20m since April.
The largest of the contracts is worth Pounds 15m and involves the
construction of foul and storm water outfalls for Southern Water Services at
east Worthing. The work is being carried out to comply with an European
Community directive for the improvement of the coastal environment. On
completion in December the foul water outfall will be one of the longest in
Europe.
British Gas has awarded Alfred McAlpine two contracts with a total value of
Pounds 5m. The first, worth Pounds 3m, is to lay a 900mm diameter overland
pipeline between the gas offtake installation at Huntingdon and two new
installations to be constructed as part of these works at St Neots and
Little Barford in Cambridgeshire. The work is due to be completed in
October.
The second is for the construction of a 9km long pipeline connecting Horndon
on the Hill to the gas offtake installation at Tilbury in Essex.

A Pounds 15.5m package of new contracts has been placed with TEAM SERVICES,
based in London. They include the refurbishment of 26 gate lounges, six
coach gates and three passenger piers for BAA at Heathrow's Terminal 3.
Team tendered successfully for the design and build project after first
being appointed to provide construction consultancy services. Work is to be
phased over 20 months enabling the airport to carry on normally.
Team is also involved in projects in Wales. At the University of Wales
College of Cardiff 502 residential accommodation units are being provided
for students with another 207 en suite rooms at Gwent College of Higher
Education.
Both projects, at a total cost of Pounds 8.7m, must be completed in time for
the next student intake.
Also in Wales, the company is to undertake the design and manage the
construction of a 35,000 sq ft extension and a car park at South Wales
Electricity's headquarters in Cardiff. This is the second of two, similar
projects.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (4): Shareholders show
support / Profile of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Pertti Voutilainen took over as chief executive of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki last year, his move from a state-owned mining group
to the private sector banking world prompted a student to ask what qualified
him for the job, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
'My experience of running state-owned companies,' he replied.
The joke, which reflected on a growing state role in the rescue of Finland's
beleaguered banking sector, could easily have gone sour as the country's
leading commercial bank turned out to be in much worse shape than he
expected when he first arrived.
In 1992 it piled up a FM3.7bn deficit, more than double 1991's FM1.61bn
loss, after lending losses tripled to FM4.27bn from FM1.34bn. In August it
availed itself of a FM1.73bn injection of preference capital from the
government and by the end of the year it looked a clear candidate for a more
extensive state bail-out.
Since then, though, things have started to look up. Losses have begun to
show a declining trend, thanks to the steep fall in Finnish interest rates
since last autumn. Just as importantly, the bank has successfully raised
FM1bn through a rights issue, demonstrating strong shareholder support for
its efforts to solve its problems on its own and reducing the likelihood
that it will need to ask for state assistance.
The decisive move came in February when KOP announced plans to raise some
FM3bn through a rights issue and domestic and international debt issues. It
was the first bank in the region to ask shareholders to help it to weather
the financial crisis and there was widespread scepticism about its chances
of success given the broader difficulties within Finnish banking.
In fact, KOP not only raised the FM930m it was originally seeking, but it
marginally increased the size of the issue to FM1bn because of
over-subscription. Part of the reason for its success was the
almost-missionary zeal with which it appealed to small shareholders across
the land to 'save' the bank from state clutches.
Another important factor was the bank's increasingly optimistic tone about
its recovery prospects. Mr Voutilainen says he expects the bank's loss for
1993 to halve to about FM2bn, on the back of lower credit losses, with a
return to profit by 1995.
There has been some scepticism about these projections, with some analysts
predicting that the bank could still make a loss of FM3-3.5bn this year.
They draw attention to the depressed state of the domestic economy and say
credit losses from small and medium-sized businesses will still be huge.
Furthermore, loan losses in the municipal and household sectors are rising.
Mr Voutilainen cautions that the bank's recovery hinges on wider economic
recovery. 'The bank is sick because the economy of our country is sick,' he
says.
He also accepts that the bank needs to raise more capital to strengthen its
capital base, as losses continue to erode its 9 per cent international
capital adequacy ratio. The plan is to raise about FM2bn this year and next
through a series of domestic and international debt issues. A bond issue in
the domestic market to raise FM300m has already been launched and it is
expected to be supplemented by issues for a further FM500m-FM1bn later in
the year.
In addition, analysts believe the bank may launch another rights issue when
it believes the market can digest it.
The Finnish banking crisis has taken its toll on KOP in a number of ways. It
has forced rationalisation, with staff numbers being cut last year by 8 per
cent to 8,500. It has also led to a more focused international strategy,
with the emphasis now on treasury operations and the funding of domestic
clients abroad. Gone are the days when the group would readily build up a
FM200m exposure to an international property group such as Olympia &amp; York.
Inevitably the focus is much more on the domestic market, where KOP is
playing its part in the wider reshaping of the banking sector. Already this
year it has taken a significant step with a takeover of the country's
sixth-largest bank, STS, in a move which has boosted its presence in the
household sector and in the Helsinki region.
It has also held discussions with the state authorities about a takeover of
the two savings bank groups, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland.
Such a move would give it a theoretical market share of 40 per cent and has
been resisted by the bank's competitors. In any case, Merrill Lynch has now
been called in to examine all options for the future of the two groups, so
the talks with KOP are on the back burner.
Mr Voutilainen says further restructuring in the banking sector is
inevitable in a country which is 'over-branched if not over-banked.' Of the
main banks which today command a nationwide network - KOP, Unitas,
Postipankki, Okobank and the savings banks - he believes at least one and
possibly two will disappear.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (3): Return to growth
likely to be slow - How the banking sector is expected to recover its health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY DIFFERENT factors contributed to the slew of banking losses across the
Nordic region and prescriptions vary from country to country on the way to
get out of the mess. But at least one feature - a recovery from general
economic stagnation and recession - is regarded by all as a key condition
for a return to health in the banking sector.
Overall, the outlook is improving after three years in which the economies
of Finland and Sweden have shrunk and those of Denmark and Norway have done
little better than stand still. But the return to growth is likely to be
painfully slow, offering little more than a modest lift to the convalescent
financial institutions.
The brightest forecasts come from Copenhagen and Oslo. The Danish government
revised its estimates for GDP growth to 1 per cent this year and 3.1 per
cent in 1994 when it announced a package of tax reforms after the
electorate's approval of the European Community's Maastricht Treaty in a
second referendum last month. Latest OECD figures predict growth in Norway
this year of 1.3 per cent, rising to 3.8 per cent next year.
In Finland and Sweden, however, progress is set to be much slower. Finland,
where the economy contracted by almost 10 per cent over the course of 1991
and 1992, is expected to shrink by up to another 1 per cent this year before
limping back to marginal growth in 1994. For Sweden, the picture is not much
less depressing, given the country's long record as the industrial and
manufacturing powerhouse of the region. This year GDP is set to decline by
1.7 per cent for the third year in succession; next year, there should be a
return to growth, but only of between 1.5 and 2 per cent, according to most
predictions.
The most pressing political problem that the recession has produced for the
region's governments is unemployment, which has soared as high as 17 per
cent of the workforce in Finland. In Denmark it is around 12 per cent, as it
is in Sweden when those on government retraining schemes are counted in.
Even Norway, bolstered by its flow of oil revenues, has an official jobless
rate of 5.6 per cent, and a real rate several points higher when those on
retraining schemes are included. The acute rates of unemployment among young
people - which can be as high as 30 per cent - are particularly worrying.
The Social Democratic-led government in Denmark, with a current account
surplus and a low budget deficit, has opted for some expansionary policies
to 'break the curve of rising unemployment'. But the other countries have
less room to manoeuvre.
Norway, again with the relative luxury of oil revenues, has adopted an
expansive fiscal policy since 1989 to try to control unemployment. But the
minority Labour government in Oslo is under pressure from the Bank of Norway
to tighten spending as the non-oil budget deficit has approached 9 per cent
of GDP. The deficit in Finland is of similar proportions, while in Sweden it
is even higher, at 13 per cent of GDP.
The conservative-led coalition in Stockholm has announced a tough series of
spending cuts to strengthen the budget by SKr81bn over five years, but that
will bring the budget deficit only down to 4 per cent of GDP by 1998. From
the banks' perspective, however, there has been a very significant
improvement in conditions in recent months in the form of falling interest
rates, the effects of which should continue to be felt by them through this
year and into 1994.
The Nordic countries were all embroiled in the currency turbulence that
swept western Europe last autumn. Denmark, a core member of the Exchange
Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, successfully defended the
Danish kroner's parity. Norway, Sweden and Finland, all aligned with the ERM
in anticipation of eventual EC membership, tried to do the same, but were
eventually forced by sheer weight of speculative movements to float their
currencies.
As a result, interest rates, which had been held at extraordinary heights in
the heat of the battle against devaluation, have tumbled in Sweden, Finland
and Norway. The key marginal rate in Sweden has dropped from 12.5 per cent
at the time of the flotation in November, to 8.75 per cent in early June. In
Denmark, too, interest rates have fallen back closer to German rates since
the May referendum following the removal of uncertainty over the country's
commitment to the EC.
With inflation well below 5 per cent in all four countries, the fall in
interest rates has significantly eased conditions for the banks in their
battle to contain loan losses and to build new, secure lending business.
For the longer term, the governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden have
applied to join the EC and aim to do so in 1995. The strategy is broadly
welcomed by the financial and business communities in the region. But
opinion polls show strong public opposition, especially in Norway. With
referendums due on the issue in each country over the next 18 months, any
sign that membership may be rejected will inject an unwelcome element of
uncertainty into their economies, just as they should be consolidating a
gradual recovery.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (2): Back to the
private sector - Aftermath of the banking crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR NORDIC governments struggling with the aftermath of the banking sector
crisis, the chief immediate issues remain those of restructuring and
restoring profitability. But already Sweden and Norway have made the first
moves towards reprivatising banks that have been taken over in the past two
years.
With the exception of Denmark, where state aid has not been required,
nationalisation has been an inevitable consequence of government commitments
to prevent any defaults in their banking systems and to maintain creditor
confidence, not least among international investors.
The extent of state intervention in the individual countries and the
prospects for reprivatisation are as follows:
SWEDEN: To date, the government has put up SKr74bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in cash,
loans and guarantees to keep banks afloat. It has set up the Bank Support
Authority to administer state support and, where necessary, to acquire and
administer bank shares. The authority will dispose of the shares 'when it is
commercially appropriate'.
So far, the state has taken over Nordbanken and Gotabanken. It is still
reviewing the extent of state aid required by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
the country's leading commercial bank, Swedbank, a newly-created
conglomerate of savings banks known locally as Sparbanken, and
Foreningsbanken, a co-operative bank. Decisions on these are not expected
until the autumn.
Meanwhile, the process of reprivatisation is under way at Gotabanken, which
so far has received SKr10bn in state guarantees, most of which has been
drawn down. A memo to investors was circulated in April to around 20
potential foreign and domestic investors, according to the government. The
bank, which showed operating losses of SKr2.4bn in 1992, could be sold by
early next year.
Before then, a decision will be taken on how much of Gotabanken's portfolio
of SKr40bn of problem loans will be taken out and placed in a so-called 'bad
bank' which will remain under government control. Decisions will also be
made on whether to split up the remainder of the bank, or to sell it in one
piece.
The authority has already dumped bad loans worth SKr67bn out of Nordbanken
into state-run Securum, a 'bad bank' whose assets will gradually be
liquidated. This enabled Nordbanken to show a profit in the first quarter,
after losses in 1992 of SKr16bn. But Nordbanken, which has swallowed SKr56bn
in state support, is not set to be sold off until 1994 at the earliest to
allow time for it to re-establish its long-term stability.
NORWAY: State support for the banks has cost NKr27bn (Pounds 2.6bn) to date
in what has been a virtual nationalisation of the system. The biggest bank,
Den norske Bank, is 70 per cent owned by the government; Christiania Bank
and Fokus Bank, the second and third biggest banks, are all but 100 per cent
state-owned. A smaller commercial bank, Oslobanken, is in the process of
being wound up by the government.
The state's involvement is administered mainly through two institutions, the
Bank Insurance Fund and the Bank Investment Fund, run through the Bank of
Norway. The latter is the main instrument for the exercise of the state's
share ownership (although, confusingly, Fokus Bank is owned by the insurance
fund). The former has provided aid in the form of cash, loans and
guarantees.
The Labour government has said it intends to launch a limited offer of
shares in Christiania Bank later this year to test the market for
reprivatisation following improved performance this year both in the banks
and in the economy as a whole. But its long-term policy on privatisation is
vague. Central bank and commercial bank officials believe that Labour
intends holding on to strategic bank shareholdings, at least to block
foreign takeovers.
FINLAND: The state has so far spent FM38bn (Pounds 4.5bn) on bailing out the
country's banks. A government estimate at the end of 1992 predicted that
another FM30bn would be required before the crisis is resolved, although
parliament has so far only approved an additional FM20bn.
The Government Guarantee Fund, set up to handle the bank crisis, has taken
over the two main players in the savings bank sector, Skopbank and the
Savings Bank of Finland. The state has also extended support at least in the
form of preferred capital to all the banks, including
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading commercial bank.
After a number of aborted attempts to force mergers to rationalise the
system, the government has now commissioned Merrill Lynch of the US to
recommend a course of action for rationalisation and eventual privatisation.
But this is not expected until the autumn and officials say it is too early
to say how long it will be before the state bank shareholdings can be sold
off.

Kevan Hunt, 55, director of employee relations at British Coal, is taking
over as chairman of British Coal Enterprise, the arm of the industry charged
with creating new employment opportunities in former mining areas.
Hunt, a member of the British Coal board, will replace John Northard, who is
retiring after 50 years in the coal industry.  Hunt was a founding director
of BCE in 1984 when it was launched to help staff cope with the shrinking
market for coal.  In the last nine years it claims to have created 80,000
jobs.  Another of its roles is to help former employees seek work outside
the industry.  Hunt said that BCE would be investing Pounds 50m in coalfield
areas in the coming year.

Lord White, the 70-year-old chairman of Hanson Industries, is giving up his
only major board appointment in Britain. He is retiring as a non-executive
director of British Airways after the company's annual meeting on July 13.
His decision not to stand for re-election is another sign of the changing
face of the BA boardroom following Sir Colin Marshall's accession to the
chairmanship earlier this year. Lord White was recruited to the BA board at
the end of 1989 by his old friend, Lord King, who led the airline for 12
years.
At the time of Lord White's appointment, BA had become embroiled in a
controversial bid to win control of United Airlines at the height of the
management buy-out boom on Wall Street. It was felt that the recruitment of
Lord White, a renowned corporate predator, would help prevent BA from making
a fool of itself by over-paying for acquisitions. However, his presence on
the BA board also led to accusations that Lord King was surrounding himself
with old friends.
Sir Colin Marshall has already recruited two new non-execs, Detta O'Cathain
and Charles Mackay and more non-exec appointments are expected as the old BA
guard retire. Sir Francis Kennedy, the former diplomat who was Lord King's
special adviser, is 67 and has been on the board since 1987, while Calor
chairman Michael Davies has been on the board for a decade.

FT  21 JUN 93 / People: Birrell's first brick for retirement home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James Birrell, who steps down as chief executive of the Halifax Building
Society in August, has picked up his first retirement job. He is crossing
the regulatory fence to become a part-time member of the Building Societies
Commission at the start of next year.
It would be highly unusual for a retiring chief executive of a major
clearing bank to join the court of The Bank of England, which supervises the
banks, but The Building Societies Commission, does not appear to suffer the
same sort of inhibitions about possible conflicts of interest.
The BSC, established in 1986, is responsible for supervising the industry.
It meets every three weeks and reviews each society's activities fully at
least once a year.
Although Birrell will be the first Halifax man to join the BSC, until
recently the majority of its part time members were drawn from the building
society movement. Apart from Birrell, chief executive of Britain's biggest
building society, the other members are: Herbert Walden, former chief
executive of Heart of England Building Society, Jock Worsley, a former
president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Graham Sunderland,
former chief executive of Yorkshire Bank, and Nigel Fox Bassett, retired
senior partner of Clifford Chance.
Sir James, who has just been knighted, has been chief executive of the
Halifax Building Society for the last five years, having first joined the
Halifax in 1968 as accountant.

A disused railway warehouse (pictured above) in the heart of Liverpool is to
become a national centre for museum conservation.
The Pounds 5.3m contract to convert the former Midland Goods Depot in
Victoria Street, Liverpool, has been awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION by the
National Museums &amp; Galleries on Merseyside (NMGM).
There will be studios, workshops and laboratories where experts can restore
valuable paintings, statues, sculptures, furniture and fabrics as well as
industrial, maritime and historical artefacts.
The scheme involves complete refurbishment of the Grade II listed building,
a three-storey rail freight warehouse built in 1874 which has lain
semi-derelict for several years.
Total cost of the project is expected to be Pounds 7.2m with a grant of
Pounds 2.2m from the government's City Challenge initiative and another
Pounds 3.5m from the Department of National Heritage. The centre is
scheduled to open in 1995 and a public exhibition area will open the
following year.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: Having the right stuff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British managers no doubt hope they will soon be able to tuck their
recession strategies into the bottom drawer. But there is always something
to learn from those which have best weathered tough times.
OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has surveyed the 250
UK companies with the biggest turnover and come up with a 25-strong league
table of 'recession busters'.
Based on profit growth in the period 1990-93, the list is headed by the
travel group Airtours (whose average annual profits increased by 141 per
cent during the three years in question), followed by security systems and
banknote printer De La Rue (33 per cent) and the north of England
supermarket chain Wm Morrisons (29 per cent).
Being in a so-called 'recession proof' sector obviously helps, which is why
food retailers and wholesalers account for six of the 25 places.
Other traditionally resilient sectors such as the food and drink sector,
manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications are also well
represented with nine constituents between them.
In general OC&amp;C says the successful companies have adopted one of three
strategies:
Aggressively pursuing and well executing, acquisitions. Tomkins, for
example, is in sixth place with 25 per cent profits growth.
Moving quickly to capitalise on the woes of competitors. Airtours, which
benefited from ILG's collapse and recently tried to outmanoeuvre Owners
Abroad, started the recession with a low cost base and has targeted
profitable business rather than merely seeking volume share.
Dominating sectors. Besides De La Rue, Weir Group (8th with a 20 per cent
profits improvement) and Rentokil (4th and 28 per cent) are cited in this
regard.
OC&amp;C partner Chris Outram claims that the study 'shows that it is possible
for companies to outrun a low-growth economy.
'Low growth and even recession are not necessarily excuses for reduced
profits.'

FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: Put in the picture - Training videos are popular
but are they of any value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Cleese is lying in bed with his wife. He is reading a report, she is
sulking behind a glossy magazine. She asks him why he cannot confine his
work to the office. He replies that he is too busy going to meetings - it is
only when he leaves the office that he can start work.
There is something odd about the situation: Cleese looks familiar enough,
but out of his mouth comes the voice of a Chinese actor speaking in
Cantonese.
This image of Cleese as the harassed British manager in his pyjamas has been
travelling the world since 1976. The video, Meetings Bloody Meetings, is one
of the best-used training tools ever, translated into 17 languages watched
by more than 1m managers. It has been so popular that a new version has just
been released for the 1990s without the sideburns and flared trousers.
When the video was first made most managers did not believe they needed
training, and videos were still a rarity. Now Video Arts, the company
started 20 years ago by Cleese and Sir Anthony Jay, co-author of the
television series Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister, finds itself
dominating a sprawling international market. These days all self-respecting
managers go on training courses, and no course is complete without a video.
The British manager may not be universally admired for his performance, yet
when it comes to videos telling managers how to behave, Britain leads the
world. It is only in Japan that the idea has not caught on: Japanese
managers are not amused by the sight of Dawn French, the comedienne, getting
buried under a mountain of memos.
But how worthwhile are these videos? And can a 30-minute one really be worth
the Pounds 1,000 that they can cost to buy?
Research in the US claims that a message learnt through video is 40 per cent
more likely to be retained than one taught through chalk and talk. Videos
appeal to companies because they help break up a training session, and may
get the point across more quickly. 'Video has vast potential for training. I
have a library of videos I use all the time,' says Lucy Gardiner of
Skilltrain, which provides companies with customised training packages.
Comedy has also proved its worth: 'People often go into courses feeling
resentful,' says Tina Tietjen, Video Arts' joint managing director. 'Humour
breaks down fears and helps people relax. Only when they are relaxed can
they take on messages.'
To help relax the audience Video Arts has hired the great and the good of
British comedy, including French and Griff Rhys Jones. Yet according to
Gardiner these big names may be an unnecessary luxury: 'You can have the
same impact without them. In fact, big names can be a distraction.'
Other companies such as Melrose and Longman Training have followed Video
Arts' lead, offering a bewildering choice of comedy, drama, straight
speeches and even interactive videos to teach everything from how to talk on
the phone to the in's and out's of total quality management.
Until recently these three companies carved up much of the market between
them, with video prices that raised some eyebrows. 'It is nice work, if you
can get it,' says Chris Page of Jumpcut, a small Yorkshire-based training
company. Jumpcut's videos for job seekers are sold for as little as Pounds
30 to schools and other customers who would regard prices even as high as
Pounds 100 as a joke.
The established players point to high production costs - Video Arts says it
spends up to Pounds 250,000 per video - and to the quality of their
products. Longman's latest offering on selling financial services is a slick
drama filmed in a stately home, which could lull viewers into thinking they
were watching a high-budget television soap.
Companies have been prepared to pay high prices for videos as the cost of
the video is a small part of the total training cost. Tietjen argues that
the main cost is in lost management time, and that if you can get a point
across through a video it has paid for itself many times over.
These high prices have recently brought new players into the game. For about
half the price the BBC has started to sell videos on such subjects as
presentation skills. Cheaper still is Taylor Made Films which is producing
videos under the Sunday Times name on quality management, personal skills
and leadership. The company claims it offers twice as much material as Video
Arts (two videos instead of one) at a quarter of the price.
But which is best? One of the Sunday Times' new offerings is about meetings,
and is in direct competition with Video Arts' more costly bestseller. Both
videos present a parody of a meeting going badly and then spell out simple
rules for a more successful one. Both offer the same sensible advice:
meetings should not be held unless they are necessary; they should be
planned in advance; everyone should know why they are there; the chairman
should politely shut up people who ramble; decisions should be summarised,
and so on.
However, the Video Arts offering is funny. Cleese is memorable as he stands
in his pyjamas in the dock charged with 'cold-blooded time wasting' by a
stern judge.
The Sunday Times version is unconvincing and cliche ridden - a pretty blond
woman exchanges flirtatious smiles with a wet young manager as she helps him
become more assertive in the chair. The second part of the Sunday Times
offer is in the style of a television documentary. The newspaper's editor,
Andrew Neil, chairs a panel of meetings experts and Peter Hobday, the
broadcaster, interviews company executives about what sort of rooms they
like to hold their meetings in. The result is bland, and will only be
informative to those who can keep their minds on it.
If managers take note of any of the tips in either of the videos their
investment will not be in vain. A recent survey of US executives showed that
a third of all time spent in meetings is wasted. If they spend a little more
time a lot less pleasurably watching the Sunday Times version, at least they
can comfort themselves that they have saved several hundred pounds in doing
so.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: The danger of competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most people will be surprised to learn that one reason for Britain's lack of
competitiveness is an 'over-emphasis on competition' on the part of UK
industry.
This startling assertion is made today in a lengthy academic research
programme on British industrial competitiveness which was funded by the
Economic and Social Research Council, a government body.
More predictably, the study also concludes that companies must not just
focus on improving their strategies, but should also pay greater attention
to changing the 'social institutions' within their organisations.
The curious-looking allegation about competition is contained in the ESRC's
latest 'Innovation Update', entitled Regenerating British Industry - An
Agenda for Management*.
Together with the US, it argues, Britain has developed a view that commerce
is all about individual companies 'battling it out with each other'.
However, in the market-place of the real world, trade is between
interdependent companies, it continues. Companies must remain competitive in
order to win individual deals, but they also depend on collaboration with
'networks' of other companies.
Coming at a time when most companies - including those in Britain - are
involved in at least one strategic alliance, joint venture or 'supplier
network', the ESRC warning looks decidedly academic, in the pejorative sense
of the word.
Given the equally rampant fashion for organisational 'culture change'
throughout industry, the same seems true at first sight of the clarion call
for managements to shift their reformist efforts away from strategies and
structures on to the 'norms and values' of individuals and groups.
Yet the reality is that many British companies are still operating with
early 20th century attitudes and procedures, claims Arthur Francis of
Glasgow University Business School, who co-ordinated the ESRC research
programme.
He cites the (anonymous) example of a large, well-known engineering group
where communication between design and production engineers 'is still done
by letter', and where 'graduate engineers with late 20th-century skills are
still treated mechanistically, like draftsmen'.
Compared with their foreign rivals, far too many British companies give
their technical professionals an inadequate role, says Francis.
'It (British industry) is locked into organisational structures which
developed when industry was craft-based. That way of working was fine in the
1920s, but is certainly not today.'
Such organisational arrangements, says the ESRC 'update', make it hard for
companies to move away from what it calls the 'American System paradigm' of
high volume and low price, towards the 'New Competition' model of delivering
variety, quality and 'fashion' at low cost.
To achieve this, the ESRC document stresses that companies must adopt an
innovative approach to their organisation, rebalancing the power of
different specialist functions, and creating new communication links between
them. They must also give everyone involved a greater sense of ownership of
the product or service which they are producing.
'It is hard enough for an individual to change his or her norms and values,
even when highly motivated,' says the 'update'. 'How much harder it is for a
manager to persuade others to change in this way.' Institutional change
takes time, it adds - typically 10 years.
If much of this seems like modern motherhood to many managers, Francis'
research shows that it is by no means second nature to everyone.
But his appeal seems also to be directed at his fellow academics and their
funding bodies, notably the ESRC: to abandon their traditionally rationalist
obsession with research into 'hard' strategy and structure, and to switch
instead to the much 'softer' areas of creativity and organisational change.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (10): The luxury of
saying No / Profile of Den Danske Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORDS could serve as a motto for any prudent bank: 'I believe one must
allow oneself the luxury of saying No, and it is a luxury we hope to be able
to afford in the years to come as well.' They were spoken by Mr Knud
Sorensen, chief executive of Den Danske Bank, and the bank's record for
prudence has paid off. It has emerged as by far the largest and strongest of
the Danish banks, writes Hilary Barnes.
'We have a good reputation as a serious bank, and the word 'serious' is one
we want associated with our name,' says Mr Sorensen. 'We like to think that
we do not need to be the forerunners in every respect. We want to be the
forerunners in our daily business, of course, but we do not have to be first
with every new creation.
'But we do not jump onto every bandwagon that comes rushing past,' he says.
The bank made a DKr1.73bn loss in 1992 compared with a DKr1.33bn profit in
1991. Provisions rose last year to a record DKr2.94bn, but the capital
adequacy ratio was 11 per cent.
If the bank has come through the credit and property boom-and-bust of the
1980s better than many of its competitors, part of the reason is that it
took a cautious line on some of the more speculative business of the time,
says Mr Sorensen. The prudential approach is part of the bank's life-blood,
since a crash in the 1920s, which brought down Danske's predecessor bank.
'There is nothing to be ashamed of in this inheritance  .. It means that we
think twice,' he says.
But the bank is not risk-averse, he says, rejecting criticism, widespread in
Denmark as elsewhere, that the troubles of the past few years have made the
banks over-cautious. 'In principle our willingness to take risks has not
changed over the past 10 years,' he says, pointing out that the switch from
high to low inflation (in Denmark over the past 12 months it was just over 1
per cent) has a price. Inflation can no longer be counted on to take care of
a bank's losses.
'You have to be more cautious. With a low inflation scenario you have got to
be pretty sure you get it right first time, so we have to examine projects
with greater thoroughness than 10 years ago.' Danske showed its strength
last winter when it staged a two-stage multi-billion kroner
support-cum-rescue operation for Baltica Holding, which controlled the
country's largest insurance business.
Danske's intervention led to a radical restructuring of the Baltica group
and has left Danske with a 32 per cent holding in Baltica Insurance. But Mr
Sorensen insists: 'We have no ambition to take over Baltica Insurance.'
He will have no truck with suggestions that Danske has become too big and
powerful a player in the Danish duckpond. 'A market share of about 30 per
cent is not enough to enable us to dominate. And we act responsibly. We are
the market leader, as we are the biggest, but we do not try to exploit this
situation, and that is deliberate.
'It is part of our corporate culture than we wish to be a responsible
citizen, even if this means that some business may pass us by.'
The current year will a better one for the bank than last year, says Mr
Sorensen, but loss provisions will remain high. He admits that the bank's
earnings on its basic business have not been good enough for several years.
Denmark is considerably overbanked and that means that Danske will have to
emphasise control of costs. A factor in this will be the spread of
electronic banking, which is already well-developed in Danish banks.
'A considerable part of our transactions already go through 'untouched by
human hand'. Like it or not, you will see more automatic banking in our
branches, inside the bank or in the wall.
'Costs are driving us, but so are our customers' inclinations. The younger
generation are brought up with the use of electronic data processing so it
is perfectly natural for them to wish to use it.
'Automats are no replacement for personal contact ... But in future you will
go to the bank more rarely, and it will be for a deep discussion of a
problem, about buying a house or a car or about the family budget,' he says.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (8): Insurers rocked to
the core - Misjudgments have led to losses in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORDIC insurance industry faces a period of consolidation and recovery
after being rocked to its core by the dramatic events of the past three
years, which have caused enormous losses to creditors and shareholders and
serious damage to the industry's international reputation.
Paradoxically, however, the outstanding dramas of the past year, the
collapse of UNI Storebrand in Norway and Hafnia and Baltica in Denmark, had
less to do with the business of insurance than serious misjudgments by the
over-ambitious managements of the holding companies of the three groups.
Similarly, Sweden's Trygg-Hansa SPP suffered heavy losses as a result of a
large investment in Gotabanken just before the bank collapsed. But the
insurance companies themselves, leaving aside the results of the holding
companies, have suffered from the recession, the state of financial and
property markets and collapse of the banking sector.
Investment income has been slashed and there have been heavy losses on
credit risk insurance, especially in Sweden. In addition, losses on
international reinsurance business have been so big that the companies are
cutting back drastically on reinsurance commitments. Of the six largest
insurers in the Nordic region, Trygg-Hansa SPP and Skandia in Sweden, UNI-S
and Gjensidige in Norway, Pohjola and Sampo in Finland, and Baltica and
Hafnia in Denmark, only one, Gjensidige, made a profit last year.
But the first months of 1993 have brought signs of a recovery. With interest
rates falling and bond and equity markets strengthening, the insurance
companies face a better year. And, of course, things are looking up, now
that the mess left by the UNI-S and Hafnia raid on Skandia has been sorted
out.
The 43 per cent of the shares in Skandia held by UNI-S and Hafnia were sold
this month to European institutional investors, which means that Skandia's
ownership problems are settled and the management can concentrate on
restoring the group to profit.
Hafnia's insurance companies have been taken over by Codan, the Danish
company controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, which has become Denmark's
largest insurer with about 18 per cent of the accident market and 12 per
cent of life assurance business. Hafnia Holding, meanwhile, has gone into
bankruptcy.
UNI-S is in the process of a financial reconstruction which will put the
group, which made a profit in the first quarter, back on its feet.
Baltica's and Hafnia's fates were linked. Hafnia tried to gain control of
Baltica in 1990-91, buying 34 per cent of Baltica Holding before mounting
the raid on Skandia. The collapse of Baltica's share price, at the same time
as the value of Hafnia's 15 per cent holding in Skandia collapsed, wiped out
Hafnia Holding's equity capital in August 1992.
By acquiring 34 per cent of Baltica Holding, Hafnia could block decisions by
Baltica's shareholders, so that when Baltica acquired the state's pensions
and life assurance group, Statsanstalten, in 1991, it had to finance the
DKr4bn deal with bank loans, not by raising new equity capital. Borrowing
short to finance long-term investments subjected Baltica to an unsustainable
liquidity squeeze.
But, in the end, Baltica Holding was brought down by losses by its banking
arm, Baltica Finance; by injudicious investments in office and residential
property investments in Gibraltar; and by involvement in Scanexco, a Danish
property investment project.
Baltica Holding was reconstructed in March in a rescue masterminded by Den
Danske Bank. Its stake in Baltica Insurance was reduced to 26 per cent, and
the holding company's name changed to Gefion.
The ownership of Baltica Insurance has yet to be finally resolved.
Currently, Den Danske Bank owns 32 per cent, while Baltica Insurance owns 27
per cent of its own shares. Both these stakes must be sold to other owners
within two or three years.
The motive for the UNI-S-Hafnia raid on Skandia was to establish a
pan-Nordic insurance giant, which, it was said, would prove a bulwark
against any attempt by continental insurers to establish a commanding
presence in the Nordic market. The Nordic insurers (excepting Denmark) have
so far been protected by national restrictions on foreign ownership, but
this protected status is coming to an end with implementation of the
European Economic Area agreement between the EC and the Efta countries.
Unfortunately, the raiders failed to ensure that Mr Bjorn Wollrath,
Skandia's chief general manager, would play ball. The omission was crucial,
as Skandia's voting restrictions in effect leave the company in the control
of its management rather than its shareholders.
'The most tragic aspect of the raid is that for a generation we have lost
the opportunity to form a strong pan-Nordic insurance business,' argues Mr
Eigil Molgaard, director general of the Danish Financial Industry
Supervisory Authority.
He blames the Baltica and Hafnia disasters on the fact that the holding
companies, established in the mid-1980s, expanded into business areas with
which they were unfamiliar and attempted to undertake 'the almost hopeless
task' of rapid expansion in the midst of an economic recession; and on
incompetent management, both at supervisory board and board of director
level and in some staff functions as well.
The collapse of UNI-S and the Danes leaves Skandia again at the centre of
the Nordic stage. Skandia owns Norway's accident insurance company Vesta and
Denmark's KGL Brand. Vesta has a market share in Norway of about 16 per cent
and was profitable last year. KGL Brand's market share is about 5 per cent
and it made a substantial loss.
Skandia has previously discussed co-operation or merger with Baltica. With a
controlling shareholding in Baltica coming onto the market within two or
three years, Skandia may again look at this option. But Mr Wollrath said
recently that in present circumstances Skandia was not interested.
International banks and investors have suffered from the events of the past
year, helping to bring Nordic finance into disrepute. The largest foreign
shareholder in UNI-S is also outraged by the plan to refinance the Norwegian
group, which involves writing down the face value of the shares to NKr10
from NKr20 while giving existing shareholders the right to subscribe to only
half the NKr1.8bn new share issue, with the rest going to Norwegian
institutions.
Mr Leon Genoud, chairman of Zurich's CB Capital Bank, which holds 4.1 per
cent of UNI-S's shares, has described the UNI-S scheme as 'robbery' and
'killing the rights of the present shareholders'. However, if it brings
retrospective comfort to the international financial community, a repetition
of the events leading to the collapse of the Baltica, Hafnia and UNI-S does
not seem likely.
A factor in the developments is that holding companies controlling financial
institutions were not subject to the finance industry's supervisory
authority, although the insurance companies themselves were. That is being
changed. The European Community has already approved a directive giving
powers to banking industry supervisors over holding companies that control
banks or savings banks. The Commission is now working hard on a directive
that will do the same for the insurance sector.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (9): How Denmark is odd
man out - Financial supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the requirements for success as bank industry supervisor, says Mr
Eigil Molgaard, the director for the past six years of the Danish Financial
Supervisory Authority, is 'a hand which does not tremble when when one comes
face to face with some of the most powerful people in the business
community.'
He speaks from experience. Within the past year he has been the person
primarily responsible for the departure of the chief executives and chairmen
of three of Denmark's largest financial service institutions, Unibank,
Hafnia and Baltica.
Foreign bankers who are well acquainted with the Danish scene regularly
emphasise that the standard of supervision exercised by the Danish financial
supervisors is one of the reasons why Denmark has been able to avoid the
dramatic crises which have occurred in Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Mr Molgaard concurs in this assessment. The Danish economy went into
recession in 1987, and has not yet recovered. In the six years since then,
Mr Molgaard's agency has handled financial crises in 107 institutions, of
which 75 have closed 'We have been kept busy without a break,' he says,
'handling new crises at the rate of one and a half a month'.
Mr Molgaard lays down five main criteria for assessing the quality of a
given banking environment:
sound and up-to-date legislation;
an efficient supervisory body, with sufficient resources;
a generous and high-quality capital base;
provisions policy which provides the banks with large reserves against which
losses can be written off; and
satisfactory and stable earnings from primary banking operations.
Measured against these criteria, Mr Molgaard says, the Danish banks
themselves, as well as the supervisory authority, operate under satisfactory
legislation. A factor in ensuring that the legislative position has remained
satisfactory, he says, is the country's membership of the European Community
since 1973, forcing Denmark to keep up with EC requirements and providing it
with laws which meet the needs of the time.
EC membership also exposed the Danish banks to international competition
early on. 'Being geared to competition in a larger banking environment has
given us strength,' he says.
The capital base of the Danish banks is one of the most important reasons
why the Danish industry has avoided the serious problems that have affected
banks elsewhere in Scandinavia, despite provisions averaging about 2 per
cent of loans and guarantees in 1990 and 1991, and rising to 2.6 per cent in
1992.
As a result partly of 1930's banking law and partly the supervisory
authority's practice over a long period, the average capital adequacy of the
Danish banks was 14 per cent in 1990, when the ratio was recalculated on the
basis of the so-called Basle rules, which set an international minimum ratio
of 8 per cent. The Danish legal minimum ratio was set at 10 per cent in
1990, but came down to 9 per cent this year and will fall to 8 per cent in
1995. Mr Molgaard personally thinks that it would be just as well if the
Danish ratio was fixed at a higher level than the international minimum
ratio.
The Danish supervisors' approach to provisions is closely connected with
their long-standing policy of visiting every bank and savings bank, large as
well as small, at regular intervals to assess the quality of each bank's
assets. This gives the supervisors an intimate knowledge of the banks, their
customers, prospects, management and culture. 'We can see a potential
problem before the banks themselves can,' he says.
The supervisors will often call on the banks to make larger provisions than
the banks think necessary, which does not make the supervisors popular. 'But
if a bank does not follow our instructions, it costs, because we force them
to follow up, and it affects the bank's profits.' There are several former
bank chief executives who rue the day that they failed to take the
supervisors' advice at face value.
