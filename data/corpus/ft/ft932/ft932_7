FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (7): Time may be right
for freedom - Karen Fossli sees signs of recovery among Norway's commercial
banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S ailing commercial bank sector has at last begun to show signs of
recovery, to judge by this year's first-quarter results. The improvement has
persuaded the government that the time may be right to embark on a
reprivatisation programme. The first target next year is likely to be the
Christiania Bank (CBK), the country's second biggest, in which the state
owns about 98.8 per cent of the share capital.
The state also controls about 70 per cent of the share capital of Den norske
Bank, the country's biggest commercial bank, while Fokus Bank, the third
biggest commercial bank, is wholly state-owned. More than NKr27bn has been
pumped into the bank sector over the past five years through state-backed
bank guarantee and investment funds and by the banks' own guarantee funds.
Financial deregulation is at the heart of the banking crisis. It fuelled
competition but led to less-than-prudent domestic and foreign expansion.
After Norway's oil-dependent economy plunged into recession in 1986 world
crude oil prices fell to below Dollars 6 a barrel. This culminated in the
banks' collapse nearly two years ago
According to London-based Davis International Banking Consultants, appointed
by the government earlier this year to study capacity in the domestic
banking sector, annual lending growth by commercial and savings banks -
which had been running at about 15 per cent in the early 1980s - shot up to
about 30 per cent between 1984 and 1988.
Between 1980 and 1989 the commercial banks' loan-deposit ratio to non-bank
sectors nearly doubled from 86 to more than 150 per cent, making them
dangerously dependent on wholesale and international deposits. The ratio
fell to about 122 per cent by the end of 1992 and to 116 per cent in this
year's first quarter.
For the savings banks, the non-bank loan/liability ratio rose from 72 to 117
per cent before declining to 111 per cent by the end of last year. In the
first quarter of this year, there was a 2.5 per cent rise in the loan volume
of the savings banks, at the expense of the commercial banks.
The biggest savings bank, Sparebanken Nor, which is also the third biggest
bank in Norway, is moving aggressively to boost its share of the corporate
lending market. DIBC estimates these four banks have a total of 100,000
corporate clients, about 40 per cent of the 240,000 companies in Norway.
Households contribute 75 per cent of funds available to financial
institutions and account for 60 per cent of overall loans. The commercial
banks have only about 30 per cent of retail deposits (compared with 60 per
cent of corporate deposits) and 25 per cent of retail loans.
With the onset of recession the banks found themselves holding bulging,
non-performing loan portfolios. To make matters worse property, which serves
as collateral for loans, plunged in value by an estimated 30 per cent.
There are recent signs that property values have bottomed out and may even
be on the upturn in some parts of Norway. Credit losses were more than
halved to NKr8.7bn last year from a peak of NKr22bn in 1991.
In the first quarter of 1993 CBK returned a net profit of NKr209m, against a
loss of NKr86m in the same period last year while DnB cut net losses to
NKr138m from NKr601m. Fokus Bank achieved a first quarter net profit of
NKr36.7m, against a net loss of NKr137.6m.
The improvement was due primarily to gains in shares and bonds, and to
foreign currency gains. The banks were also granted subsidised loans by the
central bank and ordered by the state to reduce their balance sheets and cut
costs. They were helped by 12 cuts in the central bank's key overnight
lending rate, currently 7.5 per cent.
DIBC believes that by the end of this year Norway will have the lowest
branch density among its Nordic peers and the lowest number of bank staff
per inhabitants. The Association of Bank Employees estimates that some
10,000 jobs in the sector have been lost in the past five years, but that
may not be the end. Both CBK and DnB warn that the high level of
non-performing loans makes it far too early to call an end to the six-year
banking crisis. There is growing concern about declining loan volume owing
to a prolonged lack of corporate interest in investing in Norway.
As the commercial banks struggle to regain profitability - there is a target
return on equity of 15 to 20 per cent - they are meeting increasing
competition from the savings banks and mortgage companies which have been
transformed into banks.
They can take some comfort from DIBC's prediction that when the European
Economic Area is implemented later this year - to give banks from other
European Free Trade Association countries and the European Community the
right to open branches in Norway - there will be no immediate impact on the
retail market. In fact, foreign banks have shown little interest in
expanding to Norway and recently a couple of foreign banks closed up shop.
However, DIBC forecasts that with little or no net growth in revenue, it
will be necessary to make continuing cuts in branch and staff numbers to pay
salary increases and achieve adequate levels of profits. 'The capacity
needed for retail banking is likely to decrease by 2-3 per cent per annum
for the foreseeable future,' it says.
DIBC warns that the authorities could damage the banking system - and
therefore the economy as a whole - by insisting on substantial cuts in
capacity, particularly at commercial banks, as a short-term response to the
banking crisis. 'Such a knee-jerk reaction may not be justified in relation
to the banks' long-term prospects.'
In Tokyo earlier this year, Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, told
Japanese bankers that structural adjustments would be necessary to
strengthen the financial sector. 'In our view there is still excess capacity
in the banking sector,' he said. Later this year, Mr Johnsen is due to
announce measures to curb capacity.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (6): Bank will test the
market - CBK set for gradual reprivatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S finance ministry intends to float a limited number of shares in
Christiania Bank (CBK) in the autumn.
The object of the exercise is to test the market to establish an indicative
price level for CBK's shares ahead of gradual reprivatisation from 1994 when
a limited number of shares are expected to be listed on the Oslo bourse.
CBK's share capital has been wiped out by heavy losses - last year it had a
negative return on equity of 98.3 per cent and a negative net return on
assets of 1.1 per cent.
As a result, the state was forced to recapitalise the bank with NKr1.9bn in
core capital - of which NKr1bn was new share capital and NKr900m a
subordinated convertible loan.
In 1991, the state pumped NKr6.94bn into CBK while the guarantee fund of the
commercial banks injected NKr920m. However, senior CBK executives have
warned the government not to proceed with plans for reprivatisation without
first spelling out its long-term strategy for state ownership of the banks.
Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, has stated publicly that the state
intends to remain a long-term owner of the banks - and that he is planning
further capacity cuts in the bank sector.
'We would like to stress it would be a big advantage, if not a necessity,
for the government to make clear what it intends to do with its stake in the
banks before it starts selling off shares,' senior CBK executives said
recently.
Improved first-quarter results, lower interest rates and a surge in demand
for the few remaining bank shares traded on the Oslo bourse and in CBK's
limited number of privately-held shares have encouraged the government to
move on reprivatisation.
On the Oslo bourse, the bank sub-index this year until the first week of
June had increased by 88.84 per cent. By comparison, in the first quarter
this year Oslo's all-share index rose by 20 per cent, while CBK's portfolio
of listed shares increased in value by 24 per cent. But CBK bank executives
believe reprivatisation may be premature and that the minority Labour
government does not intend fully to relinquish control of the banks - and
that this should be made clear to investors.
UK-based Davis International Banking Consultants said in a study of
Norwegian bank capacity: 'We believe that any future investors in Norwegian
banks are going to demand a considerable cushion of surplus equity in order
to protect them against unforeseen risks.'
CBK's shareholders, like those of Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, were
forced to accept that a big portion of the bank's share capital had been
wiped out and that the value of their shares had been written down to zero.
This was despite CBK's efforts to win government support for maintaining a
symbolic value of the shares. CBK says it now faces the twin tasks of
boosting new loan volume while reducing the volume of non-performing loans.
'We need good loans to enhance growth and we need to reduce non-performing
loans,' senior executives say.
The bank has been through a big consolidation process: in the past two years
it has reduced staff by 20 per cent and in this year's first quarter it cut
another 147 jobs.
Learning bitter lessons from its past mistakes, CBK has established a credit
control committee to approve all loans above NKr40m while all loans of more
than NKr10m must be reported to it. Last year, the control committee
reviewed 1,000 loan applications above the NKr40m level.
By the first quarter of this year, CBK's portfolio of gross non-performing
loans was NKr11.588bn for which loan loss provisions of NKr5.879bn have been
made. CBK also reckons it has a loans worth NKr4.88bn with high-risk
exposure. In all, the bank has net loans of NKr70.849bn.
On the bright side, in this year's first quarter, net non-performing loans
reached their lowest level in three years, at NKr5.7bn.
CBK says it faces potentially high losses from loans to the fishing sector
which account for NKr8bn of the loan portfolio. It has loans of NKr3.2-3.5bn
to fishing companies in Seattle which are struggling to make ends meet after
the fishing season was halved to about 100 days a year. In the first quarter
of this year the bank charged accounts with a NKr99m loss on loans to
fishermen in the area.
Meanwhile, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Den norske Bank's chief executive, says DnB
can also be reprivatised next year if the bank manages to bounce back to the
black in 1993. He says profitability is within reach and that DnB is likely
to follow a corresponding schedule to that of Christiania Bank, in which
state-owned shares will be offered this year, followed by a rights issue of
new shares in 1994.
Mr Hvistendahl believes the government would not subscribe to the new shares
of either CBK or DnB, thereby reducing its stake in the two banks to below
50 per cent.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (5): New broom tackles
losses - S-E-Banken's president talks to Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE handsome but somewhat staid head office of Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, close to Stockholm's waterfront, Mr Bjorn Svedberg, its president
and chief executive, wears an appropriately stern expression when discussing
the catastrophic losses incurred last year by Sweden's leading commercial
bank.
He sticks firmly to the line he has held, ever since the bank's relatively
encouraging first quarter results, that it is too early to say that
S-E-Banken is out of the woods. He will not comment, in the midst of highly
sensitive negotiations, on the extent of state aid he is seeking under the
bank's application for government support filed last February.
But he will allow this comment: 'The earnings capacity of the bank is pretty
good. The dominant problem is the credit losses. Once we get out of the
credit losses, I see us developing as a healthy bank.'
The big question is how S-E-Banken will extract itself from its gargantuan
loan losses, and how long it will take. Last year, the bank plunged to a
SKr5.4bn (about Pounds 500m) operating loss after lending losses - mainly
tied to the collapsing property sector - of SKr11bn. The total portfolio of
non-performing loans spiralled to almost SKr29bn, or 8 per cent of all
outstanding loans.
Faced with the threat of falling below the internationally-decreed capital
adequacy ratio of 8 per cent, S-E-Banken applied for state support. The
government responded favourably, saying it would keep the bank solvent.
But no conclusion has yet been reached on how much - if any - direct aid the
bank requires. Last week the two sides issued a joint statement saying the
first step towards recapitalising S-E-Banken should be a call on its
shareholders, via a share issue yet to be detailed. A decision on state
support was put off until the autumn.
The negotiations have been complicated by signs of improvement in
S-E-Banken's plight. In the first quarter, its operating loss was cut by 55
per cent as interest earnings rose sharply and the portfolio of
non-performing loans shrank slightly. Falling interest rates have come as a
welcome fillip and stock market speculation that the worst is over has sent
S-E-Banken's share price racing upwards from a low of around SKr7 in April
to almost SKr40.
As Mr Svedberg pointedly remarks, S-E-Banken has not fallen below the
capital adequacy 'red line'. But equally pointedly, the bank has not
withdrawn its application for aid. Clearly, with loan losses set to pin the
bank in deficit again this year and perhaps even 1994, S-E-Banken would like
some latitude to help it deal with its bad assets. The government has set a
precedent in its assumption of tens of billions of kroner of bad loans held
by state-owned Nordbanken and Gotabanken.
Mr Svedberg has some bargaining chips in his hands. The government is
anxious to ensure the banks are not forced by their predicament to squeeze
new credits just as the recession-struck economy is set to resume a slow
growth path. It is under strong pressure politically not to give S-E-Banken
help without getting something in return, such as equity. Yet Mrs Anne
Wibble, the finance minister, does not want the state to deepen its
ownership role in the banking system.
While the negotiations continue, Mr Svedberg must get on with the job of
knocking S-E-Banken back into operational shape. He has the benefit not only
of being untainted by any responsibility for the past disasters, but of
being new to the banking scene altogether.
When the bank's small shareholders vented their anger over the catastrophic
1992 losses at the group's annual meeting in April, understandable criticism
of the board's performance pointedly excluded the decision to bring in Mr
Svedberg last September.
Instead, there was praise for the appointment. Mr Svedberg, 56, was well
known as one of Sweden's most prominent senior managers. An engineer by
qualification, he was at the time of his appointment chairman of Ericsson,
the big telecommunications company where he had previously spent 13 often
turbulent years as chief executive.
But it was not just the small shareholders who liked the new broom. To the
Wallenberg family, which holds some 7 per cent of S-E-Banken and regards it
as a prestigious - if tarnished - jewel in the dynastic crown, Mr Svedberg
was anything but an outsider as the family is a major shareholder in
Ericsson.
One of the chief changes he has instigated has been a structural shake-up of
the bank. It has been streamlined into three main divisions: S-E-Banken, the
retail division, Enskilda Corporate, the corporate and investment division,
and Diligentia, the 'loan hospital' which contains all the group's bad
assets. 'We are trying to be a model bank for the 1990s when I anticipate a
high level of competition in a market which will not expand as it did in the
1980s,' Mr Svedberg says.
'We are decentralising very much, seeing to it that the branch managers are
the people who really coach their people to take care of the customers.' The
emphasis is on achieving a structure 'with very few levels between myself
and the customer'. Words like 'professionalism', 'productivity' and
'quality' come up frequently, echoing Mr Svedberg's industrial background.
Rigorous new credit control systems have also been introduced, with a series
of local, regional and national committees set up to review every lending
decision the bank takes. 'The aim is to have a real second opinion for every
loan in a way that we didn't have before. It is one system all over the
group. It looks at a credit from a more technical and a policy point of
view.'
Sweden's slow return to growth will not offer the banks any 'quick fixes',
Mr Svedberg says, but S-E-Banken, which handles two-thirds of the country's
international payments, hopes to benefit from strong export growth over the
next two years.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Economics: Unemployment exercises EC leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of high and rising unemployment hangs over Europe this week.
While European Community leaders meet in Copenhagen to discuss ways of
reviving the continent's ailing economy, May money supply details from the
Bundesbank, due today or tomorrow, could trigger moves towards lower
interest rates.
Some economists think growth of M3, Germany's broad measure of money supply,
may have slowed sufficiently to come within the Bundesbank's target range of
4.5 to 6.5 per cent seasonally adjusted annualised growth from its 1992
fourth quarter base. If so, the Bundesbank could be more inclined to ease
monetary policy, especially if German cost of living figures this week
indicate a moderation of inflationary pressures.
But most forecasters take a cautious view of likely trends. MMS
International, the financial information company, reports consensus
forecasts of 6.8 per cent for M3 growth in May and an unchanged June annual
inflation rate of 4.2 per cent.
France is expected to report falling industrial production today, adding to
pressure on the government to lower its interest rates.
In the US, durable goods orders for May should be consistent with a moderate
economic recovery.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International.
Today: Denmark, EC summit in Copenhagen. UK, trade with non-EC countries in
May (Pounds 900m deficit). France, April industrial production (down 0.5 per
cent). US, May Treasury budget (Dollars 39.8bn deficit). Canada, first
quarter annualised figures for real GDP (up 3.2 per cent), consumption (up
1.7 per cent), GDP deflator (1.6 per cent), current account (CDollars 27bn
deficit), business investment (up 2.4 per cent), non residential
construction (down 12 per cent),
Tomorrow: Denmark, final day of EC summit. UK, first quarter national
accounts, (final GDP up 0.3 per cent on quarter, 0.7 per cent on year),
balance of payments (current account Pounds 3.7bn deficit).
Wednesday: US, May durable orders (up 1.5 per cent); auto sales June 11 to
20 (6.8m); first quarter final GDP (up 0.9 per cent), GDP deflator (3.3 per
cent). Japan, US trade representative Mickey Kantor addresses US chamber of
commerce in Tokyo. UK, Construction output, new orders for April; first
quarter institutional investment, cross border acquisitions and mergers,
international banking statistics.
Thursday: UK, May new vehicle registrations, April engineering sales and
orders. US, May personal income (up 0.7 per cent), personal consumption
expenditure (up 0.3 per cent); Money supply week ended June 14 (M2 down
Dollars 0.7bn); initial claims week ended June 19 (345,000).
Friday: UK, June CBI monthly industrial trends enquiry; first quarter
capital spending and stockbuilding. Japan, Tokyo June consumer price index
(up 1 per cent on year); national May CPI (up 1 per cent on year). US, May
existing home sales. Canada, industrial goods PPI (flat), raw materials
price index.
During the Week: Germany, M3 from Q4 base (6.8 per cent); March current
account (DM4bn deficit), trade balance (DM1.7bn surplus), regional cost of
living indices for June, national cost of living (up 0.2 per cent on month,
4.2 per cent on year). Italy, April PPI (up 3.6 per cent on year), wholesale
prices (up 5.6 per cent on year); May M2 up 6 per cent on year, May bank
lending (up 5.3 per cent). Denmark, May CPI (up 0.7 per cent on month, 1.1
per cent on year). Belgium, June CPI (up 2.6 per cent on year). Finland, May
trade balance (1.7bn Markka).

FT  21 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead: British Steel results to reflect
overcapacity - Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel's results for the year to the end of March, due to be
announced on Monday, are expected to show pre-tax losses of Pounds 170m
reflecting recession and overcapacity in Europe.
Analysts will be more interested to hear the company's views on whether
further price rises are possible this year. The outlook for talks on
capacity reduction between the EC and state owned steelmakers is also likely
to be raised.
Attention will be focused on whether provisions for bad and doubtful debts
are starting to ease in the UK banks' sector when TSB Group announces
interim results on Thursday. TSB is the first of the banks to report by a
month.
Pre-tax profit for the half year is expected to fall to about Pounds 50m
compared to Pounds 92m the previous year, and bad debt provisions to rise to
around Pounds 240m from Pounds 165m. The bank is expected to maintain its
interim dividend.
The impact of exceptional costs of about Pounds 3m from its photo-processing
business will cloud the picture at London International Group, which reports
annual results on Friday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds
31.5m under FRS 3, compared with last year's figure of Pounds 16.9m, which
was also depressed by restructuring costs of Pounds 22.5m. The ColorCare
photoprocessing business continues to suffer from lack of demand, but the
Durex condom business is growing steadily.
First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions
group, will be quizzed for signs of a recovery in consumer confidence when
it reports interim results on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting a slight
increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.7m to about Pounds 12m in the
six months to May 3, but the group's results are heavily skewed towards the
second half and most attention will surround current market conditions and
the trading outlook.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Barclays breaks ranks on data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the largest UK bank, is to break with tradition among high-street
banks by obtaining data from credit reference agencies about the financial
transactions of applicants for its Barclaycard credit card.
Barclaycard has agreed to supply full information about how some customers
use credit cards to three agencies in exchange for access to data covering
100m accounts. It will use the data to assess customers' and applicants'
creditworthiness.
Barclaycard wants to use information held by the CCN, Equifax and Infolink
agencies to assess applications for credit cards more accurately. It is
particularly interested in seeing the other forms of credit a customer
holds.
The Barclays subsidiary hopes to be able to approve more applications for
cards by using 'white data' on individuals' transactions, in addition to
'black data' on individuals heavily in arrears to which it now has access.
In order to gain access to 'white data' from June next year the bank has
agreed to supply its own similar data about Barclaycard accounts from
customers who have given permission.
It has altered application forms for Barclaycards so that new applicants
have to give permission for data relating to their card use to be forwarded
to credit agencies. This is to comply with the banking code of practice.
The decision to supply and receive 'white data' is the first such move among
large high street banks, which have refused to supply this information to
credit agencies before, citing a duty of confidentiality to their customers.
However, the banks have also lacked the technology to use bulk 'white data'
to score creditworthiness properly. Barclaycard believes it will have the
appropriate technology in place within a year.
Barclaycard is rejecting 46 per cent of the 2,000 applications it receives
every day, a figure that has risen about 10 percentage points in three years
as the company has tried to curtail the amount of bad debt generated on its
cards. It believes it can reduce its rejection rate by using more data on
new applicants.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays' central retail services
division, said the additional information would allow Barclaycard to avoid
'turning down a number of people who would be good customers if we knew
more'.
Although high-street banks have not contributed or received 'white data'
from credit agencies, smaller banks including the Co-operative Bank and
Girobank already supply such data on their credit-card customers in order to
assess risk.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Nuclear power review to take narrow focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S pro-mised review of the nuclear power industry, scheduled
for later this year, is likely to focus on a narrow set of economic issues
rather than broad questions of energy policy.
This is against the wishes of the nuclear industry, which believes a wider
review would be more likely to result in approval for more nuclear power
stations.
The review is crucial to the prospects for nuclear power in the UK. At
present only one nuclear station, Sizewell B, is being built. The review
will decide what happens next.
Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry are still considering the
terms of reference for the review but the indications are they feel that
energy policy received a thorough airing in last winter's coal crisis.
A narrow review would focus on the economics of nuclear power, particularly
the prospects for financing nuclear power stations from the private sector
and, eventually, privatising the state-owned nuclear utilities, Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear.
The nuclear industry fears, however, that such a review might conclude that
nuclear power cannot attract private-sector finance for the next stage of
its development, and that plans for new nuclear power stations should be put
on hold. Nuclear Electric does not expect to make an unsubsidised profit
before 1996. Although Scottish Electric reported a Pounds 66m profit last
week, it is not ready for privatisation.
The economics of nuclear power are also bound up in the controversial issues
of decommissioning costs and waste management which the nuclear industry
would rather avoid. Much will depend on whether the government gives the
go-ahead to the Thorp nuclear waste processing plant at Sellafield.
Nuclear industry executives say they hope the review will take account of
the industry's longer-term prospects.
A larger nuclear industry would help reduce atmospheric emissions at a time
when EC regulations are being tightened, and would strengthen the diversity
of fuel sources. They stress the export prospects for nuclear construction
and decommissioning technology if the UK has a flourishing nuclear power
sector.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Chessmen look for rich takings: How the game is entering the
world of big money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE end of this year there will be at least two rival claimants for the
title of world chess champion. The next few months will see considerable
turmoil, described by Leonard Barden, the FT's chess correspondent, as an
'intellectual Bosnia'.
The upheaval dates back at least to November when two old stars of the chess
world, Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky, played a match in the former
Yugoslavia for a purse of Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m), sponsored by Mr Jezdimir
Vasiljevic, a Yugoslav banker.
The match did not produce sparkling chess but it did bring megabucks to a
game where large purses are unusual. Fischer won and received Dollars 3.35m.
The match did not have the backing of Fide, the world chess federation.
Spassky's international rating was equal 96th and Fischer had been a virtual
recluse for 20 years. If they could command Dollars 5m it seemed that the
coming match between Nigel Short, the first British contender for years
playing in his home country and ranked eighth by Fide, against Garry
Kasparov, the world champion, could force the stakes a little higher.
So Kasparov and Short were disappointed when Fide accepted Manchester's
Pounds 1.2m bid to stage the world championship. They rejected the bid and
set up the Professional Chess Association to rival Fide. They are still the
only professional chess-playing members of the association, which has signed
a deal with The Times newspaper for a purse of Pounds 1.7m  - Pounds 1m to
the winner, Pounds 700,000 to the loser  - for a match of 24 games in London
in September.
Last week Fide responded by stripping both Kasparov and Short of their
rankings. It announced that newly first-ranked Anatoly Karpov  - decisively
beaten by both Short and Kasparov in the last year  - and Jan Timman, ranked
34th, beaten by Short to qualify for his match against Kasparov, would
contest its world championship.
Fide further announced it would put up Pounds 800,000 of the Pounds 1.8m
purse for the Timman-Karpov match, to be staged half in Oman and half in the
Netherlands, starting at the same time as the Short-Kasparov match.
The PCA has announced that it is to hold qualifying matches for its own
world championship, promising a prize fund of Dollars 200,000 and unifying
the men's and women's world titles. Fifty of the world's leading players
will be invited to compete in the Netherlands, in December  - one month
before Fide plans to host its own world championship qualifying round, also
in the Netherlands.
Mr Stewart Reuben, a director of the British Chess Federation, does not
support the PCA, but he reflects a growing view that Fide may have
overplayed its hand by removing its ratings from Kasparov and Short. He
said: 'I regard Fide's action as absolutely disgraceful and perhaps a
restraint of trade, since without Fide ratings who knows how good any
international chess player really is?'
If they make a better living, neither Short nor Kasparov may feel too
unhappy about that. And the marketing industry has got in on the act. Daily
tickets to watch the games at the Savoy Hotel, which can seat about 1,100,
will cost between Pounds 45 and Pounds 150. Telechess World Productions has
worldwide television rights. In the UK, Channel 4 will run 60 hours of the
match.
Fide will survive, and also perhaps the PCA, but chess will never be quite
the same.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Ministers set to act on legal right to silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES TO the law governing the defendant's right to silence in English
criminal cases may come as soon as the next parliamentary session starting
in November.
With the need to restore confidence in the justice system acute after a
series of wrongful convictions, ministers are keen to press ahead and
implement the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice's less controversial and
less costly recommendations without undue delay.
The inclusion of a wide-ranging criminal justice bill in the next session's
legislative programme should give the government an early opportunity to do
this.
The commission  - chaired by Lord Runciman and charged with conducting the
most far-reaching review of the English criminal justice system for a
century  - is set to report in just over two weeks. Though rapid action to
implement the commission's ideas on fraught subjects such as disputed
confessions and the right to trial by jury is unlikely from a government
still smarting from last month's climbdown over means-related fines,
ministers are minded to force the pace where there is more consensus.
One such area is the defendant's right to silence. Another is the question
of miscarriages of justice, where the commission is likely to recommend the
creation of an independent tribunal to take the investigation of suspect
cases out of the hands of the Home Office.
If, as expected, the commission advocates that the defence be required to
disclose its case early in pre-trial proceedings, ministers may act to
incorporate the necessary legislative changes in the new criminal justice
bill.
These would be designed to outlaw the so-called 'ambush defence', where an
accused person remains silent throughout an investigation but offers an
explanation at trial. There would be no question of defendants being forced
to incriminate themselves, however.
The commission's research found that silence may have hampered the
conviction of the guilty in 2 per cent or 3 per cent of cases  - enough,
ministers believe, to make the case for reform a matter of priority.
Moves towards swift implementation of some of the Runciman proposals would
be one way for Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to demonstrate he has
taken a grip on his new department in advance of what will be a busy
legislative session for the Home Office.
Measures to restrict a defendant's right to silence would be an issue on
which the currently fractious Tory party could unite for the next session's
legislative timetable.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Mirror faces Pounds 6m claim for rent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers will be in default by Pounds 6m on the rent of its
London headquarters at the end of this month, as a decision looms on the
group's new location.
Mr Maurice Withall, the receiver to Robert Maxwell Estates, MGN's landlord,
at accountants Grant Thornton, confirmed yesterday that MGN would be
delinquent for the third successive quarter if it did not pay rent at the
end of June.
Robert Maxwell Estates, which was part of the private Maxwell business
empire, is the landlord to the Holborn site in central London, and the
immediate tenant on the property is Maxwell Communication Corporation. But
because MCC is in administration under English insolvency law, Mr Withall
has taken legal action to pursue MGN, the sub-tenant, for payment.
MGN relented after originally refusing to pay rent from the point at which
the Maxwell empire collapsed in late 1991. It stopped paying rent again from
the quarter ending last December. It argues that it should be able to offset
the payments against money from MCC, which has not been provided. Mr Withall
is suing MGN for the outstanding amounts. He has offered the company a
settlement as part of negotiations for the sale of the site to the newspaper
group.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Tories unsettled by funds secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS ABOUT the sleazy image created by secrecy surrounding Conservative
party donors erupted in Tory ranks yesterday as Labour again exploited the
embarrasment caused by Mr Michael Mates' links with Mr Asil Nadir.
The Northern Ireland security minister's relationship with the fugitive
businessman who gave Pounds 440,000 to the Tory party has broken into a
wider debate. Should the party that supposedly supports open government be
more open about its own funding  - never mind its Pounds 19m deficit? Should
Tory MPs signed up to lobbying or public relations companies be explicit
about the companies they are working for?
The predicament will be seized on eagerly by the Labour party in the Commons
debate it has initiated tomorrow. Although Labour takes much of its money
from trade unions which have a large say in policy decisions, the party
leadership can argue that unions have by law to declare how much they pay
into political funds.
Labour backs state funding for parties and wants the Conservatives at least
to back a code of practice on donations. It also has a wider agenda to
portray Mr John Major's government as tired, corrupt and beleaguered by
internal contradictions in the hope of eventually precipitating his
downfall.
In response to the cur-rent row over Mr Nadir Sir Norman Fowler,
Conservative party chairman and loyal supporter of Mr Major, has not gone
much beyond promising that 'stolen' donations would be returned.
He told the Commons home affairs committee last week that the party had a
policy of refusing donations from foreign governments, donations with
strings attached, or from unknown sources.
There have, however, been some reforms over the past year. Sir Norman has
set out the proportions of Central Office funds coming from companies and
from individual donations in 1992-93. A balance sheet, setting out
Conservative party assets and liabilities, is to be published for the first
time.
But for the Tory hierarchy the principle that donors are entitled to privacy
is unchanged. The problem is how that can be reconciled with the search for
greater disclosure in order that charges of influence-buying can in future
be readily dismissed.
The Labour Research Department estimates that undisclosed donations to the
Tory party, including those from individuals, reached Pounds 15m in the year
up to the last general election  - almost certainly far exceeding
undisclosed donations to the Labour party.
Mr Richard Shepherd, Conservative MP for Aldridge Brownhills and supporter
of freedom of information, said the act of giving to the Tory party had to
be public.
He told BBC radio: 'Like Caesar's wife it should be beyond suspicion. As
long as things are done clandestinely and anonymously there is always a
suspicion that they are done for motives that are not appropriate.'
Mr David Mellor, former cabinet minister, said that out of 'the backwash' of
the controversy over Mr Mates 'there may well be some careful thinking about
the way that the Conservative party presents its accounts'.
Mr Peter Viggers, Conservative MP for Gosport, urged a debate on the Commons
committee report on the rules on the declaration of members' interests.
Working for a lobbying or public relations company was in a different league
to a normal company directorship because it was unclear who was buying an
MP's time, he said.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Licensing deal for Leyland supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR PANELS, a subsidiary of the specialist engineering company Mayflower,
has reached a licensing agreement with Leyland Trucks Manufacturing to
market the Ley-land cab range outside west Europe.
The Mayflower subsidiary is one of the most important suppliers to the newly
formed Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, which was acquired as a management
buy-out from the receiver two weeks ago following the financial collapse
earlier this year of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, and Leyland
Daf its UK subsidiary.
Motor Panels supplies the cabs for the present truck ranges produced at the
plant in Leyland, Lancashire, including the 45-series of light trucks.
Under the exclusive licensing agreement Motor Panels will be able to produce
the cabs for customers outside west Europe and for other specific Leyland
Truck Manufacturing markets.
In parallel with the formation of Leyland Trucks, Motor Panels has signed a
new five-year contract with the company to supply cabs with a value
estimated initially at about Pounds 20m over the life of the deal.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Smith may get second reform chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN IF Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, loses his fight at this year's
Labour Party conference to establish a new relationship between the party
and the unions he may have another chance next year, party officials say.
Labour's organisation committee will recommend to the party's national
executive next week that the most contentious issue between Mr Smith and the
unions - the establishment of a new system for selecting parliamentary
candidates - be postponed until the work of the Boundaries Commission is
complete next year.
That means that even if Mr Smith's support for removing the unions from the
selection procedure and introducing a system of 'one-member-one-vote' fails
at the conference this September, the issue can still be won next year
without causing havoc with selections procedures.
There is a strong chance that the executive will accept the organisation
committee recommendation. Some opponents of the Smith reform plan see the
move as an attempt by his supporters to create an opportunity to change the
rules next year.
But the Smith camp insists it is not interested in delay and can still win
the vote on the introduction of one-member-one-vote for the selection of
parliamentary candidates at this year's conference.
With most of the unions committed by their conference decisions to retain
the block vote, however, a Smith victory probably depends on a few big
unions abstaining.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey warns on Midland projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST MIDLANDS planners have been told there is no need for a further large
out-of-town shopping centre. They have been told that such a centre would
jeopardise investment elsewhere in the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation.
These recommendations are contained in a study assessing the impact on the
region of the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley by the consultants Roger
Tym and Partners and Colquhoun Transportation Planning.
The study, to be published soon, was commissioned by the region's local
authorities, Centro, their public transport arm, the environment department
and Marks and Spencer.
Taken with the running dispute about the legality of the planning permission
granted for a big retail development at Trafford, Manchester, the study's
findings fuel the arguments about the merits of large out-of-town shopping
centres when government economic and social policy is directed at inner city
regeneration.
Merry Hill, with 260 shops on 1.39m sq ft of retail floorspace, is the
second largest shopping centre in Europe, exceeded only by MetroCentre in
Gateshead. It was created by Richardson Developments on the site of an old
steelworks, bought by Mountleigh in 1990 and, after Mountleigh called in the
receivers, bought for Pounds 128m by Chelsfield last February.
The Roger Tym study found that Merry Hill gained market share between 1989
and 1993. 'By far the biggest loss was at Dudley, whose 1993 market share is
less than one third of the 1989 level,' it says. Stourbridge, West Bromwich
and Kidderminister also suffered significant falls in market share.
Mr Bill Brisbane, who worked on the study, noted that the Merry Hill impact
was not unique. MetroCentre had hurt Gateshead, and Meadowhall outside
Sheffield had hurt the town centre in the same way as Merry Hill had hurt
Dudley. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the Lakeside centre at Thurrock
was having a similar effect on Grays, Essex.
Mr Brisbane suggested that although Merry Hill had created 3,370 jobs - 69
per cent of them part-time - to replace those lost by the closure of the
steelworks and had drawn shoppers and hence funds into the region, it was
not yet possible to say that out-of-town shopping centres had 'a positive
net benefit' on the region in which they were situated.
In the case of the West Midlands, the study concludes that, as there is
unlikely to be significant population growth and 'in the short-term it is
improbable that there will be substantial growth in consumer expenditure',
there is little clear need for another centre such as Merry Hill.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Engineering earnings beat settlement rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE in earnings in the engineering sector may be running at nearly
twice the level of recorded settlements, due to 'pay drift', an unpublished
study by the Engineering Employers Federation says.
The latest settlement figures show a further fall to an average rise of 2.29
per cent for the three months to May. A total of 71 of the 290 deals were
'zero' settlements. In January, the busiest settlement month with 516
recorded, the average rise was 2.5 per cent.
But the federation's study found that, even when output was static, pay
drift  - which takes into account bonus payments, overtime pay and
piece-work  - usually accounts for an extra 2 per cent on top of settlement
levels.
The study covered 1985 to 1991 but federation officials say there has been
no significant change since then. The extent of pay drift may be on the
increase as output rises.
The report says: 'When output is growing rapidly, pay drift is high. In deep
recession pay drift is low. With engineering output static, pay drift
appears to amount to over 2 per cent a year.'
Pay drift is one of the reasons that the rise in average earnings in the
economy as a whole, now running at 4 per cent, tends to outstrip
settlements. The other main reason is that earnings are backward looking
over 12 months, so when inflation is falling earnings figures will include
higher settlements agreed several months ago when inflation was higher.
Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, welcomed the downward
settlement trend as 'encouraging' and said that average settlements have
been below 3 per cent for the past eight months, with freezes accounting for
24 per cent of the 1,210 settlements.
But he added: 'We have to continue to control our costs strictly even as we
begin to come out of recession. Nothing illustrates more starkly our need to
remain competitive than the huge trade deficit.'
In the three months to May, apart from the 71 zero settlements there were
143 at 3 per cent or less, 44 at between 3.1 per cent and 4 per cent and 32
at more than 4 per cent.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Employers optimistic on outlook for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER SIGNS of employer optimism about job prospects are expressed in a
survey published today by Manpower, the employment services company.
The survey, part of a regular series, shows that 22 per cent of the 2,200
companies contacted forecast job increases for the third quarter of the year
while 13 per cent forecast job losses, resulting in a positive net balance
of 9 per cent.
Manpower said this compared favourably with the net balance of minus 1 per
cent last quarter and a positive net balance of 6 per cent last year.
No region is forecasting net job losses in the coming quarter, with London,
south Wales and the south of England among the most positive, the survey
shows.
Job prospects in the capital, which have been negative in the past few
surveys, show a positive net balance of 3 per cent.
The manufacturing and service sectors are more optimistic than last year.
The banking industry, energy and water were the industries in the service
sector which were most negative about job prospects.
The public sector was the least positive about employment prospects. Local
government was the most gloomy.
Manpower said: 'The continued weakness in this sector is probably due to the
increasing levels of sub-contracting and continued budgetary pressures.'

FT  21 JUN 93 / Standards organisation finds itself on trial: The
resignation of its chief executive and impending government scrutiny signal
a shake-up for the BSI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE space of two weeks the British Standards Institution, which writes
standards for industry, has lost its chief executive after a boardroom row
and the government has ordered a review of the institution and its
activities.
BSI says the two events were unconnected. But for an organisation with a
profile low to the point of invisibility, this sudden flurry of activity
suggests that something is amiss.
As well as having a monopoly in co-ordinating the writing of standards, BSI
carries out product testing and certification in competition with dozens of
independent laboratories and commercial certification companies.
The combination of these activities  - BSI's German and French counterparts
are responsible only for writing standards  - has turned BSI into a large
and profitable business. It made an operating surplus of Pounds 7.5m last
year on turnover of Pounds 74m and employs more than 2,000 people. Its new
quality assurance standard, BS5750, adopted by about 20,000 British
bussineses, has proved a money-spinner, contributing nearly half of turnover
and two thirds of the surplus.
There has been growing controversy over BS5750, however. Small businesses in
particular say it is bureaucratic and inappropriate to their needs. They
have forced BSI to set up a committee to review the issue.
Meanwhile, there is increasing demand for Europe-wide standards. Countries
which take the lead in writing European and international standards  - the
UK, Germany and France each account for more than 20 per cent of
international standards  - can gain considerable competitive advantage.
Highly profitable though it is, BSI's transformation from a quasi Civil
Service bureaucracy into a commercial organisation has been recent and has
involved considerable  - as yet unfinished  - changes.
Mr Michael Sanderson, formerly managing director of AWD Bedford Trucks, was
brought in as BSI's first chief executive 18 months ago to spearhead its
modernisation and 'lead a major programme of cultural change'. BSI's
cumbersome committee structure was simplified to speed decision making.
Mr Sanderson resigned on June 1 over what the company called 'a deep
disagreement with the board on important matters of policy and management'.
Neither side would comment further, although there is a suspicion among
industry observers that Mr Sanderson was not pushing change at a fast enough
rate.
Barely had Mr Sanderson cleared his desk when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, announced a government review of BSI, its funding
and the issue of standards writing. He has called into question whether such
a profitable organisation needs the Pounds 4.5m annual government subsidy it
receives, whether the standards it writes are of sufficiently high quality
and how industry's input should be organised.
The government estimates that industry's contribution to standards writing
amounts to Pounds 200m in the form of expert time provided to the standards
drafting committees.
The government wants to know if standards contribute to the competitiveness
of British industry and what BSI's role should be now that European and
international standards are becoming more important than national standards.
Mr Derek Prior, communications manager, said BSI received much less
government support than its Continental counterparts and 'could produce a
plan for survival without a government grant.'
He dismissed the suggestion that the move to European and international
standards could threaten BSI  - instead it increased the need for strong
national standards bodies to represent national interests, he said.
BSI may have survived previous official reviews unscathed, but the present
government is committed to privatisation and to saving money where it can,
and BSI's mounting profitability may increase its chances of being
privatised.

Several thousand Names have taken legal action to recover insurance losses.
Tomorrow Lloyd's will announce record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and
Pounds 2.8bn for the 1990 underwriting year.
Some solicitors involved suggest Judge Saville could press for a test case

FT  21 JUN 93 / Cadbury code attracts criticism
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW JACK

<TEXT>
A GROWING number of companies are expressing criticism of the Cadbury code
of corporate governance, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monthly monitoring service of annual reports, Andrew Jack writes.
Companies are saying the code is costly, ineffective in improving the
standards of governance and irrelevant, the survey shows.
The public statements come after a recent speech by Mr Michael Lawrence,
chairman of the 100 Group of leading finance directors, criticising the
growing burden of regulations and standards being imposed on companies from
many sources.
REA, the plantation group, says in its annual report that the burden and
cost of Cadbury are 'to be regretted' and they cannot 'ensure the integrity
and competence which must be the basis of an enduring business structure'.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Bosses adopt more green policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S boardrooms are devoting an increasing amount of time to
environmental issues, although they are still given relatively low priority
in many businesses.
A survey conducted among 325 UK companies on behalf of the Institute of
Directors shows that, in spite of the recession, directors are paying more
attention to the impact which their businesses have on the environment.
Nearly one third say they have adopted a formal corporate environmental
policy but the report also concludes that most continue to address the issue
'as a threat and not as an opportunity'.
A rising number of directors acknowledge that environmental considerations
are being driven primarily by the need for compliance, rather than by
broader social considerations.
Nearly three quarters have yet to operate any form of environmental audit
and only 1 per cent of businesses have a manager with specific
responsibility for environmental issues. In most companies the managing
director is still held to be responsible. The survey shows that 65 per cent
of company directors say the environment featured on their board's agenda
last year, up from 53 per cent the previous year.
Predictably, companies in construction, mining and manufacturing regularly
featured the environment on the board's agenda, while service and
distribution operations were less concerned.
But the survey also shows that few companies spend more than 10 per cent of
boardroom time on environmental questions. Nearly half the companies
surveyed reported that they were undertaking investment to meet
environmental obligations. More than one third said action was being taken
in response to laws either planned or already imposed by the UK and EC,
while the balance cited social responsibility, 'corporate citizenship' or
market forces as the impetus.
Only 6 per cent of the directors questioned rated themselves very
knowledgeable about their companies' legal environmental responsibilities,
and 44 per cent thought they were quite well informed.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Mortgage arrears leap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of homeowners in the UK more than six months in arrears with
their mortgage payments has risen by a quarter, the most extensive and
up-to-date survey of mortgage debt shows.
The survey, published today in Roof magazine, shows that 360,100 households
were six or more months behind with their mortgage payments at the end of
March, up from 290,080 last year. The number in short-term debt is
continuing to fall but one in 12 homeowners is two or more months in arrears
with mortgage payments. In spite of the halving of interest rates since 1991
the total in arrears of two months or more rose by 27,000 in the year to the
end of March, bringing the total to 800,150.
The survey, carried out annually by Ms Janet Ford of Loughborough
University, draws on data from 41 lenders of all types, responsible for 60
per cent of UK loans. It covers more lenders than the figures released
periodically by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which do not include
short-term arrears.
The figures highlight the trend in arrears from short-term to long-term
debt. The number of households two months in arrears is at its lowest for
four years. Arrears of more than a year have jumped by more than 50 per cent
to 156,740.
The growth in the number of homeowners more than a year in arrears reflects
the success of the government in persuading lenders not to repossess such
homes. Until the launch of the mortgage rescue package at the end of 1991
lenders normally repossessed homes when arrears exceeded six months. One
element in the package was the direct payment to lenders of the part of
social security benefits meant to cover mortgage interest. But only 17 per
cent of those covered by the direct payment of mortgage interest are in
arrears, according to the survey.
The vast majority of those in arrears do not qualify for means-tested
benefits. About four fifths of those in arrears are outside the social
security safety net, and are typically people in low-wage employment or
families where only one partner is unemployed.
The survey says that the number of homes repossessed in the year to March
was 60,500. This compares with the CML figure of 68,540 for last year and
suggests that repossessions in the first quarter have fallen to almost half
the level of the first quarter of last year.

FT  21 JUN 93 / New building for Lloyd's Register
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S REGISTER, the ship classification society, has applied for planning
permission for a 35,000 sq m development in Liphook, Hampshire, which will
be designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership.
The new building will house 1,350 staff from Lloyd's existing offices in
Fenchurch Street and Croydon. The company will retain its listed building at
71 Fenchurch Street to give it a presence in the City.
The planning application is expected to be considered by the East Hampshire
District Council's planning committee in mid July. If it is approved work
will start in September 1994, with completion by the end of 1996.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Hotels push up profits by tight cost control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT COST control enabled UK hotels to increase their operating profits by
3.3 per cent last year, in spite of a slight fall in revenues and only a
small increase in occupancy, a survey to be published by leisure consultants
Pannell Kerr Forster this week shows.
London hotels increased operating profits by 10.9 per cent, aided by cuts in
administrative and property maintenance costs.
Mr Andrew Duncan, a director of the consultancy, said hotels would have to
increase maintenance spending on their properties in future years to
compensate for cost-cutting during the recession.
He said, however, that he did not think hotels had reduced maintenance
spending to the point where it had damaged the quality of their properties.
Although London hotels increased marketing expenditure last year, English
provincial hotels had cut back.
Mr Duncan said reductions in marketing expenditure during a downturn were
misguided, as hotels should be attempting to increase market share.
The survey of 229 hotels found that UK occupancy rose 2.6 per cent to 62 per
cent last year. Average room-rates fell 4.4 per cent Pounds 56.55, however.
Annual revenue per available room fell 0.3 per cent to Pounds 24,990.
Reduced administrative, marketing and maintenance costs lifted operating
income per available room by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 7,956.
In London average revenues per available room increased 2.6 per cent to
Pounds 33,544, although spending on beverages fell 3.9 per cent.
Operating profit per room was Pounds 12,301. Average occupancy in London
rose to 70.4 per cent from 65.2 per cent in 1991. The average room-rate fell
5.3 per cent to Pounds 80.92.
Operating profit at English provincial hotels fell 2.4 per cent to Pounds
6,319, while profits in Wales fell 8.8 per cent to Pounds 4,784 per
available room.
Operating profits in Scotland rose 3.9 per cent to Pounds 7,186.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S main black leaders have agreed to meet on Wednesday for talks
aimed at breaking a cycle of township violence and accelerating a transition
from white rule to democracy, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Church leaders said Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, president of the Inkatha Freedom party, would meet in
Johannesburg. The talks were brokered by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The two men have not held direct talks since April 1991, according to
Inkatha offic-ials.
Their enmity has been fanned by a war among their supporters which has
accounted for most of the 9,000 deaths in black township clashes since
President F W de Klerk repudiated apartheid in 1990.
The leaders differ on the shape of a future democracy, with Chief Buthelezi
demanding virtual autonomy for his KwaZulu tribal homeland and Mr Mandela
pressing for strong central government.

POLICE in Egypt defused two bombs yesterday, including one in the Cairo
suburb where a bomb blast killed seven people last week, news reports said,
AP writes from Cairo.
The state-run Middle East News Agency said a package containing a bomb was
left in front of a shop on a busy street at Aswan, a main tourist town in
the south.
A resident noticed the package and called police, the agency said. The bomb
contained nails, a timer and gunpowder, an interior ministry official told
the MENA.
In the Cairo suburb of Shubra, police found another bomb, cordoned off the
area and defused it, the newspaper al-Ahram reported early today.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Bombs raise suspicion and fear in Egypt / Analysis of a
series of fatal outrages in Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPTIANS this weekend digested with anger, apprehension and confusion the
latest in a recent series of apparently random terrorist attacks  - a bomb
that on Friday killed seven Egyptians and maimed at least 20 others. It
seems to mark a sharp change of tack in the violent anti-government campaign
by Islamic extremists.
The blast, which resounded across central Cairo like a thunderclap, was the
fourth in the capital within a month and brought to 16 dead and 69 injured
the number of Egyptian casualties in the latest attacks. The bomb exploded
in a main street of the poor north-eastern suburb of Shubra, where it was
certain to inflict civilian Egyptian casualties. Like the previous three
bombs since May 21, it had been packed with nails to cause serious injury if
not death.
The attack was immediately condemned by the Moslem Brotherhood, Egypt's main
and professedly moderate Islamic grouping, which decried it as an 'ugly
crime' in a strongly worded denunciation yesterday.
It was met with rage by locals in Shubra, where impromptu demonstrations
called on the government to exact bloody revenge on the terrorists.
The attack appears to have been a bad own-goal for Islamic militants and a
propaganda coup for the government, which had tried to rally equal
indignation over attacks on tourist targets and security personnel. These
have crippled the country's tourism industry and provoked a sweeping and
brutal security crackdown.
However, the Gamaa al-Islamiyya, the underground Islamic militant group
which has previously claimed responsibility for attacks on police and
tourist targets, has stayed silent over the latest bombings.
Moreover, in previous claims of responsibility for attacks on tourist buses
or sites, the Gamaa al-Islamiyya routinely distanced itself from attacks on
individuals  - making an exception for their bloody vendetta-like war
against the security forces.
The attacks were on 'tourism, not tourists', it said, emphasising its aim to
undermine the government by ruining the economy.
This raises puzzling questions over the aim, and the perpetrators, of the
latest bombings, which include a car blast in a busy street on May 21,
killing seven, and an explosion in a central Cairo underpass on May 27 which
claimed two Egyptian lives and injured five British tourists in a bus which
happened to be passing as the time-bomb was detonated.
Senior government officials yesterday, however, were in no doubt that the
Gamaa al-Islamiyya was behind the attacks, and claimed that the randomness
of these indicated its increasing desperation. 'These people are in retreat,
politically speaking,' said Mr Mamdouh Beltagui, state information director.
'They have lost political direction'.
This, he said, was the result of the effective decapitation of the Gamaa by
a security crackdown in which thousands of suspects have been detained,
dozens shot by security forces or tried by military courts, and more than 20
sentenced to death.
Western diplomats in Cairo argue that there may be some truth to the
government's claims, particularly given the duration, intensity and strength
of the security effort against the Gamaa. 'The latest attacks could just be
a last-gasp attempt to prove they are still in business,' one said
yesterday.
But this analysis offers most Egyptians limited reassurance. The latest
attacks have been the bloodiest  - and the bombs used among the most
sophisticated  - of the extremists' campaign. Each fresh attack, moreover,
has defiantly followed fresh rounds of mass detentions of suspected
extremists. Just yesterday, police claimed to have found and defused another
nail bomb in Assiut.
Even the propaganda value of the latest attacks may prove of limited
political value to the government, which has generally enjoyed little
sympathy, in its battle with the Gamaa, among many Egyptians who see it as
increasingly corrupt, unresponsive to their material needs and generally
aloof. In a town prone to rumour and conspiracy theory, Cairenes are already
wondering whom the latest attacks serve better than the government itself.
Mr Abdel-Halim Mandour, a lawyer who has defended Gamaa suspects in recent
trials, said yesterday the latest bombings ran counter to the Islamic
group's strategy. They were, he concluded, the work of 'foreign or local
parties who are hostile to the Islamists', seeking to 'justify the random
punishment and death sentences taking place against them'.
In the end, there appears, for the moment, to be no other discernible motive
for the bombing on Friday and its recent precedents than to heighten a
feeling of apprehension and fear in the capital. That, whoever is
responsible, has been achieved.

CAMBODIA'S former battlefield rivals will jointly control the powerful army
and police force, under a power-sharing deal agreed last Friday, a senior
government official said on yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
The official said the former communist government party and the royalist
Funcinpec opposition, which won the UN-organised election last month, would
share the key defence and interior ministries. The ruling party would
surrender control of foreign affairs and finance to the royalists, the
official said.
Incumbent Prime Minister Hun Sen and Funcinpec leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh  - enemies through 13 years of civil war  - agreed to serve as
co-chairmen of an interim government meant to rule for up to three months
while the new assembly writes a constitution.
The finance ministry is expected to play an increasingly important role when
hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid is pumped into the
war-ravaged economy.

<TEXT>
CHINA'S plans to establish an export-import bank to promote its growing
trading interests are well advanced, according to a senior Chinese official
responsible for establishing the 'trade bank'.
Mr Tong Zhiguang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation,
expects the institution to open soon.
One of its aims would be to facilitate exports of capital goods such as
electronics and machinery, which accounted for less than a quarter of
China's exports in 1992. Textiles and light industrial products form the
bulk of China's exports.
Mr Tong said the new bank would provide import and export credits, export
credit insurance and project financing. The state would help finance it.
The bank would be likely to float bonds at home and abroad.
'Our economy is growing very fast, and this means that the growth rate of
our foreign trade must keep pace,' Mr Tong said. Two-way trade reached
Dollars 165.6bn (Pounds 110.4bn) last year, with exports of Dollars 85bn.
China, whose exports grew more slowly than imports in the first quarter,
wants to boost exports of sophisticated value-added goods. Northern Telecom
of Toronto expects to become a leading supplier of telephone switches and
other telecommunications equipment to China, under a deal signed with
China's State Planning Commission, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The memorandum of understanding covers various manufacturing, research and
training projects, including joint ventures for the development and
manufacture of large-scale circuits and switching systems.
Northern expects the deal to result in sales worth 'billions of dollars'
over the next few years. Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said
that business flowing from the agreement could become the most extensive in
the company's history. The company also regards the agreement as an effort
by China to broaden sources of telecommunications equipment and expertise.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Nigerian poll disarray grows
</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE democratic process in Nigeria slid further into confusion during a
weekend of indecision by the military government, which has allowed a legal
technicality to suppress the results of presidential elections held on June
12.
With 10 years of military rule due to end on August 27, Nigeria's transition
to democracy is in disarray. More than a week after one of Nigeria's fairest
general elections, the country has a self-proclaimed winner, an unconfirmed
loser, a commission put in charge by the president which seems to have no
power, and high court judges in three states passing conflicting rulings on
a process outside their jurisdiction.
According to state radio at the weekend, President Ibrahim Babangida told Mr
Iyorchia Ayu, head of the senate, that he still wanted the elections
concluded, if the process was within the rule of law.
Most voters are unconvinced by this statement and there were signs yesterday
that the government lacked the support of most of the military hierarchy and
senior civilian politicians for its faltering stance on these elections.
A presidential decree in April gave the National Electoral Commission (NEC)
a free hand to conduct the elections and publish the results by yesterday at
the latest, and to consider any malpractice claims.
With no direct public statement from the president since before the
elections, and no word from the head of the NEC, Professor Humphrey Nwosu,
since the middle of last week, it is not clear how the government intends to
resolve the crisis.
A prominent lawyer, Mr Gani Fawehinmi, said last week the 'military
government is leading Nigeria into an immeasurable political crisis which
can only be averted if the results are declared by June 20', failing which
the results become invalid.
Mr Wole Soyinka, winner of a Nobel prize for literature, said a 'tiny but
powerful cabal is toying with the future of our nation. Any further delay in
making the people's verdict official is a deliberate cultivation of chaos'.
Mr Moshood Abiola, candidate of the Social Democratic Party, has declared
himself the winner, after an unofficial announcement of the results by a
leading democracy campaigner, Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, on Friday. The opposing
candidate, Mr Bashir Othman Tofa, has stayed quiet and not challenged the
outcome.
The British government on Friday issued a statement 'regretting that a court
order was restraining the release of the official results.
'This has inevitably raised questions about whether the transition to
civilian rule by August 27 will proceed. All the reports we have received
from observers on the ground suggest that the elections were peaceful,
orderly and gave Nigerians a full opportunity to express their views.'

FT  21 JUN 93 / Japan must act to cut trade surplus says Bank governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN should deregulate its economy to open its markets and make its trading
practices more transparent in response to US pressure for a cut in its trade
surplus, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, said at the
weekend.
Mr Mieno, in an interview with the FT, said no more could be done at the
moment to stimulate the Japanese economy and boost demand for imports. He
warned that any attempt to reduce the surplus rapidly with expansionary
macro-economic policies would lead to higher inflation in Japan which would
damage world growth prospects.
As a result, Japan had to respond with structural reforms to match measures
taken by its trading partners to reduce the trade surplus, which is expected
to reach Dollars 150bn this year.
Mr Mieno's comments come at a critical time, with the Japanese political
system in turmoil and a general election due on July 18, following the
government's defeat in a no-confidence vote on Friday.
Talks with the US over a framework to discuss trade tensions are reaching a
critical point with the outline of an approach covering macro-economic
policies and structural measures due to be agreed by a summit between
President Bill Clinton and the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
on July 5. The US alleges imports into Japan are restricted by closed
business practices which discriminate against foreign companies.
Mr Mieno said the Japanese economy would start a moderate recovery in the
autumn but he warned that even sustainable growth in Japan would leave a
large trade surplus.
He said: 'We should not reduce the trade surplus because the US says so but
out of responsibility for the world economy and to promote the global
liberal trading system.'
Mr Mieno continued: 'We should, first, keep our economy on a
non-inflationary stable growth path and, second, deregulate and reconsider
our trading practices.'
He said Japan had done as much as it could to promote growth with
pump-priming measures and low interest rates. As a result other action would
be needed to respond to international criticism of the surplus. Mr Mieno
said the important point was to heighten the transparency of 'our market and
our economic system.'

wrestles for power with former communist boss

<TEXT>
MR Heydar Aliyev, the Brezhnev-era communist boss who on Friday assumed
power in Azerbaijan, was last night locked in a struggle with the military
rebel whose revolt helped catapult him to the presidency.
The leader of the revolt, Mr Surat Husseynov, whose forces last night moved
to within six miles of the capital, Baku, has demanded political and
military power, diplomats said. According to Mr Aliyev, Mr Husseynov wants
to become prime minister, and to control the interior and defence
ministries, and the state security arm, the KGB.
Mr Aliyev accused Mr Husseynov of attempting a coup d'etat, and said: 'I
won't allow that. I'll do my best to avoid this.'
Mr Aliyev, a former KGB and communist party chief, emerged from six years of
political exile to become acting president on Friday, when the republic's
beleaguered elected president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, secretly left the
capital in a pre-dawn flight, and took refuge in his home village.
The political crisis was triggered on June 4 when Mr Husseynov's private
army, approximately 3,000 strong, seized Azerbaijan's second largest city,
Gyanja, and demanded Mr Elchibey's resignation.
It was initially thought that Mr Husseynov and Mr Aliyev were political
allies, but it has since become clear that the army rebel has his own
agenda. Earlier yesterday Mr Aliyev said he had been negotiating secretly
with Mr Husseynov to halt the rebellion.
Around 50 of Mr Husseynov's men set up barracades on the western approach to
the city and said they were under the command of Mr Husseynov's deputy in
Baku, Mr Rahim Gaziev, a former defence minister.
They claimed that another group of rebels was coming from the other main
road into the capital from the north.
Mr Aliyev yesterday urged Mr Elchibey to return to Baku, castigating him for
leaving the capital. 'The captain should be the last to leave the ship,' Mr
Aliyev said.
In a separate development, Azerbaijan's political crisis may be imperilling
attempts to end the five-year-old war in the Azerbaijan region of
Nagorno-Karabakh. A meeting planned in Baku this week to start implementing
a peace plan has been cancelled.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Referendum may strengthen Kiev reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFERENDUMS are catching on in the former Soviet republics. First, Russian
president Boris Yeltsin, under pressure from the parliament, put his
leadership to the test in April's referendum. Now the Ukrainian parliament
has responded to President Kravchuk's assumption of wider executive powers
by voting to hold a referendum of confidence in both the president and
parliament in September. In Russia, the referendum has strengthened the hand
of the economic reformers. Might the same be true in Ukraine?
Something certainly had to be done to give a new reform in Kiev a new
impetus. After a seemingly promising start last December, prime minister
Leonid Kuchma has appeared to lose his grip, culminating in last week's
presidential decree declaring that Mr Kuchma will head an 'emergency
committee' to run the economy under Mr Kravchuk's control. Meanwhile, the
state of the economy has deteriorated rapidly. One of the best measures of
economic progress in the former Soviet economies is the black market
exchange rate. Output statistics are heavily distorted, unemployment rates
meaningless and official inflation rates unreliable. But the willingness of
the population to hold the currency gives a relatively undistorted measure
of inflationary pressures and confidence in the government's economic
strategy.
The judgment of the Ukrainian public has been severe, as the left-hand chart
shows. It tracks the exchange rate between Ukrainian coupon and US dollars
at which black market traders buy dollars in Kiev. The exchange rates are
measured weekly in a project run by Mr Simon Johnson of the Fuqua School of
Business, Duke University and Mr Oleg Ustenko of the Kiev State Economics
University.
The coupon has fallen in value by nearly 250 per cent against the dollar
since the beginning of the year. The sharpest falls occurred in April when
it emerged that the central bank had released a new tranche of credits
without informing the government. The unofficial inflation rate, compiled by
measuring the prices of the same basket of goods each month in Kiev state
stores, has accelerated back towards 50 per cent a month.
The coupon has, as a result, the dubious privilege of being one of the few
currencies in the world that has depreciated against the Russian rouble this
year. The rouble-dollar exchange, measured by a Johnson-Ustenko team in St
Petersburg, has fallen by 188 per cent this year. In Kiev, the coupon has
slipped in value from 1.95 roubles at the beginning of January to 2.6
roubles last week. At this rate, a smart trader with transport can just make
a profit from round-tripping between Kiev and St Petersburg.
If President Kravchuk is serious about stabilising the inflation, then the
Russian experience suggests a popular referendum might help his cause. Since
Mr Yeltsin's victory, the Russian government has been able to reach a credit
agreement with the central bank which has met with approval from the
International Monetary Fund. The rouble exchange rate has stabilised in
recent weeks in the expectation that IMF financial aid will provide a new
source of non-inflationary budget finance this year.
But first the Ukrainian government has to win the referendum. For a
president with extensive executive powers, the temptation to buy votes by
agreeing to popular increases in subsidies and welfare benefits is probably
overwhelming. Certainly Mr Yeltsin took this approach which explains the
slump in the rouble exchange rate in April and May and the coupon's recovery
against the rouble.
Western advisers now believe the underlying Russian inflation rate has
fallen below 20 per cent. But the Johnson-Ustenko unofficial measure puts
the rate above that in St Petersburg in the early weeks of this month.
Ukraine starts its referendum campaign with a monthly inflation rate already
in the 50 per cent region, the threshold at which inflation becomes
hyperinflation. Ukraine now faces a destabilising few months. Watch the
coupon.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Blow for auditors of failed thrifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between banking regulators and several US accounting firms for
out-of-court settlements in connection with their audits of failed savings
and loans institutions appear to have suffered a setback.
The Resolution Trust Corporation has filed a series of lawsuits against
Deloitte &amp; Touche which had previously been on hold while discussions took
place with government officials.
Last year it issued suits in place of negotiations against Arthur Andersen,
and it has also brought action against KPMG Peat Marwick in relation to
audits of failed thrifts and banks. It has filed a total of 250 professional
indemnity suits.
Until earlier this year the agency had been in discussion with Deloitte &amp;
Touche using 'tolling agreements', which allow talks to continue without
lawsuits being filed beyond the normal three year statute of limitations.
Six such tolling agreements between the RTC and Deloitte &amp; Touche lapsed
earlier this year and suits have now been filed, leaving the firm with 12
suits with claims for about Dollars 1.4bn.
Last summer the RTC filed a suit against Andersen several months after the
limitation period was up, suggesting a similar tolling agreement had been in
place and then allowed to expire.
The approach appears to contrast with the negotiated 'omnibus' legal
settlement announced last November with Ernst &amp; Young, in which the firm
agreed to pay Dollars 400m and retrain staff in exchange for dropping a
series of actions.
Those close to the negotiations from the accounting firms suggest that the
new difficulties have in part been generated by a change in key staff in the
three regulatory bodies taking legal action, the RTC, the Office of Thrift
Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They also point
to criticism of the agreement with Ernst &amp; Young by Henry Gonzalez, US House
banking committee chairman.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Clash looming with US over procurement policy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION has risen between the US and Japan over government procurement which
could damage sensitive negotiations this week in Tokyo on a tariff reduction
package for the Uruguay Round.
After years of complaints about Japan's closed bidding system on
construction services and two agreements which have produced little
progress, the US formally brought a trade complaint on April 30. It has 60
days to negotiate a solution to eliminate the 'discriminatory practice' or
announce sanctions.
US law gives the president the right to postpone retaliation if it would
harm US interest to act. But it is not certain that President Clinton would
invoke that provision.
Both he and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, have talked of
the need to enforce trade agreements. Few disputes have dragged on as long
as construction services with as little to show for American patience.
If Tokyo continues to fail to respond to US demands for a negotiating
framework with quantifiable measures, Washington may want to fire a warning
shot.
US and Japanese negotiators this week had another attempt at negotiating a
deal on construction services. Washington submitted a four point package
which included:
Expanded coverage of the current Major Project Arrangement accord.
An end to Japan's use of the 'designated bidder system' for public works
procurement and replacement by an open bidding system.
Enhanced anti-monopoly enforcement to discourage bid-rigging.
Establishment of a system for measuring progress.
According to a US trade official, the package was rejected, and the Japanese
offered to negotiate on another US proposal, which they had earlier turned
down.
For several years the Japanese have said American engineering and
architectural companies must form joint ventures with Japanese partners in
order to understand the particular demands of the Japanese construction and
design market.
The number of projects on which US companies and their partners can bid has
increased, but the process has produced few contracts.
American companies won less than Dollars 200m of bids last year. US trade
officials argue that Japanese construction companies are not competitive in
the international market. The US held a 45.4 per cent share of this market
in 1991, compared with a 7.2 per cent share for Japan.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Kravchuk retreats in Ukraine power struggle

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday back-pedalled in the battle
over extra powers for the popular reformist prime minister, Mr Leonid
Kuchma.
On Saturday, Mr Kuchma, angered by the president's unilateral move last week
to take direct control over the government, lashed out at Mr Kravchuk,
accusing him of 'robbing the country'. According to the media, Mr Kuchma
also tendered his resignation for the third time this month, but the prime
minister's aides said yesterday the reports were inaccurate.
The increasingly acrimonious conflict between the president and prime
minister has paralysed the country at a time when decisive measures are
needed if the economy is to be saved from collapse.
Kiev won a brief respite over the week-end, when coal miners in eastern
Ukraine called off their 10-day strike. However, the price of this reprieve
was a new tranche of subsidies to the coal sector which is expected to
trigger another round of inflation.
Mr Kuchma, who has earned a reputation in Ukraine and the west as a
competent technocrat, is perceived as the only figure able to implement the
painful economic reforms Ukraine requires.
But Mr Kuchma has said he needs extra-ordinary authority over the economy in
order to implement his programme. That has troubled Mr Kravchuk, who fears
that if the prime minister succeeds in his bid for additional power then the
president will be left an overly circumscribed role.
Mr Kravchuk reached for a compromise last week, issuing a decree putting Mr
Kuchma in charge of an 'emergency committee' to run the economy, but giving
himself direct control over the government.
But, as he made clear in a passionate speech in his power base of
Dnipropetrovsk on Saturday, Mr Kuchma is unwilling to go along with this new
arrangement. 'I understand that the prime minister is no more because the
government is headed by the president,' Mr Kuchma said.
Mr Kravchuk, whose fear of Mr Kuchma's rising popularity is matched only by
his concern that without the prime minister Ukraine's economy will run
further adrift, back-pedalled yesterday.
'I am not going to insist on everything remaining unchanged,' Mr Kravchuk
said. 'There can be changes (to the controversial decree) if there are
constructive proposals.' But Mr Kravchuk also made clear that he is
unwilling to relinquish all power to Mr Kuchma.
Parliament is likely to act as referee in the increasingly hostile conflict.
One option would be for parliament to try to block the presidential decree
on constitutional grounds and to grant Mr Kuchma the extra powers he has
been seeking for the past month.
But although the legislature is generally inclined toward the prime
minister, it is divided and might be unable to muster the political will to
challenge the president.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: Social blight deep in structure - Why
is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US or
Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors? / FT writers report
as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit

<TEXT>
ALARM and pity about unemployment are nothing new. 'A man willing to work
and unable to find work is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune's
inequality exhibits under the sun,' wrote the Scottish thinker Thomas
Carlyle in 1839.
In terms of mere physical well-being, the EC's 17m unemployed are better off
than those without jobs in Carlyle's day or during the 1930s depression.
What has changed for the worse is the long-term hopelessness engendered by
an EC problem which has persisted for a generation.
The Community's unemployment rate, about 2 per cent before the 1973-74 oil
price shock, has ratcheted up remorselessly. Each cyclical upturn has
receded, leaving a larger proportion of jobless.
The jobless figures themselves are managed, massaged, manipulated and moaned
over - permanent symbols of a dissatisfied society.
With every wave of protestation by politicians and trade unionists that the
level is unacceptably high has come a fresh wave of public disillusionment
about their inability to do much about it.
Pump-priming 1930s-style is no longer appropriate - not only because of the
size of government deficits, but also because many structural causes of
unemployment would not be resolved, even if the Community were to find its
way back to 3 per cent growth.
There is no shortage of microeconomic suggestions to correct the trend. Many
of these proposals, such as real wage cuts and more flexible working
methods, are economically sound.
The long-term jobless might, however, note cynically that these recipes are
mainly offered by commentators suffering from over-work rather than
under-work, and whose real wages have shown a comforting propensity never to
fall.
The latest Commission document on 'a framework for employment' highlights
the less-than-inspiring options on offer. The document, put forward by Mr
Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, outlines 'a process of analysis
and policy reflections on possible solutions.' The aim is 'some operational
conclusions over an 18-month period.'
But the EC's room for manoeuvre room seems inversely proportional to the
political sensitivity of the issues it would like to address.
The single-market programme, for example, set forth a tide of investment in
the second half of the 1980s which contributed to the Community's buoyancy.
Now, however, the programme is becoming increasingly associated in public
opinion with job-killing corporate restructuring, diminishing further
popular enthusiasm for European union.
Also, the latest rise in unemployment is coinciding with intense immigration
pressure. To discontented populations in eastern Europe or the third world,
even a high-unemployment Community looks to be a source of succour.

Euro-sclerosis' - Why is unemployment so much worse in the European
Community than in the US or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper
factors? / FT writers report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit

THE European Commission is worried. Mass unemployment has become a scar
across the Community, threatening the social and political cohesion of a
single market in which 10 per cent of the labour force are excluded from its
supposed rewards.
But the Commission's concern runs deeper: it fears the combination of
persistent unemployment and sluggish job creation in EC countries, relative
to other developed countries, may indicate a lack of flexibility and
competitiveness. These fears led Commission President Jacques Delors last
month to order a study of the EC's unemployment and competitiveness.
Euro-sclerosis - the notion that European economic performance is being
undermined by excessive regulation and labour market inflexibility - is thus
firmly on the EC agenda at today's summit.
Europe's recent record has certainly been miserable. EC employment fell by
1.3 per cent last year. The Commission's latest forecasts expect a fall of
more than 1.75 per cent this year, the worst performance in EC history. As a
result, the Commission expects EC unemployment to rise to 12 per cent next
year, over 17m people, and fall only modestly thereafter.
The immediate cause of this poor performance is the recession. So long as
the European exchange rate mechanism continues to transmit high German
interest rates across the continent, growth will remain depressed and
unemployment will keep rising.
European officials play down the effects of falling output. But a group of
leading US economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by
Nobel prize winner Mr Franco Modigliani said recently they were 'amazed'
that Mr Delors' unemployment initiative made no mention of the Bundesbank's
high interest rates. 'We believe this policy to be one of the major, if not
the major, cause of unemployment in the EC,' they said.
Still, EC countries have good reason to feel worried when they look beyond
lower interest rates and recovery to the future. For unemployment appears to
be 'ratcheting up' from each cyclical trough to the next.
And the malaise runs deeper. Europe has high unemployment, but also a
miserable record of job creation compared with other developed countries.
Twenty years ago the percentage of the US population of working age who had
jobs was much the same as that of the EC. Since then the US has succeeded in
increasing the numbers in employment by 30m - three times as many as the
Community.
As a result the EC has a very low rate of employment compared to other
industrialised countries - less than 60 per cent of the working age
population is in employment, compared to around 70 per cent in the US and
Efta countries and over 75 per cent in Japan.
What, EC governments ask, has gone wrong? The economic performance of the US
over the past 20 years, judged by its growth rate, export performance or
budget and trade deficits, has not been noticeably better than that of
Europe.
Both regions worry about the small but growing competitive threat from
low-cost east Asian producers; both have seen technological change reduce
the number of 'good' manufacturing jobs for poorly educated male manual
workers at other than low wages; neither have been very effective at
replacing old-style manufacturing jobs with well-paid ones in high
technology industries.
So why is unemployment persistently higher in Europe? Why are US workers,
especially women, more likely to find a job than Europeans? And why have
only 6 per cent of North America's unemployed been out of work for more than
a year compared to nearly 50 per cent of European job seekers?
The answer seems to be the regulated nature of the European jobs market, as
the OECD, the European Commission and national governments are increasingly
realising. In the US, with a deregulated, job-creating labour market, the
result has not been long-term unemployment but, instead, falling real wages
for people in work. Real wages for the poorest 10 per cent of US workers
have fallen by a third since 1970, while unemployment benefits offer only a
short-term alternative. Many women have entered the labour force - a
worrying number of prime-age male workers have left it entirely.
Most European governments have deliberately avoided the US route - the
creation of large numbers of low wage, service sector jobs - by preventing
pay from falling through maintaining relatively high minimum wages and
unemployment benefits or public sector employment. This policy, the OECD
argues, 'serves only to manifest the problem in a different form: instead of
being working poor, unskilled workers are unemployed.'
It also means that many women who would have entered employment in the 1980s
have not been able to do so. Seventy per cent of the new jobs created in the
EC in the second half of the 1980s went to new entrants to the labour market
while only 30 per cent were taken by the unemployed. But female employment
rates remain much higher in the US and the UK than in continental Europe,
while, with the sole exception of the UK, unemployment rates in Europe are
higher for women than for men.
EC officials acknowledge that the balance has swung too far towards
employment protection rather than creation. 'The inability of firms to hire
and fire can be a problem in some parts of the Community,' says Mr John
Morley, head of the Commission's employment policy unit. He lists high
non-wage labour costs and employment taxes in some parts of the Community,
inadequate training provision and the rigid working hours arrangements as
possible reasons for this poor record of job creation.
OECD officials say that European governments have so far only paid
lip-service to the need for more flexible labour markets. In particular,
they complain that too little effort has been made in switching employment
spending from 'passive' measures - unemployment benefits - to 'active' ones
such as counselling and retraining.
But this failure goes to the root of the EC's dilemma. It may be wasteful to
pay unemployment benefits to the growing army of long-term unemployed. But
the US alternative - falling real wages for the unskilled, greater
inequality and lower welfare benefits - can hardly be more palatable to EC
governments.

EC COUNTRIES, facing further increases in unemployment during the next year,
are implementing a mixture of shorter and longer term moves to try to keep
the rises to a minimum. Often, however, the governments know the measures
are little more than palliatives.
Everyone agrees there are no simple answers. As the Bank for International
Settlements put it in its annual report this month: 'Especially in
continental Europe, where 40 to 50 per cent of the unemployed have been
without work for 12 months or more, unemployment constitutes a structural
problem which cannot easily be resolved through higher output growth.'
The EC Commission recognises that, to make even a modest dent in the
Community's 17m unemployment total, labour market deregulation needs to be
near the top of the agenda.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has carefully avoided suggesting
the Maastricht treaty's social chapter contributes to joblessness. But the
Commission's new strategy on unemployment unveiled during the last few weeks
pinpoints high labour costs as an important factor.
In particular, the Commission has suggested unemployment could be brought
down through reductions in employers' social security contributions.
The cost to national exchequers of direct measures to alleviate unemployment
is relatively small in terms of the EC's overall spending on social
security. But, including indirect effects, rising unemployment has had a
considerable impact in increasing overall EC social transfers to an
estimated 19.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 15.8 per
cent in 1980, according to OECD figures.
Social transfers (including medical and pensions payouts as well as other
forms of social security) have risen during this period to 14.5 per cent
from 11.0 per cent for the UK, to 21.0 per cent from 17.0 per cent for
Germany, to 22.5 per cent from 19.2 per cent for France and to 18.9 per cent
from 14.2 per cent for Italy.
According to the OECD, most EC countries spend between 1 and 3 per cent of
GDP on 'active' and 'passive' labour market programmes. 'Active' measures
are classified as various forms of training, youth employment measures,
subsidised employment and the like, whereas 'passive' spending comprises
unemployment benefit and early retirement pay-outs.
In the 'active' category, Ireland, Denmark and Germany lead the league table
with spending put at 1.48, 1.39 and 1.21 per cent of GDP respectively. In
'passive' measures, Denmark heads the list with 4.72 per cent, followed by
Ireland (2.83) and Belgium (2.71).
The UK comes near the bottom of both lists with spending of 0.56 per cent of
GDP on 'active' measures and 1.35 per cent on 'passive' ones.
Since 1985, governments have moved away from direct job creation towards
more targeted measures aimed at mobilising labour supply for productive
work.
Success has, however been only limited. Employment creation in such
countries as France or Spain has slowed sharply in spite of buoyant economic
growth in the latter half of the 1980s.
In view of forecasts that French unemployment, already more than 3m, will
rise by a further 300,000 this year, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, has recently been forced to expand the scope of planned employment
creation measures. He has also appealed to French industry to offer a
further 200,000 apprenticeships and training posts to take more young people
off the dole queue.
The Netherlands offers an instructive example of how generous welfare
benefits can impede labour market schemes. The country focuses efforts to
combat unemployment on providing training and work experience. For people up
to the age of 27, the government offers guarantees of work experience at
public and non-profit institutions. However, only 7,200 people take part.
For the long-term unemployed, there are 'job pools' that offer mainly
unskilled work experience in hospitals, schools and other public bodies.
About 14,000 people participate.
In both cases, participants get paid little more than they would receive
under the Netherlands' generous welfare benefits - so that participation
rates are inevitably low.
As continental Europe confronts the realities of the recession, the greatest
financial squeeze is being felt by Germany. The federal labour office warned
last week that its deficit could rise to DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) this year, with
spending climbing to over DM100bn, up DM13bn from the 1993 budget.
Over DM11bn was spent on job creation schemes with DM9bn channelled to east
Germany.
The labour office also spent DM9.7bn in early retirement programmes whereby
55-year-old workers receive their full wages for five years, until the
normal retirement age.
Measures to make the labour market more flexible are being proposed with
much greater urgency. Mr Julius Louwen, a Christian Democrat parliamentary
deputy, has drafted 13 recommendations on which the federal labour ministry
is working.
In Spain, labour market inflexibility is also a growing preoccupation. Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, is starting discussions with trade
union leaders on a social pact aimed at bringing wages under control.
Mr Gonzalez is also trying to gain trade union agreement to less rigid
guidelines on job classification, on labour mobility and on short term
contracts.
Perhaps the most painful task in Europe awaits Italy. No government in Rome
since the 1950s has envisaged a long recession or imagined chronic
unemployment being a serious problem. As a result there is no welfare state
concept of unemployment benefit - merely a system of funding temporary
lay-offs for up to two years, so that workers can return to their jobs once
the production cycle picks up.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: Don't blame the service economy .. -
Why is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US
or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors?  / FT writers
report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit

<TEXT>
IN A REGION as large and diverse as the EC, it is risky to generalise about
unemployment. Whatever the headline figure, the patterns vary widely between
countries and economic sectors. But one basic fact needs to be taken into
account. The jobless total is not just the product of recent events such as
recession and German unification. Europe's unemployment has been rising for
decades.
At the peak of the economic cycle in 1979, EC unemployment stood at 5.4 per
cent. At the next peak in 1990 it was 8.3 per cent. In the US and Japan,
this pattern is reversed. Between the two cyclical peaks the rate fell.
It is tempting to attribute this to the relative decline of European
industry. In most EC countries, the industrial workforce has been falling
for years. Recently another phenomenon has been added: a shake-out of jobs
in service sectors such as banking and finance.
The resulting argument has a certain instinctive appeal. European industry,
it is said, is being priced out of work by developing countries. Industry is
basic to the economy, and services depend on it. If services are deprived of
an industrial base, they are not robust enough to fill the jobs gap.
The argument does not quite fit the facts. Granted, there has been a marked
shift away from manufacturing over the years. The OECD calculates that in
1970, blue-collar workers outnumbered white-collar workers in all 12 EC
states except the UK, Germany and Holland. By 1990, white-collar workers
were in the majority in every country except Spain.
But the same shift has happened elsewhere, notably Japan. The steady fall in
industrial employment is common to most developed countries, as a
consequence of factory automation. Provided industrial output carries on
rising, a falling level of industrial employment need not damage the economy
as a whole. In the EC, 62 per cent of jobs are now in services. But in the
US, where unemployment is lower, the figure is 72 per cent.
Nor is it true that services have failed to provide employment. In the
decade 1981-91, the EC lost 3.1m jobs in industry. In the same period,
farming lost 3.3m jobs. Employment in services rose by 14.9m, producing a
net increase in jobs of 8.5m. Unfortunately, this was more than offset by a
rise of 12m in the EC workforce; but that can hardly be blamed on the
service sector.
But recent employment trends in services are slightly worrying. It used to
be argued that productivity gains were harder to obtain in services than in
manufacturing, since no amount of automation could do much to improve the
output of a barber or a lawyer. Recent events in the UK, for instance, have
put that in question. BT made 35,000 workers redundant last year, 19,000 of
them on a single day. The main retail banks lost 10,000 workers, partly
because hole-in-the-wall cash machines replaced cashiers at the counter.
But the trend should not be exaggerated. As the OECD remarks, while the
service sector has been hit harder in this recession than in previous ones,
the worst job losses have still come in manufacturing and construction. And
if there are more white-collar workers out of work now than in previous
recessions, that is simply because there are more of them around than
before.
On the other hand, that fact helps to explain one curious aspect of the
present recession in regional terms. In previous recessions, the worst-hit
regions within countries were regularly those with the highest unemployment
to start with. In this recession the opposite is true. The accompanying map,
compiled from the latest comparative data from last year, illustrates the
trend.
In the two years to end-1991, according to OECD calculations, the
unemployment rate in UK regions with the lowest rate to start with rose by 4
percentage points. In those with the highest starting rate it rose 1.5
percentage points. Regional differentials have been compressed in this
recession, where previously they had widened. In the UK's case, the reason
is obvious: that a disproportionate number of jobs were lost in financial
services in London and south-east England.
Again, though, generalising about regions or countries is dangerous.
Portugal, for instance, should logically be suffering badly. At the start of
the 1980s it had 28 per cent of its workforce in the most endangered sector
of all, agriculture. Sure enough, by 1991 its farm workforce had plunged by
a quarter. But its industrial employment had risen by 15 per cent and jobs
in services by 65 per cent. Portugal's unemployment rate is now 6 per cent,
compared to 21 per cent in Spain.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Bosnia leader to be pressed on settlement: Owen sees five

EC FOREIGN ministers will hold talks with Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Alia
Izetbegovic, in Copenhagen today as pressure mounts on the Moslems to accept
Serb and Croat territorial gains in the war-ravaged republic.
The talks  - which coincide with the opening-day of the EC summit  - come as
the Community strives to salvage something from the wreckage of the
Vance-Owen plan for a Bosnian peace settlement.
Mr Izetbegovic, who asked for the meeting with EC ministers, has opposed
recent Serb and Croat proposals for dividing Bosnia on ethnic lines.
At an emergency meeting of EC foreign ministers last night, several EC
delegations voiced objections to any EC move towards partition of Bosnia.
But after the tense discussions, Lord Owen, the EC peace mediator, and Mr
Niels Helvig Petersen, Denmark's foreign minister, made clear that time was
running out for the Bosnian Moslems to reach a political settlement.
Lord Owen said he expected new guidelines for land-swaps between the Croats,
Serbs and Bosnian Moslems to be issued this week by EC leaders and Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. He would put these to the
presidents of Serbia and Croatia.
Lord Owen acknowledged that these guidelines would be less generous to the
Moslems than those under the Vance-Owen plan, which he drew up along with
the former UN mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance. But he said the best the EC could do
was to try to help Mr Izetbegovic by threatening economic sanctions against
Croatia and tougher economic pressure on Serbia.
Lord Owen presented foreign ministers with an outline map which provided for
five autonomous provinces within the existing Bosnian state. The plan, which
provides for some Serb withdrawals, would involve the creation of two Croat,
two Moslem and one Serb province.
The Moslems would need guaranteed access to the Adriatic and to the River
Danube.
Lord Owen said that conditions inside Bosnia were so desperate for the
civilian population that there had to be a negotiated settlement. But he
added: 'There has to be roll-back (of territorial gains).'
Senior British officials cautioned that this plan would have to be agreed by
all parties and was still in its early stages.
Mr Vance, now in the US, described recent peace moves as a 'tragic mistake'
that would 'end up rewarding those involved in ethnic cleansing'.

<TEXT>
REBEL Serb leaders from Croatia said yesterday that their weekend referendum
on the union of their self-styled state with other Serb-held territory was
the 'final act' towards the creation of a new Serb state.
Elsewhere, Sarajevo radio reported fierce fighting between Croat and mainly
Moslem Bosnian troops in four towns in central Bosnia as United Nations
commanders played down the threat by a Moslem commander in Tuzla, the
north-eastern industrial city, to unleash toxic chlorine to 'neutralise all
living forces in almost all Europe'.
Local officials of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), Serb-held
territory which covers about a third of Croatia, yesterday confirmed a high
turnout for the two-day poll.
The overwhelming majority was expected to vote Yes on union with Srpska
Republika, the self-proclaimed Serb state in Bosnia, with the option to
unite later with Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining members of Yugoslavia.
The RSK comprises three enclaves of Croatian territory seized by rebel Serbs
during Croatia's 1991 war of independence from former Yugoslavia.
Mr Milan Babic, the mayor of Knin, the stronghold of the RSK, said: 'This is
the final act of carrying out the people's will. The rest is up to the
politicians.' The referendum was held amid warnings by Serb leaders that
Croatia would cross UN lines to prevent the vote. Mr Nikica Valentic,
Croatian prime minister, said Zagreb would not intervene to stop the
referendum, and called for a diplomatic solution to the Krajina question.
Meanwhile, a 10-lorry UN convoy carrying food and medicine yesterday headed
for Gorazde, one of six UN-designated safe areas, and the UN resumed its
humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo.
Mr Milan Panic, former Yugoslav prime minister, arrived in Belgrade
yesterday to meet Serbian opposition leaders, aides said, Reuter reports
from Belgrade. His return on a visit from the US coincides with an outcry in
Serbia and abroad over the police beating and arrest of Mr Vuk Draskovic,
opposition leader. Mr Panic is seen in Serbia as the only serious contender
for power against President Slobodan Milosevic.

GREECE and Macedonia have been given another three months by the United
Nations to solve their dispute over finding a new name for the former
Yugoslav republic, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The two countries are expected to hold direct talks on the issue as well as
on confidence-building measures that will guarantee Macedonia access to the
Greek port of Thessaloniki, its nearest outlet to the sea, and allow
Macedonian citizens to visit Greece.
Because of their respective leaders' domestic problems, Greek and Macedonian
officials last month agreed at secret talks held in parallel with
negotiations at the UN to reject a UN compromise proposal on the name,
according to diplomatic sources.
The UN's new September deadline grants a breathing space both for Mr
Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, and President Kiro
Gligorev of Macedonia, who is under pressure from his country's nationalist
faction not to compromise on the name.
Mr Mitsotakis faces such stiff opposition from his New Democracy party over
the government's economic policy that his one-seat parliamentary majority
could be overturned if he agrees to 'Nova Makedonija', the name proposed by
Mr Cyrus Vance, the former UN mediator.
Both Mr Mitsotakis's party and a large section of the Greek population
object to the neighbouring republic's use of the name Macedonia on the
grounds that it implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province
of the same name.
There is less urgency on Macedonia's part to resolve the dispute since its
admission in April to the UN under a temporary name, the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, ended more than a year of diplomatic and economic
isolation.

THE European Community was last night struggling to salvage something from
the wreckage of its Bosnian peace plan as Lord Owen urged it to focus its
efforts on the creation of a 'viable mini-state' for the Bosnian Moslems.
Meeting on the eve of today's Copenhagen summit, EC foreign ministers heard
a call from the Community's peace envoy for a determined effort to end the
war in the former Yugoslav republic before the winter.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alia Izetbegovic will fly to Copenhagen today for
talks with EC ministers about the latest efforts to agree a peace
settlement.
Lord Owen indicated to ministers that the international community had no
choice but to acknowledge, if not condone, the realities imposed by Serbian
aggression. He said pressure on Serbia and Croatia should now be directed
towards securing a viable state for the Moslems.
He said the EC should strengthen his hand in this week's resumed Geneva
peace talks by agreeing to keep sanctions in place until such a deal was
agreed by Serbian and Croatian forces.
The new Moslem state would need guaranteed access to the Adriatic and to the
River Danube  - a guarantee that the EC should underwrite by, if necessary,
threatening Croatia with the imposition of economic sanctions.
Lord Owen's comments  - marking public recognition that the Vance-Owen plan
for a multi-ethnic Bosnian republic cannot be resurrected  - left EC leaders
with the unenviable task of packaging the failure of the strategy launched
two years ago in Luxembourg.
The peace envoy, who saw any remaining hopes for the original Vance-Owen
plan undercut by last week's partition deal in Geneva between Serbia and
Croatia, admitted the creation of a Bosnian republic for the Moslems would
leave Serbia with the rewards of aggression.
But he said: 'You can't hold out for the ideal when you are not going to get
it. . . This thing has got to be settled. The war has got to be brought to
an end before the winter'.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday voiced the fears
of several leaders that public recognition of Bosnian partition would create
'unimaginable' precedents.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, defended the EC's role in
Bosnia and said the Community would focus on new methods to prevent a
recurrence of the conflict in former Yugoslavia.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Lombard League wins Milan race
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE populist Lombard League last night confirmed its hold on the voters of
northern Italy by winning the mayoral election for Milan.
The run-off in the second round of partial municipal elections throughout
Italy also confirmed the strength of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS). The Christian Democrats and the Socialists  - the
dominant parties over the past decade  - are the principal losers.
Exit polls and partial counting of votes showed that the Lombard League's
candidate, Mr Marco Formentini, scored a clear victory in the northern
industrial city of Milan.
Mr Formentini notched up about 55-57 per cent of the vote in the second
round. In the earlier round, on June 6, he had won nearly 39 per cent of the
vote and polls during the past week consistently put him ahead.
Nevertheless, his opponent in the run-off, Mr Nando Dalla Chiesa, had put up
a strong showing backed by a leftist alliance headed by the PDS.
'The game is over,' said Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's rough-and-tumble
leader. 'What happened today is a strong signal that the country wants
change. . . . If the League wins, change wins.'
The League's victory in Milan underlines the north's desire for new
political blood and a radical approach to municipal politics in the wake of
widespread corruption scandals.
In the other big northern industrial city of Turin the PDS candidate, Mr
Valentino Castellani, came from behind and easily topped his rival, Mr Diego
Novelli, a former Turin mayor who was supported by a rival group of leftist
parties.
The PDS did well, according to exit polls, in most of the 145 municipalities
where there was a second round contest for mayor. This was the first time
under new laws approved in March that Italy has carried out direct elections
for mayors, who now have the right to choose 60 per cent of municipal
councils and thus ensure stable local government.
The Lombard League has vowed to contest the results of first-round voting in
Turin and a regional appeal court will consider its case next week. This
could lead to the Turin election being annulled.

<TEXT>
THE Uffizi Gallery in Florence was partially reopened yesterday only 23 days
after one wing was seriously damaged by a car bomb blast that also killed a
family of five, Robert Graham writes from Rome.
Mr Alberto Ronchey, the culture minister, cut through Italy's bureaucracy,
obtained L30bn (Pounds 13.3m) in funds and encouraged volunteer help in
order to open the world-famous gallery to the public as soon as possible.
The damaged wing and its paintings will require up to another six months of
restoration, but Mr Ronchey insisted on this first step to show that Italy
would not be intimidated by terrorist violence.
The authorities have yet to identify those responsible for the car bomb. But
they continue to insist the Mafia was involved.
The blast in Florence was preceded by a few days by a car bomb in Rome aimed
at a television talk show journalist, the first such incident in the capital
and again thought to be the work of the Mafia. However, there is suspicion
that elements of the security services - long linked to right-wing extremist
groups and the secret Masonic lodge P2 - might be involved.

<TEXT>
MOST Americans still feel that President Bill Clinton is not a strong
leader, but their support for Mr Ross Perot, the outspoken Clinton critic,
is also slipping, according to a new national poll, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The poll of 1,000 registered voters, conducted for US News and World Report
magazine, showed 68 per cent of those responding rated the president's
leadership capabilities as fair or poor.
Mr Clinton has done poorly in virtually all similar polls in recent months
and has been attacked sharply on his economic programme by Mr Perot, a Texas
billionaire and unsuccessful independent candidate for the White House last
year.
But the latest poll also showed that only 54 per cent of respondents had a
favourble impression of Mr Perot, against 67 per cent a month ago.
More Americans (37 per cent) had an unfavourable impression of Mr Perot than
they did in May (26 per cent). But 59 per cent said he should continue to
hold Mr Clinton accountable for what is right for the country, while 30 per
cent felt he was being too critical of the president.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Bundesbank in firing line over rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN monetary policy makers are becoming increasingly disenchanted with
the Bundesbank's refusal to lower Germany's interest rates and are
questioning whether the European monetary system can continue to survive in
its present form.
In meetings last week, officials criticised the central bank for its high
interest rates and for taking too optimistic a view of German growth and
employment prospects in the second half of this year.
The bank's policies were queried when officials from the leading industrial
countries met last Tuesday in the secretive Working Party Three committee at
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.
Concern was expressed earlier among officials attending the annual meeting
last week of the Bank for International Settlements that Germany's high
interest rates could lead to conflicts among members of the European
exchange rate mechanism and possibly to a new crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
One central bank official said: 'What we're seeing now replicates what
happened in the early 1970s when the Bretton Woods system (of fixed global
exchange rates) was breaking up. We are trying our hardest to patch up the
existing system, though thinking all the time we may not succeed.'
Some central bankers wonder whether the ERM will have to be replaced by a
more flexible system of exchange rate stewardship which allows currencies to
fluctuate by wider margins against each other.
Behind such thoughts are:
The reduced role of the D-Mark as the ERM anchor. With the D-Mark having
declined substantially against other currencies, faith in the Bundesbank as
the arbiter of interest rates throughout Europe is starting to wane.
Increased power of financial markets. Semi-fixed exchange rates may be
harder to defend against the ability of the Dollars 1,000bn-a-day currency
market to switch money around the world in response to changing perceptions
about policy or events such as elections.
Likely reluctance by governments to shift ERM parities when under pressure.
Since last year's turbulence, European governments have stepped up efforts
to discuss how economic fluctuations affect currencies, with a view to
anticipating the need for devaluations. However, one central bank official
said: 'A devaluation will still be seen as a political defeat, no matter how
great the discussion beforehand.'
Lack of credibility in the ERM, with the pound and the Italian lira
operating outside the mechanism after last year's strains. Neither of these
currencies appear likely to re-enter in the immediate future.
In public, central bankers say they are generally confident that the ERM is
working well.
Mr Maurice Doyle, governor of Ireland's central bank, says further
realignments are unlikely over the next one to two years on the grounds that
'everything seems to be in equilibrium'.
However, German policy and the recent decline in the D-Mark on foreign
exchange markets are causing alarm elsewhere. Although some analysts expect
that figures this week will show a slowdown in the growth of German broad
money, there are fears the German authorities will continue to resist any
further easing of monetary policy because of the weak D-Mark.
That would put new strains on the ERM where France, in particular, would
like to lower interest rates to revive its economy and quell criticism of
rising unemployment and the link between the franc and the D-Mark.
Although French money market rates have been cut below German levels, the
authorities in Paris are unwilling to approve a sharp easing of monetary
policy without the Bundesbank moving first.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S legislative crackdown on crime and clandestine immigration has
provoked a backlash from two powerful centrist ministers.
Mr Pierre Mehaignerie and Mrs Simone Veil, UDF ministers of justice and
social affairs respectively, have written to Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, to ask for government support in deleting an amendment which would
let police demand identity papers of people they have 'any reason, apart
from racial appearance, to believe are foreign'.
The police powers bill of Mr Charles Pasqua, hard-line Gaullist interior
minister, now before parliament, has widened the scope of police to make
spot identity checks, but not to the extent the amendment's supporters would
like.
He appeared to indicate yesterday that he had no quarrel with the backbench
Gaullist amendment, simply saying it was up to the Senate to decide what to
do.
Officials said yesterday that Mr Balladur would seek, on his return from the
EC summit in Copenhagen, to defuse the row. The two UDF ministers said in
their letter it was 'important for law-abiding foreigners not to feel
discriminated against'.
A 10,000-strong protest march, by left-wing and immigrant organisations
opposed to the bill, was held in Paris at the weekend.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Temporary permits for workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is to introduce a system of seasonal work permits in
an attempt to have more control over illegal immigrant labour.
This is the first time an EC state has opted to experiment on a large scale
with temporary work permits.
The move follows months of study of illicit immigration in Italy and the
demands for legally imported labour. The authorities concluded the bulk of
some 1.2m non-EC workers now in the country entered initially for seasonal
work.
Under the decree the government will establish a six-month permit. On expiry
holders will be obliged to leave the country. However, they will be able to
register their wish to return and would be eligible to do so the following
year.
Having obtained two permits in consecutive years, the non-EC worker would be
entitled to apply for a one-year work permit provided he or she is in
possession of a valid job offer.
Those with valid seasonal permits will be entitled to social security
benefits, including maternity care.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Reforms hit European drugs industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S pharmaceuticals industry continued to suffer the effects of
healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy during the first third of the year.
Drugs sales in Europe's seven largest markets fell from Dollars 16.65bn in
the four months to April 1992 to Dollars 15.66bn (Pounds 10.4bn) during the
same period this year.
The figures, compiled by the pharmaceuticals market research company IMS
International, were affected by the devaluations of a number of European
currencies.
In local currencies, sales in the seven countries increased 1.4 per cent,
compared with 8 per cent in the whole of 1992. The seven markets represent
about 85 per cent of the west European market.
France overtook Germany as the world's third largest market, as drugs sales
increased from Dollars 3.93bn during the first four months in 1992 to
Dollars 4.23bn during the same period this year, an increase of 7.2 per cent
excluding currencies.
The German market, hit by a 5 per cent price cut in January and the
introduction of curbs on doctors' prescribing, fell from Dollars 4.67bn to
Dollars 4.17bn, a drop of 11 per cent excluding currencies.
The figures include sales in eastern Germany.
Italian sales fell 0.6 per cent in the local currency after health reforms
this year. They dropped from Dollars 3.76bn to Dollars 2.97bn.
The UK posted a drop from Dollars 1.71bn to Dollars 1.62bn, but excluding
currencies it reported a gain of 11.6 per cent. Spanish sales fell from
Dollars 1.62bn to Dollars 1.61bn, but generated a 13.2 per cent rise in
local currencies.
The Dutch market was the fastest-growing among the seven, rising from
Dollars 461m to Dollars 530m, an increase of 14.4 per cent excluding
exchange rates. Sales in Belgium increased from Dollars 499m to Dollars
529m, a rise of 5.9 per cent in local currencies.
In dollar terms, all therapeutic categories reported a drop in sales except
for anti-infectives, which include anti-viral and anti-fungal treatments.
These increased from Dollars 1.61bn to Dollars 1.62bn.
Excluding exchange rates, sales of anti-infectives rose 9.5 per cent,
alimentary and metabolism treatments increased 0.4 per cent, central nervous
system drugs rose 4.1 per cent, and respiratory medicines, mainly asthma
medicines, rose 5.9 per cent.
All figures include purchases by pharmacies, representing about 80 per cent
of total drugs sales. They exclude end-users such as hospitals.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Turn-out down in Italian cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOTER turn-out yesterday, in the run-off to elect mayors in 145 Italian
cities, looked set to be lower than in the first round.
This suggested that a proportion of the 6.7m voters had decided to stay
away, unwillng to endorse either candidate in each run-off.
By early evening, only 32 per cent of the potential electorate had voted,
compared to 38 per cent in the first round on June 6.
This is the first time that Italy has used new laws, approved in March,
introducing the direct election of mayors. In only two instances did the
first round yield absolute majorities; the other cities were obliged to try
again.
The main interest yesterday was in the outcome in the two big northern
cities of Milan and Turin. The populist Lombard League of Mr Umberto Bossi
has staked its prestige on being able to win Milan outright.
Mr Marco Formentini, League candidate, obtained the largest vote in the
first round, with nearly 39 per cent. Opinion polls have suggested he is
ahead of his rival, Mr Nando Dalla Chiesa, supported by a broad alliance of
the left, who won 30 per cent in the first round.
The final stages of the campaign were marred by provocative statements from
Mr Bossi, directed against Mr Dalla Chiesa and his supporters.
The League has also been vociferous in Turin, where it claims the first
round vote was irregular, depriving its candidate of the chance of a
run-off.
The run-off in Turin yesterday could yet be annulled as the League has
sought an injunction. This suit is unlikely to be heard before next week.
The contest in Turin is between two candidates of the left - Mr Diego
Novelli, a former communist mayor, and Mr Diego Castellani, candidate of the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
The once-dominant Christian Democratic party is in only five out of 16 of
the most important mayoral contests. This underlines its waning fortunes.
By contrast, the Christian Democrats' old rivals, the communists now
transformed into the PDS, could turn a system of alliances into a large
number of mayoral wins.

FT  21 JUN 93 / EC concedes Bosnia plan is in tatters: Lord Owen urges a
'viable mini-state' for Moslems

<TEXT>
THE European Community was last night struggling to salvage something from
the wreckage of its Bosnian peace plan as Lord Owen urged it to focus its
efforts on the creation of a 'viable mini-state' for the Bosnian Moslems.
Meeting on the eve of today's Copenhagen summit, EC foreign ministers heard
a call from the Community's peace envoy for a determined effort to end the
war in the former Yugoslav republic before the winter.
Accepting that the international community had no choice but to acknowledge,
if not condone, the realities imposed by Serbian aggression, Lord Owen said
pressure on Serbia and Croatia should now be directed towards securing a
viable state for the Moslems.
He said the EC should strengthen his hand in this week's resumed Geneva
peace talks by agreeing to keep sanctions in place until such a deal was
agreed by Serbian and Croatian forces.
The new Moslem state would have to guaranteed access to the Adriatic and to
the River Danube - a guarantee that the EC should underwrite by, if
necessary, threatening Croatia with the imposition of economic sanctions.
Lord Owen's comments - marking public recognition that the Vance-Owen plan
for a multi-ethnic Bosnian republic cannot be resurrected - left EC leaders
with the unenviable task of packaging the failure of the strategy launched
two years ago at a similar summit in Luxembourg.
The peace envoy, who saw any remaining hopes for the original Vance-Owen
plan undercut by last week's partition deal in Geneva between Serbia and
Croatia, admitted the creation of a Bosnian republic for the Moslems would
leave Serbia with the rewards of aggression.
But he said: 'You can't hold out for the ideal when you are not going to get
it. . . This thing has got to be settled. The war has got to be brought to
an end before the winter'.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday voiced the fears
of several leaders that public recognition of the partition of Bosnia would
create 'unimaginable' precedents.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, defended the EC's role in
Bosnia and said the Community would focus on new methods to prevent a
recurrence of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, such as preventive
diplomacy and an 'early warning system' as suggested by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general.

FT  21 JUN 93 / ERM should be reorganised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European exchange rate mechanism should be reorganised with wider
currency fluctuation bands so that members can have scope to follow
differing monetary and fiscal policies, a British bank economist has
suggested, Peter Norman writes.
Mr Patrick Foley, chief economic adviser at Lloyds Bank, said ERM countries
would be better able to achieve economic convergence if exchange rate bands
were widened to perhaps 10 per cent either side of their central rates, from
the present 2.25 per cent.
The planned European Monetary Institute (EMI) should be given the task of
determining central rates in the new wider bands by assessing underlying
economic fundamentals in the ERM countries, he said. The EMI, which is due
to have a co-ordinating role for monetary policy when stage two of the
Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union begins in January, could
also orchestrate regular 'inflation realignments' to keep real exchange
rates in the ERM relatively constant.
Mr Foley's proposals would change the ERM into a 'crawling peg' currency
system from one of fixed but adjustable exchange rates.

<TEXT>
THE FIRST Channel tunnel express train to be seen in Britain emerged from
the tunnel mouth at Folkestone yesterday morning  - crawling behind a French
diesel locomotive that had pulled it through the tunnel, writes Richard
Tomkins.
The electrically powered train, built in France, was unable to make its own
way to British shores because the electrical systems in the tunnel have not
yet been switched on.
A total of 38 Eurostar Channel tunnel express trains are being built by GEC
Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company, at Pounds 24m apiece. They
will run between London and Paris in three hours when the tunnel opens next
year.
The prototype that arrived yesterday has undergone months of trials in
France and will be tested in England to establish how the trains perform
using the comparatively low-voltage electrical system in use on Network
SouthEast.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Japan's LDP tries to halt defections to new parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party was fighting yesterday to keep its
parliamentary members from defecting, as two centrist groups planned new
parties for the July 18 election, which may end four decades of LDP
government.
Senior LDP officials conceded that the party might be defeated at the
election, called after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, lost a
no-confidence motion on Friday when a rebel faction voted against the party.
The political upheaval is expected to dominate Japanese financial markets
this week after Friday's 2 1/2 per cent drop in the value of the yen against
the dollar. The stock market opened weaker this morning, with the Nikkei
average down about 300 points in initial trading. The yen opened at Y109.33
against the dollar, after closing in New York on Friday at Y109.75.
Analysts are uncertain whether the possibility of the LDP losing its
38-year-old hold on power means the end of the yen's bull run, which has
seen a 16 per cent rise in the Japanese currency against the dollar this
year.
While braced for short-term weakness ahead of the election, they point out
that Japan's huge trade surplus is deep-rooted and still favours the yen.
Sensing that the LDP is more vulnerable than at any time since 1955, the
Social Democratic party, the largest opposition group, said a coalition
government could be formed with LDP defectors if they succeed in attracting
voter support.
The LDP decided to hold the election as soon as possible, believing that the
new groups will find it difficult in the time allotted to choose candidates
and raise funds for an effective campaign. Party officials were also
conscious that the trial for tax evasion of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former LDP
godfather, begins on July 22.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, whose LDP faction brought down the government, is expected
to announce his resignation from the party tomorrow and the formation of a
new party a day later. He hopes to put forward at least 170 candidates for
the 512 seats to be contested in the election.
'It's important to put an end to one-party rule  - that's one part of
political reform which could create dynamism,' Mr Hata said, referring to
the LDP's possible defeat. He also defended himself against criticism that
he had tarnished the country's reputation by triggering an election at a
time when Japan is preparing to host a Group of Seven summit, due to begin
on July 7.
Mr Hata said the LDP chose to provoke the upheaval by failing to address
political reform, especially the redrawing of electoral boundaries and
tougher controls on donations intended to clean up Japanese politics.
The scent of a share in government has encouraged the SDP, which has
languished in opposition without any real chance of leading the country. Mr
Sadao Yamahana, the SDP's chairman, said his party is willing to share power
with a new Hata-led party.
LDP members fear they will be punished by voters next month, a fear also
reflected among candidates for Tokyo city council elections to be held on
Sunday.
Apart from Mr Hata, a second group of 10 LDP members belonging to the
Mitsuzuka faction is planning to form a new party.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Nadir's donation may be returned, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, ANDREW JACK and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR signalled last night that the Tory party was seriously
considering returning the Pounds 440,000 donated by Mr Asil Nadir.
His comments came amid growing pressure on Mr Michael Mates, the junior
minister linked to Mr Nadir, to resign, threatening a fresh crisis for the
government.
Speaking to journalists on his arrival in Copenhagen for the European
Community summit, the prime minister appeared to suggest that the failure by
the fugitive businessman to declare the donations in company accounts could
be sufficient reason for their return.
In an attempt to defuse the mounting furore, Mr Major reinforced Tory
officials' pledges that the money would be returned to the administrators of
Polly Peck if it was proved to have been dishonestly obtained or remitted by
Mr Nadir.
'Any money that was dishonestly obtained and dishonestly donated to the
Conservative party is not wanted by the Conservative party,' he said. 'If it
is proved to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us,
then of course we will return it.'
But while stressing his determination that his party should act properly, Mr
Major refused to comment on the future of Mr Mates, the security minister at
the Northern Ireland office.
Support for Mr Mates among Tory MPs fell rapidly at the weekend, and senior
MPs voiced concern that he may have to resign amid the failure of the party
hierarchy to stop continuing controversy over the support given to Mr Nadir
by Conservatives before he fled to northern Cyprus.
Senior Whitehall officials acknowledged that it had been 'unwise' of Mr
Mates to accept the loan of a car from Mr Nadir's public relations advisers.
His future is expected to be raised when the powerful 1922 executive of Tory
backbench MPs meets on Thursday. One member, among the most pessimistic
about Mr Mates's chances of survival, said yesterday: 'I doubt whether he
will last that long.'
A resignation would be a further embarrassment for Mr Major who has only
just recovered from the fallout after Mr Norman Lamont's sacking as
chancellor. Even Tory MPs who are suggesting that Mr Mates may have to go
accept that it would be another example of Mr Major losing a minister after
media pressure.
Mr Mates was unavailable for comment yesterday. However, colleagues were
concerned at the impact of the row which began with revelations that Mr
Mates had raised with the Attorney General Mr Nadir's treatment by the
Serious Fraud Office.
The row over the Nadir donations has triggered calls from within the Tory
party for a wider review of how it sets out its accounts  - demands likely
to be reiterated when the Commons debates the funding of political parties
tomorrow.
Conservative Central Office said yesterday that Sir John Cope, former deputy
chairman and now Treasury minister, had written two years ago to liquidators
of Mr Nadir's business empire setting out the payments the party had
received from him.
However, it was still waiting to be told formally if the donations had been
from 'stolen money'.
Mr David Mellor, former cabinet minister, said one way of dealing with the
issue would be to recognise that the money would never appear a legitimate
donation  - however honourable it seemed at the time  - and send it back.
Administrators at accountants Touche Ross have traced a series of payments
totalling Pounds 365,000 during 1987-90 which were paid through a bank
account in Jersey of Unipac, the northern Cyprus-based packaging
manufacturer within the Polly Peck group.
Touche has also identified several payments totalling at least Pounds 75,000
in the period 1985-87 paid directly with funds from Polly Peck
International, the parent company. None of these political donations was
disclosed in the group accounts, although these details are required by the
law.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, seized on the latest twists in the
financing row to underline his demands that the Conservative party repay
immediately the money contributed by Mr Nadir. Mr Major should explain
publicly the 'very murky' circumstances in which funds were paid to the
Tories, he said.

FT  21 JUN 93 / Key pits face closure threat: British Coal executives expect
to shut mines on 'core list' within year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL executives expect within a year to have to close some of the 19
mines previously considered its core pits, fuelling the controversy about
the industry's future and adding to the government's political travails.
The 19 pits were given a future even last October, when 60 per cent of the
industry was earmarked for shutdown. Any closures would be in addition to
those among 12 collieries reprieved by the government in March after a
public outcry over the October plans.
The threat to some of the core pits came as Mr Arthur Scargill, president of
the National Union of Mineworkers, urged the Trades Union Congress to call a
special 24-hour strike by all workers in protest at pit closures and other
job losses.
And Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, warned that Britain could
not afford to waste miners' skills. Speaking at a Sheffield Cathedral
service marking the end of Coal Week, he appealed to the government to help
communities hit by pit closures.
'There is a sense of injustice and bitter anger in the affected mining
communities, and a wider disquiet among thinking people across party lines
as they watch the gates slamming on so much investment,' he said.
Last week British Coal re-awakened public debate over the future of the
industry when it set in motion procedures that may lead to the closure of
three of the 12 reprieved pits and indicated that others were at risk.
The threat of closures among the core pits stems from an even larger decline
in the likely mark-up for coal in the next few years than was envisaged in
October. That results from tighter environmental controls and the improved
efficiency of nuclear power plants.
In addition, British Coal executives say that some of the 19 are in danger
because of the improved performance of the best of the 12 reprieved pits.
'It would be difficult to justify closing any of the 12 if they were
outperforming what we had previously considered to be the core pits,' one
executive said yesterday.
British Coal would not speculate on the future of the 31 remaining
collieries, but executives spoke in private of the doubts surrounding the
19.
Ellington, in the north-east of England, is among the most vulnerable. A
report for the government this year by John T. Boyd, a US consultancy, said
it was one of the least efficient of the 19. Since then, the mine has fallen
short of production targets.
Troubles are greater still for three of the 12 pits that British Coal said
last week were encountering geological obstacles. Miners at Rufford in
Nottinghamshire agreed by a small majority on Friday to closure by the end
of the year.
British Coal said yesterday it was seeking the 'best solution' at Markham,
Derbyshire, after miners there decided on Saturday against taking a vote on
closure. Pitmen at Silverdale, in Staffordshire, are expected to meet this
week to decide which approach to adopt.
However, few British Coal executives expect Markham or Silverdale to be open
by the end of the year. Faced with a declining market, miners will be
tempted by enhanced redundancy terms on offer until December 31, executives
say.
For the rest of the industry, the crunch date is April 1 next year. From
then, electricity generators will buy only 30m tonnes of coal a year under
existing contracts, against 40m at present.

FT  21 JUN 93 / EC agrees on road charges for hauliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST liberalisation of the European Community road haulage market was
agreed late on Saturday night by transport ministers of the 12, filling in
one of the most gaping holes in the EC's single market.
Agreement on a common system of charging trucks for using EC roads unlocked
an accord by the 12 to phase in road cabotage  - allowing hauliers from one
member state to pick up and deliver goods within another member state.
National restrictions mean that about one in three EC trucks returns empty
after delivering its load, making a mockery of the single market's
proclaimed goal of free movement in goods and services and adding to
transport costs and road congestion. The deal means that hauliers will
increasingly be able to ply for trade throughout their trips across Europe,
a right confined at the moment to those possessing scarce licences covering
less than 1 per cent of the main national haulage markets.
The present level of 18,530 licences will be raised to 30,000 in January
next year. It will then be increased by 30 per cent annually until
unrestricted cabotage comes into effect on July 1 1998.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport minister, said as the deal was about to be
struck at midnight on Saturday: 'It's a bit late, but we've completed the
single market in transport.'
Mr Robert Coleman, head of the European Commission's transport directorate,
described the road transport package as 'the most difficult harmonisation
problem we have had to solve'.
The deal was made possible when Germany, the Benelux countries and Denmark
agreed on a common fee, or 'vignette', for trucks over 12 tonnes using their
motorways and principal roads.
Germany had refused to open its roads to outside competition until common
charging had been agreed. Bonn's attempt unilaterally to impose a DM9,000
(Pounds 3,600) annual road charge on non-German trucks was outlawed as
discriminatory by the European Court of Justice in May 1992.
On Saturday, the 12 agreed on a maximum annual road user's fee of Ecu1,250
 -around a quarter of the German level  - reviewable every two years. The
five countries that are going ahead with the system from January 1995 will
operate a regional 'vignette' to be displayed on the windscreens of trucks
using their road system.
Nine of the 12, including the UK, have already signalled their intention
eventually to introduce road charging, and Saturday's agreement also
encourages member states to bring in road user charges for cars.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, the German transport minister, hailed the agreement as
'a great breakthrough for Europe', reminding his colleagues that Germany
started pushing its partners on road charging in 1968. 'For the first time,
we will have a fair attribution of costs for trucks in Europe,' he said.
Germany will get 73 per cent of the proceeds from the vignette, with 13 per
cent going to Belgium, 9 per cent to the Netherlands, 4 per cent to Denmark
and 1 per cent to Luxembourg. Germany has said it intends to devote the
proceeds to modernising its railway infrastructure.
A daily charge of Ecu6 (Pounds 4.75) for infrequent road-users was also
agreed, beaten down from Ecu8 by peripheral countries including Greece,
Ireland and Portugal.
A weekly and monthly rate is to be agreed later. The road charge system is
part of a package aimed at making transport costs more equal, to prevent
unfair competitive advantage when cabotage comes into effect.

THE CAREER of Mr Michael Mates, the junior minister linked to Mr Asil Nadir,
was last night under threat as rapidly falling support for him among Tory
MPs threatened a fresh crisis for the government.
Senior Tory MPs voiced concern that Mr Mates may have to resign amid the

As a wider debate erupted with Tory ranks over the secrecy surrounding

GERRESHEIMER, the German glass manufacturer, is heading for an operating

Gunther Berger, chairman, said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes.
The company, which cut its 1992 dividend to DM5 from DM11 the year before
after net earnings fell two thirds to DM31m (Dollars 19m), has closed two
works so far this year. Provisions had already been made to cover the costs
of a further closure planned for later this year, Mr Berger told the annual

Turnover in the first six months, affected by recession and the closure of
two glass plants last autumn, fell 8 per cent to DM691m, he said.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Celsis expected to raise up to Pounds 20m
in flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIO-SCIENCE company that hopes to replace the 100-year-old agar plate
technology for detecting and identifying microbial contamination is due to
join the market next month through a placing and intermediaries offer.
Celsis has never made a profit and its digital testing product is still in
development. But the Cambridge Science Park company is expected to raise up
to Pounds 20m and have a market capitalisation of some Pounds 60m.
The group will be headed by Mr Tony Martin, chief executive, formerly a
director of British Bio-technology, and chaired by Mr John Precious, finance
director of Wellcome. The company's founders, Mr Chris Evans and Mr John
Morris, will become non-executive directors.
Celsis says its system can reduce the time taken to test and identify
microbes in medicines, food and cosmetics from up to a week to as little as
eight hours. The detection relies on bioluminescence - measurement of light
emitted when the firefly luciferase enzyme reacts with Adenosine
Triphosphate (ATP), which is contained in all living cells.
The company will use the net proceeds from the float - Pounds 13.5m if
Celsis raises Pounds 20m - for research and development and to set up a
marketing team and financial control systems.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Outspoken champion of manufacturing - Chris
Tighe on Crabtree's approach to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Britain's most vociferous champions of manufacturing industry will
see dealings start on Monday in the shares of Crabtree, the Gateshead-based
metal decorating printing press producer of which he is chairman.
Mr Karl Watkin has a reputation for outspokenness in criticising what he
sees as lack of government commitment to manufacturing. Legend has it that
he called Mr Peter Lilley a 'little pillock' when the hapless politician
toured Crabtree in his days as Trade and Industry secretary.
However, Mr Watkin, 37, whose maxim is 'shy boys get nowt' - has put his
effort where his mouth is. Since he and Mr Matt Cooper, his partner, staged
a Pounds 3.6m management buy-out of Crabtree from Vickers in 1986, they have
turned it from a company losing Pounds 8,000 a day into a profitable
exporter selling more than 80 per cent of output to more than 60 countries.
For Crabtree's flotation Mr Watkin has warranted that it will make Pounds 3m
pre-tax profit in the year ending September. Turnover is expected to be just
over Pounds 20m.
The company, which counts only Mailander of Germany and Dainippon Ink and
Chemicals of Japan as major competitors, designs, produces and installs
presses for decorating tinplate and aluminium. An estimated 1,500 machines
worldwide provide a profitable income stream from maintenance, repairs and
spares.
Crabtree's flotation, via a reversal into Somerset Trust, a quoted
investment trust, aims to fund acquisitions in the capital equipment sector.
Mr Watkin says: 'We're looking for a company with a substantial turnover,
Pounds 40m-Pounds 100m, currently washing its face, exporting, but with a
potential to be world class.'
Somerset's Pounds 19.4m acquisition of Crabtree, plus Pounds 1m of working
capital, consists of the issue of Pounds 5m shares to the vendors, plus
Pounds 8.4m of loan notes and a Pounds 6m cash payment.
Credit Lyonnais Laing's placing of 6.7m new ordinary shares at 150p each, to
raise Pounds 10m, was enthusiastically received by institutional investors.
The 3-for-1 rights issue of 3.6m shares, also at 150p each, to raise Pounds
5.4m, is fully underwritten by Hill Samuel. The Somerset EGM on Monday to
vote on the reverse takeover, under which the trust will be renamed Crabtree
Group, is expected to be a formality.
Mr Watkin, Mr Cooper and the other existing shareholder, Mr Richard Oury,
will hold 12.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively of the
enlarged share capital. Mr Stephen Hargrave and Mr Luke Johnson, who
acquired 29.9 per cent of Somerset last summer with a view to an acquisition
by reverse takeover, will have 2.5 per cent. Mr Watkin and Mr Cooper will
remain at the helm of a stren-gthened management team.
Recently, Mr Watkin launched a high-profile crusade, Manufacturing
Challenge, to urge north-east England manufacturers to double output and
treble exports over the next decade. The campaign signifies a shift in his
view of who is to blame for Britain's manufacturing decline - not only the
government and the banks, but all of us.
'It's just complacency. We've got too fat and lazy. We as a country haven't
got a culture that puts manufacturing at the forefront of our minds.'
What institutional investors will make of Mr Watkin's bluntness remains to
be seen. He acknowledges he now has investors to please but anticipates no
problem. 'I'm more than happy so far with what's been said to me by
institutional investors,' he says.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Dollars 1bn Morgan and Marsh fund will invest in Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the US bank, and Marsh McLennan, the world's largest insurance
broker, are planning to launch a Dollars 1bn insurance fund in the next few
weeks which will make significant investments in the Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
With SG Warburg, Morgan is one of two banks advising Lloyd's about the
introduction of corporate capital.
The project, known as the Trident Fund, will also make investments in the
insurance industry worldwide.
Lloyd's aims to complete a rulebook setting out the taxation, legal and
accounting treatment for corporate Names at the end of next month. It
emerged last week that it was hoping to attract as much as Pounds 500m in
corporate capital for the 1994 underwriting year.
Morgan and Marsh are already co-operating on the development of a Dollars
70m Bermuda-based fund that will reinsure Lloyd's syndicates managed by
Merrett Holdings, the Lloyd's agency.
In a separate development, insurers including Lloyd's syndicates have
claimed victory in a US pollution case following an appeal court ruling in
early June. The case was one of a series of lawsuits connected with dioxin
pollution in the Times Beach area of eastern Missouri.
International Petrochemical Corporation, a subsidiary of Charter Oil, sued
its insurers between 1971 and 1983 for the cost of cleaning up a number of
sites polluted in the early 1970s. The pollution arose when independent
contractors used waste oil from Charter Oil as an ingredient in a dust
suppressant, which was subsequently sprayed over several sites in the
eastern Missouri area.
The appeal court ruled this month that policies sold between 1978 and 1983
could not be claimed on. The court has still to rule on policies in force
between 1972 and 1977.
A Philadelphia court last month rejected an appeal by Texas Eastern
Transmission Company in a case in which the cost of pollution was estimated
at Dollars 750m.
Mr Stephen Tomlinson QC has been appointed to a new legal advisory panel
working on a potential out-of-court settlement to the litigation between
Lloyd's Names and their agents.
Lloyd's announced last month that Sir Michael Kerr, a former High Court
judge, would chair the panel. Simmons &amp; Simmons, the solicitors, will act as
a secretariat to the panel, which will advise on the strength of Names'
claims.
Mr Boyd has extensive experience of Lloyd's affairs. He sat on the
Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into Minet Holdings in the early
1980s and has chaired a Lloyd's disciplinary committee.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UN set to seize Somali warlord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS forces in Somalia were preparing yesterday to try to seize
the defiant warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed, in the wake of the
military blitz on his militia on Thursday.
But the streets of Mogadishu were quiet and UN officials appeared to
indicate a low-key approach to Gen Aideed after the turmoil and killings of
the past fortnight.
With his military stronghold destroyed in the UN action, Gen Aideed was
reported to be hiding with a group of his most loyal followers in a 'safe
house' in the capital.
UN military sources said they would move in and arrest him before long 'in a
way that will minimise civilian casualties'.
US Army Lt Col Kevin McGovern said that detaining Gen Aideed had not been a
goal of the air and ground assaults aimed at crippling his capability to
wage war against UN peacekeepers.
'If we got him, fine. If we didn't, fine,' Col McGovern said. 'We're not out
to make him a martyr.'
UN special envoy Admiral Jonathan Howe said Thursday's operation, which
included a 12-hour ground assault, was 'totally successful' despite
casualties on both sides.
Five UN soldiers - four Moroccans and a Pakistani - were killed and 46
wounded. Hospitals said more than 60 Somali civilians were killed and more
than 100 injured.
At his White House press conference on Thursday night, President Clinton
declared the military action over. It was to undermine Gen Aideed's ability
to 'wreak military havoc' in Mogadishu and to show that the killing of 23
Pakistani UN troops on June 5 would not go unpunished.
During Thursday's fighting, a missile fired by a US attack helicopter hit
the compound of a French aid agency, International Action Against Famine,
killing a Somali worker and wounding seven.
Mr Gregoire Goodstein, the agency's logistical co-ordinator in Somalia,
questioned the wisdom of the UN assault. 'I don't think it was necessary,'
he said. 'I don't think they needed anything that big. It doesn't solve
anything.'
In an ambush yesterday a French television sound technician was killed by
gunmen. Jean-Claude Jumel, 50, had just arrived with other members of a TF1
television crew at Mogadishu airport and was heading into the city when
their vehicle was ambushed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a big scoreboard outside the headquarters of Nigeria's National
Electoral Commission (NEC) in Abuja, put there to display the results of
last Saturday's presidential election. It is blank.
Like the federal capital of Abuja itself, the first general elections for a
decade have consumed a lot of time and money but look as though they will
never be completed.
On Wednesday, the NEC announced it had been restrained from publishing the
election results by a court ruling. There was stunned disbelief, and the
suspicion that Nigerians had been duped once again by a military regime that
has hung on to power a little too long.
Three times since 1991, President Ibrahim Babangida has delayed the
transition to democracy, now scheduled for August 27 - the eighth
anniversary of his seizure of power.
'Two years ago I would not have believed this possible in Nigeria, it was
something that happened in other African states, but we've had so many
changes that Nigerians have become docile,' said a businessman in Lagos, the
commercial capital.
The mood of the Yoruba, who dominate the Social Democratic Party's
stronghold in the south-west, has turned from celebration of the expected
success of their own man, Mr Mashood Abiola, to outrage at the legal
sophistry which may deny him victory. Among the decrees passed by President
Babangida in recent months was an electoral law giving the NEC overall
responsibility for the running of the elections, without interference from
any court.
'Babangida took power by force, playing martial music and telling Nigerians
to stay calm,' said a young trader from Edo state in the mid-west. 'He
didn't worry about law courts and judges in those days. I just don't think
he wants to go.'
Although victory for Mr Abiola could mean a shift of power to the south,
northern Nigerians also regard the belated vote-rigging allegations by the
rival National Republican Convention (NRC) with contempt. 'What was there to
rig? I passed one polling station on Saturday where the election officials
outnumbered the voters,' said one northern chieftain. 'Most people still
thought the election was off on Saturday. It said so the day before on the
Hausa service of the BBC.'
The indignation cuts across party lines: 'The SDP is not my party, but
Abiola won it fairly and he should get his chance,' said one NRC supporter
from Delta state. 'A lot of people don't care if it's Abiola or Tofa (the
NRC candidate). They just want a change.'
Nigeria is run down. Strikes have hit schools and hospitals, rubbish piles
up in the streets of the Lagos business district, power cuts and water
shortages are common, drains and roads are collapsing, and armed robbery is
unchecked by an incompetent and demoralised police force.
During recent fuel shortages, the prices of basic goods and public transport
in Lagos rose by up to 200 per cent and have yet to come down.
Outside the Central Bank of Nigeria, which has halved the value of the naira
in the past year, black market traders sell the currency for 60 per cent
less. If uncertainty over the election continues, they will mark the naira
down further.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Daddy, how do we create jobs?: There is a radical - if
unpopular - solution to unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DADDY, isn't there a way the Government could get rid of unemployment?'
'Yes,' I said. 'It would completely disappear if the government withdrew all
benefits to the unemployed. Then everyone would either work or starve.'
'I can't believe I am hearing this. . . .'
'Well, not many would actually starve,' I continued, 'There would be
charities, soup kitchens, workhouses - things like that. And don't forget,
the government would save Pounds 12bn a year by not paying benefits.
'It could use this money to paint hospitals, repair roads, clean up our
cities. That could provide perhaps 1m jobs. So instead
of being paid for doing nothing . . .'
'Daddy that's utterly heartless. There must be a better way.'
'You mean, apart from just waiting for green shoots? Yes there is. The
government could borrow Pounds 30bn and spend it digging a huge hole in the
ground for the Channel tunnel rail link and cleaning up litter. With that
sort of money it could create millions of jobs.'
'So?'
'Unfortunately, the Government borrowed so much to win the last election and
to pay for the unemployed that it is running out of credit. Now it is being
told to cut spending, which would
throw even more people out of work.'
'But what you want to do . . .'
'I never said I wanted to do it. You asked if there was a way. But it is not
as crazy as you think. It is how things work in Hong Kong, and they are
doing tremendously well. The Americans have very low unemployment benefits
compared with ours and they have created millions of new jobs.'
'Even so,' she said, laying aside The Guardian, 'We would become a low wage,
low skill economy.'
It is a troubling point. But the fact is that Britain has squandered its
intelligence. The report this week from the Adult Literacy
and Basic Skills Unit said that
one in five 21-year-olds is innumerate and one in seven illiterate. It is
not obvious why a Briton who cannot read a manual nor add up a customer's
order should be paid more than assiduous workers in Hong Kong or Malaysia.
On the other hand, not everyone can be an electronics expert. As technology
advances, will some people inevitably be left behind to depend on the work
of others?
It was Mr Parrack, the decorator, who dispelled this gloomy thought. He is
expensive, but we use him because he never lets the paint run, neither does
he leave any speck on the carpet.
'How have things been going for you in the recession?',
I ask.
'Terrible, Mr Wilkinson, absolutely terrible. I haven't had a free weekend
for the last two months.'
Of course not. Parrack cleans immaculately after each day's work. He even
found a way to dismantle and re-assemble the kitchen without upsetting the
cook. He was recommended to us. We recommended him to everyone.
Yet Parrack's work is not, by modern standards, highly skilled. His secret
lies less in sandpaper and undercoating, than in a wonderful attention to
detail and, above all, care for the customer. His are the qualities that
created profit and jobs at Sainsbury, Toyota, Sony, MacDonalds.
(But were sadly neglected in the get-rich-quick culture of the Thatcher debt
binge.)
However deep the recession, Parrack will never need the dole. Does it follow
that if the
dole were abolished, everyone would suddenly become like Parrack?
Alas, no. But that does mean he would have little to fear
from a flood of cheap unskilled labour. His survival would help to
re-establish, as folk wisdom throughout society, that you earn a good living
only by offering excellent service.
Yet even if it were proved that abolishing the dole would result in all the
3m unemployed finding jobs, no government would dare to do it, (although
this government does intend to reduce bogus claims for invalidity benefits).
The Tory heartlands would join my daughter's cry that ours is not that kind
of society.
We are fortunate indeed that society can save us from many evils.
Yet too few Europeans understand that society cannot protect us from a bleak
and elemental truth: in spite of the cushion of inherited resources, and the
redistribution of our present incomes, only two things in the end stand
between us all and starvation - work and skill.

FT  19 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: A good thing about bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING last week drawn heavily on international statistics to demonstrate
the delights of Britain as a place in which to live, this week I note
another virtue. It is the least parochial of nations, the only one of any
size and wealth whose citizenry seems actively concerned with events in all
parts of the world.
This revelation stems from a numbing trawl through continental papers in
search of editorials that do not focus on purely domestic concerns. Often an
apparently international debate turns out to be a device to raise a domestic
matter by other means. German comment on the situation in Bosnia or Somalia
is in fact about Germany: the need to suppress the ancient enemy, Serbia, or
the need for Germans to play a world role.
When such commentators do confront the problems of distant nations, they
lack a certain sophistication. Last week, you may recall, the US, acting
under the authority of the UN, attacked the forces of the warlord General
Aideed in Somalia. There was, noted the august Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, 'Clear resentment against the UN among Aideed's followers.' No
British analysis would have concluded with 'Warlords' followers 'resentful'
at being bombed.'
American comment ranges far and wide but the imperial view again leads to
foreign events being interpreted in terms of American interests. The
situation in Afghanistan or Indochina in the New York Times, one of the two
American imperial dailies, is seen rather as it might have been a hundred
years ago in The Times.
But for real insularity there is nothing like the Russian press. No Moscow
paper since democracy broke out has carried a single editorial on the
domestic affairs of another country, at least one outside the old Soviet
Union. There are two reasons: one is a hangover from the official communist
doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The
advent of democracy means that this doctrine is now honoured to the letter
rather than in the breach.
The other was epitomised in a row that broke out ten days ago which was
witnessed by a colleague. A Russian friend of his was berated by some
western Russian specialists for the fearful insularity of his compatriots -
'You don't even really care about Serbia.'
The reply was violent and extreme: 'You westerners have such soft, easy
lives where no difficult choices have to be made that you have to take on
the troubles of others. You have not got enough problems of your own so you
worry about Somalia.'
That was my second revelation of the week: the real role of newspapers is to
ensure that the basic human demand for bad news is properly met. Britain is
the country that goes, literally, furthest towards meeting this demand. It
is also currently torn by a row which started when a TV news reader said
there should be space for good news on outlets such as his own. But the
truth is that people want the news to inform them about those worse off than
themselves. And they are actually doing good by learning of the plight of
others; there is virtue in being concerned.
The apparent demand for good news is based on what people say they want:
nobody would reply, 'I don't want any good news on my TV screen' when asked
the relevant question. It was the same when the opinion pollsters asked
British voters last year if they would pay more tax to support the welfare
state rather than than see it cut back. They said 'Yes,' then ensured that
the party which advocated this policy was beaten for the fourth time in a
row.
The distinction of the better British papers is that they seek bad news from
the four corners of the earth and have a vast corps of bad news specialists
at their disposal. If you want a picture of how horrible things are in, say,
Burma you have little choice but to skim through British newspaper cuttings.
To be sure individual continental papers will do their best to cover such
exotic matters - Le Monde and the Neue Zurcher Zeitung being the most
notable - but only in Britain can you obtain a proper diversity of approach.
And it is done with little attempt to tell readers why they should care. The
British broadsheet assumes its readers want to be informed about events in
Burma, even if not very often. In El Pais or La Repubblica, the reader would
have to be told where Burma is, in Pravda, what it is.
So if the Russian view is correct, the British not only have unusually
catholic tastes, but their concern with others' problems must reflect the
serenity of their national life. Maybe this is not as absurd as it might
seem: the other impression I got from my trawl through other peoples' papers
is that the mood they reflect is even more sour than that which reigns here.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Private View: A voice for the victims - Pierre Sane, head of
Amnesty International, discusses the modern meaning of human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE London was basking in the 2,500th anniversary celebrations of the
birth of Greek democracy, Vienna this week was witnessing a struggle over
the modern meaning of human rights.
On Tuesday the Dalai Lama was at a meeting arranged by Amnesty International
in the Austrian capital. China had refused to allow the spiritual leader of
the Tibetans to address 5,000 delegates at the biggest United Nations
conference on human rights for 25 years.
The communist leaders in Peking, together with the governments of Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore and other developing countries, are complaining that
the West interferes when it imposes its own definition of human rights upon
them, that it hampers their trade and weakens their competitiveness.
Amnesty International, which fights for prisoners of conscience and victims
of torture, is a western foundation with headquarters in London. But its new
secretary general, Pierre Sane, was born and brought up in Dakar, Senegal.
I went to Vienna and asked him: You come from a developing country. Do you
not sympathise with what these Asian countries say?
'Nobody disagrees when some Asian and African countries talk about the right
to development and about an unequal economic system,' he replied. 'But even
if true that still doesn't give you the right to torture a political
opponent.
'Asians have the right to industrialise but not to crush their own people.
Does it mean that to be competitive in the world today you have to sweat and
oppress your people? If their workers say they want an eight-hour day, then
those workers should not be tortured or jailed because they are organising
in order to get it.'
Do you agree with using trade as a sanction?
'No, not really. I don't think you can impose human rights by force from the
outside. When you impose sanctions you may be punishing people in the
country. More important, you will plant the idea among them that the
solution to their problem will come from outside. And I think the solution
will come from inside. In China, it will be for the Chinese themselves . . .
'
Pierre Sane is an accountant who went to business school. Practising in
Senegal would have meant helping state or foreign companies maximise their
profits and minimise their tax, he said. 'I found morally I could not do
it.' So he went into development aid, studying at the London School of
Economics and Carlton University, Ottawa.
You could have made a lot of money as an accountant. Why did you revolt?
'Because I would have made the money at the expense of my people.'
It hasn't stopped others, I said. Where did this revulsion come from?
'I guess from my education and upbringing.' He grew up in a Christian
household but is not religious, unlike his mother, a teacher, and father,
who was a journalist. 'I suppose they gave us these values of equality and
justice and the idea you can achieve things peacefully by the force of
conviction.
'I cannot stand injustice. And I suppose being black and being from a
continent that has suffered 400 years of unequal relationship with the world
you grow up with this kind of view. Not all Africans do, as you say, because
they used to sell to the slave trade - and some still oppress their own
people.'
The fact you are black could be interpreted as tokenism, I said. Why did
Amnesty choose you?
'There were 1,200 candidates and the executive committee did not start by
wanting a black one. The fact I was black was the icing on the cake.' He
smiled. 'But by appointing me Amnesty is sending a message to the Third
World about universality, multiculturalism.'
Sane wants to broaden Amnesty's analysis of the economic background to human
rights violations without diffusing its campaign on behalf of individual
victims. His scrutiny will include not only nation states but terrorist
groups, multinational companies and institutions like the World Bank and
IMF. 'We have to change the image of Amnesty as being a western
organisation. Even if it is western it is the bearer of universal values -
and being western does not necessarily mean it is bad.'
I referred to the Asian plea of cultural difference and a collective right
of development.
'But that's not the issue. The issue is whether a collective has the right
to torture people in their own collective. If you had a culture which
practised anthropophagy (cannibalism), and argued 'this is our culture' we
will tell them 'even if it's your culture it's not acceptable. So stop it]''
But are you telling them they cannot employ cheap labour in sweatshops?
'I suppose we are telling them that civilised progress makes it unacceptable
today to reach the objective of economic development at the expense of human
dignity. We say 'You will not repeat history.' We have to find a new model
of development that is centred on man.
'Some governments, even though their economy is modern or modernising, even
though their political system is a formal democracy, still behave like in a
feudal system where political dissent is considered an attempt to undermine
the government. They really continue to behave as if their power is coming
from God.'
The UN's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights covers not only the
right to life, liberty, fair trial and freedom of speech but also a right to
work, marry freely, own property, vote in elections, claim social security,
join a trade union and get a free primary education. I suggested to Sane
that it was Utopian, politically unrealistic.
'I don't think so. It's not just an ideal, it's also a yardstick. It is the
minimum that makes an individual a real human being, If by 'unrealistic' you
mean we don't have the means, then I don't think so. The means exist.'
You and I can agree that people should have these things, I said, but as
rights where do they come from?
'They are won through struggle.'
They are not given to us by God, or come from our souls?
'For some people they are: they say we are born with all of this. For others
it is the conquest of belief and social struggle.'
Who says where the list of rights should end?
'I think the list is never finished. Once those are achieved for part or all
of humanity we should push it further.' He suggested, for example, that the
right of asylum for victims of political persecution should eventually be
extended to refugees from economic deprivation.
The premise is that human rights are not only universal but indivisible and
interdependent. I asked Sane what that meant.
'It means that you cannot just be free to starve. It means you are entitled
to food, that the conditions for making you a human being and not an animal
are met. 'Indivisible' means you are not just free from state violence or
state interference in your private affairs. 'Interdependence' means that in
order to satisfy one you have to have the other. If you are poor, you are
powerless. In order to move out of poverty you have to have political power
in your own society.'
Amnesty has been a thorn in the side of democracies as well as
dictatorships: it pursues European states for their treatment of
conscientious objectors and refugees, the US for its use of the electric
chair. I asked Sane to comment on Britain's proposed Pounds 1.5bn sale of
military trainer aircraft to Indonesia in spite of that country's human
rights record in East Timor.
Like all such sales, he said, it could prove counter-productive in the end,
generating a wave of migrants fleeing persecution made possible by the
purchase of arms.
There are 183 countries in the UN and 110 of them still torture prisoners,
according to Amnesty. I asked Sane whether, worldwide, things were getting
better or worse.
'I think better because of the focus of the media, on Bosnia, on Somalia, on
Angola. Throughout the world there is development of moral consciousness -
because of television. You see what is going on, you are affected and you
want it to stop. We forget that the whole of Latin America has come out of
the rule of dictatorship. We forget that even in China economic
transformation is putting pressure on the political system to open up.
'Twenty-five years ago governments could torture in secret, kill in the dark
and we would not be informed. Today, with the network of human rights
organisations, the presence of the media, any act of state violence in one
place is reported throughout the world. The governments are exposed, and
governments do not like to be exposed, especially when they are breaking
their own laws.
'Those who are still putting forward arguments of cultural relativism are on
the defensive. And they are on the defensive because while they are here
arguing about it they are forcing it down the throats of their own people.
The debate is not with us. It is with their own people.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Putting a gloss on UK crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOMICIDE glossies one can take. True Detective and its like have been
around for years, offering consistent instruction to all those commuters who
might one day take up serial killing as a hobby. But a new journal has
appeared this month. I found it tucked next to a quarterly called Murder
Most Foul, but I doubt whether it is really in that innocuous category. The
new publication is called Crime Buster, and its appearance is deeply
disturbing.
'Helping you protect yourself and your family' is what it sets out to do. A
fair enterprise, on the face of it. As we are reminded passim by the
magazine, our homes are violated by thieves at the rate of one every 26
seconds. Cars fare little better, and you can even have the mobile phone
whipped from your hand as you speak. So Crime Buster appears to be on to a
good thing. And in this first issue, it has tackled its rubric with spirit.
For a start, there are prizes. Do a crime busting crossword puzzle and you
could win a full surveillance system. Runners-up get a 'really robust
personal alarm' which even if crushed in a villain's fist will scream at 130
decibels on their behalf.
Then there are seasonal tips. Watch out if you go sunbathing in the garden:
this is a nice time for opportunist intruders. But if you go abroad for the
sun, the robbers like it even better. Your house will probably be stripped
at leisure, and gratuitously defiled to boot. Never mind: July's issue will
at least supply a guide on where you stand most chance of being mugged when
you do take that foreign holiday.
I have learned to beware of all sorts of new criminals. For example, the
quill clipper. This is the dodger who, feigning a stupefied state, lurches
at you in a crowded place with his newspaper. What you don't know is that
with a deft flick of his paper he has swiped the pen from your breast
pocket. Positively Dickensian, that move.
But it has to be said that Crime Buster does not romanticise the criminal
class. Its contributors hardly ever refer to thieves as thieves. 'Clowns' is
a favourite: I also noticed 'morons', 'scumbags' and jerks'. Car thieves
have their own nomenclature: 'twockers' generically (Taking Without Owner's
Consent), 'cats' if they specialise in car audio theft. The opening (and
only) metaphor of the magazine likens the law-abiding public to a flock of
sheep, doing nothing while wolves raid at will. Then on the back page there
is a rabid-looking hyena: one of the 'cats', perhaps, about to slaver over
your Blaupunkt.
There are photo-narratives showing how villains get away with things, or how
the law apprehends them. It is hard to say who is the more dominant presence
in the magazine: the old-hand bobby, the master locksmith, or a figure in
blurred silhouette simply referred to as 'The Insider'.
The Insider seems to have done time and knows all the wrinkles: he is prone
to making jolly ex cathedra interjections. 'If you've got it and you flaunt
it, someone will nick it]'; 'Burglars hate bolts]', and so on. He sometimes
alludes to thieves as 'the lads': though he is billed as a reformed
character, you might still want to count your spoons after having him to
lunch.
The advertisements reveal a relentless battle out there between rival
security systems. A large chunk of Crime Buster is effectively a consumer
guide, guiding you towards the ultimate infra-red detection light, trying a
jemmy on all sorts of locks.
Never has the line about the Englishman's home being his castle sounded so
true. This is a real fortress mentality. In fact, it cannot be long before
Crime Buster recommends its readers to wear a suit of chain mail when out on
the streets: already it is touting bullet- and dagger-proof vests.
This sort of flesh-creeping view of the future is dismaying enough. Equally
dismaying is the way in which these precautions become a sort of culture of
their own (one manufacturer of bars and grilles describes itself as
producing 'Poetry in Steel').
But what is most dismaying is what Crime Buster never mentions. Across 85
pages, there is not an iota of a scintilla of a suggestion that we could
bust most crime by being a more equitable society. Not a whisper. And that
is a very sad silence.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Tofubar and cedifop - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WAS when the BBC seriously tried to teach us to speak properly, but
nowadays its staff say 'lorandorder' and 'kilOMeter' like anybody else. So
don't expect that Frank Delaney's series Word of Mouth (Radio 4, Tuesdays)
will be smacking our wrists. No way - it begins by teaching us Eurospeak,
words like tofubar and cedifop, that derive from acronyms and are, we are
assured, the slang of top people in today's Europe. Tofubar is a computer
term, Things Are Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition; cedifop is from a German
acronym and says European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training.
These at least mean the same in every language, while common words like
'subsidiary' and 'federal' may vary with nationality. Delaney did not teach
us much; next day would have given us Thorp, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing
Plant. Instead, he announced a competition to nominate the best spoken
English, in which specimens John Betjeman and Belfast reporter Jerry
Anderson seemed to me a dead heat, and to deviate among tattoo-artists, or
dermographers as they are now.
Another brand of quasi-English is heard in Radio 3's In a Word, where Jeremy
Beadle explains such terms as expressionism, symbolism, futurism and the
rest. Don't suspect he will finish the series with a crushing tape revealing
our general ignorance; this is Jeremy J. Beadle, not the television comic. I
did not feel he had anything new to say.
Radio 3 calls last Sunday's Doctor Faustus a 'new version' by director Sue
Wilson, but its novelty was mostly in the less valid inner scenes - though
there was a surprising number of trivial changes in the familiar dialogue of
Acts 1 and 5. I covered those Acts a week or so ago when they were done on
the World Service, and need say no more now than that Stephen Moore was a
fine Faustus (who correctly used the old Latin pronunciation), and Philip
Voss an interesting Mephostophilis with some positively human emotions now
and then. If Sue Wilson wrote as well as directed the middle bits, she was
rewriting Rowley or Nashe besides Marlowe, and she did it in the same
spirit. We had pop music for the Seven Deadly Sins (score by Anthea Gomez),
and I think I heard an anachronistic 'Uncle Sam' from Covetousness, though
the words were not easy to follow. We visited the Pope's feast and we
followed the adventures of Robin with his stolen textbook and the
Horse-courser with Faustus's wooden leg. I was truly alarmed by the sound
made by Hell's unveiling.
This is all of Marlowe until the autumn; but if he were with us this century
he would probably be writing like James M. Cain, whose Double Indemnity
began Radio 4's season, 'Saturday Night at the Movies' (on Saturday). This
ingenious tale of murder on the railway has no hero, just a bunch of
Americans concerned almost equally with adultery, money and murder. The
radio version by John Fletcher had a splendidly pictorial quality, was
played excitingly by Frederic Forrest, Theresa Russell, Molly Ringwald and a
hard-to-recognise John Wood, and was directed by Andy Jordan.
More drama on the World Service, A Shaft of Sunlight by Abhijat Joshi, that
got the special award in the World Service's playwriting competition for
writers with English as a second language. It began with a strong
Hindu-Moslem situation, but relapsed into reminiscences. The English was
more literary than dramatic.
I heard Witchbroom, the current book at bedtime to test the risk of its
keeping me awake. It is a magical story about Creole life on a Caribbean
cocoa-plantation, enchantingly read by the author, Lawrence Scott, abridged
by Margaret Bushby and directed by Marina Salandy-Brown  - all Trinidadians.
I slept like a log.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Intimate opera thrives in St Louis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERA Theatre of St Louis remains, in its 18th year of existence, a
youthfully exuberant, adventurous, significant enterprise. In terms of care
for both the main and the marginal matters of opera performance, there was
plenty in the 1993 season to renew admiration for this most serious and
purposeful of American artistic institutions.
Regular readers of this page will recall that Opera Theatre is an annual,
month-long late-spring mounting of four operas in the agreeable (and, by US
standards, tiny) Loretto-Hilton auditorium, on the campus of Webster
University, in the St Louis suburbs. Colin Graham, one of the world's most
experienced opera producers, is artistic director. Singers are drawn very
largely from the rich reservoir of young Americans. Vinson Cole, Jerry
Hadley, Dawn Upshaw, Susanne Mentzer, Sylvia McNair and Thomas Hampson are
but a few of the internationally-known names given early prominence by Opera
Theatre.
Stars of the future may be made here, yet superstar-itis and gigantomania,
those two Deadly Sins of American opera, are vigilantly opposed. The
Loretto-Hilton thrust stage and three-sided audience disposition promotes
intimacy. The St Louis Symphony, a leading US orchestra, plays for all
performances. Repertory has ranged widely; popular favourites, while not
excluded, are set amidst rarer blooms. This year was a typical St Louis
mixture: Don Giovanni, Massenet's Cendrillon, Billy Budd and the world
premiere of David Carlson's Midnight Angel.
Everything is sung in English. Since throughout the English-speaking world
the parrotting of the so-called original language to the accompaniment of
surtitles is fast becoming the rule, the St Louis insistence on making
immediate, meaningful theatre out of opera seems correspondingly the more
precious.
The attractively tree-covered and tented grounds of the Loretto-Hilton
invite picnicking and, afterwards, the kind of civilised sociability in
which artists and audience mingle late into the night to prolong the
pleasures of the occasion. A visitor's daytime hours can be wonderfully well
filled in St Louis, in which two great rivers, much fine architecture, many
noble monuments and one of the most important American art galleries are
there for the enjoying.
The Budd was of special interest - for the fact that Graham, a Britten
devotee and interpreter of high repute, was staging the work for the first
time in his long career, and for the revival of the Ur-text. At its 1951
Covent Garden premiere the opera was presented in four acts, with a
big-scale ensemble closing the first. Finding it too long, Britten later
re-formed the four acts into two, in the process removing the ensemble.
He was, I think, right to do so: while the Muster is excitingly built up,
with bold contrasts of solo and chorus and an early entrance for Captain
Vere, the patriotic sentiments it expresses are already more effectively
characterised later on in the opera. This first version - at least as shown
in St Louis - takes a dangerous amount of time to get going. I make the
parenthetical proviso only because, by the light of recent British Budd
productions, fiercely searching, even 'critical' in their analysis of words
and situations, Graham's approach seemed oddly old-fashioned.
In particular, the principal-boy quality - all dewy charm and radiant smiles
 -he drew from the greatly talented, inexperienced young baritone Steven
Combs reminded one how difficult the title role can be to place as a
three-dimensional character. Issues of class, of social and sexual politics,
were lightly treated. Peter Kazaras's Captain Vere, sung with exceptional
refinement, and Jeffrey Wells's powerful Claggart, too consistently
full-voiced, seemed to leave in their wake the wrong sort of question-marks.
The strength, and indeed the triumph, of the experience was the thrillingly
uninhibited singing of the St Louis male chorus, packed with singers of
'solo' calibre drilled to electrifyingly responsive ensemble by
chorus-master, Cary John Franklin, and conductor, Robert Spano. Last year
Graham set up a permanent wall (made of fibre-glass with a handsome
faux-brick finish) to fill the stage back, for the purposes of acoustical
focussing and production economy. Derek McLane's set worked well against it,
once one had got over the inevitable absence of marine atmosphere in the
scenic complement. The audience, new to Britten's Melville opera, was
tightly gripped.
Cendrillon, a blend of formal savoir-faire, wit, icing-sugar fairy-music and
tender sentiment, is best Massenet. I loved Graham's light-fingered account
of it. Stepmother (Josepha Gayer) and stepsisters (Connie-lin Chmura and
Jill Grove) were broadly but not crudely handled. The travesty Prince (Mary
Ann McCormick, a rich-voiced mezzo) was stylish. The duets for
Lucette-Cendrillon (Susan Rosenbaum, a light, precise soprano) and her weak,
loving father Pandolphe (David Evitts) injected the right amount of pathos.
Perhaps the last degrees of elegance were missing in the playing, and in the
conducting of Carol Crawford. The beneficence of the experience survived
unscathed.
Giovanni, in a weakly 'inventive' staging by Giles Havergal (of the Glasgow
Citizen's), and The Midnight Angel, a toshy, sploshy decoction of
'accessible' (ie 1940s film-musical) manners and lame-brained romantic
fantasy, gave one less to write home about. Of both shows, though, the
introduction to notable American singers new to me proved the saving grace.
Christine Brewer (a generous-toned, at times generalised Donna Anna) comes
this season to Covent Garden, Patricia Racette (a passionate, colourful
Donna Elvira) to Welsh National Opera. I look forward to hearing both again,
and no less - from the Midnight Angel cast - the excellent young lyric tenor
Tracey Welborn and light mezzo Christine Abraham.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Conceptual posturings in Venice - William Packer finds
the best pavilions avoiding the Biennale's guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THEME of Achille Bonito Oliva's first Venice Biennale as director is,
The Cardinal Points of Art - with critical judgment and enthusiasm cast
alike to the four winds. An open and generous eclecticism, of course, would
be unexceptionable in these post-modernist times, were it only matched by
any sense of critical discrimination and responsibility.
As it is, anything goes, just so long as it conforms to the interests of the
current academic avant-garde. Installation, sound and video, conceptual
posturings, the striking of social and political attitudes, are in: anything
founded in the direct perceptual experience of the real and visible world is
on the margin. So much for openness and pluralism.
Oliva glosses his title as reflecting the 'cultural nomadism . . . the
internationalism and interdisciplinarity'. But El Greco and Tiepolo in
Madrid, Holbein and Rubens in London, Poussin in Rome, Picasso in Paris,
Turner everywhere - this nomadism is hardly new. Art has always been
international and trans-cultural. Nationalism may now be the bogey-word, but
yet the national pavilions of the Biennale itself have long been by their
very nationalism important agents in that exchange. 'Given the present
historical moment of fragmentation and division, bordering on tribal
warfare, they (the Biennale's guidelines) represent the only political
response that culture can offer . . . ' Ah: politics, not Art, are to be
justification and excuse.
As usual many of the countries with permanent pavilions evade the issue, and
in spite of all the nonsense, there are good things, even good installations
to be found. Along with the Korean, Nam June Paik and his video-circus,
Germany are showing their own Hans Haacke. He has taken a pneumatic drill to
the pavilion's marble floor, heaving and cracking the slabs into a tumbled,
treacherous surface, the pieces clattering and echoing as the visitor
gingerly makes his way across. Outside, the imposing fascist facade is
untouched but for a large image of Hitler and Mussolini at the Biennale of
1934 in the entrance, and a huge 1990 Deutschmark above the door. Political
thoughts apart - and Haacke has the grace to allow us to think our own - it
is a most arresting mise en scene.
Even more theatrical, with a beginning, a middle and an end, is the
installation by the Russian, Ilja Kabakov, in the Russian Pavilion. In we go
behind a high paling fence and up into the pavilion itself into what might
be a long-abandoned work-shop, strewn with rubbish. Out through the back
door and we find in the garden below us a red kiosk-Kremlin with its windows
blank and the martial music of old Communism blaring from hidden speakers.
More direct than the Haacke, it is even so an ambiguous and oddly touching
piece.
Elsewhere I liked the simple, architectonic sculpture of Christina Iglesias
in the Spanish Pavilion - shared with an unusually flatulent piece by Tapies
 -Damian's rocket-like Column on its raising-trestle in the Romanian
Pavilion; the meticulously-carved surrealism of the French-born Louise
Bourgeois in the American Pavilion; and the no less meticulous linear
abstraction of Jorn Larsen in the Danish Pavilion. The Swiss sculptor,
Christoph Rutimann, has taken over the church of San Stae on the Grand Canal
beyond the Rialto, tilting the floor up and at an angle to mask the chancel
and the altar, an effective dislocation of the interior space though
irritating to anyone who wants to see the paintings. In the group from the
African States, Quattara, an artist from the Ivory Coast now based in New
York, is outstanding, with three mixed-media panels of rich texture and
ambiguous reference. And as remarkable as anything is Artival Geva's huge
working greenhouse and artificial farm that the Israelis have installed at
the very heart of the gardens, dripping with water beneath the trees.
Aperto, the selective international survey of younger artists in the old
rope-shop of the Arsenale, is subtitled 'Emergency', though the emergency
can only be its own. To walk through this farrago of self-indulgence
masquerading a creativity is a deeply dispiriting experience. Here is a
whole generation that has been led to believe that simply to have an idea,
any idea, is enough, and if it has a fashionable correctness so much the
better - anti-war, anti-capitalist, anti-male - you name it.
But even received and conventional ideas can produce great art, of which
truth the richness of Christian art is but one example, though wonderfully
appropriate in Venice. The problem lies not with the ideas themselves so
much as with the heresy that their mere statement or indication is enough,
and any further realisation a tedious irrelevance. There is no art without
form, and the particular form matters very much. Technology is not
technique. A cow pickled in a tank of formaldehyde is, well, a pickled cow.
Painting and sculpture are testing disciplines, but so are dancing and
performing, writing music and making use of language. Composer and audience
are not grateful to inept musicians, the reader no friend to the illiterate
author.
Which brings us back to the British Pavilion, in which Richard Hamilton,
that guru of mind over matter and the technological sidestep when painting
and drawing get difficult, as for him they so often do, is our current
champion. Beautifully installed by the British Council, his work parades to
the world the complexities of Northern Ireland, of Tory Britain and even of
the Gulf War, with numb-minded simplicity. Quite whose, here, is the
trahison des clercs is for you to judge. Needless to say, Hamilton, with
Tapies, has been awarded the Biennale's Leone d'Oro.
The Venice Biennale: in the Giardini di Castello, the Corderie dell'Arsenale
and at other sites across the City, until October 10: sponsored by Swatch
SMH Italia, Longines, and Il Mattino.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Vintage Osborne - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal National Theatre is absolutely right to have revived John
Osborne's Inadmissible Evidence. In some ways it looks an even better play
today than when it was first performed at the Royal Court nearly 30 years
ago. What may once have seemed mildly shocking now looks like a mature
commentary on the social scene of the early 1960s. The divorce law was a
painful charade; lawyers and clients had to resort to casuistry, if not
worse, to get it to work at all.
Osborne's dilemma of never being sure of whether he prefers the past to the
present comes out just as clearly in Inadmissible Evidence as it does in his
earlier Look Back in Anger. Does he like the seediness that at least allows
divorce to take place, or does he condemn it? Is he hurt because too much
has changed, or too little? Is he a reformer or a reactionary? The fact that
it's hard to answer shows what a good playwright he can be.
The opening scene of Inadmissible Evidence suggests a deep suspicion of
Harold Wilson with his promises (threats?) of the technological revolution
and the triumph of science. That was in 1964 when Wilson's reputation as a
potential reformer was at its height, so Osborne may have been prescient in
expressing doubts.
On the other hand, what now seems far and away the best scene in the play
concerns a mild-mannered, married homosexual who has been caught by the
police. The portrait of the man is entirely sympathetic. It is one of the
most moving scenes that Osborne has written. Here is Osborne in the
unexpected role of thoughtful, liberal reformer, slightly ahead of his time.
In Di Trevis's production at the Lyttelton, the homosexual scene is central
to the play. It comes after Bill Maitland, the lecherous, heavy-drinking,
pill-taking solicitor has heard one woman's petition after another for
divorce. All those women are played, as Osborne always planned, by the same
actress - here, Lynn Farleigh. Maitland takes them through their complaints
while reflecting on his own infidelities.
The frisson comes when he finds that a male client can tell a similar, seedy
tale about homosexual affairs. The stroke of brilliance is that the man is
played by the same actor who earlier appeared as a junior clerk in the
solicitors' office and was much despised by Maitland. Again this is not a
new gloss by Ms Trevis; it was what Osborne always specified. Still, it
takes acute direction to bring it off. Ms Trevis succeeds magnificently, as
does Jason Watkins in the dual role of Jones the clerk and Maples the
client. Incidentally, the references to local place names, like Gunnersbury,
in the Maples story may help to explain why John Betjeman so admired the
play.
Ideally Inadmissible Evidence would end shortly after that. The piece,
however, contains some of the worst as well as the best of Osborne, the
worst being his inability to stop while the going is good. Thus in the last
30 minutes of a 3 1/4 hour show the structure collapses, and it is a
spurious, undeveloped part of the plot that the Law Society should be after
Maitland for cutting corners. The man has already fallen apart.
One other peculiarity. Trevor Eve's Maitland makes an implausible recovery
from vomiting and drunkenness in the office early in the morning to more or
less normal behaviour without even a shave or a shower. Surely someone must
have noticed the stubble. Nicol Williamson in the Royal Court production
made the role more convincingly dissolute and physically neurotic. Eve has
to cope with the bigger space at the Lyttelton, which is not wholly to his
advantage. He does not dominate, but you could say that this makes the first
2 1/2 hours a better play.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: The Tate goes west - Antony Thorncroft visits the
gallery's latest offshoot in St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT BRINGS you up short in the newest off-shoot of the Tate Gallery,
opening next Saturday in St Ives, is a beach scene. In a wide sweep of
breath-taking beauty there is golden sand, an azure sea, and that pellucid
light which always makes a St Ives painting so arresting.
But this is not a canvas. It is the commanding view from the broad balcony
of the museum out towards Porthmeor Beach, one of the finest seascapes in
the country. The Museum is built into the cliffs confronting the sea and
will act as a beacon for the surfers who roll ashore here. And more than a
beacon: the museum has a closet fitted out to accommodate surf boards.
If there is a perennial battle between art and nature, the Tate St Ives
cannot win. In fact, architects Eldred Evans and David Shelev have totally
embraced the outside environment. From the museum's roof-top restaurant you
gaze down on the grey slate roofs of the town that appear time and again in
the work of the St Ives school artists. Many of the paintings on the wall
replicate scenes that can be observed through the port hole windows in a
building which, like the topsy turvy, winding and wriggly place it graces,
continually comes up with surprises.
The Tate St Ives is such an obvious good thing. It enables the Tate to show
more of its generous holding of the art of the first, post-1925, St Ives
school, of Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Christopher Wood and Naum Gabo,
plus the second post-war generation of Patrick Heron, Peter Lanyon, Terry
Frost, Roger Hilton and more. Within three years, continually changing
exhibitions will give all the Tate's 300 hard core St Ives paintings an
airing on their home ground, plus many of its 500 works by artists who can
generously reckon to have been influenced by St Ives, artists who range from
Whistler to Rothko, who both visited.
But more than that, the gallery is excellent for St Ives. The town faces a
hard choice. There are forces which want to play up its mass tourist
attractions, to turn it into a mini-Blackpool. But the museum could pull in
an estimated 70,000 visitors a year of a very different stamp, drawn to its
heroic artistic history.
The graphic attractions of England's toe were first recognised by Turner,
but it was the Newlyn School in the late 19th century which made it the
centre of plein air, realist painting. In the late 1920s Nicholson and the
modernists arrived a few miles away from Newlyn, across the peninsula at St
Ives, and artists have never left. Only Hackney, in east London, can boast
as many working artists and studios in such a tight community. The Tate St
Ives can feed off a thriving professional bedrock, keen to lecture, to
educate, to show. It will also provide up to 60 much-needed jobs.
It is also good for Cornwall, a depressed county with pitiful arts
provision. Now its deputy chief executive Richard Lester can envisage an
artistic colony, embracing the whole Penwith peninsula, with the Tate St
Ives and the nearby Barbara Hepworth Museum acting as the bait for tourists
to a group of 30 art galleries.
The idea of a Tate St Ives is attributed to Martin Rewcastle of South West
Arts, to Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate who now runs the Henry
Moore Trust (which contributed Pounds 250,000), and to Sir Richard
Carew-Powell, whose family have helped lead Cornwall for centuries.
They all did their bit, as did the European Commission, whose Pounds 868,000
contribution to the Pounds 3.3m project was the essential glue. Fortunately
the museum was built on the site of an abandoned gas works, which brought
Pounds 450,000 of Government aid for rehabilitating a derelict site. By the
end the money came from public, private, and corporate sources, from local,
national and international cashboxes. On Wednesday another Pounds 150,000
plus should be raised from an auction at Sotheby's consisting mainly of
donated works by St Ives artists. A Pounds 1.50 admission charge will meet
most of the Pounds 250,000 annual running costs.
What do the visitors get for their money? It is a small museum, with just
over a hundred works on view, and not at all didactic. After all, these are
generally intimate paintings, with subdued colours. They may be in the
modernist tradition, but created at a stage when modernism was still
exploring new possibilities. They represent a concept as well as a place,
but St Ives is still the hero - the works gain extra relevance from the
immediate views out to sea from the gallery, over the town from the
restaurant roof. Virtually all the works on display were painted within a
mile of the gallery.
The entrance is dominated by the first large coloured glass window created
by Patrick Heron, part gift, part commission. Another contemporary 'St Ives'
artist, Terry Frost, is contributing a hanging. Then up to a gallery of the
first St Ives school, with all the familiar names and, for the opening, a
major Lanyon. This selection will be changed annually. Another gallery is
devoted to the post-War painters, while the remaining three smaller areas
are given over to special exhibitions.
The most distinctive in the early months is a rarely seen series of
paintings and drawings of patients captured by Barbara Hepworth when she
worked in a hospital during the War. The main concourse is also an eye
grabber - a display of the pots of Bernard Leach and Hamada, whose
contribution to the current international success of British studio ceramics
is greater than the relevance of the St Ives painters.
For Nick Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, the out station in St Ives is
a cause of much pleasure and some concern. He knows from his experience with
the Tate Liverpool that, like all off-spring, they turn to their parent for
extra financing if plans go awry. Liverpool still absorbs around Pounds
300,000 from his annual grant. With his mind fixed on the new Tate Gallery
of Modern Art in London, Serota does not want a debilitating drain on his
limited funds or time. On the other hand any opportunity to air works from
the 80 per cent of the Tate's stock that languishes in store is obviously a
good thing.
The Tate St Ives has gone through with amazing speed and few setbacks. It
brings timely attention to perhaps the last regional school of British art
to have an international impact. It gives Establishment blessing to a
thriving community of artists working in a deprived region. Plans for a
local artist in residence are well advanced. There will be a busy
educational programme. St Ives will not act as a model, but as an example.
Already the local arts lobby in Norwich is talking to the Tate about a
similar link, although this time in the existing Norwich museum. And if
anyone ever needed an excuse to visit St Ives, here is one that would
satisfy the most demanding traveller.

PADDY CLARKE HA HA HA by Roddy Doyle Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 12.99, 282
pages
TOWARDS the end of this novel its eponymous hero, Paddy Clarke, a
10-year-old from the dismal working class Dublin suburbs of 1968,
inarticulately senses he needs affection, badly - even from his younger
brother Sinbad. Sinbad's role in life is to be used by Paddy as a punchbag
or a receptacle for lighter fuel.
'I won't hit you again, okay; ever,' says Paddy. No answer from Sinbad.
Paddy continues. 'I waited a bit. Then I kicked him. And I thumped him.
Twice. Then I felt my back go freezing; someone was looking. I turned.
No-one. I couldn't hit him again though.'
Roddy Doyle has lost none of his talent for close social observation and
linguistic emulation in this, his fourth published novel in four years. His
three previous - The Commitments (1987), The Snapper (1990) and The Van
(1991) - were set in fictional Barrytown and established Doyle's reputation
for having a perfect ear for the vernacular of the back streets of working
class Dublin.
The Barrytown trilogy depicts Dublin's underclass as having immense power,
self-esteem, innate dignity, wit and sense of humour, qualities which enable
the characters to surmount the shabbiness of their context. Despite the
social and intellectual deprivation, they inhabit an attractive, vigorous
world, where poverty is eclipsed by a fecund, rollicking, communal humanity.
With Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha Doyle stays inside the head of Barrytown's
underclass, but the world has become much darker, fiercer, fragmented.
Rather than finding comfort inside his community or breaking out of it into
a wider world, Paddy Clarke is trapped, limited to discovering the
inadequacies of his context without being able to either fight or accept
them. He becomes estranged, breaching one of his society's taboos - fighting
well but dirty - and his defiance in his consequent isolation rings hollow.
In other words, there is much less Roddy Doyle ho ho ho; much more Krapp's
Last Tape. What we have is a novelist of considerable power who knows he can
turn on the tricks and make us smile wryly or hoot with laughter, but who
delves instead into something more profound - the creation of an
individual's moral self.
That makes the novel sound didactic. It isn't. But when the laughter died
away in The Snapper a background vitality ebbed back into the picture. In
Paddy Clarke, each time the smiling stops the heart is left a fraction more
frozen over.
Doyle has not been universally adored in his home city. His characters use
what conventional society regards as foul language. Their world is dominated
by the pub, music, football, TV and sex - hardly the kind of thing the
snobbish elites of Dublin society wish to have their city associated with.
They should be much more seriously offended by Paddy Clarke, a novel with
much less swearing and hardly any references to sex. On the basis of this,
Doyle is setting out to explore themes much more subversive than bad
language. Paddy Clarke shows Doyle's ability to deliver crushing judgments
on the shortcomings of human society, yet like Joyce to be above, beyond,
absent from the novel, paring his fingernails; but only with apparent
indifference.

CULTURE OF COMPLAINT: THE FRAYING OF AMERICA by Robert Hughes Oxford Pounds
12.95, 203 pages
ROBERT Hughes' critique of contemporary American culture is already a
tearaway hit across the Atlantic. This Hughes - Australian-born historian
and art critic of Time magazine - punishes wayward language with the punchy
hostility his namesake Merv hurls down on sloppy batting.
That apart, Hughes R. is a lot funnier, particularly sharp on any and all
sign of whinging and whining. 'We want to create a sort of linguistic
Lourdes, where evil and misfortune are dispelled by a dip in the waters of
euphemism'. As a consequence, 'The range of victims available ten years ago
 -blacks, chicanos, Indians, women, homosexuals - has now expanded to
include every permutation of the halt, the blind, the lame and the short,
or, to put it correctly, the differently abled, the other-visioned and the
vertically challenged'. Hughes lays about him to left and to right as he
expands the thesis into politics, literature, education, and finally into
the art world he knows best.
The patterns are all of a piece. 'The Gulf War taught us that bombing a
place flat was 'servicing a target', or 'visiting a site', that bombing it
again to make sure that not even a snake or a thornbush survived was
'revisiting a site'.' For Hughes such fastidious distancings have an
inevitable pay-off in the Rushdie affair: 'At home in America it was the
height of sexist impropriety to refer to a young female as a 'girl' instead
of a 'woman'. Abroad in Tehran, however, it was more or less OK for a cabal
of regressive theocratic bigots to murder novelists on State policy.
Oppression is what we do in the West. What they do in the Middle East is
'their' culture.'
Hughes finds that the new - and sloppy - thinking has chalked up its
greatest successes in the area of history. So what Americans teach
themselves about slavery is pickled in the prism of political correctness
(sic]). 'The solitary guilt of Europe and America continues to haunt
discussions of slavery. Africa, Islam and Europe all participated in black
slavery, enforced it, profited from its miseries. But in the end, only
Europe (including, here, North America) proved itself able to conceive of
abolishing it. That we have so-called historians who are prepared to gloss
over this fact strikes me as remarkable.'
Americans' persistent inability to think straight and write plain causes
Hughes endless and barbed grief, supporting his contention that
intellectually the country is 'fraying' at the centre as well as at the
edges. He reserves some of his sharpest deliveries for the end. Over the
Mapplethorpe affair Hughes notes with caustic despair a critical colleague
'reflecting on one photo of a man's fist up his partner's rectum, and
another of a finger rammed into a penis, and fluting on about 'the
centrality of the forearm' and how it anchors the composition, and how 'the
scenes appear to be distilled from real life', and how their formal
arrangement 'purifies, even cancels, the prurient elements'. This is the
kind of exhausted and literally de-moralised aestheticism that would find no
basic difference between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley spectacular,
since both, after all, are examples of Art-Deco choreography'.
The appetite is whetted for a new Hughes television series, American
Visions, expected in a year or two. Meantime, we can revel in the racy
ruderies of this book.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Squeezing the dancing classes - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE number two minister at the Department of National Heritage admits
to taking the artistic views of MP Terry Dicks 'extremely seriously' the
arts world should start to tremble. Dicks is the professional 'bovver' boy
of the arts in the House of Commons who likes nothing more than roughing up
subsidised ballet dancers, actors, artists and the like.
That Iain Sproat, the ferocious right winger who was a surprise choice at
the recent re-shuffle to bolster Peter Brooke at Heritage, should agree this
week that most people think the Pounds 225m a year spent on the Arts Council
would be better invested in three new hospitals, seems like surrendering to
the enemy without a fight.
It suggests that the arts are on target to do very badly out of the intense
Treasury examination of public expenditure. Already the Arts Council is set
to receive Pounds 5m less in 1994-95, its first ever reduction in grant:
suddenly it seems to face even greater surgery, which would trigger off
wholesale cutbacks and closures among its clients. And the Arts Council is
not making things easier by choosing this moment to finally get around to
selecting winners and losers among arts organisations, giving more to
contemporary dance and the visual arts, and less to regional theatres.
In the event, when it announces its plans next month, the Council's hit list
is likely to be tiny. Only a handful of companies will be penalised, one or
two losing all their subsidy, a few more suffering a reduction. The excuse
will be that they are just not up to standard. Less than Pounds 1m will be
released to bolster dance and art.
At the same time the Council will announce a much longer list of companies
that will suffer if the government goes ahead with the planned Pounds 5m cut
in its budget. The hope is that this will cause such an outcry that the
government will have second thoughts.
It is a nice idea, but with a weak minister, a monetarist number two, and a
philistine crew at the treasury, the only hope for the arts is direct
contact with the Prime Minister, who is thought to have a soft spot for the
argument that, as well as being a good investment, a flourishing arts scene
is a sign of a nation at ease with itself.
At every level the arts world is out to lobby John Major. Corporate sponsors
of the arts are keen to play their part, making it clear this week that they
will not make good any shortfall in subsidy. With the government aware of
the 'new' money destined for the arts and the heritage from the Lottery in
early 1995, it may feel that it can withstand a spate of closure and outrage
stories, even though the promise was that the Lottery was to be an extra,
not an alternative, to government aid.
Lobbying by the arts to preserve funding has begun already. As ever, the
warm hearted Philip Hedley of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, was first
into the field, chairing a gathering at the National Theatre this week which
was alerted to the pitiful state of Theatre-in-Education.
The capping of councils has forced many local authorities to cut spending on
this area - the most dramatic casualty, Harlow Theatrevan, has lost its
entire Pounds 146,000 grant - but in all 22 companies that bring play acting
into schools are under threat. The campaign wants the DNH to cough up Pounds
1m to keep alive this first experience of theatre for most children.
An even more necessary pressure group is that assembled to convince
Education Secretary John Patten that discretionary grants for dance and
drama students should be made mandatory. Once again it is reductions in
local authority spending that have persuaded half the councils in the
country to axe such grants. In 1992 the number of accepted students who were
forced to turn down places because they failed to receive sufficient grants
rose by 75 per cent in drama, and 100 per cent in dance. In all, around 40
per cent of students offered places last year were unable to take them up.
The experience of the London Contemporary Dance School is typical. It has
just launched a Pounds 100,000 appeal to raise money for scholarships. This
year, of the 86 students it has accepted for the new intake in September,
just 21 are British, a third of the usual number. Even some of the British
students who have accepted a place will be forced to drop out before, or
during, their course because of lack of funding. It means that our dance
schools are dominated by overseas students and our drama schools by middle
class students, financially supported by their parents.
It is unfair that geography should determine who will become a professional
dancer or actor. It is also unfair that art and music students are protected
with mandatory grants, art students because they are seen as part of the
craft and design industry, music because Ted Heath willed it so when he was
in power. Dance and drama needs an equally powerful supporter today.
Most unfortunate of all is the fact that these two campaigns, which are
trying to make good earlier cuts in funding, will be overtaken by the
campaigns likely to start in the next few months to counter even more
dramatic reductions in spending.
One alarmed group in the arts world is adopting a softly, softly approach.
In its review of the workings of the Arts Council, consultants Price
Waterhouse suggested that the touring department should be closed down, its
functions spread around the specialist art forms with the aim of eventually
privatising its role. This would save 12 jobs - although, of course, the
Council would have to pay the outside company handling the service.
This is part of PW's Option Two, which Peter Brooke seems inclined to
accept. But this week the directors of the 50 leading receiving theatres,
and the main touring dance, opera and drama companies in England expressed
concern at the proposal. They think the current system, which brings a
leavening of subsidised artistic events to commercial theatres like the
Palace Manchester and the Theatre Royal Nottingham, works well. Rather than
make a public expression of their concern they have asked for private
meetings with Peter Brooke and Arts Council chairman Lord Palumbo to argue
their case.

SING THE BODY ELECTRIC by Adam Lively Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 440
pages
THE WEATHER IN ICELAND by David Profumo Picador Pounds 12.99, 310 pages
THOMAS Mann did it so well in Doctor Faustus and subsequent writers have
failed so dismally that any idea of a novel about a fictitious composer
ought to be aborted as soon as it is conceived. But here is Adam Lively,
inventing the biography of one Paul Clearwater (born 2030, died 2099) as the
springboard for an ambitious novel of ideas about the power of music and
creativity. Pitching the story into the next century allows Lively to detach
his ideas from the reality of the 20th-century, and offer a teasing timewarp
of artistic life 70 years on.
The opening, though, could not be less auspicious. The novel begins with a
sequence of Clearwater's letters in which he recounts to his sister his
arrival in 2064 in the complacent backwater of Wellfleet, after he has fled
from the big-town superficiality of New Venice. Even were one not already
profoundly suspicious of a composer who could have written an opera called
The Crooked Timber of Humanity, Clearwater's letters dispel the final drops
of sympathy: he shows himself to be pompous, overweening and pretentious,
and possessing an unbelievably precious and thoroughly reactionary view of
his calling.
Of course that is partly Lively's point. But it is a bold, not to say
foolhardy ambition to begin a major novel with more than 120 pages that
flesh out a a portrait of a thoroughly disagreeable main character. Yet when
the mode changes and Lively lets his own writing peep through there is never
quite the gust of fresh air the book so badly needs. He chronicles
Clearwater's love affair, and when the novel dips into SF comes up with the
invention of the Neurorch, which allows the brain's electrical impulses to
be synthesised as sound. It becomes the rage of New Venice, Clearwater
enthusiastically embraces it and finds his creativity cruelly, terminally
stifled.
Not before time, the reader might think. For a novel and a novelist so keen
to say something about music and the act of musical creation, Sing The Body
Electric is woefully short on insight. The cliches begin with the title and
barely let up; in moving forward almost 100 years musical evolution seems to
have stepped back 200 - Clearwater's Big Idea is to write a Sea Symphony.
There is no attempt to imagine what the next century might think of ours in
musical terms; no success either in making Clearwater or any other character
into thinking, feeling beings.
The Weather in Iceland also takes place in the future, though David
Profumo's tale of the declining of the upper classes is set only five years
hence. In 1998 Britain has been taken over by a military junta and a
disenfranchised aristocrat Richard Slide, Duke of London, has been exiled to
Switzerland, from where he can look back on his family's history with ironic
detachment. There are some useful picaresque touches, some boldly imagined
setpieces, but nothing to give Profumo's tale relevance or point, nothing to
make the reader care for Slide's lost world; unless, presumably, one shares
his world of privilege and nostalgia and feels a pang at its theoretical
passing.

JAMES JOYCE'S DUBLINERS: AN ANNOTATED EDITION edited by John Wyse Jackson
and Bernard McGinley Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 200 pages
JAMES JOYCE: REFLECTIONS OF IRELAND by Bernard McCabe and Alain Le Garsmeur
Little Brown Pounds 12.99, 156 pages
ULYSSES: THE 1922 TEXT edited by Jeri Johnson Oxford/Worlds Classics Pounds

LAST WEDNESDAY - June 16 - was Bloomsday. That was the day in 1904 when
Leopold Bloom walked through Dublin in pursuit of his business and desires,
encountered Stephen Dedalus and brought him to his home where Stephen met
Bloom's wife Molly. It is the best documented single day in the whole of
fiction and it has become a red-letter day in the literary calendar;
publishers like to release their latest Joyceana on Bloomsday.
But can there really be anything of any importance left to release? It was
way back in 1968 that Richard Ellmann introduced from Faber a hitherto
unpublished fiction from the hand of the master, and he suggested that this
would be the end:
'It seems probable (Ellmann wrote) that Giacomo Joyce will be the last of
James Joyce's published writings. He wrote it over half a century ago in
Trieste, at that stage of his life when he was completing A Portrait of the
Artist as A Young Man and was beginning Ulysses. Giacomo Joyce pivots
between the two books.'
It was only 16 pages long - as was the original notebook in Joyce's
handwriting in which it was discovered - but is, even so, complete. It is a
meditation by Giacomo - an Irish teacher of English in Trieste, clearly
Joyce himself - on one of his female pupils who is Jewish and who attracts
him. It is highly autobiographical.
But it now seems that Ellmann was wrong. Research on Joyce's life and his
papers has continued unabated since then. Another Joyce scholar, Danis Rose,
has been working for the past 16 years on a critical edition of Finnegans
Wake and he is convinced that there was another transitional work of
fiction, Finn's Hotel (the name of the hotel where Nora Barnacle worked when
she first met Joyce), composed in between Ulysses and Finnegans.
This was projected as a series of stories about Ireland and the myths of
Ireland. They were begun in 1923 and abandoned in 1924, and then later
incorporated into the larger work. Rose claims to have reconstructed this
lost work and publication of it was to have been this year's great Bloomsday
event. But not for the first time in the history of the publication of
Joyce's works, the project seems to have ground suddenly to a halt and is
for the moment on hold.
Even so, this year will see in the autumn publication of a 'new' book by
Joyce, his Political, Critical and Occasional Writings from Viking. Little
of the contents will come as a surprise to dedicated Joyceans. They will
include his early book-reviews, his student paper on Drama and Life (quoted
in Stephen Hero), his youthful salute to the dying Ibsen, as well as later
pieces on Wilde, Shaw and Home Rule. Many of these fugitive writings have up
to now been difficult of access. To have them all conveniently placed in one
collected volume at an affordable price should be a boon.
Meanwhile the work of unlocking the mysteries of the existing published
texts reaches new levels of thoroughness. Joyce's love of word-play grew and
grew until it became an obsession, a madness. There are signs of it even as
early as Dubliners. One of the two sisters who have just attended the death
of their brother, a priest, in the first story is guilty of malapropism. She
recalls a plan for a nostalgic ride that never took place:
'. . . he kept on saying that before the summer was over he'd go out for a
drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born
down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one
of them new-fangled carriages that make no noise that Father O'Rourke told
him about, them with the rheumatic wheels . . .'
In their new annotated edition of Dubliners the editors not only give us a
gloss on Irishtown, the poor area of Dublin south of the Liffey, they also
explain that the new-fangled carriages were not motor-cars but horse-drawn
carriages with pneumatic tyres. These tyres were invented by an Irishman, JB
Dunlop, who was later described by Joyce in Finnegans as 'the best tyrent of
ourish times'. They add too that Joyce would have seen an advertisement for
a patent medicine containing the word 'rheumatic' underneath an early
version of his story in The Irish Homestead.
Then they give us two facsimile pages from the issue of this popular
magazine for August 13 1904 containing the beginning of 'The Sisters'. It
appears under the heading of 'Our Weekly Story'. The text of the story here
differs significantly in places from the later published version we all
know.
Such exemplary exegesis takes up a great deal of space; the editors'
footnotes become in fact sidenotes; and with the illustrations and
afterwords at the end of each story, the material the editors contribute to
the book is more copious than the stories it elucidates. Anyone who just
wants to read the stories without fuss had better do so in the standard
paperback and use this as a reference book. It is invaluable as an insight
into the young Joyce's mind and to the condition of Ireland at the turn of
the century.
A less exacting way of getting to Joyce's source-material is to look at the
photographs by Alain Le Garsmeur that illustrate James Joyce: Reflections of
Ireland. Much remains in Dublin that he would recognise. North Richmond
Street, for example, a cul de sac used by Joyce as the setting for the story
'Araby', and where at one time the Joyce family lived. We have the opening
of the story on one page, and a photograph of the street as it is now on the
facing one. But we need to turn to the Annotated volume for an explanation
of the street's name (after Charles Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond) and to
discover there were at this time two Joyce families living there.
Le Garsmeur is a fine photographer, whether catching a customer at Mulligans
raising glass to lips or the grim grandeur of such landmarks as the Poolbeg
lighthouse and the Martello Tower where Ulysses begins. No area of Joyce's
work has proved more contentious than the text of this book. The edition
prepared by Hans Walter Gabler published in 1984 and currently on sale in
Penguin as 'The Corrected Text' has been heavily assailed for a host of
alleged inaccuracies and was the subject of a blazing long-running row in
the literary press on both sides of the Atlantic. The assault was led by an
American academic John Kidd, who is editing the whole thing afresh.
Meanwhile yet another American scholar, Jeri Johnson, currently Senior Tutor
at Exeter College, Oxford, has reissued the 1922 text of Ulysses published
by Sylvia Beach from her bookshop in Paris, Shakespeare &amp; Co. This edition
was superseded even in Joyce's lifetime and is now extremely rare. Judged by
the text of later revisions, errors abound; but when all is said, this
remains the text from which the novel made its initial impact. It is the one
that its first reviewers - TS Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Arnold
Bennett et al actually read - and from which they made their assessments.
With Johnson's full introduction, there is no reason at all why it should
not give a new generation of readers their first experience of this great
work.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Diary of a French civil servant - David Marsh
questions the memory of President Mitterrand's right-hand man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERBATIM by Jacques Attali Fayard, 958 pages
PRECISION, shrewdness, ability to concentrate on essentials: one would
expect to see a combination of all these characteristics in a top civil
servant. The same attributes, coupled with a head for figures, might be
found in a president of an international development bank. And they would
surely be necessary qualifications for a writer who attempts to explain a
tortuous period in European history.
When Jacques Attali, former senior adviser to President Francois Mitterrand,
now president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), publishes a diary of the first five years (1981-86) of the
Mitterrand era, the reader might, therefore, expect a feast of insight.
There is, indeed, plenty of information, spread over 958 pages. We read
transcripts from summit meetings, blow-by-blow tales of Elysee Palace
in-fighting, and President Mitterrand's views on life, death and Margaret
Thatcher. The president is always strikingly well-informed about world
affairs. Ronald Reagan, for instance, tells Mr Mitterrand in a letter on
March 23 1983 about the strategic defence initiative ('Star Wars')
programme. Mr Attali neglects to say that Mr Reagan also let a few million
others into the secret in a televised address that very same day.
The fare has the appearance of sumptuousness, but the trail of left-over
political souffle from the top tables at which Mr Attali has supped (and
taken notes) is often disappointingly thin. Where Mr Attali shows precision,
his procession of details tends to ramble. And where he seeks to demonstrate
shrewdness, the effect is undermined by question marks over whether he has
got his facts right.
The most interesting parts of the book have much relevance to current French
events: the tale of 1982-83 wrangling in the Socialist party over the
government's battle to keep the franc in the European Monetary System. In
other areas, however, there are far too many misspellings of foreigners'
names, especially Germans.
It is not unusual for a senior functionary to bring out an inside view of
the bastions of power. In 1991, Horst Teltschik, Mr Attali's opposite number
in the Bonn chancellor's office, published a day-by-day account of the
scramble towards German reunification. Mr Attali's Verbatim, however, is in
a class by itself, for three reasons.
First, the book is foolishly pretentious. Mr Attali, who for a decade
guarded the entrance to the president's office, writes in the preface that
he saw it as his 'duty' to print a historical record of Mr Mitterrand's
actions. A sequel is in store: this is just Volume One. Mr Attali gives his
personal guarantee of accuracy. 'I was the only person to hear many of the
remarks which I relate here, and my word thus stands alone against all
denials.' Curiously enough, within a few days of the book's release, four
former French ministers queried different parts of Mr Attali's account.
The second lacuna applies to Mr Mitterrand. Irritatingly, though perhaps
understandably, Mr Attali avoids fleshing out his portrayal with the detail
that would enable readers to penetrate the presidential mask. Mr Mitterrand
is quoted in abundance, always on matters on which he is wholly right.
Mr Mitterrand's powers of prediction were on display back in 1981, when,
according to Mr Attali, he told Chancellor Helmut Schmidt that the Soviet
Union would collapse before 1996. When the Soviet empire actually started to
tumble, between 1989 and 1991, Mr Mitterrand seemed curiously taken by
surprise. That was, presumably, simply an example of the wily old fox trying
to throw observers off the scent.
Mr Attali has caused a stir by including some opaque Mitterrand reflections
delivered to the author and Nobel prize winner Mr Elie Wiesel, who complains
he was reserving them for his own book. With artistic licence, Mr Attali
records the remarks as being made several years before they were uttered, on
the grounds that they related to matters on which the president does not
change his mind.
Mr Mitterrand is asked, for instance, about his boyhood: in passages of
endless variety, he describes how he was a lonely youngster who liked
country walks. With promising material like this to work on, it is small
wonder Mr Wiesel's own book has been a long time in the making.
The third reason why Mr Attali's tome is remarkable relates to the author's
present functions. Civil servants who write memoirs - provocative, amusing
or revelatory - generally do so after retiring from public office. Mr
Attali's account appears while he is halfway through a four-year term as
head of an international bank funded by taxpayers.
Civil servants are not journalists. Mr Attali's eagerness to lift the lid on
life in the fast stream can hardly increase anyone's desire to tell him
anything in confidence. Does Jacques still take his jotter whenever he jets
off to Azerbaijan, ready eventually to reveal the inside story of his
struggles on the eastern front? At least, if further Verbatims are in the
making, we can rely on Mr Attali one day to tell us what really happened in
the EBRD audit committee.

THE PASSION OF MICHEL FOUCAULT by James Miller HarperCollins Pounds 18, 490
pages
THE LIVES OF MICHEL FOUCAULT by David Macey Hutchinson Pounds 20, 600 pages
CONTEMPORARY French philosophers used to be banned from the Cambridge
University syllabus on the grounds that they were 'literary', therefore
bogus and faintly unhygienic. The career of Michel Foucault, who died in
1984 having succeeded Jean-Paul Sartre as the arbiter of French intellectual
haute couture, explains why.
For Foucault used philosophy to take the cult of the self to the limit; it
was the self-immolating programme of a tortured personality which left
behind a strange corpus of studied exaggerations and baffling arguments.
'I do not say things because I think them,' he once explained. 'I say them
rather with the aim of self-destruction, so that I will not have to think
them any more.' Even allowing for his irony and the lack of context, the
remark suggests that for Foucault philosophy was, after all, a form of
defecation.
Philosophy, like science, is conventionally supposed to be the study of
universals. How, then, should a biographer treat the life of a thinker who
says his life is part of his work and that his work is 'to become someone
other'?
David Macey, an English writer, has taken the traditional route and has
produced a heavily-researched, conscientious narrative which will appeal, I
guess, only to campus-bound Foucault-followers. The James Miller work is
something else altogether. Miller, an American academic, has taken up the
challenge of writing Foucault's life in terms the subject himself decreed -
as a kind of artistic creation. But to say 'artistic creation' gives the
wrong impression. Miller is not engaged on a cheerful, uplifting enterprise.
From the first pages describing Foucault's death from Aids it is obvious
that this is going to be the pathology of a homosexual, sado-masochist
intellectual. No doubt the philosopher's disciples will howl at the
desecration of their idol. But Foucault was an iconoclast and Miller is
entitled to wield the hammer.
He describes a brilliant but psychologically disturbed schoolboy from
Poitiers who went through the claustrophobic regime of the Ecole Normale
Superieure shunned by his fellows and burning with ambition. The suggestive
traumas of Foucault's childhood, fictionally recounted by his lover Herve
Guibert after the philosopher's death, could have been presented in evidence
here. But Miller keeps them to the end, a token of his even-handedness.
Foucault was obsessed with erotic pleasure which in his last years he
indulged in the gay bath-houses of San Francisco. He praised suicide,
regarded death as the final rapture and sado-masochism (the curious reader
will learn from Miller all he ever wants to know about S/M) as a benign,
ecstatic 'limit-experience' beyond the bounds of mere sex.
There is something heroic as well as revolting about Foucault's extremism.
He could be self-effacing, at least after he had achieved fashionable fame
with Les Mots et les Choses in 1966, and witty about his uncomprehending
audience. Anonymity was the best way of getting an intelligent reaction, he
once said, and he called his best-seller 'the most tiresome book I ever
wrote'. Yet there was a touch of the Herostratus about this philosopher who
crawled round the temple of knowledge laying packets of gelignite against
the pillars.
Foucault's philosophical godfather was Kant, but his inspiration derived
from de Sade, Nietszche and Heidegger. He was an extreme relativist who said
madness and sexuality were modern inventions, that prisoners should be
released, that rape was equivalent to a punch in the face, that morality was
a form of terrorism.
One critic compared his 1966 book to Mein Kampf. Others applauded his
literary verve but denounced his economy with the facts. Chomsky, the
American linguistics guru, described him as an alien from another planet:
'He struck me as completely amoral'. Yet his arguments have been
influential. Germany's leading philosopher, Jurgen Habermas, was surprised
to find how serious he was; 'I mean, he was a philosopher', he said after
meeting him.
As he grew older, the philosopher 'came out', in more senses than one.
Miller's exegesis, so damaging to begin with, unveils a kinder, calmer, more
impressive personality. Foucault turned to the early church Fathers and the
ancient Greeks to extol asceticism even while plundering his own body for
pleasure. He developed friendships and an almost Socratic benignity. Perhaps
he was seeking redemption after all.
Do we need people like Foucault? We probably do. He was a red hot poker
plunged into the cool, complacent stream of our rationalist thought-system.
Perhaps he will prove more important than that. But I doubt it.
Miller's provocative, occasionally disgusting, and compelling portrait will
be as much as most of us ever want or need to know about Michel Foucault. It
may not be a perfect likeness. But then Foucault should be the last to
complain.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: The writer who made himself hero - JDF Jones on a new
biography of Hemingway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIFE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES by James R Mellow Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25,
704 pages
NOT another biography of Ernest Hemingway? We are bound to be taken round
the old familiar circuit of First War heroics, suicide father, boozing, big
game and bullfighting, and then the sad decline, the hints of androgyny, the
suppressed homosexuality, the self-inflicted shotgun death. It is somehow so
easy to leave out that he was one of the few greatest writers of our
century.
It did not help that, from before the Second War until the 1961 death,
Hemingway encouraged a personality cult. He projected himself as hero -
macho Papa, hunter and deep-sea fisherman, wounded soldier, hard-drinking,
hard-loving man-of-the-world. There has ever since been too much confusion
between the Hemingway personality and his fictional protagonists - hence
some bad biography and a lot of misdirected lit. crit.
Far too many words have been devoted to relating Hemingway's dramatic life
to his dramatic works: matching the cast of The Sun Also Rises, for example,
to the pre-war expatriate community of Paris; his father's example as
suicide; his sexual proclivity for short-haired cross-dressing; the supposed
autobiography of A Farewell To Arms. (Hemingway actually spent only a few
weeks as a teenaged ambulance driver on the Italian Front in 1918 and ever
afterwards encouraged fantasies about his experiences there). The fact is
that Hemingway's image long ago became mythic-heroic, which has made it
difficult to separate fact from fiction, the author's life from the
novelist's gifts.
James Mellow confronts these problems rather well. His approach is eminently
sensible. He refuses to make too much fuss about the trauma of the baby
Ernest being dressed as a girl or his later vendetta against his mother; he
suggests that the 1918 affair with the older nurse Agnes von Kurowsky was
not so steamy, so intense, even so consummated, as would later appear in A
Farewell To Arms; he adds proportion to the story of first-wife Hadley
losing her husband's manuscripts; he analyses Hemingway's Republican
allegiances in the Spanish Civil War; he is particularly well-balanced about
the 1918 episode which has so exercised recent biographers - yes,
Hemingway's wounding was ridiculously dramatised, with his own help, but 'it
does not annul the fact that Hemingway in Italy had narrowly escaped death .
. . Commonsense argues that the ordeal had an effect on his life . . . The
confrontation of death proved to be one of his most vital and obsessive
themes.'
Mellow is good on the early days in Michigan, which were to produce the
wonderful Nick Adams stories. Indeed, he is generally good on the books,
especially the earlier ones - he has a better sense than most biographers
and critics of the difficulty of writing good fiction. His judgments are
sound: he signals out A Farewell To Arms and The Snows of Kiliminjaro as the
great masterpieces, and he explains why. He is savage about the seductive A
Moveable Feast in which Hemingway looked back on happy pre-war days with
Hadley in Paris - 'an old man's romantic idyll and a vengeful summing-up'.
The thesis - and here we nudge up against the problem - is that 'Nothing in
Hemingway's life, before or after, would match the importance of the years
that were centered in Paris (ie much of the 1920s). It would not be too much
to say that Paris changed Hemingway's life as a writer - for better and
worse, and significantly in both cases.' After Paris, 'whether intentionally
or unconsciously, Hemingway set about creating a new persona . . .' It seems
to be implied that this was the point when the rot set in. What we are not
told, and what is still very hard to understand, is why Hemingway developed
that new persona - if indeed it was new.
At this point in an engrossing but overlong book the reader begins to
understand that its structure is seriously askew. The balance is wrong:
one-half of this biography is consumed with the first 27 years, there is far
too much detail about the Paris period, and the later career is abbreviated
to a degree which seriously damages the value of what Mr Mellow has been
attempting.
Only in the closing 'Acknowledgments' does he explain that this is the final
volume in his trilogy about the Paris outcropping of the Modern Movement -
'a cultural revolution unequalled in its wide-reaching effects on Western
culture except by the Italian Renaissance . . .' (That is surely a touch
strong.)
Mellow locates Hemingway at the heart of this pre-war revolution and is at
his best in his detail of Stein, Pound, Fitzgerald, Anderson and all that
galere. He chooses to view Hemingway as a 'continental' novelist. He is
inadequately interested in what happened thereafter. Which seems a pity.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: Playing to a noisy New York gallery - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTING New Yorkers to spend a sporting day in silence stretches credulity
to unreasonable bounds.
Bobby Bonilla, for example, was just five games into a new career with the
New York Mets baseball team when he saw the home-made-sign in the crowd. It
said: 'Do Better, Ya Bum.'
Clearly then, worlds collide when the US Open Golf championship makes a
periodic visit to one of several designated sites that encompass the
outskirts of the city. This year, the venue is Baltusrol, which is in New
Jersey, just a 30 minute ride from the centre of Manhattan.
So who is winning in this contest between the brash New Yorker and the sober
Royal and Ancient game? Not surprisingly the former is. It is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Of course, golf would quickly become extinct if crowd noise became
excessive. Silence is not just desirable while a golfer is playing his
shots, it is absolutely essential. The game depends on strict obeyance of
this code of conduct.
But enforced silence can weaken interest. Many golf tournaments become
boring through lack of atmosphere. The sport is at its most fascinating when
the crowd is totally involved. At the Ryder Cup, for example, or the final
holes of any Open championship. And also, a US Open in New York.
The great players respond, too, when they have a crowd in thrall. Baltusrol
has already played host to two of the great US Opens. In 1967, a rather
plump young man called Jack Nicklaus finally cast off his image of outlaw to
Arnold Palmer's John Wayne, by shooting a record 72-hole total.
Nicklaus was back for more in 1980. This time, he was a washed-up icon. But
at 40 he rediscovered his best form, and the New Yorkers responded and the
final green was bathed in emotion. Nicklaus has no doubt that the reaction
of the crowd made this the most memorable of his 18 major championship
victories.
Already, this year's tournament has produced some lovely cameos. In
Wednesday's final practice round, John Daly, Fuzzy Zoeller and Robert Gamez
were paired together. At the short par three fourth, Zoeller's tee shots
finished in the water that fronts the green. He played a second ball, which
finished towards the back of the putting surface.
'That's where the pin will be on Sunday,' he said loudly.
'Always presuming you'll still be here on Sunday,' said a voice in the
crowd.
Daly shouted: 'Well, let's see if you can do any better, wiseguy.'
Daly has probably said this at tens of venues to tens of fans and they have
all gone red and mumbled something into the palm of their hand. Not now. Not
in New York.
The spectator stepped out of the crowd and into his dream. Zoeller gave him
a five iron.
'I need a four wood,' the man said.
'Don't be nervous, now,' said Zoeller.
The spectator hit a horrible shot that never came close to making the green.
'Not as easy as it looks, is it?' said Zoeller, as they both shook hands,
laughing.
In this tournament where 155 men set out with hopes and ambitions on
Thursday there walks also one boy. His name is Ted Oh. He is a 16-year-old,
from California, of Korean extraction, who came through the long and arduous
qualifying process. He is the youngest US Open competitor for 42 years. In
the changing room, the players' lockers are in alphabetical order, and Oh
was delighted to find his next to Nicklaus' or 'Mr Nicklaus' as he calls
him.
On Wednesday, Oh put himself down to play with Severiano Ballesteros. For a
few holes Ballesteros was totally absorbed in his own troubled world. But he
heard the roars of the crowd, forgot himself for a moment, and saw the play
of his young partner. All at once his features softened, he put his arm
around Oh's shoulders and told him about trying to keep the ball low under
the cross winds and how to play from the collar of rough that protects each
green. Then Ballesteros acknowledged the raucous cheers from behind the
ropes.
Of course, it can get out of hand. When one fan at the US Open at Shinnecock
Hills on Long Island, shouted the word 'Choker' at Greg Norman in 1986, he
was swiftly invited by the Australian to rendezvous behind the 18th green at
the end of his round.
Fortunately, the invitation was refused. But Norman has joined in the
applause this week, because he knows that New Yorkers discriminate most of
all in favour of the kind of colourful, adventurous golf that he specialises
in playing.
In those circumstances, the sport can more than stand a little whoopin' and
hollering.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: US falls for all-American German boy and his sport -
Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past 10 days, the performance of a German-born, German-raised soccer
star who plays in the German professional leagues and who barely speaks a
word of English has done more to raise the spirits of soccer fans in the US
than anyone since the great Brazilian Pele arrived in New York in the early
1970s.
In two games, Thomas Dooley, who was recently awarded US citizenship because
of his American GI father, scored three goals for the US national team and
led his newly adopted country to an improbable victory over England and a
highly creditable 4-3 loss to the world champions, Germany.
In the process, Dooley and his team mates turned the US Cup '93 (a four-team
contest arranged as a dress rehearsal for next year's World Cup) into a
genuinely competitive tournament, and awoke the interest of a surprisingly
large number of US sports fans, many of whom at this stage of the year would
normally be occupied with baseball, basketball, golf or giant dump-truck
racing.
The newspapers and weekly magazines afforded the tournament considerable
coverage, highlights were shown on the evening sports news broadcasts, and
the historic victory over the English earned an editorial in the Wall Street
Journal, cheekily entitled 'College Boys Shame England'.
The size of the audience for the only US Cup game that was shown live on
network television (US against Germany on ABC) surprised everyone: roughly
2.6m households watched the game, an audience larger than for some
regular-season baseball and ice hockey games.
Although the game was only up against a repeat of a National Geographic show
and an 'infomercial' on the other two networks, the ABC figures delighted
the organisers of next year's World Cup. Alan Rothenberg, head of World Cup
USA 1994, described the numbers as 'spectacular,' adding, 'I don't think
anybody dreamed we would get that.'
More importantly, the game itself won rave reviews. Hank Steinbrecher,
executive director of the US soccer federation, said that 'seven goals is a
pretty good advertisement for ABC and for soccer.'
Yet, in spite of the healthy audience, some critics still believe that
Americans will not turn on to World Cup soccer in large numbers next year.
In an acerbic column in the New York Times, Richard Sandomir, who writes
regularly on TV sports, insisted that soccer and television do not mix.
Soccer, he said, was a game played on too large a field to offer the
intimacy that makes sport attractive viewing. Sandomir also argued that
watching a 90-minute game with commercial breaks only at half-time was too
exhausting for the average US sports fan. (In a revolutionary move, ABC
broadcast the game commercial-free.)
Although Sandomir was writing clearly with his tongue in his cheek (soccer,
he said, 'takes place across enough tundra for a Dr Zhivago remake'), he has
a point. Americans are used to consuming their sport in easily digested,
bite-sized pieces - there have to be long enough gaps between each period,
quarter, inning, or whatever, to crack open another can of Budweiser, wolf
down another hot dog, visit the toilet and still have enough time before the
game resumes to curse your team.
Televised World Cup football is going to remain a hard sell, even though the
coverage of the US Cup games was surprisingly alert and sophisticated,
considering ABC had never done this kind of thing before. The coverage on
the cable station Sportschannel America, however, was less successful,
primarily because play was regularly broken up by commercials. This was
extremely disconcerting: 'Snackers, a chocolate bar that really satisfies'
cut back to the game 'Oooooh, England almost scored there.'
Fortunately, the attendances at the World Cup games should be impressive. If
250,000 people turn up for six games in a 'friendly' tournament such as the
US Cup, there will be plenty of enthusiasm when the real thing comes around.
Demand for domestically-available World Cup tickets has already proved
voracious and almost the entire allocation for US-based fans has been sold.
Last Sunday, Rothenberg said it was 'absolutely incredible' that stadiums in
New York and other big cities that morning had sold tens of thousands of
group tickets (costing anywhere between Dollars 140 and Dollars 400 for five
games) in the space of just a few hours. The promise Rothenberg made two and
a half years ago to sell every ticket for every game (a promise which at the
time drew cynical laughs from European journalists) looks as if it will be
kept.
Print and television commercials advertising World Cup 1994 have also begun
to appear, as the organising committee fires the first shots of a year-long
marketing campaign. The slogan for the commercials, 'Don't Miss It For The
World', is clearly aimed at feeding on the American enthusiasm for events
staged on the grandest of scales.
The nine stadiums, many of which will put their European counterparts (okay,
their English counterparts) to shame, will all be ready on time. Some of
them, such as Giants Stadium outside New York and the indoor Silverdome near
Detroit, where England and Germany will play tonight in the first indoor
international, will prove spectacular showcases for the game's premier
tournament.
All in all, the organisers are pleased with the progress of their
preparations, especially the success of the US Cup. 'We've had huge
attendances, a good television rating and a tournament that has come off
without any significant hitch . . . We're over the moon,' said Jim Trecker,
senior vice president of World Cup '94, a man who has clearly learned one of
the most important elements of the game of soccer - know your cliches.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: Kings of the lawn - Croquet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICKY SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS YOU get out the mower and casually contemplate a gentle turn through the
hoops, give a thought to top-level croquet. Great Britain played a Test
match in Australia this spring and won - for a record ninth time. The event
passed unremarked. The occasion also saw the debut of the US in top-class
croquet. They joined Britain, Australia and New Zealand for the first time
since Test matches were instituted in 1925. Their participation marked a
turning point in the performance of the British team.
'We lost on the first day,' says British Captain David Openshaw. 'It was
only after we beat the Americans on day five that we really got our act
together. Our team had decided that they not only wanted to win but to win
well. Privately I had my doubts about that. I thought it was too
aggressive.'
Openshaw is a croquet veteran of five test matches and has captained four of
them. He has a reputation in croquet for tenacity and relishes a close
fight. In this he was disappointed in Australia as the result, 17-3, was a
walkover for the British.
'It lacked the same thrill as the last test in New Zealand (in 1990) which
was much closer,' he says but he was justifiably pleased with his team's
success as three of the six players, John Walters, David Maugham and Chris
Clarke, were newcomers to test matches.
John Walters, 28, won the 1991 World Championship after nearly a decade of
unremarkable play. He battled through to the finals again last year in
Newport, Rhode Island, where he lost to Robert Fulford. Maugham, 23, is
distinguished by his accurate and consistent 'shooting' ability on the
lawns. In Australia, he set a test record by completing a 12-hoop two-ball
break against the veteran New Zealand champion, Bob Jackson.
Fulford, 23, is the undisputed top player in the world. He let slip a maths
degree at Durham to concentrate on croquet and since then, has toured the
world, earning a meagre living from his play. He made his first test
appearance in 1990, has won the World Championship twice and during his
recent world tour, won the New Zealand Open Championship, becoming the first
British player to do so in 30 years. He is keen on chess and bridge and
obsessed by tactics.
Fulford's style of play is unnattractive to watch but his ability is
undeniable. If croquet provided a fraction of the prize money of golf or
tennis, Fulford would be a rich man. His success is all the more impressive
because of the growing number of good British players.
With young talent such as this, backed by the experience of players like
Openshaw and Colin Irwin, playing his third test this year, it is small
wonder that the British are currently supreme in croquet. Yet both the
players and the game receive little recognition. There are two main reasons
for this. One is the ingrained image of croquet as nothing more than a
'vicious garden game', making it hard for anyone except a keen player to
take it seriously.
More important, is the muddled attitude of British croquet's governing body,
the Croquet Association. From its tiny corner in London's elegant Hurlingham
Club, the CA consistently fights a battle with itself over the nature of
croquet. It is a 'game' that even Lewis Carroll would have found hard to
conceive. On one side lies a craving for publicity and the necessary
sponsorship it brings. On the other, is the fear of crude limelight that can
follow fame and a rigid defence of British croquet's amateur status.
Endless discussions are held on promoting croquet the 'right way' which
invariably means not at all. Opportunities slip by. Sponsors find themselves
welcomed eagerly then forgotten in the stampede to find someone else to back
the latest tournament. Press coverage is haphazard and publicity - of any
kind - is usually greeted with suspicion.
However, as in all things concerning croquet, the unexpected can and does
occur. Just when the weighty flamingo of administration seems too much to
bear something happens to make it all worthwhile. The British Council is
staging an exhibition of International Croquet in Milan.
Milan is the headquarters of Italian croquet and, not surprisingly perhaps,
given the complicated tactics of their politics and economy, the Italians
appear to have a great ability for the game. Until July 21, the Milanese can
enjoy an exhibition of more than 100 photographs of croquet players from the
1860s to the present day and follow the fortunes of a game which is now
played from Palm Beach to Palermo.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: Rivals for the throne of the hair - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT UNTIL last Tuesday did we know whether defending champion Andre Agassi,
the No 8 seed this year, would be able to keep his appointment with
tradition by opening Wimbledon's Centre Court programme on Monday.
It was only after he had lost in three sets to the German left-hander
Charlie Steeb in the new grass court tournament in Halle, Germany, that the
23-year-old American could confirm he had no pain from the tendonitis of the
right wrist that had stopped him competing since April 9. When he pulled out
of the French Open last month Agassi said: 'Whatever happens, I am
determined to defend my title at Wimbledon - even if it means having
pain-killing injections.'
Cynics will suggest that Andre's determination to play has more to do with a
racket contract he has just signed than with pride of performance.
Nevertheless, the multi- million dollar deal should considerably relieve any
lingering pain.
More painful is Agassi's draw. The champion may hardly have time to play in
his new racket. His first round opponent is Bernd Karbacher who comes from
the same Iphitos Club in Munich as the 1991 Wimbledon champion, Michael
Stich. He has the same coach, too, New Zealander Mark Lewis.
Karbacher will be no pushover. Two months ago this powerful hitter beat
Boris Becker in Hamburg en route to the semi-finals. at the French Open he
overpowered as good a clay court player as former champion Michael Chang.
Unless the slightly overweight and ponderous Agassi can find his best form,
and with no match play that is unlikely, the fast improving German may end
his brief moment of glory. Andre could find himself returning to Las Vegas
sooner than he thought aboard his new jet. 'The flagship of American
Hairlines' as a pressroom wag christened it.
Becker, seeded four, also has one of the strong young Germans, Marc
Goellner, as his first opponent. When, in Nice last April, qualifier
Goellner, delivered his thunderbolts to win his first Tour title, with
victories over Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl, he sent shock waves through the
tennis community. This 22-year-old, Bonn, a genial giant who stands 6 ft 5
in in his socks, is an intimidating figure even when he smiles, which he did
a lot in Nice.
You could see the glint in Goellner's eye at practice this week when he
heard of his draw. Becker, short of match play and still a yard slow at the
Stella Artois last week, was less than thrilled. His response was to visit
David Lloyd's Club near Wimbledon for extra gym training.
All this action takes place in the top half of the draw where Pete Sampras
is the No 1 seed. Sampras is still my idea of the most likely winner in a
year when there is no outstanding favourite. Sampras has a reasonable draw
although he may have to play the Stella finalist Jamie Morgan in the second
round. As we saw at Queen's Club last week, when he saved two match points
in beating Edberg and then held four points to beat Stich before losing, the
quiet Australian with the heavy serve is a natural grass court player, even
though he hardly ever plays on the surface.
Sampras is supposed to meet Agassi in the quarter-finals but I expect to see
either Richard Krajicek (seeded nine) or Marc Rosset emerge to challenge
him. The probable second round meeting between these cannonball servers
should produce enough fireworks to make November 5 seem like a dark night.
If Becker survives Goellner's onslaught, as he should, there will be other
stern tests against Alexander Volkov, who was within two points of beating
Stich in the German's winning year, and Malivai Washington (14). Then, if
the seedings prove accurate, there will be another clash with Stich (6) in
the last eight. This, a repeat of last week's Stella quarter-final and also
the 1991 Wimbledon final, both won by Stich, would be an emotional match for
both. The leadership of the German game is at stake.
The lower half is dominated by Edberg (2), and last year's finalist, Goran
Ivanisevic (5), who should both rise above a plethora of clay courters and
emerge to the semi-finals. In spite of the Croatian's lack of match play due
to a stress fracture of the right foot and achilles problems (everyone, it
seems, is carrying an injury), I believe that he will improve as he starts
to pile up those aces - there were 206 last year] As usual the canny Edberg
has timed his effort well and there is the prospect of impending fatherhood
to inspire him, not to mention the lure of a third title and a prize of
Pounds 305,000 - just about enough to decorate the nursery.
Jim Courier (3) is supposed to be Ivanisevic's opponent in the last eight
but I shall be amazed if he survives to that stage. Drained from his
unavailing fight against Bruguera in the French final, Courier needs a rest.
Jason Stoltenberg, Wayne Ferreira (13), or an improving Swede called Henrik
Holm, whose father was an old opponent of mine, might oblige. What of Ivan
Lendl, the No 7 seed? Sadly, this most professional of athletes, now 33, is
losing his grip and finding it difficult to accept the fact. He might easily
disappear in round two at the hands of Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch who arrives
fresh from a first career win on the grass of Rosmalen in the Netherlands.
If I appear to have ignored the ladies it is only because they are so
predictable. In Paris this year the top eight seeds emerged to the last
eight for the first time since open tennis began in 1968. Barring injury or
illness, I believe the same may happen here. If it does, then the
quarter-finals would look like this: defending champion Steffi Graf (1)
against Jennifer Capriati (7); Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario (3) versus Conchita
Martinez (6); Jana Novotna (8) against Gabriela Sabatini (4); and Mary Joe
Fernandez (5) against Martina Navratilova (2) who, is looking for a tenth
title. I do not believe she will find it. Although we will probably have a
Graf v Navratilova final, I expect to see the German winning for the fifth
time.
Oh, and we should have a nice quiet year, too. There will be no grunting
from Monica Seles - she is absent - and no interruptions from the fierce Mr
Pierce who shouts and fights when his daughter Mary, the No 13 seed, is
playing. Jim, an American with a prison record, has been banned by the
Women's Tennis Council for the rest of the year. Wimbledon will follow suit.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Fishing: The venerable Venables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A CALLOW young man, I decided that my image as a fisherman needed a prop
to be rounded fully. So, I bought myself a pipe. The fact that my pipe and I
did not get on, and that it was discarded after one gruelling session of
match-striking, puffing, blowing, choking, poking and spitting, is beside
the point.
The point is that I wished to smoke a pipe because Mr Crabtree smoked a
pipe. He was never without it. Whether spinning for pike, float fishing for
roach or casting a fly for trout, there it was, clamped in a firm mouth
somewhere between square chin and clear, honest eyes.
Occasionally, he might take it out, to wet a knot or gesture at some
waterside phenomenon. But, most of the time, it was where it belonged, and
from its bowl issued a trail of smoke which seemed as essential an element
of the angling scene as his rod and reel.
I did not try to emulate other characteristics of Mr Crabtree's appearance:
his unchanging uniform of tweed suit, shirt and tie and battered, but
elegant, hat. Nor could I ever hope to match his prowess as an angler. He
never failed - literally - whereas I almost never succeeded.
Mr Crabtree and his son Peter (clad in shorts, jacket and tie but no hat)
inhabited an England of dreams: sylvan countryside running with clear
streams full of large, compliant fish. With their wicker creels, cane rods,
centrepin reels and homespun philosophies, they embodied a brighter, better,
simpler life that was all the more alluring for being so distant from
prosaic reality.
The spell cast by the duo was potent. They appeared first in strip cartoon
form in the Daily Mirror late in the 1940s. And their collected adventures,
published under the fine, old-fashioned title Mr Crabtree Goes Fishing, sold
more than 2m copies in the 1950s and a good few more when resurrected for
re-publication four or five years ago.
Their creator in those distant days was Bernard Venables, who has slipped in
and out of the angling world ever since. Now, after a long silence and aged
86, he has made a comeback with his Illustrated Memoirs of a Fisherman
(Merlin Unwin, Pounds 19.95).
Many years ago, I remember, Venables presented a series of programmes on
television called Anglers' Corner. I can see him now: jutting chin, wispy
beard and artistically windswept hair, consulting some weatherbeaten Kennet
ancient on the best spot for perch; then using tackle of the Crabtree school
to pull out three or four bristling stripeys, each of 2lb and more, and all
in quarter of an hour.
I did not know then that Venables had fathered my spiritual tutor, Mr
Crabtree; nor that he had founded what was then my weekly dose of
instruction, the Angling Times. But I did become aware of him through the
appearance and brief, glorious life of what remains, 25 years after its
death, the best fishing magazine ever produced in this country - Creel.
Creel reflected, in the range and variety of its coverage, the Catholic
tastes of Venables, who was its founder and first editor. I have all the
numbers with me now, and I still marvel at them. Flicking through the pages,
I roam from the Gulf of Mexico to the mountains of Slovenia, from Lake
Rudolf to the loughs of Ireland, from reed-fringed Norfolk broads to the
rocky torrents of Snowdonia.
Most of the great names are here: Reg Righyni on salmon, Clive Gammon on
bass, BB on catching a ferox, Fred Buller on pike, and Bernard Venables on
just about everything. His characteristically purplish prose and
full-blooded, naturalistic paintings are everywhere. The photography, the
writing, the presentation in the jargon and the production values of Creel
have never been matched. Not surprisingly, it went bust and Venables drifted
off the stage.
His new book is an indispensable document for anyone interested in the
development of fishing post-war. It is also a somewhat tantalising affair.
Venables jogs through the principal landmarks of a long career, leaving
enormous holes in the narrative and revealing little of himself. For my
taste, there are not enough fishing stories and the numerous paintings do
not seem as evocative as his work of yore.
Nevertheless, Merlin Unwin is to be congratulated for extracting this book
from a remarkable old man. And he has made his customarily handsome job of
it. For anyone interested in further exploration of the Venables oeuvre, I
would recommend back numbers of Creel, his best book, A Fisherman's
Testament - and, above all, the deathless Mr Crabtree.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Gardening: How to curb rampant roses - Robin Lane Fox looks
at how the French deal with roses when they go on the rampage and finds that
it is, after all, quite a pretty sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSES ARE now everywhere and the great flush which we expect in late June is
two or three weeks early. My indicator is the single rose Complicata,
probably because I grow too much of this extremely uncomplicated plant in
rough-mown grass. It was a great favourite with Arthur Hellyer, the FT
gardening writer who died last year, and in average years, we expected it to
peak around July 1.
It is a big, easy shrub and it will even grow upwards into fruit trees, as
you can now see at Mottisfont in Hampshire. This year, my index of the
season is almost past its best, two weeks ahead of time. In all this
earliness, the older roses are leading the way and you need to move quickly
if you want to visit gardens at their best: I do, however, find that the
earliest are those in direct sunlight and that the Bourbons are still later
than accelerated albas, damasks and gallicas.
Among festoons of flower on my favourite climbers, on Paul Lede and the flat
white Sombreuil, I am relishing some contrary European wisdom. I have the
old Royal Horticultural Society handbooks on roses. They were absolutely
adamant, those experts of the pre- and post-war era: never allow a rose's
stems to criss-cross, chafe or obscure each other. Pruning should occur in
early winter or early spring, although the merits of one season over the
other sustained an argument for nearly 50 years. Whenever we do it, we
should, however, follow the rules: keep those roses fanned out on the wall,
open out the centre to the light and cut out excessive stems from as low a
point as possible. On one awful fault all of Britain's experts agreed: never
clamp the stems of the rose into a bunch and never ever use staples to fix
them back on to a post or support. There are old illustrations, deploring
this hangman's tactic.
For years, therefore, I have pricked myself in cold winters: I have cut out
long canes from the ramblers and struggled to open out the centre of Mrs
Herbert Stevens in late February. Then, I travelled and noticed a curious
thing. In one of the world's best-kept rose gardens, they are breaking all
the RHS rules and are none the worse for it.
In ancient Egypt, people used to marry their sisters; in India, wives jumped
on to their husband's funeral pyre. Society survived: in Bagatelle, the
supreme oasis of Paris, the robust climbing roses are being stapled on to
posts, chafed and treated as if they are blackberries, trying to escape.
They have been treated in this way for years. In spite of the RHS rules,
roses like Guinee or New Dawn have made huge trunks with old, cantankerous
thorns: in June, they are covered in flowers and, if their stems offend
them, the French simply cut them out. They do not bother with the Great
Pruning Debate about the relative merits of November and February. They cut
them after flowering; they cut them again in autumn if they look a mess;
they start from the principle that the roses must look trim and neat and,
except in the months when they are forming buds, they simply cut them to
keep them tidy. They stand at the opposite extreme to that other heretic
whose results encouraged me to disobey in the opposite direction: in
Suffolk, the great rosarian, the late Humphrey Brooke, never pruned any of
his roses at all unless they died.
Two years ago, I first saw this Bagatelle treatment and was not sure that I
believed it: in the long term, surely, research would show that the RHS was
right. I have just been back to check again. Caroline Testout is bursting
with flower and Alberic Barbier is almost looking tidy. Perhaps it is the
French climate; perhaps it is the local genius of Bagatelle, but their roses
are extremely happy, having escaped from the National Rose Society's
guidelines.
In this new straitjacket, three French methods impressed me: the stake, the
iron cage, and the rope. Roses are clipped and crucified on each of them:
nobody is to be seen knitting below these scaffolds, and yet the heads of
flower roll happily by the thousand. Would it also work for Climbing Lady
Hillingdon?
Each method is characterised by a major breach of RHS wisdom: by British
standards, the roses are seriously over-planted. The preference is for thick
wooden stakes, about a 1ft wide and 6in thick, with none of the frilly
ironwork of an English Sloane's metal arbour. On to the two main sides of
this post, a climbing rose is planted both front and back and the two plants
are then stapled on to the wood and left to 'faire le criss-cross', on the
understanding that if any stems flop out of control, they will either be
pruned immediately or stapled back into the main tangle.
As for the criss-cross, you have never seen the equal, a sort of rosarian
cat's cradle in whic everything chafes and refuses to fan out. In Britain,
we limit our roses to one stake for each plant and take the greatest care to
prune them in winter in case the summer daylight becomes obscured.
The iron cage is an alternative with real potential. In Britain, we use iron
cages around young trees to keep off deer, malevolent rabbits and other
people's teenagers and dogs. In France, cages are used like tall lamp posts
on to which climbing roses can be trained to a height of 10 or 12 feet. You
need to drive three or four lengths of metal into the ground arranging them
round a bed of a yard's diameter, cut as a circle. In the middle,
over-planting prevails again because the French rule is to plant three or
four climbing roses of serious vigour, defying the RHS rules of density. The
roses then run up to the top of the cage and are clipped, comme vous voulez,
without any nonsense about November or February. The result, this month, is
a great cone of flower, like a stage designer's dream for a summer set. If
you need height and emphasis in a summer garden, you should think very
carefully about the scope for three or four different climbers, trained up a
secure circle of metal posts.
The rope trick appeals to me particularly. In Britain we do grow roses on
ropes and you can see them superbly at Hyde Hall in Essex, one of the great
post-war rose sanctuaries which is open to the general public. I was brought
up to believe that roses on ropes were all very well for Queen Mary's
rose-garden in Regents Park or the National Rose Society's display garden in
Hertfordshire, but they were not a feature which civilised gardeners would
want at home.
Swags are over the top and recommended rope-varieties are vilely coloured.
Who wants a Kordes climber with those boring glossy leaves and harsh red
flowers, turning purple in hot weather on a spliced mainbrace at eye-level?
The whole inclination of a rose with spirit is to grow off a rope, not on to
it: do we have to wait to cut it until the Great Pruning Debate is in season
and finally, we can tidy it up for the year?
At Bagatelle, they are more broad-minded. Their rope-varieties include
rampant white-flowered favourites like The Garland or Alberic Barbier and
they are spaced two or three yards apart.
These roses are amazingly rampant in Britain, but in France they merely
prune them as soon as they have flowered and whenever else they need: as a
result, they run like neat little Banksians along ropes of the sort of
superior thickness which cordons off partygoers and keeps them out of
privileged enclosures. Reared on the RHS, I would have declared it
impossible: these varieties are much too rampant, whereas the right sort for
ropes should be a winner of the President's Trophy with beastly modern
leaves and flowers in a sharp shade of carmine.
Vast possibilities now reopen. If ropes will support the prettiest old
ramblers and summer pruning suits them, why not edge a long flight of steps
with a hand rail of white Bobbie James, pruned in to shape?
In France, Felicite and Perpetue are totally happy, being martyred and
chopped in July after flowering: could we not direct them on ropes along the
backs of borders or as edging to main lines of view?
In the gardens of my Old Vicarage, I can now string up a Rambling Rector, an
atheist's rope-trick for one of the loveliest white roses in the book. The
art is not to raise the ropes too high or to connect them to anything made
of dipped red cedar or treated with that awful golden tinge. Pruning can
then take place in summer after flowering, not in winter when you catch a
chill. As for criss-crossing, let us merely say that in France they do not
seem to mind it as much as the old experts suggested.
In short, the rules are relative. Did those who designed them in pre-war
Britain ever cross the Channel and give French habits the benefit of the
doubt? Or do the rules reflect the mentality, class and character of those
who draw them up, country by country?
I am now turning ropes and considering stakes as well as expensive arches,
next year, I will enter the Great Pruning Debate but my contribution will be
in late July, with the advice to get out promptly and prune anything in the
rose bed which is not capable of a second autumn season.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Motoring: Four-track minded - Stuart Marshall looks at the
Spanish-built Nissan which is ready to join the swelling ranks of four-wheel
drive vehicles in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING sales of on-off road 4x4s are like one of the vehicles being driven
well across rough country; in a word, unstoppable. Europeans are expected to
be buying them at an annual rate of 350,000 by next year. In Britain, the
recession has done nothing to blunt sales. They have been rising for six
years and went up by no less than 36 per cent in 1992.
Britain's best seller is the Land Rover Discovery. But Nissan, which made
its first 4x4 in 1951, only three years after the Land Rover was launched,
is already big in Europe. It is confident the Spanish-built Nissan Terrano
II, which is also to be marketed by Ford as the Maverick, will make it
bigger still.
Shrewdly, Nissan is calling Terrano II an all-road rather than an on-off
road vehicle. It knows that the last thing most buyers will have in mind in
plunging around axle-deep in mud. In Nissan's sights are buyers living in
towns and suburbs but having an active interest in country life, even if it
may only be walking dogs on the downs, going to a point-to-point or towing a
caravan.
Some Terrano IIs will, it thinks, be used on weekdays as car substitutes for
commuting and business motoring, for taking children to school or going to
the shops. (Just like the average Range Rover, Discovery or Shogun, in fact,
though Nissan is too polite it say so).
Terrano II (for which read Ford Maverick because only the badges are
different) was developed in Europe for European buyers. There are short and
long wheelbase models with three-door or five-door estate car bodies. The
longer one (pictured) feels more car-like on roads than almost any other 4x4
I have driven though the short-wheelbase model has a choppy ride on all but
the smoothest roads.
Like the Mitsubishi Shogun and Isuzu Trooper they have independent front
suspension. There is a coil-sprung back axle, selectable four-wheel drive
(on hard surfaces you use rear-wheel drive only) and 5-speed gearboxes plus
a high/low transfer box. This provides ten gears in four-wheel drive, five
in two-wheel drive. There is no automatic transmission option.
Engines, both four cylinder, are a petrol 2.4-litre and 2.7-litre turbo
diesel. Although the diesel develops less power (100 horsepower against the
petrol engine's 124) it pulls so much harder at moderate revolutions that it
feels at least as muscular. I preferred the diesels, which most buyers will
go for, on and off road.
At an indicated 90 mph/145 kph and 4,000 rpm on the autoroute, a 5-door was
even quieter than the petrol engined version. The official figures suggest
an average 24.5 mpg (11.5 l per 100 km) for the petrol, 28.5 mpg (9.9 l per
100 km) for the diesel. Used mainly in town and on local roads, not
motorways, the diesel's economy benefits would be greater.
For comfort, light controls, noise levels and ambience, Terrano II and
Maverick are more like a Nissan Primera than one of their on-off road
rivals. All have a limited slip rear differential and power steering. The
up-to-seven seat, long-wheelbase five-doors come with a third face-forward
bench folding into the load floor.
Terrano II LX and the standard Maverick include most car-type goodies. The
posh Terrano II SLX and Maverick GLX also have a powered sunroof, heated
mirrors and, at extra cost, air conditioning.
Prices, due to be announced next week, are expected to be in the Pounds
15,000 to Pounds 20,000 range. This will put Terrano II and Maverick in
between the Daihatsu Sportrak, Suzuki Vitara and Vauxhall (Opel) Frontera
Sport and the heavier metal of Discovery, Shogun and Trooper. Probable
buyers will include young and image-conscious men and women priced out of
their GTi hot hatchbacks by the insurance companies.
The tail-in-air styling grates on me a bit and I see little point in having
a four-wheel drive to use solely on the road. Having said that, a
long-wheelbase turbo-diesel Terrano II or Maverick might fit easily into my
country town lifestyle. And if we ever had a really bad winter again, its
4x4 traction would be worth its weight in gold.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Property: Big house, low price, the charm of Ireland -
Gerald Cadogan finds a wealth of choice in a relaxed environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GO TO Ireland for a holiday, and you may stay for life. Many Georgian houses
still lurk behind estate walls, at prices that are attractive to UK buyers.
Although the acres may be fewer than they were 100 years ago, because land
has been sold off to pay bills - or the Land Commission has redistributed it
 -you should have no difficulty finding a fine property.
Perhaps an 18th century house - or an 18th-century-style house built in the
19th century, with stable yard, outbuildings, walled garden, land and
fishing may be to your taste. Even with 6 per cent purchase tax, there is
more for your money in Ireland - and no domestic rates or council tax.
If you like a different pace of life, Ireland has masses to see and do.
Although the numbers of British visitors has fallen in recent years, do not
be afraid if you are English. The insoluble saga of Northern Ireland has an
extremely limited effect on day-to-day life in the republic.
The economy looks to be climbing slowly out of recession and, after a
traumatic spell in the wake of the British pound's devaluation, the Irish
punt has settled at so close to par with the pound that we can show the
guide prices with a Pounds sign that holds for both countries.
Interest rates are down and, as in Britain, devaluation has given farmers
more Green Punts through the EC's payments. Farmland prices are holding up
well.
The Irish country house market was buoyed during the UK property boom as
English buyers saw what good value Ireland offered. With heavy falls in
prices during last year and the early part of this, it is even better value.
Travel between Heathrow and Dublin has improved with three companies (Aer
Lingus, BA and British Midland) competing for travellers, while EC grants
are financing new major roads.
This makes it feasible to live in Ireland and commute to England for,
perhaps, a shortened office week. One might also be able to work from home
by fax or modem, and realise a considerable saving compared with buying a
similar house in, for example, Hampshire.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, together with Hamilton Osborne King (HOK), is selling
Rathmore Park in Co Carlow by auction on Friday at a disclosed reserve of
just Pounds 230,000 for a Georgian house with park, stables and fishing on
the Slaney. A higher price will be no surprise. Last week HOK sold the
Georgian-style Coolclogher House in Co Kerry at auction at Pounds 420,000,
as against an expected Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000, attracting domestic
and foreign bidders.
Auctions are regular in Ireland and do not carry the 'it could not sell
privately' stigma - as can happen in the UK. The auction reveals which
people are really interested in the property. If it has not sold, they can
be approached afterwards for private negotiations. If it does sell, there is
the advantage that everybody knows the price.
The most expensive house on sale in Ireland is a Georgian stately manor with
reception rooms designed by Robert Adam and a remarkable collection of Asian
conifers and rhododendrons. Headfort House at Kells in County Meath is a
convenient 40 miles from Dublin, with 860 acres including 11 cottages, a
shoot and fishing on the Blackwater. This great house is now leased to a
prep school. The buyer can move into a wing, but will have to wait five
years for the whole of the big house, which Keane Mahony Smith (KMS) offers
at Pounds 4m.
Much cheaper is Avonmore House near Dublin in Co Wicklow at Pounds 1.75m
from HOK. It is a lovely Georgian house with ornate plasterwork and comes
with a heated swimming pool and stable yard with 18 boxes. And Pounds 1m
secures the Noan estate of 550 acres (again a Georgian house) in Co
Tipperary, from KMS in Cork and Jackson-Stops &amp; McCabe.
A rare Georgian house near Howth at the north end of Dublin Bay, with a fine
windswept, seaside garden and 10 acres in all, is Drumleck which Lisney
offers at around Pounds 1.5m. In Co Galway in the west Heaslip is selling
Clydagh House at Headford on Lough Corrib, which still has free fishing for
salmon and trout. The Georgian house has 146 acres for around Pounds
750,000.
Near Mullingar in Co Westmeath and convenient for Dublin is Gigginstown, an
1840s Georgian delight in grey stone and white paint, set in parkland. It is
not overwhelming - Robert Ganly, of Ganly Walters, agents with Strutt &amp;
Parker calls it 'a grand honest house' - but it does have fine plasterwork
and a main staircase that splits into two at the half-landing. The vendor,
who is leaving after 58 years there, says she is 'lucky to have been a
tenant for life' and looks for a sympathetic buyer. The price is around
Pounds 580,000.
In the Troubles in the early 1920s big houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy
were burnt down - a powerful theme in the writings of Molly Keane and
William Trevor. I had assumed that they were left as ruins. Wrong. The
government gave compensation (as today in Northern Ireland) and some were
rebuilt in a 1920s Georgian style embellished with Bauhaus or Art Deco
touches. Molly Kean describes one in Loving and Giving. 'As you see,
everything straight from Harrods - the Customs must have been enormous.'
These large houses tried to assert the old regime. Today, like the huge
princely palaces in India built in the 1920s-1940s, their symbolism seems an
irony of history. But they are intriguing homes. Ganly Walters and Jordan
has recently sold Saunders Grove, at Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, for Pounds
750,000, about 9 per cent below the guide price. Now Gunne offers Milestown
at Castlebellingham in Co Louth, north of Dublin on the way to Belfast, a
house of solid comfort in tip-top shape with gardens running down to the
river Glyde, at more than Pounds 500,000.
Ireland has a good supply of large-ish houses in the Pounds 200,000-Pounds
400,000 range, as the agents will be happy to tell you. One, Weir House,
which is splendidly placed on Woodstown Beach with views over Waterford
Harbour, is offered by JSM and Palmer Rohan for more than Pounds 200,000.
Some are glebe houses, the Irish term for old rectories of the (Anglican)
Church of Ireland (not of the Roman Catholics) as at Moyglare outside
Maynooth in Co Kildare, on sale for around Pounds 400,000 from JSM with
Coonan.
Castles are also integral to Irish life, reflecting the endless troubles the
island has suffered. Mount Nugent in Co Cavan is a restored 16th century
tower house (keep) offered by JSM and Armstrong at over Pounds 200,000, with
17 acres, two cottages and a jetty on Lough Sheelin. Priced at Pounds
700,000 is the romantic-looking Cloghan Castle in Co Offaly with duck
shooting on the nearby Shannon, from JSM.
Two other fairytale castles are the firm's Strancally Castle (1820s built by
the Pain brothers) in Co Waterford (Pounds 800,000-Pounds 850,000), and
Dromore in Co Kerry, with fishing on the Blackwater and netting in the
Kenmare. HOK and Cheveley Johnston suggest a price around Pounds 400,000.
The Mill House on the River Slaney at Clonegal, Bunclody in Co Wexford is an
idyll. Water races through the rapids outside the 18th century woollen mill
and still turns the wheel. I sat in the picture window of the old weaving
loft and watched the river. Sitting longer, I should have seen kingfishers
and herons, and last week a pair of otters played on the other bank.
The grounds are wooded and rocky with rare azaleas and rhododendrons. The
only noise is the river. Ganly Walters, Strutt &amp; Parker and JSM offer this
paradise at Pounds 325,000.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Siberian odyssey with no end in sight: Gillian Tett on the
plight of a group of American families who went to Russia to adopt children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year Tom and Cathy, a well-meaning couple from Sacramento,
California, decided to adopt a Russian baby. They armed themselves with
official papers,a video camera and plenty of American food, and set off.
Another 13 families joined them each in a separate quest for a new child.
In the event, their supplies of patience - and peanut butter - proved barely
enough. What Tom and Cathy - they do no want to be too closely identified -
had planned as a brief mercy mission turned into an odyssey that led them
into battle with bureaucrats and local political leaders - before finally
dumping them, in uncertain exile, in Novokuznetsk, a Siberian mining town.
'What we were wanting to do was give some hope to a child. We never thought
it turn out like this,' said Tom, when I ran into them in the seedy
corridors of the town's only official hotel. With their sneakers, T-shirts
and money belts, they looked deceptively like an American tourist group -
except that there was little reason why any tourist would ever chose to
visit, let alone stay, in a town as unlikely as grimy, smog-filled
Novokuznetsk.
Tom and Cathy's endeavour was far from unique. In the last two years, as the
former Soviet republics have been flinging open their doors to the west,
Russia - along many other East European countries - has become increasingly
attractive to Western couples desperate to adopt children. The trend seems
to be growing. According to the American embassy in Moscow, around 100
children are now being officially adopted by Americans each month, with a
much larger, but unknown, number being adopted by other nationalities - and
through illegal channels.
Under Russian law, children can only be adopted by foreigners if they have
handicaps or incurable diseases - although in practice, the regulations have
often proved distinctly elastic, especially in the face of the large fees
that many Russian adoption agencies are now demanding.
'Many of the children who have been given Soviet certificates saying they're
handicaped are not really bad at all,' says Katharine Allen, a doctor at the
American medical centre, who examines most of the children adopted by
American parents.
But for Tom and Cathy, members of the Sacramento Warehouse Ministries
Church, bending the rules did not sit easily with their humanitarian ideals.
Indeed, as their group earnestly explained, one reason for choosing to adopt
in remote Novokuznetsk had been because it was outside the grasp of the
semi-legal adoption agencies that are now dominating the 'business' in the
big cities and demanding five figure fees.
'We came out here to do things properly,' said the pastor who spoke for the
group. 'We are doing everything we can according to their laws.'
But in a country where every region is acting as a law unto itself, finding
who administered the 'laws' had been extremely difficult. At their first
stop in Moscow, they had theoretically received full rights of adoption -
and as far as the grateful orphanage and local health ministry had been
concerned, that had been enough. Within days of arriving in Novokuznetsk,
the group had been allocated 20 handicapped children, and had set about
'bonding' with their new offspring.
'We went and bought them toys and tried to talk to them,' explained Jean, a
nurse, as she sat clutching a polaroid photograph of a thin, pale child that
she insisted was now 'hers.'
But then the local education ministry stepped in: according to its
understanding of the 'law' the papers were insufficient and the health
ministry did not have the right to approve adoptions.
'Many people here do not like to think that Americans can come in and buy up
our children. We feel that it lessens our national pride,' admitted one
local bureaucrat, who, like most of the officials involved in the saga, was
reluctant to give her name.
Letters were exchanged, visits made and intense back door political lobbying
started. Then, as the weeks dragged on and the negotiations collapsed the
local administration banned the Americans from the orphanage.
'We sit here and we know the children are so close, but we can't do
anything,' continued Jean, shakily, as she sat on a broken armchair in the
hotel, almost a month after she had first arrived in Novokuznetsk.
So what had they been doing with themselves?
There was a pause. Their faces began to reflect a little of the strain,
exhaustion and culture shock of previous weeks. For about half the families,
this trip had been their first real chance to find a child. Few of the group
had ever travelled before outside America and none spoke Russian.
'We sit here, go for walks, wait,' muttered Tom, a sales representative by
profession.
'Oh and go shopping,' said another.
Shopping? I wondered.
'There's nothing to buy. We found some baby clothes when we arrived - but
they were winter baby clothes so now they're no good,' added Jean sadly.
'Oh - and Tom's making a video of the trip. He wants to have something to
show his little girl when she grows up,' added another. 'Well, that's what
we hope.'
There was not much more to say. They murmured vaguely about 'growing
experiences', I gave them my old newspapers - and then gratefully flew out
of Novokuztnetsk on the next flight.
A month later I phoned their headquarters in Sacramento to find out what had
happened. The reply was pained. The group had returned to America after two
months. Only three of the children had been allowed to go with them, with
promises made that more could be collected later this year.
'We are not bitter,' Sue Westrom, programme director from the Sacramento
Christian Adoption Programme, insisted evenly. 'We understand the problems
because some people have abused the system in the past.'
But what were the families like Tom and Cathy, who had waited for so long,
going to do?
Continue to wait, and hope, she said - and then go back to Novokuznetsk in
the autumn, armed with yet more paper work, video tape, and perhaps a fresh
supply of peanut butter.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Stonehenge: new plans for the rocks of ages - Gerald Cagodan
on how best to preserve Britain's greatest monument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CAGODAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USUAL constraints on visitors will be in force at Stonehenge this summer
solstice. That means no Druids, no 'travellers', and no special access at
dawn on Monday when the midsummer sun rises over the Heel Stone along the
axis of the Avenue, the processional way outside the great circle of
standing stones in Wiltshire, as it has been doing now for more than 4000
summer solstices.
The long, mysterious history of Stonehenge, which began probably over 5000
years ago, has one advantage for 1993 AD. It puts into perspective the slow
progress of English Heritage (EH) towards solving the problems of how to
preserve, conserve and present the monument. Because it is so old and
because it is unique, it demands that we find the best possible solutions.
Nine years ago, when EH was formed, under Lord Montagu as chairman, it
announced that Stonehenge was a top priority. It also badly underestimated
how long it would take to tackle it. Five more years is a fair guess. What
is the position now, and what are the prospects?
Nobody would dispute that its present surroundings, on a triangle of land
between two busy roads (the A303 and A344), and its squalid visitor
facilities, inadequate parking and gloomy post-war concrete buildings, do
not honour Europe's premier prehistoric monument. EH has long suggested that
the A344 be closed and grassed over and the present visitor centre be moved
far enough away that visitors have to walk to the stones.
These proposals would do wonders to restore Stonehenge to its proper
position as the heart of a downland landscape crammed with prehistoric
monuments - especially the important burial barrows - put there precisely
because they were next to the holy place of power. At the same time visitors
would have time to get over the travails of the drive and to adjust to the
breadth of history as they walk like pilgrims to Stonehenge.
To run greater Stonehenge - the whole spread of the the site - which mostly
belongs to the National Trust but is partly government property, a
Stonehenge Trust is now proposed.
Where is the best place for the visitor centre? EH long favoured the
Larkhill site to the north, a 1km walk to the stones, and displayed the
winning plans of Edward Cullinan (designer of the visitor centre at
Fountains Abbey) at an exhibition at the Royal Institute of British
Architects in London in January. Now, however, things are not so clear.
There are problems with the approach road to Larkhill: if it is from the
north, the Ministry of Defence, which oversees many military manoeuvres in
the area, is not happy; and if it is from the west, it may affect the
underlying archaeology. So public consultation is under way again to find
the best site and a present exhibition at Stonehenge shows eight possible
areas, rating them by the following (perhaps surprising) criteria:
How much will the sites damage the archaeology
How far are they from the public highway
How long would the walk be to the stones
What is the cost (estimated at between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 16.5m)
How impressive is the approach - a class which Larkhill and the New King
Barrows (east of Stonehenge, enjoying the same marvellous view as you have
driving on the A303 from Amesbury) wins easily.
Visitors can fill in a questionnaire and send it to EH, which will also have
the guidance of a professional seminar at the Society of Antiquaries in
Burlington House, London, on July 6. After that, EH and the National Trust
will choose a site, re-instruct Cullinan and the landscape architects
Livingston Eyre, submit a planning application, be ready for the inevitable
public inquiry and await eventually the decision of whoever is then
secretary of state for the environment. Five years for all this is probably
not enough.
In the meantime, who will pay for the work? EH, under Jocelyn Stevens, its
new chairman, says that it will be looking for outside funding, perhaps
similar to the Sainsbury supermarket family's gift of the new wing of the
National Gallery in London. Or we may by then have a government that sees
Stonehenge as a crown jewel of our national heritage, quite apart from the
money its visitors inject into the economy, and therefore will fund it
wholly from public money, or from the National Lottery.
The A303 road is the other big problem for Stonehenge: it runs too close.
The Department of Transport has proposals and is willing to fund them.
Either keep the present route and put it in a tunnel next to the stones
(known as the 'yellow' solution) or re-route it over 1km to the south (the
'grey' solution), which saves the stones and should do less damage to the
archaeology around. The latter is preferable, as the President of the
Society of Antiquaries, Professor Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University, has
informed the DOT.
At present, he says: 'As the cars whizz by, I think of Oscar Wilde's Ballad
of Reading Gaol - 'Yet each man kills the thing he loves'. The whole
Stonehenge problem is a perfect microcosm of all the problems we face at
such sites around the world. If we can solve them here, we should be able to
do it anywhere'.
What problems? Preserving the place; maintaining it; presenting it;
controlling visitor access so that it is not spoilt; controlling the
transportation that brings people. Can Britain do it? I hope so. These holy,
mysterious stones deserve the best we can give them.

FT  19 JUN 93 / A waterfront for snobs: Patti Waldmeir enjoys herself at
Cape Town's spruced-up harbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<TEXT>
THERE ARE at least three reasons to stay away from most of the world's
famous redeveloped waterfronts: too many people; too many architectural
cliches; too much junk food.
Cape Town's bijou harbour district must have been built for snobs like me.
The crowds are manageable - and reflect an easy racial mix seen nowhere else
in South Africa - the architecture is tastefully understated, with the
minimum of Victorian frills and fretwork; and although fast food is a bit of
a failing, the harbour's fish restaurants easily maintain the upmarket tone.
The name is implausible: the Victoria and Alfred waterfront. Surely, some
sort of post-colonial joke by the developer? But the Cape Town harbour owes
its existence to this unlikely pair: Queen Victoria's second son, Prince
Alfred, tipped the first load of stone to start construction of the harbour
breakwater in 1860. Ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope found shelter first
in the Alfred basin, and later in a second basin named after the Queen.
By 1990, the warehouses and transport sheds built to service Cape shipping
in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods had sunk into dereliction.
Trendy Capetonians made an occasional pilgrimage to the waterfront's one
seedy fish restaurant - the Harbour Cafe - but generally avoided the
dangerous and decaying port.
Since then Transnet, the state-owned transport corporation, and private
developers have invested around R400m (Pounds 81.7m) to redevelop the
waterfront area for tourism, shopping and upmarket habitation. More than 1m
people visit the V &amp; A waterfront every month, and several thousand more
work there, in restored Victorian buildings overlooking the port. The first
residents are due to move into harbour flats and townhouses by 1995.
Cape Town's natural advantages made it an obvious choice to join the world
trend to waterfront redevelopment: where Boston harbour has a freeway as
scenic backdrop, Cape Town has the granite wonder of Table Mountain. The
active fishing port contributes scent, sound, and atmosphere. Harbour cruise
boats stop at Robben Island, where tourists can visit Nelson Mandela's
former cell.
Cape Town retains many Cape Dutch and imperial Victorian buildings. Port
architecture is mainly late Victorian or Edwardian, while new structures
echo the lines of the antique buildings.
Even the Victoria Wharf shopping centre - designed as a light and airy
version of a Victorian railway station, complete with floor tiles made from
original period moulds - scores high on the scale of snob appeal.
In this land of the glitzy shopping mall Victoria Wharf provides a nice mix
of trendy women's fashion boutiques and African crafts, ethnic food stalls
and proletarian movie houses. Africans and whites mingle without the
suspicion and fear which poison inner-city shopping in Johannesburg.
The African National Congress initially condemned the project as a
playground for rich whites: but as the movement learns to throw off the
hair-shirt of liberation politics, it has begun to realise that even South
Africa needs its playgrounds - and what more delightful one than the V &amp; A
waterfront, a place of historic charm and modern opulence where South
Africans can go to escape, for at least a few hours, the birth pangs of
their new multi-racial nation.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Cookery: The cucumber's cousin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEET PEPPERS and aubergines still seem a mite too foreign to figure much on
the average British menu. Yet courgettes, which became available here at
about the same time, enjoy ready acceptance in kitchens up and down the
land. I suppose this is partly because courgettes are cousins of the
vegetable marrow, that whopping favourite of the village fete.
Courgettes are small and slender - or should be. Commercial growers
sometimes let them swell to torpedo size. The bigger the yield the bigger
the profit perhaps, but if courgettes are allowed to grow on, much of their
charm is lost: texture coarsens and flavour is dissipated. On the other hand
there is such a thing as courgettes which are too small. Imported dwarf
varieties - and even home-grown picked when tiny - strike me as tasteless.
The optimum size is about three to four inches. Here are three quick, simple
ways to cook such paragons.
COURGETTE SPLITS
The idea of plunging courgettes into boiling water is anathema to me but
steaming is excellent as it avoids waterlogging and shows off the delicacy
of the vegetable particularly well. Few recipes are simpler than this, which
is, so to speak, the vegetable equivalent of Devonshire splits - courgettes,
butter and herbs being substituted for finger-shaped buns, cream and jam.
Allow two or three courgettes per person. Wipe them clean and leave them
whole. Lay them in a roomy steamer basket and cook over fast-boiling water
for 4-5 minutes or until done to your liking. Then cut the courgettes
lengthways in half but not quite through. Pat them with a clean cloth inside
and out to blot up any moisture. Lay them in a warmed dish, sprinkle with
sea salt and insert into the splits slivers of butter and a scattering of
torn basil leaves.
Although good enough to eat as a dish in its own right with warm bread to
mop up the fragrant juices, courgettes cooked this way go especially well
with poached and grilled poultry and fish.
PANCAKED ZUCCHINI
Pancakes baked in the oven are infinitely easier on the cook than those that
are tossed, and I recommend these with wine as a pre-theatre bonne bouche or
with a salad, cheese and fruit as a late-night supper. Enough for two to
four, depending on greed.
Make a smooth batter, by hand or in a food processor, using 2 oz flour,  1/2
to  3/4 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 2 lightly beaten eggs and 4 fl oz
semi-skimmed milk. Season with coarsely ground black pepper and a sliver of
garlic crushed with salt.
Put 2 x 7 inch flan tins in the oven and heat to 450'F (230'C) gas mark 8.
When the oven and the tins are very hot, drizzle the tins with a little
olive oil and return them to the oven for a minute or so.
Quickly slice  1/2 lb small courgettes and stir them into the batter. Divide
the mixture between the sizzling hot tins, tilting the tins to cover the
bases evenly. Drizzle a little more oil over the top of each pancake and
bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 425'F (220'C) gas mark 7, and bake
for 10 minutes more, by which time the pancakes will have risen in frazzled
waves round the edges of the tins and be blotched with gold. Loosen
carefully and cut into wedges for serving hot or warm.
Note: put the tins to soak in the sink as soon as possible after cooking.
Stuck-on batter is a beast to wash up.
CHICKEN WITH COURGETTE, TOMATO AND TARRAGON
Chicken, courgette, tomato and tarragon are a lovely light summery
combination and this makes a pretty dish piled into a ring of basmati rice.
To serve 3-4 people you will need 1 lb each of courgettes and tomatoes and
3/4 lb skinned and boned chicken breast meat. Cut the courgettes into thick
matchsticks. Peel, core and seed the tomatoes and cut the flesh into strips.
(Save the tomato pulp and seed to whizz and sieve for salad dressings.) Cut
the chicken meat into quills. Pour a tablespoon or so of olive oil over the
chicken, add a good grinding of black pepper and mix well to season and to
anoint every piece.
To cook, first fry the courgettes briefly in a smidgeon of olive oil in a
large saute pan or wok. Remove and keep warm. Then stir-fry the chicken and
let it rest with the courgettes. Finally add a little more oil to the pan
and fry the tomatoes quickly till hot.
Turn off the heat but leave the pan where it is. Scatter the tomatoes with a
few blades of chopped fresh tarragon. Return the chicken and courgettes to
the pan. Toss to mix, adding extra tarragon and sea salt to taste. Pile the
aromatic mixture into a ring of rice and serve straight away.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: Sainsbury fizzes with enthusiasm - Britain's
biggest wine merchant now has a range to fit its buying power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT BEFORE time, Britain's biggest wine merchant is beginning to show signs
of the sheer enthusiasm for wine that has for several years distinguished
the best of its rivals. More than a decade ago Sainsbury led the
supermarkets' advance into wine merchant territory with a combination of
muscle and confidence that gave it the lion's share of the highly
competitive British wine market.
In recent years, however, Sainsbury's wine department may have kept
shareholders happy by keeping at least a percentage point ahead of Tesco,
its main rival for wine market share. But the famously broad selection
seemed more driven by gaps to be filled and price points to be reached than
inspired by the increasingly dazzling range of plums on offer in the world's
vineyards and cellars. Producers and agents complained that a decision which
took a month chez Safeway, and a minute at Oddbins, could take up to a year
at Sainsbury's.
The company's rivals among multiple retailers may be concerned at its
increasing insistence on exclusive rights to certain lines. Its rivals among
the independent merchants are probably less concerned about Sainsbury's
efforts to overcome the supermarket wine retailer's most serious
shortcoming: lack of expert advice. Sales assistants trained by headphones,
a two-hour audio tape and a workbook are unlikely to be much of a match for
the bevy of wine enthusiasts employed by most decent wine merchants. Nor
does Sainsbury, or any other supermarket, give the independents a run for
their money in the Pounds 5-plus per bottle range.
But the wines that follow all represent bargains from the Sainsbury buying
team, at last reflecting ingenuity as well as heavyweight bargaining (they
seem to have done their own bulk buying from Peter Bright and Hardys of
Australia). It is worth noting, however, that, with the exception of the
Copertino and Green Point, there is no point in keeping these wines; in fact
most are best drunk now, enhanced by the bloom of youth. Some are just
reaching the shelf. Spot the wine with no antipodean connection.
WHITES Chapel Hill Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 2.99. Terrible label, but great
value. Made by a New Zealander in Hungary. Of course. Much more convincing
than Chapel Hill Sauvignon.
The Country Collection Basilicata White Pounds 3.29. Unusually fruity dry
southern Italian, made by the ubiquitous Jacques Lurton of Bordeaux. (Just
Pounds 2.99 at Victoria Wine until the end of June.)
Gyongyos Country White Pounds 3.35. Now for Hugh Ryman (of Bordeaux,
Languedoc, Moldova et al) playing with Semillon grapes in Hungary. Very
lively (and the racy Gyongyos Chardonnay is probably worth the 36p
supplement over the Chapel Hill version).
Chardonnay Delle Tre Venezie Pounds 3.59. New, highly successful, part
barrel-fermented north-eastern Italian.
Sainsbury's Sauvignon Vin De Pays D'oc Pounds 3.59. Better than most
Languedoc answers to Sancerre.
Santa Sara 1992 Pounds 3.95. Oaky, slightly sweet Portuguese white from
Australian Peter Bright.
Chais Beaumiere Sauvignon 1992 Pounds 3.99. Much better than most Languedoc
answers to Sancerre, and possibly the best wine yet from the French outpost
of Hardys of Australia (although their quarter bottles of Merlot 1991
continue to shock British Airways customers with their quality).
Denbies Estate 1991 Pounds 3.99. Well-made lively dry white. Full, round and
fruity. Unapologetically English.
Viognier 1992 Pounds 4.49. Scented, pale version of Condrieu from the
Ardeche co-op.
Moondah Brook Chenin Blanc 1992. Pounds 4.99 Sainsbury's most interesting
Australian wine (as opposed to wine-maker). Oak and lime, but nothing like
after-shave.
REDS Do Campo Tinto Pounds 2.99. Good lively Portuguese red from Peter
Bright, whose Argentinian red Malbec/Cabernet and, especially, white
Torrontes at Pounds 2.99 should be the bargains of August when they arrive.
La Mancha 1992 Castillo de Alhambra Pounds 2.99. More concentrated Spanish
red than previous vintages.
Copertino Riserva 1989 Pounds 3.95. Heady southern Italian, a prime
candidate for cellaring.
Cavas de Weinert 1985 Pounds 6.99. Full, sweet, viscous and a real mouthful.
Special.
OTHERS Jeanmaire 1988 Champagne Pounds 9.95. Special offer. Silly price.
Respectable quality.
Green Point 1990 Pounds 9.95. Australian fizz from Moet &amp; Chandon; every bit
as good as the above.
Nagyrede Cabernet Sauvignon Rose 1992 Pounds 2.99. Pretty, very pale, dry
and scented.
Bouvier Trockenbeerenauslese 1989 Pounds 5.85 (half). Rich, curranty
Austrian dessert wine.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: A culinary philosophy spiced with success -
Nicholas Lander meets a French chef who believes fervently in keeping his
cooking close to his local roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I DO not serve caviar in my restaurant because I do not know any sturgeon
fishermen.' It was almost midnight and Olivier Roellinger was confidently
expounding his culinary philosophy. We were sitting in a small manoir that
had been the Roellinger family house in Cancale, Brittany, but has for 12
years served as his restaurant.
The originality of Roellinger's approach is matched by his modesty. When I
had asked to meet him I had expected Roellinger to join my table wearing a
personalised chef's jacket - after all, he is a two-star Michelin chef.
Instead, we were led away from the other diners and upstairs to a small
salon where he joined us wearing simple whites, cut Breton style, and a pair
of working men's boots.
He apologised if he appeared tired. He had been up before dawn to drive to
Rennes, 36 miles away, for its Saturday market. 'Walking around this market
is an essential and very enjoyable part of my job. Here I meet my suppliers,
the fishermen from the west of Brittany, the poultry and vegetable suppliers
from the east, who are such vital ingredients in what I cook.'
The cooking in French restaurants had, Roellinger believed, lost touch with
its local roots and the seasons. But he was confident this was changing.
Other French chefs were taking up this challenge and he cited Michel Bras at
Laguiole near Conques as a fellow traveller.
His menus read, therefore, like the results of an extensive shopping trip.
Wonderful shellfish, not just the mussels and oysters which Cancale
bountifully provides but locally-caught crab, lobster and clams. These are
used in conjunction with herbs and vegetables grown on the salt marshes
along the coast which merged into one first course of tiny steamed scallops,
served on a shell with miniscule home-grown new potatoes, morel mushrooms
and cream.
Local fishermen, whom Roellinger has come to know well, bring the main
courses: Dover sole, John Dory, skate, turbot and sea bass. Most
conveniently, the marshes that stretch from Cancale to Mont St Michel
provide the area's best-known speciality, the pre-sale lamb, which has
developed a distinctive flavour from its seaside grazing.
Yet this was just the obvious aspect of Roellinger's cooking because, as we
talked, it transpired that he had never had any intention of becoming a
chef. He had graduated as a chemist (his wife, who runs the front of house
with a young, enthusiastic team, is a qualified pharmacist) when, in 1980,
he had started to cook. Eighteen months later in April 1982 they converted
the living room into a restaurant.
Roellinger's imagination was fired by the history of St Malo, the nearby
port. He says: 'My cooking is neither French nor Breton but that of St
Malo.' Two hundred years ago St Malo was the wealthiest port in France,
buoyed by the success of the Compagnie des Indes (the equivalent of the
British East India Company) in sending ships out to the Indian Ocean,
Indonesia and Persia and bringing them back laden with the spices - pepper,
ginger, cinammon and cloves - that were all the rage at the court of Louis
XIV.
Unusually for a Frenchman, Roellinger uses these spices as an integral part
of his cuisine, partly in homage to his region's past and partly to forge
new tastes and flavours. He buys them directly, closing the restaurant from
mid-December to March to be able to travel to expand his knowledge (and also
his range of rums of which there are 14 by the glass including a 1929 from
Martinique at FFr350, Pounds 42, a measure).
His own taste and the fact that he makes up each batch of spices weekly
prevents this flavouring from being too heavy or too hot. As a first course,
local lobster is transformed by a sauce using small amounts of ginger,
galangal, allspice berries, mace, nutmeg, tamarind paste and coriander,
while to the local lamb Roellinger adds a teaspoon of green cardamom, cumin,
coriander, sesame and nigella. As one of the desserts, possibly the weakest
arm of his repertoire, Roellinger produced a pain d'epices with his version
of an apple crumble. But the overall effect is stunning, food that is
appetising and full of flavour, and a menu that makes choice difficult.
Close to the restaurant the Roellingers have a small house, Les Rimains,
with six rooms overlooking the sea. Last September they converted an
extraordinary seaside mansion, built in 1925 and overlooking the bay of Mont
St Michel, into an hotel, La Maison Richeux, where the bedrooms are given
the names of spices rather than numbers and there is a simpler, less
expensive dining room, Le Coquillage.
There is also a free taxi service provided to and from the restaurant - in a
32-year-old London taxi with right hand drive and a wooden fascia.
Maison de Bricourt, 35260 Cancale, France. Tel 99 89 64 76, fax 99 89 88 47.
Dinner from FFr500, rooms FFr1,100.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: Off the rails on an Andean adventure - Abbie
Wightwick travels - eventfully - across Ecuador from Alausi to Guayaquil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'CIGARETTES, bread, fruit,' screamed the street tout. He was doing good
business and hoping his wares would not run out before the train reached its
destination. This was quite likely. We had been derailed twice, set off two
hours late and been delayed for eight hours en route.
Not bad for a scheduled eight-hour journey, but no one travelling on
Ecuador's trans-Andean railroad can complain they did not get their money's
worth in entertainment and scenery. The ride from the Andean town of Alausi
to the Pacific lowlands of Guayaquil is best taken armed with a sense of
humour and no expectation of reaching your destination on time.
Much of the track has been out of service since flooding in 1982. The full
journey from the capital, Quito, to the coast features a descent from 3,238
metres to almost sea level in just 80km. But until repairs are completed
this summer, travellers start part-way down at the Indian town of Alausi. We
arrived at Alausi 30 minutes before the 9 am departure to find a queue
stretching out of the wooden station. Backpackers jostled with locals
swinging sacks of live chickens while a party of well-dressed North
Americans on a pre-paid tour kept their distance.
The carriages, a line of converted cattle trucks with unglazed holes for
windows, stood waiting. An executive coach with reclining upholstered seats
looked more comfortable, but that was reserved for the North Americans. The
best alternative seemed the roof. Ecuadorians prefer it for good reasons:
you are guaranteed a seat, get beautiful views and in the event of
de-railing you can always jump.
10am came and went, as did 11am. At 11.30am the train finally shuddered into
action. As soon as we left the town we found ourselves travelling high on
the wall of a deep valley, flanked by forests. Below, huge rivers, dwarfed
by distance, appeared to trickle to the hot lands ahead.
The driver, keen to make up lost time, was enjoying the power of his new
diesel engine, which had replaced steam a few weeks earlier. Unfortunately,
the concrete sleepers being brought in as part of a renovation programme had
not yet been installed. The existing sleepers - wooden, and rotten - were
unable to cope with the weight of the diesel and within 10 minutes there was
a massive jolt as the front carriage derailed.
'It's not unusual,' said a vendor, leaping down to join passengers shouting
advice to the train crew. Fortunately, staff carry a kit of crow bars,
wedges of track and chains, and within 10 minutes the train was back on the
rails. But it took the best part of an hour before the track was in anything
approaching working order.
As we set off, the scenery became more spectacular and within half-an-hour
we were approaching the high spot of the journey, the Devil's Nose, a
perpendicular wall of rock more than 300m high. The track down the Devil's
Nose, heralded as a 'miracle of engineering' when it was completed in 1902,
allows the train to descend by advancing and reversing along a zig-zag of
hair-raising switchbacks.
But as we rattled along the cliff ledge, peering nervously over the edge, we
heard a loud bang behind us. A jolt sent chickens and backpacks flying as
the luxury tourist coach glanced off rocks and derailed just before a
corner.
No one was hurt, but a long delay was inevitable. White-faced passengers
emerged toting cameras to record their near miss. 'Well, I told you it would
be an adventure, Bob,' a lady from Iowa told her husband. A handful of
frightened passengers opted to walk back to Alausi, while the on-board chain
gang got their equipment out again.
The journey down the cliff face was spectacular, if uneventful compared with
the adventures of the morning. When we reached the bottom it was as though
we had crossed a divide between the two geographies and personalities of
Ecuador. When we left Alausi we were in the bleak world of poncho-wearing,
Quechua-speaking Indians which moves to the rhythms of the pan pipes.
At the base of the Devil's Nose we saw the first signs of the other Ecuador.
The vegetation was denser and greener, the weather hotter and more humid.
The people are different, too. The coastal plains, dominated by banana
plantations and rice paddies, are inhabited by more open and relaxed
salsa-loving blacks and mestizos.
At the first big town, a ramshackle collection of tin-roofed houses called
Bucay, many of the passengers had had enough. We were not likely to reach
Guayaquil until midnight and buses were waiting to ferry out the
disenchanted. We opted to stay on the roof, soaking up the atmosphere of the
lowland outback until the train pulled into Milagro.
Milagro is a large town of 170,000 people, but lacks properly-paved roads.
The puddles in the pot-holes make an ideal breeding ground for malarial
mosquitos which plague the coast, and even the best of the hotels are damp
and dreary.
Milagro means miracle, but on that that wet night the only miracle that
sprung to mind was that anyone wanted to live there. It was two days until
the next train pulled into town, and the journey would have taken four
hours, so we abandoned it in favour of the hour-long bus ride.
With French and Spanish backing, the head of the Ecuadorian rail company
promised me that things were going to get better. Modern sleepers would put
an end to derailments and new locomotives will allow them to travel faster.
New carriages are on order, too - meaning an end of the cattle trucks.
But the passengers in these cattle trucks are mainly Indians travelling to
the coast for whom the main attraction of the train is the fare - at 20p, a
fraction of the cost of the bus. For the tourist, there is only one place to
be, the roof. Up there, no amount of money is going to improve the feeling
of the wind in your hair, the sun in your face and panoramic views all
round.
Abbie Wightwick travelled independently to Quito and then took a bus via
Riobamba to Alausi. The larger touring companies in Quito, such as
Metropolitan Touring on Av Amazonas, organise all-in tours, including bus to
Alausi, returning to Quito from towns at the bottom of the Devil's Nose.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: The train now arriving 15 years late . . .

<TEXT>
THE RECEPTION as we drew into Maputo station in Mozambique would have done
any royal family proud. A crowd of 200 broke into applause and champagne
corks popped. The British ambassador was present - a caricature in colonial
diplomatic attire - with his South African counterpart in stiff attendance,
too, not to mention the entire Maputo press corp.
The previous half-an-hour had been even more celebratory. As the train
pulled through the suburbs on the outskirts of the city, the track had been
lined with thousands of cheering well-wishers, a mix of curious adults and
children running alongside the train. For the few passengers on board,
conspicuously white and privileged compared with the onlookers, it felt a
little like Louis XVI surveying his subjects.
The occasion was the arrival in Maputo of the first passenger train from
South Africa in 15 years. It was no ordinary train, either. The Pride of
Africa is an ultra-luxurious private steam train whose carriages and engines
have been lovingly rehabilitated over the years by a bold entrepreneur,
Rohan Vos. Previously, Rovos Rail, named after its owner, had only run as
far as Hazyview in the Eastern Transvaal (it also travels to Cape Town)
where guests disembarked to visit some of the country's premier wildlife
lodges. Now Vos is determined to take his train through to Maputo on a
regular basis.
We were the first passengers to do the Maputo leg. In fact only eight of us,
and the crew, completed the final, historic 88km from the Eastern Transvaal
border town of Komatipoort to Maputo, as most passengers stopped off at the
game lodges. Only later did Vos admit that, given some residual nervousness
about the safety of the route, he had not been too unhappy about the slim
passenger complement.
His apprehension was understandable. Although most Mozambiquens are
confident that peace has returned to the country following the ceasefire
agreed last October between the Frelimo government and the rebel Renamo
movement, the ravages of the war they fought are only too evident.
Indeed, the three-hour trip from the Nkomati River is a grim testimony to
the ravages of war. All the railway sidings en route are shot-up and
abandoned. Burnt-out carriages lie abandoned next to the track.
However, such gloomy images should not obscure the attractions of Maputo as
a travel destination. Although very run down, there remains a romance, an
air of continental sophistication, not found elsewhere in southern Africa.
The languid people, the Portuguese language, local delicacies such as prawns
and cashew nuts, the relatively unspoilt coastal strip - all combine to lend
Maputo an exotic charm completely absent from Durban, the coastal resort not
far to the south, whose beach-front Golden Mile is a monument to commercial
vulgarity.
At the heart of Maputo is the Polana Hotel, a jewel of a hotel restored to
its pre-colonial splendour and the weekend destination for Rovos visitors
who can spend a day looking around Maputo and take a day trip to the island
of Inhaca.
With a capacity of 46 passengers and a service staff of about a dozen,
travelling by Rovos Rail is luxurious. The rooms, by train standards, are
enormous: 14 to 16 square metres, with beautiful en suite bathrooms. The
food is excellent, with imaginative menus and a good wine list.
Guests are requested to 'dress for dinner', which lends a fine sense of
occasion to meals in the wooden dining car. Service is friendly and
efficient but unobtrusive, while the observation car at the back of the
train offers a fine place to meet fellow passengers and appreciate the
passing show.
Perhaps the train's distinguishing feature is that it is steam-driven. (For
reasons of speed and cost, electric engines are used for some of the
night-time stretches). While the chugging steam locomotive adds immeasurably
to the romance of train travel, it is a serious matter for lovers of steam,
some of whom follow the train.
One such devotee was Dave, a salaries and wages clerk from Witbank, who
lovingly tracked the train's progress across the Eastern Transvaal in his
old brown Peugeot 504. He gave up the chase at nightfall, but when dawn
broke the next day, there was the Peugeot again, watching us from the far
side of the Crocodile River as the train crept eastwards out of Nelspruit.
Dave's persistence was rewarded when he was taken on board for the Maputo
leg of the trip, where he was able to brief the press with due gravity about
the full glories of the Pride of Africa.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: Watch out for brigands, goats and hunters -
Calabrians don't ask where the train stops; they ask where it 'dies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER

<TEXT>
IN THE innocent days of Italian TV it was always good for a laugh. 'He met a
terrible death in Calabria, brigands tied him to the railway track.'
'He was run over?' 'No, he died of starvation waiting for the train to
arrive.'
Descending on Cosenza at a crawl, the passengers grow anxious. 'Can't you go
any faster? There's a girl here going into labour.' The driver says pregnant
women should have more sense than to board this train. 'When I boarded it,'
the girl whimpers, 'I wasn't pregnant.'
It is recorded that the FCL (Ferrovia Calabro-Lucane) company directors'
first act on being incorporated was to invest in enough uniforms, epaulettes
and swords to last 200 years.
That was 80 years ago, shortly after a solid-tyred Ansaldo motor-wagonette
had first woken the Calabrian highlands from their long sleep with the
splutter of its petrol engine. The FCL soon drove it off the road. The
railway, furnished with rack-and-pinion arrangements for the steep sections,
poked and probed at the massifs from both sides of the peninsula. The
company performed miracles of civil engineering in this land where mountains
rise to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft)within a mile or two of the coast and torrent
valleys fall in gradients of one-in-10.
The Calabro-Lucane system never became a network. It remains to this day a
group of disconnected routes (excluded from State Railways' timetables) on
which short trains of diesel-electric railcars twist and turn through
gorges, cross high slim viaducts and burrow under geological monstrosities
to achieve high altitudes . . .tand expire. Calabrians don't ask where the
train stops; they ask where it 'dies.'
Wayside stations bear the names of far-distant villages. Travel writer
Norman Douglas in Old Calabria found a hamlet 33km (20 miles) from its
station. We located one more distant than that. We left the train at the
halt called Roccabernarda. The mountains were piled around us and so was our
luggage. Where was the transport into town? The station simpleton indicated
his wooden clogs.
How far, then, on foot? He showed us the signpost. It pointed up the sort of
track which makes mountain goats' hairs stand on end and it said:
'Roccabernarda 43km.'
In Cosenza, a provincial capital, the houses of the Old Town scramble up the
hill like frightened sheep. At their feet the red-and-brown coaches of the
train to Catanzaro emerge from the station, cross the dry bed of the Busento
(beneath which the grave of Alaric the Goth still awaits discovery), and
start stitching their way across the face of the mountain en route for the
Sila forests.
Long ago this was the train which 'never left Cosenza and never arrived at
Catanzaro' - but now it does the journey every day. It is running the FCL's
flagship route of more than 100km, in the course of which it will penetrate
90 tunnels and soar over 76 viaducts. Scale the whole thing down to the
dimensions of a model railway and you would admire its creator's imaginative
fancy, never dreaming it could be a real-life system. The railcars have
speeded up the timetable but the trip still takes about six hours.
Eventually, during ther journey, I went to sit beside the driver. His sign
said 'Do not Talk to the Driver,' but he talked all the time, mostly about
dreadful accidents when brakes failed and packed railcars jumped the rails
and fell into ravines. From his vivid accounts you might have supposed these
events occurred last Friday. I established that they had happened once, in
the year he was born.
A frail old lady carrying a crown of rosemary to the Easter procession at
Tiriolo weighed in with tales of Calabrian brigands, the last of whom
surrendered on Aspromonte in 1928. Her dialect was impenetrable and I picked
up perhaps one word in five, but I gathered that the brigands were a bunch
of Merry Men, well-disposed to the peasantry and given to paying with gold
coins for small favours.
She was moving on to horror stories of wolves when we arrived at Bianchi,
the principal intermediate station. Bianchi, a prosperous little settlement
on the watershed, is named for the local boy who, on Mussolini's behalf, led
the March on Rome. Here is the coincidenza, where the single track briefly
becomes double and northbound and southbound trains cross.
From Bianchi it is all downhill. You career through gorges, your driver
steering with his finger-tips. You need sharp eyes for the scenery: gorgeous
ribbons of fruit blossom, bougainvillea bursting out over stone sheds and
roofs of broken marsiglia pantiles. Crossing the Corace you glimpse a
baroque church, islanded in the middle of that destructive torrent - an
earthquake changed the course of the river but spared the house of God.
You brake hard for lonely outposts where huntsmen come on board, festooned
in bandoliers, dragging spaniels which look none too happy about the events
of the day, the first of quail shooting.
At Sorbo-Fossato a dainty parish priest in white lace with a silver rod
sprinkles holy water on the train from a basin held by his crippled acolyte.
Somewhere else boxes of gladioli are loaded. 'The earliest in Europe,' says
the driver. 'Calabria first, San Remo second.'
At Catanzaro the train empties. I watch driver and conductor engaging the
cogs and I jump aboard again for the slow drop through a 300m cliff to the
valley floor. You have to hang on to something, otherwise you find yourself
hurdling over the seats in front.
After the tunnel there is one more stop to allow the conductor to rob an
orchard. He returns with pockets stuffed full of lemons the size of young
grapefruit. 'Calabria is the garden of Furope,' he tells me. 'The finest
soil, the cleanest air, the purest water. With such riches around us,why do
we remain poor?'
Now it is dark. The terminus, a large hut in a field on the sea's edge, is
lampless and lifeless. Tired of waiting for the train, the one-man station
staff has gone home. It needs all available hands to uncouple the leading
car and spin it on the turntable. We re-couple, making the last coach the
first coach, transforming today's point of arrival into tomorrow's point of
departure.
Throughout their history the Ferrovia Calabro-Lucane lines have been under
threat of closure or amalgamation with the State system.
Those which survive in Calabria are: Cosenza-Catanzaro Lido, 113km;
Cosenza-San Giovanni in Fiore, 69km; Soverato-Chiaravalle Centrale, 23km;
Gioia Tauro-Cinquefrondi, 32km; Gioia Tauro-Sinopoli, 27km.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: Great world rail routes - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are evil plans afoot for the world's railways. In Britain, some
companies hoping to buy rail franchises after privatisation are already
hatching schemes to concrete over the tracks and run buses instead of
trains.
The 'guided busways', which allow specially-built vehicles to thunder at
high speeds without being steered, are intended to combine the flexibility
of buses with the speed and safety of rail. Such systems already exist in
Essen and Adelaide.
Rail enthusiasts will shudder. For these poor, old-fashioned souls, the
concept of a railway is limited to tracks and trains. To indulge them - and
other simpletons of like mind - here is a smattering of what the world still
has to offer:
Mexico - Copper Canyon Railway: Chihuahua is a city in the north of Mexico
which has, as its claim to fame, a hairless dog. Los Mochis is a dull town
on the Pacific. Between the two lies one of the world's most spectacular
journeys. The route, which took six decades to construct, climbs to the
peaks of the Sierra Madre before freewheeling to the Pacific. In between are
73 tunnels, 28 bridges and heart-stopping moments where passengers are
dangled over some of the world's deepest canyons. The train leaves Chihuahua
at 8.30am daily, arriving in Los Mochis at 8.30pm. Mexican Tourist Board,
London. Tel: 071-734-1058.
Japan - The Bullet Train: Japan's ultra-modern bullet trains explode through
the ancient interior. To cut down on price (trains are not cheap), invest in
a Japan Rail Pass - availble only outside Japan - for Pounds 172 which
entitles you to seven days' unlimited travel. Japan Travel Bureau
(071-836-9367). Recommended routes include The Twilight Express from Osaka
to Sapporo, or between Koriyama and Niigata through the scenic Tohoku
region. Japan National Tourist Organisation (071-734-9638).
Former Soviet Union - Bolshoi Express: Tsar Nicholas I mistrusted technical
innovation and only grudgingly agreed to the construction of Russia's first
rail track between St Petersburg and his summer palace, 26 miles away.
Since, rail has been vigorously embraced and the Commonwealth of Independent
States now has the world's largest network. An extravagant way to explore it
is by the Bolshoi Express, a train built for government officials in the
1950s and restored in 1990. Cox &amp; Kings (071-834-7472) uses steam
locomotives for parts of the journey. The Tashkent to St Petersburg train
puffs its way through Samarkand, Bukhara, Astrakhan, Volgograd and Moscow.
The price: Pounds 2,495 for 14 days.
North America - Amtrak: Most Americans travel by car and airplane, which is
why railway stations are often as hushed as libraries. Yet rail is one of
the best ways of seeing the countryside. Amtrak's Empire Builder, which
takes 52 hours to trundle from Chicago to Seattle, passes through the
pancake-flat Mid-West before reaching Glacier National Park and the Cascade
Mountains. The one-way trip costs Pounds 215 (with a Pounds 100 supplement
for bed and meals). Non-US citizens should consider the 15-day Amtrak pass,
priced Pounds 135-Pounds 200. Amtrak(071-978-5212).
India - rail pass: Tomes have been written about India's railways, and all
of it is true. The Indrail pass, which allows a week's unlimited travel for
Pounds 77, is hard to beat. First stop should be the London office of Dr
Swaminath Dandipani, S D Enterprises (081-903-3411), who claims to have
memorised the network's entire timetable and is the UK agent for Indrail.
Britain - The Royal Scotsman: The Royal Scotsman, Abercrombie &amp; Kent
(071-730-9600), makes unhurried, luxurious progress through the Scottish
Highlands and between London and Edinburgh. Its Pullman carriages are
remodelled in Edwardian style. The four-day Northern and Eastern Tour, which
follows the Strathspey line, incorporates the Highland Wildlife Park, Kyle
of Lochalsh, Isle of Skye and Glamis castle. It costs a mean Pounds 2,120.
Or you could charter the entire train - Pounds 44,900 for three days.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Fashion: A totally tasteful Ascot? - never / After a day's
serious frock-watching artist Margaret Keedy and Lucia van der Post found
time for fun and frivolity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT thing about Ascot-dress is never, ever to confuse it with fashion.
Ascot, like most of the summer events which collectively make-up the season,
could be declared a fashion-free zone. It is one unto itself. But, to the
dedicated frock-observer and serious follower of the season, it offers some
interesting pointers to the habits and mores of that mysterious breed - the
ladies-who-lunch.
One thing is clear - if an invitation to one of the set-piece events of the
season comes your way do not, if you want to feel you belong, bring out your
Issey Miyake, your Romeo Gigli, your directional Martin Margiela or Ann
Demeulemeester.
Keep them for wearing to a lecture at the Design Museum, to a smart lunch
with your girl-friends or to any event where the Voguettes gather (after
all, they would know that those seams on the outside and the fraying edges
are absolutely the dernier cri and would not for a minute think that you had
put your clothes on inside out).
What you need are the sort of soft, pretty clothes that have nothing to do
with being at the cutting-edge of fashion but everything to do with
flattery. The new long, softer look, based as it is on floaty, sensual
fabrics and more delicate lines is perfect for going to the races, to
Henley, to summer operas, to weddings and garden parties.
As for trousers, fashion editors this year have got fearfully excited at
uncovering a hither-to forgotten rule which deems that at Ascot women may
after all wear trousers provided the jacket and trousers are made from
matching fabrics.
The other happy thought is that (almost) anything goes. A glance at Margaret
Keedy's sketches of some of the outfits on display last Tuesday will
reassure all those who have ever felt timid about what to wear. Take comfort
from the thought that no matter what you wear there will always be somebody
better dressed and others who are worse dressed.
Ascot is not the time or the place for an excess of sobriety. It is a time
for fun and frivolity, for laughter and chat. For objective observers of the
passing scene much of the fun lies in the variety. A totally tasteful Ascot
does not bear thinking about.
After a day's serious frock-watching I came, for what it is worth, to a few
gentle conclusions. Gentlemen, I decided, should resist the temptation to
brighten up their grey morning coats with dotty waistcoats or daft ties.
They should resist even more strenuously any suggestion that their
waistcoats should match her dress. And if you think that goes without
saying, then you did not see what I saw at Ascot this week.
Women should resist too many ruffles and frills and especially frilled
peplums outside straight skirts. Too many cut-away straps and too much flesh
is not really very pretty away from a beach or pool.
Unless you are one of those enviable beings who does not get out of bed for
less than Pounds 10,000 then I think it unwise to wear a masculine top-coat
over a very short mini-skirt and very high heels - and even if you are one
of those enviable beings you would probably look better in something else.
White shoes are the Queen Mother's special terrain and only the very young
or the very beautiful can get away with severe little bowlers.
Herbaceous borders really look their best in gardens, a thought that might
be particularly addressed by larger ladies. The prevalent tendency to wear a
printed silk dress and pick out one colour (usually the most obvious) in
which to have a straw hat made, came to seem a little predictable.
There are, of course, several favourite looks on offer. There is Eurochic
(snappy little suits with above-the-knee skirts, eye-catching straw hats and
lots of gold jewellery) and English Rose (pale, long strings of beads,
echoes of 1920s, an addiction to floribunda, whether on frock, shawl or hat
and just occasionally on all three).
Then there is the Dress-to-be-photographed look - forget charm, prettiness
and elegance, here what really counts is nerve. Dotty hats, bare midriffs,
lots of decolletage, acres of leg (no matter what their length or shape) are
what seems to get the lenses pointing. Officials at Ascot retain this
charming old-fashioned notion that the punters do not wished to be disturbed
by vulgar photographers and so keep them herded on a balcony. If you stand
on the balcony you do not come away with the same impression. Up and down
the Dress-to-be-photographed set go - first one way and then the next. Wait
15 minutes and here they come again.
Or you could, if you you could carry it off, aim for what you might call
Glamourpuss-style - short, tight dress (forget lunch), high-heels,
eye-catching hat, loads of make-up.
Of Recession Chic I saw not a sign, though there was a bit of tutting in the
press room from the pundits who, from time to time recognised . . . oh, the
shame of it . . . last year's dress.
My own favourite looks veered towards the under-stated, the quiet monochrome
colour-schemes. There was the older woman I saw in a simple but
beautifully-cut soft pink coat-dress with pearls and a soft black straw hat:
the cream suit, (It's cooler in the shade) with the soft flared trousers and
the beautiful straw hat; the quiet long cream skirt and jacket (Cream of the
Crop); the floaty navy and cream skirt worn with a long, soft cream top.
Longer lines definitely looked newer and prettier. All these managed to
carry off that difficult double of being both elegant and pretty.
The nicest hats were the big soft straws. The chicest heads had the hair
tucked away from the face. Hard little boaters on top of flowing tresses are
not becoming. I belong to the school of thought that concurs with hatter
David Shilling's dictum about hats: 'The sole purpose of a hat is to make
you look more beautiful. If it does not, do not wear it.'
Some people, of course, come to watch the horses. You can tell who they are
because they carry binoculars and have a purposeful air heading for areas
into which the dress-to-be-seen set never venture. Above all, you can tell
who they are because they do not loiter endlessly in front of the
photographers' stand.

FT  19 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: An ace invention for tennis elbow - Lucia
van der Post swings her racket and heads into the garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS open season for tennis elbow again. With the tennis bonanza of
Wimbledon upon us and the parks already beginning to fill with fair-weather
players, it is time to look to your racket. If tennis elbow is your problem
then Dunlop has developed new technology to deal with it. Since powerful
modern rackets cause greater vibration than the simpler, older rackets (said
to be the major cause of tennis elbow) Dunlop reasoned that if it could
break the circuit and stop vibration reaching the arm, then the elbow should
be better protected.
A racket incorporating what Dunlop describes as its 'Impact Shock Isolation
System' (ISIS) Technology was launched last year. Essentially, it involved
separating the handle from the racket shaft just below the top of the grip
and then rejoining and reinforcing it with carbon rods encased in a
shock-absorbing elastomer which prevents vibration travelling down the
shaft.
In spite of the price - Pounds 199.99 - the tennis world, particularly in
America, went wild about it. Tennis nuts kept off the court by physical
ailments will go to almost any lengths to get back on again, it seems. There
are now four rackets in the ISIS range (each code-named Revelation) ranging
in price from Pounds 99.99 to Pounds 199.99.
If you are dissatisfied with your local garden centre, if you cannot find
the steamer chair, the bamboo rake, the wrought-iron weather vane of your
dreams, Reid &amp; Waterers will deliver it to your door. The company's summer
catalogue does not claim to be comprehensive - you will not find here the
reams of sheds and plastic coverings, the pesticides and seedlings that are
the stuff of most gardening catalogues. What you will find is an edited
selection of things either useful or decorative.
There is a choice of just three different barbecues, a small selection of
some good garden furniture, sturdily made spades and gardening knives, forks
and edging tools (particularly nice, being British-made with solid ash
shafts). There are oval metal planters, glass lamps for using when eating
out of doors (Pounds 29.50), verdigris candlesticks (Pounds 12.95),
Victorian jardinieres (Pounds 29.50 and Pounds 39.50), and some ineffably
plain painted trays (Pounds 34.50). There are garden torches and Versailles
planters, a particularly elegant bottle carrier (Le Baladeur, Pounds 24.95)
and beeswax candles.
Many of the products would make splendid presents - the gardener's holdall,
for instance, which is a tough canvas bag with eight separate pockets in
which tools can be stored, for Pounds 29.95. The catalogue, in short, offers
almost everything the keen gardener or conservatory owner might hanker for -
apart that is from the serious horticultural products. For a free catalogue
telephone 081-572 3225. To order telephone 0345-626268. You pay only local
call prices and the lines are open seven days a week.

FT  19 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: Bold and bright in the 1990s - Alice
Rawsthorn considers the decade's emerging, technology-conscious furniture
designers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS the British furniture scene has been dominated by the same trio of
designers - Ron Arad, Jasper Morrison and Tom Dixon - who made their names
in London in the 1980s and who have gone on to establish themselves in the
international market.
It has taken time for a new wave of young designers to emerge in the early
1990s. A recession is not, after all, the best time for fresh ideas to
flourish. But just as fashion is changing with the arrival of names such as
Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, the next generation of furniture
designers is begining to break through and to develop a different style for
the 1990s.
The key themes in the new furniture are bold shapes, bright colours and
modern materials. Whereas fashion has gone off on a 1970s nostalgia trip,
today's young furniture designers are more interested in the industrial
ideals of the 1920s modernists and the space-age styles created by the
French and Italian futurists in the 1950s and 1960s.
Industrial production is another important theme. This is partly a backlash
against the artisanal work of the 1980s, when the chairs made by Ron Arad
and Tom Dixon looked more like one-off works of art than things to sit on,
and partly a reflection of the academic revival of the ideas of the early
modernists, Le Corbusier and Jean Prouve, who saw industrialisation as a
positive force in everyday life.
But the 1990s designers are also genuinely enthusiastic about the potential
of today's new technologies. They are the first generation of designers to
have been educated at a time when computer studies were compulsory in
schools and computer-aided design systems are a standard fixture in their
studios.
'I find technology incredibly exciting,' says Nick Dine, 28, whose chairs
and chaises longues are sold at Fiell on London's Kings Road. 'And I think
it is part of my responsibility as a designer to apply it to my work.'
The hitch is that it is much more expensive to produce furniture on an
industrial basis than to make it by hand. The cost of fitting out a factory
to make a new design is so high that few manufacturers are able, or willing,
to make the necessary investment, particularly in Britain, where the
furniture industry is still shell-shocked by recession.
One reason why Ron Arad and Tom Dixon taught themselves welding and
sculpture techniques in the 1980s was because they had to.
'When I started out furniture manufacturers were not exactly falling over
themselves to help obscure, young designers,' says Arad. 'If I hadn't made
my furniture myself it wouldn't have been made at all.'
Arad and Dixon established their reputations with hand-made pieces and are
now able to clinch manufacturing deals with the big German and Italian
furniture firms. The new designers are adopting a different approach. Rather
than abandon all hope of producing their work industrially, they adapt their
designs so that they are suitable for 'batch production' in small quantities
by tiny workshops.
Jack Woolley, 30, scouts about for metal workers and professional welders to
make the components for his furniture. 'It's still difficult to find small
factories that are willing to work in small batches,' he says. 'But it's not
impossible. You just have to work at it.'
The main disadvantage of batch production is the cost. Nick Dine's chaises
longues cost Pounds 1,400 each and Jack Woolley's Stretch chairs are Pounds
400. Both say they could sell their work more cheaply if they manufactured
in larger quantities.
But manufacturing in small batches does have the advantage of flexibility.
Allison Thomas, 28, can customise her Tutti Frutti stool for different
clients. She lengthened the legs to turn it into a bar stool for one,
chopped them off to make a pouffe for another and has even added a touch of
1940s glamor by embroidering the covers.
'It's fun being able to adapt my designs,' she says. 'But batch production
is really a compromise. What I want is to manufacture on a proper industrial
basis. It's only then that I'll get the clarity of shape I'm aiming for.'
The work of Nick Dine, Jack Woolley and Allison Thomas is on show at In The
Swim, an exhibition of new British design, now on at DesignLabor,
Bremerhaven in Germany, which runs until June 30 and moves to London later
this year.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Can rebates be capital?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS AN income tax rebate classed as capital?
I am entitled to a life interest under my late husband's will and the
capital is for the children on my death. My late husband died in August
1991. In June 1992 the Inland Revenue returned Pounds 937.90. My solicitor
has kept this and maintains it is capital.
You are entitled to the income which arose from your husband's assets after
his death (and to the benefit of the tax credits etc. carried by that
income), but the tax refund in June 1992 presumably related to income which
arose during his lifetime. That being so, it does indeed form part of the
capital of the trust established by his will, so what the solicitor did is

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Benificiaries as
executors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I are contemplating new wills to replace those we made 12 years
ago. On the last occasion we had but recently returned to a town where we
had lived for many years so when the solicitor asked about my executors, we
said that we had no one in mind. He asked us, therefore, about nominating
members of his staff, something to which we then agreed, not realising the
hourly rates that would be levied for this service.
Is it now possible to appoint a beneficiary under the will as executor or
executrix? Would only one executor or executrix suffice, or must there be
more than one? What is the exact responsibility of such a nominee? Is it to
ensure that the wishes of the deceased as set out in the will are in fact
faithfully carried out and to see that the solicitor secures probate as
quickly as possible, thus ensuring that the bequests are made with a minimum
of delay?
I see no problem in your appointing a beneficiary in your will as an
executor or executrix. One executor would suffice but I suggest that you
have two, in case one dies prematurely.
The executor's duties would include obtaining probate at the earliest
opportunity and ensuring that the estate is devolved in accordance with your
wishes. It is normal to have a professional as an executor or executrix so
that he or she can advise on the legal formalities. However, there is
nothing wrong with your appointing non-professionals who can then seek
professional advice where appropriate.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Reclaiming an unfair tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1991 Customs and Excise decided that a number of nursing agencies
operated as 'principals' rather than 'agents' and were therefore liable for
VAT on the whole of the bills paid by their clients for home care assistants
(though not for registered nurses) instead of only on the commission element
as previously. This extraordinary ruling has been overturned on appeal. But
meanwhile many invalids and disabled people have paid out VAT which should
not have been charged, in some cases to the tune of several thousand pounds.
Please could you indicate how they should set about getting a refund from
Customs and excise?
Any refund which is due should be sought from the nursing agencies who have
submitted bills to their clients. If the agencies have overpaid VAT they
will reclaim it from the Customs and Excise. The rights of clients to
reclaim may depend on the form of bills rendered to them. If the bills
showed VAT as a separate item and it is found that the VAT was not properly
chargeable, the amount shown as VAT should be returned. If the bills did not
show VAT separately the clients may well have no legal right to a refund. In
such cases they should ask the nursing agency if they would be willing to
make a refund.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Small steps into export markets -
Stephen Halliday explains how everyone can afford vital market research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL enterprises throughout the EC are less well prepared for the single
market than their larger brethren. A survey in Germany indicates that even
in Europe's biggest exporting nation, small to medium sized enterprises are
less well prepared than larger companies.
In the last four years there have been many schemes in the UK designed to
increase awareness of the implications of the single market. The DTI's
'Business Initiative' campaign has been the most heavily promoted but there
have been many others inspired by trade associations, chambers of commerce,
small companies groups and some of the Training and Enterprise Councils.
The proliferation of such schemes may be a problem in itself. There is
evidence that businesses are confused by the multiplicity of information
sources available. Even large companies have difficulty finding their way
through the maze of information sources, so it is scarcely surprising that
smaller organisations prefer to stay at home and shun export trade missions,
letters of credit, currency hedging and joint ventures.
The situation is easier for small businesses in France where Chambers of
Commerce, with their roots in local communities, are responsible for much of
the activity which in Britain is spread across many different agencies. In
France all but the smallest traders are obliged to belong the Chamber of
Commerce to which they must pay a levy. The Chambers run business schools,
conduct market research, organise conferences, act as lobbyists for industry
and promote exports. A chamber will, typically, have responsibility for a
certain industry and a certain part of the world. Thus, 22 of them
specialise in the UK market. The decision of the DTI to fund six 'one-stop
shops' for advice is an attempt to overcome the problems caused by the
proliferation of advice centres.
Any small company which is considering breaking into an export market is
well advised to engage experienced consultants to carry out the preparatory
work. This will include assessing the market potential, discovering
regulatory or technical requirements of the proposed market and evaluating
possible distributors, agents or partners in a joint venture. Many small
firms are put off by the costs associated with such consultants, although
the DTI will, in many cases, pay half the cost of such research when it is
undertaken by firms with fewer than 200 employees.
The cost can be further reduced by employing some highly professional, low
cost market research enterprises which are run in conjunction with
university courses. The oldest of these is Scanmark at Buckinghamshire
Business School, a college of Brunel University, which has been undertaking
export market research for 20 years. It was conceived as a method of
sharpening the marketing and linguistic skills of students on a
post-graduate course in export marketing.
Past projects have included a survey of molecular biology techniques in
three European Countries; an appraisal of the European market for artificial
sweeteners and the identification of suitable joint venture partners for a
small company distributing pharmaceuticals in Europe. Fees have ranged from
less than Pounds 200 to Pounds 20,000 - the latter for a study of the
European market for artists' materials. They so low because the fees cover
travelling and living. Students with government grants would jeopardise
their status if they worked for profit.
One disappointing feature of the operation is the reluctance of smaller
companies to undertake market research. Most Scanmark customers are large
companies such as Pepsi-Cola, Gillette and Chubb. There seems to be a deeply
held belief among small businesses that market research is something only
large companies can do, especially if it involves talking to foreigners. It
can be difficult to convey that big companies grew big by undertaking
research into market opportunities.
Good market research is within the reach of any business that is serious
about exporting because of The DTI's Export Marketing Research scheme. There
are two other options. One is to go ahead without doing the research which
will probably lead to failure and possibly to ruin. The second is simply to
ignore the opportunity of breaking into new markets, which is what most
smaller companies do.
Sue Rush, who completed the Scanmark programme in 1984, said: 'It's not only
the giants of industry who need to understand their customers' requirements
but all those who are in business to make money'.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trying to open up an old market -
Nick Garnett on the struggles of a shop for the elderly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT GIVES ME a lot of pleasure seeing elderly people using things I've sold
them. I have just seen a man, who has difficulty walking, with a shoppers'
trolley designed so that you can sit on it. If I hadn't sold that to him he
would not have been out that day and he certainly would not have been
shopping.'
Annette Dand puts a finger on one of the blessings of running some types of
small business. Serving the public often generates gratification, which is
just as well for Dand because the main point of owning a company - making
money - has proved elusive.
As a single parent with a young daughter and a divorce behind her, Dand was
looking for a venture that would allow her flexibility in taking time off.
In 1987 she set up Nanas &amp; Papas, a shop in Leicester selling items for
senior citizens.
The business has survived, no mean achievement in light of the recessionary
death rate among new shops. But in the year to January 1992 pre-tax profit
was just Pounds 6,000 on a miserly turnover of Pounds 44,000. Dand has been
dependent on maintenance from her husband.
These figures paint an overly bleak picture of the company's finances.
During the past six years Dand has been able to generate enough gross profit
to buy close to Pounds 30,000 of stock. Paucity of stock and of capital at
the beginning of the tiny company's life is partly blamed by Dand for the
venture's snail's pace growth.
'I started with Pounds 4,000 of my own money. The banks didn't really want
to know. Funnily enough one bank told me that if I invested Pounds 6,000
they would loan me a similar amount. I'm not much of a gambler and I'm glad
I didn't borrow because of the way interest rates went up. But how can you
start a business properly with just Pounds 3,000 of stock?'
Dand chose premises on the edge of Leicester where customers can park. The
270 sq ft retail unit carried a yearly rent of Pounds 5,000 (now Pounds
6,000). 'There are shops catering for children and I didn't understand why
there were not more shops selling things for elderly people. There is a huge
market out there.'
As the UK's population includes more than 10.5m of pensionable age, that is
probably true. Boots, the chemists, recently introduced a catalogue on
gadgets for the elderly and disabled.
Nanas &amp; Papas started selling gift items suitable for the older generation,
but shifted when a salesman brought in cheap, patterned dresses, perfect for
the elderly age bracket and offered them on sale or return. 'They sold
really well. So I decided not to sell to people buying gifts for old people
but direct to elderly people themselves.'
Nanas &amp; Papas sells needle threaders, walking sticks that double as seats,
trays for carrying one-handed, electric plugs with handles and cutlery with
fat stems for arthritic fingers. There are liberty bodices, socks without
elastic for sufferers of thrombosis, pullovers with seams at the front to
fit droopy shoulders, bed booties to prevent heel sores, and support tights
that help ease varicose veins. Shoes come with wider and deeper fittings
than normal. You can also buy oddities like carpet bowls and easy-to-read
thermometers .
'The biggest problem was finding suppliers. If you have a dress shop you can
just go to a clothes fair. I literally walked round other shops selling some
of these things and went to fairs and exhibitions for gifts, shoes,
equipment for the disabled and other things I sell.'
Another difficulty was locating wholesalers prepared to supply her. 'I
wanted some magazines for the elderly but I'm not a newsagent so I couldn't
go to a wholesaler. I couldn't use a chemist suppliers because I'm not a
pharmacist. I also buy small quantities so I cannot benefit from volume.'
Clothing provides the biggest chunk of revenue and margins there are
healthy. But most of the gadgets sell on mark ups of about 30 per cent, low
for retailing.
Advertising has proved a headache. 'It is difficult to advertise to old
people. They don't seem to believe anything unless it is passed on by word
of mouth. It is also very expensive.' Dand spends about Pounds 1,000 a year
on it. A pensioner working on commission travels for her to all the area's
residential homes.
Dand says that while lack of capital has been a drag on the company's
growth, the business could soon earn her about Pounds 10,000 a year.
She wants to expand either through mail order or franchising. 'I've found
the suppliers so much of the hard work has been done.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Investing in debt - Doing the Splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEZZANINE Capital and Income Trust 2001 is one of the most unusual funds in
the split capital sector. It has a very small portfolio of investments; it
invests mainly in debt, not equities; and it concentrates on unquoted
companies in the US.
But this unusual formula has proved successful. The capital shares of the
trust have been the best performing of all investment trust shares over the
last five years, with a rise of 276.6 per cent to June 1.
The trust was formed in 1986, raising Pounds 28m, at a time when leveraged
buyouts (LBOs) were a highly popular financing tool in the US. LBOs involve
managers raising debt to finance the takeover of companies from their
shareholders. It was argued that giving managers an equity stake in the
business would encourage them to work hard and efficiently; furthermore, the
high level of debt would 'concentrate their minds' on generating cash to pay
the interest.
MCIT buys, as its name suggests, the mezzanine level of debt. Mezzanine debt
is not secured by assets but pays a higher yield than secured debt, to
reflect the higher risk involved. (It is known as mezzanine because it is
the layer between debt and equity). The trust also buys equity stakes in the
buyout companies, giving it the prospect of capital growth should the
company be sold to a competitor or float on the stock market.
The image of leveraged buyouts suffered in the late 1980s, because of a few
prominent corporate failures and the downfall of junk bond king Michael
Milken. To date, the portfolio has had no failures; the managers, US group
Jordan/Zalasnick Advisers, claims this is because of its experience and its
concentration on private companies.
The income shareholders are entitled to all the revenue of the trust; the
capital shareholders receive no income. The capital entitlement of the
shares is more complicated. The first claim on the assets goes to the
capital holders to the extent of Pounds 1 per share; the next claim goes to
income holders, also at Pounds 1 per share; after that, assets are split 90
per cent to the capital shareholders and 10 per cent to the income holders.
According to Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, there are more than
enough assets to repay the capital shareholders at the current share price
of 178p. If the assets grow at 5 per cent per annum, the capital
shareholders will receive a gross redemption yield of 10.9 per cent; 10 per
cent asset growth translates into a gross yield of 17.1 per cent per annum.
For income shareholders, zero growth in assets and dividends would result in
a gross redemption yield of 3.8 per cent per annum; 5 per cent asset growth
would translate into a yield of 9.2 per cent per annum, says Robertson.
As the accompanying bar chart shows, the dividend was cut in the year to
March 31. This reflected a restructuring at one of the group's investments,
American Safety Razor, which issued payment-in-kind notes. American Safety
Razor has floated on the NASDAQ exchange in the US, with the result that
Dollars 7.5m debt has been repaid, including the notes. As a result, MCIT is
paying a special interim dividend of 4p per share, more than making up for
last year's cut.
The trust has a highly concentrated portfolio with just nine stocks. The
ninth was only announced this week - LePage, a tape and sealing products
maker, where the trust is investing Dollars 9m in a combination of debt and
equities.
Valuation is always a key issue at a trust which has large unquoted
holdings. MCIT values its debt at cost and then relies on an independent
valuation of its equity investments by the US group Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette. DLJ, in its report for the year ending March 31, indicated a range
of values from Dollars 31.1m to Dollars 34.9m; MCIT adopted the lower
figure. To date, when investments have been realised, MCIT has achieved an
uplift on the balance sheet valuation.
According to John Korwin Symanowski, of brokers S G Warburg Securities, the
portfolio structure is: loan notes 39.5 per cent; preference stock 4.3 per
cent; unlisted equity 22.5 per cent; listed equity 16.1 per cent; and cash
17.6 per cent.
The concentrated portfolio of the trust makes it higher risk, and its dollar
assets means British investors also face an exchange rate exposure.
Nevertheless, the record-to-date has been excellent. Key facts. As of March
31, the trust had net assets of Pounds 56.4m (including Pounds 12.36m of
cash). The manager's fee is 1.5 per cent of net assets per year. The trust
is due to be wound up in December 2001.
Board. John Green-Armytage, the chairman, is a former managing director of
the Guthrie Corporation. Other directors are: Gary Brass, managing director
of Consulta, a private investment advisory company; Edwin Goodman, a general
partner of Hambro International Venture Fund; James Jordan, an executive
with the Jordan company; and Andrew Withey, senior investment strategist
with James Capel Investment Management.
Savings scheme and Pep details. The trust has no savings scheme and does not
qualify for Pep status.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: . . . but get me to the church on
time - You can insure against most wedding day disasters, including the
vagaries of the British weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEDDING and summer fete season is in full swing during June but, as
usual, the British weather is taking its toll on open-air events.
Rain is one hazard that the organiser of any outdoor event has to consider -
would a downpour force you to cancel the event or affect your takings? If
you think anything more than a drizzle would ruin your day, rather than
crossing your fingers and hoping for sunshine, there is the option of
Pluvius insurance, which allows you to insure against a specified level of
rainfall.
This type of policy can compensate for cancellation, ticket refunds or lost
revenue. It is also known as measured rainfall cover. Naturally, the cost of
cover depends on where in the UK the event is being held - the rainiest
places, such as the Lake District, incur higher premiums - as well as the
sum insured. The organisers of last year's Blairgowrie Highland Games paid
Pounds 415 for cover with Eagle Star. After more than a fifth of an inch of
rain fell in a three-hour period, Eagle Star paid out Pounds 10,000.
If you are running a fishing competition or a kite festival, a wet or windy
day may be essential - so you can also insure against fine weather. However,
you cannot merely listen to the weather forecast the day before and rush to
your insurers if the outlook is bad: insurance must be taken out at least
ten to 14 days in advance.
The oldest provider of Pluvius insurance is Eagle Star, which is still the
market leader after 70 years, and bases its premiums (minimum Pounds 100) on
weather records going back over a century. Other companies, such as
Cornhill, now offer similar policies.
Of course, disastrous weather is just one of many factors which could affect
the success of an event. Other circumstances could force you to cancel - the
star booked to open the fete might not show up, your cash box could be
stolen, or someone could be injured tripping over a marquee rope.
General policies covering charity fairs, boot sales, agricultural shows,
gymkhanas etc can provide cover for a variety of risks, with premiums
depending on the size of the event. Independent Insurance, Insurex
Expo-Sure, Cornhill and Lombard Continental are among companies offering
cover but a broker may be able to advise on what is available.
Weddings are seen as a special case by many insurers. If one reads the list
of contingencies covered by specialist wedding policies, it can seem like a
miracle if a wedding ever passes smoothly.
Snags can include: photographers failing to turn up or forgetting to put
film in their cameras; coffee spills on the bride's dress; theft of gifts;
wedding car breakdown; the reception venue closed by a bomb scare; and a
business going bust soon after the reception booking is made. Illness, death
or unemployment affecting the couple or their close relatives can mean the
whole wedding has to be called off.
Specialist policies will normally cover all the situations described as well
as loss or damage to hired suits, flowers, rings and other wedding
paraphernalia. Cancellation because one half of the couple gets last-minute
cold feet is not covered.
Cornhill's Weddingsurance policy (tel: 0734-575491) costs Pounds 45.
Extensions are available if you want higher cover for a particularly
expensive wedding dress, or need to insure a hired marquee, for instance.
Grand UK insurance (0603-767699) offers a standard wedding insurance package
at Pounds 42.50, with optional honeymoon travel insurance available.
Insurex Expo-Sure (0892-511500) charges Pounds 150 to insure a wedding
costing Pounds 6,000, with up to Pounds 10,000 cover for damage to the
church, reception venue, and the same again for damage to clothing, gifts
and so on.
Leisurecare (0793-514199) has branched out into wedding cover via honeymoon
travel insurance. The price of its package is determined by the amount of
cancellation cover needed: up to Pounds 3,000 costs Pounds 40, up to Pounds
5,000 costs Pounds 60, and quotes can be made for higher figures.
The package also covers re-arrangement expenses, clothing, rings, presents,
photographs, liability etc.
The basic package from Methodist Insurance (061-833-9696) costs Pounds 30
and covers cancellation, wedding attire, photographs, presents and public
liability. Higher levels of cover are available.
Provincial (0539-723415) is planning to revamp its Cupid wedding policy in
September, but offers two options: standard, costing Pounds 30, and deluxe,
with double the cover of standard, costing Pounds 45.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S column is dominated by sales, many of which were option related.
The heaviest selling, however, was in Rathbone Brothers, the investment
management company. In the past Rathbone directors have been prepared to
meet institutional demand with modest sales, but this week's grouping of
nine directors is on an altogether larger scale.
Against a difficult background, and in contrast to many of their peers,
Rathbone Brothers has enjoyed considerable success over the past three
years. Shares sold by directors have been placed with institutions and the
tone of the chairman's most recent statement remained optimistic.
Betterware has been one of the retail success stories of recession. The huge
sales by Stanley Cohen, non-executive vice chairman, and Andrew Cohen,
managing director, follow sustained outperformance over the last 12 months.
The company says the sales were made to satisfy institutional demand. The
Cohens, the directors and their families continue to speak for just over 50
per cent of the equity.
Figures for the selling at T Cowie do not tell the full story. Gordon
Hodgson, chief executive, exercised an option over 200,000 shares and sold
the lot. At the same time however, three other directors exercised options
over 700,000 shares selling a significant number.
These latter transactions are not included in our column because they did
not sell their entire holdings. They did, though, sell almost 400,000 shares
between them.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: 'Unfair' rates of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies which charge 'unfair' rates of interest risk having to
pay compensation to savers after a case handled by the building societies
ombudsmen, says their annual report this week.
Savers have seen their income almost halve since interest rates peaked in
1990. Most complaints to the ombudsmen centred on the failure of societies
to alert investors to new accounts offering higher rates than the ones in
which they had placed their savings.
Although the ombudsmen reiterated their decision, arrived at last year, that
the onus is on investors to be vigilant, they also said that if interest
rates paid were 'unduly low,' these could be held to be unfair even if the
society had publicised them.
This is what happened in a case where investors bought a two-year variable
rate bond with a minimum investment of Pounds 10,000. The society closed the
bond to new investors and then reduced the rate to less than that paid on
tiers above Pounds 10,000 on its 90-day notice account and some tiers of its
instant access account.
Investors knew the rate they were being paid but were powerless to do
anything. The terms of the bond did not allow them to give notice. The
society - which was not named by the ombudsmen - was forced to pay
compensation of up to Pounds 1,400 each to 30 investors.
Complaints about mortgage interest rates rose 35 per cent to 367; most were
about the tardiness of building societies in bringing down their mortgage
rates after a base rate cut.
One particular area of concern was home income plans - complaints nearly
quadrupled to 112 - and complaints about mortgage protection plans. In many
cases, the ombudsmen found themselves tied by their terms of reference which
does not allow them to make decisions about events which happen before a
mortgage or investment is taken out, unless the building societies involved
agree to it.
'It is fundamentally unsatisfactory that our jurisdiction depends on the
building societies agreeing to it,' said Stephen Edell, one of three
ombudsmen who prepared the report.
Nine of the 21 societies against which complaints about home income plans
and equity release schemes were made have refused to co-operate with the
ombudsmen. These are: Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bristol &amp; West, Chelsea, Leeds,
National Counties, Newcastle, Northern Rock, Staffordshire and West
Bromwich.
One case on mortgage protection cover which did fall within the ombudsmen
terms of reference led to the highest compensation - Pounds 22,500 - awarded
during the year.
A customer applied for a mortgage with a society which required him to take
out mortgage protection insurance. He did this through the society. The
mortgage was completed on December 15 1989 but the society did not arrange
cover for him until January 1 1990.
The unemployment insurance excluded the first 90 days of unemployment but he
lost his job more than 90 days after December 15 but less than 90 days after
January 1.
The ombudsmen found that the society was guilty of maladministration and
ordered it to pay the amount the policy would have paid out, as well as
compensation for inconvenience and some legal costs.
The number of initial complaints dropped slightly to 9,402 from 9,525, and
just over half related to mortgages.

high-reward markets

EMERGING stock markets are potentially one of the most exciting investment
areas. They consist of the stock markets of developing countries, mainly in
Latin America and south east Asia, which many experts believe may offer
higher returns than the developed markets of the UK, US and Europe.
The arguments are that developing economies are growing faster than those in
the developed world; that their economies are liberalising and encouraging
foreign investment; and that they are starting to develop domestic
investment institutions (such as pension funds) which will support a
flourishing stock market.
With these extra returns come extra risks. Some economies are prone to
inflation; others to political instability. Traditions such as audited
accounts, the idea that companies are run for the benefit of shareholders,
not managers, are not so well entrenched. The markets are less liquid making
it harder to buy and sell stocks.
Private investors can best tap the potential of emerging markets via one of
the unit and investment trusts specialising in the area. There are arguments
for and against both vehicles. The illiquid nature of emerging markets can
prove a problem for unit trusts; the need to obtain cash to meet redemptions
may force the manager to sell his best holdings at the wrong time.
For an investment trust, emerging markets can go in and out of fashion. When
markets are fashionable, trusts often trade at a premium to net assets; that
is, investors must pay, say, 105p to buy 100p of assets. But when markets
fall from grace, funds can slump to wide discounts, as investors in many of
the offshore closed end funds have found.
These problems and risks are more acute for single country funds. First time
investors would be better off looking at one of the global, or regional,
emerging market funds with a diversified portfolio.
There are seven emerging markets investment trusts in issue, although John
Govett is now launching another and Kleinwort is expected to follow. The
largest (and the best performing over the last three years) is Templeton
Emerging Markets, with a return of 101.2 per cent over the period
(mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested).
However, Templeton is trading at a premium, indicating that there is demand
for more issues in this area. The Govett fund, sponsored by Hoare Govett
Asia, is offering 30m ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants attached
on a one for five basis. The costs of the issue are 4.8 per cent and the
annual management fee is 1.25 per cent; minimum subscription is Pounds
2,500.
Emerging market unit trusts are included in the international equity growth
sector. City of London Emerging Markets is top over one year, with growth of
56.9 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested). It is unusual in that
it invests not directly in equities, but in other managers' closed end
single country funds. Prosperity Emerging Markets is top of the sector over
five years, with growth of 187.3 per cent.
For those seeking exposure to individual countries, there are a number of
single country Asian funds such as Save &amp; Prosper China Dragon and
Providence Capitol Thailand.
Asia attracts a large proportion of emerging markets investment. Strong
economic growth is predicted both this year and next - Govett sees 1994 GNP
growth ranging from 3.4 per cent in the Philippines and 6.2 per cent in
Indonesia, to 9.5 per cent in China and 8 per cent in Malaysia.
Recovery in Japan and the US is expected to boost the export-oriented
economies of the region, and interest rates are falling.
The boom in China has caused much excitement, but many fund managers now see
it as a long-term rather than short-term bet. The expected cooling-off in
China could also affect other countries.
'China is the engine driver of the whole region at the moment, but it is so
difficult to get exposure to China,' says Qais Zakaria of Save &amp; Prosper.
Only a few stocks are listed on the two Chinese exchanges at Shanghai and
Shenzhen, and demand is strong. Hong Kong is a popular proxy, but can be
volatile in response to news from China.
The Taiwanese market's record of boom and bust cycles puts off many
investors; the outflow of funds to China has also affected liquidity. A few
fund managers see some good prospects by the end of 1994.
Zakaria sees Korea and Malaysia as the two markets to watch. Korea should
benefit from the improving US economy and the strong yen, which will allow
Korean companies to increase their margins a little. He thinks profits could
increase by up to 30 per cent.
However, there are technical difficulties to investing in Korea: foreign
holdings of any stock are limited to 10 per cent, and many have reached that
level. Limits are unlikely to be raised for another year.
Govett Oriental has done well in Malaysia and other funds are heavily
weighted there. 'We like the Malaysian economy, we think it is well run,'
says Zakaria, who sees it as a long-term buy. But Ashok Shah of Providence
Capitol warns that the Malaysian market is vulnerable to a reasonably sharp
correction. 'We would advise caution. At best it is a hold.'
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines also have good growth prospects, but
are struggling with structural and political problems.
Another area opening up to foreign investment is the Indian sub-continent,
where economic reforms based on IMF recommendations are starting to work
through in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But some barriers remain. India
imposes a capital gains tax of up to 30 per cent on foreigners. 'You have to
realise if you are an emerging market that you live in a much more
competitive environment. If India puts up barriers, then people say forget
it,' says Charles Fowler, of Govett. However, Tristan Clube, a fund manager
with Martin Currie, says he has been putting more emphasis on the Indian
sub-continent.
Latin America has lost its glow after a bull market run which peaked in
summer 1992 after a series of economic and political reforms. The markets
are very different, ranging from Mexico, the most developed with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 150bn, to the small illiquid markets of Colombia
and Peru. Brazil is the second largest with a market capitalisation of
Dollars 75bn.
Although many fund managers are disappointed about the performance of the
past year, most are still heavily invested in the region. Templeton Emerging
markets investment trust has a 15 per cent holding in Brazil, where the
market has risen by 13 per cent in dollar terms in the year to June 1993.
Brazilian companies are cheap and have good managers, according to Latin
American Securities, but the potential for growth has been hampered by
political setbacks in the past year.
Fleming Emerging Markets investment trust favours Mexico where it has a 17
per cent weighting. Philippa Armitage, fund manager, says that uncertainty
over whether the North American Free Trade Agreement will be supported by
Congress has depressed the market. However, she believes that even if Nafta
is not resolved, Mexico will be able to generate its own growth.
The volatility of this area means that cautious investors should diversify
risk via a regional fund rather than a country fund. Latin American
Investment Trust, which has Dollars 140m under management, has its heaviest
weighting in Mexico and Brazil (53 per cent) but also holds 14 per cent in
Chile, where a fall in interest rates is expected to push the market up.
Europe: Turkey is flavour of the month due to a spectacular performance in
the past year. The market has risen by 61.7 per cent in dollar terms in the
year to June, according to Olliff and Partners, a stockbroking firm
specialising in investment trusts. The growth has been fuelled by domestic
consumption, said Radhika Ajmera, fund manager for the Turkey Trust, the
best performing investment trust in the emerging markets sector, with growth
of just over 60 per cent in the year to June 1, according to Micropal.
Elsewhere in Europe, Olliff and Partners says it feels 'fairly bullish'
about Portugal because of its potential for lower interest rates and
recovery. Isabel Goiri, manager of Schroders Mediterranean investment trust,
which holds roughly half its investments in the European emerging markets
and the rest in France, Italy and Spain, says that 'there is a lot of
catching up to do by the small European countries in the process of European
unification, so the prospects for growth there are higher. Investment in
these countries is also a play on deregulation and liberalisation.'
Interest in Eastern Europe is focused mainly on Poland and Hungary. Poland's
stock market has seen a rise of 200 per cent in dollar terms in the last
three months, according to Goiri, but privatisation issues are limited and
liquidity is tight.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Loan-back boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in loan-back business expansion schemes, who feared retrospective
legislation to ban the schemes, will be pleased that proposed amendments to
the Finance Bill were ruled out of order this week. Loan-back schemes
allowed investors to exit from investments after six months instead of five
years.
The most radical proposal was put forward by Michael Stern, Conservative MP
for Bristol North West, who said he was concerned about tax avoidance
measures.
Stern said this week he had feared Labour could win a vote on retrospective
legislation to ban the schemes at committee stage, as some Tory MPs would be
ineligible to vote because of their own investment in loan-back BES schemes.
He tabled a proposal which he expected to be acceptable to Labour, with the
intention of withdrawing it to pre-empt a similar proposal from them.
Labour said Stern's comments were 'complete rubbish' and that it knew that
retrospective legislation of this type would not be acceptable. Its own more
modest proposals to backdate it by up to a fortnight before the Budget were
also ruled out of order.
However, the 3,000 or so investors in two schemes issued by National
Westminster bank and BZW, will be disappointed that John Watts, conservative
MP and chairman of the Treasury select committee, withdrew a proposal which
would have made the schemes eligible for tax relief.
Although shares in the two schemes had been allotted by the Budget deadline,
the Inland Revenue says they were not issued because the shareholdings were
not listed in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline.
Watts' proposal was that the word 'issued' should be changed to 'allotted.'
He withdrew the proposal because he did not think the committee atmosphere
conducive to a favourable outcome.
NatWest and BZW said this week that they were continuing their legal action
against the Inland Revenue to try to reverse its decision that the schemes
are ineligible for tax relief.
New BES offers this week include a contracted exit and a trading scheme.
Lady Margaret Tenancies sponsored by Capital Ventures aims to raise Pounds
15m to buy houses in Cambridge from St John's college. Investors are given a
contracted exit of Pounds 1.17 for every Pounds 1 invested after five years.
Smiles Traditional Inns, sponsored by Rowan Dartington, will buy six to
eight pubs in the Bristol/Avon area under an agreement with Smiles Brewing.
The latter has been given an option to buy the pubs so that investors will
receive a cash distribution of 175p per 100p invested. If Smiles does not
exercise the option, it is proposed the company be liquidated.

YIELDS ON UK onshore bond funds, have shown little change since we last
published the table on May 15, but fund managers have differing views on
performance outlook.
Bond funds are unit trusts which invest primarily in a range of gilts and
the fixed interest securities of large private companies to produce capital
and income for investors.
Theodora Zemek, fund manager of M &amp; G's gilt income fund, is bullish about
gilts because she believes them to be very cheap, mainly because of market
fears of an oversupply caused by the government's need for new issues to
fund the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement.
The fund, which aims to give a high level of income rather than aiming at
'total return', has been investing in longer dated gilts such as those
maturing in 2011 and in some corporate bonds, such as British Gas's 15-year
bond.
However, David Felder, head of fixed income at Kleinwort Benson, says that
since the gilt market has performed strongly in recent years, aided by the
drop in base rates, caution is needed. Nevertheless, 'there is room for
further mileage because base rates may fall further and gilt yields can come
down a little more, leading to an appreciation in the market.' He expects
further capital gains, although these will be weak and modest.
The initial charge on the fund is 5.5 per cent and the annual fee is 0.5 per
cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. The minimum investment in M &amp;
G's fund is Pounds 500, there is no front-end charge and the annual fee is
0.75 per cent.
Permanent Interest Bearing Shares. These are shares issued by a building
society to raise capital. Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of
basic-rate tax. Gains are exempt from CGT unless the Pibs are sold in a
packaged unit trust. Pibs are deeply subordinated so that if the society
collapsed, holders would be last in the line of creditors. These risks are
reflected in the yields, which are higher than for bond funds.
Prices have once again increased since the last table on May 15, with a
corresponding drop in yields.
Newcastle building society launched a second issue of Pibs this week. Simon
Mozley, of Hoare Govett, said: 'The new issue came at 240 basis points over
the gilt, which is somewhat tight compared to issues by larger societies but
it represents a yield pick-up on the existing issue.'
Dealers say that spreads on Pibs issues have tightened partly because of
strong demand from retail investors.

BRITISH Steel's results for the year to the end of March, to be announced on
Monday, are expected to show pre-tax losses of Pounds 170m reflecting
recession and overcapacity in Europe.
Analysts will be more interested to hear the company's views on whether
further price rises are possible this year. The outlook for talks on
capacity reduction between the EC and state owned steelmakers is also likely
to be raised.
Attention will be focused on whether provisions for bad and doubtful debts
are starting to ease in the UK banks' sector when TSB Group announces
interim results on Thursday. TSB is the first of the banks to report by a
month.
The pre-tax profit for the half year is forecast to fall to about Pounds 50m
compared to Pounds 92m the previous year, and bad debt provisions to rise to
around Pounds 240m from Pounds 165m. The bank is expected to maintain its
interim dividend.
The impact of exceptional costs of about Pounds 3m from its photo-processing
business will cloud the picture at London International Group, which reports
annual results on Friday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds
31.5m under FRS 3, compared with last year's figure of Pounds 16.9m, which
was also depressed by restructuring costs of Pounds 22.5m. The ColorCare
photoprocessing business continues to suffer from lack of demand, but the
Durex condom business is growing steadily.
First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions
group, will be quizzed for signs of a recovery in consumer confidence when
it reports interim results on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting a slight rise
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.7m to about Pounds 12m in the six months
to May 3, but the group's results are skewed towards the second half and
most attention will surround market conditions and the trading outlook.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BT's chance to repeat its success
story - Andrew Adonis and Philip Coggan analyse whether the latest BT share
offer has attractions for private investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON PAST performance, BT is a good buy. In the first seven years after
privatisation, BT's pre-tax profits increased every year, rising from Pounds
1.4bn in 1985 to Pounds 3.08bn in 1991. In 1992 profits stabilised; in the
year to March 31 this year they fell to Pounds 1.97bn, but allowing for the
company's massive redundancy programme, earnings per share still rose.
Analysts are forecasting profits of over Pounds 3bn this year.
BT's share price, up from 240p at the start of 1988 to a high of 445p this
year, has markedly outperformed the FT-A All Share index over the period.
Dividends have increased every year since privatisation, rising from a net
6.5p per share in 1985 to 15.6p for the year to March 1993.
The gross yield on the fully paid shares is 4.7 per cent, and the price
earnings ratio 19.6. With the final dividend for the 1992/93 year payable on
the 150p partly-paid shares, and the interim dividend due before the second
instalment is payable, the prospective gross yield on the partly-paid shares
is 13.3 per cent.
BT even seems to be regulator- and recession-proof. Profits have prospered
in spite of successive price caps imposed by the regulator Oftel. Turnover
rose marginally between 1991 and 1992, and fell only from Pounds 13.3bn in
1991/92 to Pounds 13.2bn in 1992/93. With underlying turnover growth of 2.8
per cent in the quarter to March 31, BT looks set to match the revival in
the UK economy.
Add in the bonuses for the small investor, the low returns available
elsewhere, and cheap dealing offers, and the blandishments of Inspector
Morose are hard to resist.
However, as UBS's latest BT research bulletin notes: 'BT's track record as a
guide to future performance has declined over time.' This, it argues, is
because BT will lose market share to new operators; and because volume
growth for BT will translate into lower levels of revenue growth as the
price cap becomes progressively tighter.
Both points carry weight. BT's price cap is set to tighten by a further 1.25
per cent in August, from the retail price index minus 6.25 per cent to RPI
minus 7.5 per cent for each of the four years until 1997. In a period of low
inflation, BT will have to work exceptionally hard to sustain turnover
growth.
The UK telecoms market place is getting more competitive by the month. In
the international market, companies reselling leased lines are undercutting
BT prices; in the trunk market, two new companies are constructing national
networks; while in the local market, cable TV companies are offering
telephone services at discounts to BT.
Then there is BT's global strategy. The merits of last month's decision to
spend nearly Dollars 5bn of shareholders' funds on a grand alliance with
MCI, the second largest US carrier, have yet to be proven. Of the Dollars
5bn, Dollars 4.3bn is, in effect, a straight investment in the US carrier;
the rest is for a joint venture intended to make BT the prime supplier of
telecoms services to the world's multinational companies.
Success depends upon the market for multinationals appearing, and upon MCI
sustaining its remarkable success in gaining market share from entrenched US
operators. Neither venture is assured.
Small investors should not believe BT has a licence to print money.
Nonetheless, most analysts do not believe BT is set on a downward path.
Take competition. In its nine years of operation, Mercury has secured barely
eight per cent of the market. In the long term, new entrants could be a
significant threat, but most projections show BT losing only some two to
three per cent of market share for the next few years - and that in a fast
growing market.
Nor is BT standing still. In the past three years the company has shed
nearly a third of its staff; and a further 30,000 are set to go in the next
two years. With improved efficiency is coming improved service quality and a
sharper marketing strategy.
As to BT's overseas adventures, its bid for a global role looks plausible in
a more integrated international business world for which advanced
communications are the lifeblood. And should the worst happen, BT could blow
a billion or two without too much pain.
How to buy
The government likes to use privatisations as a means of encouraging wider
share ownership, hence the concept of 'share shops' which is being trotted
out again, as it was for BT2.
However, in striving to ensure that the offer is successful, the government
has made buying shares in BT complicated.
There are two routes for private investors, the public offer and the retail
tender. The latter is designed for larger private investors and those who
want to put BT shares into a personal equity plan.
Shares are being sold in three instalments. The first instalment is 150p for
those who apply through the public offer (see below). The second instalment,
payable in March 1994, will be 140p. The third instalment will be payable in
October 1994; the price will be set later.
The price of 150p on the first instalment of the public offer represents a
discount to the price which will be paid by the institutions, but the size
of that discount will not be set until June 29.
The public offer. Those who want to apply for shares via the public offer
can choose between two routes; by calling the share information office
(081-200-3000) or by registering via one of 150 'share shops'. Most major
banks, many building societies and leading stockbrokers are acting as share
shops.
The share shop route is best. For a start, those who apply via a share shop
will receive preference when it comes to allocating shares. Furthermore,
many of the share shops are offering cut price dealing rates, or other
attractions, for registrants.
It is especially important for those who were pre-registered (automatically
the case for BT shareholders and employees) to realise this. Unless they
register again with a share shop, they will not head the queue for
allocations.
Bottom of the pile when shares are handed out will be members of the public
who did not register with the share information office or a share shop. Next
in line will be people who register with the SIO, but who were not
previously BT shareholders. Above them are ranked existing BT shareholders,
or those who register via a share shop (preference between these two classes
will be decided later). Top of the list (apart from employees) will be
existing BT shareholders who register with a share shop.
There is nothing to stop investors registering with the share information
office and with one, or more, share shops. However, they can only make one
application on their own behalf through the public offer (other family
members are entitled to apply separately).
Investors have a choice of further incentives to buy the shares. They can
opt for 10p off the price of the second and third instalments.
Alternatively, they can have one bonus share for every 15 shares they hold
until July 31, 1996, subject to a maximum of 150 bonus shares.
The minimum application allowed in the public offer, which closes on July
14, is for 120 shares, or Pounds 180.
The retail tender. This route is for those who want the maximum number of
shares. In addition, those people who want to put their shares in a Pep (see
below) will get preferential treatment in the tender.
The 'cut off point' is that those who apply for more than 2,000 shares will
get better treatment in the retail tender than in the public offer. Indeed,
2,000 shares is the minimum for tender applicants (except for those who want
a Pep).
The disadvantage of the tender route is that investors will not get the
incentives available via the public offer, ie no discount on any of the
instalments and no bonus shares. The price they pay will be determined with
reference to the bids of the institutions for shares.
The only way of applying via the retail tender is through a stockbroker. A
full list of those taking part will not be available until June 29. The
retail tender closes on July 16.
Personal Equity Plans. Share offers which come in several instalments create
headaches for private investors. You cannot have part of a share in a Pep
and part outside it.
The first two instalments lie in the current tax year, so Pep investors must
allow for this. If you want to put your BT shares in a single company Pep,
then you can effectively apply for 1,000 shares. This is the minimum allowed
under the tender rules, and the two instalments would cost you Pounds 2,900,
just under the annual Pounds 3,000 limit for a single company Pep. You will
also have to use up part of your single company allowance in 1994-95, to
meet the third instalment.
Those who want to put their shares in a general Pep will probably opt for
2,000 shares. The two instalments would cost Pounds 5,800, just under the
Pounds 6,000 allowance. Part of next year's Pep will be needed to meet the
third instalment.
Where to buy
As there are 150 share shops, it is difficult to produce a comprehensive
list of deals. Some brokers have yet to decide on their dealing rates.
Furthermore, share shops have been discouraged from over-emphasising their
cheap selling services, on the grounds that the government wants to promote
the long term attractions of BT shares.
Many share shops will not be participating in the retail tender, and a full
list is not yet available. So once investors have found a share shop (they
have their own bull and bear logo), they should ask whether they can use it
for the tender.
The following offers are among those currently available:
Barclays Bank is offering to deal for a minimum of Pounds 12.50 through its
share shop, and its Barclayshare Portfolio Administration and Barclayshare
Advisory Services. Those who apply through the share shop can also trade
Abbey National, Barclays Bank, British Gas and TSB shares at Pounds 12.50.
Up to four family members can lump together deals at no extra charge.
Dunbar, Boyle &amp; Kingsley (071-247-8898) will deal at 1 per cent, with a
minimum of Pounds 15. Up to ten holdings can be batched together at no extra
charge so six holdings at Pounds 250 each would be charged Pounds 15 in
total. Killik (071-515-0398) operates a postal dealing service for a flat
Pounds 10 fee. The broker needs the share certificate and the transfer deed
before it can deal.
Lloyds Bank is offering a selling commission of 1 per cent, with a minimum
of Pounds 11. National &amp; Provincial BS (0800-220396) will deal in BT3 shares
for a flat Pounds 9.75 via a postal service. Up to three further family
members can deal for Pounds 2.50.
National Westminster Bank is offering a minimum commission of Pounds 17 on
BT shares, and on 450 leading shares. A postal service is available at 1 per
cent commission, with a minimum of Pounds 9.95. Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS
will deal in 35 privatisation stocks, including BT3 for a minimum of Pounds
9.50 for customers who register with the society, or its stockbroking arm,
Waters Lunniss (0603-622265).
The Skipton BS (0532-342444) is offering to deal at 1 per cent, with a
minimum of Pounds 15, for those who register with it. Up to three further
family members can deal for an extra Pounds 4.50 each. John Siddall
(061-832-7471) is offering to deal for those who register with the broker.
In addition, applicants will receive vouchers entitling them to make three
further trades for a total commission of Pounds 10.
Peps
Barclays Bank is waiving its Pep fees for BT registrants. Broker Henderson
Crosthwaite (0800-581206) has a self-select Pep (both single company and
general), with an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. There is no initial charge
for those putting in BT3 shares.
John Siddall is offering a Pep with no initial charge and an annual fee of
0.5 per cent plus VAT.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Utilities and the lure of income - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE INVESTORS have come to know and love the utilities sector. In part,
this is because it consists almost entirely of privatised companies, which
the government has done its best to sell at an attractive price (see the
package on BT on page III). But it is also because the nature of the
businesses, providing everyday needs such as electricity and water to
everybody, helps protect against the cyclical downturns that afflict other
sectors such as retailing.
So a portfolio of utility stocks would seem a natural for the private
investor. Hence the launch this week of Johnson Fry's Utilities Trust.
When writing about new issues last week, I suggested that investors should
always look to see if there was an existing trust covering the same field
trading at a discount. This caveat does not apply to the Johnson Fry fund,
since there is no existing investment trust specialising in utilities.
Perhaps that is surprising, although the utilities sector is still
relatively new. Cazenove launched a unit trust with a high utility content
earlier this year, Gartmore also has a utility unit trust.
Both the Cazenove and the Johnson Fry funds focus on one particular aspect
of the utilities' attractions: their ability to pay high, and increasing,
dividends. With many private investors desperate for income at a time of 6
per cent base rates, this is a natural marketing ploy.
However, the quality of the dividends paid by utilities has already been
recognised by the stock market, with the result that yields in the sector
have fallen. Cazenove addressed this problem by topping up with bonds;
Johnson Fry is achieving the same end by using preference shares.
The Johnson Fry trust also intends to earn extra income in the options
market. It will write call options (giving other people the right to buy
shares at a set price) against part of its utility holdings. This will earn
premium income, but it does mean that the trust may have to give up some
capital growth.
But even these devices were not enough. The higher the income you can offer
these days, the more money you can raise. The portfolio Johnson Fry is
assembling will yield 7.7 per cent (6.75 per cent after charges). By giving
the trust a split capital structure, Johnson Fry can boost the income to 9
per cent.
How is this magic achieved? All the revenue will flow to the income shares
which constitute three quarters of the trust. So instead of revenue of
Pounds 6.75 being earned on Pounds 100 of capital, the same revenue is
earned on Pounds 75, giving a 9 per cent yield. Put those shares into a
Personal Equity Plan, and you have an appealing return.
You cannot, of course, have something for nothing. The other class of shares
in the trust is a zero dividend preference share, which has first claim on
the assets. The trust's assets must grow at 3.7 per cent for the income
shareholders to expect repayment in 2003 at 100p. That may not seem a
daunting rate but remember that 25 per cent of the trust is in fixed rate
preference shares, which are unlikely to grow at all. So in effect, the
required growth rate from the utility portion of the portfolio is 5 per cent
per year.
Of course, that could be achieved (much may depend on future inflation). But
investors should realise that buying the income shares could involve them in
turning some of their capital into income.
There are further risks. The current government could impose a tougher
regulatory regime on the utilities, perhaps in response to consumer unrest
about excess profits or higher prices. A Labour government could even
renationalise part of the sector. Doubts must also exist about how well the
trust will perform, given that Johnson Fry has no record in the investment
trust field.
One aspect of the issue which may appeal is the chance to convert old
privatised utility holdings into income shares. Such old holdings can, of
course, be sold through a conventional stockbroker but, given the small size
of the allocations in privatisations, minimum dealing commissions can take a
hefty bite out of the proceeds.
Johnson Fry will buy utility holdings at the bid price at no dealing cost.
However, it will only perform this service for those who are investing
Pounds 3,000 in cash, on top of any exchanged shares.
What about the zeros? They offer a redemption yield of 9 per cent, if held
until the trust's anticipated wind-up date in 2003. The return on the zeros
is taxed as capital gain, not income, and so may well appeal to higher rate
taxpayers who have not used up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in
1993-94). Furthermore, the zeros look very safe. The trust will have more
than enough assets at outset to repay the zeros at their final redemption
value - the cover figure (to use the industry jargon) will be 157 per cent.
Those who need immediate income will probably ignore the zeros. (They could
in theory buy a large chunk of zeros, sell 9 per cent each year, and take
the proceeds as income. Whether this makes sense depends on the dealing
costs).
Are the income shares worth buying? If held in a Pep, they attract an extra
charge of Pounds 30, which reduces the yield on Pounds 6,000 to 8.5 per
cent. Viewed purely as an income play, that is reasonably appealing. It is
higher than the 7 per cent yield on the Cazenove unit trust, although that
fund is less exposed to the risk of capital loss.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Scare stories put a little fizz into trading - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a week for quashing scare stories on Wall Street.
The most bizarre of these tales concerned PepsiCo, the soft drinks company,
which found itself at the centre of a national product tampering fright.
People across the US suddenly began alleging that they had found objects,
mainly hypodermic needles and syringes, in cans of Diet Pepsi. One man was
interviewed on television describing how a needle pricked his lip as he
sipped Pepsi from the can.
But by the end of the week the scare seemed to have all the elements of a
sick hoax. The US Food and Drug Administration said it had been unable to
confirm even one case of tampering and Pepsi declined to withdraw the
product from retailers' shelves, stressing that it had no evidence of
interference with the Diet Pepsi production process.
Wall Street's fears of accelerating inflation received similar treatment
this week when the federal government released May's consumer price index.
For weeks the markets had been fretting about a sharp upturn in inflation in
the first four months of the year, when consumer prices grew at an annual
rate of 4.3 per cent, compared to 2.9 per cent in all of 1992.
The Federal Reserve had hinted that it would tighten monetary policy for the
first time in four years if the trend persisted - a move which would have
probably prompted a sharp stock market correction.
In the event, May's consumer price figures, released on Tuesday, showed a
scant 1 per cent rise. That confirmed the evidence of the previous Friday -
when the producer price index showed no increase for May  - that inflation
presents no immediate threat to the US.
This may keep downward pressure on bond yields and give support to stock
market valuations. But the equity market may be unable to make much progress
beyond the trading range of the past month - when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average has moved between 3490 and 3560 - without overcoming its anxiety
over the second quarter results season, which begins in mid-July.
The US economy seems to be growing solidly, if unspectacularly, at around a
3 per cent annual rate, but that still leaves room for some nasty earnings
surprises, both at home and among multi-nationals exposed to weak markets in
Europe and Japan.
The airline sector fuelled these anxieties this week when USAir - in which
British Airways holds a minority stake - and then AMR, parent company of
American Airlines, the nation's largest, issued profits warnings.
American said its earnings in the second quarter would be 'significantly
worse' than analysts' forecasts, which had been pitched around net income of
Dollars 75m. It blamed lower-than-anticipated traffic in May, which was
continuing into June, and said international performance was 'very weak.'
USAir warned that it would show after-tax losses for both the quarter and
1993 as a whole.
The warnings sent airline stocks in general sharply lower, since it dashed
hopes that the business was finally turning the corner after nearly three
years of record losses.
HJ Heinz, the foods group, found its stock under pressure after it announced
a Dollars 192m pre-tax charge against fourth quarter earnings to pay for a
range of cost-cutting moves, involving an 8 per cent cut in its worldwide
workforce of 35,500.
Tony O'Reilly, Heinz's chairman, said this would help speed up productivity
improvements and concentrate a three-year rationalisation programme into a
year. But analysts said the action was a sign of the price pressures being
put on big consumer products companies by the extremely competitive
retailing industry, and several lowered their forecasts of Heinz's 1994
earnings.
Kay Whitmore, the embattled chairman of photographic products group Eastman
Kodak, scarcely got a more enthusiastic reception on Wall Street when he
announced plans to spin off the group's chemicals company as a separately
quoted company.
Whitmore is facing strong shareholder pressure to improve Kodak's lacklustre
earnings and analysts had long urged him to dispose of the chemicals
business. So when the announcement finally came, it was distinctly
anti-climactic and was seen as one small step in the group's struggle to
turn around.
The spin-off is just an hors d'oeuvre, designed to satisfy Wall Street's
hunger for action before Whitmore unveils his master plan for Kodak in
September. But if that fails to impress, there will be some real flashing of
sharp instruments.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Chancellor dances on his bed of nails - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PICTURE of the week was of Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
walking on a bed of nails at the annual Chancellery children's party.
He had rolled up the trousers of his double-breasted suit and removed his
shoes and socks. He even looked happy, grinning and spreading his arms wide.
No doubt the children were rather impressed too.
Of course, walking on nails is a confidence trick. At a similar event in
London this week, Britain's new finance minister accomplished another.
Kenneth Clarke's performance at the Mansion House dinner on Tuesday was an
equal display of bravura. He stood on the metaphorical bed of nails,
managing to say nothing while giving the impression of doing something
really quite difficult, and drawing the admiration of the crowd.
His instincts, he assured the assembled party-goers, are tax cutting
instincts - he did not bother to remind anyone that taxes will rise even if
no new increases are announced in the November budget. Meanwhile, public
spending - if the cabinet can stick to its collective hymn sheet, which
seems to be open at All Things Bright and Beautiful - is to be tightly
controlled.
While Clarke did not unpack a new economic policy when he moved to Number 11
Downing Street, he has brought a new tone. It is one of confidence, and was
backed up this week by a bunch of economic statistics which on the whole
suggest that the recovery is gathering strength, without reviving inflation.
The truth is, as Norman Lamont knows only too well, that Clarke can sit on
his hands and still expect to be hailed as the best chancellor of the
exchequer for many a year. The economy is reviving, unemployment has fallen
for a fourth month in a row, and inflation is low. So long as inflation is
held in check - which could be achieved by allowing sterling to appreciate
gently - everything in Clarke's garden could indeed be looking lovely; so
much so that he will be looking over the wall into Number 10.
Economists had already been upgrading forecasts for economic growth this
year and next in a quiet way. Higher growth rates make the government's tax
and spending numbers look much better.
Yesterday BZW, the stockbroker, cut its forecast of the government's
borrowing requirement for this financial year and next's. The reduction for
1993-94 is from a forecast of Pounds 48bn to Pounds 45bn, still a formidable
total but every Pounds 3bn helps.
Nick Knight, of Nomura Research Institute, the Japanese securities house, is
as usual more bullish. Next week he heads for Tokyo to tell investors there
to pile into the UK markets, impishly suggesting that Nippon Life could fund
the whole of this year's PSBR through one bought deal.
The confidence trick seems to be working in the foreign exchange markets
too, with sterling perking up this week and topping DM 2.50. There was even
talk of another base rate cut coming, although perversely the better the
news on the recovery the less the chance of interest rates falling.
All this is wonderful news for the gilt-edged market which has had a good
week. Low inflation - only 1.3 per cent on the RPI measure - makes yields of
8 1/2 per cent or so attractive. Japanese long bonds yield 4 1/2 per cent,
and Japan does not even have a prime minister.
A happier gilt market gives support to equities too, where yields of around
4 per cent are still high relative to inflation. And revised economic growth
forecasts should push up earnings estimates.
It is perhaps curious that the Footsie index has only risen 17.6 points this
week. But that can be put down to the approaching half year end, with fund
managers delaying action until after the valuations have been fixed.
It might also reflect concern about amount of new shares coming on offer.
The Pounds 5bn-plus BT 3 share sale is looming larger since the discounts
and incentives for retail investors were announced on Monday.
The Stock Exchange and SG Warburg, the securities firm which is organising
the sale, spent much of the week arguing behind the scenes over whether BT
shares should be traded mainly on a cash settlement basis in the run up to
the sale.
Warburg wanted deals to be done that way so it could see just what the big
investors were up to in the shares - particularly who was selling shares in
the hopes of buying back cheaper in the sale.
Warburg, which has been remarkably successful in winning privatisation
business could have punished short sellers by allocating fewer shares to
them.
At first the Stock Exchange seemed to be going along with the idea. By
Friday, though, the Stock Exchange had back pedalled somewhat after
institutional investors threw a collective wobbly.
The Exchange then demanded that from Monday until the sale date of July 16,
bargains of over 100,000 shares must be notified to the Stock Exchange.
Warburg's other issue, the Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights which closes on
Monday, was looking distinctly more cheerful by Friday night, with the
shares closing at 622p compared the 600p rights price. And MEPC was the last
of the big seven property companies to raise new equity this year, with a
Pounds 221.9m rights issue taking the total to over Pounds 1bn. If that
seems a lot, it is worth noting that a sausage skin manufacturer can be
valued at Pounds 224m - as Devro International was earlier this week.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Kenneth Clarke's very own smokescreen - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW SPEECHES have received such an absurd degree of undeserved attention as
this week's peroration in the Guildhall from Kenneth Clarke.
I say this without any disrespect to the new chancellor who charmed the City
dignitaries while offering no obvious hostages to fortune. The point is
rather that expectations of the man, whether for good or ill, are wildly
overblown.
One group, with a strong anti-inflationary bias, is busy looking between the
lines for evidence that Clarke will prove a worthy successor to Maudling,
Barber and Lawson. It seeks to establish the precise means by which he will
wreck the economy on his way to Number 10 Downing Street. A powerful
sub-text is the desire for an independent Bank of England to pin the feet of
this dangerous populist to the ground.
At the other extreme are those who want the genial health risk from
Nottingham, with his penchant for a pint and a cheap cigar, to go for growth
and bring down unemployment. For them, the restoration of Britain's
manufacturing base is the preferred route to recovery.
One can sympathise, up to a point, with either camp. The people who worry
about another inflationary dash for growth have plenty of history on their
side, together with intellectual underpinning from public choice theorists.
These are the academics who talk about the economics of politics and refer
to people in Whitehall as rational utility maximisers - ie, a bunch of
blackguards who cynically manipulate the system in their own personal and
political interests.
The same academics also worry about a politically engineered business cycle
and throw in a good economic argument in support. While it is widely
accepted that there is no long term trade-off between inflation and
unemployment, there is undoubtedly a short term trade-off. This the
politicians can exploit for electoral advantage at the cost of more
inflation later for the same level of output. An independent central bank
would help correct the in-built inflationary bias.
As for the pro-growth lobby, its members can reasonably argue that global
commodity inflation is no longer a pressing threat. Moreover, electorates
and markets have grown wise to the ways of politicians, which makes it
harder for them to debauch the currency in their pursuit of growth.
The trouble with both sets of arguments is that they attribute superhuman
powers to the politicians. Even if Clarke really is a blackguard, it is
questionable whether he would or could do the evil deed intentionally. Each
new set of ex-chancellor's memoirs unfailingly reveals a world where
ministers and their officials live in a statistical fog, in which all
forecasts are wrong and nobody really understands how the economy works
anyway.
Moreover, the central perception of public choice theory that governments
create budget surpluses less readily than they create deficits is irrelevant
when all the leading economies bar Japan are already substantially in
deficit. How will Clarke use fiscal policy to maximise his personal utility,
starting with a budget deficit equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP?
As for monetary policy, the striking feature of its workings in the US,
which has a huge overhang of debt, is that successive reductions in interest
rates and continuing dollar weakness have failed to spring more than a
modest and fragile recovery.
Britain looks set for a similar experience. With 1 1/2 m or more labouring
under the burden of mortgages that exceed the value of their homes, it will
take much more than another point off the mortgage rate to bring back the
house price spiral.
Nor will last September's devaluation have much inflationary fall-out when
Germany is casting a deflationary spell over Europe, the dynamic Asian
economies are beginning to impose painful structural adjustment on the
Community and supply is utterly elastic. As Brian Reading, of Lombard Street
Research, remarked, we have the very opposite of too much money chasing too
few goods.
This does not mean the inflation threat has gone for ever. But it certainly
looks premature. Indeed, it is hard to conceive of a worse moment to unleash
an independent central bank, whatever the intrinsic merits.
As for growth, it stems ultimately from the cost-conscious pursuit of
productivity. Few chancellors manage to be cost-conscious, whatever their
aspirations and rhetoric. None can enhance productivity directly.
In short, neither conspiracy nor salvation is wholly within Clarke's gift.
But he can always change the price of a pint and a cheap cigar.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trusts win tax concession - At
a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The unit trust industry scored a success this week after intensive lobbying.
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the treasury, committed the
government to introduce legislation in the next Finance Bill to allow unit
trusts to pay income gross to non-UK residents. This would allow onshore UK
trusts to compete with other collective funds, based in Luxembourg and
Dublin. The government also decided to remove an anomaly, relating to the
change in advance corporation tax in this year's Budget, which might have
led to the sale of substantial unit trust holdings by UK life companies.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Dollar strengthens against DM - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar strengthened against the D-Mark this week and hit its highest
level since March 1992, in spite of US economic indicators which might have
been expected to weaken the currency. By Friday afternoon the dollar was up
5 1/2 pfennigs on the week at DM1.6795, after finally breaking through the
DM1.67 barrier which had defeated it during rallies earlier in the year.
Speculation has been growing that the D-Mark is losing its status as the
anchor currency in the ERM. Comments made last week by George Soros, the
global investor, that the D-Mark was suffering from long-term weakness, also
influenced the market.

Nikkei - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty over the Japanese political situation this week pushed the
Nikkei share index under the 20,000 mark for the first time since April 26.
Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, lost a parliamentary vote of
no confidence on Friday. Parliament was dissolved, and a snap election is
now due to be called by the end of July. The news came after the close of
the Tokyo stock exchange, but jitters in the run-up to the confidence vote
depressed the Nikkei share index, which closed down 120.97 at 19,804.54 on
Friday. Further large falls are not expected as political factors have
already been discounted. The yen continued to weaken against the dollar.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Rebecca's story: How I climbed Everest - The complexities of
scaling the world's highest peak are infinite. Rebecca Stephens tells how
she solved them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS our last chance. Our last attempt on the summit of Everest. The
season was drawing to a close - the monsoon encroaching  - and talk was of
cold beers in Namche Bazaar. This was it. Our last moment - and the Sherpas
thought it too dangerous to climb.
'Guys, don't give up on me now. Please not now.' These were my thoughts as
Sherpas Ang Pasang and Kami Cheri lay huddled in a small, domed tent. Cheri
Zhambu and myself were in another, positioned for a summit bid from the
South Col. 'There's black cloud in the valley. Not good weather. We're
young,' they cried.
'Well,' I mused, 'the perfect excuse.' A large part of me thought: 'I can go
back to bed, put my head down, forget the whole bloody thing.'
But another part of me wanted that summit. Was making a decision always so
impossibly hard? To go or not to go. It had seemed that way for as long as I
could remember. Choice is a terrible thing. Until Everest I had thought
climbing easy - not physically easy, necessarily, but simple. There was only
one aim: to climb to the top. No buses to catch, timetables to meet; no
finances to juggle, bathrooms to clean, taxmen or editors to appease. No
clutter.
Everest put an end to that. Everest, by virtue of its sheer size, makes
complicated all things that should be simple. Camps need to be established:
tents, sleeping bags, stoves, billies, food and drinks put in place. Oxygen,
too - for those who use it  - needs to be positioned. And teams are large:
nine round-eyes in our case, and seven Sherpas. A lot of people. A lot of
variables - before counting the biggest variable of all: the weather. On a
high mountain, that is crucial.
I was tired of decision-making. Twice in the last week I had thought we
should have made a bid for the summit when, in the event, circumstances for
our team dictated otherwise; and twice I had watched tens of climbers
ascend, and descend triumphant.
But one more chance - just one, a slim one  - presented itself. We had been
to Camp 4 on the South Col, retreated, and were now at Camp 2, 22,500ft, at
the foot of the Lhotse Face.
Was it only yesterday, Camp 2? It felt an age. I remember John Barry, the
expedition leader, saying: 'It'll be a monumental test of will.' He was
referring to the climb, to having to retrace steps from Camp 2 to Camp 4;
and he was right - almost. The hard bit was not the climb itself; it was
summoning the energy to pack my rucksack, put on my harness, my boots and
crampons and set off, again. So nearly I didn't bother. The forecast was for
45 pushing 50 knot winds and I convinced myself I would be walking into
failure. I would climb to the Col - that ghastly, inhospitable, frightening
place - only to have to retreat once more. My chance of success, I thought,
was no more than one in a hundred.
'You're a realist,' said Sandy Scott, our doctor. 'I'd have said three to
four per cent.'
I was scared, too. Suddenly I found myself in a situation in which I was
talking in the first person singular. I would be alone. I had assumed,
because it was the case, that John would be making a second attempt with me.
But he had made his choice. He had stayed a third night on the South Col to
look after another climber, Harry, who was snowblind after his oxygenless
ascent. The South Col is at 26,000 ft - too high to expect to feel good. Too
high, in fact, to sustain life, without oxygen, for more than a couple of
days.
'But you won't be on your own,' Sandy said gently. 'You'll be with Ang
Pasang and Kami Cheri, and Cheri Zhambu.' The Sherpas twice as strong and
twice as fast on the hill as any man I had met, and always smiling. But I
had never climbed with them - and it would be me making all the decisions.
'They know this mountain better than anyone,' said Sandy. Ang Pasang and
Kami Cheri both had been to the South Summit several times. 'And they're
cautious,' he said. I felt ashamed. Sandy was right. The Sherpas would look
after me.
The four of us set off together from Camp 2 at 5am. Dawn was just breaking.
Once on our way we travelled quickly, across the head of the Khumbu glacier
in the Western Cwm and up the steep Lhotse Face. I was hugely advantaged. On
our first attempt we had used oxygen from Camp 3, at about 24,000ft, a
little over half way up the face. The oxygen bottles were British, solid and
strong to meet British standards, which was great, except that each bottle
weighed a hefty 6.5kg, and that was without the brass attachments, regulator
and mask.
For the second attempt we handed over an astronomical sum of money to the
New Zealanders for their spare titanium bottles, made in Russia. They were
the best: small, simple to use, and most important, light. I had plenty of
them. I plugged in at Camp 2 and shot up the fixed ropes to Camp 3 in under
four hours. Previously, my best time, without oxygen, had been 5 1/2 hours.
We stopped for a quick brew in our tent at Camp 3, perched on the tiniest
snowy shelf between seracs, and then went on our way, across the Lhotse Face
 -just a walk really  - and up and over the Geneva Spur to the South Col.
Cheri Zhambu and I were on the Col by 1pm. We were last. Ang Pasang and Kami
Cheri had raced ahead and were already ensconced in their tent, brewing us
tea.
I loved watching them. They were so dextrous. They were small - Cheri Zhambu
was tiny, about 5 ft 2in. But the efficiency of their movements amazed me.
The tent I shared with Cheri Zhambu was full of snow, littered with food
wrappings and sort of crescent - shaped. It had been domed once - in fact
the last time that I was in it  - but the poles had buckled in the wind and
the canvas collapsed. It was chaos and yet Cheri Zhambu managed to sort the
oxygen, dry his feet, man the radio and half exit the tent to collect snow
for a brew, all without knocking over the 'boil-in-a-bag' warming on the
stove in the corner. I did nothing. I was not allowed to.
Seven pm and we put our heads down, just for a couple of hours. Didn't
sleep, just rested.
'Cheri Zhambu,' I whispered.
He stirred.
'Cheri Zhambu, there's no wind.'
I could hardly believe it: the forecast was as wrong as it was possible to
be.
Cheri Zhambu sat bolt upright - it was 10pm, we planned to leave at 11pm -
and immediately lit the stove for a brew.
It takes a while, all this brewing, collecting and melting snow, but an hour
or so passed and I got the distinct impression something was up. The Sherpas
 -Ang Pasang and Kami Cheri in the other tent, and Cheri Zhambu in mine -
were talking among themselves in Nepali.
'What's up?' I asked Cheri Zhambu.
'Weather not good.'
'But there's no wind,' I retorted. I stuck my head out of the tent: the
mountain was clear; the sky full of stars.
'Ang Pasang says black cloud in valley. Too dangerous.'
There was only one thing for it. I put on my boots, tripped out of my tent
and into theirs.
'Ang Pasang?'
'Black cloud dangerous,' he said, 'We're young.'
What to do?
'Ang Pasang, pass the radio please.' John and Sandy were sleeping in the
cook tent that night, by the radio, so I could call them at any time. I was
touched. The boys at base camp were doing the same.
I explained: 'John, Ang Pasang says we may not find our way. And there's
lightning. You have a view on that? '
'I don't know, Becs.'
This was desperate.
'The weather's going to get worse, not necessarily in the next two hours,
but it's going to build up. Whether it will hold off long enough I would not
like to say,' said John.
The discussion went round in circles: Camp 4 to Camp 2, Camp 2 to base camp,
back to Camp 4. 'Talk it over very gently with Ang Pasang and let him make
the final decision,' said John. 'It's his life too.'
We waited an hour. The wind did not pick up and the stars still crowded the
sky. And then I saw three lights making their way up the hill from the Col.
I do not know how the decision was finally made, but one thing was for sure:
if those three people thought there might even be the slightest chance of
making the summit, I could not go back to bed.
At 12.30am we were ready to go. 'Get on those fixed ropes,' said John, 'Get
on to the South Summit; reassess the situation there. And good luck. I think
you're going to be OK. Over.'
I heard him switch to base camp: 'The beauty of fixed rope,' he said, 'is
that you can't get lost. If the worse comes to the worse they can just turn
around and rattle down the ropes, back to the tent.'
I wonder if he would have been happy to let us go if he had known what we
were to discover? There were no fixed ropes. They must have been buried in
the snow.
There were just three of us now. Cheri Zhambu had a cough, and was forced to
turn back after climbing only a couple of hundred yards from the Col. It was
dark, very dark. And to add to the fun I had let my head torch batteries run
flat, as had Ang Pasang. Kami Cheri led, turning his head every few paces so
we could follow.
It was much steeper than I had imagined; icy in patches. In other places
rock lay camouflaged under the thinnest powdering of snow. I wondered at
times how the hell we were going to get down again.
But for the moment we were heading up, and, I thought, rather well. The
Sherpas, apparently, felt otherwise. It was about 4am, still dark. They sat
in the snow and refused to budge.
'What's the matter, guys?'
They were chatting away madly on the radio, in Nepali.
'Nawang says you've got two cold, scared Sherpas,' said John. Nawang was the
cook at Camp 2. Well, perhaps: thin cloud now engulfed us and there were no
longer stars visible in the sky.
'Maybe if you can persuade them to keep going until dawn, that might do the
trick,' said John.
Maybe. 'Look, Ang Pasang, let's just keep climbing until we catch up with
the three ahead. We can discuss it with them.'
I tried everything: 'Take my jacket' (I had a spare one). 'If you get to the
top? Of course you can come to London.'
There was a reluctance, but they - we  - moved on. We never did discuss the
matter with the three climbers ahead. We caught up with them, said our
hellos and climbed on past (they had no oxygen, so climbed slowly).
It was hard work; harder for the Sherpas than for me. I was on three litres
of oxygen per minute; they on one. That is a big difference. We would take
seven paces, maybe eight (ten was always beyond our reach) and rest for a
minute, another six, and rest again. And when the snow deepened, we took it
in turns kicking steps.
Up and up. The dawn broke and light snow blew in our faces from the east.
The whole of Tibet was one ominous snow cloud, and yet somewhere - somewhere
along the South East Ridge leading to the South Summit - the Sherpas'
attitude changed. They wanted that summit too.
I do not know why: I had read hundreds of books and talked to countless
people, and yet when I stood on the South Summit, the view along the final
ridge to the summit true, staggered me. Everything we had climbed thus far
was snow, or ice. This was rock, mostly: angular lumps falling away sharply
left and right.
'You can go first Kami Cheri,' I said.
'No, you can go.'
'No, you go.'
Kami Cheri led. It was not difficult by Alpine standards; perhaps a little.
But it was exposed. Best not look down. This was Hillary Step territory.
There were fixed ropes, in parts; but where there were not, one slip and it
would all be over.
I was happy when I left the rock behind for the broader snowy ridge, that
led to the summit. I knew it was the summit: it had lots of flags on top. It
was not very dramatic. But the joy on the Sherpas' faces made my heart near
burst. They grabbed the radio: 'Summit, summit, summit. We make summit.'
I suppose it is fear that forbids one to bask in such moments too long. The
cloud cleared for a moment to reveal a view across the Tibetan plateau that
stretched for miles: to China and Mongolia, no doubt. But I only glanced for
a second. It was cold, and the wind had picked up a little.
Going down was exhausting: I knew it would be. And dangerous. The five
people who had died this season, died here, descending from the summit to
the Col. I concentrated so hard; and the Sherpas were wonderful: 'Slowly,
slowly.' Kami Cheri led, while Ang Pasang paced himself just behind me.
It took about five hours down, and for an hour of that time the snow cloud
that had filled Tibet invaded our path and masked our vision almost
completely. But I felt calm, and when it cleared, there, far below, was a
small, red figure on the Col, excitedly waving his arms. It was Cheri
Zhambu.
A half hour later and he was unstrapping my crampons and rubbing my hands
warm because, casually, I had remarked that I was chilly. He boiled some
noodle soup, but I was not hungry. Gently, he insisted I should crawl into
my sleeping bag and rest; but I could not sleep.
It did not matter; nothing mattered that night. I was content. It was a
feeling I had never before experienced.

FT  19 JUN 93 / The Long View: Whales on the beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY YEARS ago I sat next to the boss of a now-forgotten mini-conglomerate
who explained his business strategy: annual earnings per share had to be 20
per cent. His profit and loss account was designed from the bottom up, and
enough deals had to be done to meet the target. As for the actual businesses
which happened to be in his group, well, organic growth was a minor matter.
More successful and durable conglomerates have not been run quite so
crudely, but the whole idea of the conglomerate - an opportunistic selection
of businesses under a corporate umbrella, fed with new acquisitions which
can be knocked into more efficient shape - has been a curious product of
Anglo-American stock market culture. There are plenty of diversified groups
in other countries too, but they are usually interlocking networks built by
banks or powerful families; they are rarely the creation of stock
market-oriented entrepreneurs.
The UK conglomerates reached a climax of frenzied dealing at the end of the
1980s, fuelled first by high share prices until the 1987 crash, and
subsequently by seemingly unlimited access to bank finance. Now, however,
they are withering, undermined by new accounting standards and priced out of
the takeover game by the high stock market ratings being given to smaller
companies.
Even Lord Hanson has been forced to climb down after serious institutional
opposition to some of his proposed changes to shareholder voting rights at
an extraordinary meeting next week. Meanwhile, his group's profits have
hardly grown since 1988. A bored Brian McGowan is retiring as chief
executive of Williams Holdings, because he cannot see any scope for exciting
acquisitions; the failure of its contested offer for Racal 18 months ago
seems to have marked a watershed. A rival conglomerate, Tomkins, is
struggling to maintain momentum after its takeover late last year of Ranks
Hovis McDougall, the flour mill and bakery group. The deal was always daft
in terms of industrial fit, and it is not clear whether it will now make
sense in terms of financial engineering.
Until only a few years ago the corporate finance departments of investment
banks prospered by arranging takeover deals for conglomerates - the more
contested and controversial, the bigger the fees. Now the investment bankers
are having to scratch around instead with breakups - such as the Zeneca
split from ICI and, across the Atlantic, this week's plan by Kodak to spin
off its Eastman chemicals division.
It has taken 25 years of expensive experience to persuade investors of the
hazards of takeovers. Over the years many academic studies have indicated
that there are few if any long-term benefits for shareholders, certainly not
for investors in the acquiring companies, which typically pay over the odds.
In their heyday, however, conglomerates carried a premium rating. It meant
they could issue paper on a high p/e ratio to buy companies on a low p/e
ratio. Earnings growth was self-sustaining until the ever-growing
accumulation of companies became unmanageable. The best conglomerates, such
as BTR and Hanson, avoided biting off more than they could chew, but size
was nonetheless a limiting factor.
Later, conglomerates exploited accountancy loopholes on an increasing scale
to create smooth earnings growth histories, contrasting with the ups and
downs of more specialised companies lowly ranked as 'cyclicals'. They
learned how to exploit pension fund surpluses. Finally, companies like
Hanson realised that UK institutional investors craved income growth, so a
healthy progression of dividends was created.
But the game is up. The tidal wave of accountancy manipulations in the late
1980s, leading to a number of unsignalled corporate collapses, forced the
accountants to clean up their act. The basic credibility of takeovers has
been undermined, now that investors accept that they cannot generate instant
returns. The Goode Committee, meanwhile, is considering how to tighten the
law governing pension funds.
The investment strategies of big institutional investors have changed in
important ways, too. Portfolios are managed much more on the basis of
specialised stock market sectors, with weightings carefully monitored and
controlled. Fund managers prefer to invest in focused companies - ICI in
chemicals, for instance, and Zeneca in health and household - rather than in
conglomerates that straddle awkwardly across several sectors.
For a surprisingly long time, fund managers seemed to be prepared to
subcontract their industrial diversification strategy to conglomerate
bosses. But that has all changed. Today the average Footsie 100 company
sells on a p/e ratio of 21 times 1992 earnings, and the average small
company p/e is more like 30.
This leaves the conglomerates, which on average have a p/e of 15, beached
like whales. Their geographical orientation is also a problem. Outside the
UK they have only found it possible to pursue takeover strategies in the US,
whereas British fund managers at present tend to seek exposure to
Continental Europe and the Far East.
These value relationships reflect the peculiar circumstances of the early
stages of an economic recovery. For most of this year so far, the
once-despised cyclicals have been in great demand and investors have shown
little interest in conglomerates with their artificially-smoothed profit
trends. It is possible, however, that the valuations now being placed on
small companies may prove over-ambitious. It depends on whether the
managements, and the economy, deliver.
Conglomerate bosses will argue that only inefficient managements will gain
from the disappearance of the predators. But after several years of
recession there are too many thin companies around and not enough fat ones.
The hunters must make way for the growers.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Anger as Irish president meets Sinn Fein chief: UK
government concerned over Belfast visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent, and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MEETING yesterday be-tween Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, and Mr
Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
provoked scarcely disguised fury in Downing Street.
The brief, private meeting took place at a college assembly hall in west
Belfast, where Mr Adams, among 70 representatives of the area, held out his
hand and greeted Mrs Robinson in Irish.
Just hours later the Northern Ireland Office said the Irish president was
not in the province at the government's invitation. She was there in a
private capacity.
'The UK government took steps to make clear that its concern about aspects
of the visit - including its planning  - were made known at the highest
level in the Irish government,' it said in a statement.
Outraged protests by Unionist politicians underlined the added difficulties
now facing Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in seeking to
persuade the Unionists to take part in further talks on new democratic
structures for the province.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called on
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to make an official protest to Dublin
about the 'behaviour' of the Irish head of state.
He accused her of acting as if she were the head of state of Northern
Ireland and giving 'a propaganda boost to the IRA'.
While refraining from public comment, Downing Street emphasised that the
British government's only role had been to ensure adequate security for Mrs
Robinson during the meeting.
Another source of irritation was that Mrs Robinson chose to meet Mr Adams
within 48 hours of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, being told
at a meeting with Mr Major in London about the efforts being made to
persuade the Ulster Unionists to take part in fresh talks.
Mr Adams maintained that British politicians had tried to sabotage the Irish
president's two-day visit to the province. He claimed that both the British
and Irish governments must have seen and approved the guest list.
Mrs Robinson said after the meeting that west Belfast had shown her 'the
strength, the vitality, the energy and the commitment and the dedication of
their community.
'Nobody was hogtying or trying to make a political meeting out of it.'
Her action was defended by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland
secretary. He said: 'Mrs Robinson was on a private visit to west Belfast
where she met a resident of west Belfast.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Heseltine challenges Nadir to substantiate 'smears'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS POLITICAL EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday challenged fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir to
substantiate his allegations about the role of ministers and the
Conservative party in the demise of Polly Peck International.
In a move strongly endorsed by Mr John Major's office, Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, said that Mr Nadir should either end the
'smears' or back them up. In a direct message to Mr Nadir, he said: 'Don't
let's get involved in allegations. Publish it. Stop smears. Publish what you
believe to be evidence.'
Amid a swirl of speculation at Westminster about the possible links of past
or present ministers with Mr Nadir there was private acknowledgment that the
constant flow of allegations was damaging the government.
One government minister suggested a thorough overhaul by Conservative
Central Office of its fundraising procedures to tighten the rules on
acceptance of company donations and to ensure greater transparency in the
party's accounts.
He said: 'Accepting the money from Nadir was an understandable mistake given
his good reputation at the time. But some of the mud is bound to stick. We
should not allow it to happen again.' The party has, so far, refused to
repay the Pounds 440,000 donated during the 1980s by Mr Nadir's companies.
Ministers also criticised the role of the media in publishing
unsubstantiated allegations made by a fugitive from the British courts.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on Mr Major to intervene directly
in the 'scandal' of Tory party financing. He said the prime minister was
legally responsible for the Conservative party organisation.
At the same time, as head of government, it was his responsibility to close
loopholes in the Companies Act which had allowed the Tory party to accept
loans rather than gifts and thus avoid the existing disclosure rules.
Mr Smith said that the practice - proposed but then quickly abandoned by the
Conservatives last year - was a 'disgrace'.
Senior Tory officials flatly rejected the notion that the party should be
responsible for compliance by corporate donors with the legal requirement on
companies to include political donations in published accounts.
The Northern Ireland minister, Mr Michael Mates, whose gift of a watch to Mr
Nadir was described by the prime minister as a 'misjudgement', yesterday
issued a statement denying claims that he had received the gift of a car on
behalf of his wife, Rosellen.
In the statement to the Press Association news agency, he said: 'It has been
put to me by some journalists that I have received on behalf of my wife the
gift of a car, with improper motives being adduced.
'I wish to categorically deny that anybody connected with me has received
any such gift or that I have done anything in any way improper in this
connection.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Bottomley orders study of top-level ethics rules at NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETHICAL RULES at the top of the National Health Service, Europe's largest
civilian employer, are to be fundamentally re-examined.
The move, announced yesterday by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
is a response to financial scandals and concern over the adequacy of
non-executive directors' powers.
Addressing the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts
conference in Bournemouth, Mrs Bottomley said a task force would be set up
to 'spearhead an urgent review of the current guidance on corporate
governance'.
Her speech twice noted the importance of placing 'strong emphasis on the
traditional public-service values of open-ness, probity and
account-ability'.
The immediate catalyst for action - referred to only obliquely by Mrs
Bottomley - is a series of severely critical reports by district auditors,
pointing to waste of at least Pounds 10m in the West Midlands regional
health authority and Pounds 20m in Wessex. Police have investigated in both
regions. Four people are awaiting trial in Wessex and the House of Commons
public accounts committee is also conducting an inquiry.
More broadly, the 1991 NHS reforms devolved financial and other
decision-making to hundreds of trusts and district health authority boards.
That has raised questions about the relationship between full-time managers
and part-time non-executive board members.
Questions Mrs Bottomley wants considered include:
Giving non-executive directors power to seek independent financial and other
advice and direct access to independent audit reports;
Appointing audit committees of non-executive directors;
Creating a company secretary role in health authorities and trust hospitals;
and
Maintaining a register of directors' business interests and adopting a code
of ethics.
Mrs Bottomley said there was a need to look again at the way health
authority and hospital chairmen and non-executive directors were appointed,
to ensure that the NHS was picking the best people. She has joined regional
health authority chairmen in meeting Sir Adrian Cadbury to discuss lessons
for the NHS from his 1992 report on corporate governance in the private
sector.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, who also addressed the
conference, said he suspected that fraud and corruption in the NHS were much
less widespread than a few cases might suggest.

FT  19 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas's fond hope that its dividend would be covered by earnings this year
has surely perished in the continental car market pile-up. The company may
justifiably claim that conditions have deteriorated at a rate no-one had
predicted. Nevertheless, the UK had been in recession for well over two
years before Lucas announced substantial cost reductions last October. It is
hard to avoid the impression that Lucas waited for the market to rescue it,
only to respond with too little action too late.
Further cuts will be needed, including presumably in the dividend. Yet a
full-blooded approach may have to wait for a new chief executive.
Unfortunately, that appointment is taking so long that such a hot seat now
looks difficult to fill. Lucas's share price has been buoyed this year by
hopes of a bid from BTR. Its recent sag, however, suggests a recovery stock
which has simply failed to recover.

FT  19 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the world's main financial markets, Japan is traditionally the least
affected by political uncertainty. That seems to have changed after the
troubles of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa prompted the dissolution of the Diet. For a
time, at least, the markets will have to live with a degree of uncertainty
that extends to the question of whether the Liberal Democratic party can
survive intact. That implies renewed strain for the equity market which even
official support buying may be unable to offset. The yen also weakened
sharply yesterday, though that could be a more transitory response.
The Nikkei has already fallen more than 1,000 points from its 1993 peak on
fears that the stronger yen would damp Japan's modest economic recovery
prospects. Palliatives, such as a large discount rate cut or further fiscal
stimulation, now seem remote given the political vacuum. The election
campaign may produce promises of tax cuts which would boost consumption.
Whether the poll will produce a government capable of delivering them
quickly is another matter.
Similarly, there seems less chance of a bilateral trade agreement with the
US, which might reverse the yen's recent rise. This could thus resume after
the initial political shock has worn off. The yen may be saved further
upward pressure if the dollar's jump against the D-Mark yesterday means the
US currency has found new strength. Otherwise next month's Tokyo summit
could be dominated by spats over the exchange market instead of co-ordinated
measures to revive world growth.

If the art of politics is timing, Mr Kenneth Clarke's arrival at No 11
Downing Street has been a masterpiece. The new chancellor has been greeted
by a slew of economic data promising modest growth without a resurgence of
inflation. The retail price and employment figures are cases in point. That
is music to the ears of financial markets: the FT-SE 100 index is again
pushing 2,900 and long-dated gilt yields have trickled down towards 8 per
cent. Since the corporate news has been mixed it may be that gilts are
setting the pace.
Equities certainly look more comfortable on a historic yield of 4 per cent
after the rally at the long end of the gilts market. If the optimistic mood
in that market is sustained, the FT-SE 100 could rise to 3,000 without
stretching the yield ratio much beyond 2 times. That might give the equity
market more chance of breaking out of the trading range which has prevailed
since March. Whether gilts will remain a help remains an open question. The
Bank of England has cautioned that inflationary pressures could resurface in
the autumn, in which case the gilts market would doubtless demand more of a
risk premium for funding the government's borrowing requirement.
In those circumstances, Mr Clarke will need more than political nous to keep
the markets on side. The Mansion House speech was predictably vague about
the extent to which fiscal tightening might be needed to control borrowing.
The odds are that something more will be required of the autumn budget.

The Treasury's zeal in adopting the cause of orderly and transparent markets
in London is indeed admirable. It would be all the more so if it had been
much in evidence before the government had Pounds 5bn-worth of BT shares to
unload. In that context, official protestations that attempts to limit short
selling ahead of the BT3 issue are to defend the reputation of London as a
capital-raising centre ring like a cracked champagne glass. Both the
Treasury and the Stock Exchange say they are concerned to prevent a re-run
of the substantial price drop ahead of the Wellcome float in the BT3 offer.
If that is the case, they have had almost a year to consult and introduce
general reforms which would have defined rules acceptable to all market
participants. Instead the Treasury's special pleading is letting its naked
self-interest show.
The Stock Exchange's tattered credibility has been further damaged. It was
minded to grant SG Warburg's request for a move to cash settlement until
institutional pressure intervened. Now it is to monitor all large BT
transactions over the next few weeks. Yet, if this was considered necessary,
why was it not announced at the start of the flotation? The delay has made
the Exchange appear in thrall to one of its large market makers - a prospect
far more damaging to London's reputation than jiggery-pokery by institutions
trying to buy cheap stock.
Book-building and incentives techniques have run well ahead of the SIB's
rules on stabilisation of new issues. Indeed, there is no consensus on what
would constitute a false market in BT shares. The Stock Exchange is vague on
what actions would be considered market manipulation ahead of such a large
flotation. It is at least possible that the incentives offered by Warburg
create a false impression of the value of BT shares under current
conditions. The Treasury, the SIB and the Stock Exchange need to resolve
such questions in a way which does not imply that they are making policy on
the hoof. It would also help if they could do it under conditions where the
conflicts of interest are not so glaring.

FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Selling pressure moves to
drug stocks
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A SELL-OFF in drug stocks left Wall Street in the doldrums yesterday
afternoon, with volume bloated by the afternoon's triple-witching expiration
of options and futures on stock indices, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled to post gains briefly in the
afternoon after a depressed morning but it was hit by triple-witching
related selling which contributed to a drop of 27.12 to 3,494.77. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.86 at 443.68, while the Amex
composite was 0.57 lower at 436.82 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.35 to
689.59.
Triple witching trading swelled volume on the NYSE. More than 294m shares
changed hands on the day, with turnover of more than 120m shares by 11am.
Declines outnumbered rises by 1,217 to 691.
Investor confidence in drug stocks was shaken by a number of ratings
downgrades yesterday morning. Kidder Peabody cut its investment rating on
Merck, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the respective stocks dropped
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37, Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 , and Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 59 5/8 . Shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson, which was downgraded by
Harris Upham, fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 .
Litton Industries shares soared Dollars 8 1/8 to record high of Dollars 65
1/8 in very heavy trading after the company said that it would establish an
independent commercial company which will include Litton's oil field
information services and industrial automation units. Litton Industries will
remain an aerospace and defense company. The tax-free transaction is
expected to be completed by the end of this year.
Airline stocks turned higher after taking a beating earlier this week. AMR,
parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 62 1/2 after dropping
Dollars 4 1/2 a day earlier when the company said that its second quarter
earnings would be significantly below analysts expectations.
USAir, which issued its own profits warning on Wednesday, regained Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 16 1/4 , and UAL, parent of United, firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 122 5/8 , but Delta edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 48. The
sector's improvement contributed to gains in the Dow Jones Transportation
Average, which was up 3.78 to 1,495.30
On the Nasdaq market, technology issues moved broadly lower with Microsoft
down Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 87 1/2 , Apple Computer off Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 41. Lotus Development held steady at Dollars 35.
Integrated Circuit Systems, which designs and manufactures integrated
circuits, plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 after Prudential
Securities cut its rating on the stock to 'hold' from 'buy'.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended little changed in active trading. Based on
preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was up 3.23 points at 3,906.94, for a
gain on the week of about 41 points.
Advances led declines 391 to 323. Volume of 66.72m shares was above
Thursday's 61.64m shares. Trading value rose to CDollars 912m from CDollars
639m.

FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo weaker ahead of no
confidence vote

MOUNTING uncertainty over the political situation pushed investors on to the
sidelines, and the Nikkei average posted moderate losses on the growing
likelihood that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, would dissolve the
lower house for a general election, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 120.97 to 19,804.54 after volatile moves between a high of
19,913.96 at the opening and a low of 19,678.14 in the afternoon. A sharp
fall in the futures contract in Singapore triggered arbitrage unwinding,
while public funds and investment trusts supported share prices above the
19,600 level.
Volume fell to a three-month low of 250m shares against 313m. Declines led
advances by 605 to 387 with 164 unchanged, and the Topix index of all
first-section stocks fell for the fifth consecutive day, losing 6.27 to
1,587.32. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.35 to 1,202.53.
The yen continued to weaken on political fears. The dollar closed Y0.40
higher at Y107.40, and prompted profit taking by foreigners.
Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities predicted that the Nikkei would
fluctuate within a narrow range next week, with the bottom at 19,300. 'The
political situation has been discounted into prices, and unless something
drastic happens, the index will find support,' he added.
Banks were lower on Topix-linked, arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y30 to Y2,890 and Sakura Bank fell Y40 to Y1,560.
Heavy electricals lost ground with Hitachi down Y12 to Y827, but consumer
electronics groups were firmer with Sony up Y50 at Y4,360.
In Osaka, the OSE average posted its fifth straight fall, declining 34.97 to
21,954.09 in volume of 16.4m shares.
Roundup
POLITICAL initiatives, bargain hunting and a buying spree in Bangkok
combined to give the region a positive bias.
HONG KONG saw late profit-taking which pared gains after Britain and China
agreed on the franchise for the projected airport's West Harbour Crossing
tunnel project.
The Hang Seng index closed 11.65 higher at 7,200.75, 0.9 per cent down on
the week, after an early fall of some 85 points, and an afternoon gain of 49
points. Turnover rose from HK4.7bn to HKDollars 4.8bn.
The afternoon profit-taking halted rebounds by the airport contractors,
Hutchison, which ended down 40 cents at HKDollars 21.20, and Swire Pacific
A, down 25 cents at HKDollars 39.75.
BANGKOK climbed as foreign institutions joined local investors, Taiwanese
and Hong Kong Chinese in a buying spree, brokers said.
Turnover rose by Bt3bn to Bt12.2bn, its highest since January 13, as the SET
index rose 8.18 to 888.84, 4.2 per cent higher on the week.
MANILA was lifted by government assurances that the country's severe power
crisis will ease by December and the composite index rose 1.56 to 1,577.86,
barely changed on the week.
The mining sector was strong, while Manila Electric's B shares improved 2
pesos to 207 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered some of the week's losses on bargain hunting, the
composite index rising 14.79 to 735.25, down 1.5 per cent on the week.
Volume was 342.2m shares against Thursday's 299.8m.
Granite Industries put on MDollars 1.00 to MDollars 8.75 on rumours that it
had won a timber concession in China.
BOMBAY closed slightly lower after a sudden reversal in the last 20 minutes
of trade on reports that India's main opposition party was pushing hard for
the resignation of the prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, after
allegations by the stockbroker involved in a Dollars 1.28bn securities
scandal. The BSE index lost 19.43 to 2,214.95.
JAKARTA closed at a new high for the year, the index gaining 0.71 to 355.64.

FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Dublin digests gains on punt's
devaluation - Forecasts are being upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having gulped down the government's remaining stakes in Greencore and Irish
Life over the past two months, the Irish market is busily digesting those
stocks, and consolidating its 30 per cent gain in the year to date.
Mortgage rates are now hitting historic lows in the republic, and interest
rates generally are expected to fall by a further percentage point or two by
the end of the year, causing most market analysts in Dublin to make further
revisions to their forecasts.
Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy stockbrokers, says: 'We are
strategically very bullish and dropping our short-term caveats. We have
upgraded earnings estimates for this year and next, and my instinct for the
first time in several years is that we now have them too low rather than too
high.'
He forecasts earnings growth for the market of 14 per cent this year and 17
per cent in 1994, and expects the ISEQ index to reach 1,750 by the year end.
It closed yesterday at 1.580.39.
He says that the fall in interest rates since last January's devaluation of
the punt has been much quicker than expected, and that wholesale rates will
probably now fall to 6 per cent by early 1994.
Mr John Conroy, head of research at NCB stockbrokers, believes that activity
will probably remain quiet over the summer: 'Net cash inflows into
institutions remain anaemic.
'The interest rate falls still have to filter through to the individual
saver; but by the second half of the year mutual and unit-linked products
will again begin to look attractive alternatives to cash deposits.'
With more liquidity in the market and a benign outlook for strong earnings
growth, upturns in the US and UK markets, where a number of the Irish
companies have significant business, and the continuing downward pressure on
interest rates, he is also predicting a substantial upside for Irish stocks.
'Interest rate-sensitive stocks, such as the banks and CRH, should continue
to perform well, while the food companies are also coming into favour.'
Jefferson Smurfit, which has been the one big disappointment in the market
this year, lagging behind the other industrials, and which has a significant
weighting in the ISEQ index, should also firm up, he says, as 'institutions
will be reluctant to go any further underweight'.
Mr Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, points out that
there has been a 27 per cent growth in money supply in the republic over the
past year, 'so that there is now a lot of liquidity in the system'.
This should have the dual effect of boosting consumer spending, improving
the earnings prospects of companies trading in the domestic market, and, as
interest rates fall, encouraging greater investment in equities.
This should reverse the 1992 trend which saw funds move into cash, and which
proved to be a big technical problem for Irish stocks last year. 'Cash is
beginning to look uncompetitive,' says Mr McLaughlin.
He notes that foreign investment in the market has been the main catalyst
for the growth this year, and he estimates that between IPounds 350-400m
(Dollars 530-Dollars 670m) has come into the market this year from non-Irish
institutions, allowing domestic institutions to meet encashment commitments
without drying up liquidity.
Traditionally around 80 per cent of Irish stocks have been held by Irish
institutions and, although that balance will not have been significantly
altered by the recent surge in foreign interest - total market
capitalisation is some IPounds 10.5bn - 'it is, nonetheless, a healthy
development', says Mr Conroy.
The progressive lifting of exchange controls over the past couple of years -
they were lifted in their entirety last January - had been identified by
analysts as a serious technical problem for the market, as Irish
institutions began to rebalance their portfolios by shifting a large
proportion of their funds into overseas equities and gilts. That concern now
appears largely to have passed.
Meanwhile, a further source of liquidity is in the pipeline in the form of a
proposed tax amnesty, which, it is hoped, will result in a substantial
repatriation of previously-undeclared funds held overseas, estimated at
IPounds 2bn. Most analysts believe that around IPounds 500m could be
repatriated, of which about a half is likely to be invested in equities and
property. The government wants to have the amnesty completed by the autumn.
On the supply side, most of the big Irish stocks have strong balance sheets
with good cash flows, and so any new rights issues are likely to be
expansion-orientated, analysts say. Only some IPounds 200m was raised in the
market last year, down from some IPounds 700m a year in the late 1980s.
The coalition government has no plans for further privatisations following
the sell-off of its remaining stakes in Greencore and Irish Life, and the
only big newcomer envisaged for the market is the Irish Permanent Building
Society; but that flotation is not now expected until 1994.

FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Promise of lower interest
rates helps bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROMISE of lower interest rates, and higher bond markets had varied
effects on the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID closed sharply higher, boosted by the Bank of Spain's cut in its
daily rate on liquidity injections to the market. The general index rose
3.73 to 264.77, up 2.7 per cent on the week.
The Bank of Spain's move to cut its average daily rate by 22 basis points to
11.52 per cent was seen as clearing the way for a cut in its official
benchmark rate of 11.25 per cent.
Mr Stephen Hughes at Kleinwort Benson added that there was a political
angle, in that discussions between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the victorious
Socialist prime minister, and the CiU, the Catalan nationalist party, seemed
to hold out the prospect of stable government.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks moved, with gains in banks and most
utilities. Big blue chips reflected the more general bullishness, with
Repsol Pta70 higher at Pta3,335 and Telefonica up Pta40 at Pta1,435.
FRANKFURT saw a huge increase in turnover as DTB options expired, but little
share price volatility as the DAX index closed 5.39 lower at 1,686.90, a
fraction higher on the week.
Turnover virtually trebled to DM15.4bn with Allianz, Siemens, Daimler and
Deutsche Bank accounting for over DM6bn between them.
Banks mostly ignored gains in the fixed interest market, where the
Bundesbank's average bond yield fell three basis points to 6.57 per cent and
looked to be extending that trend in the afternoon. Deutsche Bank lost
DM5.50 to DM692 and Dresdner DM3.20 to DM378.50.
On the upside, news of lower taxes on German trucks left MAN DM3.50 higher
at DM272.50.
Among second and third-liners, Viag's Gerresheimer Glas subsidiary fell
DM4.50 to DM214 on a first-half loss, and widening losses at Technocell, the
technical paper group, took its shares down DM20 to DM237.
PARIS built on Thursday's gains, helped by a stronger bond market, and
expectations of a further 25 basis point cut in interest rates on Monday.
The CAC-40 index settled up 9.98 at 1,910.29, slightly lower on the week.
Turnover was put at FFr2.6bn.
Investors continued to react to profit warnings from Havas and St Gobain and
the shares slipped respectively by FFr2.00 and FFr1.50 to FFr412.10 and
FFr475.20.
LVMH advanced FFr13 to FFr3,729 following a presentation in London on
Thursday and positive brokers' reports released this week.
Credit Local de France featured with a FFr8 rise to FFr407 after the
government set the sale price of 10.9m shares being offered to the public at
FFr386.
MILAN continued to be supported by Ferruzzi group companies, which have
begun to recover some of the losses of the last couple of weeks. The Comit
index closed 6.01 higher at 527.97, down 0.7 per cent on the week. The
market's rise was also helped by strength in Fiat, which climbed L258 to
L5,978 at the close and to L6,120 on the kerb.
There have been suggestions that the restructuring of Ferruzzi might lead to
a delay in the privatisation schedule, particularly as Credito Italiano and
BCI - two of the Ferruzzi creditor banks - are among leading candidates for
flotation.
However, Mr William Cowan, an analyst with James Capel in London, commented
that while, in the short term, the privatisation of Credito would probably
be held up, he did not see the process as a whole getting under way until
some time in 1994. This was because of the continuing political uncertainty
 -elections may be held in the autumn  - and the packed legislative
programme, he said.
Ferruzzi gained L90.70 or 16 per cent to L635.50, a loss of 13 per cent on
the week and Montedison improved L93 to L939, 3.7 per cent lower on the
week.
Among the banks, BCI put on L63 to L5,143 and Credito L23 to L2,701;
Mediobanca rose L640 to L15,840, then to L16,200 on the kerb.
AMSTERDAM was given a boost by the strength of the dollar. The expiry of
June options and futures had little negative impact. The CBS Tendency index
closed 0.3 higher at 109.2, an improvement of 1.9 per cent on the week.
Royal Dutch struck an all time high, up Fl 2.00 to Fl 175.70, helped by
strong overnight US buying.
Among other multinationals, Unilever gained Fl 1.10 to Fl 198.50.
STOCKHOLM fell back in spite of a 1.6 per cent gain in Ericsson, up SKr5 to
SKr319, after winning further new orders. The Affarsvarlden general index
lost 3.00 to 1,078.90.
ISTANBUL leapt by 5.4 per cent to its seventh record close of the month,
cash continuing to flow into the market on political and economic optimism,
as well as bright six-month profit expectations.
The market index closed 538.83 higher at a provisional 10,460.80, up 18.4
per cent on the week on hopes that Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister,
will pursue low interest rate policies, speed up privatisation and give more
incentives to stock trading through equity-based mutual funds.

FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures expiry overshadows trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY arbitrage dealing between stock index contracts and the underlying
blue chips provided the backcloth yesterday to the close of the two-week
trading account in the UK stock market. The first half of the session
featured the expiry of the June contract on the FT-SE Index and of June
Share Index options.
The September contract on the Footsie then took over the lead, moving to a
strong premium against the underlying cash market. Both futures and equities
appeared to run out of steam towards the close, however, and traders said
the second half of the day had been less exciting. At the day's best, the
Footsie touched 2,887.6, confidently challenging the higher reaches of its
trading range. But this level was reached in the wake of the settlement in
stock index futures, when the market was distorted by heavy basket trading
by the big investment houses; basket trades involve balancing large deals in
the stock index future with a basket of the underlying blue chips.
The market remained firm throughout the day although progress became more
erratic. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,879.4, for a net gain on
the day of 3.7 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 2.3 to a new peak of
3,215.8. Over the two-week account, the FT-SE 100 Index has added 1.7 per
cent and the Mid 250 1.3 per cent.
Strategists said that equities were helped by the generally very favourable
reception for UK unemployment and inflation statistics released on the
previous day. These were seen as convincing evidence that the recovery in
the domestic economy is being sustained.
Strong demand for the September futures contract on the Footsie from a
leading Japanese house provided support for confidence in the outlook for UK
equities. Seaq trading volume jumped to 712.5m shares, but was distorted to
some extent by the index basket trading; non-Footsie business dipped to
around 56 per cent of the total. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 555.4m shares
was worth Pounds 1.36bn at retail level, continuing the recent improvement
in customer activity in equities.
Government bonds firmed up behind a steady performance by sterling,
conventional gilts gaining at the longer end of the range. Index-linked
government bonds, their attractions less visible as the latest data
indicates that inflation remains subdued, held steady.

FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs underperform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drugs sector made modest progress but nevertheless continued to
underperform the wider market amid suggestions that at least one big US
broking house, rumoured to be Kidder Peabody, had downgraded the
pharmaceuticals sector.
These rumours offset news earlier in the session that the Clinton
administration in the US has postponed its healthcare reforms.
Another bull point for the sector was the market's confidence that Zeneca's
Pounds 1.3bn rights issue had coasted home, despite persistent talk in the
financial press that the issue would encounter substantial difficulties and
had failed to attract sufficient overseas support. Zeneca's rights close on
Monday.
Zeneca 'old' closed a penny harder at 622p on hefty turnover of 4.2m shares,
while the 'new' shares, quoted in fully-paid form, were the same price. ICI
held at 697p.
Fisons, which drops out of the FT-SE 100 index on Monday, nevertheless
proved the best performer in that index over the week. Although 3 1/2 easier
yesterday at 171 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 4.2m shares, the stock was still
16 1/2 higher over the five-day period, reflecting a mixture of takeover
speculation and the official US launch of its anti-asthma drug Tilade.
TSB shares continued to bump up against their all-time high, reached on
Monday, before closing a net 1 1/2 better at 195p. The bank is scheduled to
reveal interim results on Thursday with pre-tax profits expected to come in
at around the Pounds 75m, compared with a Pounds 92m and the market set to
focus on the level of bad debts.
The water stocks included in the FT-SE 100 list, big winners in mid-week
when a number of institutions were said to have been aggressive buyers, fell
sharply following a sustained bout of profit-taking.
Severn Trent, which goes ex-dividend on Monday, fell 13 to 470p after
exceptionally heavy trading of 4.6m. North West lost 10 to 457p and Anglian
9 to 360 1/2 p. Thames eased 7 to 459p.
Dealers reported substantial switching out of the electricity stocks
('recs') and into the Scottish generators, where Hydro featured with a 5
rise to 344p. Scottish Power hardened to 322p on 4.2m traded.
Southern Electricity dropped 11 1/2 to 455 1/2 p, South Wales 10 to 536p and
Midland 8 to 463p.
BT came in for sustained buying interest, the shares closing 5 higher at
428p; the BT3 marketing effort moved into overdrive at the start of the
week. A bear squeeze drove Cable &amp; Wireless up 9 to 748p.
Blick, the electronics group, plunged 43 to 455p after press comment on the
company's accounting procedures. Advisors to Blick insisted, however, that
the changes were in accounting presentation, not accounting policy. Beales
Hunter was another big casualty in the electricals area of the market, the
shares sliding 27 to 265p, after 262p, following the profits warning.
Shares in Asda, the food retailer, saw the largest volume of trading with
some 27.5m changing hands, with an American buyer thought to have bought a
block of 6m traded at 75p. The stock closed up 1 1/2 p at 74p.
The sector also saw business in Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate, said to
be the focus of some big switching activity with a block of 5m shares traded
at 592p, the eventual closing price and 3 better on the day.
Leading discount food retailer Kwik Save ended its last day in the FTSE 100
index 8 down at 713p, against a background of worries on how the group is
coping in an increasingly tough discount sector.
Brewers looked a lively sector in comparison, with some dealers selling
Guinness, following a presentation by LVMH, the French luxury goods
manufacturer with which the brewer and distiller has a 24 per cent
cross-holding.
Analysts interpreted part of the information as negative about some of the
groups' important markets. The shares closed 11 down at 484p.
Grand Met was the beneficiary of Guinness' misfortune, picking up 7 to close
at 414p.
In food manufacturing, a slow day revived rumours of a bid for United
Biscuits, where the shares closed up 5 at 400p.
The market appreciated reports that British Aerospace is to implement a
reorganisation of its businesses, a move likely to improve its dividends
paying capacity. The shares rose 12 to 413p after trade of 5.2m.
Nervous trading in British Steel ahead of figures on Monday saw the shares
give up 3 1/2 to 98 1/2 p, with US selling, mostly in the final hour of the
session, prompting the slide. Analysts expect the company to report a loss
of Pounds 150 million.
Williams Holdings were favoured by several securities houses, including
Charterhouse Tilney. The shares put on 9 to 318p. Glynwed International
finished 3 ahead at 305p. Carr Kitcat however remained cautious and cut
current year profit expectations by 3.5 million to Pounds 39 million. The
same house weighed in with a savage profit downgraded for APV, reducing the
current year figure by Pounds 9 million to Pounds 14 million. The shares
firmed 1 1/2 to 101.5p. Bid target Securiguard added 8 to 309p amid talk
that its predator Rentokil Group, 3 up at 188p, would soon raise its offer.

FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners attracts support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGENCY brokers traded 19.6m shares in the heavily indebted Ratners Group
yesterday, making the stock the third most active in Friday's quiet market.
Analysts said rumours that the company would soon announce the results of
renegotiations for its banking facilities, as well as sales slightly higher,
lay behind the activity, which comes ahead of next Monday's new trading
account.
Ratners, now in its closed period, refused to comment and said any figures
that looked likely to surprise the market would be shown to the Stock
Exchange.
The shares closed up 2 1/4 at 35 3/4 p. The rally follows heavy trading
earlier in the month.

FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPIRY of the June series in both the FT-SE futures and the traded
options provided the main spur for trade in the derivatives sector, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100, having opened at 2884,
squeezed forward to 2890 before mid-morning expiry at 2882 on volume of
3,439 lots.
The September contract then took over as the near month contract and having
opened at 2,904, traded at a strong premium to cash for the rest of the
session, with heavy arbitrage between the September contract and cash.
Nomura International bought the contract aggressively but enthusiasm eased
later and September finished at 2,905, 10 above estimated fair value of 15.
Volume was 8269.
In traded options, June index options expired, but total volume at 22,477
was below recent levels. Some 9,070 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and 2,005 in the Euro-FT-SE. Sears was the most active option with a total
of 1,963 contracts.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates descend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH cash rates fell sharply yesterday as the D-Mark's weakness on the
currency markets raised speculation that the Bank of France would ease
policy on Monday, writes James Blitz.
France's short term rates have been below Germany's for several weeks, as
dealers seek a premium to compensate for the growing economic and budgetary
problems in Germany.
The French franc yesterday pierced the FFr3.36 level against the German
currency in European trading, and dealers believe that French rates could go
even lower.
France's 3-month money yesterday fell to 7.07 per cent on the bid side, a
drop of 8 basis points on the day.
German 3-month money also dropped some 15 basis points from 7.45 per cent to
around 7.32 per cent at the end of the day. One reason for this was a very
good figure for the German producer price index in May, showing a drop of
0.2 per cent on the month.
As inflationary pressures ease, the chance of another cut in short-term
German interest rates increases, and there are already expectations of a
repo rate cut on Wednesday.
The spread between French and German 3 month money was around 25 basis
points yesterday. But it was striking how interest rate futures dealers
believed this could widen.
The September French franc contract rose some 12 basis points yesterday to
close at 93.62. This brought the spread between September French and German
contracts to some 30 basis points.
In sterling markets, the overwhelming view appears to be that recent
economic data have made another cut in UK base rates very unlikely this
year.
The September short sterling interest rate contract dropped 2 basis points
to close at 94.09, bringing it in line with 3 month money, which was more or
less unchanged at 5 27/32 per cent. The Bank of England dealt with a Pounds
1.55bn shortage in a very helpful way.
A few dealers wondered whether the government might not be tempted into a
rate cut now. Inflation is at a 29-year low, the pound was yesterday testing
DM2.52, European rate cutting seems imminent and Mr John Major needs a
political boost.
But with a new governor of the Bank of England about to take office, the
authorities may keep their powder dry for the time being.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Long-awaited dollar move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR broke through the critical DM1.67 level against the D-Mark
yesterday, touching a 15-month high against the German currency, and looking
well set for a strategic move upwards, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's move in the dollar was the most important event in the currency
markets this year. The dollar has been trapped in a range of DM1.56 to
DM1.67 over the last six months, and has made several attempts to breach the
DM1.67 level.
There was a strong feeling among analysts yesterday that the dollar could
now hit DM1.72 or even DM1.80 in the near term, after closing in London at
DM1.6800, some 2 1/2 pfennigs up on the day.
The currency's move came against the background of a weak D-Mark, which
dropped in value against most European currencies amid concern over the
deteriorating state of the German economy and the budget deficit.
However, the market may have been moved by comments from officials in the US
and Germany which suggested that the interest rate differential between both
countries is set to narrow, placing higher value on dollar investments.
Mr Horst Schulmann, a Bundesbank council member, said on Thursday night that
German inflation was easing, and that the Bundesbank could continue its rate
cutting policy. Two Federal Reserve governors were also reported to have
made hawkish noises on US inflation.
Sentiment towards the dollar was very strong, but Mr Steve Hannah, an
economist at IBJ International, said that the dollar could come down again
if the outlook on interest rates changed. Yesterday's move also appeared to
have been backed by modest volumes. 'Some of our dealers would like to have
seen bigger flows,' said one London-based analyst.
Yesterday's move in dollar/D-Mark added muscle to the extraordinary reversal
in the yen following the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as Japanese prime
minister.
After opening in London at about Y107.60 to the dollar, the yen yesterday
tumbled nearly 2 per cent in value to a low of Y109.47 and remained at those
levels at the European close. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist
at Citibank, believes that this is a short-term reversal and that the
upheaval in Japanese politics could even be seen in a positive light.
The D-Mark was beleaguered in Europe, falling to minus 29 on its divergence
indicator in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The French franc traded
below FFr3.36 to the D-Mark while sterling closed 1/4 pfennig higher at
DM2.5125.

FRENCH pharmaceutical goods distributor and manufacturer Cooperation
Pharmaceutique Francaise and distributor Bergen Brunswick of the US have
dropped their bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique (OCP), Paris Bourse
authorities announced, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
The move appears to leave the field to the counterbid by Germany's Gehe,
which offered FFr985 a share (ex-dividend) for the group, substantially more
than the FFr865 with dividend offered by Cooper and Bergen Brunswick.
Gehe, a distributor and generic drug maker, intends to merge its
distribution activities with OCP's, creating a French-registered company
with FFr50bn of annual revenues.
Gehe's bid closes on July 9.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Litton Industries spins off arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LITTON Industries yesterday joined the trend for US companies to spin-off
large subsidiaries as separately quoted businesses when it announced plans
to establish a commercial company independent from its defence and aerospace
operations.
The move was warmly welcomed on Wall Street, where Litton's stock rose more
than 14 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at Dollars 65 1/8
, up Dollars 8 1/8 .
Litton said the new company would include its oilfield information services
and industrial automation businesses and would have annual revenues of
around Dollars 2bn.
Shares in the new company would be distributed to holders of Litton's common
stock and the deal should be completed before the end of 1993.
Analysts said the commercial company, whose subsidiaries have strong
positions in their respective markets, would enjoy a stock market rating
much superior to that of the group as a whole.
The move is somewhat unusual for a defence company, since most businesses in
this sector, faced with declining Pentagon spending, have been seeking to
diversify into commercial operations to bolster profits.
Another exception to this trend is General Dynamics, which has aggressively
sold off commercial businesses to concentrate on its core defence
operations.
Mr Alton Brann, Litton chief executive, said growing commercial markets and
the consolidating defence industry demand different corporate strategies. By
responding to each separately, 'both our businesses will benefit, as should
our shareholders'.
Some 60 per cent of the new company's revenues will come from oil services,
where its Western Atlas business is a top supplier of seismic, well logging
and reservoir information.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Raid on Miramar shares may
herald takeover war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TAKEOVER battle for Miramar Hotel and Investment between some of Hong
Kong's biggest property market participants appeared likely last night when
Henderson Investment told the Hong Kong stock exchange it had acquired an
interest in the company.
Henderson's raid on Miramar came as Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong and Citic
Pacific, Beijing's stock market listed vehicle in the colony, raised the
value of their offer for the company by HKDollars 550m to HKDollars 9.25bn
(USDollars 1.19bn) in an attempt to placate a disgruntled Miramar board.
Miramar is seen by property analysts in Hong Kong as being one of the best
companies with access to the colony's tightly held property market. The
company has extensive land holdings on the Kowloon peninsula which are seen
by analysts as ideal for redevelopment.
It owns the 500-room Miramar Hotel in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon's main tourist
district, as well as 900,000 sq ft of office space. Analysts believe either
or both properties could be redeveloped to increase lettable space and to
tap the growing market for strata titled (joint ownership) office space.
It was unclear last night how much of Miramar Henderson Investment had
acquired. Talk in Hong Kong's stock market put the interest above 30 per
cent. If so, this would indicate that Miramar's two substantial shareholders
had accepted Henderson's offer.
Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific were forced to raise their offer for Miramar
shares by HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 16.5 a share, and by HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 9.50 for the company's warrants.
The two came under pressure to raise their bid - which was announced on June
10 - after a senior executive of Miramar rejected the offer claiming it was
'unfriendly' and asserted the company was worth HKDollars 20 a share.
Additionally, the company's share price has consistently traded above the
offer price. Miramar, which was suspend-ed from trading yesterday, ended
Thursday's trading at HKDollars 16.20.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: New managing director at Monte
dei Paschi di Siena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTE dei Paschi di Siena, the oldest bank in the world and once a byword
for conservative lending and low profile finance, has appointed a new
managing director, a month after four executives were implicated in
corruption allegations.
The election of Mr Vincenzo Pennarola, a long-standing manager, marks the
latest step in a drama which has shaken Siena and cast new doubts on the
cosy relationships between bank executives, the town council and the wider
world of Tuscan finance.
Matters changed when police arrested members of the bank board on corruption
charges last month. The detentions were soon followed by warnings to Mr
Carlo Zini, chief executive, that he, too, was under investigation.
Mr Zini announced his readiness to step down earlier this month. As his
successor has to be chosen by the Italian treasury - headed, ironically, by
the bank's former chairman, Mr Piero Barucci - the sense of expectation rose
pending an announcement.
Last week, the government committee responsible publicly passed the buck to
Siena itself.
Monte dei Paschi has an unusually close relationship with its home town,
based on the fact that it is indirectly controlled by the city and deeply
rooted in urban tradition.

<TEXT>
THE stock exchanges of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland have agreed to
establish Nordquote, a common Nordic securities trading system.
By bringing the four, relatively small stock markets together, the Nordic
exchanges hope that it will make their markets more attractive and stop the
tendency for trading volume to drift away to London, said Mr Bent Mebus,
managing director of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
Initially, Nordquote will include about 20 shares, but Mr Mebus said he
expected that as the system develops around 100 Nordic blue-chip shares in
which there is a 'significant international interest' will be traded through
the system.
Mr Mebus said that as far as he knew this was the first time that the stock
exchanges of different countries had agreed to establish a joint trading
system, an aim which has so far eluded other European stock exchanges.
Nordquote will be open only to Nordic brokers. It means that an outside
investor will only have to contact one Nordic broker in order to trade in
the shares of any one of the four countries.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kugelfischer unit in liquidation

<TEXT>
EASTERN Germany's fragile industrial base suffered a telling blow yesterday
when Kugelfischer, the bearings group, put its crippled Leipzig-based
subsidiary into liquidation.
Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken Leipzig, which employs more than 2,000 people in
four factories, had failed to obtain further public or private backing, and
was unable to meet its obligations, the management said.
The Treuhand privatisation agency which sold the east German company to
Kugelfischer three years ago, said it was the worst corporate collapse in
its experience, although other privatised companies were in difficulties.
Kugelfischer had offered to give DKFL back to the agency, but there was no
contractual or legal basis for its return, the Treuhand said.
Kugelfischer, which supplies bearings to most of German industry, lost
DM439m (Dollars 265m) last year, while the deficit within the German parent
concern soared to DM630m after a DM4m net profit in 1991.
A restructuring plan launched at the start of this year originally proposed
the elimination of 6,500 of the group's 23,000 jobs and the sale of non-core
businesses employing a further 6,500.
Following the appointment of Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a company consultant,
Kugelfischer took an even tougher line on costs and overheads, planning to
close or sell more than half its complement of 17 factories, affecting 7,550
employees.
Kugelfischer said last month that there was no solution in sight for DKFL,
formerly one of the biggest bearings makers in the eastern bloc. In 1991,
the last year for which full figures are available, it lost DM142m on sales
of DM113m. In 1992, losses were about DM300m.
Kugelfischer was one of the first of Germany's industrial companies to feel
the effects of international recession.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Toyota unveils cost-cutting plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, Japan's largest car group, will reduce the number of styles on
individual models and standardise some components to curb costs.
The group might also review investment plans and seek cuts in administrative
expenses, but did not plan any job reductions, said Mr Tatsuro Toyoda,
president.
This is the latest example of the Japanese car industry's attempts to slim
costs in line with depressed demand, down 10 per cent there last month. It
indicates that European and US carmakers will be hard put to close the cost
gap between themselves and their Japanese competitors as they take an axe to
their own workforces.
However, Mr Toyoda believed 'the gap between relative costs won't be so
wide,' on export markets because of the impact of the yen's strength.
'Over the past five years, we might have set too high a sales target and
increased variations of sales perhaps too drastically,' said Mr Toyoda.
Yet he saw no need to reduce the 74,000 workforce since Toyota had a labour
shortage only three years ago and could well have one again in the future.
Instead, Mr Toyoda was seeking to reduce average annual working time from
2,300 hours to 1,900 hours 'more in line with international norms,' he said.
Mr Toyoda expected the group's overseas production to grow from 800,000
units to 1.5m units over the next few years, some of which would replace
exports from Japan, rather than being additional output. The group's world
output was 3.9m units last year, of which 1.7m were exported. Mitsubishi
Motors, the Japanese carmaker, will use engines and transmissions
manufactured by Chrysler in its US-made cars for the first time and plans to
export cars made in the US to Europe from next spring.
The move comes as Japanese carmakers have been hit hard by the rapid
appreciation of the yen, which has reduced their competitiveness by forcing
many to raise prices overseas.
The Japanese carmakers are also restricted by an agreement between Japan and
the EC to restrict Japanese car exports to the Community to a mutually
agreed level until 1999. Mitsubishi hopes to sell 10,000 annually of its
cars which will use Chrysler engines and transmissions.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rapid Renault-Volvo merger urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RAPID merger between Renault and Volvo is 'indispensable' for the
development and privatisation of the French car company, Mr Gerd Longuet,
France's industry minister, said yesterday.
But the two companies, which have had cross shareholdings in each other
since 1991, and the French state, which owns 80 per cent of Renault, are
still deep in negotiation over the balance of power between French and
Swedish interests. A conclusion to these negotiations is unlikely before
next month.
The key issue for Renault and its state owner is whether and in what
proportion French institutional investors might be brought in as a
counter-weight to Volvo, before the rest of the state's holding in Renault
is sold off to the French public.
Last month Renault was put on the Balladur government's list of 21 companies
to be privatised over the next few years.
Renault and Volvo have had significant industrial success in bringing their
management, production planning, design and purchasing together since
1990-1991.
The government's general privatisation bill, now before parliament, has
advanced the merger discussions, because the bill would also remove the 25
per cent limit on private shareholdings in Renault. At present, AB Volvo,
the Swedish car company's holding group, has 20 per cent of Renault, which
in turn has 8 per cent of AB Volvo, and both companies hold sizeable stakes
in each other's individual car and truck operations.
Passage of the privatisation bill, expected in mid-July, would not only
allow Volvo to raise its stake in Renault, but also permit some big French
investors to enter into its capital.
The French privatisation practice has been to arrange noyaux durs, or groups
of theoretically long term share holders, before floating the rest of state
companies off on the stock market.
Volvo said yesterday it had been aware for some time that the French
government was considering some kind of golden share or core group of
investors in Renault after privatisation. It added: 'We cannot comment on
the issue of changes in ownership at Renault.'
Mr Longuet also yesterday expressed his impatience with another
privatisation candidate, Groupe Bull. He said the state-controlled computer
company had still not produced a 'tough enough' business plan to show it
could do without recurrent French state aid.

FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sculley refines role at Apple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer and one of
the most widely known executives in the computer industry, will stand down
as chief executive to focus on new business opportunities for the personal
computer company.
Apple announced yesterday that Mr Michael Spindler, formerly president and
chief operating officer, will become chief executive while Mr Sculley will
remain chairman.
The announcement follows widespread speculation that Mr Sculley might be
planning to leave Apple after 10 years with the company. Earlier this year,
Mr Sculley was considered for the post of chairman and chief executive of
IBM, but IBM rejected his proposal to merge parts of IBM with Apple and sell
off other portions of IBM.
Mr Sculley is also interested in starting his own high-tech company. 'That
is a dream that I have for the future, but right now there is nothing else
that I would rather be doing than building new business opportunities for
Apple,' Mr Sculley said. 'I remain fully committed to Apple.'
'My personal interests have long been in defining the opportunities and
technologies for Apple in the convergence of computing, communications and
content,' Mr Sculley said. 'There is so much to be done here, and now I will
be able to concentrate fully on these activities, while Michael runs the
company.'
Mr Sculley has been grooming Mr Spindler as his successor for the past two
years. Mr Spindler was appointed Apple president and chief operating officer
in 1990 in charge of Apple's day-to-day operations. A year later he joined
the board of directors.
Mr Spindler has long played a central role in Apple's corporate strategy and
is credited by close associates with having been the 'management strength
behind Sculley's vision'. In his new role as chief executive, however, Mr
Spindler will be thrust into the public eye far more than in the past.
The smooth management transition at Apple is in sharp contrast to the drama
surrounding Mr Sculley's appointment as chairman in 1986 when Apple
co-founder Mr Steve Jobs was ousted in a boardroom coup.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Tin prices rally from
20-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIN market yesterday continued its dogged recovery from the 20-year lows
reached earlier in the week. The three months position on the London Metal
Exchange, which in after hours dealings on Tuesday had dipped to Dollars
5,067.50 a tonne, closed yesterday at Dollars 5,240 a tonne, up Dollars
97.50 on the day and Dollars 10 on the week.
Dealers described the stronger performance in the second half of the week as
a 'corrective bounce'. But they said sentiment was still shaky as market was
awaiting the rise in arrivals that had been signalled by an evident
slackening in the resolve of members of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries to continue their efforts to bolster the market through export
restraint.
ATPC members, who account for some 60 per cent of world tin production, have
been disheartened to see their self-denying policy undermined by increased
exports from China, which is not a member of the association, and by the
emergence of Russia, previously a small net importer of tin, as a net
exporter.
'There is now widespread frustration among members of the ATPC at the
futility of the export scheme,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill
Lynch financial services group. 'The feeling is growing that export curbs
should be scrapped and everyone should go out there and produce and export
all they can.' That would push prices down to a level where higher-cost
producers would be forced out of production.
Other LME metals were also higher on the week. The biggest rise was in the
copper market, where the three months position recovered Pounds 38 of last
week's Pounds 54 fall to close yesterday at Pounds 1,246.25 a tonne. Aided
by a narrowing of premiums on forward deliveries and caution ahead of the
expiry of US and Chilean labour contracts at the end of this month, the
price broke overhead resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,850 a tonne
in midweek. A fresh resistance area was encountered around Dollars 1,870,
however, and yesterday's closing price was near the Dollars 1,850-a-tonne
mark.
The aluminium market's three-week rise was halted on Monday, when the three
months price fell Dollars 11.25 to Dollars 1,171.25 a tonne. But most of the
fall was quickly recouped and a Dollars 29.50 rise yesterday left the price
Dollars 22.25 up on the week at Dollars 1,204.75 a tonne.
Dealers noted that yesterday's price rise came despite the announcement of
the biggest rise for some time in LME aluminium stocks. But they explained
that the 50,500-tonnes rise, which took the total to a fresh record of
1,868,925 tonnes, probably reflected the arrival of Russian material delayed
by bureacratic problems and the registration of new compound and warehouse
areas in Antwerp.
In contrast LME stock movements provided support for the nickel market.
After the announcement of a third successive fall the three months price
gained Dollars 15 yesterday to end Dollars 7.50 up on the week at Dollars
5,625 a tonne.
Traders suggested that the stocks downturn mainly reflected delays in
Russian shipments. But Mr Nick, analyst at Ord Minnett, said he was
nevertheless encouraged by the prospect that June might see a net monthly
outflow from LME nickel stocks, which would be the first since November
1991.
He also noted, in Ord's Daily Metal Market Monitor, that the economy was
recovering in Japan, the biggest nickel consumer, and that sales from the
former eastern bloc were running lower. 'The nickel price will not recover
until LME stocks start to be eroded,' Mr Moore said. 'Perhaps this is not
too far away.'
The gold market began the week by crashing through the Dollars
370-a-troy-ounce support level that had been so stoutly defended during the
previous week. But after shedding Dollars 7.20 to Dollars 363.95 on Monday
the price began a steady recovery that saw it back at square one by
Thursday's close. At yesterday's close it was Dollars 372.25 an ounce, up
Dollars 1.10 on the week. This was seen as a reasonably constructive
performance in view of the dollar's strength and signs of an easing in
inflationary pressure in the US.
Lacking any clear direction of its own, the platinum price followed gold's
early fall, reaching Dollars 376.35 an ounce on Tuesday. But it lagged
behind in the subsequent upturn and ended the week Dollars 7.75 down on
balance at Dollars 379 an ounce.
Platinum continued to be outshone by its sister metal, palladium, used
mainly by the dentistry and electronics sectors and as a motor exhaust
catalyst. Continuing supply tightness, good physical demand and bullish
chart patterns combined to push the metal's price to a 38-month high of
Dollars 129 an ounce at yesterday's morning fixing. It fell back in the
afternoon to Dollars 127.90, up 90 cents on the week, but traders were still
talking of Dollars 130 an ounce as the short term target, with Dollars 140
possible in the medium term.
London's coffee and cocoa futures markets put in stronger performances. The
former was aided yesterday by news of Brazilian private sector proposals for
a production retention scheme, while the latter succeeded at last in
breaking through the Pounds 700 barrier. September coffee position closed at
Dollars 929, up Dollars 25 on the week, and September cocoa at Pounds 715 a
tonne, up Pounds 35.
In Chicago soyabean traders responded to growing concern about rain-induced
US planting delays by pushing new crop November futures up to Dollars 6.05 a
bushel in late trading yesterday, up 24 cents on the week.

Shares in Bimec Industries were halved from 8 1/4 p to 4p yesterday as the
engineering and waste treatment group announced that losses for the year to
March 31 would be 'materially higher than that shown at the half-year' and
there would be 'a significant excess of liabilities over assets', writes
Peter Pearse.
At half-time, pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 7.87m (profits Pounds 3m).
Mr Barber, the company doctor brought in to replace Mr Sam Smith as chairman
and chief executive in September, said that, although Aero &amp; Industrial
Technology, the gas turbine combustion company he was most keen to dispose
of, had been 'reduced and reorganised into a good company', so far it had
not been possible to find a buyer.
Accordingly, there had been 'no material improvement in the net cash
position, he said, and without Lloyds Bank's support, Bimec would be 'in
peril'. It employs 1,000 people, down 500 since he joined.

market

<TEXT>
Liberty Mutual, a Boston-based insurer, is to invest Pounds 85m in its
London market subsidiary. The investment, which increases paid-up capital of
the company from Pounds 15m to Pounds 100m, reflects increasing confidence
by investors in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets, after
recent rises in rates.
Mr Dick Hazell, chairman of the UK subsidiary described the new investment
as 'timely'. Mr Hazell, who was previously deputy chairman of the Lloyd's of
London insurance market, said: 'It represents an act of faith in the London
market which, in view of the improving climate for insurance will prove
amply justified'.
Mr Mark Bodkin, another former Lloyd's underwriter, is to become managing
director of the new company. Other senior underwriters are also being
recruited.
The company is understood to be seeking to play a leading role in a number
of market sectors - including marine reinsurance, aviation, property and
casualty catastrophe business, from next year.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cairn Energy raising Dollars 25m for
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cairn Energy, the oil and gas exploration company, is selling 4.75m new
shares in its US subsidiary as well as up to 1m existing shares in an offer
that is expected to raise up to Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.6m).
Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the US company would use the proceeds
to develop a 200bn cu ft gas discovery recently made in the Gulf of Mexico.
'The discovery meant that the US part was becoming the major area of our
business and we wanted to use the share sale to re-balance the group,' he
said.
The receipts from the sale will also be used to repay debts of Dollars 2.6m
to Cairn and Dollars 3.6m to its parent in redemption of preferred stock.
These payments, together with the proceeds from the sale of Cairn's shares,
will leave the company with Dollars 11.2m which it plans to use for
developing its current interests and for future investment.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cash alternative at TV-am
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIRECTOR of TV-am, the former breakfast television company, promised
yesterday that if the company decided to move into the casino business, a
cash alternative would be available to shareholders.
Mr Richard Redmayne of stockbrokers Smith New Court and one of five
remaining TV-am directors, said the company had begun exploring the improved
market for 'shell companies'.
TV-am was outbid for its franchise by Good Morning Television and ceased
broadcasting on January 1. The original intention had been to go for a
voluntary liquidation and distribute to shareholders the remaining assets of
between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m.
Mr Redmayne confirmed however, that the five remaining directors were
talking to Crockfords, the Mayfair casino company, about the possibility of
an acquisition. If the deal goes ahead, there would be a simultaneous rights
issue, flotation and acquisition.
Mr Redmayne emphasised that in such circumstances there would be a cash
alternative for any TV-am shareholders who did not want shares in the new
combined group. However, if the Crockfords talks do not lead to a deal,
another leisure group is in the wings.
The aim of the TV-am directors - as a trading entity the company no longer
exists and doesn't even have a telephone - is to explore possibilities of
adding to shareholder value while still retaining the liquidation option.

relating to discontinuing the property division. The retained loss was
Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 313,000).

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Electronic Data slips to Pounds 2.34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC DATA Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software and
services group, reported flat interim profits yesterday. At the same time,
the company announced two new software products underlining its shift in
focus to higher margin software publishing.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 slipped from Pounds 2.41m to
Pounds 2.34m, on turnover which declined to Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 7.47m).
The slight fall in turnover came despite a first time contribution of Pounds
400,000 from the group's two new US acquisitions, Via Systems and Open,
acquired in November, which partly offset an 8 per cent decline in UK
turnover reflecting the continued slide in hardware prices.
Operating profit from existing operations edged ahead to Pounds 2.05m
(Pounds 2.04m), but was offset by an Pounds 11,000 loss posted by the recent
acquisitions and a decline in net interest received which fell to Pounds
300,000 (Pounds 366,000).
EDP has been refocusing its business away from low margin hardware
distribution, which accounted for about 40 per cent of turnover in the
latest period, towards software publishing and services provision.
Service revenues, which include both equipment maintenance fees and
recurring revenues through licensing the group's highly successful Merchant
software for wholesale distributors, are now running at an annualised rate
of Pounds 8m.
The company has invested heavily in research and development in recent years
to design new software which will work with 'open systems'.
It has spent Pounds 2.5m developing UniVision, an advanced database
management software product for PICK programmes, and Axiom, a portable
graphical user interface (GUI) programme initially developed by Via Systems.
Despite the continuing investment in R&amp;D, the group ended March with cash
balances of Pounds 10.4m and Mr Richard Jowitt, chief executive, said the
group was still looking for possible acquisitions.
Earnings per share slipped to 18.07p (18.83p), out of which the group is
paying an unchanged interim dividend of 2p per share.

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Court order for US arm of Pilkington -
Ex-employees deny wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBBEY-Owens-Ford, the US subsidiary of Pilkington, the glass products
group, has obtained a court order preventing sensitive internal information
that had allegedly been fraudulently acquired from being damaged or misused.
The order came after Lof alleged in a US court that its former chief
executive and two executive vice-presidents had conspired with an Ohio
University business professor, Clarence Martin, to give data-processing
contracts to a company they jointly controlled, Computer Technology
Management. CTM allegedly charged some Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) in unwarranted
consulting fees for managing the information, described as Lof's 'central
nervous system'.
Mr Ronald Skeddle, former chief executive, and Mr Edward Bryant and Mr
Darryl Costin, vice-presidents, were fired from Lof last month. Pilkington
then said that the problem did not involve 'a major financial loss' and that
Lof's customers and operations were not affected.
The former executives, named in court rather than in court papers, and Mr
Martin, have through their lawyers denied any wrongdoing.
Lof has further alleged that in or around March 1991 the defendants
'conspired to create a scheme to acquire valuable gas wells owned by Lof at
an artificially low price and to thereby convert the assets of Lof to their
own use and enjoyment.' In March the defendants allegedly channelled a
leasing contract for robots to a company controlled by Mr Martin, at an
'exorbitant lease rate grossly in excess of fair market value leasing
rates', the court paper said.
Lof has demanded the defendants pay compensatory and punitive damages,
return illicit profits, and rescind contracts with their former company.

</HEADLINE>

The Bankers Investment Trust saw its net asset value increase by nearly 15
per cent in the six months ended April 30 1993. That compared favourably
with the principal indices in the UK, US and Europe.
The value per share was 153.5p against 133.6p at the trust's year-end in
October and 131.8p a year earlier. Its strategy during the six months has
been to remain fully invested with increased emphasis on the UK, Far East
and Japan.
At April 30 the UK accounted for 52.7 per cent of the portfolio, the rest of
Europe 11.5 per cent and the US 20.7 per cent.
Total revenue came to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.42m) and earnings per share rose
9.9 per cent to 1.88p (1.71p). A similar rate of growth was expected in the
second half.
The year's earnings will comfortably exceed the minimum forecast total
dividend of 3.6p. A second interim of 0.9p (0.86p) is declared.

Cambridge Water Company, which supplies water to the Cambridge area,
improved pre-tax profits by 36 per cent from Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 2.94m in
the year to March 31.
Mr Peter Shaw, chairman, said the high level of capital expenditure in the
past three years had provided enough water resources to meet growth in
demand for the foreseeable future. From now on, he said, capital expenditure
should be at a much lower level and be funded from retained profits.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Earnings worked through at
726p (535p) per share and a final dividend of 115p (70p) is recommended for
a 170p (115p) total.
Regarding the Sawston Mill case, Mr Shaw said the appeal court found in the
company's favour. An appeal by the defending company would be held in the
House of Lords on October 11.

Improved trading performance continued into the second half at Hobson, and
resulted in the group returning to profit for the year ended March 31 1993.
Additionally, the acquisition of Cadismark and rationalisation of its
production into the Shepshed Toiletries factory resulted in the cost savings
and increased efficiencies envisaged.
At the pre-tax level, the profit came to Pounds 140,000, compared with a
loss of Pounds 210,000, from turnover of Pounds 9.04m (Pounds 6.35m).
Earnings per share were 0.2p (losses 0.41p).
The directors said they were committed to the expansion of the consumer
products division through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth,
and commodity trading was likely to diminish in importance in future
results.

Shares in Beales Hunter fell 27p to close at 265p yesterday after the
refrigeration and electrical components company warned that profits for the
year to May 31 would be 'slightly below' the Pounds 2.3m achieved last time.
The company said that trading levels in the refrigeration division had been
held back by poor weather conditions which affected the level of service
activity, and by a loss on a contract completed at its Rock Refrigeration
subsidiary.
The group's financial position remained strong and trading in the
refrigeration division had improved in June with service activity back to

FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Trust cuts losses to Pounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE TRUST, the mini con-glomerate, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds
12m to Pounds 7.59m in 1992. Of that, interest acc-ounted for Pounds 7.42m
reflecting the high bank debt outstanding as a result of former losses in
the parent company.
The group is engaged in merchanting and distribution and in film, television
and lighting. Turnover rose to Pounds 84.4m (Pounds 82.7m) and generated a
gross operating profit of Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 21.9m).
Losses per share worked through at 0.9p (1.4p).
The directors considered the group was making good progress. Apart from
maintaining and developing the value of remaining investments, the primary
object was the successful completion of the litigation programme seeking
recovery for past losses from certain former professional advisers.
The action with SBS Securities would start next May, and the case against
the former auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, was expected to commence
in January 1995.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Local government - no change may be best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms FIONA REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Local Counsel' (June 17), concerning the review of local
government structure hits the nail on the head. The Local Government
Commission has clearly got off to a difficult start. This is perhaps
unsurprising in view of the strong historical identity of many local
authorities and the vitally important functions they perform, especially -
from the point of view of the Council for the Protection of Rural England -
those concerning environmental protection, such as minerals, transport and
land use planning.
CPRE believes the 'no change' option - one which the commission assures us
remains on the table - deserves much more careful consideration. Apart from
obvious problems with some of the more recent creations, the case for a
radical review of local government structures has not generally been well
made. As your leader recognises, the existing two-tier structure of
districts and counties, far from resulting in a duplication of
responsibilities, combines to provide locally sensitive service delivery and
accountable strategic decision-making. The early signs are that the
commission is attaching insufficient weight to the status quo as an option.
The final decision, remains, of course, in the government's hands. The
environment secretary, John Gummer, could with advantage remember the
environmental benefits of the current system.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Detailed accounts needed of political donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH P ARMITAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Conservative party is playing the game of political donations too
close to its chest ('Tory party to return Nadir funds if they were stolen',
June 16). Regardless, it would appear that Asil Nadir is not the only
foreign national to donate money to the Conservative party during the past
decade and this raises the question of accountability.
The number and amount of these donations calls into question the system of
political funding in the UK and whether or not donations are a means of
purchasing influence and other favours. It is time that all political
parties were obliged, by law, to publish detailed accounts, including names
of donors, to allow the public to assess whether there are any implications.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Independence and objectives of a central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan writes (Economic Viewpoint, June 17): 'I would give
central banks responsibility for avoiding deflation as well as inflation.'
This is exactly what the US Federal Reserve already has. 'As the nation's
central bank, it attempts to ensure that growth in money and credit over the
long run is sufficient to encourage growth in the economy in line with its
potential and with reasonable price stability. In the short run the Federal
Reserve seeks to adapt its policies to combat deflationary or inflationary
pressures as they may arise.' (The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and
Functions. Board of Governors, Washington DC, 1984.)
The independence of the central bank and its policy objectives are thus two
separate questions. A non-independent central bank can be given price
stability as its sole objective, and an independent central bank can be
given objectives other than price stability. The current debate often fails
to recognise this point.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Hardship committee is not the real answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER SAUNDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Hamilton Stutt's letter (June 1) summed up the inequity of what
Lloyd's is attempting to put over on the ruined Names. Mr Michael Wade, a
working Name and market practitioner, on the other hand does not seem to
appreciate the real size of the problem (Letters, June 2).
It is possible, though unlikely, that he has suffered the level of loss that
I and probably Mr Stutt have had to endure. My Lloyd's accounts and
estimates show I have lost at least Pounds 1.1m in the four years of account
to December 1990, and when final results are out undoubtedly still more.
This, on a premium limit averaging Pounds 293,000, is a bit rich. It could
take all my assets and more. Multiple exposure to Gooda Walker and Feltrim
has done it, as for many others. It looked like diversification but was not.
The Lime St members agency (involuntary liquidation) chose my syndicates
with Lloyd's full knowledge.
The business plan following the task force report seeks to show how this
kind of personal catastrophe should be impossible under the regime of the
future. It seems significant that in arguing for the changes very damaging
admissions are made, explicitly and implicitly, about failure to regulate
the market in the past.
So some of us are amazed that it is taking so long to produce a better
answer than the hardship committee (really a debt collector). If nothing
else is done, like Samson blinded, we are quite prepared to pull down the
pillars of the Philistines' temple. But if sensible arrangements are made to
take care of the negligent or perhaps illegal parts of our losses, then we
will gladly co-operate and so help Lloyd's to continue and trade profitably.
Interestingly, the proposed 80 per cent high level stop loss scheme would
have paid Pounds 733,000 of my losses had it been in place. Perhaps that
suggests a solution?

FT  19 JUN 93 / Canons win close combat: Vanessa Houlder on a reprieve for
church property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Anthony Trollope satirised clerical life in his Barchester
novels, England's outwardly tranquil cathedral closes have been perceived as
hotbeds of gossip and skulduggery.
This image has been revived in a wrangle about money and power concerning
the ownership of property in cathedral closes. On Monday, the House of
Commons agreed to a Lords amendment excluding cathedral closes from new
legislation giving leaseholders the right to buy their homes.
The Lords' decision was greeted with dismay by those affected. 'It is not
right that people who have been loyal in paying their rent over umpteen
years should not have the right to purchase their homes,' said one resident.
'I have never been fond of the idea that state rulings should not apply to
the church.'
The prospect of enfranchisement had aroused equal dismay among many clergy,
prompting the House of Lords to intervene on their behalf. They feared that
enfranchisement, which would force cathedrals to sell the freehold of
properties in closes which have been let on long leases, could damage the
atmosphere and architectural integrity of the precincts. The amendment was
passed by 123 to 107 votes in the Lords.
The amendment to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill
was not the result of behind-the-scenes lobbying from the Church
Commissioners, but the work of the Association of Land Owning Charities,
which numbers some chapters among its members. The Church Commissioners
candidly admit that they did not try to secure the amendment because they
did not expect to succeed.
They may have underestimated the Lords' respect for the place of the Church
of England in English society. The church, argued one peer, Lord Williams,
deserved to be given the same privileges as the National Trust and the Crown
Estate, which were exempted from the bill. 'After all, the Church of England
is the established church of the land and therefore should have some rights
in the matter,' he said.
Another point that weighed heavily with the Lords was the cathedrals' need
to preserve control over their closes. The Bishop of Guildford voiced
concern about the risk of damaging their 'religious and community focus'.
The Bishop of Chichester said 'it would be a very unhappy situation and
might cause a great deal of trouble' if precincts passed out of the final
control of the dean and chapter, responsible for their maintenance.
In fact, the degree of control exercised by a dean over the residents of a
cathedral close already varies. In the view of some chapters, piety is an
important qualification for living in a close. According to the former
occupant of one close, it was important to be well regarded by a dean when a
lease was due for renewal. 'The dean and chapter were negotiating with some
people one way and some the other,' he said. 'They liked to manipulate it to
keep the tone right.'
But in many closes, the chapter has relinquished much of its control over
residents by selling long leases. Some properties, which came into the remit
of the 1967 Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, have been sold freehold.
In many cases, this was the result of financial necessity. In Salisbury, for
instance, close properties used to be let, at low rents, to deserving cases
such as canons' widows. But by the end of the 1960s, the soaring cost of
maintaining properties forced the chapter to treat its properties on a more
commercial basis.
Of the 80 houses in the close, there are now just 20 on the old-fashioned
'soft' leases. Another 20 properties are used for the staff of the dean and
chapter. The remainder have been sold on long leases to the highest bidder.
And Salisbury Close, widely seen as the most beautiful cathedral close in
the country, attracts high bidders. One five-bedroom house is on the market
for Pounds 900,000.
The case of Salisbury might allay some of the fears about a dean
relinquishing control over the residents in a close. The newer residents,
who include Sir Edward Heath and other MPs, writers and businessmen, are
generally perceived to be sympathetic to the character of the place, if not
necessarily devout.
'At least 60 per cent take no role in the life and work of the cathedral,'
said an elderly inhabitant of the close. 'But they are not opposed to the
work of the church. If you come into the close, you do not have beer parties
or dances.'
But even if the chapter in Salisbury does not regret that it is no longer
able to pick and choose its residents, the prospect of enfranchisement gave
it a feeling of insecurity. 'Restrictions are not as enforceable with
freeholds,' says Mr David Barke, who advises the chapter on the management
of the close. He shudders at the idea that the chapter could not prevent a
building being turned, for example, into a political office.
Nonetheless, he has no complaints about the residents' willingness to
maintain the buildings. 'The people who bought those properties look after
them 10 times better than the chapter did in the 1950s and 1960s,' said Mr
Barke.
The willingness of residents to look after their property is, in some
respects, at the heart of the debate about enfranchisement. One of the main
concerns that led to the Lords amendment was whether enfranchisement would
threaten a close's role as 'an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the urban
environment'.
Champions of the amendment, such as Lord Monson, argue that closes owe their
character to 'integrated long-term planning made possible by the enlightened
management policies of their governing bodies'.
The government, however, believes that estate management schemes and the
planning system are sufficient to maintain the character of closes.
Some residents go further, believing that the cathedrals are not
particularly worthy stewards of their architectural heritage. Over recent
years, the cathedrals' need to provide facilities for tourists and raise
funds to maintain their buildings have forced them to propose developments
that have been bitterly opposed by conservationists.
While nobody doubts that the closes need to be conserved, some of their
residents will continue to think that the case for excluding them from the
enfranchisement legislation has not been properly made.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Much too costly a saving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your story, 'Universities allowed to charge top-up fees for tuition'
(June 9), does this government decision herald a slow return to the days
when only the eldest child in wealthier families could be educated at
university?
Surely, if savings in public expenditure must be made it would be far
preferable to eliminate tax relief on mortgages once and for all. This
subsidy could be removed with relatively little pain during the current
period of low interest rates and might even be announced as a prelude to
some further lowering. Sadly, it would be all too typical of British
political priorities if bricks and mortar were to take precedence over
genuinely open access to higher education.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Basic skills don't add up: The high rate of adult illiteracy
is placing a heavy burden on industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might not seem difficult to calculate 10 per cent of Pounds 4,900, but a
survey published this week found that 23 per cent of the UK's 21-year-olds
could not work out the answer - even with calculators.
The survey, conducted by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, an
independent government-funded agency, poses rather more difficult questions
for educators and industrialists. It indicated that one in five young adults
needs urgent help with numeracy, while one in seven has serious problems
with literacy.
Many more had a barely adequate command of reading, writing and arithmetic.
For example, 35 per cent of the 21-year-olds had mathematical skills
inferior to those expected by the national curriculum of a 12-year-old.
Such difficulties with basic skills cause problems for those who suffer
them. But they also inflict great damage on the economy.
A separate survey of 400 companies by the Albsu, carried out at the end of
last year, produced an estimate that the total cost of poor basic skills to
industry in the UK was Pounds 4.83bn a year. This estimate includes Pounds
2.5bn as the cost of rectifying customer orders dispatched incorrectly, and
Pounds 1.8bn for the cost of lost custom and orders.
Industrialists believe such costs are growing, and will continue to grow, as
the changing workplace requires greater skills. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman
and chief executive of Heath Springs, a small West Midlands spring
manufacturer, said: 'In the last five years there has been a dramatic change
in the skills needed on my shop floor. The artisans who work here don't just
have to measure the components they produce, as in the past. Now, the whole
factory is run using statistical controls. If you don't have workers with
the basic skills required, those controls will fail.'
Many workers were uneasy about their ability to use computers when the
company introduced them. And Mr Roberts has had problems bringing in the
Japanese technique of 'visual management', which uses written signs on the
shop-floor to direct workers. Such techniques are doomed to failure if the
workers cannot read.
Mr Roberts does not believe his workforce has grown less literate; what has
changed is that he now needs a higher standard of literacy among his
employees. While illiteracy was once a problem that could be ignored,
industry is now forced to confront it. As Mr Roberts said: 'If companies
aren't bothered whether their employees are literate or numerate, they won't
be internationally competitive and they may as well close down now.'
Precise international comparisons are difficult, but research suggests the
UK's problems are not unique. In Australia, 28 per cent of those tested
failed an exam in 'practical' literacy, which involved such tasks as filling
in forms.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress in the US found in 1989 that
42 per cent of the population had difficulties with day-to-day tasks, such
as working out percentages on a restaurant bill. In Canada, 38 per cent of
the adult population had 'some difficulty dealing with the reading demands
they encounter in their everyday lives', according to an extensive survey
carried out by Statistics Canada in 1990.
Estimates by the UN agency Unesco for European countries put the proportion
of the population having some difficulty with basic skills at 15-25 per cent
in Belgium, 15-20 per cent in France, 15-25 per cent in Italy and 15-30 per
cent in Spain and Portugal.
It is far from clear how to attack the problem. During the 1970s, adult
literacy programmes were emphasised - perhaps most memorably in the BBC
television series On The Move in which the actor Bob Hoskins played an adult
illiterate nervously encouraging himself to go to evening reading classes.
But teaching adults is difficult, complicated and expensive, according to Ms
Ann Barnes, general secretary of the National Association for the Teaching
of English. 'They develop inhibitions and defence mechanisms', she said.
'Resources, skills and expertise should be put in at a very young stage.'
That shift in emphasis to improving basic skills among younger people has
now been adopted by the Department for Education. Last year, the department
announced grants of Pounds 4.4m for pilot projects in 'reading recovery'.
These were modelled on projects pioneered in New Zealand, in which
six-year-olds who had slipped behind in reading were given intensive
one-on-one tuition.
Parents provide another line of attack. Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, this week announced a small grant of Pounds 250,000 for pilot
schemes in family literacy, modelled on programmes developed in the US,
where parents are given help with reading and encouraged to help teach their
children.
Neither approach is uncontroversial, however. Ann Barnes of the National
Association for the Teaching of English is dubious about reading recovery
programmes, which she believes to be unnecessarily expensive. Resources
might have been better used by experimenting in the use of computers in the
classroom to help children read and write, she says.
Nor is it always possible to rely on parents: the Albsu research shows that
children who have difficulty with reading and writing often have parents
with the same difficulties. And some teachers are unhappy about encouraging
parents to help their children as it can make life difficult in the
classroom when some pupils have been taught to read while others have not.
Yet finding ways to raise the level of literacy and numeracy skills is
essential given their increasing importance at work. Not only employers lose
out when their employees are not fluent in reading and writing or with
numbers. Mr Patten likes to point out that adults of today who lack
confidence with language may be at a greater disadvantage than they would
have been in the Victorian era.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Eruption on the political landscape: A rebellion in the
ruling party could crack Japan's postwar parliamentary system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese are growing accustomed to their most cherished assumptions
being overturned.
In the past year the salarymen whose loyalty is the life-blood of Japanese
companies have found even they are expendable, as companies cut costs.
Japan's traditional deference towards the US has been replaced by a defiant
refusal to give in to the Clinton administration's calls for a greater US
share of Japanese markets.
But if there was one thing the Japanese could rely on, it was the Liberal
Democratic party. The party has ruled the country since 1955, steering it
from poverty and hunger in the wake of the second world war to become the
world's strongest economy in the 1980s. Now, even the LDP is losing its
grip.
Amid extraordinary scenes in the Japanese parliament yesterday evening, a
35-strong group of dissident LDP members revolted against their leaders.
Their rebellion threatens to crack the postwar edifice of Japanese politics.
The dissidents voted with an opposition party no-confidence motion, lodged
in complaint at the LDP's unwillingness to compromise over plans for
political reform. The revolt led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance
minister, brought down the government by 255 votes to 220. A general
election will be held in late July.
Japan's international partners will be the first to feel the effects of the
turmoil. The government will be paralysed just as Tokyo is preparing to host
the annual summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in early
July.
The consequences for Japan could be momentous, according to the snap
judgments offered yesterday. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, founder of the small but
popular New Japan party, compared the defeat to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Perhaps more appositely, Mr Hideo Sakamaki, the thoughtful president of
Nomura Securities, said the revolt was more far-reaching than former UK
prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's sacking. Business leaders and civil
service bureaucrats in private said it was a turning point.
There are two reasons why they could be right.
First, the future of the LDP is in doubt. With the economy not yet out of a
downturn which began two years ago, the LDP, stained by scandals, faces
losing its majority in parliament's lower house. A split in its ranks is
almost inevitable. The 35 rebels are likely to be expelled.
Second, the LDP's weakness could pave the way for a government committed to
reform of the political system.
However, history teaches caution on both issues. As parliamentarians begin
campaigning they will not rely on their parties for support, but on their
support groups, built up over many years. The personalised character of
Japanese politics is the root of many of its problems.
Japan has large parliamentary constituencies which each elect about five
members of parliament. To win election a member of the LDP has to compete
against other people from his own party. As it is difficult for members of
the same party to differentiate themselves by their policies, they choose
other methods, mainly involving money.
A good member of parliament brings home public works spending - railway
lines and bridges, sports stadiums and parks. He wins construction contracts
for local companies and presses the case for agricultural subsidies. One of
the main expenses born by a Japanese member of parliament is weddings. It is
usual for a representative of the local member of parliament to show up at a
wedding bearing an envelope of money.
The clearest evidence that Japanese politics is about personalities more
than policies is the way in which people get into parliament. The
fastest-growing group of parliamentarians are offspring of former
politicians who have inherited their father's support group and thus his
seat. The results of this system are obvious. Politicians need large sums of
money to finance their support groups, which makes them prone to corruption.
Their concerns are local, so their views tend to be parochial.
The inward-looking character of Japanese politics is unlikely to change
quickly. Nor is the LDP, though deeply unpopular, likely to be catapulted
out of power. There is no credible alternative. The opposition parties have
no well-defined economic policies, no experience of handling trade disputes
with the US, and their foreign policies pre-date the end of the cold war,
particularly in the case of the Social Democratic party, the largest
opposition party, which adheres to socialist ideology.
While many LDP supporters want to punish the party for its unwillingness to
reform, they do not want to dislodge it. They would prefer the party to
clean up its image, rather than to risk the unpredictable consequences of
ruffling the entire political system.
However, even if the LDP offers a change of leadership - Mr Miyazawa's
position is so weak that he will be forced to resign - it cannot return to
politics as normal, even if it emerges from the election as the single
largest party.
The reason is simple and powerful: the rapidity and scale of change in
Japanese society is finally forcing political change.
Pressure for reform is converging from several sources. Many business
leaders and bureaucrats believe Japan needs political institutions which are
more transparent to the outside world if it is to fulfil a larger global
role. The public wants reforms to limit corruption. Urban voters want reform
because the electoral system gives far greater weight to rural
constituencies.
These pressures are threatening to crack the LDP from within. This week's
crisis marks the collapse of the hierarchy which has run the party since the
1970s. Until last year the party had been dominated for almost 20 years by
the giant Takeshita faction, which kept discipline. But last year the
faction's powerbroker, Mr Shin Kanemaru, who also maintained friendly
relations with the opposition parties, was brought down in a corruption
scandal.
The party's leaders failed to fill the vacuum left by his departure. Their
loss of authority reflects a growing division within the LDP's ranks between
reformers and conservatives, younger politicians who represent younger, more
independent-minded voters and older traditionalists who come from rural
constituencies. Since the mid-1970s, the LDP has maintained its position by
transforming itself from a rural conservative party into a catch-all
coalition representing farmers and office staff, construction workers and
those in high-tech manufacturing.
The Hata group's revolt may break up that coalition. Attention will focus on
whether the eclectic band of reformers will coalesce into a new centrist
party - by no means a foregone conclusion. Yet the rebel Mr Hata and Mr
Hosokawa of the NJP are both popular among urban Japanese. The incentive of
holding the balance of power in a hung parliament could encourage them to
agree a common platform.
Mr Hata's group is beginning to develop specific proposals, but he has made
it clear that merely changing the rules of the electoral system will not be
enough. 'You have to change the way of thinking,' he says.
He argues that the LDP is incapable of coping with the economic and
diplomatic responsibilities Japan will face in the 1990s. The country needs
a clear line of political command, not the opaque policymaking of a
faction-ridden LDP. With few policy details worked out, Mr Hata's group has
nevertheless pledged to be radical, calling, for instance, for an overhaul
of Japan's so-called 'peace constitution' to allow it to play a larger role
in United Nations activities.
But before they get as far as deciding their strategy after the election,
the rebels will have a more pressing problem on their minds this weekend -
making sure they have collected enough money to deliver to all the weddings
between now and the end of July.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Forswear thy foolish ways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'SING FROM the same hymn sheet,' John Major urged his factious Cabinet
colleagues at Thursday's meeting. For his government has embarked on what
Downing Street has described as the toughest public spending round for 15
years.
But what hymns might the prime minister's colleagues sing as they prepare to
meet the Treasury's tough expenditure ceilings? 'Fight the good fight'?
Perhaps. 'Dear Lord and Father of mankind, forgive our foolish ways'?
Preferably. 'Lord of all hopefulness'? Probably. 'The strife is o'er, the
battle done'? Certainly not.
The targets for public spending in 1994-95 and 1995-96, reaffirmed at
Thursday's meeting, may be the toughest for 15 years, although the Treasury
agrees that defining such claims is problematic. But the government's limits
are certainly tougher than it has pursued in recent years. It plans to cap
the increase in the control total for public spending, adjusted for
recession-related items, so that, in real terms the increase between this
financial year and next will be broadly flat, which would make it the
tightest year since 1989 when the out-turn control total fell.
But, while 70 per cent of the deterioration in Britain's public finances
since then may be recession-induced, the other 30 per cent reflected a
deliberate political decision to spend now and pay later.
Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, the control total was allowed to rise by 5.1
per cent, while government expenditure rose as a percentage of gross
domestic product from 42 per cent in 1991-92 to 45 1/2 per cent this year.
Sooner or later, and probably sooner, the government - and thus the
electorate - was going to have to pay, either in reduced services or higher
taxes.
Strongest enemies
Mr Major's task is made vastly more complicated by the internal state of the
parliamentary Conservative party. Like Japanese prime minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, felled yesterday by a factional dispute within a Liberal
Democratic party which has held power too long, Mr Major's strongest enemies
are within his own party.
Mr Major's attempt to impose discipline on the spending round has been
undermined by repeated internal leaks in recent weeks: increased
prescription charges, hotel fees for hospital stays, cuts in invalidity
benefits, have all been unofficially floated into the public domain in order
to force the embattled premier and his increasingly powerful chancellor
either to take the political flak or shoot them down.
Nor have matters been helped by the apparent willingness of spending
ministries to ignore the Treasury's pleas for austerity and lodge increased
bids for spending, or the open public debate between left- and right-wing
members of the cabinet over whether taxes will have to rise further if the
combination of Mr Lamont's budget tax increases and the government's
spending plans prove insufficient.
As Mr Major knows from reading Trollope, singing together is only part of
the story. Archdeacon Grantly and Mr Slope, the bishop's chaplain, were both
members of the Church of England, sang in the cathedral together but still
pursued very different goals.
Yet it is far from certain whether the spending plans will be tough enough
for the economy. Chancellor Clarke skated over this issue in last week's
Mansion House speech. 'Public finances will be restored back towards balance
over the medium term,' he said, adding: 'If I judge that further action is
necessary, I shall not hesitate to take it.' But Mr Clarke gave no clues as
to whether, when or how these further measures might be taken.
Fiscal reconstruction
Abundantly clear was Mr Clarke's reliance on economic recovery to do the
bulk of the fiscal reconstruction. For he intends to go for growth. He will
set economic policy with the interest of business as well as the City in
mind. He will trumpet Britain's, and his own, successes loudly. It is a
little early for him to take the credit for the generally encouraging news
on unemployment, the monetary aggregates and inflation revealed this week or
worry about the sluggish performance of retail sales. But he will. 'We have
before us the prospect of several years of steady growth and rising
employment,' the chancellor said in Tuesday's speech.
But will it last? For populist chancellors tend to favour populist
recoveries. A lower exchange rate balanced by a tighter fiscal policy may be
the best way to ensure an investment and export-led recovery.
A lower exchange rate and a looser fiscal policy is much the better way to
encourage the kind of consumption-driven recovery which wins elections.
But will the chancellor be prepared to raise interest rates if wage
inflation accelerates, even in the run-up to the next election? Or is
another British inflationary cycle already assured? If the former, then,
Chancellor Clarke: 'all our hopes on thee are founded.' If the latter, then:
'Turn Back, Oh man, forswear thy foolish ways.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Man in the News: Full of beans and blarney - Tony O'Reilly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is long after midnight in a leafy Pittsburgh suburb, and Tony O'Reilly is
saying effusive goodnights.
The Dublin-born chairman of H J Heinz, the US food group, will have a few
hours' sleep, and then jet to Washington DC. There, he will defend the
group's Weight Watchers division before the Federal Trade Commission, which
is looking into weight loss claims. Next day, it will be on to New York for
his eldest son's wedding. After that, there are his newspapers in Ireland
and Australia to attend to, not to mention share stakes in Waterford
Wedgwood and Fitzwilton, the Irish mini-conglomerate. At some stage, he will
return to a 500-acre estate in County Kildare, where horse-breeding
interests beckon.
But for the past five hours, no one would have guessed this was a
businessman in a hurry. O'Reilly has commanded a dinner-table with an
outpouring of indiscreet anecdotes and Irish verbosity. Subjects have ranged
from the tunnel vision of bankers to the merits of inflation.
'Maynard Keynes and Jesus Christ,' he proclaims, 'were the two greatest men
in the past 2,000 years.' His second wife - Chryss Goulandris, a
Greek-American shipping heiress - quietly leaves the room, and returns with
emerald green badges designed by her husband to show to their guests. 'The
Deficit Doesn't Matter,' they declare.
Such is the life of Ireland's best-known executive export. The expansive bon
viveur, who started out as a rugby international and once auditioned for
Ben-Hur, juggles an exhausting array of private and public interests. This
has fascinated commentators for years. Can anyone successfully manage so
many competing demands, ask the sceptics. Or is everyone being fooled by
charming Irish blarney and shrewd self-promotion?
These questions have become more intense as the performance of Heinz has
stalled. This week, it said it would take a Dollars 192m charge to cover
cost-cutting. This resulted in a slide in operating profits, for the second
year running, to Dollars 860m, below the level of four years ago.
There has been speculation in the industry that O'Reilly, 57, has been
focusing on short term management goals, and that he might now be ready to
bail out of Heinz, after more than 20 years with the group.
O'Reilly entered the foods business early in his working life. The son of an
Irish customs officer, he studied law at University College, Dublin, but he
soon switched to business. At 26, he became head of the Milk Marketing Board
of Ireland, where he was credited with launching and promoting Kerrygold
butter, the successful export brand. O'Reilly moved on to manage a couple of
Irish food companies which did business with Heinz. The US company got to
know him and, to the surprise of many, tapped the 32-year-old Irishman to
head its UK business. Two years later, he was sitting in the Pittsburgh head
office.
He was named Heinz president in 1973 and became chief executive six years
later. In the early days, Heinz grew commendably. In the 1980s, earnings per
share virtually quadrupled. This was mainly because of vigorous pressure on
costs, international expansion and the success of its Weight Watchers
business. However, since 1990, the company has faced intense competition in
many main markets and profits growth has been an uphill battle.
At such times, some in the business wonder whether O'Reilly is spreading
himself too thinly. He has more than Dollars 150m tied up in other
businesses, mainly in Ireland. Only this week, it was announced that he
would become non-executive chairman of Waterford Wedgwood, the prestigious
but troubled ceramics and glasswear manufacturer, at the end of the year.
His investments, have not always performed smoothly. Most notorious is
Atlantic Resources, an oil exploration company founded in 1981 and headed by
O'Reilly. It was sold last year to Conroy Petroleum at 2p a share, from a
peak of IPounds 5.50, having never made a profit.
O'Reilly denies that his life outside Heinz is a distraction. Eighty per
cent of his time, he says, is devoted to the US company.
'I have a huge economic incentive,' he says, pointing to an option deal
struck in 1990 allowing him to buy 4m Heinz shares at just under Dollars 30
apiece in 1995. With the share price at Dollars 37, there is a current paper
profit of Dollars 28m. This might satisfy many people. But O'Reilly, who
already owns another 3m-plus shares, says not. 'Every Dollars 10 movement in
the share price is Dollars 72m. So you can hardly think of any better way to
spend your time, if you're being ruthlessly economic about it, than working
for Heinz.'
And money, he says, is only half the story. 'I have an enormous personal
commitment. Heinz was worth Dollars 900m when I took over in July 1979, and
now it's got a market capitalisation of Dollars 10bn. So I think I would
like to see this growth path resume. I think there is a disaffection which
the investment community has not just with food stocks, but with
disinflation. Usually you can get your growth out of price, volume and
costs. In these times, with a shell-shocked consumer, it's only possible to
get it out of volume and costs.'
He points out that Heinz has been facing price wars in about five main
business areas, from pet food to ketchup. In the 1980s, by contrast, it
largely avoided such skirmishes. But isn't juggling the portfolio of brands,
and pinpointing growth sectors, supposed to be the art of consumer products
management? After all, this is what O'Reilly did when he picked up Weight
Watchers for Dollars 71m in 1978.
'Well, critics can always say that,' he retorts, launching into a long
defence of Heinz's particular interests. 'But I feel mostly stimulated by
this present environment. I think the Heinz company has done a hell of a lot
of sensible things. But the task is not complete, and I see myself at Heinz
for at least another three years.'
Is running Heinz what gives him most pleasure? Mr O'Reilly pauses and
chuckles, but declines to go quite so far. 'There's a certain amount of
native pride,' he says, the Irish brogue thickening a little. 'It's where my
professional reputation rests.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Peace, but not at any price: Unprecedented demand for United
Nations forces has overstretched the world body's resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Events of the past week, in the tragedies of Bosnia and Somalia, cannot fail
to raise questions over the credibility of the peacekeeping capability of
the United Nations. In the past few years, after the end of the cold war,
the scale and the ambitions of UN peacekeeping efforts have rapidly
expanded. Some people dared to hope the organisation might at last be coming
into its own as the ultimate guarantor of the international system. But
these expectations, enormously puffed up by the spectacular eviction of Iraq
from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War, now look decidedly overdone and premature.
The danger now, at the end of a week in which UN aircraft have smashed
Mogadishu and Lord Owen has conceded that his Bosnia peace plan is dead, is
that the United Nations itself will be seriously discredited.
Part of the problem is the speed with which the United Nations' peacekeeping
ambitions have expanded. In the past four years, it has launched 14
peacekeeping operations, more than the total number set up in the previous
40 years. It is not just the number but the scale of these operations which
has increased, especially in the past two years. In the four years 1987-91
the numbers of soldiers involved averaged 10,000-15,000, but last year the
total rose to 48,000, plus another 15,000 police and civilians. It is now
considerably higher.
The most immediate consequence has been an exponential increase in costs. In
the first half of the 1980s, peacekeeping operations cost on average a
little over Dollars 200m a year; in 1988-91 the figure was Dollars 400m;
last year it was Dollars 1.4bn, and the total for the current two-year
period 1992-93 is scheduled at Dollars 3.6bn.
Part of the explanation is that some of the old UN peacekeeping operations,
launched decades ago, are still under way; they may still be performing a
modestly useful function, but they have not yet brought peace, and they have
not yet been wound up. This is particularly true of the Middle East, which
has been the object of six different peacekeeping missions, half of which
are still functioning after many years. In 1948, the UN sent a mission to
supervise the truce after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and it's still there.
In 1949, another mission was sent to observe the ceasefire in the conflict
over Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan, and it, too, is still
functioning.
But the real reason for the cost escalation is that, in the liberated era of
self-confidence after the cold war, the most recent UN peacekeeping
operations are both much larger and more ambitious than most of those in the
previous 20 years. Traditional operations, during most of the post-war
period, were deliberately low-key and non-confrontational. Typically, their
purpose was not to compel the end of a conflict. Rather their intention was
to help stabilise the wind-down of a conflict which was already being
brought to an end by the combatants - for example by monitoring a ceasefire.
The mandate for the 1973 Emergency Force mission, for monitoring the
ceasefire after the Arab-Iraeli war, is the classic definition of this kind
of role: the force must have the full consent and co-operation of all the
parties on the ground; it would only have weapons of a defensive character;
it would not use force except in self-defence; and it would operate on the
assumption that the parties to the conflict would comply with the decisions
of the UN Security Council.
This kind of low profile was not what the founding fathers of the UN had in
mind. The terms of its charter envisaged an altogether more muscular
approach. Under article 43, the Security Council would be empowered to take
virtually any measures to deal with a threat to the peace, including the use
of military force. All member governments would undertake to make armed
forces available to the council as required, and the council would be
advised by a Military Staff Committee made up of the chiefs of staff of the
permanent members of the council.
These ambitious plans were effectively neutralised by the cold war, though
not before the UN had made two spectacular and large-scale forays into the
peacekeeping business. The first was the Korean war of 1950, when it
authorised the mustering of an international coalition to repel the invasion
of South Korea by North Korea; but it was able to do so only because the
Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time.
Much more traumatic was the Congo operation of 1960, triggered by the
secession of Katanga and the deployment of Belgian troops to protect Belgian
nationals. This was voted by west and east for opposite motives: the
Americans supported the expedition because they feared the Soviet sympathies
of the new Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba; the Russians supported
the expedition because they suspected a western plot to recover control of
Katanga's copper resources. The expedition was a constant source of
east-west friction, which reached peaks of intensity with the murder of
Lumumba and the death in an air crash of Dag Hammarskjold, the UN
secretary-general.
After the confrontational trauma of the Congo operation, the UN kept its
head well below the parapet for the next 20 years. All peacekeeping
activities from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s were confined to small-scale
and consensual operations. Considering its modest ambitions, the 1973
Arab-Israeli ceasefire mission was quite a substantial peacekeeping
operation, which mustered between 4,000 and 7,000 men and cost Dollars 446m
over six years. More normal was the Arab-Israeli truce mission of 1948,
which is still functioning, and which consists of fewer than 300 men and
cost only Dollars 25m last year.
The turning point in UN peacekeeping came with the accession to power of
President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in 1985. His co-operative
posture permitted the organisation to take a higher profile. But the
subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union confronted the UN with a
series of unprecedented challenges to its peacekeeping role. The classic
problems in the 1960s and 1970s were conflicts between sovereign states.
Today's classic problem, by contrast, is the internal disintegration of
states, inter-ethnic conflict and civil war - such as in Yugoslavia, for
example, Cambodia and Angola.
This shift goes some way towards explaining why recent UN peacekeeping
operations are so large by historic standards. Monitoring a ceasefire
already agreed by two sovereign states is inherently much easier, and
militarily much less dangerous, than trying to sort out a civil war. The UN
force in Cambodia runs to 20,000 people, at a cost of Dollars 637m in 1992,
while the force in the former Yugoslavia totals more than 23,000 men, and
that in Somalia 28,000.
By the same token, however, the difficulty of the challenge partly explains,
but only partly, the very mixed results achieved so far. The Namibian
operation in 1989-90 was a spectacular success in supervising the transition
from a war of independence, through elections, to independence itself. But
the Angolan operation has so far been a lamentable failure: elections have
taken place, but the civil war goes on. In Cambodia, elections have been
held, and now everyone is holding his breath in the hope that a new
coalition hangs together.
The most difficult cases of all so far are provided by Somalia and what
remains of Yugoslavia, and it is here that UN credibility is really at
stake. In Somalia, it is difficult to discern whether the UN has a strategy,
or whether we are seeing a sequence of different tactics. Unless some
constructive strategy comes into view, it will be difficult to reconcile air
strikes with any normal concept of peacekeeping. In the former Yugoslavia,
the UN had a strategy of providing humanitarian aid, combined with economic
sanctions against the warring parties. Now it has an additional strategy of
providing 'safe havens' for the Moslems. But neither has been backed by
enough force to be implemented adequately, and neither is preventing the
military carve-up of Bosnia.
The evidence so far suggests that the UN is not yet really suited to dealing
with civil war and ethnic conflict. Almost by definition, the organisation
has to operate on the basis of a large measure of international consensus.
Intervention in civil war raises difficult questions: about the
circumstances in which the international community may have the right to
interfere in a sovereign state; and about the practical feasibility of
bringing a conflict to a stable and peaceful conclusion. The further the UN
ventures down the road of intervention and compulsion, the more essential,
and the more difficult, it becomes to devise a plausible political strategy
and to secure the necessary consensus.
As a result, we see the UN Security Council adopt contradictory policies: it
votes for safe havens in Bosnia, while knowing that it does not intend to
supply the necessary troops to protect them. UN official calculations are
that somewhere between 7,500 and 34,000 troops would be needed to protect
them. But so far member states have not volunteered even the smaller number;
and even the higher number would be too few in the absence of co-operation
from the warring parties. So far there has been no such co-operation.
This lack of commitment by the member states also shows up in the
peacekeeping budget. At the latest count, member states were Dollars 1.47bn
in arrears for all peacekeeping operations, of which Dollars 549m was owed
by the US and Dollars 91m by Russia.
Eighteen months ago, when the UN was buoyed up by its new-found confidence,
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general, called on member states to
implement the charter and activate Article 43, by making available stand-by
forces for the Security Council. His appeal fell on deaf ears: the world
community is not yet ready for such a step.
The final word has not yet been heard on the UN's peacekeeping role, nor
even on its role in Bosnia and Somalia. But the evidence so far is that
western governments are unwilling to venture far down the road of heavy
military intervention, and are anxious to ensure, by pre-emptive monitoring
and negotiation, that these two test cases are not repeated elsewhere.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Reviews put fresh doubts over capital's hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT step in the con-troversy over the restructuring of London's
hospitals will come next Wednesday with the publication of six reviews into
the distribution of specialist services in the capital.
The reviews into the future shape of London's specialist services were set
up by the government after the Tomlinson report, which proposed reducing the
capital's large number of teaching and specialist hospitals. Next week's
reports will, however, add to doubts over the future of hospitals that were
not directly threatened by Tomlinson.
The pressure group London Health Emergency, which yesterday published a
document containing findings from the reviews, expressed fears that the
recommendations could lead to nine hospitals closing and others finding
their financial positions undermined.
In addition to hospitals such as St Bartholomew's in the City, under threat
since the publication of the Tomlinson report last year, the pressure group
suggested that hospitals such as Oldchurch in Romford, the Brook in
Greenwich, Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon and Queen Elizabeth children's
hospital in Hackney will be at risk. London Health Emergency expects that
the reviews will propose to transfer specialist units lost in the closures,
but fears that in the present state of public spending policies there would
not be sufficient funds to finance such redevelopment.
The group said: 'The only certainty appears to be that a big reduction in
London hospital services is already under way, reinforced by the panic cuts
and closures imposed by the chaos of the internal market.'
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, stressed that the reviews, like
the Tomlinson report itself, would be treated as independent advice to the
government and not as government policy.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Spending cuts plea by Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT must make the case for tight controls on public expenditure,
so when difficult spending decisions are made they will be accepted as fair,
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
He told a meeting of Oxfordshire Conservatives that the need to curb
spending came not just from the longer-than-expected recession, but from the
fall in the number of workers in the population compared with the number of
pensioners, and from rising demands being made of public services.
Mr Hurd's intervention came a day after ministers agreed the toughest
spending limits for 15 years in an attempt to cut public borrowing, and
after prime minister Mr John Major urged colleagues to 'sing from the same
hymn sheet' on tax and manifesto commitments.
Mr Hurd said: 'When the time for decisions comes, in the autumn, they will
have to reflect clearly explained priorities, and they will have to be fair,
and be seen to be fair.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / CBI chief attacks London strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HOWARD Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
yesterday launched a stinging attack on the government's failure to
formulate a strategy for developing London as a leading European business
centre.
Speaking at a CBI conference on the future of the capital, Mr Davies accused
the cabinet sub-committee set up to co-ordinate policy on London of behaving
secretively and failing to involve others in its work.
'To most business people the establishment of the sub-committee has been a
non-event,' he said. 'It has been meeting for a year, or so I imagine. But
the UK's obsession for secrecy means that no one outside its close circle
knows what it has achieved, or what it hopes to achieve, or how it plans to
measure its performance in the future.'
Mr Davies also called for progress on improving transport in London,
including projects such as the extension of the Jubilee Underground line and
the CrossRail project. Both schemes have been delayed by the government's
desire to raise part of the cost through private sector finance.
'There is a danger that the whole government private-finance initiative will
be discredited unless real holes can be dug in the ground pretty soon,' he
said.
Earlier at the conference Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary,
said that he regarded London as a 'top priority'. He urged Londoners to
bring forward suggestions on improving the city, and said that he was
considering publishing a 'framework document' for the capital in the autumn.
This would 'celebrate our city, describe our achievements, reflect the views
of Londoners and throw out new ideas.'
Mr Davies said, however, that it was hard to be optimistic about London's
prospects in competing with other European cities. While business had
launched initiatives such as London First and London Forum to improve the
capital's infrastructure and promote it abroad, there was no overall
strategic body analysing London's problems and planning solutions.
It was clear, he said, that other European governments played a much greater
role in formulating strategic plans for developing their capital cities.
Mr Davies called on the sub-committee to publish an assessment of London's
strengths and weaknesses, and its plans for dealing with the latter. It
should be supported by a special office with staff from all the departments
with an interest in London, such as environment, trade and industry,
employment and transport.
The government should also improve its co-ordination with bodies such as
London First and the chambers of commerce, he said. It should support the
creation of a London centre to bring together initiatives such as London
Forum and the First Stop Shop for inward investors being developed by the
City Corporation, Westminster City Council and the London Docklands
Development Corporation.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Death meets environmental health: EC emission directives are
worrying the crematorium industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE LATEST round of environmental legislation comes into force, Britain's
crematorium business is facing its biggest shake-up for decades.
Almost all of Britain's 236 crematoria must, over the next five years,
replace or refit their 700 cremators - as the incinerators are discreetly
called - at an estimated cost of Pounds 80m to comply with new regulations
on industrial emissions.
The move has delighted Britain's tiny cremator making industry, provoked
bitter protests from crematorium operators, triggered a rapid rise in
cremation charges - and prompted many local authorities to reconsider the
management of their crematoria.
With a cremation rate of nearly 70 per cent - 90 per cent in London  -
Britain has the highest level of cremation in the Western world.
Mr Jon Luby, director of the Federation of British Crematorium Authorities,
said: 'Crematoria are not something that people usually notice. But it's a
very important service, and this is going to mean big changes.'
The turmoil in the normally sedate business has been prompted by the 1990
Environmental Protection Act. In accordance with European Community
directives on air pollution this requires crematoria to introduce stringent
monitoring and cut emissions by raising the temperature in their cremators
by 200 degrees to 850 degrees, lengthening each operation by several
seconds.
The Department of the Environment insists that these measures are needed to
reduce the gases - including chloride and carbon monoxide  - it believes are
emitted by cremators. 'In technical terms cremators are like any other
incinerator, so the industry has to be controlled like any business,' the
department said. Since crematoria tended to be in residential areas, the
risk from emissions was particularly high, it added.
Crematorium operators argue that the legislation is draconian, going far
beyond the EC requirements. They say it will be counter-productive in
environmental terms - the NIFES environmental consultancy group says
operating the cremators at higher temperatures will raise annual running
costs by Pounds 4m across the country in addition to the Pounds 80m
replacement costs, and use an extra 9m therms of gas.
Mr Luby said: 'The whole of the country's cremators don't emit as much
pollution as one Boeing aeroplane.'
With many local authorities unable to meet the cost of the capital
investment, estimated to be about Pounds 450,000 for most crematoria, which
on average have three cremators, most operators have responded to the
changes by levying an 'environmental surcharge'.
Since the introduction of the legislation, charges have risen by a third,
bringing the average cost of a cremation to Pounds 134 - still well below
the cost of funerals.
At the same time, many councils are considering another option - tendering
crematorium management out to the private sector.
Only 15 per cent of Britain's 236 crematoria are privately owned but the
number is rising, as companies such as Great Southern Group, which owns 11
crematoria, seek to expand their business.
Mr Eric Spencer, chief executive of Southern Group, said: 'It's a very
specialised business. You cannot go into it expecting an immediate return on
your capital investment.'
The company makes a Pounds 1.3m profit from the business each year. It opens
a new crematorium in Aberdeen next month.
For the moment the prospects for the business seem fairly healthy - after 50
years of rapid growth the cremation rate seems steady, while number of
deaths is predicted to rise by the end of the decade.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Fluoridation of water may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of govern-ment action to extend the fluoridation of water
supplies was raised by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary,
yesterday.
She will meet representatives of the Water Companies Association on July 7
and is expected to urge action to increase the number of people receiving
fluoridated water beyond the present 6m who are mainly around Birmingham.
Mrs Bottomley gave an indication of her intentions at the National
Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in Bournemouth
yesterday, when she said the time had come to look again at some of the
obstructions and difficulties.
She said in reply to a question that she would personally be outraged if she
did not have fluoridated water.
Next month's meeting will coincide with the first anniversary of the
government's Health of the Nation strategy, aimed at improving overall
health standards. Mrs Bottomley said the anniversary might be an appropriate
time to carry forward the fluoride issue.
Dental care is not one of the priority areas covered by the Health of the
Nation strategy. Mrs Bottomley might be tempted to make it one, using a
measure relating improved dental health to fluoridation.
Previous attempts to fluoridate water supplies have been fraught with
political and moral divisions over whether it is acceptable to medicate a
basic natural resource. Supporters argue that there is no evidence of risk
and that the policy should be pursued for its dental benefits.
Opponents say fluoridation denies individuals freedom of choice.
Mrs Bottomley's meeting will coincide with a programme in the BBC TV Nature
series in which Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, will question
Labour's traditional pro-fluoride position.
He will say that mass medication of water supplies is a 'very dangerous move
to make'.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Surge in orders for cremator makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL HAYWARD does not often reveal his profession at parties. But as one
of Britain's longest-established cremator makers he has reason to be
decidedly upbeat.
With Britain's crematoria due to replace their 700 cremators over the next
few years, the country's tiny cremator making business is experiencing a
boom.
Mr Hayward, cremator director of Cheshire-based Furnace Construction said:
'Britain has been leading the way in cremation and cremator making for some
time - this can only help.' The company, like the handful of other cremator
makers, is expecting orders to rise by at least 40 per cent next year.
Mr Hayward said that in the 50 years he had been in business his cremators
had changed considerably. When he started the cremation rate was only 10 per
cent. Now the rate is nearly 70 per cent, handling nearly 500,000
incinerations a year. The construction process demands extensive research
and development to cope with the demand for environmentally friendly,
computerised cremators.
As uncertainty over environmental legislation triggered a fall in domestic
demand during the 1980s cremator makers tried to expand overseas -
Australia, with a 47 per cent cremation rate, has been a fruitful market,
while Germany and the Netherlands have also been buyers. In Britain the
industry seems set for several years of steady expansion.
Mr Max Kingsland, chief executive of the cremator division of Evans
Universal, said: 'There aren't many industries where Britain is still strong
at home. But this is one of them.' His comapny has a turnover of about
Pounds 4m a year from its cremator business.

FT  19 JUN 93 / More doubts on London hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT STEP in the controversy over the restructuring of London's
hospitals will come next Wednesday with the publication of six reviews into
the distribution of specialist services in the capital.
The reviews into the future shape of London's specialist services were set
up by the government after the Tomlinson report, which proposed reducing the
capital's large number of teaching and specialist hospitals.
Next week's reports will, however, add to doubts over the future of
hospitals that were not directly threatened by Tomlinson.
The pressure group London Health Emergency, which yesterday published a
document containing findings from the reviews, expressed fears that the
recommendations could lead to nine hospitals closing and others finding
their financial positions undermined.
In addition to hospitals such as St Bartholomew's in the City, under threat
since the publication of the Tomlinson report last year, the pressure group
suggested that hospitals such as Oldchurch in Romford, the Brook in
Greenwich, Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon and Queen Elizabeth children's
hospital in Hackney will be at risk.
London Health Emergency expects that the reviews will propose to transfer
specialist units lost in the closures, but fears that in the present state
of public spending policies there would not be sufficient funds to finance
such redevelopment.
The pressure group said: 'The only certainty appears to be that a big
reduction in London hospital services is already under way, reinforced by
the panic cuts and closures imposed by the chaos of the internal market.'
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, stressed yesterday that it would
'be wrong to think that the recommendations of the reviews provide the
definitive blueprint for the future'.
The reviews, like the Tomlinson report itself, would be treated as
independent advice to the government and not as government policy.
Further rationalisation in London is likely to be proposed next month when
another review of the capital's specialist post-graduate hospitals is
published.
Final decisions on hospital services in the capital are likely to be made by
ministers by the end of the year.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Question raised on income products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIDELITY, the fund management group, has written to the Securities and
Investments Board expressing concern about the way some high-income products
are marketed, Philip Coggan writes.
The concerns relate to products which offer a 'guaranteed' income, often at
levels as high as 10 per cent. These products can appear highly attractive
to investors dissatisfied with building society returns in the wake of the
fall in base rates to 6 per cent.
While the income is guaranteed on these products, however, return of the
initial capital is not. On some products the stockmarket is required to grow
at a defined rate for the original investment to be returned. Investors
could easily find that the 'income' had been earned only at the expense of
their capital, for no real gain at all. Fidelity is worried that the use of
the term 'income' in relation to these products may be misleading and that
the risks should be made clear to investors.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Stock exchange calls for regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ANDREW Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has called for
the creation of a single enforcement agency with the power to bring criminal
and civil charges in cases of market manipulation.
In the exchange's report for the year ended March 31 this year Sir Andrew
said that amid growing public concern about market manipulation 'it is not
widely recognised how limited are the exchange's powers nor how much
valuable work we do to monitor and detect irregularities.'
Sir Andrew's call comes just weeks after the City's chief watchdog, the
Securities and Investments Board, issued a review of its own powers. It
concluded that such an enforcement body, with a greatly increased
surveillance capacity, may be necessary.
The exchange and the SIB have both called for the creation of a surveillance
mechanism which would allow regulators to track all equity-related
transactions, including those in underlying derivative instruments which are
now not captured by enforcement authorities.
Sir Andrew said in the annual report: 'Unless market regulators have access
to all this information their chances of detecting clever financial crooks
will diminish.'
On other matters Sir Andrew said the Stock Exchange intended to spend about
Pounds 40m over the next two and a half years to build a successor to the
outdated SEAQ price display system.
The exchange has already spent about Pounds 7.5m in planning the system,
which had been the subject of opposition from some members who favoured
asking the US-based National Association of Securities Dealers to build a
system for it.
Some members had suggested that the exchange's inability to make its Taurus
paperless settlement system work raised questions about its ability to build
a cost-effective successor to SEAQ.
Sir Andrew said IBM Consulting had been retained to act as an independent
monitor of progress on the project in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of
Taurus.
The annual report noted that the exchange suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds
11.9m for the year which ended in March, against a profit of Pounds 1.5m the
year before, as it absorbed the costs of closing down its Taurus paperless
settlement project.
Sir Andrew pointed to a reduction in the exchange's operating costs and
said: 'We dont regard ourselves as being judged by the amount of money we
make.' He said the current year's earnings should see a substantial
improvement.
The annual report says the exchange's review of its Yellow Book, its rules
governing the admission of securities, would be published this summer and
there would be an interval of at least two months before the new rules came
into effect.
It says 112 companies were suspended and there were 134 cancellations of
listing during the year, mainly at the request of the companies involved.
During the year the exchange's market supervision department conducted more
than 295 investigations into possible breaches of trading and reporting
rules and 10 cases were referred to disciplinary panels.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Department of Employment yesterday said emigration could be a 'small'
factor in the fall in unemployment, David Goodhart writes. Officials were
responding to a GMB general union study which shows a 30 per cent fall in
the number of Irish nationals in Britain.
The study, based on the department's Labour Force Survey, shows the number
of Irish nationals fell from 640,613 in April 1990 to 460,721 in November
last year. Those unemployed fell from 35,511 to 31,984.
Mr Paul Kenny, GMB London secretary, said: 'These figures show the
devastating impact of recession on the Irish population over here. Families
have either moved to Ireland or to third countries.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / The softly-softly approach to closing down the pits: Michael
Smith looks at the lessons in subtlety the government has learnt in its
handling of the mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TACTICS are as subtle now as they were previously clumsy. The
government's move to close three pits it reprieved in March demonstrates
that it has learnt from the public relations disaster of nine months ago,
when it attempted to shut three fifths of Britain's mining industry.
Last October the government was forced to withdraw hastily its plans to
close 31 pits. It had tried to achieve too much at once and, some
corporation executives feel, drawn needless public and parliamentary
attention.
This time, through its agent British Coal, the government has adopted a
softly-softly approach. Twelve pits reprieved in March as a result of the
public furore that followed October's announcement are, it seems, to be
closed in stages and, the government hopes, without fuss.
The first three - Rufford in Nottinghamshire, Markham in Derbyshire and an
unnamed third - have already been earmarked for closure and the chances are
most of the rest will follow in the next year.
In marked contrast to October's approach British Coal will not publicise its
plans. Closure proposals will be put to the workforce for approval, instead
of being presented as a fait accompli. British Coal headquarters will not
make public announcements before any workforce decisions.
The speed with which the government has moved to close mines it reprieved
less than three months ago may surprise the public, but few in the industry
have been taken aback. Although the March white paper gave a stay of
execution for the 12 pits - and for a further six that are being mothballed
 -the government did little to make room in the market for their output.
In the 10 weeks since then, market conditions have deteriorated
significantly. The improved efficiency of nuclear power plants and a move by
the Pollution Inspectorate to enforce tighter controls on coal-fired power
stations have reinforced the elec-tricity generators' lack of enthusiasm for
buying coal.
If the dozen reprieved pits are to be kept alive British Coal needs to sell
at least an extra 12m tonnes of coal this year and more still in 1994-5,
when the tonnages required under existing contracts fall. Developments of
the past few months make that an impossible task. British Coal will be lucky
to secure 8m tonnes more in each year.
In asking the workforces at Rufford and Markham to approve closure British
Coal is stressing the role of unfavourable geological factors which, it
says, will limit the pits' lives. But local officials are also emphasising
the marketing conditions.
More influential on the mineworkers' thinking is the government's notice
that it intends to end in December a scheme that allows miners at redundant
pits to transfer to other mines and gives them enhanced severance terms if
they decide to leave the industry altogether.
That will encourage the miners to consider leaving. Meanwhile, those who
want to stay on will probably not be able to depend on Conservative
politicians coming to their rescue as they did in October.
Conservative MPs will be given a chance to vote against the government only
if Labour uses one of its supply days to force a debate. The government,
buoyed by its more pragmatic, gradualist strategy, believes that it would
still win the day.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Two wise men want Treasury to boost training funds: Advisers
likely to be divided on how to cut PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY will be told on Monday by two of its panel of outside economic
advisers to earmark more funds for training and investment, in a move which
could jar with the attempt to cut the government's Pounds 50bn budget
deficit.
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, and Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at investment bank Goldman
Sachs, link training funds to the need to boost Britain's industrial
strength and lay the foundations for long-term growth.
The meeting of the Treasury's so-called seven wise men is likely to be
divided over whether the government should favour tax increases or spending
cuts as the main weapon to bring down state borrowing.
Several of the advisers see regaining control of the deficit as vital to
helping a solid upturn.
Any tax rises would come on top of the Pounds 17bn worth of tax increases
announced in the March Budget to take effect in the three financial years to
1995-96.
Monday's gathering will take place privately between the seven economists
and senior Treasury officials led by Mr Alan Budd, chief economic adviser.
It is their first meeting since Mr Kenneth Clarke took over as chancellor
last month from Mr Norman Lamont, who set up the panel at the end of last
year. A report written by Treasury officials that summarises the group's
proposals and forecasts is due to be sent to Mr Clarke the week after next.
The panel's discussion will be the first since Professor Tim Congdon, a
staunch monetarist who is one of the group, criticised his colleagues'
understanding of economics in an open letter published in March.
Mr Britton said the government needed to increase funds for training and
investment in areas such as transport, while cutting back where possible on
social security spending and other areas which did not contribute to
economic growth.
While Mr Britton feels further tax increases are not necessary, Mr Davies
would like to see tax increases phased in during the next four years 'to pay
for a shift of resources' into areas of public spending that will help
industrial growth.
Mr Davies said the tax increases, combined with possible cuts in public
spending, should add up to a fiscal tightening that would total about Pounds
12bn by 1997.
Prof Congdon, economic adviser to the Gerrard and National discount house,
also wants tax rises to curb the budget deficit. But he is not in favour of
plans to shift government resources into investment or training, arguing the
private sector should take the lead on such decisions.
Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British
Industry, and Liverpool University's Prof Patrick Minford both want spending
cuts to bear the brunt of the effort to bring down borrowing.
Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, another panel member, said he
preferred not to state a view prior to the meeting. Prof David Currie of the
London Business School, the seventh wise man, did not return telephone
calls.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Lawson issues warning to Clarke: Common cause for Thatcher
era adversaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO ERSTWHILE adversaries of the Thatcher era found common cause yesterday,
advising Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, on how to shape his
policies.
And Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor until a few weeks ago, this morning warns
that government policy could be throwing away Britain's chances of economic
recovery.
Lord Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, who as former chancellor and a key
government adviser disagreed openly during the latter years of Mrs (now
Lady) Thatcher's term, yesterday delivered separate warnings over Mr
Clarke's stance at the Treasury.
Lord Lawson denounced any shift towards a 'go for growth' policy. He said
'no sudden burst of growth can produce anything other than a spurt of
inflation'.
Sir Alan launched a direct attack on Mr Clarke. He said on the BBC that Mr
Michael Howard or Mr Michael Portillo should have replaced Mr Norman Lamont
as chancellor. Mr Clarke would spend public money to avoid political
problems.
He added: 'I doubt whether he has the sort of spine needed to control the
books.'
Lord Lawson, as chancellor, once said that there had been an economic
miracle, and pushed the annual rate of growth to 5.1 per cent in early 1988.
Last week he was implicitly blamed for Britain's recent economic
difficulties by Mr Lamont, who claimed in his resignation speech that the
recession of the early 1990s had its origins in the boom of 1988 and 1989.
Lord Lawson, speaking at a seminar arranged by the investment managers
Capital House, said cycles were the normal pattern of economic behaviour.
But he warned of persistent inflationary dangers. 'The dragon of inflation
is asleep but is not dead.' he said. 'It is highly likely to waken up
again.'
Mr Lamont, writing in today's Daily Mail, says government borrowing is 'far
too high' and has to be curbed if Britain is to capitalise on falling
unemployment and stable inflation.
He felt 'pride and pleasure' when he heard that the policies he had put in
place had resulted in this week's fall in unemployment figures.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Stock Exchange calls for curb on manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ANDREW Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has called for
the creation of a single enforcement agency with the power to bring criminal
and civil charges in cases of market manipulation.
In the exchange's report for the year to March 31 Sir Andrew said that amid
growing public concern about market manipulation 'it is not widely
recognised how limited are the exchange's powers nor how much valuable work
we do to monitor and detect irregularities'.
The exchange has called for the creation of a surveillance mechanism which
would allow regulators to track all equity-related transactions, including
those in underlying derivative instruments which are now not captured by
enforcement authorities.
Separately, Sir Andrew said the exchange intended to spend about Pounds 40m
in the next two-and-a-half years to build a successor to the outdated SEAQ
price display system.
The exchange has already spent about Pounds 7.5m planning SEAQ, which had
been the subject of opposition from some members. It had been said that the
exchange's inability to make its Taurus paperless settlement system work
raised questions about its ability to build a cost-effective SEAQ successor.
Sir Andrew said IBM Consulting had been retained to act as a monitor of
progress on the project in an effort to avoid the Taurus pitfalls.
The annual report noted that the exchange suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds
11.9m for the year which ended in March, against a profit of Pounds 1.5m the
year before, as it absorbed the costs of closing down Taurus.
During the year the exchange conducted more than 295 investigations into
possible breaches of trading and reporting rules and 10 cases were referred
to disciplinary panels.
The report confirmed that Mr Peter Rawlins, who resigned in March as Stock
Exchange chief executive after the failure of the Taurus project, was paid
Pounds 348,530 in the year to March 31 (Pounds 272,584 in the previous
year). He also received Pounds 174,500 compensation for loss of office,
including a car worth Pounds 9,500.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Science minister pressed on research spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS ABOUT whether Mr William Waldegrave, the science minister, has the
political clout to ensure that money saved through cuts in military research
and development is switched to civil projects were expressed from both sides
of the Commons yesterday.
Mr Waldegrave, in opening a debate on the recently published white paper on
government expenditure on science and technology, called for the redoubling
of efforts to ensure that the money was spent 'properly and where it really
matters'. To that end he announced that a new council for science and
technology would be established by the end of October.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow science minister, said the Office of Public
Service and Science headed by Mr Waldegrave was not 'strong enough' to
effectively co-ordinate the science spending of all government departments.
She emphasised that other departments remained responsible for 60 per cent
of government spending on science and technology - including 40 per cent by
the Ministry of Defence.
Sir Giles Shaw, the Conservative chairman of the Commons science and
technology committee, agreed that the biggest problem facing Mr Waldegrave
was how to deal with the MoD. He said: 'Savings made in defence research and
development must be transferred to the civil side.'
Sir Giles also pressed for more spending by the Department of Trade and
Industry on civil research and development, and greater efforts to secure
the support of shareholders and the City for such expenditure.
Mr Robert Jackson, the former junior science minister who played a role in
producing the white paper on science spending, said the paper had been a
'missed opportunity' to cut spending on defence research and development.
Too much scarce scientific talent and 'brain power' had been absorbed into
defence work, he said, instead of being diverted into more economically
useful civilian projects.
Mr Lewis Moonie, shadow junior science spokesman, suggested that civil
research and development could be expanded by giving companies 'tax credits'
to finance specific projects.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Anger among backbenchers over pit closures unlikely to lead
to revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGER AMONG Tory backbenchers over the latest pit closures is unlikely to
result in any significant revolt in the Commons, Ivor Owen writes.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, who was one of the four Tory
MPs who voted against the government when the issue was debated in March,
yesterday directed her main criticism at British Coal.
She accused it of not doing enough to take advantage of the subsidies
offered by the government when it sought to secure a reprieve for 12 of the
pits threatened with closure.
Mrs Peacock said she intended to contact Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, to discuss whether the government could take any further
action.
Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, who abstained in
the March vote, said he would have gone into the lobby against the
government had he known how the situation would develop.
He criticised Mr Heseltine for failing to exert his authority by 'telling
the generators that they must not run down their coal stocks'.
Any further opportunity for MPs to vote on pit closures is likely to arise
only if the shadow cabinet decides to initiate a debate on the issue.

FT  19 JUN 93 / SFO seeks access to Nadir banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is seeking Turkish government co-operation to allow
access to the books of two Istanbul-based banks connected to Mr Asil Nadir,
the fugitive businessman.
The proposal was discussed last week with the Turkish government in meetings
with Ms Lorna Harris, the chief SFO lawyer dealing with fraud charges
relating to the affairs of Mr Nadir's former company, Polly Peck
International.
Legal experts in Ankara have confirmed that the UK has requested Turkish
assistance under the terms of a letter rogatory, under which a court in one
country can seek the co-operation of a court in another jurisdiction in an
investigation of a suspect. If the Turks agree, this would also allow the
SFO to interview key witnesses in Turkey relating to the affair.
The SFO is understood to have issued similar requests to a number of
countries where Mr Nadir had business interests, including the US and the
Cayman Islands.
The letter rogatory would allow SFO access to the records of both Impexbank,
the Istanbul merchant bank Mr Nadir sold in 1990, and Turkiye Yatirim Turizm
TYT bank to which Mr Nadir has also been linked. Mr Nadir is believed to
have channelled large sums out of PPI to these two banks using the accounts
of his mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir.
There is a diplomatic effort to dissuade Mr Nadir from travelling to the
Turkish mainland from northern Cyprus where he fled on May 5. He says he
wants to go there to reclaim his business empire.

FT  19 JUN 93 / New commitments to mortgages fall: House prices constant,
say societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of home buyers making commitments to new mortgages from building
societies fell last month as further evidence emerged that the housing
market recovery remains modest.
The Building Societies Association published figures showing that net new
commitments to mortgages fell 12 per cent in May to Pounds 2.78bn, from
Pounds 3.18bn in April. The fall followed three consecutive monthly rises.
The association also disclosed that its own index of house prices shows that
prices remained constant in the first quarter of the year compared to the
last quarter of last year, and were 6 per cent down on the first quarter of
that year.
Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general elect, said the figures
indicated that the housing market was 'not taking off' but was nonetheless
recovering from the 'very depressed' conditions of the last quarter of 1992.
The figures do not include lending by banks or other mortgage lenders -
although Abbey National is included in the house price index. Banks have
been raising their share of mortgage lending over the past six months.
Societies achieved a net inflow of retail funds from savers of Pounds 700m,
a fall from April's Pounds 1.07bn but far higher than inflows in the first
three months. Societies last year achieved a net inflow of only Pounds 295m
for the whole year.
Mr Coles said retail inflows had been 'surprisingly robust' in the year so
far, in sdpite of fears of competition from National Savings and equity
products. Societies have gained Pounds 2.5bn so far, compared with Pounds
657m for the same period last year.
Mr Coles warned, however, that the forthcoming sale of British Telecom
shares would 'severely distort' inflows in coming months as savers withdrew
funds to buy shares. He said this effect would start to occur at the end of
June.
The house-price figures show that the heaviest falls between the first
quarter of this year and the same period of 1992 occurred in Greater London
(8 per cent), the south-east (9 per cent) and the south-west (11 per cent).
The house price index - which is based on a value of 100 in 1985 - reached a
peak of 201 in the third quarter of 1990 before falling. It rose marginally
in the third quarter of last year before falling to 182.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Charges over blast deaths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON &amp; WELCH, the chemicals manufacturer, was yesterday committed for
trial at Leeds Crown Court on charges connected with an explosion last year
at its plant in Castelford, West Yorkshire, in which five workers were
killed and two were seriously injured.
The company faces charges, brought by the Health and Safety Executive, of
failing to ensure the safety of employees under section 2 of the Health and
Safety at Work Act.
The company's solicitor agreed to the lifting of reporting restrictions on
yesterday's hearing before Pontefract magistrates.
Mr Michael Elliker, prosecuting, said the blast happened as workers cleaned
out a tank containing a hazardous residue sludge. It was the first time in
20 years that the tank had been cleaned. He said they heated the sludge and
cleaned it out using a dangerous method.

FT  19 JUN 93 / May rise in M4 points to expanding economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the M4 measure of the money supply last month has supported
notions that the economy is gradually expanding.
M4, which includes deposits at banks and building societies and notes and
coins, rose a seasonally-adjusted 3.9 per cent in the year to May, the Bank
of England said.
The year-on-year increase in the aggregate was the highest since November
last year. In the 12 months to April the rise was 3.5 per cent.
Other figures from the Bank fail to give the impression that lending by
banks and building societies is set for rapid growth.
Banks and societies last month lent Pounds 1.9bn in sterling to companies
and individuals, after Pounds 2.9bn in April.
Separately, the British Bankers' Association said lending by the big UK
banks came to a net Pounds 1.15bn in May, after Pounds 2.47bn the previous
month. In March and April the average monthly rise was just Pounds 733m.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said that while total
lending had picked up since the start of the year 'it is from a low level
and at a very slow pace'.
While demand for mortgage loans from the big banks has recently been strong,
companies repaid debt in May for the fourth month running.
This in part reflects a desire to repay loans run up during the mid to
late-1980s. Companies have also had less need to take on new loans as
government borrowing has soared.
The Treasury said: 'The improvement in broad money growth over recent months
is consistent with evidence of a resumption of growth across the economy.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Political paralysis looms over G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S political crisis could not have come at a more sensitive time for
its international economic relations.
With a general election due in late July, the country will be in the midst
of the election campaign when Tokyo hosts the summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrialised starting on July 7.
That week Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, is due to sign an
agreement with US President Bill Clinton on a framework for Japan and the US
to negotiate trade disputes.
The prospects for the Gatt world trade talks have also been hurt. The
Japanese government, fearful of being punished in the polls, will be in no
position to deliver concessions for the sake of a Gatt agreement at the
summit.
The immediate consequence of the no-confidence vote will be paralysis of the
government. Mr Miyazawa has become a lame duck and all major decisions will
be put off during the campaign. The election itself could yield a weak,
LDP-led coalition government.
In the short run the main beneficiaries of the crisis may be Japan's
powerful bureaucrats, who will have more scope to act on their own
initiative. But in the medium run the bureaucrats can only work effectively
if strong politicians are on hand to take big decisions, for instance over
whether the ailing Japanese economy needs more stimulus or what concessions
to make on agriculture for the sake of the Gatt talks.
The summit may not be too damaged because plans for its agenda are already
fairly well advanced. Indeed a successful summit would strengthen the LDP's
claim to be the only party capable of representing Japan on the world stage.
However, the ageing Mr Miyazawa is likely to look weak next to the
relatively youthful Mr Clinton and the new Canadian prime minister Ms Kim
Campbell.
Japan's bilateral meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin may be
particularly troubling, as Mr Yeltsin is likely to make clear Japan should
not expect concessions in the dispute with Russia over the Kurile islands
north of Japan. Rough treatment from Mr Yeltsin would be a further
humiliation for Mr Miyazawa.
As for the talks with the US, foreign ministry officials are confident the
outline framework for trade negotiations can be agreed by officials. But
substantive talks on specific issues such as opening up the market for
supercomputers or car parts will have to be shelved.
In addition US calls for further stimulus for the Japanese economy will only
be met by a strong government capable of overcoming the finance ministry's
opposition to more government pump priming.
The same is true of the Gatt talks. Tokyo will next week host a meeting of
trade ministers from the EC, the US and Canada. It was widely hoped this
would deliver an agreement on market access measures. That may be more
difficult now. But what can certainly be ruled out in the near future is any
Japanese concessions on its rice import ban, which is the main Japanese
obstacle to a Gatt deal.
The LDP needs all the support it can get. Its unwillingness to support
political reform may well have antagonised young urban voters. The last
thing it will want to do is to alienate its traditional rural supporters as
well.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Miti reluctant to brake harder on car exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is prepared to talk to the European Community about the level of its
car exports to the EC, but has made clear it believes the deterioration in
the European market this year does not necessarily call for a cut in
Japanese exports.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has drafted a letter to Mr
Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, agreeing to discuss the Japanese
monitoring of car exports to the EC this year.
But the Japanese side signalled it was not yet prepared to lower the level
of car exports to the EC. Neither do Japanese authorities intend to change
the status of cars manufactured in the EC by Japanese vehicle makers.
Japanese officials accept that the European market situation has
deteriorated more than was expected when the 1993 export level was agreed in
March.
'But it is difficult to tell what will happen in the second half of the
year,' a Miti official said. 'If the situation is looked at objectively, it
may well be that the first half of 1993 was the bottom of the downturn and
that the market will pick up in the second half.'
There is strong opposition in the trade ministry and industry to recent
suggestions from EC car makers that cars manufactured at Japanese transplant
factories, which are not covered by the EC-Japan deal but are 'taken into
consideration' under it, should be included in the monitored figures.
'Cars manufactured locally by Japanese companies are EC cars,' the Miti
official said. 'It is absolutely clear that that was what was agreed in the
EC-Japan agreement on the monitoring of motor vehicle exports from Japan to
the EC.'
Earlier this month, Mr Bangemann wrote to Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade and
industry minister, asking for urgent talks aimed at revising a deal reached
in April in which Japan agreed to reduce exports of cars and light
commercial vehicles by 9.4 per cent to roughly 113,000 vehicles.
The agreement in April was based on an EC forecast that car sales in the
Community would decline by 6.5 per cent this year. But new vehicle
registrations in the first four months of the year dropped by as much as
17.8 per cent and the industry estimates that the figure could be 15 per
cent for the year as a whole.

'IS IT really true? I hope it is,' exclaimed a Tokyo office worker last
night after hearing that the vote of no-confidence in the government had
been passed by parliament's lower house. 'I'm surprised, but this is the way
it should have been,' beamed another middle-aged office worker heading home
from the Ginza, the neon-covered night spot in central Tokyo.
While most Japanese have been complacent about the behaviour of the
country's tightly-knit political sphere, the recent turmoil has managed to
grab the attention of the usually apathetic electorate. 'I'm shocked to hear
the news, but I don't know who I'll vote for yet,' said student Miss Rieko
Kojima, 20.
The tax evasion scandal which broke late last year involving Mr Shin
Kanemaru, former kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, angered
ordinary Japanese. Frustration has mounted especially among office workers,
who are feeling the effects of the downturn in the economy through cuts in
bonuses, overtime pay and who fear the demise of the life-time employment
system.
Mr Hideo Ichikawa, a 36-year-old office worker, was not shy to hide his
anger. 'Of course Mr Miyazawa has to take responsibility. We salarymen are
sick of all this.' Mr Susumu Sugisaka, 32, a banker said: 'The LDP are
useless. I'll never vote for them again.'
However, many voters still doubt that the LDP's power base will crumble. Mr
Hisayoshi Yamashita, a taxi driver, does not believe that any party other
than the LDP will rule the country, but has voted for the socialist party
all his life 'just to keep a balance.' And although many Japanese are turned
off by the LDP, there are few realistic alternatives.
Even Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister who was at the centre of
yesterday's turmoil, is regarded with some reserve. 'They may seem to be
saying different things, but fundamentally they're probably the same,' said
Mr Tadamitsu Yamasaki, 55, a doctor. 'Is he really going to bring in
change?' asked one office worker, while a brokerage official raised doubts
over Mr Hata's partnership with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a Kanemaru follower turned
reformer.
And while some office workers, especially after their cups of sake in the
Ginza, last night remained as apathetic as ever, others indicated that they
may not be too eager to give up the current stability for fundamental
political changes. 'As long as the economy doesn't get really bad, I'm happy
to vote for the LDP as long as they repent their corrupt ways,' said a
42-year-old real estate agent.
Relationships which have been nurtured over the years are also not going to
diminish immediately. 'I'm going to vote for the LDP candidate,' said a
62-year-old shop owner. 'I've known and voted for him for 20 years.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / Japan's Political Crisis: A faint smile as the knife goes in
 -Robert Thomson observes a polite betrayal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tsutomu Hata smiled faintly last night as he took centre stage in the
Japanese parliament and voted against his party to bring down the
government.
Before throwing in his lot with the opposition last night, Mr Hata, 58,
bowed to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who sat sad-faced as the
betrayal was played out in front of him.
For a party rebel who has torn at the Liberal Democratic Party's seams, and
was on the verge of creating a rival party last night, Mr Hata is
mild-mannered and polite.
When the time came to justify his actions, he spoke without a sense of
elation, preferring to emphasise that the decision was not easily taken.
'It is a very difficult thing to have done,' he said. 'But we have reached a
turning point in Japanese politics and the pressure for change is intense.
What path we will take is something that our faction must now discuss.'
Mr Hata draws his confidence from the perception that he represents the
aspirations of ordinary Japanese. He is self-consciously populist, and has
appeared on television in the company of showgirls and comedians, all in the
interests of political reform.
Having worked at a bus company for 10 years before entering politics, he
dubbed himself the 'salaried worker MP' to distinguish himself from the
career politicians and the sons of career politicians who dominate the
ruling party.
The image developed during a term as agriculture minister, when he
cultivated the farm vote by touring the provinces, insisting that the rice
market would be permanently closed to imports. His rural home town is in
central Japan, and he felt at ease in the company of farmers.
The coming election will test whether his perceptions of his political
faction's role as the representative of the people are correct.
It may be difficult for some Japanese to ignore the company he keeps. By
Japanese political standards, Mr Hata is clean, but his colleague Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general, is known as a backroom manipulator.
Mr Ozawa has provided the numbers to give the Hata faction substance, but
the credibility of his recent conversion to the cause of reform will be an
issue during the election. Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata share a building in central
Tokyo, but they lead separate lives, one still working behind the scenes,
and the other working the Japanese media.
The 34 faction members who joined Mr Hata in voting against the LDP are an
odd collection, the pro-reform remnants of a larger faction which split late
last year. There are the elders whose ruddy faces tell of late-night
drinking and bargaining sessions, and for whom the events of last night are
an unexpected thrill near the end of long careers.
And there are the younger members, noticeably nervous when they arrived at
Hata headquarters yesterday morning for the meeting at which they
collectively decided to vote against the LDP. They will be vulnerable at the
election now that they have left the comfortable hierarchy of the LDP, which
would have delivered ministerial posts after a few more terms in office.
Mr Hata is hoping for defections from other LDP factions in coming days to
enlarge and strengthen his faction. Then he will need to gather the funds
necessary to compete with the extensive resources of established factions,
which is where the well-connected Mr Ozawa is supposed to come in.
In the past, the LDP's factions have generally not been divided by ideology,
but they have bickered over sharing the spoils of power. Mr Hata is also no
ideologue. He believes in free trade, and the creation of a more transparent
government.
He has repeatedly argued that changes to the electoral system would only be
the first stage of change, and should lead to an upheaval of the present
political parties and the creation of a parliamentary system more responsive
to emerging issues and less focused on factional whim.
'Reform will help to raise the people's awareness of politics. Reform will
help to nurture real political parties, and it will help Japan to develop a
more independent foreign policy and to take diplomatic initiatives,' he said
this week.
These are observations which play well in urban Japan, where dissatisfaction
with the LDP is greatest. But the salaried worker MP could find that the
most infertile political fields are those of rural Japan, where the support
for the LDP is strongest and the vested interests run deep.

economy

THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese economy may have bottomed out in the first
quarter of this year after a prolonged period of weakness, according to
government figures released yesterday.
Real gross national product in the first three months of the year grew at an
annual rate of 2.3 per cent, supported by a strong rise in domestic demand,
the Economic Planning Agency said.
Gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at an annual rate of 2.7
per cent.
On a quarterly basis GNP rose 0.6 per cent from the previous quarter, while
GDP was up 0.7 per cent.
Meanwhile, broad money supply for May rose a strong 1.5 per cent
year-on-year.
This was the strongest growth in money supply since the first quarter of
last year and comes after a long period of weak or negative money supply
growth.
Money supply growth has been negative in the months since September last
year, excluding February and April of this year when money supply rose 0.1
per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.
Mr Shunji Fukinbara, deputy director-general of the Economic Planning
Agency, welcomed the rise in the GDP figures, which he said supported the
agency's report earlier this month that the economy had hit bottom.
The strong rise in the money supply, however, reflected the government's
efforts to stimulate the economy rather than a significant pick-up in
domestic economic activity.
A Bank of Japan official noted that the increase in the money supply in May
was largely due to fiscal factors, such as the fall in tax payments to the
government.
The rise in GNP was supported by a strong 6.5 per cent increase in public
spending, although private consumption also rose 1.2 per cent over the
previous quarter, largely as a result of increased spending on cars and
other durable goods.
However, weak demand for vehicles in April and May, when sales fell 10 per
cent, suggest that the rise in private consumption may not be sustained.
Private residential investment also continued to be weak, marking a decline
of 3.0 per cent. Real exports showed a slight decline.
Fiscal 1992 as a whole showed the lowest growth rate in 18 years - since the
Japanese economy contracted 0.2 per cent in fiscal 1974, just after the
first oil crisis. GNP was up only 0.8 per cent, compared with the
government's target of 1.6 per cent.
The annual GNP growth rate for fiscal 1992 compares with a growth rate of
3.3 per cent in 1991 and 5.3 per cent in 1990.
The Bank of Japan has revised downward the year-on-year increase in the
money supply for April from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Serbs to vote on new mini-state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VUKOVAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Milorad Visic, mayor of the devastated town of Vukovar, sees the weekend
referendum in the self-styled state of Serbian Krajina, in Croatia, as a
crucial step in carving out a Serbian state.
An overwhelming majority of voters is expected to cast ballots in favour of
the union of Serb-held parts of Croatia with Serb-held parts of Bosnia.
Boasting that he is a nationalist, Mr Visic says the referendum will help to
cement a Serbian state for Serbs and not for other ethnic groups.
Encouraged by the inability of the international community to stop the
ethnic division of Bosnia, Mr Visic believes his mini-state will benefit
from what he calls the new-found realism in the west.
'Let the west make Vukovar the capital of the new Serbian state,' he says,
calling the referendum the most important event since the 'liberation' of
Vukovar.
'Other nationalities are not equal to Serbs in this state. The Croats can
have their own state but not on our territory,' he says of his 'republic',
which covers nearly one-third of Croatia.
The 33-year-old mayor of the once picturesque Baroque town set on the banks
of the River Danube is not alone in his opinions.
He seems to express sentiments shared by most of the inhabitants of the
burned-out town in eastern Croatia.
Colourful referendum posters remind voters: 'One state, one wish, one
nation.'
Mr Visic says the week-end poll will be a key step in institutionalising the
union of some 2m Serbs outside Serbia. He criticises Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic for wanting to unite all Serbs in a state in which other
ethnic groups have equal rights.
Asked if he envisages a union with neighbouring Serbia, Mr Visic says: 'This
will come later. Serbia will unite with us once it solves the problem of
Kosovo,' in reference to the mostly Albanian province in southern Serbia.
'They must either give it away or beat the Albanians the way we did the
Croats,' he laughs.
He believes the poll will stop Mr Milosevic from making deals with Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman.
'He does not have the right to play with our fate or trade our land,' Mr
Visic says, amid speculation that the leaders of Serbia and Croatia plan to
swap territory in exchange for peace.

<TEXT>
A CANADIAN peacekeeper was killed yesterday when an anti-tank round hit his
armoured vehicle in central Bosnia shortly after another ceasefire came into
force throughout the republic, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Bosnian Croat leaders meanwhile said some 2,000 Croats had been killed in
recent fighting against Moslems in central Bosnia. Fighting was reported
yesterday even after the truce, brokered by the UN among the three warring
factions, went into effect at noon.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council voted last night to deploy
7,600 troops, backed by air power, to provide protection in six designated
'safe areas' in Bosnia, including the capital Sarajevo.
The council also authorised the deployment of 300 Americans to Macedonia to
help prevent fighting in nearby Bosnia from spreading.
The vote on both deployments was 15-0.
EC foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Bosnia tomorrow, the
eve of the EC summit in Copenhagen.
The talks were called after Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said he needed new
guidelines after the collapse of the Vance-Owen peace plan.

FT  19 JUN 93 / China agrees HK harbour project

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects for a Sino-British agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's
multi-billion dollar airport project brightened yesterday when China gave
its approval for the construction of the western harbour crossing - one of
the HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.96bn) project's nine core elements.
British negotiators came away from the talks cautiously optimistic about a
solution to larger issues. Mr Anthony Galsworthy, leader of the UK team,
said after the meeting: 'We made real progress this morning.'
UK officials later said that for the first time in a year of talks Chinese
negotiators had got down to detailed discussions about financing.
'We wanted a response from them to our financial proposals and we got one,'
said one member of the British team. Both sides are keeping tightlipped
about the Hong Kong government's latest proposal for financing the airport
authority - which will manage the Chek Lap Kok airport - and a connecting
railway which will be built and run by the mass transit railway corporation.
The talks are being conducted by the airport committee of the Sino-British
joint liaison group. The committee has agreed to meet again by the end of
this month, but British officials do not expect all issues to be settled by
then.
However, they took heart at Beijing's decision to approve the western
harbour crossing, the franchise for which had been provisionally awarded to
a consortium including Wharf, an existing tunnel operator in Hong Kong, and
Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed investment arm in Hong Kong.
China had been informed that the Hong Kong government would be unable to
meet its June 1997 deadline for the completion of the airport and related
projects unless the companies awarded the franchise won approval to proceed
with the HKDollars 7bn project.
The government has also informed the Chinese of another pressing deadline
associated with the central and Wanchai land reclamation. Only part of this
is for the airport railway.
British officials hope that at the next meeting of the airport committee the
Chinese will allow this project to proceed.
The finance committee of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, the colony's law
making body, yesterday approved interim funding of HKDollars 562m for the
provisional airport authority.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Airlines face 747 safety costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S cash-strapped airlines face paying for much of the cost of
rebuilding engine mountings on almost 1,000 Boeing 747s following Boeing's
decision to strengthen and add several components, writes Daniel Green.
The design changes follow Boeing's inspections of the 747 fleet after
accidents involving the aircraft. Last October, a 747 cargo aircraft crashed
into an Amsterdam apartment block, killing about 50 people. A similar
aircraft crashed off Taiwan in December 1991.
Boeing said yesterday it would supply the new parts free, but it was likely
the airlines would pay the labour costs of fitting them. 'It is expected
that each airplane will take two or three weeks to modify,' it said. It
would take 4-5 years for all 948 747s in service to be altered.
Northwest, a US carrier, said it was working on the assumption it would pay
the labour costs, although British Airways and the UK's Virgin Atlantic said
they hoped Boeing would split this cost, too.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Nigeria's thwarted poll victor sees danger of turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIAN presidential candidate Moshood Abiola and his party warned
yesterday that peace and stability would be at risk unless the military
government announced the result of last Saturday's election.
They asserted that Mr Abiola had clearly won the election. Their plea for an
official result to be announced came amid rising tension, but they called on
Nigerians to remain calm.
The authorities suspended announcement of the poll result pending a court
ruling on a lawsuit brought by a group supporting the military ruler, Gen
Ibrahim Babangida.
A human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy, yesterday defied the ban,
declaring that the final tally showed Mr Abiola had won 19 of Nigeria's 30
states to 11 for his rival, Mr Bashir Othman Tofa.
Soldiers and riot police have been posted to some of the more volatile parts
of the country. There has been stunned disbelief since the National
Electoral Commission announced on Wednesday it had been restrained from
publishing the election results by a court ruling.
Three times since 1991 President Babangida has delayed the transition to
democracy, now scheduled for August 27 - the eighth anniversary of his
seizure of power.
'Two years ago I would not have believed this possible in Nigeria, it was
something that happened in other African states, but we've had so many
changes that Nigerians have become docile,' said one businessman in Lagos,
the commercial capital.
The mood of the Yoruba, who dominate the Social Democratic Party's
stronghold in the south-west, turned from celebration of the expected
success of Mr Abiola to outrage at the legal sophistry that may deny him
victory.
'Babangida took power by force, playing martial music and telling Nigerians
to stay calm,' said a young trader from Edo state in the mid-west. 'He
didn't worry about law courts and judges in those days. I just don't think
he wants to go.'
Although victory for Mr Abiola could mean a shift of power to the south,
northern Nigerians also regard the belated vote-rigging allegations by the
rival National Republican Convention (NRC) with contempt.
The indignation cuts across party lines: 'The SDP is not my party, but
Abiola won it fairly and he should get his chance,' said one NRC supporter
from Delta state. 'A lot of people don't care if it's Abiola or Tofa. They
just want a change.'
Nigeria is run down. Strikes have hit schools and hospitals, rubbish piles
up in the streets of the Lagos business district, power cuts and water
shortages are common, drains and roads are collapsing, and armed robbery is
unchecked by an incompetent and demoralised police force.
During recent fuel shortages, the prices of basic goods in the market and
public transport in Lagos rose by up to 200 per cent and have yet to come
down.
Outside the Central Bank of Nigeria, which has halved the value of the naira
in the past year, black market traders sell the currency for 60 per cent
less. If uncertainty over the election continues, they will mark the naira
down further.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Azerbaijan president fleesas rebels close on capital

<TEXT>
FORMER communist leader Mr Heydar Aliyev yesterday took over as Azerbaijan's
leader after the president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled the capital of Baku.
Mr Elchibey did not officially resign, but said he was leaving to avoid
bloodshed as armed rebels demanding his resignation closed in on the city.
The rebels, led by charismatic former businessman Mr Surat Husseynov, were
reported to be within a few miles of Baku yesterday evening. However, the
Turkish ambassador to Azerbaijan told a Turkish news agency that Mr Aliyev
had managed to persuade Mr Husseynov not to enter the city in view of the
president's departure.
At the same time, ethnic Armenians in the western region of Nagorno-Karabakh
were advancing against Azerbaijani troops on two fronts, near the towns of
Agdam and Martakert. The civil war has been the central issue in two-years
of political upheaval in Azerbaijan.
At the head of his 3,000-strong army, Mr Husseynov may demand a high
political price for halting his rebellion. Mr Husseynov's revolt on June 4
against Mr Elchibey, in which he seized Azerbaijan's second largest city,
Gyanja, triggered the political crisis in which five senior government
ministers have resigned and Mr Aliyev has returned to power as parliamentary
speaker after six years of political oblivion.
At 2am yesterday, Mr Elchibey was said to have ordered a government aircraft
to his home village of Kelaki in the region of Nakhichevan.
Government officials said the president left the capital without warning,
and left no instructions to his subordinates. Mr Aliyev said he also was not
alerted.
In parliament, Mr Aliyev said Mr Elchibey told him in a telephone
conversation late yesterday afternoon that he left to avoid bloodshed in the
capital. Mr Aliyev quoted the president as saying, 'whenever you want I can
come back. The decision rests with you'.
Mr Aliyev said the president had left him in charge until he returned to
Baku.
'The main thing right now is not to decide who is head of government,' Mr
Aliyev told the parliamentary deputies. 'First, we must find the way out of
the tense situation in the country.'

FT  19 JUN 93 / UN forces hunt Somali warlord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UN forces in Somalia continued their search for General Mohammed Farah
Aideed yesterday in spite of President Bill Clinton's assertion on Thursday
night that the operation against his militia was 'over and a success.'
There was no confirmation in Washington of a report that Gen Aideed had
taken two American and 12 Moroccan peacekeepers hostage, but an Australian
army officer in the Somali capital dismissed it as 'totally false.'
At his press conference, Mr Clinton said the murder of 23 Pakistani
peacekeepers by Gen Aideed's militia two weeks ago 'could not go
unpunished.' He added that the purpose of the UN operation 'was to undermine
the capacity of Aideed to wreak military havoc in Mogadishu.'
UN forces hit Gen Aideed's compound with an air and ground assault on
Thursday. His militia fought back using women, children and hospital
patients as shields, the UN said.
One Pakistani and five Moroccan UN peacekeepers were killed and 43 were
wounded, UN spokesman Joe Sills said in New York. The number of Somali
casualties was unclear but could range into the hundreds, given the
firepower used in the UN assault.
In Nairobi Gen Aideed's Somali National Alliance said yesterday the UN
attack killed 'more than 120 people, mainly women and children'. The
alliance also claimed Gen Aideed's forces captured two American soldiers and
12 other UN peacekeepers.
Mr Clinton said he would leave to the UN any decision of what to do with the
warlord if he were captured. He denied any US vendetta against Gen Aideed.
'As long as he was willing to co-operate with the UN, he was able to live
and work in peace,' the president said.
Mr Robert Oakley, chief US diplomat in Somalia during the US intervention
begun last November, said in a television interview that while it was right
to seek to cripple Gen Aideed's militia it was equally critical for the UN
to restart the process of political reconciliation and 'nation-building' in
Somalia.
Without being specific, Mr Clinton also promised that US personnel would
play on-the-ground roles in helping to keep the peace and promote democracy
in conflicts such as in Somalia, Camobodia and Bosnia.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Clinton adviser's vintage week: David Gergen emerged
triumphant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF it has been a good week for President Bill Clinton it has been a vintage
one for David Gergen. The fingerprints of the new presidential adviser were
all over just about everything that came out of the White House this week.
Gergen rules, imparted by the old master, James Baker, during the
prehistoric Reagan ice age, have not yet been filmed by Steven Spielberg nor
issued in paperback. But they are known to include:
Keep it simple even when it is not: in his press conference on Thursday
night, Mr Clinton, who loves the complex, offered, for the first time, a new
straightforward formula to describe the hideously complicated and still
disputed budget legislation.
'For every Dollars 10 in deficit reduction, Dollars 5, half of it, comes in
spending cuts, Dollars 3.75 comes in tax increases on the highest income
Americans - the upper 6 per cent - and Dollars 1.25 comes in taxes from the
middle class.
Families with incomes below Dollars 30,000 are held harmless in this
programme.' This will become the new administration litany, unless Congress
radically changes the numbers.
Borrow good ideas regardless of the source: three economic charts, all in
living colour, formed the backdrop to the press conference and were
frequently used by the president. So what if Ross Perot has been employing
the same technique for a year - or that David Gergen went boating with him
in Bermuda three weeks ago?
Never go public unprepared: Mr Gergen, who knew only too well what Mr Reagan
might say if deprived of his coaching and his 3-by-5 inch cards, put Mr
Clinton, normally so self-confident in his mastery of material, through a
mock press conference in the White House theatre in the hour before he went
on live TV for the real thing.
Do not get mad at the press because it is a no-win proposition: Mr Clinton
did lose his temper on Monday, perhaps understandably, and he could have
gone further. The media is asking itself if it has not been too hard too
early and one poll this week found more than four in ten Americans believing
he had not been given a fair shake by the fourth estate.
But, over a span of 72 hours, he followed through with two formal press
conferences and another, with President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, which came to
resemble one. In all three he dripped charm, joking with the TV journalist
who had so offended him and on Thursday night swapping garish Mickey Mouse
ties with a print reporter.
'You have to do your job as you see it,' he said in the most conciliatory
tones to the massed media, 'and I'm going to do mine the best I can.' The
joint responsibility, he went on earnestly, was to create 'an atmosphere of
trust and respect' in which 'I am going to do my best to be honest with you
and you're going to be honest with me.'
Whether the president - or the media - believes it or not is secondary to
the fact that both, for the moment, are going to be on better behaviour and
terms.

two days of talks which ended yesterday in London, writes Alexander Nicoll.
Britain's offer is understood to be higher than the Pounds 5m it previously
offered, though still only a contribution to the costs of some Pounds 50m
which Australia was claiming.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S chemicals industry is heading for a serious crisis and the European
Commission should introduce emergency measures across the continent to
stimulate economic recovery, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the British
companies Imperial Chemical Industries and Zeneca, warned yesterday.
'Politically, economically and chemically, the industry's performance has
been depressingly poor,' Sir Denys admitted at yesterday's European Chemical
Industry Council (Cefic) annual general assembly in London.
His warning came as Cefic forecast zero GDP growth in Europe this year, a
2.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output, a 0.5 per cent fall in chemical
output, a 6 per cent fall in chemical industry investment, and a 3 per cent
fall in chemical industry employment.
Cefic said stocks were above normal and order books poor. Given weak demand
prospects and excess capacity, there would be continued pressure on margins.
Europe's chemical industry employs 2m people directly and generates sales of
Ecu300bn (Pounds 236bn) a year, equivalent to 3 per cent of western Europe's
GDP.
Sir Denys called for a speedy end to the Gatt negotiations on world trade
liberalisation.
He said no measures should be introduced by the EC Commission that weakened
Europe's competitive position. He singled out proposals for a carbon tax,
which he said would be particularly unhelpful. To a large extent,
self-inflicted and unnecessary pricing wounds had caused a collapse in
financial performance, he said.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Hungary in Dollars 800m Russian Mig deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HUNGARIAN government has announced it expects to sign a contract in the
next few days to acquire Dollars 800m (Pounds 528m) worth of Mig-29 fighter
aircraft, spare parts and ammunition from Russia in a swap against Russia's
trade debts.
The deal for the 28 modern Mig-29 interceptors, which was approved by the
Hungarian government this week, is part of the largest arms transaction in
eastern Europe since the fall of communism.
Budapest will offset the Dollars 800m against Russia's Dollars 1.7bn debt to
Hungary, which was the outstanding balance at the start of 1992, when the
two countries closed the books on their trade under the old Comecon system.
Military and political leaders said they would have preferred western
equipment to Russian. Preliminary talks were held with Saab, the Swedish
manufacturer, as well as with the US government for F-16s.
But officials claim a comparable purchase from the west would have cost up
to Dollars 1.5bn, or about two years' defence expenditure, and Hungary's
government finances are already overstretched.
Hungary believes its only hope of recovering Russian trade debts is to
accept repayment in kind. It is also anxious to strengthen its air defences.
Mr Pal Teleki has resigned as chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV
RT after revelations that he received a Dollars 130,000 a year salary top-up
from the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund, an institution set up by the US
government to promote private enterprise in Hungary.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Miners agree to pit closure 10 weeks after reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday signalled the beginning of the end for most of the 12
pits it reprieved just 10 weeks ago when it secured miners' approval to
close one and sought the closure of another two.
The moves drew a fierce rebuke from the Labour party but only muted
criticism from rebel Tory MPs who had forced the government into a
politically damaging retreat from its original plan to close 31 pits, after
public outrage at last October's announcement.
It is likely that the vote to close Rufford, in Nottinghamshire, will be the
first in a series of votes among the 12. Coal and electricity industry
executives believe few are likely to survive beyond a year because of an
even worse slump in the coal market than was predicted in March.
At Rufford, miners voted by a majority of 20 to carry on working until the
current face runs out of coal around the end of the year. This option
attracted 226 votes, according to British Coal. Another option rejecting the
claim that the pit has no future beyond next year won 206 votes.
British Coal wants to close Rufford by Christmas. At Markham, in Derbyshire,
members of the National Union of Mineworkers, the pit's majority union, meet
today to consider British Coal's closure proposal and colleagues in
Silverdale, Staffordshire, are likely to follow suit shortly.
Unlike officials of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, who recommended the
vote should take place at Rufford, NUM officials at Markham are advising
members not to hold a vote, and to resist attempts to close the pit.
In all three cases, British Coal has warned that geological problems are
threatening the pits' futures. If miners accept closure by Christmas, they
will be entitled to enhanced severance terms of up to Pounds 37,000 or a job
elsewhere.
Rufford, Markham and Silverdale were among 12 pits which the government said
it would subsidise in March after a backbench revolt over pit closures. The
subsidy depended on British Coal finding a market for their coal but the
corporation said yesterday that some of the 12 were still not competitive
enough.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry secretary, said he would demand an
explanation from the government on Monday as to why it had misled the
Commons by claiming it had saved the 12 pits. The reprieve followed a public
outcry over plans to close three-fifths of Britain's mines. With the market
for coal contracting, few are expected to have a long-term future.
Mr Cook said the energy market had been rigged against coal and urged Tory
MPs to resist the new closures. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said Labour wanted the government to destroy jobs in the rest of
industry 'to try to maintain jobs in the coal industry.'
Meanwhile, British Coal said it had received about 100 expressions of
interest in the first four of 20 pits it is offering to the private sector,
although not all applicants wanted to mine coal.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Dollar up sharply on D-Mark, yen and Pounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR moved sharply higher against the D-Mark, the yen and sterling
yesterday amid increasing concern over deteriorating economic conditions in
Germany and the political upheaval in Japan.
It soared to a 15-month high against the D-Mark, in spite of the
Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to cut interest rates. The dollar
closed in London nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.68, breaking through
the top of a trading range that had prevailed since March last year. It went
on to close at DM1.681 in New York.
There was also a dramatic reverse in the yen's sharp rise against the
dollar, which has dominated currency dealing in recent weeks. After the vote
of no confidence in Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government, the yen plunged to
Y109.30 against the dollar at the London close, and 109.75 in New York.
That left the Japanese currency some 2 1/2 per cent weaker than 24 hours
earlier.
Sterling also fell against the surging dollar, closing in London nearly 2
cents weaker against the US currency at Dollars 1.4960.
The D-Mark was increasingly beleaguered against other European currencies,
falling below FFr3.36 against the French franc for the first time in 13
months.
The recent fall in the D-Mark has left the Bundesbank in a dilemma. Members
of the German central bank's ruling council have talked of their concern
that the deterioration in the D-Mark's value may fuel inflation.
However, if the Bundesbank tries to preserve the value of the currency by
keeping short-term interest rates at high levels, it may aggravate the
German recession.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Cash settlement plan for BT share issue abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday abandoned a proposal which would have
made it easier to identify large sellers of BT shares in the days leading up
to the government's sale of its remaining 20 per cent stake in the company.
The exchange, however, did take the unprecedented step of requiring market
makers to tell it of any transaction of 100,000 shares or more, a move aimed
at uncovering efforts to drive down unfairly the price of BT shares.
This will go some way towards meeting the concerns of SG Warburg, the
merchant bank which is co-ordinating the BT sale, although the stock
exchange said it would not disclose the names of sellers.
Institutional investors had raised strenuous objections to the stock
exchange's original plan to encourage all pre-offer dealings in BT shares to
be settled in cash within 48 hours rather than over the normal two-week
settlement period.
Institutions said the proposal would have unfairly aided advisers to the
offer in their efforts to support the price of BT shares. 'The stock
exchange should be taking into account the interests of its users as well as
its members,' said Mr John Thompson, head of UK equities at Standard Life.
'Apparently the only reason they took account of users is because they were
publicly exposed. This is not the way for the stock exchange to behave.'
The National Association of Pension Funds, Britain's largest shareholder
group, said it would press the stock exchange to take greater account of
users' interests in making rules for the markets.
As well as large institutions, private investors considering applying for BT
shares would have benefited from the type of concerted selling the exchange
is seeking to uncover - because it would have depressed the price at which
the government's stake in BT is offered to the public.
The exchange did not explicitly say it was trying to uncover sellers who
depress share prices, only that it was interested in 'satisfying itself that
an orderly market is maintained at all times'.
However, an exchange spokeswoman said that, in a similarly structured
offering last summer of shares in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, advisers to
the deal complained that institutions had depressed the price by selling
through several brokers at one time.
It is typical for institutional shareholders to reduce their stakes in
companies which are about to offer additional shares for sale - a move which
usually leads to lower prices.
But Warburg had said it intended to reward those institutions who purchased
additional shares in the run-up to the BT offering by granting them higher
allocations. Those that sold would have lower allocations.
Warburg said: 'It is not right for us to comment either way on what the
stock exchange has done.'
However, one official at the bank expressed disappointment that the exchange
had failed to support its efforts to encourage cash settlement.

private investors?, Weekend, Page III

FT  19 JUN 93 / Miyazawa defeat throws Japan intopolitical turmoil: Snap
election is forced as rebel who toppled PM plans new party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN was plunged into political instability last night as the ruling
Liberal Democratic party was forced to call a snap election after the
humiliation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in a no-confidence
vote.
The LDP, which has ruled the country since 1955, was in chaos as members of
the 35-strong faction led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance and
agriculture minister, voted against the party in favour of the no-confidence
motion. The Hata faction is expected to form its own political party
shortly. A further 10 members from a separate LDP faction announced the
formation of a political group. More defections are expected today.
The no-confidence vote, proposed by three opposition parties, was prompted
by an inconclusive debate over the reform of the scandal-prone political
system. The government's failure to tackle the issue enraged members of Mr
Hata's pro-reform faction, and the no-confidence motion was carried by 35
votes.
After his defeat, a distressed Mr Miyazawa was compelled to dissolve the
lower house, the more powerful of the two Japanese houses, and call an
election. He claimed to have supported political reform, specifically an
overhaul of the electoral system, but that 'change was very difficult to
bring about'.
'What happened was very unfortunate,' a dejected-looking Mr Miyazawa said.
'I was called a liar but that's not true . . . I really thought I would be
able to achieve political reform.'
Under Japan's constitution, the election must be held within 40 days,
meaning that the campaign period will include the Group of Seven summit, due
to begin in Tokyo on July 7, at which Mr Miyazawa had hoped to impress as an
international statesman.
Business leaders expressed fears last night that the country faced an
extended period of political turmoil, which will limit the government's
ability to cope with an economic downturn and to deal with the increased
pressure from the country's trading partners, particularly the US.
Television opinion polls put the prime minister's popularity at a mere 10
per cent last night, suggesting that the LDP was unlikely to win a
parliamentary majority in the forthcoming poll and raising doubts about the
relationship between the party and the bureaucracy that has guided post-war
Japan.
Senior LDP officials demanded that the defectors be expelled from the party.
Mr Hata said he did not want to vote against his party, but had 'no choice'
but to bring down the government.
'We have entered a new era in Japanese politics. I am sure we will see a
realignment of the political system,' Mr Hata said. He is hoping events will
encourage more LDP members to join him in a new party and that he will able
to lure representatives from opposition parties.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, expressed
widespread concern that economic policy-making will stall when the economy
appears to have touched bottom. Business leaders wanted the government to
introduce another stimulatory package in August, but the election and the
prospect of continuing chaos in the LDP have left the package in doubt.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (15): 'We've nothing
to hide' - Profile, Dow Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A crisp April morning, under a clear blue sky, Midland Michigan seems
like the most pristine place on earth. Walking past the daffodils and
crocuses in Dow Gardens, just down the road from the Dow-funded arts centre,
it is hard to believe that one of the world's biggest chemical plants is
just a mile away.
Spring is a good time to visit Midland. In the summer, when the central
valley location causes an inversion of the humid air, Dow's presence in
Midland can seem less benign. 'I was born in Midland but I moved away a few
years ago because of the smell,' says a 36-year-old gas station attendant in
a nearby town. 'In the summer, we kept the doors and windows shut all the
time.'
But it was not just the smell of Midland that convinced Dow it had to do
something about the environment. 'In the mid-1980s, we were asked to look at
public perception of the chemical industry,' says Mr Ron Pingel, Dow's
director of environmental affairs and responsible care. 'After polling the
public, chemical company employees and Dow employees, we found a huge gap
between how the industry perceived itself and how the public perceived the
industry. We realised we had to do something.'
That something included improving its notoriously combative relationship
with the Environmental Protection Agency, which had reached a nadir in 1985
when Dow went to the Supreme Court, charging the agency with violating its
privacy after the EPA took aerial photographs of the Midland plant during an
air pollution investigation.
The company's public relations problem was made doubly difficult by its
reputation from the 1960s, when Dow was the maker of napalm and Agent Orange
used in Vietnam.
Dow's efforts to embrace its former adversaries extend beyond co-operating
with the EPA and meeting the guidelines of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association's responsible care programme. Dow established a board of outside
specialists in 1991 to guide its environmental policy, giving it access to
confidential documents and information. Dow has also initiated a number of
internal programmes to convince itself, and the public, that Dow is serious
about the environment.
Like other big chemical companies, Dow has cut its toxic emissions
substantially in recent years. The company says the greatest decline was in
the 1970s, before the figures were made public. In the US, the company says
its air emissions, as required by the Toxic Relief Inventory, have dropped
from 10,893 tonnes in 1989 to 8,212 tonnes in 1991. By 1995, Dow expects its
emissions to be closer to 5,000 tonnes.
Signs of Dow's greener face are scattered throughout corporate headquarters,
from the recycling bins in the dining room and offices to the memo pads
embossed with the Responsible Care logo.
When the CMA introduced Responsible Care in 1988, it was quickly endorsed by
Dow's senior management who realised the company needed to improve its
image. At the operating level Responsible Care met with less enthusiasm.
'When it was first mentioned to local plant managers, fear was in their
eyes,' says Mr Dave Buzzelli, Dow's vice president for environment, health
and safety.
Dow's waste reduction efforts centre on its WRAP (Waste Reduction Always
Pays) programme. The WRAP goals include reducing waste to the environment,
recognising employee efforts to cut waste, encouraging employees to think
about reducing waste at its source and measuring and tracking progress. The
company says many WRAP projects help save fuel, raw materials and
environmental costs.
'Instead of asking a group of environmental experts, we ask the business
teams to come up with ideas,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'For most business people in
the US, the environment has always been seen as a peripheral. We're trying
to change that so our business managers make decisions about products.'
Nevertheless, the overall cost component of Responsible Care is significant.
Dow's environmental, health and safety operating expenses were Dollars 600m
in 1992, including Dollars 200m for environmental capital investments. It
hopes the investment will pay off in the long run by reducing environmental
clean-up costs.
Perhaps the biggest change at Dow has been its efforts to open its
facilities to local communities. 'We're opening the gates to the public
because what you can't see, you imagine and what you imagine, you often
fear,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'We're showing that the company has nothing to
hide.'
The company has set up local community advisory panels to encourage dialogue
with its neighbours. 'Dow has been more than willing to discuss our
concerns, whether they are business concerns or environmental,' says Mr
Shirley Clowers, president of Midland's Chamber of Commerce and a local
panel member.
Others on the panel are more sceptical. Ms Mary Sinclair, a Midland
environmentalist and long a critic of Dow, says: 'Mostly, people tend to
just sit back and let Dow tell them what it wants to tell them. Dow did a
very good job of getting a cross-section of people for the panel, but it's a
company town.'
Ms Sinclair is frustrated by Dow's decision to burn dioxins in Midland in
spite of the concentrations of the highly toxic chemical in the region's
soil and recent findings by the EPA that dioxin may be more dangerous than
previously thought.
'I'm able to get information out to the community through the panel. When we
discussed siting an incinerator in the community, Dow didn't want to do any
explaining of the environmental issues. I was the one who had to bring up
the issues.'
Ms Sinclair is also worried about Dow's refusal to endorse an air quality
report by the International Joint Commission, a US and Canadian group which
advises governments of both countries. The latest report recommends that
incineration facilities in the region be phased out or required to eliminate
the production and emission of dioxins and other toxins.
Dow has also been criticised by local environmental groups for fighting
Right-to-Know legislation. Ms Tracy Easthope of the Ann Arbor Ecology
Center's toxics reduction project says: 'Dow may be one of the more
progressive companies, and some of the quotes from the chief executive and
Dow officials are impressive. But they need to act on their words.'
Other environmentalists have criticised Dow's methods of measuring waste
reduction, noting that incinerated material is not part of the toxics
release inventory which Dow uses to make claims of reduced waste. 'What Dow
has done is essentially to transfer where the waste goes, so that it has
reduced the amount of dioxin in the water through filtration but the sludges
from filtration either end up in a landfill or get incinerated. It goes
somewhere,' says one critic.
Dow's executives are not oblivious to these issues. 'Chemicals by their
nature are reactive so they all have some degree of hazard,' says Mr Pingel.
'We live here too. We use these products. The debate is our debate. I
believe we can research, manufacture, develop and sell chemicals in ways
that don't expose people to undue risk.'

<TEXT>
PRISA, the Spanish media group that owns the El Pais newspaper and SER, the
leading domestic commercial radio station, confirmed that plans to lift its
18.3 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, the UK group which controls The
Independent and The Independent on Sunday newspapers.
The Spanish group reported consolidated profits last year of Pta5.1bn
(Dollars 413m), 28.4 per cent up on 1991. Canal Plus, a pay television
channel launched in 1990 that is 25 per cent Prisa owned, came close to
breaking even last year and is forecast to add some Pta2bn to Prisa's
consolidated balance sheet.
Mr Juan Luis Cebrian, Prisa's chief executive, told shareholders he believed
it was 'necessary to strengthen' the group's position in the British
newspaper publishing company at a time when the UK appeared to be emerging
from recession.
Prisa, together with La Repubblica, the daily owned by Italy's L'Espresso
group which also owns an 18.3 per cent stake in the UK publishing company,
are jointly examining the possibility of raising their respective stakes in
The Independent to just under 25 per cent. This would effectively give them
a controlling say in the British newspaper.
The two continental Europe groups entered Newspaper Publishing's equity in
1991 and their final decision on whether to press for an increased
shareholding is expected shortly. Prisa and L'Espresso are also studying the
creation of a French morning newspaper together with The Independent and Le
Monde.

<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Cement Companies, India's largest cement group, reported a sharp
fall in profits last year as demand for cement slowed, writes RC Murthy in
Bombay.
ACC failed to recover fully from cost increases fuelled by double-digit
inflation.
Sales rose by 7 per cent to Rs15.62bn (Dollars 502.2m) in the year ended
March 1993, but gross profits fell by 38 per cent to Rs1.8bn. After
provisions, net profit was Rs695m, down from Rs1.1bn the previous year.
ACC is the third large company within India's Tata group to report a fall in
profits in the year to March.
Dividends remained unchanged at Rs3 per share, but the payout of Rs235m was
higher than the Rs167.9m paid out in 1991-92 because of a rights issue.

SIEMENS NIXDORF, the German information technology group, and Fujitsu,
Japan's largest computer maker, are extending their co-operation in
mainframe computers to include next-generation machines.
Fujitsu will supply Siemens with high performance semiconductor
manufacturing technology to be used in Siemens's entry-level and mid-range
machines, while Siemens will provide Fujitsu with the central processing
unit technology for Fujitsu's entry-level range.
Siemens and Fujitsu will work together on operating systems software and on
components. The tie-up extends the relationship the two companies have had
in mainframes, in which Fujitsu has supplied Siemens with high-end mainframe
computers.
The extended relationship underlines both companies' belief that high costs
need to be reduced in view of the length of time it takes to develop
mainframe computers.
Fujitsu is one of the largest makers of mainframes in Japan, but this is a
shrinking business with users increasingly switching to equally powerful but
much cheaper workstations and PCs.
Applied Materials of the US, the world's largest maker of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, and Komatsu, the Japanese construction machinery
maker, are setting up a joint venture to develop, manufacture and market
equipment to make liquid crystal displays.
Applied Materials and Komatsu will each take a 50 per cent stake in the
joint venture, which will be established in Japan.
The new company will take over the business of Applied Displays Technology,
a subsidiary of Applied Materials established in Japan in 1991 to develop
equipment to manufacture LCD panels.
The market for LCD panels, which are used in laptop computers and compact
televisions, is expected to show strong growth.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Blue chip offers from Beijing: The first Chinese companies
to be partially sold in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's new capitalists are nearly ready to go to market. It has been a long
haul and there is more preparation to be done. But by the end of next month,
up to four out of nine Chinese state companies should be ready to be listed
on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The listing of the nine - among China's largest state-run companies - is a
milestone both for the Communist authorities in Beijing and for Hong Kong.
For China, it will give investment-hungry industries their first access to
foreign funds, while representing a victory for the country's economic
reformers, eager to show that Chinese companies can meet the demands of an
international market.
For Hong Kong, China's entry to the stock exchange adds substance to the
colony's claim that it is the place from which to invest in China. It will
also be a relief to those who feared Beijing might jeopardise Hong Kong's
economy because of the dispute with Britain over the conditions for handing
over sovereignty to China in 1997.
Under Hong Kong stock exchange requirements, China must put at least 25 per
cent of each company seeking a listing up for sale. It will do so by
floating 10 per cent for in each company on the Hong Kong exchange and 15
per cent on the Shanghai exchange. Control of the companies will remain with
the Chinese state.
If the flotations succeed, more will follow. The first four to be listed,
advisers say, will be Shanghai Petrochemical, one of China's largest
petrochemical manufacturers; Tsingtao Brewery, producer of one of China's
best known exports, Tsingtao beer; Beijing Renmin Machinery, a manufacturer
of offset printing equipment; and Guangzhou Shipyard, in southern China.
Each will have to meet international accounting standards, appoint two
independent directors to each of their boards and retain the services of a
foreign investment adviser for three years after being listed.
While the checklist should instil some common ground rules, they do not
guarantee good housekeeping. But China's Securities Regulatory Commission,
set up late last year, hopes the disciplines of western accounting methods
and the need to be responsive to outside shareholders will improve
efficiency and provide a model for other companies.
Investors have demonstrated a keen appetite for China-related new issues in
the past - earlier this year an initial public offering for a Hong Kong
company which holds mainland automotive assets was oversubscribed more than
600 times - and the expectation is that the nine will be no different.
Foreign investor interest is expected to be especially strong.
The reason is straightforward. The companies come to the market at a time of
enormous foreign interest in China prompted by Beijing's apparent commitment
to free market reforms, and by the economy's vigorous expansion: investors
hope China's high rates of economic growth will underpin strong corporate
earnings and dividends.
Says one US investment adviser: 'Investors want to diversify into emerging
markets especially in Asia, and China is seen as an hot area.' Yet it will
be hard for foreigners to know exactly what sort of company they are
investing in. The companies are unlike anything in which they might have
invested before and have no western equivalents. 'The task for the foreign
investor is to sift through a growing list of investment opportunities and
find the companies with management capable of making the change from the old
to the new business environment. That's not going to be easy; management in
many cases hasn't got the foggiest idea.'
A further aspect of the differences between Chinese and western operations
is the way they evaluate their corporations financially. In China, the
yardstick of financial success is output rather than profit. 'Chinese
companies suffer from the big is beautiful problem,' says Mr Meocre Li, a
partner with accountants Arthur Andersen, adviser to Tsingtao Brewery.
Attitudes differ too. One foreign adviser took a group of foreign investors
to see one the companies. The president outlined plans for a new plant. 'The
investors wanted to know what the break even was, what the new plant's
contribution to profits would be, and so on. The president dismissed their
questions with a wave of his hand, saying Li Peng, China's prime minister,
had personally authorised the investment so everything would be all right.'
Aside from the risks attached to investing in a different, and largely
unknown, environment, merchant bankers helping to bring the nine to market
express concern about their clients' attitudes towards raising foreign
equity.
'They view the flotation as providing them with a pot of money, and the
prospectus the price they have to pay to get it,' said one UK merchant
banker in Hong Kong working on a listing. 'If the man from the Pru turns up,
owning 5 per cent of the company, I'm not sure how they will deal with him.
The management of these companies just does not understand the long-term
consequences of raising foreign equity.'
In future, China's company managers will have to respond to the demands of
foreign shareholders, who may expect greater access to managers and to
information about how a company in which they have a stake is run.
Foreign shareholders and Chinese managers will have to adjust to each other
in what is likely to be a painful process. This was graphically demonstrated
last year when Shanghai Vacuum, a television manufacturer, became the first
mainland Chinese company to issues shares in Shanghai to foreigners. Instead
of focusing on television-making as it had promised minority investors, the
company used much of the foreign capital to speculate in property. When the
company tried to raise fresh capital through a rights issue, it flopped. The
foreign investors felt they had no guarantee about where their money would
go.
The regulatory standards in Hong Kong - including accounting standards,
rules on insider dealing and investor protection - might prevent cases where
foreign investors feel they have been abused. However, it is likely to be
some time before investment decisions by foreigners in China can be based on
much more than calculated guesswork.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Ford blames price variation on currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe said yesterday it was an 'almost impossible task' to
harmonise new car prices across the European Community 'in a market which,
itself, is neither stable nor harmonised'.
Currency fluctuations were frustrating attempts to bring prices more into
line across Europe.
It was 'not reasonable to expect manufacturers to make instant price
changes, possibly as great as 30 per cent, purely because of exchange rate
movements,' said the company.
Ford's outspoken criticism of the European Commission's move to create
greater 'price transparency' in the car market, came as Brussels prepared
for the first time to publish comparative pan-European car price lists.
Under the terms of an agreement made with the Commission last year carmakers
are due to publish price lists twice a year following fierce complaints in
particular from consumer organisations in Brussels and in the UK, which
insist that the persistent wide divergence in European car prices have
breached EC regulations.
Ford admitted yesterday that some of its prices for an identical model
varied by up to 30 per cent between markets, but it blamed the divergence on
the strength of the D-Mark and the weakness of the Italian lira. The price
differences for Ford models between most markets were within the 12 and 18
per cent EC guidelines, said the company, but the price of a Fiesta small
car, for example, was 30 per cent higher in Germany than in Italy (at May 1
exchange rates).
For all of its four main model ranges the highest prices were in Germany and
the lowest in Italy with UK prices in the middle of the range.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (14): Legacy of
Minamata - Responsible care in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE engagement of the Crown Prince to Ms Masako Owada was announced
earlier this year, most Japanese media coverage did not fail to mention Ms
Owada's family links to a historic pollution disaster in Japan.
Ms Owada's grandfather was once chairman of Chisso, a company which was
responsible for the death and physical disability of thousands of victims of
mercury poisoning in the late 1950s.
The references to Chisso are a reminder of the powerful impact that the
mercury poisoning disaster continues to have on the Japanese public
consciousness.
The mercury poisoning first surfaced in Minamata, a fishing village in
southern Japan. That and other serious pollution problems traced to
chemicals manufacturers in the ensuing years have left a deep-rooted
suspicion of the chemicals industry among the Japanese public.
But it has also meant that Japan's chemicals industry is obliged to comply
with stringent environmental regulations. 'In terms of dealing with
pollution, Japan is a developed nation,' asserts Mr Koichi Nishikawa,
managing director of technical matters at the Japan Chemical Industry
Association. 'We have the strictest regulations in the world on pollution
and very strict social monitoring.'
This confidence in the industry's handling of environmental issues, under
the guidance of government regulation, led Japan initially to question the
necessity of introducing Responsible Care.
At Japanese chemical factories, checks on safety measures are made by
regional authorities even in the middle of the night. Japan has also
developed some of the most sophisticated environment protection equipment
for desulphurisation and water purification.
The chemical industry has been educating its workers on environmental
protection for over 20 years, ever since the severe pollution problems of
the 1970s caused a public outcry and severely damaged the industry's image.
As a result of these measures, there are very few chemical accidents or
labour injuries among Japanese companies, Mr Nishikawa claims. The frequency
rate last year of lay-off injuries for over one year was on average 0.5 per
million working hours.
'This is a superb performance and indicates the high level of training among
Japanese plant managers,' Mr Nishikawa says.
The point is echoed by Mr Yoshita Sakami, general manager of the environment
and safety department at Sumitomo Chemical who says that 'Sumitomo has
emphasised co-existence and co-prosperity with society from the time of our
establishment so the concept of responsible care is nothing new to us.'
Nevertheless, the Responsible Care programme was launched by the association
with the participation of 168 companies and 49 industry associations. The
association felt that 'there was a need for continuous reform, for example,
where there are no government reforms yet,' Mr Nishikawa says.
The Responsible Care programme concentrates on areas where there are no
regulations, such as on making effective use of waste and waste
minimisation.
Another feature of Japan's programme is that it includes energy, which is
not included in the US or EC guidelines, Mr Nishikawa points out. 'In Japan,
energy is also an environmental issue.'
In addition to protecting the environment from chemical wastes and ensuring
safety measures are in place, 'we also have a responsibility to supply
products that take into consideration the environment, such as those that
can be recycled,' says Mr Sakami at Sumitomo Chemical.
The efforts that the industry has put into dealing with environmental issues
have helped to improve its image in recent years. The industry has suffered
from an image problem which began with the pollution of the 1960s and 1970s
and continued through the two oil shocks when the Japanese chemical industry
entered a structural recession.
There is some evidence that that image has changed for the better. A recent
survey for the JCIA found that respondents felt that of all the industries
listed the chemicals industry had made the most efforts to deal with
pollution.
That compares with a survey in 1978 when 66 per cent of respondents felt
that the chemicals industry was the biggest producer of pollution.
The industry has also launched a campaign to further public understanding of
the industry and its important role in society. It uses the catchphrase:
'Chemistry makes our dreams come true,' and is backed by the ministries of
education and of international trade and industry.
But the chemicals industry still has a long way to go to counter the
public's lingering suspicion of its commitment to environmental protection.
'There are many incidents that show chemicals companies are still breaking
the rules on pollution,' says the Consumers' Union of Japan.
It points to reports of dead fish surfacing in rivers and of pollution, for
which a chemicals company is usually found to be responsible.
Japanese chemical companies are widely suspected of polluting in countries
where environmental regulations are not as strict as in Japan, indicating
that the public still distrusts the chemicals companies' intentions.
Even Mr Nishikawa at the industry association admits that 'since Japan is a
country traditionally ruled by government regulation, there is a feeling
that what is not a regulation is not necessary.'
Japan's chemical industry still has a long way to go to overcome the legacy
of Minamata.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (13): Keeping ahead
of the game - Profile, Elf-Atochem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the estuary from Harfleur, where nearly 600 years ago Henry V landed
for his Agincourt campaign, dark smoke emerges from one of the stacks at
Elf-Atochem's petrochemicals plant at Gonfreville-l'Orcher.
Such pollution is an exception to the rule, insists Mr Andre Grosmaitre,
director of the site. The complex, consisting of a 470,000-tonne a year
ethylene cracker and capacity for manufacturing derivative plastics, has
received substantial investment in recent years to reduce and minimise
emissions.
'We've cut the site's annual emissions to the air from 25,500 tonnes a year
in 1977 to 7,848 tonnes last year. Meanwhile, hazardous waste production,
which increased from 4,480 tonnes in 1986 to 10,690 in 1990, has been cut
again to 4,550 tonnes. As for liquid emissions, they have been reduced by
more than two-thirds since 1981,' claims Mr Grosmaitre.
When the local authorities allowed production to increase by 30 per cent in
1990, they insisted emissions should not rise. In fact, they have actually
fallen, he points out
In spite of such achievements, the group's management has set what it
believes are ambitious targets to reduce emissions over the next five years.
During that time, it plans to reduce water emissions by 30 per cent, cut
production of 17 key wastes by 50 per cent and nitrogen oxide emissions by
25 per cent, and to increase the proportion of hazardous wastes treated
within the organisation from 90 to 95 per cent.
Such targets are voluntary, but in spite of the cost are highly necessary,
says Mr Francis Bazile, board director responsible for the environment. The
group worldwide spends about FFr2.4bn a year on the environment. At
Gonfreville alone, the company spends FFr20-30m a year on capital projects
for safety and the environment, as well as about FFr40m a year on
environmental operating expenses.
'If we want permission for a new unit, we have to be ahead of the game, so
we make sure we are below the levels insisted on by the local prefecture,'
says Mr Grosmaitre.
The investment and progress have been made, not directly because of
legislation, but rather to head off legislation, explains Mr Grosmaitre.
'We don't want the administration imposing something on us, because it would
be unlikely to be the best solution for the environment. We might have to
spend a lot of money that would have little impact on the environment,' he
says.
If the chemical industry is not seen to improve its performance, then there
is a danger that unnecessary legislation may be introduced. Recent EC
legislation controlling 132 micro-pollutants would make effluent purer than
drinking water, he claims.
Elf-Atochem's general philosophy is to reduce waste production at source
rather than deal with it at the end of the pipe,' says Mr Roger Papp,
director of safety and environment at the company.
Mr Bazile gives the example of the polystyrene plant at Carling in the
department of Moselle where the company introduced a new technology that
recycles the waste monomer, eliminating the need to produce aqueous wastes.
Much of the effort at Gonfreville has gone into waste minimisation. The
halving in the production of hazardous waste was achieved by recycling a
byproduct - aluminium chloride - rather than incinerating it, and then using
the chemical for cleaning water.
'Our internal surveys show the efforts we have made have paid off. People
are proud to be working for the company. They are conscious of the enormous
progress we have made,' says Mr Grosmaitre.
Externally, progress has also been made, he claims. This has been achieved
as much by the improving environmental performance of the complex as by a
programme to communicate that improve- ment to the local population.
The company campaigns on its own and through a body representing the
industrial zone behind Havre where the complex is sited.
Mr Grosmaitre explains: 'Three or four years ago we conducted a qualitative
opinion poll of attitudes to the industrial zone and the Harvraise
population. We found there was a gap in understanding. On the one hand,
there were expectations that the industrial zone would take up the slack
from the declining port-based industries. But at the same time, there was
suspicion about this apparently mysterious universe.'
The companies located in the industrial zone launched a newsletter in three
local newspapers, explaining what the factories did, and giving details
about safety issues. An additional booklet, put together by 26 companies,
provided information for youngsters wanting to find employment in the zone.
The companies also targeted the local school population. Mr Grosmaitre
explains that when you influence a child, you influence the whole family.
Visits include showing the site fire-engines putting out blazes and picnics
in countryside near the plant. Independently, teachers from all disciplines
were invited.
The safety of the industrial zone is also stressed. The last serious
incident was in 1940, when retreating French forces sabotaged the oil
refinery to stop it falling into Axis hands.
Mr Grosmaitre reckons a measure of the success of Elf-Atochem's efforts is
the lack of difficulties the company had in receiving permission for a
FFr2bn extension three years ago.
'We are never finished,' he admits. 'At the moment, the biggest concern in
Le Havre is the smell of sulphur from the industrial zone. That's a bigger
problem than unemployment, Aids or any other issue, and we will have to deal
with it.' The immediate target is to cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 50 per
cent within 10 years.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (11): Disclosure is
now a way of life - Attitudes to public information have changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chemical industry is at a crossroads in environmental reporting. After a
burst of enthusiasm comes the need for consolid- ation and improvement in
the quality and consistency of what it says.
Just a few years ago, the sector was as uncom- municative and inactive as
many other types of company. When it came to public information, there was
next to none. Now it stands ahead of most of the rest.
'It's hard to think of any major international chemical company that does
not provide some form of environmental information,' says Mr John Elkington,
head of Sustain- ability, an environmental consultancy based in London, and
joint author of a recent study of green reporting. 'The industry has been in
the lead in the whole area of disclosure.'
Suddenly, there is a separate sub-industry growing up around environmental
consulting, auditing and training. The Institute of Chemical Engineers, for
instance, recently felt the need to produce a training package on
environmental auditing.
Part of the change in attitude to public information reflects the existing
internal work being conducted by the industry. Effective management systems
have been introduced over a long period for economic reasons of waste
minimisation. Recycling has made sound business sense.
On toxic emissions and other pollutants, part of the change also reflects
the growing interest, regulatory requirements and public and peer pressure
for greater green disclosure.
But Mr Elkington highlights two key events which have brought about greater
disclosure in the industry within the last decade. The first was the leakage
of toxic gas from the Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal in India in
1984, which is estimated to have killed more than 3,800 people.
He says that left many companies feeling very exposed, and led to a wave of
environmental audits of their operations. Monsanto even issued what it
called the 'Monsanto pledge' on the control of emissions. Other companies
followed this lead.
Bhopal particularly affected US-based chemical groups. Norsk Hydro is feted
for its environmental reporting, but Mr Elkington points to another
embarrassing incident in the past which helped spark this approach: a
break-in at one of the company's sites by a Norwegian green pressure group
called Bellona, which publicised high levels of soil contamination.
While the incidents sparking greater disclosure have been so negative, they
have at least brought about considerable positive change through increased
disclosure. Several recent surveys suggest that chemicals now provide more
environmental information than most other sectors.
'Over the last few years the chemical industry has certainly realised that
its bottom line is affected by its public reputation, and has paid a lot
more attention to communicating with its audience,' says Mr Guy Liardet of
the Chemical Industries Association.
Mr Elkington says: 'I think there has been a very significant shift in
thinking about disclosure since 1989. Before then, most companies felt it
would be undesirable. Now we have gone beyond the watershed.'
Initial fears that reporting, fuelled by the consumer pressures of the late
1980s, would die away in the harsher economic conditions of the 1990s seem
to be unfounded, he adds. 'But environmentalism hit its high water mark in
1990,' he warns.
That does not mean the results of greater reporting have been uniform. The
first environmental document produced by ICI, for instance, was criticised
for highlighting the good news and neglecting to mention more critical
information such as fines and court hearings against it.
Mr Elkington points to Dow Europe as the model for better reporting,
primarily for two reasons: the publication of environmental data
site-by-site rather than lumped together; and for providing comparative
figures on previous performance and projected targets for the future.
He says there are two principal issues after the floodgates on disclosure
among chemical companies: first, that it is confined to that sector with
relatively little from other sectors; and second, that there is a lack of
standardisation which makes comparisons fraught even between those which do
produce public reports.
He would like to see regulations and legislation to bring about greater
consistency in reporting. But others are less sure. Mr Liardet, of the
Chemical Industries Association, argues that would be too complex to
introduce, difficult to police, and would reduce the flexibility in
reporting the most relevant information on the enormous range of chemical
products and byproducts generated.
Instead, he cites voluntary guidelines to be launched at the end of June by
Cefic, the European chemical industry council of which the CIA is a member.
These are likely to include information on accidents, complaints, energy
consumed, and details of particularly hazardous types of waste.
That reflects the general tenor in Europe of voluntary guidelines in
contrast to the regulation-driven system in the US. Attempts to emulate such
a system on the eastern side of the Atlantic have foundered, with few
exceptions.
Emas, the European Commission's guidelines on ecological management and
audit scheme, released in final version this spring, is a case in point. It
began as a mandatory scheme across all of a company's operations. It ended
up being voluntary and site-by-site. Regulation gave way to the argument
that competitive pressure alone would bring about compliance.
Mr Elkington highlights another big problem over environmental reporting in
Europe. In spite of the pressure in the past for greater information, there
has been little attempt to react to the published numbers by users of this
information.
In the US and Canada organisations have been active in building up databases
to make comparisons between different companies. In Europe, that is far less
the case.
'So far the response from non-governmental organisations has been relatively
disappointing,' he says. 'They called for data for many years. But their
reaction has been fairly mute.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (12): The grub
without the grubs - Profile, Ciba Pigments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE or four times a year, groups of local women visit the Ciba Pigments
plant at Paisley, near Glasgow. They are not concerned with the automated
processes which produce yellow and blue pigments: their destination is the
canteen.
Its chefs give cooking demonstrations and the women try out the recipes on
the spot, eating what they have cooked. It has nothing to do with chemicals
but, says Mr Ian Shankland, safety and environmental protection manager, 'it
makes visitors familiar with the plant and gets them to know the kind of
people we are.'
Ciba-Geigy has been in Paisley since the 1940s, developing, making and
marketing pigments for use in printing inks, paints and plastics. About 70
per cent of the plant's turnover - Pounds 116m in 1992 - is exported, much
of it to Germany.
Up to a decade ago the plant had little contact with the people of Paisley,
except as being a major employer (it currently employs 800 people and is the
town's biggest private sector employer). The change came as the public
became increasingly conscious of environmental issues, and the Swiss company
realised that to be environmentally sound was not just in the public
interest but was also in its own interests.
'There were financial people such as investors who thought Ciba-Geigy was
spending too much on environmental protection,' says Mr Shankland. 'But we
told them it was a positive investment for the future. At worst, we could go
out of business if we didn't do it. The company aims to be operating well
into the next century.'
Mr Shankland says that the Paisley pigments plant is a low hazard site with
a good environmental record, though he acknowledges that it is large and is
close to residential areas. The drive to improve its environmental standing
began around 1987 when Ciba-Geigy's headquarters in Basle decided to carry
out audits of all its sites and asked plants to highlight future problems.
At the same time, new EC legislation was coming into force.
The company decided that, in addition to complying with national
environmental standards, it would implement in all its worldwide plants the
stiffest standard being applied anywhere - which generally meant the German
standard.
Mr Shankland points out that although the Paisley plant is beside the River
Cart it draws no water from the river, being supplied by the local authority
water service. All its effluent goes through its own treatment plant before
passing to the municipal treatment plant, before being released in the River
Clyde.
He points to two sets of measures Ciba has taken to improve its
environmental performance. First, recognising in 1990 that increased
production of blue pigment with the phthalocyanine process would add to the
copper effluent from the plant, it cut the amount of copper used to make the
pigment. It chose this solution rather than devote its efforts to cleaning
up the effluent, which would have been what he calls 'an end-of-pipe
solution'.
The project did not involve capital expenditure, but rather the time and the
work of the chemists involved. It was successful in reducing copper levels
to half of what they had been and the new process turned out to be cheaper.
There was a risk that by changing the process Ciba would have altered the
product, making it unacceptable to the customer, but this did not happen.
Secondly, Ciba Pigments had to deal with the production of additional
ammonia from the increased output at the blue plant. The increase would have
breached Clyde River Purification Board limits. The solution was to build a
plant to oxidise the ammonia into nitrogen and water vapour by burning it
with natural gas.
The tall, thin blue chimney of the thermal oxidiser has become part of the
complex's skyline. The project cost between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds
300,000.
Both these measures were required to meet the legal limits, though Ciba
claims it exceeded them. However, other measures it has taken were not
required by outside regulation but rather to improve the environmental
performance and also the efficiency of the plant.
A major part of this is waste minimisation. As part of this, the company has
installed tanks to collect and recycle the sulphuric acid which it uses.
This has cut consumption of sulphuric acid by 30 per cent.
Ciba Pigments now delivers its pigment granules in portable hoppers which
the consuming company returns to Paisley after use. This eliminates the
waste of disposable containers or packaging.
The biggest capital expenditure has been to upgrade the Paisley complex's
sprinkler system and build an eight-inch-high wall around the entire
complex. These measures, costing Pounds 600,000, were taken after a bad fire
at the Sandoz plant in Basle in 1986 led to water from the fire brigades'
hoses carrying polluting chemicals into the Rhine.
Mr Shankland says that if such a thing had happened at Paisley the chemicals
would not have killed fish but they would have made 'a hell of a mess'.
A good part of the company's efforts over the past few years has aimed to
ensure that local people see Ciba Pigments as a good neighbour. Local
councillors and MPs visit the plant, and visitors' groups are encouraged.
'Most fear is based on ignorance,' Mr Shankland says, 'and most of what
people see coming out of the chimneys is water vapour. When they ask
questions we tell them the truth and they go away with any fears they might
have had dissolved.'
The company says its staff are its best ambassadors in spreading the word
about the plant. 'They want to be able to answer the questions people put to
them and so we hold monthly meetings to bring them up to date on what's
going on,' says Mr Shankland.
There is evidence that the image of the plant has improved in recent years.
'Ciba has good relations with people in Paisley,' says a local reporter. But
he recalls an occasion about two years ago when red dust leaked into the air
and landed on people's roofs and gardens.
Mr Shankland says: 'That was a one-off. A dust filter burst because it
malfunctioned. We've put in new equipment since then.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (10): The bedroom
move that says it all - ICI's community relations strategy seems to be
paying off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Why should one of the world's biggest chemical companies, manufacturing in
40 countries and selling 15,000 products, consider it has scored a success
when an elderly couple writes to it to say they had temporarily moved from
the front to the back bedroom of their Redcar semi?
For ICI on Teesside, this letter was a sign that the effort it has put into
its community relations strategy, bedrock of what it terms its moral licence
to operate, is paying off.
As Teesside's dominant employer, ICI has had enormous direct and indirect
influence on the surrounding population for much of this century. At its
early 1960s peak it employed more than 30,000.
But, by its own admission, its drop in employee numbers during the 1970s and
1980s to 10,000 on Teesside today (including Zeneca businesses), and its
historical reticence about explaining its operations to the public, combined
with growing environmental demands from surrounding communities to create
problems.
These came to a head in 1990 when people living around the Wilton site, on
the south bank of the Tees, became angry at flaring from OIefins 6, the
Wilton ethylene cracker.
A joint BP-ICI venture operated by ICI, the cracker is the second largest in
the world. Built in 1979 at a cost of more than Pounds 200m, its capacity
almost doubled in the 1980s and flaring, the noisy process in which excess
hydrocarbons are burned off during shotdown, increased.
Problems following the 1990 shutdown caused more flaring, further annoying
local people already unhappy at the Enron project, a plan to build the
world's largest gas fired power station at Wilton.
ICI realised it had to act to restore its own standing among local people.
Since then, under the banner of its community affairs group, it has become
much more pro-active and espoused a policy of dialogue with the community.
Methods of contact range from liaison plans and a promotional ICI community
bus to a free community safety calendar, offering emergency advice to people
within one mile of ICI sites and an exhaustive programme of educational
links.
Before the cracker under- went its shutdown - every third year - this
spring, ICI's community affairs group launched a 220,000 leaflet information
campaign; the result was zero complaints, and positive feedback, including
the letter from the elderly Redcar couple, who moved bedrooms because of the
flaring.
Chemical industry critics may point out there is more than a little
corporate self-interest in this - after all, the purpose and aim of ICI's
Teesside community action team, established in 1991, are 'to re-develop
employee morale/esteem/community spirit' and 'to protect and develop licence
to operate'. But Mr Peter Dunlop, a retired engineer who chairs the
Grangetown liaison panel, is in no doubt there has been a genuine change of
heart within ICI - perhaps more than the company would like to admit.
'In the past they weren't just complacent, they were off- hand,' he claims.
'Complaints from the community would go to ICI and just be ignored.'
Now, he says, the regular liaison panel meetings receive full details of ICI
emissions, and ICI experts attend when requested.
Significantly, ICI is now seen locally as an example for other local
companies. Mr Dunlop is heartened that British Steel is for the first time
sending a representative to this month's liaison panel meeting.
Mr David Walsh, chairman of Cleveland county council's economic development
committee, praises ICI for publicly identifying its emissions and reduction
targets. 'It's become a better neighbour,' he says. 'I'm encouraged that one
company is prepared to be very open. It's an example which ought to be
followed by other companies on Teesside.'
Mr Dunlop has never heard of the Responsible Care scheme; he believes ICI's
move to a more open approach was heavily influenced by the example set by
the American-owned Enron Corporation. He points out that Enron paid for the
Pounds 350,000 Grangetown neighbourhood centre in which the liaison panel
now holds its regular meetings.
The creation of liaison panels like Grangetown's are important in fulfilling
one of the aims of Responsible Care - demonstrating that performance
improvements are taking place.
Mr John Galbraith, ICI's Teesside operations safety manager, who is involved
in Responsible Care's north-east cell, says there has been a big change in
internal attitudes too in recent years in ICI.
'Ten years ago the feeling could have been there that management put safety
in place and the guys did as they were told. It's the involvement of
everyone which is the main shift.'
Giving priority to health, safety and environment issues means showing
management's commitment to these issues, says Mr Galbraith. 'Management
can't be seen to be complacent,' he says.
A cornerstone of the week is the Friday morning meeting between Mr Sandy
Anderson, ICI Teesside operations general manager, and production managers
to review the week's operations; the gist of discussions is passed back
through a communications cascade system.
ICI points out that despite sustained criticism from environmentalists,
notably Greenpeace, its emissions to the environment have been cut by 75 per
cent in the past 20 years.
It admits Teesside's industrial heritage, in which it has played a key role,
seriously polluted the Tees. After decades as a 'dead' river, salmon are
only now starting to return.
But ICI is keen to gain credit for the efforts it has made to reduce
emissions; between 1988 and 1992 alone it spent Pounds 100m on environmental
improvements. In the next few years it will spend tens of millions pounds
more.
The biggest investment is Pounds 66m on a newly opened sulphuric acid
recovery plant at Billingham, which has eliminated ICI's sea disposal of
acidic waste, significantly improving the Tees water quality.
The SAR plant is part of the Pounds 110m Monomer 8 project, ICI's biggest UK
investment for more than a decade. It is doubling its Teesside manufacturing
capacity of methyl-methacrylate to 200,000 tonnes annually and helping
establish ICI as the world's leading acrylics manufacturer. Significantly,
given the hold that jobs used to give ICI on the surrounding community, this
huge investment will permanently employ just 40 people.
The Monomer 8 project fits in with ICI's corporate strategy of concentrating
on businesses where it has global strength. But ICI faces more difficult
decisions about the cost effectiveness of environmental improvements to some
of its activities on Teesside, where several plants date from the 1960s.
While it expects to make a 64 per cent reduction in Teesside waste emissions
by 1996 - outstripping ICI's corporate 50 per cent target - the easy steps
have now been taken.
'We are getting to the point where it gets more and more difficult to make
improvements,' says Mr Tony Lewis, Teesside environmental services manager.
Compounding the problem, as ICI restructures it is under increasing
financial pressure to justify all its operations.
'We have to get value for money in terms of environmental improvements,'
says Mr Lewis. 'There may be occasions when businesses can't afford the
environmental improvements.'
He says it would be wrong to blame plant closures purely on the cost of
necessary environmental upgrading: it is one element in the equation, not
the total sum.
However, any factor which may reduce Teesside employment is of concern. But
it is striking how high up the general public's agenda - and the legislative
framework - environmental concerns have moved.
'Environmental improvement is not an option for us,' says Mr Lewis. 'I don't
think we have any choice.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (9): Unease and
jasmine in LA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Is the City of Angels going to hell?'
THE QUESTION was asked on the cover of Time magazine in April.
Los Angeles, more accustomed to throwing the spotlight on resident stars
than to airing its dirty linen in public, is still reeling from the year of
national scrutiny following the worst riots in recent American history.
Tensions have eased considerably in recent months, although many of the
underlying social problems remain.
Apart from a few burnt shells of buildings on the outskirts of Beverly
Hills, however, visitors to LA are unlikely to see the worst of the damage
which was largely confined to the city's poorer areas, such as South
Central.
It is easy to overlook the city's problems on a warm spring afternoon with a
hint of jasmine in the air, when the smog has been blown from the basin,
bringing the surrounding mountains into sharp relief. Los Angeles, at least
for most visitors, is awfully close to paradise.
In LA, however, paradise is only accessible by car. The city is building an
integrated rail system to relieve the appalling congestion on its streets,
but the system is still in its infancy.
All of the major rental agencies are represented at the airport and
throughout LA. Car rental rates are reasonable, and bargains are often
advertised in local papers.
If the thought of jumping straight into a freeway traffic jam after hours on
an international flight does not appeal, most hotels offer airport pick-up,
and there are also cabs and shuttle services. The Super Shuttle (tel 213
775-6600) is less expensive than a cab, and will drop you straight to the
door, but advance reservations are necessary. Visitors who plan to avoid car
rental should note that cabs cannot be hailed on the street.
LA is blessed with some of the most luxurious hotels in the country,
including the Hotel Bel-Air (213 472-1211) and the Four Seasons at Beverly
Hills (310 332-3442). The famous Beverly Hills Hotel, home of the more
famous Polo Lounge, is closed for renovation until 1994.
Downtown, the Biltmore (213 624-1011) is a glorious example of Spanish
architecture, LA-style. The hotel has been beautifully restored. Other
choices include the New Otani Hotel &amp; Garden (213 629-1200). For a taste of
Hollywood chic, try the Chateau Marmont (213 656-1010).
Restaurants abound in the shame, but it would be a crime to visit Los
Angeles without sampling its version of Mexican cuisine. Locals recommend
The Border Grill, Taxco, Casablanca and Casa Carnitas.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (13): Atlanta draws
relocators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATLANTA, THE American South's business capital, seems within reach of its
long-held goal: to become an international city. It is the site for the 1996
Olympic Games, and it hopes that the occasion will finally bring it world
attention and status.
The city is busy gearing up for the Games, which will bring thousands of
international visitors and have an overall economic impact of more than
Dollars 3.5bn.
Each year, 2 million foreign visitors already pass through Atlanta's
Hartsfield Airport, one of the world's largest and busiest. It is also a top
US convention city, hosting such major trade shows as 'The Super Show' for
sporting goods manufacturers, which drew 96,000 people last February.
A combination of gentle southern traditions and energetic 'Yankee' drive,
Atlanta seems in many ways the best of both worlds. Its metropolitan
population has swelled to 3m. Although the majority are not Atlanta natives,
many quickly acquire the contagious local southern drawl.
While other cities are still struggling to emerge from recession, Atlanta in
recent months has registered the strongest job growth in the US. With
relatively lower costs of business and living, it has recently drawn big
corporate relocations such as United Parcel Service and Holiday Inns, and
large non-profit organisation relocations such as the American Red Cross.
Atlanta, the cradle of the US civil rights movement, is also notable for its
harmonious racial relations. It was the home of Martin Luther King Jr; and
the Martin Luther King Center for the Study of Non-Violence, which houses an
important collection of his papers, is there. Mayor Maynard Jackson, who is
black, will not seek a fourth term this year, but is likely to be suceeded
by another black politician.
The city's amenities are also drawing cards. Nestled in rolling hills with
many trees, parks and gardens, Atlanta is a physically attractive place.
Although visitors can find traditional southern cooking, there is also
African, Vietnamese, Cuban, Indian and Italian fare, among others. Golf,
tennis and other recreational activities are easily accessible within the
city.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (10): Added value
in Toronto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UPSIDE of suffering an unexpectedly long and deep recession is that
Canada's biggest city now offers the business traveller far better value for
money than it did in the late 1980s.
Taxis are easier to find, and drivers will often negotiate fares for long
trips, such as to the airport. Queues for restaurant tables have noticeably
shortened. Prices for hotel rooms, meals and rental cars have barely moved
over the past two years.
Some foreign visitors will also find that their currency goes a lot further,
with the Canadian dollar now 12 per cent lower against the US dollar than it
was in 1991.
Toronto remains one of North America's more pleasant cities. The streets are
clean, and public transport efficient. Torontonians are not as friendly as
New Yorkers at their best, and they are invariably more polite than New
Yorkers at their worst.
The crime rate is low; women have little to fear on the streets, even after
sunset. Downtown hotels are within a short walk of Lake Ontario. Two, the
Westin Harbour Castle (tel 869-1600) and the Radisson Plaza (203-3333), are
on the waterfront.
Downtown Toronto has two new attractions for the visitor with a couple of
hours to spare. The refurbished Ontario Art Gallery, now one of the 10
biggest in North America, opened earlier this year to enthusiastic reviews.
For an insight into another side of Canadian culture, the ice hockey Hall of
Fame, located in a former Bank of Montreal building in the centre of the
financial district, is worth a visit.
The best hotel bargains are over weekends (which usually include Friday and
Sunday nights). A room at the King Edward Hotel, which is a member of the
Forte chain (tel 863-9700), is priced at CDollars 199 a night (CDollars 183
for corporate accounts). The rate drops to CDollars 150 on weekends.
The Camberley Court Hotel, located in one of the financial district's office
towers (tel 947-9025), charges CDollars 170 on weeknights, and CDollars 120
at weekends.
One of Toronto's joys is the plethora of ethnic restaurants. A popular,
moderately-priced Italian choice is Giovanna Trattoria (tel 538-2098, dinner
only). For Thai food in the downtown area, try Golden Thai (868-6668).
More elegant (and expensive) restaurants include Splendido (929-7788),
Scaramouche (961-8011), Prego della Piazza (920-9900) and Truffles at the
Four Seasons Hotel (964-0411).
Budget-conscious travellers would be well-advised not to eat breakfast in
the hotel. Muffin and bagel shops abound in the subterranean shopping malls
which criss-cross the financial district. A popular choice for a heartier
start to the day is Movenpick's self-service Marche (366-8986).
Travelling to and from Toronto is also more relaxing these days than it used
to be. The airport, whose spacious third terminal opened just as the
recession hit, is seldom crowded.
In their eagerness to please, Canada's two main airlines, Air Canada and
Canadian Airlines International, frequently upgrade economy passengers to
business class. Don't hesitate to ask.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (8): Faith renewed
in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY LINGERING notion that New York was mired in terminal recession, that it
was a city of past glories and tarnished elegance, vanished this month when
the Four Seasons chain opened its grandest creation, the Dollars 360m Four
Seasons Hotel, on Manhattan's upper east side.
The exterior of the limestone-clad IM Pei-designed tower captures the
flavour of the Chrysler Building, perhaps Manhattan's finest Art Deco
creation. But its interior is thoroughly modernist, with more limestone,
back-lit onyx and Dakota Jackson chairs. The Four Seasons, the most
expensive hotel ever built in Manhattan, already has achieved 'landmark'
status. One city magazine went so far as to call it a 'love song for New
York.'
Indeed, foreigners - the Four Seasons company is based in Toronto - and New
Yorkers alike seem to be renewing their faith in America's biggest
metropolis. Only a year or so ago, when recession still gripped New York,
the doomsayers predicted that the city would never recapture its 1980s'
wealth, verve and bustle. The wealth may be somewhat depleted, but New
York's confidence and energy are staging a credible come-back.
The Four Seasons isn't the only testament to city's rejuvenation after
several difficult years. Two hotels opened recently in Chinatown and others,
such as the Mercer in SoHo, are on the way.
Many business travellers, especially those with lavish expense accounts,
still prefer the carriage trade's old dowagers ' the Carlyle, the Pierre,
the Plaza and the Waldorf-Astoria. But all is not lost for budget-conscious
travellers. The Consumer Reports Travel Letter notes bargains and comfort
are not mutually exclusive. The Ameritania, the Ramada Hotel Pennsylvania
(rated a 'best buy') and the Helmsley Windsor offer conveniently located,
well-kept rooms for under Dollars 200 a night. Discounts often are
available.
Other aspects of New York life are also flourishing. Broadway has extended
its winning streak, which started with a record year in 1992 with hits such
as Guys and Dolls. This year, Kiss of the Spider Woman and Angels in America
have both won Tony Awards.
New York's once notorious nightclub scene has also come back from
near-death. Until last year, the Limelight was the city's only mega-club.
Owner Peter Gatien has since opened USA, a club housed in Broadway's Minsky
theatre with a raunchy Times Square theme, and has relaunched the old
Palladium. His rivals, the Ballinger brothers, recently opened Webster Hall,
a multi-level dance hall built in 1889 that was once Al Capone's hangout.
Those who prefer their amusement sweat-free can tour the Guggenheim Museum,
which has undergone a massive renovation that included the construction of a
new wing and a SoHo branch.
Die-hard shoppers will be pleased to find that Bloomingdale's, New York's
most famous department store, is thriving again after more than two years in
bankruptcy, and that Barneys, the elegant downtown fashion retailer, will
soon unveil an enormous outlet near Central Park.
There were moments during the recession when New York seemed destined to
become a 'third-rate Babylon', as the sage of Baltimore, HL Mencken, once
called it. New York may not be booming but its resilient spirit remains.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (12): Rain and work
in Vancouver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VANCOUVER is a city of water and mountains, where the breathtaking views on
a sunny day can steal a visitor's heart forever.
It could be for just that reason that it rains most days in the city.
Residents say the 'permagrey' weather allows them to get some work done in
this relentlessly beautiful outdoor metropolis.
Bring an umbrella, but expect more moderate temperatures than interior
regions at similar latitudes. Vancouver's coastal positioning makes it a
jumping-off point for ferries to the island cities of Victoria and Nanaimo,
a host of smaller ports, and Alaska.
Vancouver International Airport is located 8 miles south of the city, and is
served by most of the world's major airlines. The airport is small enough to
be navigated simply, with green-jacketed volunteers on hand to answer
travellers' inquiries. Car rentals are available, but if your business is
mostly downtown, consider leaving the car behind.
A cab ride downtown costs about Dollars 20, while a less-expensive
alternative is is the Airport Express bus. It runs regularly and serves the
major downtown hotels. (Buses from the airport will also whisk a visitor to
Whistler, about three hours north of the city on the aptly-named Sea-to-Sky
highway.
Whistler is a world-class mountain resort with conference facilities, a golf
course and skiing nearly year-round.)
Public transit is clean and efficient, offering choices of the automated
SkyTrain, the SeaBus, which ferries commuters to north and west sections of
the city, and land-bound but pleasant buses. Free transit guides are
available and worth asking for.
Vancouver's downtown is compact, with its trade and convention centre housed
in Canada Place, a be-sailed architectural curiosity which sits on a
peninsula in Burrard Inlet. It houses the Japanese-owned Pan Pacific Hotel.
The Waterfront Center hotel, built in 1991, is just across the street. For
vintage charm, try the Hotel Georgia, in the heart of downtown, or the Hotel
Vancouver. The Sheraton, Ramada and Holiday Inn hotel chains offer
well-located, more moderately-priced rooms, often with great mountain views.
For night-life, try strolling down Robson Street, a lively mix of coffee
houses, galleries, shops and open-air markets. The city's Asian cultures are
visible everywhere, but Chinatown offers delightfully varied cuisines.
Gastown, near the juncture of Cambie and Water Streets, also boasts trendy
restaurants and cafes.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (11): Be patient
and have fun - Damien Fraser advises visitors to take Mexico City on its own
terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIEN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST, oldest, probably most chaotic, and certainly most polluted
place in North America is Mexico City. The business, political and cultural
capital of Mexico accounts for 38 per cent of the country's gross domestic
product, some 30,000 industries, and is home to around 15.3m Mexicans.
Mexico City has now become a magnet for foreign businessmen, with the
country having torn down trade barriers some seven years ago.
Unfortunately its infrastructure has not improved to meet the flood of new
businessmen. It has just one, over-stretched airport, a handful of
over-booked hotels, and at most a dozen top-class restaurants. Mexican
telephones are terrible; and only a very brave, or over-confident, foreigner
would rent a car and try to find his way around the sprawling capital.
Despite growing economic integration between Mexico and the US, Mexican
business customs also remain sharply different from those in the US. Many
Mexicans are suspicious of the telephone, which means meetings have to be
scheduled even when a phone call would suffice. Punctuality and conciseness
are not national characteristics.
But for the foreigner willing to put up with a few cultural differences,
business can be rewarding and fun. Mexicans are generous, good-humoured and
like to mix business with pleasure (and vice versa), so meetings can easily
turn into lunches and dinners, or weekends, and contacts into friends.
The businessman invariably starts off at the chaotic international airport,
unless he has his own airplane, in which case he will have to land some way
away, at Toluca. Hundreds of porters and freelance taxi drivers will be
ready to help the newly arrived, but the best advice is to head straight for
the official taxi booths and buy a pre-paid ticket for the
government-controlled taxi service.
There are no luxury hotels in Mexico City, though several are being built.
The Camino Real, in the smart district of Polanco, is probably the most
fashionable.
If patience is not your virtue, the Japanese-owned and decorated Hotel
Nikko, also in Polanco, the brand new and garish Marquis Reforma (with the
best gymnasium) or the Galeria Plaza, both in the busy Pink Zone, are a
little more efficient, if a bit dull.
Setting up appointments in Mexico can be trying, as working hours vary from
office to office, and sometimes within offices. Some companies in the
private sector (Cifra) open at 8.30am and close at 5.30pm, taking an hour
off for lunch. Others, such as the government, open at (roughly) 10am. take
three hours for lunch between 3 and 6pm, and work to 9pm or later. Many
more, like Telmex, the telephone monopoly, seem to have half their staff
working on private sector hours, and another half on government hours.
To make matters worse, many executives and government officials have several
offices dotted around town, and practically all have scores of secretaries,
personal assistants, advisers, and heads of advisers, to screen them from
unwelcome advances.
Try to make your call before 11.30am - after that it may be too late, as the
day has taken on its own logic. And remember that, if you have no luck in
getting through, it's probably because you're not wanted. When they want to
say yes, Mexican businessmen and government officials can be quite as
efficient as their US counterparts, or more so. But if they want to say no,
many prefer to say nothing.
The first appointment is breakfast, which could start any time between 8.00
and 9.30am. Try your hardest to make the booking in your hotel. Since lunch
is so long, breakfast is recommended, if you don't think the conversation
will or should last two hours or more. Breakfast is heavy and, like
everything in Mexico, comes with spicy sauces, so beware.
After breakfast, appointments start. If you mind being late, don't try and
schedule more than one every other hour; if you don't mind about lateness,
schedule as many appointments as you can, and see how the day evolves.
Lunch can start at any time between 2.00 and 3.30pm, and will go on for a
couple of hours or more, though, as with a number of Mexican habits, a
growing number of Americanised executives are cutting it short. Best
restaurants include the pricey Champs Elysees (politicians) and the more
relaxed Bellinghuasen in the Pink Zone; Isadora (business types) and Estoril
(business types and politicians), in Polanco; and San Angel Inn, in the
south (tourists).
If you have had something to drink, and if you head feels dizzy, it's
probably because of altitude, rather than the ubiquitous yellow smog that
covers the city in winter months. Still, doctors warn against vigorous
exercise when the pollution count reaches dangerous levels, as it nearly
always does.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (8): Protest groups
lose support - How the Swiss dealt with the Schweizerhalle disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ANY CONVERSATION in Basle about the chemical industry and the environment
inevitably revolves around November 1 1986.
That Saturday, in the early morning, Baslers were awoken by the sounds of
sirens and an acrid stench that would last for several days.
A fire had broken out at a chemicals warehouse at Schweizerhalle, a suburb
of Basle on the Rhine, owned by Sandoz, one of four major chemical companies
based in the city.
The smell was bad enough, but it soon became apparent that an environmental
disaster of much greater proportions was occurring. As firemen pumped water
onto the fire in the warehouse, it mixed with the chemicals and some 30
tonnes of dangerous agricultural chemicals, including 200kg of mercury, were
washed into the Rhine.
A great deal of marine life, especially eels, was killed. Although no human
life was lost, the fire could have led to widespread deaths through a
release of phosgene.
Today, nearly seven years later, the repercussions of Schweizerhalle can
still be felt, although, perhaps surprisingly, they are much more of a
social and psychological nature than environmental.
Sandoz contributed SFr10m towards an exhaustive series of studies of the
Rhine ecosystem, and at a concluding symposium last year, the general
conclusion was that no lasting damage had been caused by the accident.
And, on the basis of exhaustive on-site investigations, Sandoz and the other
chemical and pharmaceutical companies in the area still insist that the
company had not been guilty of negligence or of low safety or environmental
standards.
Rather, the disaster showed an unquestionable need for containment tanks
around chemical warehouses, something that no one until that time had
recognised. Since Schweizerhalle, chemical companies throughout the world
have invested heavily in containment systems and a new standard has been
established.
It also revealed a general ignorance about techniques for removing toxic
chemicals from contaminated earth. Sandoz, to its credit, has developed a
successful international line of business in this area.
But by far the most important impacts of Schweizerhalle have been on the
cultures of the companies themselves and their relationships with the people
of their home city.
At heart, Basle is still a genteel trading centre at one of the more
important crossroads of western Europe. An uninformed visitor wandering
through the elegant old city, or sitting on the leafy edges of the Rhine as
it passes through the town centre, would have no idea that four huge
chemical complexes are only a few hundred metres away.
Officials of the four, Ciba, Roche and Lonza, as well as Sandoz, are at
pains to say that they were investing heavily in safety and environmental
protection long before the Schweizerhalle accident, and that is undoubtedly
true. Sandoz claims its first safety officer was appointed in 1951.
However, they willingly acknowledge that their attitudes toward their
surrounding community prior to the accident were characterised mainly by
patronising arrogance.
The people of Basle were also at fault. Basking in the extraordinary
prosperity produced by the companies - Basle is the second richest city in
Switzerland - they were for the most part content to accept assurances that
every precaution was being taken to protect them.
All that came to an end on November 1 1986. In the weeks after the fire, the
companies frequently made petulant and self-serving statements in an attempt
to play down the significance of the disaster. Angry residents called the
companies murderers and, on one occasion, threw dead fish from the Rhine at
Sandoz officials.
'The over-reaction showed that something was wrong in the relationship,' a
Roche official says.
Gradually, the companies realised the need to change, and they now have
exemplary programmes for involving the public in their activities.
All of them, for example, encourage visits from local residents to their
plants. 'Every week we have groups of teachers, students, politicians,
journalists and schoolchildren. Before we showed them pill-pressing - now
it's high-temperature incinerators and waste treatment plants,' says Dr Hans
Kunzi, director of corporate safety and environmental protection at Roche.
Neighbourhood meetings are frequent, and residents are invited to comment on
company plans and projects. At Ciba, for example, a planned refurbishment of
the Klybeckhof office building was substantially modified two years ago
because of residents' concerns about traffic flow and noise from
ventilators.
There are still significant differences in the companies' disclosure
policies, reflecting the differing cultures. Ciba is the most open,
providing a vast array of statistics on its emissions. Plant managers are
encouraged to carry an 'Oekogenda', containing many of these statistics and
indicating targets to be achieved.
Sandoz, on the other hand, is wary about publishing statistics wholesale,
preferring to release them in seminars so it can explain the context. 'We
feel that publishing statistical data does not really help in the
communications process. Naked figures are hard to understand,' Mr Jurgen
Muller, head of Sandoz Technology, says.
But all the companies have the same aim. As Mr Kunzi puts it: 'You can only
work in an environment where you are considered to be a neighbour. We want
to be a better and decent neighbour. The alternative is to move somewhere
else.
'Having a good image is also important for personnel marketing - if your
name is ugly and smelly, you are going to have difficulty recruiting young
people,' he adds.
Have these programmes worked? The consensus in the city is that there is
still a high level of scepticism among the public, but that is seen as not
necessarily a bad thing.
'The relationship is more mature. Today, everyone knows this is a dangerous
industry, but they also know that the companies are doing everything they
can to minimise the dangers,' says Mr Stefan Cornaz, a director of the Basle
Chamber of Commerce responsible for environmental issues.
Mr Cornaz and others point out that at the last city elections in early
1992, candidates who were less hostile to the industry than their
predecessors were successful.
Environmental protest groups admit that they now have less support than they
did in the aftermath of Schweizerhalle. Two years ago, Ms Florianne Koechlin
successfully led a campaign to block Ciba's application for planning
permission for a genetic engineering research facility. Today, she says, it
would be more difficult.
'The problem now is recession and a more industry-friendly government.' And,
she admits, 'the industry is more effective.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (7): Lessons of
Mersey oil spill - Profile, Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANCHESTER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sunny August weekend in 1989 has proved a turning point in one company's
attitudes towards the environment. A corroded pipeline carrying thick,
Venezuelan crude oil from Birkenhead to Shell's refinery at Stanlow,
Ellesmere Port, burst.
The spillage of 157 tonnes into an already badly polluted River Mersey was
tiny by the standards of an Amoco Cadiz or an Exxon Valdez but it soon
assumed massive proportions.
The pipeline was 17 years old and could not accommodate modern 'pigs' -
pipeline inspection gadgets sent down the inside to test it with scanners.
Shell engineers made a temporary repair and then - against the advice of the
emergency services - tried to empty out the rest of the oil by pumping it
past the leak.
If it had worked, hindsight would have classified the decision as sound and
professional. But the repair burst and the fire brigade videoed the
consequences as a fountain of 40 tonnes of oil sprayed onto the Mersey
foreshore. The video ended up on television and as evidence in court six
months later.
Shell pleaded guilty to polluting the Mersey and was fined Pounds 1m, the
largest penalty levied in an English court in a pollution case. Mr Justice
Mars-Jones said human error was to blame and Shell had not discharged its
duty to the community.
Only the company's support for arts and worthwhile projects in the region -
plus Pounds 1.4m paid without question for the ensuing clean-up - had saved
it from a penalty of several million pounds.
Shell paid up and shut up. Only now - and for the first time - has it been
prepared to talk about the impact of the incident, and the far-reaching
consequences it has had on the company.
Immediate action included modifying the pipeline so it could take 'pigs' to
enable modern testing. The previous method - filling the pipe with water,
increasing the pressure and waiting to see if it held - could not predict
failure. The Pounds 100,000 cost of modification was probably cheap, as
another fault was discovered, enabling another potentially fracture to be
averted.
But this was firefighting - and no different from what Shell had been doing
at Stanlow for years. Management responded to incidents after they had
occurred. There was an acceptance that pollution was inevitable; there would
always be spillages into waterways, black emissions up chimneys, and bad
smells to annoy local residents.
Everyone knew how these things happened, but the cost of the Mersey clean-up
and the opprobrium attaching to the Pounds 1m fine made Shell realise it had
to start asking why.
As Mr John Davies puts it: 'As a site we had a severe waking-up. We looked
hard at ourselves and realised management systems were either poor or
inefficient. This was something of an admission for something of our size.
We were managing things as they came up.'
Mr Davies is in charge of Shell's anti-pollution drive but the significance
of this can only be appreciated from his overall role in the business - he
is total quality services manager and one of Stanlow's most senior figures.
Above him is Mr Dominic Boot, director and general manager. Mr Boot, who is
from the Netherlands, became Stanlow's chief executive after the oil spill
and has experience of the much tougher environmental regimes of France and
Germany.
Initial suggestions for eliminating pollution were to spend, but Stanlow's
management soon ran into a problem. Founded in 1922, the gigantic complex
grew by adding on plant from 1948 to reach its present throughput of 10m
tonnes of oil a year.
This history of piecemeal development makes it harder to achieve the overall
operational standards of its more modern counterparts, so although it is one
of the largest refineries in Europe, Stanlow struggles financially. Big
spending on anti-pollution equipment that offered no return on capital was
going to be very hard to justify, especially in a recession.
'The message from the top was that we had to make what we had work properly,
rather than spend money we had not earned,' Mr Davies says.
Mr A. 'Jag' Jagannathan, technical development manager, echoes this:
'Throwing money at the problem is not enough. Merely correcting mistakes is
not the answer; it's not making the mistakes in the first place.'
Mr Boot, who was clearly brought in to shake the place up, says: 'It's all
in the mind in the end. The perception was that the oil industry had to be
dirty; that unless you had dirty boots and dirty fingernails, you were not
doing a proper job. But I had seen how the industry was elsewhere. A
refinery could be clean.'
Stanlow now is, because attitudes have changed from the top of the company
down to operator level. Mr Boot elevated the whole status of the environment
as a management responsibility, ranking it alongside quality, health and
safety.
Environmental policy, and how to plan it properly, became a standard agenda
item at weekly management meetings. Mr Boot associated himself personally
with the change, committing his reputation to new standards that he wants
achieved.
The objective is to make Stanlow hydrocarbon-tight. To achieve it, Mr Boot
says 'management has to be serious. The environment is not just a public
affairs issue.'
If the workforce did not take this seriously at first, attitudes changed
after management shut down one plant when equipment stopped adjusting the
acidity of effluent in the way it was supposed to. It took a week to solve
the problem, but the action demonstrated that the environment was as
important as safety in deter- mining whether things could go on if they were
not right.
Mr Mike Sparshott, environ- mental manager, now has the figures to prove
that the policies are working. For example, oil lost to effluent - in effect
dribbling into the Mersey - is down from an annual 390 tonnes to 130 tonnes.
The loss of biological oxygen caused by effluent is down 12 per cent.
Incidents of smoke emissions are down 15 per cent but the aggregate time of
emissions has been halved - meaning that operators act faster than in the
past to stem any trouble.
This is borne out by complaints about smoke dropping by nearly 40 per cent -
suggesting many incidents that attracted attention in the past are being
nipped in the bud before anyone outside notices.
The key outcome, however, is that Shell now feels any money it spends on
environ- mental improvements - and it could be up to Pounds 75m - will not
be wasted.
Without a change in corporate culture and attitudes, however, Shell would
have had to spend much more - and with less certainty, as old attitudes and
practices would have continued to create potentially worse pollution
problems at source. This might even have raised questions about whether
Shell should persist with Stanlow at all.
Just as important as any environmental improvements, however, is that Shell
has decided it should talk about it. It has not tried to pass off the Mersey
oil spill as bad luck, even though there was an element of chance involved,
but has admitted the more important part played by bad management.
It takes courage to eat humble pie and admit past errors so openly. Other
oil and chemicals companies may well shudder at this, just as they did when
Shell's pipeline burst, for something similar could have happened to almost
any of them.
Quietly, but urgently, they also modified old pipelines to take 'pigs'.
Shell at Stanlow now appears to have given another type of example to
follow.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (9): Chlorine
industry fights back - Scientific evidence supports opposing arguments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOWHERE ARE opposing views more entrenched than in the argument now raging
between environmental campaigners and the chlorine industry.
Environmentalists, led by groups such as Greenpeace, demand that all
chlorine production should cease immediately because the chemical and its
many derivatives cause serious harm to people, animals and the environment.
That is misinformed nonsense, says the industry. Chlorine gives many
benefits to society and will remain a fundamental building block of
industrial chemistry.
The middle ground is difficult to find even though both sides use the same
body of scientific evidence to support opposing arguments.
Until quite recently, the campaigners had chlorine makers and users in full
retreat. For example, paper and pulp manufacturers, traditionally some of
the biggest users, have moved or are changing to alternative bleaching
agents.
Furthermore, a significant number of governments in Europe introduced bans
on the use of PVC plastic in building projects. PVC contains chlorine. Some
large retailers began to look for alternatives to PVC packaging.
But after initial confusion, the chlorine industry has responded to the
threat and its public relations is fighting back amid genuine attempts to
clean up its production processes.
'It is making definite moves to put its house in order, although the
environmental pressure has not eased,' says Mr Stephen Harriman of Harriman
Chemsult, a London-based consultancy.
Mr Jan Wesseldijk, president of Akzo Chlor-Alkali and chairman of Euro
Chlor, a trade body, says the industry takes its environmental
responsibilities seriously.
'Perhaps we have been slow to respond to increased communications needs and
have neglected to highlight the actions already taken to safeguard society.
The way forward lies in investment in research and positive action to
demonstrate and reassure the public.'
Such assurances are badly needed, mainly because some of the suspected
side-effects of chlorine are horrific. The chemical has been implicated in
virtually every environmental nightmare, from the depletion of the ozone
layer to reduced sperm count in men.
In its elemental form, chlorine is a gas formed by passing electricity
through common salt. For every tonne of chlorine made, the process produces
just over a tonne of caustic soda, which is used in industrial processes and
to make detergents.
Chlorine and its derivatives, such as sodium hypochlorite, are used
throughout the world to disinfect drinking water. But most chlorine is used
in the manufacture of a vast range of products, such as drugs, pesticides,
plastics and industrial chemicals. Some of these retain chlorine at the end
of the process, while others do not.
Some chlorinated products, such as DDT (a pesticide), PCB (an insulating
liquid) and CFCs, have been implicated in global environmental problems. And
dioxins - considered to be one of the world's most dangerous group of
poisons - can be created when chlorinated substances, such as PVC and PCB,
are burnt at low temperatures. (Dioxins are also formed when other
non-chlorinated substances, such as wood and tobacco, are burnt).
Furthermore, the traditional method of making chlorine involves mercury, and
small but sometimes dangerous quantities of the metal are emitted as waste
into rivers and seas.
But chlorine is an integral part of modern life and contributes to the
health and wealth of society. Its disinfectant properties, for example, are
unsurpassed in the treatment of drinking water. This is especially true in
developing countries where alternative methods, such as ultra-violet light
and ozone, are not practical.
In 1991 the total production of chlorine in Europe was 9m tonnes, giving the
industry an estimated worth of between ECU 100-120m a year, according to
Euro Chlor.
Only small amounts of elemental chlorine are sold on the open market. Most
of the production goes straight to an associated plant that uses the
chemical to produce other products. About half of the European production is
used to make plastics.
The most popular plastic is PVC, which is made by reacting ethylene -
derived from oil with chlorine. PVC is used, among other things, as
packaging, to insulate electrical equipment and to make window frames. Other
plastic made with the use of chlorine include polyurethanes, polycarbonates
and epoxy resins.
Chlorine is also used as an intermediate in the production of titanium
dioxide (the white pigment in paint and toothpaste) and silicones.
Chlorinated solvents, such as perchloroethylene and methyl chloroform, are
widely used as cleaning agents in industry.
Only a small amount (not more than 6 per cent) of the world's total chlorine
production is used to purify water.
Environmental campaigners have successfully highlighted the possible health
risks from the use and disposal of some chlorinated products. Among these
are the creation of dioxins when PVC is burnt in municipal incinerators and
the production of potentially harmful byproducts when chlorine reacts with
other substances in the environment.
The industry has answers for most of the accusations made against it, but
the campaigners' position is strengthened by chlorine's involvement in
pollution incidents where there is no disagreement about the environmental
damage caused. These include CFC's role in the depletion of the ozone layer
and the harmful affect of DDT and PCBs.
'The chlorine industry is aware now that the end of the road is nigh - it
just depends on how long they can spin it out,' says Ms Madeleine Cobbing of
Greenpeace.
Mr Harriman says it will be difficult for the industry to find new uses for
chlorine to replace the eroded parts of its market. 'In the paper and pulp
market the environmental lobby has certainly won.'
But he says the environmental pressures have yet to break the historical
cycle of the chlorine market. 'The perception that chlorine is in decline is
incorrect. For example, the recent upturn in the US economy has already
increased the demand for chlorine there to a point where it is outstripping
supply.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom turnover rises
14.3%

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM, the German state-owned telecommunications monopoly,
recorded a 14.3 per cent rise in turnover to DM54bn (Dollars 33.8bn) for the
year to December 31 1992.
The rise was mostly due to its increased activities in former east Germany,
where turnover rose to DM3.5bn from less than DM1bn the year before. The
sales increase was also attributable to a rise in phone calls to foreign
countries, the company said.
After-tax results fell by DM250m in 1992 to DM6.45bn, mostly due to the cost
of servicing the company's DM100bn debt burden. Interest rates on its
outstanding loans in 1992 amounted to DM7bn.
The company will transfer about DM5bn of its after-tax revenues to the
federal government and DM1.5bn to the postal services and the post bank.
Deutsche Telekom has committed DM60bn until 1997 to modernising the basic
voice services in the east and installing a mobile telephone network. In
1992, investments in the east reached DM11bn, out of a total investment of
DM31bn for the whole country.
Last year, the company installed 760,000 lines in eastern Germany and
modernised 170,000 lines.
Deutsche Telekom intends to reach 7.2m clients in the east with basic voice
services by 1997, install 5m cable outlets for television and 400,000 lines
for fax machines. An additional 70,000 public phones are planned as well as
50,000 lines for data transmission.
The company is building its mobile phone network both in the east and the
west, where its is competing with Mannesmann, the German engineering and
telecoms group.
Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, chairman, called on politicians to push through the
privatisation of the company to allow managerial improvement and access to
the capital market.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke sales decline
5.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and machinery group, reported half-year
group sales falling by 5.1 per cent to DM3.37bn (Dollars 2.03bn), down from
DM3.56bn for the same period the previous years.
Sales in its steel subsidiaries, Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl, fell
by 12.3 per cent to DM1.08bn for the six months to March 31.
The company, which recently gained approval from creditors to write off
DM1.4bn of its DM2.7bn net debt, refused to comment on its operational
losses. In the steel divisions, analysts estimate losses at more than
DM200m.
Group sales in Germany fell by 9.7 per cent while sales abroad went down by
a modest 0.2 per cent. However, in the machinery divisions sales for the six
months rose by nearly 2 per cent to DM1.035bn.
Sales in its synthetic material division fell by 3.9 per cent to DM1.261m.
The two divisions each account for a third of total turnover.
Industrial orders for its steel divisions fell by 15.7 per cent to DM1.511bn
and by 6.8 per cent in its synthetic materials to DM1.257bn. The sharpest
fall was recorded in its machinery branch where orders dropped by more than
a third to DM827m.
Under the debt rescheduling procedure, a legal step short of bankruptcy
proceedings, the company has pledged to pay a third of distributable profits
over the next eight years to creditors writing-off up to 60 per cent of
their loans.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Bond bailed on charges over Manet
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Perth businessman, has been released on ADollars
200,000 (Pounds 88,000) bail after appearing in the Perth Court of Petty
Sessions yesterday on charges relating to the use by Bond Corporation, his
former corporate flagship, of a valuable Manet painting.
Mr Bond appeared on four charges laid by the Australian Securities
Commission (ASC) following investigations into events in 1988 and 1989
involving the painting, La Promenade.
The court ordered that Mr Bond, who was not required to plead, appear again
on August 12. It also ordered that Mr Bond surrender any passport not
already held by his trustee in bankruptcy and notify the federal director of
public prosecutions before applying for return of his passport or permission
to travel.
In part, the ASC charges allege that Mr Bond, with intent to deceive or
defraud, failed to notify the board of Bond Corporation (since renamed
Southern Equities) of an opportunity to acquire La Promenade at a cost
substantially less than market value.
The ASC also alleges that Mr Bond gave Bond Corporation directors
information he knew to be false and permitted the furnishing of false
information to an auditor of the company.
The ASC said in a statement yesterday that the La Promenade investigation
had been lengthy and complex and had been conducted in conjunction with the
federal police.
In a statement released after the hearing, lawyers for Mr Bond claimed he
was being singled out, and would vigorously deny the charges.

FT  18 JUN 93 / 'Pepsi-tampering' likely to be hoax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pepsi-tampering mystery began unravelling yesterday as several claims of
objects found in cans were pronounced hoaxes, AP reports from New York. At
least two people were arrested.
Police said at least three other people had recanted. And some experts said
it was likely that all the cases would turn out to be hoaxes, perpetrated by
people who were out for money, attention or thrills.
Pepsi-Cola has suggested as much itself, saying it is virtually impossible
to tamper with soda cans at its bottling plants.
'This development reinforces what we've believed all along - that this is
not a manufacturing problem and that consumers should not be alarmed about
any alleged problems with Pepsi products,' President Craig Weatherup said in
a statement.
A man has been arrested and accused of taking a hypodermic needle out of the
trash and claiming he found it in a Pepsi can. He could get up to five years
in prison on federal charges of making of a false report. A 21-year-old man
was also arrested after investigators with the Food and Drug Administration
concluded his claim of finding a needle was false.
A woman in California admitted she had broken a sewing needle into pieces
and put two in a Pepsi can, police said.
Police in Covina, California, said a woman there confessed that she had
fabricated her story about finding a syringe in a Pepsi.
'It seems obvious that some of these tamperings are faked - and in the
dumbest of ways. It won't be a surprise to me if all of them turn out to be
faked,' said Dr Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist in Newport Beach,
California. He is a consultant to the FBI in tampering cases.
The first report came on June 9, when an 82-year-old man in Tacoma,
Washington, said he looked into a can of Diet Pepsi to see if he had won a
prize and found a syringe.
Soon after, similar reports came pouring in. Local media accounts indicated
that at least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 states had been made by
Wednesday night.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Collorgate protagonists breast moral tide: Despite public
outrage, no-one has even been indicted yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE YEAR after the start of investigations which culminated in the
impeachment of Brazil's President Fernando Collor on corruption charges, the
alleged protagonists continue to enjoy their freedom. This is despite new
evidence suggesting that the scandal involved billions rather than millions
of dollars.
But, stung by unfavourable comparisons with Italy, where hundreds of
politicians and businessmen have been hauled before the courts and put
behind bars, Brazil's lumbering justice system is finally starting to move.
Since Tuesday, the Supreme Court has been holding daily interrogations of
the main characters in the 'Collorgate' scandal. It was the first time that
a former head of state had been questioned by the court, and Mr Collor
described his four-hour session as 'absolute humiliation'.
For many of the population who participated in last year's 'Pro-morality
Movement' to oust Mr Collor, the timidity of the criminal process has
reinforced the impression that corruption and immunity from prosecution
reign amid the Brazilian elite even after impeachment.
Few believe Mr Collor or his associates will go to jail and a recent public
opinion survey revealed that 86 per cent of the population believed that
crime was likely to go unpunished. A Supreme Court official retorts that
with just 7,000 judges for a population of 150m they simply do not have
enough manpower to act more quickly.
Yet the Collorgate scheme now appears to have been much larger than
originally thought. New evidence emerging from investigations by police and
Kroll Associates, the international accounting firm, estimate the total
amassed by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged ringleader, as Dollars 1.4bn.
Police allege that a large part of this came in bribes from overseas
suppliers of Petrobras, the state oil company, paid into New York and then
transferred to Swiss banks.
Although federal prosecutors have accused more than 100 people of
involvement, including Ms Zelia Cardoso, a former finance minister, not one
has been tried, jailed or even indicted. Businessmen who admitted to paying
kickbacks continue to do business.
Ironically, the only person to be jailed so far is an American mechanic, Mr
William Black, who is serving a sentence in the US for falsifying documents
for Mr Farias's Miami-based air leasing company.
Nor has a new, visibly cleaner, Brazil emerged. Lobbyists are back in the
ministries, tax evasion continues unabated, and businessmen say commissions
are still essential to secure contracts, though they have fallen to more
'reasonable' levels.
Mr Jose Genoino, a congressman from the Workers' Party, complains: 'For lack
of will to capitalise on the pro-morality mood we're losing a historic
opportunity to carry out moral surgery on our institutions.'
But another Congressman questions the wisdom of an Italian-style clean-up in
a country which emerged from military rule just eight years ago. 'Can you
imagine how many people are involved? We're talking about all major
businessmen and politicians, judges, police. . . . our political system is
not strong enough to take it,' he said.
However, while corruption may continue, there have been changes in public
perceptions and increased vigilance over public figures by the local press.
Mr Innocencio Oliveira, president of congress and himself the subject of
controversy for allegedly using aid money to drill wells on his own land,
claims: 'Brazil has been transformed. There is far more rigour with public
money and there is not the least possibility of anyone known to be corrupt
being elected.'
As evidence of this, Mr Orestes Quercia, who had been front runner for next
year's presidential elections, recently resigned as leader of the country's
biggest party, after an avalanche of allegations that he had pocketed
millions of dollars during his term as Governor of Sao Paulo. Brazil's new
president, Mr Itamar Franco, puts honesty above everything and has already
sacked two ministers because of allegations of wrongdoing.
In his court appearance this week, Mr Collor again denied the corruption
charges, claiming that the money used for his personal expenses such as his
notorious 'Babylonic gardens' was part of the Dollars 25m left over from his
election campaign and a Dollars 4m loan from Uruguay. His insistence that he
was the 'victim of special interests' trying to thwart his economic reforms,
is weakened by the continuation of these policies under the present
government.
However, Mr Genoino says, 'if Collor is not brought to trial soon then we
can expect increasing questions over whether morality was really behind his
ouster'.

FT  18 JUN 93 / MPs bow to anger over incomprehensible tax form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when the Italian authorities had begun to instil in their fellow
countrymen the civic concept of paying taxes, they have scored a spectacular
own goal.
The tax form drawn up for this year's declarations is so complex that it has
provoked a chorus of protest and threats of non-payment.
As a result, parliament yesterday approved a slippage in today's deadline
for submitting tax returns - the notorious form 740 - and slashed the
normally stiff penalties for late submissions and incorrectly compiled
declarations.
Former premier Giuliano Amato has already issued a public mea culpa for the
contorted language and incomprehensible nature of the returns. Even by the
standards of Italian bureaucracy, the 1993 '740' is numbingly non-user
friendly as it attempts to guide the tax-payer through the assortment of
taxes, duties and benefit items.
By the calculations of one newspaper, Italians face paying up to 202
different taxes and stamp duties. Of these, 51 are payable to local entities
and 21 affect personal wealth and corporate earnings.
One television chat show host even brought on a poet this week to analyse
the dense language of the 740. But the poet was too beside himself with
anger over having to pay taxes to offer any advice on scanning.
In one of its rare popular acts of late, parliament this week wrung a
statement from Mr Franco Gallo, the finance minister, that in future tax
forms would be simplified.
Ironically, this was the first attempt by the authorities to clamp down on
evasion and convince Italians it was time to pay more taxes. In place is a
sophisticated model estimating notional average earnings of different
groups, and applying minimal tax demands on these earnings. Many employers
were discovered last year to be declaring earnings lower than that of their
employees] This was accompanied by an amnesty on unpaid back taxes.
The completion date, which has already slipped twice, has been put back to
July 15. Instead of paying up to 40 per cent of tax estimates as a penalty
for late submission, the fine was fixed yesterday on a sliding scale from 1
to 3 per cent up to July 15.

FT  18 JUN 93 / French count cost of bank's freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAKING the Bank of France independent is to cost the French state FFr36bn
(Dollars 6.46bn).
The sum is the depreciation in the value of France's foreign exchange
reserves since 1982, caused by the rise of the franc, largely against the
dollar.
Up to now, the depreciation has appeared as a charge against an exchange
rate stabilisation fund on the Bank of France's books. The state has then
been responsible for settling up with the bank to cover this fund. Where it
has not done so, the outstanding account has effectively been an
interest-free loan by the bank to the government.
Under a bill to make the bank independent, which the Balladur government is
piloting through parliament, and indeed under the Maastricht treaty, the
Bank of France will be forbidden to lend to the government in this way. The
central bank will, instead, write the country's foreign exchange reserves
into its own balance sheet, and assume the exchange risk on these reserves
itself.
An accompanying bill proposed by the cabinet this week would stop new
advances by the central bank to the government. To wipe the slate clean, it
would also require that the government start paying 5 per cent interest on
the FFr36bn and repay it to the Bank of France over the next 10 years.
Such revenue will help the Bank of France become financially, as well as
politically, independent. Commercial banks claim to be worried by the degree
to which the central bank can fund itself and its 17,000 employees. Some
banks have been arguing that so inefficient is the central bank that it
cannot 'break even' if it lets interest rates drop below 7 per cent. The
Bank of France counters that it might only go into the red if interest rates
fall, implausibly, to around 3 per cent.

FT  18 JUN 93 / NZ governor praises merits of independence for central banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE anti-inflation policies of New Zealand's independent central bank are
credible because any government decision to override its targets has to be
public and formal, its governor said in London yesterday.
Mr Don Brash has headed the Reserve Bank of New Zealand since its
independence was established by law in 1989. Its success in bringing down
inflation to 1 per cent has provoked discussion about its suitability as a
model for Britain.
In a speech to the European Policy Forum, Mr Brash said the New Zealand
experience had shown that 'under a Westminster style of government, central
bank independence can be reconciled with political accountability.' He
added: 'While we are sometimes described as the world's most independent
central bank, our governing legislation explicitly acknowledges the role of
government.'
The governor is personally responsible for meeting policy targets -
currently, for consumer price inflation between zero and 2 per cent - agreed
by the finance minister and Reserve Bank.
But the law also provides for government to change the targets. However, Mr
Brash said, there could be no 'secret, under-the-table instruction to allow
slippage from the price stability target.' The government must do so openly,
and new policy targets must be publicly agreed if necessary.
He said the override provision was a strength rather than a weakness. 'Where
trade-offs are to be made between or among policy objectives, it is vital
for good economic management that the nature of the choices being made are
well understood.'
Mr Brash said the override provision enhanced the credibility of the bank's
commitment to stable prices. 'If people are reluctant to believe that the
central bank is serious about tackling inflation, then the costs of meeting
this objective are likely to be much higher.'
The New Zealand system also allows for departure from the stable pricing
target in the event of unpredictable shocks, such as a sharp rise in oil
prices or an increase in the rate of value added tax.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Italian deputies back single round electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian parliament yesterday approved electoral reform for the chamber
of deputies with the adoption of a first-past-the-post system for most seats
in a single round of voting.
Parliament also decided to retain proportional representation for a quarter
of the seats in the chamber.
This means the principles of electoral reform for both houses of parliament
will be broadly similar. On April 18 a referendum on reforming elections to
the senate introduced majority voting for 70 per cent of the seats and
reserved 30 per cent for the traditional system of proportional
representation.
Although both houses of parliament will have to approve each other's
reforms, it now seems likely that new electoral laws will be in place before
the summer recess. But while the parties have begun to show a sense of
urgency on this score, they have yet to tackle the far more complex task of
redrawing constituency boundaries. Some politicians forecast this will take
up to four months.
The most contentious point so far had been whether to introduce a single
round of voting as in the British system or a second round run-off like the
French. In the event, a surprisingly wide majority opted for the single
round.
Those backing the latter were the four partners behind the Ciampi government
 -Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - plus the
populist Lombard League, the neo-fascist MSI, Mr Marco Panella's radicals
and the breakaway communists, Reconstructed Communism. Some Socialists voted
against the proposal but the main opponents of the single round were the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the Republicans, Greens
and Mr Mario Segni's referendum movement. The latter appeared to
miscalculate badly the strength of the single-round lobby.
The powerful line-up against the PDS position was partly tactical. The
parties feared the PDS would be able to rally considerable support on a
second round. But equally the vote represented a widespread view that second
round voting would permit an inconsistent patchwork of local alliances which
would undermine the stability of a parliamentary coalition.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Attali proposes EBRD shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, is proposing to create three new senior posts at the bank and
radically change the functions of a fourth, in a far-reaching management
reorganisation.
His most radical proposal, contained in a paper submitted to the bank's
board this week, is that the development and merchant banking departments
should be merged and then split into three 'operations departments',
covering north central Europe, south central Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
It would be supported by an operations services group which would deal with
co-operation funds and technical co-operation, co-financing, loan
syndication, education and training and the environmental appraisal group.
Each operations department would report to a new senior vice-president, who
would also have the title of chief operating officer. On Monday Mr Attali
told the 23 directors representing the 54 countries and agencies which own
the bank that Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's number two, had 'agreed in
principle' to be chief operating officer.
The board is deeply divided on whether to press ahead with the
reorganisation, and how quickly to do so. Some directors are concerned that
Mr Attali and board representatives from France, Germany and the UK want to
pre-empt a debate about whether Mr Attali should remain president.
Under Mr Attali's plan, one of the new operations departments would cover
north central Europe, with responsibility for Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
A south central Europe department would cover Hungary, Ukraine, Moldova,
Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia and Slovenia. The third
department would deal with Russia, Armenia, Georgia and the six central
Asian republics.
Mr Attali said the streamlining would have a number of benefits:
It would eliminate some duplication of activities between the current
merchant banking and development banking departments.
It would help the bank 'identify and ..respond to clients' priorities by
creating a clear interface with private enterprises, government and public
enterprises'.
It would 'ensure a more balanced allocation of effort and staffing resources
among countries'.
At present the EBRD's merchant banking arm concentrates on financing private
sector projects, while the development banking department deals with
improving the infrastructure of central and eastern Europe. However, a
review recently commissioned by Mr Attali complained that there was overlap
between the two departments and that too little attention was paid to the
needs of each country in EBRD assessments of projects.
Mr Attali also wants to create a second senior vice-presidency in charge of
the budget process, personnel and administration. This would probably be
filled by Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president in charge of development
banking.
The vice-president in charge of finance, Mr Anders Ljungh, would thus lose
responsibility for the budget and policy planning activities but retain the
treasury, credit and financial control functions.
Mr Attali also wants to create a new vice-presidency for external and
economic relations in an attempt to 'improve the bank's image and create a
favourable and supportive climate of political and public opinion'.
Mr Stern was asked whether he would become EBRD chief operating officer by
the senior finance officials from the G7 leading industrial countries.
The directors representing the European members of the G7, France, Germany
and the UK, argued on Monday that the reorganisation should be pushed
through as quickly as possible. However, most other directors resent what
they see as the G7's high-handed intervention. They believe any decision
should be delayed until after July 15, when the bank's audit committee
reports to the board on charges that the bank failed to control expenditure
on furnishing its London headquarters and other items.
Many directors are concerned the EBRD will evolve into the European arm of
the World Bank. They believe it is losing its unique identity of sponsoring
private sector development in the former Soviet bloc. They say the
reorganisation is a general policy decision needing two-thirds approval by
shareholders. The G7 countries control 54 per cent of the shares.

<TEXT>
THE tentacles of Italy's corruption scandal yesterday embraced Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group with the issue of a cautionary warrant against
one of its executives.
Mr Aldo Brancher, responsible for special projects at the Fininvest
communications subsidiary but understood to be a lobbyist, is being sought
by Milan magistrates for questioning about irregularities at the Ministry of
Health.
The warrant, for illegal funding of political parties, follows allegations
by Mr Giovanni Marone, secretary to a former health minister, that Fininvest
paid L300m (Dollars 200,000) in kickbacks on a television advertising
contract during the government's anti-Aids campaign.
The money allegedly went to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, a former health
minister, who this year resigned after his father, a prominent Naples doctor
and ex-politician, was investigated on corruption allegations. Magistrates
subsequently informed Mr De Lorenzo, a senior member of the small Liberal
party, he was under investigation in connection with a Naples jobs-for-votes
scandal.
The involvement of Mr Brancher in the corruption scandal is a big setback
for Mr Berlusconi, who has faced growing difficulties following a government
decision to re-examine Italy's controversial revision of broadcasting
frequencies. Fininvest, which controls three TV channels, has about 45 per
cent of the audience.
Mr Berlusconi has been complaining of a media campaign against him. In
recent weeks, he has been targeted by parts of the media controlled by Mr
Carlo De Benedetti, an arch-rival. The attacks followed reports that Mr
Davide Giacalone, an adviser to a former posts minister, subsequently
obtained a L420bn consultancy with Fininvest. Mr Giacalone assisted Mr Oscar
Mammi, the posts minister responsible for the broadcasting frequency
allocations now due to be re-examined.

FT  18 JUN 93 / German waste recycling is hit by success

GERMANY'S much-vaunted waste recycling system is collapsing under the weight
of its own success, collecting four times more plastic garbage than it can
recycle, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by German companies to collect and
recycle household waste, said it urgently needed DM500m (Dollars 300m) just
to keep going this year. Mr Wolfram Bruck, the company chairman, warned
yesterday that DSD could not ensure the recycling of the garbage it was
collecting and called for a complete rethink of the system.
Rhineland-Palatinate withdrew from the scheme this week, complaining that it
was 'collapsing under 8,000 tonnes of plastic garbage with nowhere to put
it'.
DSD was set up by industry two years ago after the introduction of an
environmental law which forces manufacturers to take back and recycle
packaging products.
While DSD has been successful in dealing with paper, glass and aluminium,
for which facilities already exist, it is failing to find adequate outlets
for plastics, which is costly and difficult to process.
By law, DSD was supposed to collect only 100,000 tonnes of plastics a year
until 1995, but the scheme has worked so well, it has found itself with four
times as much this amount.
With landfills in Germany full to the brink, DSD has now painted itself into
a corner until new recycling facilities are built. Investments are under
way, most notably by RWE, the large utilities company, but DSD says this is
not enough.
DSD is also criticising its own members for cheating on membership fees.
These fees allow member companies to put a green dot on their products,
which are then collected by DSD, sorted out and given to recycling
companies. DSD has widely portrayed the green dot, which figures on 80 per
cent of consumer packaging in Germany, as a friendly pro-environment
measure.
But the system's public image is now under strain as mountains of unrecycled
plastic garbage increasingly appear on German television. Moreover, the
company has been repeatedly attacked by green organisations for exporting
abroad the rubbish it cannot recycle.
More than half of the 400,000 tonnes of plastic collected by DSD in 1992
ended up in foreign landfills, especially in developing countries.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): Year of mishaps
ruins a caring reputation - Profile, Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE extraordinary series of mishaps suffered by Hoechst of Germany this
spring provides an awful warning of the way a reputation for responsible
care, built up over many years, can be destroyed in a few weeks.
After a period of 10 years in which Hoechst had not suffered a single
noteworthy accident at its German plants, and in which routine emissions of
many pollutants had been cut by 80 per cent or more, there were three
serious accidents and 15 lesser incidents between February 22 and April 2.
The events themselves would have bad enough to damage public confidence in
Hoechst, however the company had responded to them. They started with the
contamination of a Frankfurt suburb with 10 tonnes of toxic chemicals, were
punctuated in the middle with a lethal explosion that killed one worker and
seriously injured another, and finished with a leak of several hundred
kilograms of highly corrosive 'oleum' (fuming sulphuric acid).
But Hoechst made matters worse by its reaction, which was widely seen as
disorganised, defensive and arrogant. The legacy is an atmosphere of
mistrust and bitterness. The company has come under attack not only from its
natural adversaries in the environmental movement and the media but also
from the state and federal governments.
The environment ministry in the state of Hesse ordered an independent
scrutiny of Hoechst's whole safety and environmental management system, in
addition to investigations of the individual accidents. These could lead to
criminal charges and/or the loss of operating licences.
The indirect impact of the accidents has spread well beyond Hoechst's
Frankfurt-based operations, leading to calls for even tougher safety
controls for all German chemical plants. The industry's leaders have had to
suspend their campaign for some relief from Germany's ever-tightening safety
and environmental regulations which, they say, put them at a disadvantage
compared to competitors in other countries where rules are more relaxed.
A lot of the public relations damage was done by the first accident, at
Hoechst's Griesheim works, which sprayed a sticky and evil-smelling yellow
cocktail of chemicals over the nearby suburb. For several hours after the
incident, the company's PR staff seriously underestimated its impact on
residents, as a result of poor internal communications.
Later, the company tried to make amends. Several hundred Hoechst staff spent
the weekend after the accident helping residents to clean up contaminated
cars, homes and streets and arranging to remove tonnes of topsoil from their
gardens. They even bought up Germany's stocks of dogs' shoes - available in
small, medium and large - so that people could protect their pets' paws.
Public distrust was exacerbated by the fact that Hoechst officials did not
acknowledge that one of the main chemicals released - ortho-nitroanisole, an
ingredient in making dyestuffs - was potentially carcinogenic, until the
story reached the press. PR staff explained afterwards that they had not
known at the time about studies conducted under the US National Toxicology
Programme, which showed an increased incidence of tumours in rats and mice
given the chemical in their feed.
The company insisted there was 'no risk of permanent harm to residents of
Griesheim' because conditions there were quite different from those in the
long-term animal studies. But as Mr Jorg Geywitz, a Hoechst environmental
manager, pointed out, 'people see the chemical, they smell it and of course,
when they read in the newspapers about its toxicity, they're frightened.'
Another mistake, according to some observers, was that Mr Wolfgang Hilger,
chairman of Hoechst, gave no press conference and made no personal statement
about the accident until 10 days later. That gave an unfortunate impression
of aloof detachment on the part of senior management.
However Hoechst was responding more fully, more humbly and more quickly by
the time of the third serious accident on April 2, in which 13 workers
suffered the effects of exposure to sulphuric acid fumes. It was followed by
a decision to give the whole Hoechst board joint responsibility for safety;
one director, Mr Karl Holoubek, had previously been responsible.
A disconcerting feature of the series of accidents was that no common thread
ran through them, apart from human error and a failure to observe specified
operating conditions. There was nothing more specific for the company to put
right.
The first incident, for example, resulted from a night shift worker's
failure to switch on a stirrer in a reaction tank. That led eventually to an
uncontrolled build-up of pressure in the vessel - and the explosive release
of its contents into the atmosphere.
The accidents completely overshadowed Hoechst's annual announcement in April
of its environmental spending and performance figures, which showed that the
consistent improvement over the past 20 years had been maintained. The total
amount of chemical residues discharged from its main works into the Rhine
has declined from 263 tonnes in 1972 to 29.6 tonnes last year.
Hoechst spent DM1.3bn on environmental protection in 1992 (of which DM232m
was capital investment and the remainder running costs). About half of the
expenditure is to reduce water pollution.
It will be a long time, however, before most people in Frankfurt think again
of Hoechst as a company with an excellent long-term environmental record,
rather than an accident-prone giant that needs tighter regulation.
