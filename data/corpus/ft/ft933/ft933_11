FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price upsurge boils over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LONDON robusta coffee market rode a roller-coaster yesterday, hitting a
2 1/2 -year high on news that Brazil had arranged financing for its stocks
under the producers' retention scheme, and then plummeting to close lower in
a wave of profit-taking.
The November robusta futures contract peaked at Dollars 1,325 a tonne in
early trading, the highest level since the dollar contract began trading in
March 1991 and a rise of nearly 100 per cent since its low of Dollars 670 in
the summer of 1992.
It was a direct response to the sharp rise in arabica futures prices in New
York on Friday, which followed news that the Brazilian government would buy
the coffee that its producers had to withhold from the market from next
month.
Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, and the move helped underpin
the growing credibility of the scheme, which now embraces Latin American,
African and Indonesian producers in a joint effort to raise prices.
However, no fresh news emerged during the day and profit-takers moved in,
sending the price to a close of Dollars 1,264 a tonne, Dollars 32 down on
the day. New York failed to build on its gains of Friday, with the December
contract at Dollars 81.85 cents a lb, down Dollars 1.30, in late trading.
'The speed with which London turned tail and ran was a bit of a surprise,'
said one trader.
'They all tried to take profits at the same time and there was a bit of a
scramble.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lean times for EC pig farmers -
Farmer's Viewpoint / Most producers are losing at least Pounds 7 on every
bacon pig they rear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIGS, say traditionalists, were always copper or gold. At present, they are
hardly copper. I do not know the metallic equivalent of a deficit, but that
is what most of us in the pig production business are currently
experiencing.
To produce, say, a bacon pig these days, costs the equivalent of 105p to
110p a kilogram, deadweight, depending on efficiency of production. Last
week, the UK average all pigs price, calculated by the Meat and Livestock
Commission on the basis of weighted averages of a range of markets, fell to
96.61p a kilogram, so most pig farmers are be losing about 10p a kilogram,
or at least Pounds 7 for every 70kg bacon pig they produce.
Within the next few days, the MLC will publish its forecast of the supply,
demand and price for pig meat for the next six months. It is already clear
that this is likely to be a gloomy document; and the commission will need to
explain why its previous forecast, in June, which suggested the AAPP would
stay above 100p a kilogram through the autumn, turned out to be too
optimistic.
One reason may be that there are more pigs in the production pipeline than
it expected. A recent Scottish survey showed that total pig numbers north of
the border had risen between June 1992 and June 1993 by 4.9 per cent. Even
more significantly there was an increase in the Scottish pig breeding herd
of 11.7 per cent. If this is a guide for the rest of the UK, and given that
it takes up to 10 months for a pig to be conceived, reared and slaughtered,
the problem of over-supply and therefore low prices could continue for some
time.
Pig farmers' difficulties will be made worse, moreover, by feed costs, which
have not fallen as much as they usually do in the post-harvest period and
are set to begin to rise again as early as October. Feed represents 75 to 80
per cent of the total cost of producing a bacon pig.
So prospects for coming months are not at all rosy and it is difficult to
see what could change that prediction. The lamb market, which boomed through
the summer and on the back of which the AAPP peaked at 117.76p per kg in
June, has now slumped. Supplies of pigs in most European Community countries
are also up on last year. Only the traditional Christmas trade for roasting
joints and hams, for which the meat trade will shortly be stocking-up,
provides a faint glimmer of hope.
But it is unlikely to restore the AAPP to profitable levels before
Christmas, and after the New Year there is, in any case, usually a seasonal
decline in the demand for and prices of pig meat.
Once again, therefore, virtually unsupported EC pig farmers must bear the
brunt of free market pressures until enough of them cut or get out of
production. Those of us who stick it out could well be losing money on every
pig we sell for many months to come.
But not all pig producers are so unfortunate. One slaughter-house and bacon
factory has introduced a contract to purchase pigs which evens out the peaks
and troughs of the open market and creates some stability. This is the
Malton Bacon Factory in north Yorkshire, which, according to its management,
has a culture committed to pig farmers.
It must, presumably, also be committed to its parent company, Unigate, which
has provided the capital for the factory to expand from killing 6,000 pigs a
week eight years ago to over 30,000. This has made it the biggest bacon and
processed pig meat business in Britain and one of the top half dozen in
Europe. The 1.5m pigs slaughtered at the factory each year represents about
12 per cent of the total UK kill.
The contract Malton has with its pig suppliers requires them to answer
questions about the breeding of the pigs they produce, the housing provided
for them, the welfare standards observed, the feed used, together with its
ingredients, and so on.
Pig farmers must also assure the factory that they are observing government
and EC regulations on such matters. And to monitor production methods
independently they are encouraged to join the Ministry of Agriculture's pig
health scheme.
In return for disclosing these details, which do not of themselves amount to
quality assurance but could clearly be tightened and modified in the future
to become just that, pig producers are offered contracts that can give them
a sizeable premium over the AAPP. To qualify for this, pig carcasses must,
of course, also have the required quality and leanness. But that is a
requirement of all pig slaughterers these days.
Last week, for instance, when the AAPP was 97.87p a kilogram, Malton was
paying 110p per kg for top grade carcasses. For lowest grade pigs, the
factory paid only 87p a kilogram last week, amounting to a penalty on
producers who failed to provide the quality required.
When pig prices rise, as they surely will again one day, Malton skims some
of the benefit to help pay for the premium during periods of low price. But
most producers are happy with that. They much prefer stability and
predictability.
Malton Bacon Factory also appears to have got the right approach to
retailers. It regularly supplies the supermarkets of Tesco, Safeway, Asda,
Iceland, Gateway and William Lowe, all of which are concerned to reassure
consumers of the quality standards and the safety of the food they supply.
Sales by the company now total some Pounds 250m a year, of which Pounds 40m
comes from exports. Malton is even exporting pig products to Denmark.
There can be little doubt that this kind of combination of quality assurance
for consumers, efficiency of production and processing and concern for
suppliers, is what is needed to help cut the UK's food trade gap, now
running at about Pounds 6bn a year. Sadly, there are too few such companies
bridging the gaps between farmers, the retail trade and the consuming
public.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Financial problems take the
bloom off a Colombian success story - Effective reversal of the country's
devaluation policy is eroding profit margins for the flower industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAZZLING displays of roses, carnations and chrysanthemums at Colombia's
recent flower fair brought approval from foreign buyers and so did
Colombia's success in adapting to an extremely competitive market.
Second only to Holland in flower exports, Colombia has increased sales
steadily over the past 20 years, earning more than USDollars 320m in 1992.
However, growers are glum about an effective reversal in devaluation, which
is eroding profit margins.
'In the past Colombia wasn't market driven. Now the industry is maturing,'
said Mr Rex Thompson of CCI farms, the US company that handles sales for one
of Colombia's biggest growers. 'Our own trend is to have a much wider range
of products - calla lilies, Queen Anne's lace and limonium, for example.
These were not traditionally produced here.'
Carnations and roses are still the mainstays, with 37 per cent and 24 per
cent of exports. But Colombian companies produce about 40 different types of
flowers. Its geographical position at the crossroads of Central and South
America, with habitats ranging from lowland rainforest to misty Andean
woodland, puts Colombia high in the world league of floral diversity.
Most of the flower plantations are about 2,500 metres up on the green plains
outside Bogota. Temperatures and the number of daylight hours fluctuate very
little, and there is only the occasional frost. Expensively heated
greenhouses are not necessary - flowers can be produced all through the year
under cheap plastic tenting.
'We have 4.200 hectares of flowers now and I think exports will grow by 8 to
10 per cent this year,' said Juana Maria Unda, president of the flower
exporters association, Asocolflores. 'But the overall area is not expanding
because of the economic situation. Eight companies have gone under - they're
only small ones but it's the first time this has happened, it shows the
effect of the revaluation of the peso in the last two years.'
The combination of revaluation (the devaluation rate is nearly ten points
below inflation) and greater competition from other countries is forcing
growers to look into their costs very carefully. Production is becoming more
intensive, with less space for paths and careful control of labour.
According to one medium-scale grower with 20 hectares, 'the margin is so
small that you must export greater volumes to get your income. We are trying
new varieties of carnation - but this year it's a question of just hanging
on.'
The flower plantations employ 75,000 people, mainly women who live in rural
areas and towns near Bogota. The heavy use of pesticides - required if
flowers are to meet most import standards - has caused health and
environmental problems. Growers are responding with stricter controls on
pesticide management and on the disposal of contaminated debris. They also
sponsor family welfare programmes, housing improvements and environmental
projects.
Women employed on the plantations say that standards vary widely from
company to company: 'Some have practically no security measures and even let
people take the waste to feed their animals. Then another company fired
somebody because she had a sweet in her overall pocket, and that was against
security regulations,' explained one worker.
'Nobody realised the flowers would use so much water. The spring where our
water came from is dry and buildings are cracking because there's no water
left in the earth,' she added.
Agrochemicals were very much in evidence at the fair - but so was protective
clothing. Airlines were also well represented. The increase in the number
and destinations of flights has been a boon to exporters who want to open up
European sales and send direct to US cities other than Miami. British
Airways flies over 20 tonnes of flowers a week to Britain, which has become
one of Colombia's biggest carnation markets. Three quarters of all flower
exports (about 80,000 tonnes) go to the US.
'The mass market is growing, there's been a lot of promotion. It's high
quality and very professional,' said Mr Thompson. 'Growers are opening up
their own American offices for marketing.' The Colombian Flower Council,
created by Asocolflores and the US importers, is trying to boost flower
consumption in the US all the year round.
But production still has to be geared primarily to certain dates, especially
St Valentine's Day and Mothers' Day.
Although Ecuador, Mexico and other Latin American producers are expanding,
Colombia has far more sophisticated infrastructure and the best agronomists.
At the same time, exporters have woken up to the need for more diversified
products and markets. Looking around the multi-coloured stands at the
Bogota' fair, a Dutch carnation specialist noted that all the main
international carnation and rose breeders were present - a good sign for
Colombia's prospects.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervous selling sends gold
price to 4 1/2 -month low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market continued on its downward spiral yesterday taking the London
bullion market price to its lowest level since mid-April.
Dealers attributed the Dollars 5.60 fall to Dollars 344.25 a troy ounce to
technical pressure. They said the breach of a support level at Dollars 348
an ounce had unleashed a fresh wave of selling.
Some thought the market would soon be steadied by a return of physical
demand, signs of which were discerned last week. But Ms Rhona O'Connell,
analyst at T. Hoare and Compnay, said yesterday there appeared to be no
follow-through to recent Far Eastern buying. She also noted that the
bargain-hunting that lifted the price after the Dollars 12.60 plunge last
Wednesday and Thursday had quickly dried up. On the other hand there was as
yet no sign of 'short' sellers trying to force the market lower, Ms O'Connel
said. 'The latest selling seems to have been liquidation.'
She did not rule out yesterday's breach of the Dollars 345-an-ounce mark
encouraging a test of support at Dollars 340, but suggested: 'At prices
below Dollars 350 gold represents good long term value'.
'The physical market, so strong at the start of the year, naturally weakened
as prices rose,' Ms O'Connell explained in a market report issued at the end
of last week.
'There are early signs of revival, but as yet the upturn has little
momentum.'
Meanwhile: 'The speed of downward spikes has been exacerbated by the
triggering of stops (stop-loss selling orders) on the futures market, which
has more than once left would-be sellers in the lurch as the market sailed
away from them.' This had left an overhang of potential investment fund
sales, she said, 'and the market is still nervous in the short term'.
Looking further ahead, however, Ms O'Connell saw the prospect of an upturn
in demand from jewellers in the 'Christmas stocking season'.
'Very few (jewellers) are hedged on the long side,' she said. 'There will be
strong demand for bullion as the season starts.'

London Metal Exchange COPPER prices edged away from their lows during late
trading and ended slightly higher. The imposition of a Dollars 5 a tonne
limit on the daily backwardation has defused much of the tightness and the
premium to borrow cash for one day was erased, with a 40 cent discount in
place at the close. TIN slid to new 20-year lows in sympathy with the Far
Eastern markets, but edged up slightly to close at Dollars 4,545 a tonne,
still down Dollars 62.50 on the day, in the three months position. The
NICKEL market paid little attention to mid-afternoon news Inco had reached a
tentative agreement with unions at its Thompson, Manitoba, operation. The
three months delivery price closed at Dollars 4,555 a tonne, down Dollars
65. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures edged higher in very
sedate fashion. The near December position closed at Pounds 867 a tonne, up
Pounds 11 on the day. 'I think the market is also (like coffee - see story
above) running out of steam at the moment but again in the long-term prices
look set to really push higher towards Pounds 1,000,' one trader said.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: D-Mark's slip dampens enthusiasm for bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark's slippage against the dollar and several European currencies
dampened demand for bunds, but helped boost prices in other continental
European markets.
After range-trading all day, German government bonds were sold towards the
close, with the December bund future hitting a low of 98.30 in after-hours
trading.
THE Belgian franc's recovery against the D-Mark boosted Belgian bonds, which
rose  3/8 point on the day. The franc was not dented by the Belgian central
bank's cut in its end-of-day rate to 12 per cent, which fuelled hopes for
further rate cuts.
The medium-dated sector outperformed the long end, and five-year Belgian
bonds now yield some 87 basis points over their German counterparts, down
from a spread of 107 basis points at yesterday's opening. The 10-year yield
spread shrank to 97 from 105 basis points.
FRENCH government bonds gained in the morning on growing hopes that the Bank
of France might cut its 6.75 per cent repo rate. However, when that rate was
left unchanged, 10-year bond prices eased from their highs to end only
slightly stronger. Two- and five-year notes fell slightly as traders set up
positions ahead of Thursday's new supply.
The franc's gains against the D-Mark underpinned sentiment and kept hopes
for a near-term easing alive, with some traders betting on a rate cut at
Thursday's repo operation.
UK GILT prices ended little changed after slipping back just before the
close of the market.
In an otherwise lacklustre trading day, the index-linked sector performed
well. The 2024 index-linked gilt ended 1 1/2 points higher, to yield 3.16
per cent, down from 3.23 per cent.
The Bank of England took advantage of the price surge to announce a Pounds
250m tranche of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2030 today.
AFTER resuming its upward trend late last week, the Treasury long bond
firmed slightly in quiet trading yesterday, as the market awaited today's
figures on August retail price inflation. Prices slipped at the short end,
however.
By the day's end, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 105
9/32 , yielding 5.871 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 1/16 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.808 per cent.
Traders yesterday were biding their time in anticipation of the government's
release of last month's consumer price index, expected to show retail prices
edging 0.2 per cent higher, following a 0.1 per cent increase in July and no
change in June.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Decks cleared ahead of Italian global
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISSUANCE in the international bond market yesterday was mainly restricted to
top-quality borrowers as the decks were cleared for the Republic of Italy's
global offering.
The dollar-denominated issue, which could be launched early tomorrow for
pricing on Thursday, is widely expected to raise Dollars 5bn. This would
break the current record of Dollars 3bn for a global bond offering.
Italy is thought to be considering a two-tranche structure for its first
global offering, one with a maturity of 10 years and the other with a
maturity of 30 years. The yield spreads being discussed in the market are
60-65 basis points for the 10-year tranche, and 80-85 basis points for the
30-year tranche.
Bankers said initial reaction from east Asian investors to the Italian
roadshow had been muted, but that it had strengthened in recent days. They
also reported that Italian treasury officials were encouraged by response
from the US.
This is the first opportunity for US domestic investors to buy dollar bonds
issued by Italy. The extent of their interest will determine the issue's
size.
Borrowers are queueing up to tap the Euromarket once Italy's offering is out
of the way. KfW, the triple-A rated German government agency for
redevelopment, is understood to be preparing a 10-year offering to raise
between DM1bn and DM1.5bn.
The offering, via Commerzbank and CSFB, is expected to be priced to yield 15
basis points over underlying German government bonds. This is roughly the
same spread at which KfW raised DM1.5bn through a 10-year deal last March.
The Japanese Development Bank is thought to be looking at the sterling
sector for its planned Eurobond offering. The market has been waiting for
JDB to raise the equivalent of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m in the
Euroyen sector. However, the sterling sector currently offers a swap into
yen which would enable JDB to narrowly beat its funding target. JDB last
launched a sterling Eurobond issue in 1988.
Among yesterday's issues, Kellogg, the US breakfast cereals group,
capitalised on its triple-A rating and its rarity value to achieve a spread
of just nine basis points over Canadian Treasuries for its CDollars 265m,
five-year Eurobond offering.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers said Kellogg had only launched five Eurobond
issues of more than Dollars 100m in the last 10 years. The proceeds of the
issue were thought to have been swapped into dollars.
Demand for the Council of Europe's eight-year Ecu150m Eurobond issue was
such that the bonds rose as high as 100 3/8 in the afternoon from their par
re-offer price. There has been a severe shortage of new issues in this
sector. Joint lead manager UBS said European retail investors were
particularly keen buyers of the bonds.
Investors looking for high-yielding paper in the French franc sector were
attracted to the five-year FFr750m Eurobond issue launched by Pemex, the
Mexican state oil company.
The bonds were priced to yield 212 1/2 basis points over underlying French
government bonds. They were not freed to trade by late afternoon.
Pemex, which raised FFr500m last year, is the only Latin American borrower
so far to have tapped this sector of the Euromarket.

TWO more western banks yesterday received licences to set up subsidiaries in
Russia as the Russian central bank attempted to head off a plan by
parliament to ban foreign banks from dealing with Russian customers.
Western bankers said that the central bank had confirmed general banking
licences for Credit Suisse and the Netherlands' ING Bank. This extends to
six the number of banks that have received permission to start operations in
Russia.
On Friday, parliament is due to decide whether to confirm a resolution
confining foreign banks to dealing with foreign clients from 1994 to 1996.
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, is thought to be trying
to present parliament with a fait accompli by giving licences to as many
foreign banks as possible before parliament takes a decision reversing the
terms of the licences.
Banque Indosuez is to close its Japanese share broking operations in Tokyo,
Reuter reports from Tokyo. This follows an earlier decision to shut its
Indosuez Capital Securities operation in London.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Reform will open Dutch bourse
to outside capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Amsterdam stock exchange will be allowed to participate for
the first time in the share capital of the bourse's 'hoekmen', or stock
jobbers, under proposals put forward yesterday.
A stock market committee said it was 'probably inevitable' that the hoekmen
firms would turn to other members of the exchange to help strengthen their
capital bases.
Although there will be no limits to the size of outside investment, the
hoekmen must retain their independence in day-to-day operations.
Among the obvious candidates for putting up money are Dutch-based banks
already active in bourse trading through their stockbroking subsidiaries.
However, the bourse's members also include subsidiaries of foreign banks and
brokers.
The proposals are a development in plans for sweeping reforms of the Dutch
stock exchange, due to take place early in 1994.
The reforms, which centre on plans to divide the market into retail and
wholesale segments, will mean that many of the 23 hoekman firms will
disappear, to be replaced by better-capitalised 'specialists' similar to
those on the New York Stock Exchange.
The bourse has said that no more than 10 specialists are expected to be
active in the retail segment of the market.
Each of the new-style specialists will have exclusive rights to trade in
specific stocks among Amsterdam's 30 most actively-traded companies.
Currently, several competing hoekmen tend to trade in the same stock.
The committee proposed yesterday that the top 30 companies be apportioned
among interested hoekmen according to each firm's past level of brokerage
fees in the stock.
Those hoekmen firms which decide to close down will receive the equivalent
of one year's total fees, based on average fees generated over the past 2.5
years. These sums will be paid by those hoekmen prepared to become
specialists.
The committee's proposals will be examined by the bourse's management next
month before being put to a general meeting of bourse members in November.
The overall bourse reforms, are designed to equip Amsterdam to beat off
competition from London.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank to be agent for
state bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German federal state of Lower Saxony will shortly issue bonds through
the state central bank of Bremen, Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, the
Bundesbank's regional branch in Hanover. It is the first time the Bundesbank
will act as an issuing agent for a state.
The Landeszentralbank will auction the bonds for Lower Saxony on October 5.
They are likely to have a 10-year maturity and will be listed on the Hanover
and Frankfurt stock exchanges, where the Bundesbank will engage in
market-smoothing operations. They will also be listed on the electronic Ibis
trading system, the state's finance ministry said.
It is hoped the issue, which is targeted at a wide range of investors, will
raise between DM1.5bn and DM2bn, said Mr Holger Kordt, a Treasury official
at the finance ministry.
Lower Saxony has a borrowing requirement of some DM10bn this year, about
half of which has already been raised. Most of it is being used to refinance
old debt.
Until now, Lower Saxony has issued Schuldscheine, or negotiated promissory
notes, and less liquid bonds, which are not actively traded and whose prices
are not usually tended by the central bank.
'We are hoping to offer investors an instrument that has high liquidity and
a government name,' said Mr Kordt. Lower Saxony planned to become a regular
borrower. 'This is not just a one-off issue; we hope to begin a steady flow
of issuance via the Bundesbank,' he said
Nevertheless, the bonds will be less liquid than bunds or Treuhand bonds,
whose issue size average about DM10bn. Nor will they be deliverable into the
bund futures traded in Frankfurt and London. Dealers expect them to yield
between 15 and 25 basis points over 10-year government bonds.
'I think it will remain largely domestic paper - it will be too small to
arouse big international demand,' said a Frankfurt analyst.

<TEXT>
COMPAQ, the US computer manufacturer, warned yesterday it expected
relatively flat growth in its North American personal computer shipments
during the second half, after achieving 40 per cent growth in the first six
months of the year.
Its shares closed Dollars 4 1/8 down in New York at Dollars 53 1/4 .
Compaq said total sales of PCs in North America would reach 13.8m units, 15
per cent up on 1992. It attributed the slowdown in the second half to an
unusually high level of shipments in the comparable period of last year,
when the industry was embroiled in a price war.
The North American market accounts for more than 45 per cent of turnover,
which reached Dollars 4.09bn in 1992. Overseas markets, however, are
becoming more important.
Sales in the Asia-Pacific area are expected to grow this year by 185 per
cent.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: IBM chief names new executive
team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOU Gerstner, IBM chairman since April, yesterday announced the creation
of an 11-person executive committee to make the computer company's
businesses work more effectively together, and advise him on group strategy.
The new team, which seems to comprise Mr Gerstner's inner circle, is much
larger than the management committee of Mr John Akers, who resigned as
chairman this year because of IBM's poor results.
And in a memo to staff, Mr Gerstner underscored the fact that he was drawing
back from Mr Akers' plan to decentralise the business to the point where
units could be spun off as separate companies.
'I have reached the firm conclusion that decentralisation versus
centralisation is not our most important organisational dilemma,' he says.
'Rather, it is the working relationships across our operating units -
product unit to product unit, geographic unit to product unit, geographic
unit to geographic unit.'
The committee is meant to overcome this. Its members will focus mainly on
overall corporate results, rather than the performance of individual units.
Their pay will be based on company-wide results, rather than the performance
of their own operations.
The members include Mr James Cannavino, head of personal computers; Ms Ellen
Hancock, head of networking, who takes on additional responsibility for
programming; Mr Bob Lebant, group executive for North America; Mr Ned
Lautenbach, group executive for international operations; and Mr Pat Toole,
head of the storage, printer and chips business.
It also includes Mr John Thompson, head of mini-
computers, who now also takes on overall responsibility for the group's key
mainframe computer business. Analysts welcomed this move as likely to spur
more creative solutions to computing problems.
Mr Nick Donofrio remains in charge of mainframe operations.
The committee also includes Mr Paul Rizzo, vice-chairman, a former IBM
executive who came out of retirement early this year to help the company; Mr
Bernard Puckett, Mr Gerstner's strategy chief; Mr Jerry York, chief
financial officer; and Mr Gerry Czarnecki, head of human resources.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Transatlantic struggle of
derivatives titans - Tracy Corrigan on charges of vested interest against
Chicago's trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deadlocked discussions between Liffe, the London-based futures exchange,
and Globex, the 24-hour electronic trading system, drew a volley of
criticism over the structure of Globex from European exchange chiefs at last
week's annual industry gathering in Burgenstock, Switzerland.
Globex was developed by Reuters, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, but is run as a joint venture between the two Chicago
exchanges. Concerned European exchange officials said that the vested
interests of the Chicago exchanges were proving an obstacle to other
exchanges joining the system.
Since the launch of Globex last year, only one other exchange, France's
Matif, has listed its products on the system. The Matif transferred its
existing after-hours telephone trading to Globex, and now contributes around
80 per cent of the system's volume. This gives the Matif a stronger voice in
Globex affairs.
But other exchanges are concerned that membership of Globex would give
control of their products to their rivals. 'We would be a lot happier if we
thought we would have direct control,' said one exchange head.
The balance of power in the futures markets has shifted since Globex was
conceived in 1987, when the two Chicago exchanges dominated trading.
Several officials pointed out that other Reuters trading systems are
controlled solely by Reuters, which contributed the bulk of Globex's Dollars
80m development costs.
Despite an invitation to resume talks last week from CBOT chairman Mr Pat
Arbor, there seems little immediate prospect of Liffe and Globex settling
their differences. Negotiations broke down last month when the CBOT said
that under the Globex contract it had exclusive rights to trade Bund futures
on the system, even though it has not yet listed the product.
Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, said that Liffe would only re-enter
negotiations if the listing of Liffe's bund contract on the system were
'back on the table unconditionally'. But Mr Arbor specified that the CBOT
would reconsider its position on the bund contract only if two other issues
were resolved first.
Reuters and the CME both wrote to the CBOT following the collapse of talks
last month, expressing concern over the CBOT's position. Reuters officials
declined to comment last week, except to express the company's long-term
commitment to Globex, saying that the negotiations are in the hands of the
joint venture company.
However, the split between the two Chicago exchanges over the negotiations
points to some deep-seated concerns about the future of the system.
'Reuters has a long-term view, but we (at the CBOT) are traders, we take a
short term view and we have to begin to see some return on our investment,'
Mr Arbor said in a recent interview. The slow start to trading on Globex and
the apparent reluctance of other exchanges to join the system could force a
re-examination of the company's structure.
The issue of exclusivity - that only one instrument based on one underlying
product can be listed - was described by the two Chicago exchanges last week
as central to the Globex philosophy and necessary to maximise the liquidity
of any contract on the system. But several non-US exchange officials said
that they did not see why rival contracts, which vie for volume every day in
the futures pits, could not similarly compete on Globex.
Flex options were first listed earlier this year by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as stated in Monday's
Risk and Reward Column.

RELIANCE Petroleum, part of the Reliance Industries group, is promoting
India's biggest equity issue, a Rs21.72bn (Dollars 691m) offering to be
launched on September 23.
The company will offer Rs8.61bn to the Indian public, Rs4.34bn to Indian
financial institutions, and Rs2.17bn to foreign institutional investors
registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund a Rs51.42bn 9m-tonne oil
refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat.
Indian mutual funds will be entitled to preferential allotments worth
Rs4.34bn.
Shareholders of Reliance Industries, excluding non-residents and global
deposit-holders, will be offered shares worth Rs2.17bn.
The plant will be India's first private-sector refinery, and will process
petroleum crude. The prospectus says that growth in demand for petroleum
products in India is expected to be between 5.2 and 6.5 per cent per year.
Additional refining capacity is being added to the existing public-sector
refineries, after a gap of 11 years. This will help save foreign exchange on
the importation of petroleum products.
The project, on India's western coast in Gujarat, is strategically located,
enabling crude carriers to make a round trip to and from Saudi Arabia in 12
days, should domestic supplies from the nearby Bombay High oilfields be
interrupted.
Reliance has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government-owned
Bharat Petroleum Corporation, one of the largest distributors of petroleum
products in India, for marketing its products.
The proposed Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline will run close to the refinery, making
transport of petroleum products economically viable and environmentally
safe.
Unilever is to merge two subsidiaries, Lipton and Brooke Bond India, writes
RC Murthy from Bombay. The deal will be carried out through a share swap of
nine Brooke bonds for 10 of Lipton.
Lipton India's turnover last year was nearly Rs7bn, with a profit before tax
of Rs340m. Brooke Bond recorded sales of Rs7. l4bn, with a profit before tax
of Rs640m.
The merger is part of Unilever's bid to integrate its food business in India
into a single company, the company said.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Flat year for Goodman Fielder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOODMAN Fielder, the Australian food group, yesterday reported an 8.4 per
cent increase to ADollars 117.2m (USDollars 77.1m) in profits after tax but
before abnormal items.
After abnormals, which made a large dent in 1991-92's profits, Goodman saw a
total profit of ADollars 182m, compared with ADollars 49.5m last year.
However, at the trading level, progress was more muted. Operating profit
advanced by 0.2 per cent to ADollars 245m on sales 1.8 per cent higher at
ADollars 3.98bn. A big jump for interest charges left pre-tax profits 1.4
per cent lower at ADollars 164.1m.
Most divisions showed an improvement. The fall in pre-tax profits was due to
a decline in profits from Australian baking and the timing of asset sales
and acquisitions, which the group claimed cost ADollars 9.4m.
GIO Australia, the insurance group, saw after-tax profits fall by 11.9 per
cent to ADollars 103.1m in the year ended June.

privatisations
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN institutional investors who want to increase their international
equity holdings are expected to focus more closely on the global offerings
of state-owned enterprises, according to a recent survey*, writes Antonia
Sharpe.
Around 40 per cent of the survey's 40 participants, who collectively manage
over Dollars 500bn in assets, said that prospects for investments in
privatised French companies were good.
Over 60 per cent of respondents felt that the investment outlook for France
was very positive.
Some 45 per cent said investment prospects were good in Italy, which is also
about to launch a privatisation programme.
However, they indicated that they would be reluctant to invest in Italy
without tangible evidence of its regulatory and economic reform.
While 75 per cent said their investment in privatisation issues over the
past few years had met or exceeded their expectations, they were
disappointed with the investor communication programmes of the companies
concerned.
Over 90 per cent of respondents said non-US companies would gain more
acceptance on Wall Street and suffer less flowback of stock if they
conducted active investor relations programmes.

SHOUGANG, the mainland Chinese steel group, will take control of its fourth

Eastern Century from 23 to 60 per cent.
Since October 1992, Shougang has taken over Tung Wing Steel, Kader

Paul Y-ITC.
Shougang Hong Kong bought 23 per cent of Eastern Century in February at
HKDollars 1.72 per share. Under the latest transaction, it is selling this
stake to its listed subsidiary, Shougang Concord International, at HKDollars
2.49.
A holding company 85 per cent-owned by SCI will acquire a further 37 per

details offer

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper group, fell 9
per cent yesterday. The drop followed the announcement that its major new
shareholder - Mr Robert Kuok - would not be launching an outright takeover
bid for the company.
The shares had been suspended from trading for six days pending the outcome
of negotiations between Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - which owned
50 per cent of SCMP - and Malaysian-born Mr Kuok. A USDollars 349m agreement
to sell 34.9 per cent of SCMP was signed in Hong Kong on Sunday.
However, the deal is contingent upon there being no requirement for Mr Kuok
to launch a general offer to all SCMP shareholders. Since the stake is below
the Hong Kong takeover code's 35 per cent trigger level, this should be a
formality.
Mr Kuok's Kerry Media revealed yesterday a further condition giving it the
right to purchase News Corp's remaining 15.1 per cent stake in SCMP at
HKDollars 5.17 a share, plus interest payments based on the value of the
investment, if a general offer is launched by the Kuok group within the next
18 months.
Mr Kuok is to be chairman of SCMP. His colleague, Mr Roberto Ongpin - the
former Philippines minister for trade and industry - will be deputy
chairman. Mr Kuok Khoon Ean and Mr Paul Bush are to become directors. Mr
Murdoch and Mr Gene Swinstead have resigned from the board.
Mr Kuok has no newspaper experience. However, the fact that News Corp
retains a 15.1 per cent stake in the company - short-term though this may be
 -means there should be relatively smooth transition in the management of
what has been one of the world's most consistently profitable newspapers.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Amcor expands with ADollars 415m
paper purchase
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMCOR, the Australian packaging and paper manufacturer, is buying the paper
manufacturing and distribution operations of North Broken Hill Peko, the
resources group, for ADollars 415m (USDollars 273m)
Amcor, which has faced tough import competition in the white papers market
recently, said the expansion of this business should help it to reduce costs
and become more competitive.
NBHP said the disposal was part of its strategy of concentrating on natural
resources. It will retain ownership of its forestry business, including the
wood chip export operations.
The businesses being sold comprise the pulp and paper manufacturing and
paper merchanting operations - including three mills at Burnie and Wesley
Vale in Tasmania and at Shoalhaven on the New South Wales coast - along with
three paper merchanting businesses.
Last year, the operations produced a profit before interest and tax of
ADollars 29m. No turnover figure was disclosed, but it is understood to have
been between ADollars 600m and ADollars 700m.
Amcor, which is funding the deal from internal resources and borrowings,
already has a significant interest in the white papers market through its
Australian Paper Manufacturers division and a 46 per cent interest in
Spicers Papers.
'Amcor is not earning a satisfactory return on its significant investment in
these industries,' admitted Mr Stan Wallis, managing director, yesterday.
The proposed acquisition, he suggested, would give Amcor 'broader
involvement in the marketplace - which is essential for a viable domestic
industry'.
Amcor has discussed the proposed deal with the Trade Practices Commission.
'At this stage, the Commission has indicated it is unlikely to oppose the
proposed acquisition,' said the company.
The Australian Council of Trade Unions said it welcomed the deal and hoped
it would end the lingering bitterness surrounding the Burnie mill in
Tasmania.
Burnie was the centre of a fierce battle, which led to strike action last
year, when NBHP attempted to change work practices. Amcor has pledged to
consult the ACTU.
Shares in Renison Goldfields rose sharply on speculation that NBHP, enriched
by the sale of its paper assets, might now launch a takeover bid. Renison
shares gained 22 cents to ADollars 3.42, while NBHP added 5 cents to
ADollars 2.93, and Amcor advanced 4 cents to ADollars 8.78.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Du Pont to cut a further 4,500
from US payroll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the largest US chemicals group, is cutting its workforce by a
further 4,500 as part of its efforts to shore up the sagging profitability
of its core chemicals operations.
The compulsory redundancies, all in the US, will be followed by an
unspecified number of job losses in Europe in a plan to save Dollars 500m a
year from operations there.
The job reductions announced yesterday are restricted to Du Pont's chemicals
and specialties businesses in the US, which currently employ 66,000. The
brunt of the cuts will be born by Du Pont Nylon, which will shed 1,600 of
its 11,000 staff and reduce its textiles capacity by 10 per cent.
The job cuts are part of a cost-reduction programme announced last year,
which is intended to produce savings of Dollars 2bn a year. An additional
1,300 jobs have already been shed under the plan, Du Pont said. Some 3,000
workers will receive redundancy notices by the end of this month, with the
remainder of the 4,500 staff going by mid-1994.
Du Pont will take a Dollars 375m after-tax charge in the third quarter to
reflect the cost of the redundancies. However, the company will record an
after-tax gain of Dollars 235m stemming from changes to the UK's petroleum
revenue tax regime.
Efforts to cut costs in Europe will take longer to implement, in part
because employment laws there will make it more difficult to shed staff, Du
Pont said. But Mr John Ogren, senior president in charge of human resources,
said: 'There will certainly be some sort of restructuring in Europe.'
Under a separate Dollars 1bn cost-reduction effort announced in 1991, Du
Pont has shed 9,000 support staff and between 2,000 and 3,000 contract
workers.

BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the largest US home video rental company,
strengthened its interests in Hollywood as the two production companies in
which it owned an interest agreed a merger.
The deal brings together Spelling Entertainment, of which Blockbuster
currently owns 63.5 per cent, and Republic Entertainment, of which it owns
37 per cent. Blockbuster is providing Dollars 100m to help finance
Spelling's takeover of Republic in a transaction that will leave it with
70.5 per cent of the combined entity.
Blockbuster owns the City-vision video rental company in the UK.
The deal brings together the former programme library of NBC, which was
acquired by Spelling, with that of ABC, owned by Republic.
The move to combine the businesses would strengthen its interest in film
production, said Blockbuster.
'We are the biggest single purchaser of Hollywood's products in the world.
This integrates us and gets us closer to the suppliers of those products.'
Under the terms of the agreement, Spelling will pay Dollars 13 in cash for
each Republic share. Options and warrants to buy Republic shares will be
acquired at the rate of 1.65 Spelling share for each Republic share. To
finance the deal, Blockbuster has agreed to buy 13.4m new Spelling shares
for Dollars 100m either in cash or Blockbuster shares.
Mr Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive of Republic, is to become
president and chief executive of Spelling.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Write-downs expected at Chemical
Waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Waste Management, the Illinois-based handler of hazardous waste, is
expected this month to announce a restructuring aimed at cutting costs and
writing down the values of its underperforming toxic waste incinerators.
WMX Technologies (formerly Waste Management), which has a 77 per cent stake
in Chemical Waste, earlier this year warned that declines in US
government-directed environmental clean-ups were trimming income at the unit
and would lead to lower-than-expected earnings in the second quarter.
In June, Chemical Waste reported second-quarter profits down to Dollars
22.6m, or 11 cents a share, from Dollars 52.4m, or 26 cents, a year earlier.
Analysts say the write-downs may total Dollars 200m, and that restructuring
and job losses could trim another Dollars 50m annually in operating
expenses. In July, Chemical Waste said it was studying its disposal
facilities, and the company this week declined further comment, other than
to confirm the review was continuing.
Analysts expect the writedowns to be recorded as charges to third-quarter
earnings, which will be reported in October.
Chemical Waste was a darling of Wall Street as recently as 1991, but is
suffering from shrinking demand for its services. The company's share price
has fallen from a high of around Dollars 26 in 1991 to a recent low of
Dollars 7 3/8 . In New York yesterday, the stock closed down Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 8 1/2 .
In June the company said its earnings had plummeted to Dollars 43.8m in the
first half, from Dollars 82.3m in the same 1992 period, and that during the
period its core businesses had barely broken even. The results dragged WMX's
earnings down by about 7 per cent. In August, Chemical Waste's directors
voted to suspend Chemical Waste's 20-cent per share dividend, citing
'uncertain market conditions'.
The reversal follows a fundamental change in corporate thinking about waste
generation. US companies, conscious of high off-site disposal costs and
environmental and legal liabilities, are sharply reducing their outputs of
hazardous waste - for example, through recycling and conservation.
At the same time, clean-ups mandated by the US government's Superfund
programme, designed to restore contaminated land, are far fewer than
projected, and the Environmental Protection Agency, some sources say, has
been slow in issuing expected new definitions of hazardous waste streams.
The giant incinerators built to burn toxic wastes have been hardest hit by
the trends. Chemical Waste said last week it had abandoned plans, begun in
1987, to build an incinerator in Kettleman Hills, California, where it
already operates a hazardous waste landfill.
The company also said that existing incinerator capacity was adequate to
meet the disposal needs of the western US. The US chemical company Du Pont
last month halted plans to build an Dollars 100m incinerator, and other
waste handling companies have reported declining volumes.
In California, which has a law that encourages companies to reduce
incinerable wastes, volumes fell 30 per cent between 1987 and 1990, and
continue to decline at a rate of about 10 per cent per year, Chemical Waste
says. Across the US, some of the biggest hazardous waste producers have
reported waste reductions of 50 per cent or more.
As a result, incinerator operators have had to slash prices to attract
volume, and margins for all companies have fallen. Chemical's operating
margins dropped to 4 per cent in the second quarter, from 25.3 per cent a
year ago.
Chemical Waste's core businesses are landfilling and incinerating hazardous
wastes, which are hauled to its own operations from corporate and municipal
sites. It also engages in 'special' clean-up projects, and through its
partially-owned subsidiary, Rust International, performs environmental
consulting.
Mr Vishnu Swarup, senior pollution control analyst for Prudential
Securities, believes Chemical Waste's asset writedowns will focus heavily on
its three incinerators. Its incinerator at Port Arthur, Texas,
underperformed in the first half, and its plant on the south side of Chicago
remains out of commission after an explosion two years ago.
In addition to the incinerators, Chemical Waste operates seven hazardous
waste landfills around the US and employs about 5,000 in North America.
Mr James McDonald, securities analyst with the Chicago Corporation, says
demand for Chemical's services is likely to remain weak until the
government's Superfund programme is reauthorised (legislation is expected in
1994) and hazardous waste standards are more clearly defined.

Caterpillar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER-TAX earnings at Caterpillar, the US construction equipment group, will
be boosted this year by Dollars 300m, or nearly Dollars 3 a share, following
the settlement of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, writes
Richard Waters.
Caterpillar said the money would be used to reduce outstanding debt, which
currently stands at over Dollars 4bn, including the retirement of some
relatively high-cost long-term debt. The costs associated with retiring
long-term debt would result in a pre-tax charge of Dollars 50m, Caterpillar
said.
The tax settlement relates to export sales made by the company in the period
1979-87. Last year, Caterpillar recorded a loss of just over Dollars 2 a
share before the effect of accounting changes. In New York, caterpillar's
share price closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 80 1/4 .

<TEXT>
MR Clifford Frame, chairman of Curragh, a big Canadian lead/zinc producer,
is making another attempt to raise new equity in Europe, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Curragh, which has been in bankruptcy protection since last April and has
closed its mines in the Yukon and British Columbia because of low metal
prices, faces a showdown with the Bank of Nova Scotia and its unsecured
creditors next Monday.
Mr Frame needs CDollars 50m (USDollars 38m) in new equity, and a CDollars
34m loan guarantee from the Yukon government, to save his restructuring
plan.
Last Friday, an Ontario court gave the bank the right to appoint a receiver
for two Curragh undeveloped properties. Creditors are owed more than
CDollars 200m and the company says it has run out of cash.
Two weeks ago, Korea Zinc and Samsung dropped a plan to buy 50 per cent of
Curragh for CDollars 50m.
Falling metal prices were a factor, but the Koreans wanted other big
investors to put up CDollars 25m.

BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the largest US home video rental company,
strengthened its interests in Hollywood as the two production companies in
which it owned an interest agreed a merger.

37 per cent. Blockbuster is providing Dollars 100m to help finance
Spelling's takeover of Republic in a transaction that will leave it with
70.5 per cent of the combined entity.
Blockbuster, which owns the Cityvision video rental company in the UK, said
the reshuffle did not signal any plan to expand into becoming a significant
film producer.
'We have no intention of changing the risk profile of the group. We are not
interested in making big feature-length films,' it said.
Blockbuster added that the move to combine the businesses would strengthen
its interest in film production and give it greater control over the film
and programme libraries of the two companies. 'We are the biggest single
purchaser of Hollywood's products in the world. This integrates us and gets
us closer to the suppliers of those products,' it said.
The deal brings together the former programme library of NBC, which was
acquired by Spelling, with that of ABC, owned by Republic.
The programmes and films in the Republic library include many old John Wayne
titles and the Bonanza television series.
Under the terms of the agreement, Spelling will pay Dollars 13 in cash for

acquired at the rate of 1.65 Spelling share for each Republic share. To

for Dollars 100m either in cash or Blockbuster shares.
Mr Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive of Republic, is to become

Blockbuster bought 48 per cent of Spelling from American Financial in March,
and at the same time took its holding above 50 per cent with smaller market
purchases.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mellon sues Primerica over
'broken promises'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MELLON Bank is suing Mr Sandy Weill's Primerica financial services group
over what it claims are broken promises concerning its administration of
some Dollars 50bn of former Shearson mutual fund assets.
Mellon took on the administration of Shearson's mutual funds in September
1992 when it bought The Boston Company, a trust and administration company,
from American Express, then the parent of Shearson Lehman.
The Shearson administration business accounted for around Dollars 100m of
Boston's annual revenues, Mellon said.
In its legal actions, filed in the district court for Western Pennsylvania,
the Pittsburgh-based bank claims that the merger of Shearson with
Primerica's Smith Barney has threatened its role as administrator to the
Shearson mutual funds.
Mellon also said that the purchase of Boston had contained a provision for
it to continue to administer the funds, and that Primerica had later
expressly endorsed this arrangement.
Also named in the action are Smith Barney, Lehman Brothers and American
Express.
Mellon said that, among other things, Smith Barney 'has created new mutual
funds that are virtual clones of existing Shearson funds serviced by The
Boston Company; has initiated mergers of Shearson funds into Smith Barney
funds that are not serviced by The Boston Company; and has otherwise
attempted or threatened to attempt to siphon off assets from the Shearson
funds'.
Mellon said that it had not quantified the size of its claim, and that the
legal actions were in part intended to prevent Smith Barney Shearson from
taking further steps which would damage its interests.
In response, Smith Barney said: 'We are surprised by the lawsuit. It is
factually incorrect. We believe it is without merit.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trizec prepares for asset
revaluations
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIZEC, North America's biggest quoted property developer, is preparing to
write down the value of some assets in tandem with a financial restructuring
being negotiated with debt and equity holders.
The Calgary-based company said that it was in the throes of a 'comprehensive
revaluation' of assets and liabilities, which would be reflected in
financial statements for its fiscal year to October 31.
The revisions will include adjustments to the carrying value of the
Bay-Adelaide Centre, a half-completed, 57-storey project in Toronto on which
work has been halted.
The continuing North American property slump widened Trizec's losses to
CDollars 17.7m (USDollars 13.5m), or 10.9 cents a share, in the third
quarter to July 31, from CDollars 1.6m, or 0.5 cents, a year earlier. Losses
for the first nine months were CDollars 12.7m, or 14.3 cents, compared with
a gain of CDollars 10.4m, or 6.5 cents.
Nine-month rental revenues rose by 3.5 per cent, but the improvement was due
to the contribution of new properties and favourable exchange-rate
movements.
The company said that net rents from its office properties had been cut by
the more generous inducements needed to maintain high occupancy rates.
It described the shopping-mall market as 'difficult', with downward pressure
on rents and increased demand for higher inducements from prospective new
tenants.
Trizec said it aimed to hold a vote among holders of CDollars 1.1bn of
senior debentures on its restructuring proposals before October 20.

business units work in a responsive way to serve customers and minimise
bureaucracy.
'I have reached the firm conclusion that decentralisation versus
centralisation is not our most important organisational dilemma,' Mr
Gerstner wrote.
The new committee will consist of Mr Jim Cannavino, Mr Gerry Czarnecki, Ms
Ellen Hancock, Mr Bob LaBant, Mr Ned Lautenbach, Mr Bernard Puckett, Mr Paul
Rizzo, Mr John Thompson, Mr Pat Toole, and Mr Jerry York.
Each will be part of the IBM corporate office and their principal focus will

Mr Gerstner added that IBM would rename some units to make the names
understandable and transparent to customers.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Metallbank breaks German mould -
David Waller on a Frankfurt-based investment banking boutique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GERMANY, a country where hopping from one profession to another is
frowned upon, a bank run by a former journalist still counts as highly
unusual.
But Mr Michael Gotthelf's background as financial editor of the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung is not the only unusual aspect of the Metallbank, where
Gotthelf is joint managing director.
The Frankfurt-based Metallbank, with 180 staff and a DM1.1bn (Dollars 688m)
balance sheet, has become something of a mould-breaker in the German
financial markets.
It organised the first German issue of so-called 'stripped' bonds, for the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau in May of last year, whereby the interest
payments on the DM300m issue were packaged into a separate issue. The
separate tradeability of the coupon was new for Germany and Metallbank acted
as lead manager and sole placing agent.
More recently, in January this year, the bank co-ordinated another first for
Germany, acting as main placing agent for a warrant issue on 30-year French
government bonds, working in conjunction with Caisse des Depots.
It worked with Citibank's Spanish operations to develop a similar warrants
issue on peseta bonds. Both issues were strong performers amid the currency
market turbulence of the past year.
It is also working with the Deutsche Bank to set up a service to allow
German companies to take out hedge and swap agreements on oil and fuel
prices.
As Mr Gotthelf admits, these products are commonplace in the US market - but
they are new for Germany.
The bank was founded in 1906 and developed into a savings and loans
institution for the staff of Metallgesellschaft, the large metals, mining
and industrial group based in the heart of Frankfurt.
The bank changed its complexion with the arrival of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch
at the helm of the parent company in the late eighties. Mr Schimmelbusch
helped turn the bank into what in the Anglo-American world would be
described as an investment banking boutique.
Metallbank is still owned by Metallgesellschaft - and it still provides
savings bank services for the parent company's employees - but two-thirds of
the bank's profits now come from its investment banking activities, an area
which employs just a third of the its staff.
Business activities include trading, fund management and mergers and
acquisitions advice - often to the parent company, which has until recently
been one of Germany's most vigorous buyers and sellers of businesses.
'We are backed by the capital of our mother company,' says Gotthelf, 'which
gives us a power in terms of trading muscle and information flow which no
other bank of this size can match. This has allowed us to duplicate US
inventions for the German market sometimes years before the big German banks
catch on.'
However, the association with the mother company is not uniformly positive.
Metallgesellschaft's profits have tumbled over the past two years amid deep
recession in the metals and engineering industries.
In June this year, the company reported half-year profits down 39 per cent
to DM98.3m. Its deal-making ambitions have been put into reverse:
Schimmelbusch is busily trying to raise DM1bn from corporate disposals.
Mr Gotthelf will not comment on this but the difficulties of the parent seem
to be one factor behind an (undisclosed) drop in the bank's profits last
year.
Moreover, the bank seems unlikely to escape the staff cuts planned for the
Metallgesellschaft group as a whole: the group's staff is to be lopped by 10
per cent over the next two years and the bank's headcount is set to drop by
the same proportion.
But, said Mr Lothar Mark, joint managing director, there will be no
redundancies - retirees in the non-investment banking part of the business
will simply not be replaced.
He added that profits are likely to rise by 30 per cent in the year to the
end of September, reflecting the bank's new issue business and vigorous
trading activity.
'We will be able to pay a handsome dividend to the mother company,' he
boasted. Few of the chiefs of Metallgesellschaft's other subsidiaries are
able to say the same.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Foster's moves back into the
black at six months

FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian brewing group with substantial operations
in the UK and Canada, yesterday returned to the black with a ADollars 310m
(USDollars 201m) profit after tax and abnormal items for the year ended
June.
The figure compares with a ADollars 950.8m loss in the previous year, a
result that was largely due to asset write-offs and other one-off charges.
At the operating profit level, before both tax and abnormal items, Foster's
reported a profit of ADollars 279.5m for the year just ended, up by 5.7 per
cent on last time's ADollars 264.4m.
Nevertheless, Foster's - which saw a management shake-up earlier this year
and in which Broken Hill Proprietary acquired a sizeable minority stake last
year - said that it was pleased with the results 'in the light of subdued
economic conditions and continuing declines in beer industry volumes in
Australia, the UK and Canada'.
Profit from the core brewing operations actually fell over the year, by
about ADollars 28m to ADollars 527m. Carlton and United Breweries posted an
11 per cent increase in operating earnings at ADollars 211m, with gains in
both volume and market share.
However, the Courage interests in the UK saw operating earnings fall to
ADollars 208 from ADollars 244m - although the fall was largely explained by
a resumption of contributions to the Courage Pension Funds, absorbing
ADollars 35m. Inntrepreneur Estates was described as 'trading
satisfactorily' with reduced losses.
Meanwhile, the profit contribution from Canada's Molson Breweries declined
to ADollars 107m from ADollars 120m - although Foster's blamed much of the
shortfall on the one-time cost of retaliatory duties on products exported to
the US and a reduced contribution in the final three months following the
sale of a 10 per cent interest in Molson to Philip Morris's Miller Brewing
division.
Interest expense was significantly reduced to ADollars 206m, compared with
ADollars 249.7m last time, due to the equity raising last year and a spate
of non-core asset sales.
Foster's said that these produced cash inflows of ADollars 648m, ahead of
budget, and that the disposal programme would continue for the next two to
four years.
The bottom-line profits figure was also aided by a ADollars 46m surplus on
abnormal items, stemming mainly from the profit on the sale of the Molson
shares.
Looking ahead, Foster's said it was not anticipating any significant
short-term improvement in beer industry volumes in the group's main markets
but it would continue to focus on non-core asset sales, debt reduction and
pushing down costs.

BEKAERT, the Belgian producer of steel wire and cord, beat worsening
economic conditions in the EC to increase net consolidated profits by 15 per
cent in the first half of 1993, to BFr951m (Dollars 27.7m) from BFr828m.
However, the group predicted that markets in the EC and North America would
weaken still further in the second half of the year. It expects to achieve a
full-year profit on current operations similar to the 1992 figure of
BFr1.66bn.
Since 1990, when Bekaert's profits collapsed and cash flow halved, the group
has undergone drastic restructuring. In the first half, cost savings and
efficiency improvements helped the group enhance profits in spite of price
reductions.
Turnover fell from BFr28.7bn to BFr27.8bn but the group said it had
'substantially increased its competitiveness'.
Sales volume rose in the first half by 9.7 per cent, or by 4 per cent if a
recent acquisition in Mexico is excluded.
Volume in Europe declined, but only slightly, the group said. The volume of
wire sold in the first six months dropped by only 1 per cent, for example,
compared with the first half of 1992.
The group blamed depressed investment levels and reduced consumption in
western Europe for a slump in demand.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Huntsman almost doubles its size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER round of the petrochemicals industry's musical chairs came to an end
yesterday with some companies leaving the game, and others confirming their
intention to reinforce their interests.
Texaco, the US oil company, virtually ended its participation in the
chemicals industry. Huntsman group, the Salt Lake City-based company, nearly
doubled its size through two separate deals, and vastly extended its
European operations.
Consolidated Press Holdings, the Australian group controlled by the media
mogul, Mr Kerry Packer, confirmed its continuing interest in the chemicals
sector. Elf Atochem of France sold its expandable polystyrene business to
Huntsman, but acquired Enichem's low density polyethylene activities.
For Texaco, the sale of almost all its chemicals operations follows a steady
decline in profitability for this at best marginal chemicals subsidiary.
Texaco Chemical's earnings fell from Dollars 268m in 1989 to only Dollars 7m
in 1991, and last year the business made a loss of Dollars 49m on a turnover
of Dollars 1.4bn.
The Texaco subsidiary has been shedding operations and cutting costs for the
past few years, but the group faced a massive capital expenditure bill of
about Dollars 400m for its massive propylene oxide/MTBE plant at Port
Neches, Texas. The new Huntsman-Packer joint venture, Huntsman Corporation,
has an option to buy half or all of the plant which is due to come on stream
at the end of 1994.
Huntsman group said the acquisition extended the range of products available
to the company, including fuel and lubricant additives, textile chemicals,
agricultural, solvents and surfactant products.
Elf Atochem's sale of its expandable polystyrene business to Huntsman
Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of Huntsman group, allows it to quit a
business in which it was only a marginal competitor. With capacity of only
50,000 tonnes a year, it was in a poor position to take on the likes of
Shell (175,000 tonnes a year) or BASF of Germany (195,000 tonnes a year).
Instead, the French company has enlarged its polyethylene activities by
acquiring Enichem's low density polyethylene plant. The operation is at the
same site - Carling Saint-Avold - as both Elf Atochem's ethylene cracker,
which provides raw materials for polyethylene, and its plastic derivatives
business.
For EniChem, the chronically loss-making Italian state chemicals group, the
sale should further its drive to cut costs and improve earnings.

<TEXT>
RENAULT and Volvo yesterday announced the formation of a five-member
management board which will determine the structure of their merged
automotive operations and manage the new company when it is officially
launched at the beginning of next year.
The French and Swedish motor vehicle companies said the team was announced
just one week after the conclusion of their merger agreement in order to
'secure a speedy and efficient transition'.
As stated in the terms of the merger agreement, which will create the
world's sixth largest automotive group, the management board will comprise
two representatives from Renault, two from Volvo and will be chaired by Mr
Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman.
The management board will have overall management responsibility for the
running of Renault-Volvo Automotive. There will also be an 18-member
supervisory board, headed by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman. The
supervisory board will appoint the management board and will decide on
significant financial issues concerning the merged group.
The management representatives from Renault, Mr Patrick Faure and Mr
Philippe Gras, are both executive vice-presidents of the French car company.
Mr Faure is the head of Renault's worldwide marketing and sales and has been
president of Renault Sport since 1986. Mr Gras, the former head of Renault
Vehicules Industriel, the trucks and buses operations of the group, is
principally involved in product development.
From Volvo, the two members of the management board are Mr Lennart Jeannson
and Mr Karl-Earling Trogen. Mr Jeannson is president and chief executive
officer of Volvo Car Corporation and executive vice-president of AB Volvo,
the group's parent company. Mr Trogen is head of Volvo's truck operations in
the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Nordic groups plan to merge their cement activities to create a new
regional force in the building materials sector in the face of the collapse
in construction activity.
Sweden's Euroc is buying Partek Cement and Lohja from the Finnish companies
Partek and Metra. In return the two Finnish groups will receive 11.8m new
shares in Euroc worth SKr1.2bn (Dollars 153m). This gives them a 25 per cent
holding in Euroc, equal to the stake held by Skanska, Sweden's leading
construction and property group.
Mr Finn Johnsson, Euroc president said: 'Each one of our companies is too
small to create the resources needed for necessary investments in plants,
new technology, research, environmental measures and product development.
Taken together we have overcapacity of around 50 per cent, against 25 to 30
per cent in the rest of Europe.'
He said that there would be substantial rationalisation as a result of the
merger, including the possible closure of a cement plant in Sweden and
another in Finland. Mr Johnsson said the target was to cut costs by SKr200m
a year from 1996.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Promoting retailing to new frontiers -
Maggie Urry considers the background to the proposed flotation of Allders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLDERS, the department store and duty free retailer, is likely to have a
market value of Pounds 150m when it floats on the stock market this autumn.
The group is expected to raise between Pounds 75m and Pounds 95m in new
money, which will largely repay its debts of about Pounds 90m, net of cash.
Mr Harvey Lipsith, the chief executive, said the objective was to secure a
more stable and sustainable financial structure and pave the way for future
growth.
He said Allders was not being pushed to float by investors keen to sell. The
timing was decided by a combination of factors, such as a significantly
improved trading performance in 1993, against 1992, the group's view of the
trading outlook and the current level of the stock market.
The float, announced yesterday, is expected to be timed after Allders'
financial year end of September 30, so that an estimate of 1993 profits will
be included in the prospectus. Schroders is sponsoring the issue.
Analysts at James Capel, the stockbroker handling the float, are forecasting
an operating profit of Pounds 21.5m for the year, before one-off charges,
which compares with Pounds 9.8m in 1992, when profits were hit by Pounds
3.7m of store opening costs.
Allders has been planning to float ever since it was formed by a leveraged
buy-out from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, in 1989. Hanson had
bought the business as part of its acquisition of UDS, the retail group, in
1983.
Mr Lipsith, already at Hanson when Allders was acquired, led the buy-out and
shortly afterwards recruited Mr Tony Collyer, the finance director from
Arthur Andersen, the accountants.
Four years of recession since the buy-out delayed the float, although it is
still within the three-to-five year timetable originally envisaged.
The expected flotation value of Pounds 150m can be set against a price of
Pounds 224m paid to Hanson. But the figures are not comparable, and original
equity investors are expected to see a reasonable return on their money.
Hanson has a 5 per cent stake.
Part of the finance for the buy-out came from a Pounds 40m loan from Hanson,
which was due to roll-up into a Pounds 80m repayment in 1994. Tough trading
conditions and looming debt repayments led to a refinancing in 1991.
That allowed Allders to buy back the Hanson debt for Pounds 5m, delay
repayments on other loans, and extract a further Pounds 10m of equity
capital from investors who had originally put up Pounds 50m. More than
Pounds 30m of bank debt has been repaid, and Pounds 50m invested in the
business.
Recession may have affected trading and necessitated a refinancing, but it
has not stopped Allders from developing the group.
The department store and duty free sides of the business are run as distinct
activities. They each contribute roughly half of turnover, and at the bottom
line, the profit contribution is also about the same.
The department store operation is the fourth largest in the UK, but it is in
a fragmented market. Two department stores were opened in 1992, taking the
total to 12, but no further new stores are planned as the recession has
finally brought to an end the surge of shopping mall developments which
generally include a department store.
However, Mr Lipsith is prepared to acquire some of the 200 or so small
independent department store companies.
Allders has also opened six out-of-town stores under the name At Home With
Allders, offering the household ranges, in the last two years. Despite the
recession, these stores have performed well and more will be developed.
Allders' bias towards the south east of England, and its heavier dependence
on household goods than fashion, were bad news in the recession. Investment
in systems over recent years has improved productivity and efficiency.
Mr Lipsith scorns the notion that 'department stores are the dinosaurs of
retailing'. He believes that Allders has greater scope to bounce back than
other department stores.
If department stores are the stable part of the business, duty free has been
more volatile.
Allders is the second largest duty free retailer in the world, after Duty
Free Shoppers, a US company which largely trades in the Pacific region. It
has 128 outlets, including shops on the QE2 liner, and airports from
Melbourne to San Francisco to London. These shops are usually run under
short-term contracts regularly put up for retendering. They are dependent on
the number of air travellers, which can be suddenly depressed at times such
as the Gulf War. However, air travel is forecast to grow rapidly in the
longer term.
Allders' 1992 profits were depressed by the loss of one large contract, the
shop at Sydney airport where it was outbid when the contract came up for
renewal after 12 years. Allders claims a generally good track record in
winning renewals.
A recent deal with BAA, which operates seven airports, including Heathrow
and Gatwick, should bring greater certainty to the duty free profits.
Allders' shops in BAA airports represent about half its duty free turnover
and the agreement will give it security of tenure until 1999 while changing
the method of payment to reduce Allders' risk, and increase its incentive to
drive profits higher. It is also negotiating a 25 year lease on its
important Toronto airport shops.
With the duty free business becoming less volatile, and prospects for
recovery in the department stores, Allders can expect a warm reception when
it comes to market.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dewhirst advances to Pounds 3.51m at midway
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEWHIRST Group, one of Marks and Spencer's main clothing suppliers,
yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds
3.51m in the six months to July 16.
'There are clear signs of increased activity on the high street. Operating
costs are under tight control and the board expects progress to continue for
the rest of the year,' Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman since February, said.
Sales rose to Pounds 95.4m (Pounds 81.3m). 'Ladies wear continued to perform
very well during the six months,' said Mr Dewhirst. 'In Mens wear, the
volume increases which started to come through in the autumn have continued.
Childrens wear remains a difficult area, with sales static and margins under
pressure.'
Higher demand, stimulated by Marks and Spencer's 'outstanding value'
campaign, had lifted productivity. Prices of three-quarters of the high
street retailer's clothing lines were held, and the remaining quarter was
cut, in the campaign which was launched last autumn.
'The campaign has been a great success for Marks and Spencer and for us, and
it has helped us to produce these results,' said Mr Dewhirst. 'It's meant
that we have seen volume increases in orders which has allowed us to plan
the business more effectively and boost productivity.'
But he warned: 'The campaign is not just about holding prices and reducing
prices. We still need to see the newness and innovation of product coming
through. It's got to be updated all the time.'
He added that the company was focusing efforts on improving operating
margins, which were up at 3.76 per cent (3.31 per cent).
Net interest charges fell to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 365,000) helped by lower
rates. Net cash at the period end was Pounds 3.25m, compared with a net
overdraft of Pounds 3m a year earlier. The interim dividend rose to 0.4p
(0.32p), payable from earnings per share of 1.87p (1.28p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Bio losses deepen to Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Bio-technology Group showed pre-tax losses up from Pounds 2.9m to
Pounds 4.2m in the three months to July 31.
Mr Brian Richards, chairman, said that the loss - which led to a net cash
outflow of Pounds 4.8m - was 'well within budget'.
It was due mainly to greater spending on research and development.
In July the company sold British Bio-technology Products, its research
reagents business which had a first-quarter turnover of Pounds 1.7m, to
concentrate on the 'core pharmaceutical business'. This had a turnover of
only Pounds 467,000, since British Bio-technology's drugs are still in the
R&amp;D phase and not yet on the market.
The company said clinical trials of its first three products - BB-94 for
cancer, p24-VLP for Aids, and BB-882 for pancreatitis and sepsis - are going
well, with more than 200 patients now taking part.
BB-t expects to start clinical development of three more drugs within the
next year. One is Stem Cell Protector to reduce the bone marrow toxicity of
chemotherapy. The other two are aimed at treating cachexia (a wasting
condition associated with advanced cancer) and acute heart disease.

INTERIM pre-tax profits at Nestor-BNA rose from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2m,
flattered by costs booked in the first half of last year relating to a
near-20 per cent stake in a UK weight-loss joint venture.
Nutri/System UK was closed after the company's US partner suffered adverse

Total operating profits were static at Pounds 2.74m for the 24 weeks to June
18 on turnover up at Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 44.7m).
Mr Michael Rogers, chairman, said: 'Our UK healthcare businesses are
responding well to the changes in their markets.'
However, he said the outlook for its large US health care business was
'difficult to predict' because of uncertainty over reforms.
In the UK, new legislation 'has given us opportunities to supply nurses and
carers to the frail elderly in their own homes. From a standing start this
now accounts for 4 per cent of our UK nursing agency business,' Mr Rogers
said.
In the nursing homes and hospitals division the company has been doing an
increasing amount of work under contract to local authorities and health
authorities.
The acquisition in March of BUPA Nursing Services helped lift revenue in the
UK nursing agencies division to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 20.6m) and operating
profits to Pounds 862,000 (Pounds 571,000).
Mr Clive Chapman, finance director, said it was impossible to gauge the
contribution of the acquisition for Pounds 400,000 cash and the assumption
of Pounds 1.8m in debt.
The acquisition was paying its own interest charges, he added.
Net borrowings rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 13.2m), leaving the company with
gearing of 334 per cent (116 per cent) at the half way stage.
Shareholders funds fell to Pounds 5.3m compared with Pounds 7.4m at the
start of the year, following the write-off of goodwill on BNSL.
A maintained 1.15p interim dividend is being paid out of earnings per share
up at 1.93p (0.88p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Forth Ports shares jump despite warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Forth Ports jumped to a high of 365p yesterday, shrugging off the
Scottish port operator's warning on second half trading to focus on better
than expected interim operating profits of Pounds 5.66m against Pounds 5.05m
last year.
The shares, which were floated on the stock exchange at 110p in March last
year, fell back by the end of the day to close 23p higher at 357p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 fell by Pounds 980,000 to
Pounds 5.49m, reflecting the loss of interest gains following the early
repayment of government loans. Earnings per share fell from 15.4p to 11.9p,
largely due to the repayment.
Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 17.1m, while overall tonnage
increased by more than 4 per cent to 11.4m tonnes.
Mr Hugh Thompson, Forth's chief executive, warned that the second half would
not be as good as the first. In spite of overall increases in tonnage for
products including animal feeds, cement and timber the markets served by
some of Forth's main customers - most particularly British Pipe Coaters,
which serves the North Sea oil sector - remained depressed.
However, he was more optimistic about 1994, citing the new BP terminal.
Tonnage handled by the new terminal and the existing one would be more than
three times the volume expected this year.
This bullish outlook left the group sufficiently confident to increase its
dividend by 13 per cent to 2.25p.
The group's property joint venture had concluded the Pounds 47.5m sale of
land and development to the government for the new Scottish Office. Mr
Thompson said the payments would be made in stages until 1995.
Mr Thompson said Forth had 'not wasted any money' in preliminary
investigations into the acquisition of Medway Ports, which is now in
takeover discussions with Mersey Docks Harbour Company. Forth was now
interested in pursuing purchases of soon-to-be-privatised ports on the east
coast of England.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Second Alliance net assets up 28%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Second Alliance Trust turned in a 28 per cent increase in net asset
value for the year ended July 31, up from Pounds 12.79p to Pounds 16.4p.
The improvement largely occurred in the earlier part of the financial year
and was triggered by the effect of the withdrawal of sterling from the ERM
on the trust's overseas portfolio.
Net revenue improved to Pounds 7.66m (Pounds 7.17m) and earnings per share
came out at 39.74p (37.22p). A final dividend of 26.5p (24.5p) makes a total
for the year of 39p (36.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTATES &amp; General, the property investor and developer, reported a fall in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 1.53m in the six months to June
30. The comparable figure was after an exceptional provision of Pounds 7.4m.
The company also announced it would shortly be entering negotiations for an
extension to its banking facilities. In April it reached agreement for
continuing support to December 31.
It is also continuing discussions with the Co-operative Bank, as the sole
holder of Pounds 3.25m of unquoted cumulative convertible redeemable
preference shares, concerning their maturity which became due on June 30.
Earlier in the year holders of the 11 per cent unsecured loan notes agreed
to revised redemption terms and last week holders of the Pounds 21m first
mortgage debenture stock accepted a relaxation of the capital covenant
requirements.
Turnover increased to Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 4.41m) including property
development income of Pounds 891,000 (Pounds 182,000). Losses per share were
cut from 53.06p to 7.16p.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Raw material costs limit growth at British
Polythene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAW MATERIAL increases adversely affected British Polythene Industries, the
acquisitive polythene film products maker, which reported slightly increased
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.53m to Pounds 6.61m in the half year to
June 30.
Operating profits slipped from from Pounds 7.81m to Pounds 7.77m on
increased sales of Pounds 96.6m (Pounds 85.1m).
The group has bought three businesses since it raised Pounds 20.6m earlier
this year in a rights issue, taking total acquisitions to 11 since its
Pounds 15.5m rights issue in 1991.
However, Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, expects the
company's rate of acquisitions to slow down.
'Target companies are attracting higher prices than we believe are
justified. We are not willing to pay the prices that people seem to be
paying and will therefore wait until the market is more favourable.'
Mr McLatchie said the three businesses purchased since March were operating
profitably. The company is not planning to manufacture retail bags in a
joint venture in China until next year.
Borrowings rose to Pounds 14m (Pounds 12.5m), mainly because of
acquisitions, representing gearing of 18 per cent. Lower interest rates saw
a decline in net interest payable to Pounds 698,000 (Pounds 771,000).
Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 12.29p (13.27p). The interim
dividend is increased to 3.75p (3.5p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Etonbrook bid terms revised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VALID acceptances to the bid for Etonbrook Properties from Panther
Securities and Multitrust have been received in respect of 1.93m ordinary
shares. That represents 39.52 per cent of the voting rights and 50.46 per
cent of issued capital.
Under City code rules the offer cannot become unconditional until the offer
has been received in respect of more than 50 per cent of the voting rights.
The bidding companies, in which Mr Alex Perloff, a rebel shareholder in
Etonbrook, has interests, considered it unlikely given the level of
acceptance to date that the offer would become unconditional.
They said that in this event the offer would lapse and acceptors to the
offer would remain shareholders in Etonbrook.
The bidders were conscious that this may not be the result acceptors would
want and were therefore revising certain terms allowing accepting
shareholders to withdraw their acceptances in order to sell their ordinary
shares in the market through Southard Gilbey McNish &amp; Co to realise a
guaranteed minimum net price of 79p per share.
To enable accepting shareholders to take this course of action the closing
date of the offer has been extended until September 24.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas signs 20-year contract in the
Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has expanded its international activities by signing a 20-year
contract to supply the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago from its
Dolphin field, off the east coast of the Caribbean islands.
Mr Howard Dalton, managing director for exploration and production, said
'the agreement gives the go-ahead for the development of the field,' which
with probable reserves of 2,000bn cu ft is twice as big as the North
Morecambe field off the west coast of the UK.
The company declined to put a value on the contract, which will require
British Gas and Texaco, its 50/50 partner, to invest Dollars 300m (Pounds
195m). An offshore drilling and production platform will be built as well as
a 42-mile subsea pipeline. The first gas is expected to flow in mid-1996.
British Gas took over the Dolphin field when it acquired much of Tenneco
International's international oil and gas operations in 1988. It is also
part of a consortium which is assessing the prospects of exporting liquefied
natural gas from other offshore fields in the area.
The company, which is also active in Argentina and Canada, reported sharply
higher profits from international gas supply in its interim figures last
Thursday.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pendragon shows 42% improvement to Pounds
3.07m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENDRAGON, the dealer in luxury and executive cars, yesterday reported a 42
per cent gain in interim profits, mainly reflecting higher margins.
Pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds 3.07m in the six months to June 30, from
Pounds 2.17m in the year-ago period, on sales which grew by 18.3 per cent to
Pounds 119.6m (Pounds 101.2m) including Pounds 1.24m from acquisitions.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 3.57m (Pounds 3.12m) and interest
payments fell to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 949,000).
Earnings per share came out at 6.1p, a 27 per cent rise on the 4.8p reported
in 1992, after adjusting for the effects of the group's recent Pounds 16.6m
rights issue. The interim dividend is being increased to 2.4p (2.2p).
Despite this, Pendragon's results were less sparkling than some had expected
and the stock closed 7p lower at 277p yesterday.
Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said that although the overall new car
market grew by 9 per cent in the first half, volume brands showed greater
gains than the more expensive brands which comprise the majority of
Pendragon's portfolio, and the registrations of some prestige marques,
including BMW, Mercedes Benz and Porsche, actually fell.
He said that although Pendragon's new car unit sales increased, profit
growth was due mainly to increased margins. New car sales generated Pounds
4.6m in gross profits compared with Pounds 3.8m in the 1992 period, despite
a small loss in the group's two dealerships in Frankfurt.
Used car margins were at a similar level to the previous year, but
profitability improved to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.6m) as a result of an
increase in volume.
Income from after sales operations increased again to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds
8.1m), mainly due to the contribution from recent acquisitions and
greenfield developments. However, the contract hire operations showed little
change over the year-ago period with their profit contribution unchanged at
Pounds 900,000.
The group intends to use the Pounds 7m balance of of the rights issue
proceeds to fund further expansion. In the meantime the funds have been
temporarily used to pay manufacturers for deposits on new stock, thereby
avoiding stocking loan interest but leaving the group with net borrowings of
Pounds 4.73m.
COMMENT
Pendragon is expected to continue the selective acquisition programme which
has transformed its franchise portfolio over the past three years. It now
has its first Rover franchise and wants to add both Ford and Vauxhall to the
list. The second half bias in results will be further emphasised this year
because the upturn in the luxury market has lagged the general improvement,
and because of other factors including the launch of Mercedes' new small car
next month. Overall however, full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7.25m
are likely, producing earnings of 13.5p and a prospective p/e of about 20.5.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: FII tumbles 19% to Pounds 5.2m - Shoe
maker's shares fall as sterling devaluation takes its toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of sterling dealt a heavy blow to FII, the UK shoe
manufacturer which yesterday reported a 19 per cent tumble in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 5.2m.
The shares responded via a 15p fall to 413p.
Mr Monty Sumray, chairman, said substantial cost increases of up to 20 per
cent were imposed 'almost overnight' as a result of the UK's withdrawal from
the exchange rate mechanism in September. FII buys 25 per cent of its raw
materials and components, such as leather uppers, from abroad.
The decline in buying power was exacerbated by demands from FII's customers
for price reductions to cope with lower demand. FII supplies some 50 per
cent of its footwear to Marks and Spencer. As a result, margins fell by 2.5
per cent in the second half alone.
Mr Sumray estimated the margin decline had cost the group some Pounds 1m.
Pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 were further depressed by the Pounds
350,000 costs of the group's unsuccessful bid for its fellow UK shoe
manufacturer C&amp;J Clark. FII was one of three contenders invited earlier this
year by the family-owned group to bid. Shareholders eventually rejected all
offers. Mr Sumray said the bid had been a 'waste of money, in a sense'.
On a brighter note, customers' reluctance to place orders in the face of
recession appeared to be disappearing. Turnover increased by Pounds 2m to
Pounds 82m in the year. Mr Sumray said the group's factories were operating
at full capacity, after a period of short-time working in the second half.
The chairman said FII was taking several steps to repair damage done to
margins last year. These included some job cuts, investment in more
efficient machinery, new shoe ranges and penetrating new markets - including
the US and Japan. Although these measures would not restore margins in the
short term, Mr Sumray was optimistic growth would be resumed next year.
FII exported some 8.5 per cent of its footwear sales, which rose overall by
3 per cent to Pounds 71m. Mr Sumray said the increase had been achieved in a
declining market where imports claimed some 71 per cent of sales. Operating
profits fell from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4.9m.
FII's scientific and technical division, manufacturing medical equipment,
had been steady, he said, with sales of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 11.6m).
Operating profits were static at Pounds 100,000.
Earnings per share fell from 30.8p to 22.7p. A final dividend of 8.75p
(8.5p) makes a 14.75p (14p) total.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Addicted to a miniature world - Ian
Hamilton Fazey peers at Lilliput Lane's marketing methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unusual bus load of American holidaymakers has toured Britain this month,
guided by an equally unusual travel courier.
The Americans were members of the Lilliput Lane Collectors' Club; their
courier was one of the artists who sculpts the miniature model houses they
collect.
Their quest for the original buildings and settings on which the models are
based was typical of the marketing strategy of the company.
Addiction is the key, says Mr John Russell, Lilliput Lane's chairman and
chief executive. People become charmed and hooked - and start collecting:
more than 10,000 people came to its Collectors' Club annual fair in North
Yorkshire.
Small but deliberate shortages of models, which range from Pounds 7.95 to
Pounds 450, feed the growing habit. Model retirements are announced six
months ahead of time, creating a final surge in demand. Second-hand prices
often rise after production ends. Only 66 models were made of Cliburn
School, for example. They now change hands among US collectors for up to
Dollars 8,000.
Cultivating collectors has helped bring the company from near-collapse three
years ago to a planned stock market flotation in November.
Mr David Tate, an artist and the company's technical director, had the
original idea for the models and worked out how to mass produce them with no
loss of intricate detail in the moulding process.
The company started near Penrith in Cumbria in 1982 making hand-painted
plaster miniatures of quaint cottages and other attractive buildings. It ran
into trouble, however, when it borrowed heavily in 1987 to diversify into
gnomes, dragons, and fine china art objects.
It was turned round by a new management team under Mr Russell which stripped
the company back to its original model business. Fresh finance came from
Lazard Ventures, which had funded the diversification, and North of England
Ventures.
Mr Russell, who had learned his management and marketing skills with Burton
in the 1970s and Courtaulds in 1980s, introduced better financial and
quality controls to achieve substantial productivity and profit
improvements.
The business is labour intensive, with hand-painting each model being a
critical cost. The 250 painters in the Penrith and Workington workshops can
now can earn incentive payments for completing models to quality standards
but ahead of target times.
Control of unit costs goes right back to the basic design, where new models
are sculpted in wax for moulding. They are designed with both painting time
and final price in mind: a vicarage now in the prototype stage, for example,
will take 7.5 minutes to paint and will retail for about Pounds 14. A Welsh
lodge will take 33.5 minutes and will cost nearly Pounds 50 in the shops.
With these and other disciplines in place, Lilliput Lane's sales have risen
from Pounds 12.1m in the year ended September 1990 to Pounds 13.6m in the
year ended January 1993.
The company has swung from a loss of Pounds 1.02m to a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 2m.
Mr Russell hopes to develop his 'collectibles' strategy in other markets
after flotation frees him from having 60 per cent of Lilliput Lane's shares
held by venture capitalists, although NEV will keep a 5 per cent holding.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Premier Consolidated Oilfields drops 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIER CONSOLIDATED Oilfields yesterday reported a 12 per cent fall in net
profits for the first half of 1993, from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.6m, with
last year's figure restated to allow for accounting policy changes.
But the UK independent exploration and production company predicted that
output would jump from 14,200 barrels a day at present to 20,000 b/d by
1996.
Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said a planned maintenance shutdown
last April at the Wytch Farm field in the UK and declining production at the
offshore Angus field accounted for much of the fall in net profits.
The shutdown caused average first half production to fall to 11,000 b/d,
which was reflected in lower turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 26.3m) and
operating profit of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 9.7m).
Earnings per share were 12 per cent down at 0.84p (0.95p).
The company said three areas - Wytch Farm, the Fife oil field in the North
Sea and the Qadirpur gas project in Pakistan - would help boost production
to a peak of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 1996. Mr Jamieson
said the first successful horizontal well at Wytch Farm extending under
Poole Bay would ensure that the company's higher production level would be
maintained this year, with Fife and Qadirpur coming fully on stream in
coming years.
Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was also well placed to carry on
with its 'aggressive exploration programme' despite current low oil prices.
But the option of 'purchasing reserves is still there,' according to Mr
Gerry Orbell, exploration director.
He said that although there would be no fall in Premier's overall
exploration spending, in the short-term the emphasis would be on lower-risk
exploitation and appraisal of existing discoveries. In the past five years
one in eight of Premier's wildcat wells drilled outside the UK had proved to
be commercial. The record in the UK was one in 10.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Beckenham warns on results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beckenham Group, the restructured USM-traded heating and ventilation
engineer, has announced a board shake-up and warns that the current year's
results will again be disappointing.
The company said that Mr Peter Long becomes executive chairman while Mr
Brian Newman (formerly managing director) and Mr Christopher Egleton
(formerly chairman) are leaving the board.
Beckenham Ductwork, the group's largest subsidiary, formed as a result of
last year's reorganisation, was still not performing satisfactorily. This
was partly due to difficult trading conditions but also certain aspects of
the reorganisation which are not producing the required benefits.
The directors said further changes were being made which should bring
significant cost savings. Turnover at this subsidiary fell below budget in
the third quarter and at the start of the fourth quarter but had now picked
up.
The situation has adversely affected profitability and put a strain on cash
resources. Certain shareholders are making available support of more than
Pounds 2m with the intention that most will be converted into long-term
capital.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Candover drops to Pounds 1.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST rates hit pre-tax profits at Candover Investments, the
investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, which yesterday
reported a 28 per cent decline to Pounds 1.63m for the six months to June
30.
The group reported a 5 per cent increase in its net assets per share,
however, to 281p. Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said the rise in net assets
reflected the strong performance of the companies in which Candover had
invested.
Mr Brooke was bullish about Candover's prospects in the medium term, saying
he had discerned positive signs of economic recovery. Although in the past,
most improvements in Candover's investments had been due to cost cutting and
productivity increases, there had been recent signs of an upturn in consumer
demand. 'It shows recovery is happening; not very fast and not universally,
but it is happening,' Mr Brooke said.
Candover was also expecting to realise investments in at least five of its
companies, he said - including Midland Independent Newspapers and Inspec -
which were planning public flotations in the near future.
As a result of these prospects, the interim dividend was increased by 5 per
cent to 3.95p (3.75p). Earnings per share fell from 6.81p to 4.87p.
Operating income fell from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.64m due to lower
interest gains and a reduction in financing fees. Only one major deal had
been done in the first half - the buy-out of catering company Gardner
Merchant - compared with several the previous year.
Mr Brooke said he expected the second half to remain largely similar to the
first. However, prospects for buy-outs of more than Pounds 100m appeared
more encouraging next year. 'We have seen a considerable uplift in the
number of deals that look interesting,' he said.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boots plans 240 new high street chemists
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS the Chemists yesterday gave a robust defence of its growth prospects,
saying it planned to open 240 new high street chemists stores by 1997, and
still saw scope for increasing profit margins.
Presenting the strategy Mr Gordon Hourston, managing director, attempted to
counter City fears that there was little room for further profits growth at
the chain, which contributed 67 per cent of group sales and 70 per cent of
pre-tax profits last year. Those fears have contributed to a significant
underperformance by the shares this year. They closed 8p down at 489p
yesterday.
Mr Hourston said that in five years, the chemists chain had increased
pre-tax profits from Pounds 151m to Pounds 285m and sales from Pounds 2.08bn
to Pounds 2.66bn. It had also increased its return on capital employed from
35.5 per cent to 64.4 per cent, about three times that of the biggest
grocery superstores.
'We see at least as much scope for shareholder value growth now as we did
five years ago,' Mr Hourston said.
He added that Boots had not been hurt by high-profile price-cutting
campaigns by its rival Superdrug on fragrances, condoms and sun-care
products.
He said that Boots, which followed Superdrug's move by slashing the prices
of 22 suncare products, had increased its market share from 45 per cent to
more than 50 per cent as a result.
He added that there was still considerable scope for increasing gross
margins.
Mr Ian Webster, director of planning, said that across 24 product areas, the
contribution per sq m of floor space varied widely, and by experimenting
with such factors as product mix and shelf-space allocation, the
contribution of under-performers could be improved. Some unprofitable
categories could be discontinued.
Boots is trialling different approaches to improving the performance of
unprofitable ranges across its 1,100 stores.
The chain is continuing to expand its own brand products, which make higher
gross margins, and of which 33 per cent are manufactured by the group.
It is stepping up its battle with Body Shop by launching a new 'global
collection' of toiletries and cosmetics made from natural ingredients.
Another prong of Boots' strategy is to expand its network of small chemists,
opening one store every 10 days for the next four years. Mr Ron Glaister,
director of stores, said the small stores made the biggest return on
capital, and the company had identified 240 target sites.
An experimental programme has also begun of opening outlets inside
Sainsbury's superstores. Boots said the seven outlets now operating differed
in their siting and product mix, but overall, their performance was above
expectations.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CentreGold to play the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTREGOLD, a leading UK publisher and distributor of video game and
computer entertainment software, is planning to come to market through a
placing with institutional investors.
The Birmingham-based group was founded by Mr Geoff Brown, a former teacher,
with Pounds 200 of capital 10 years ago.
Mr Brown expects to retain about a 30 per cent stake in the group. He said
the planned flotation would provide additional capital for the group and
enable it to continue to expand in both UK and other markets.
In the 12 months to July 31 1992 CentreGold doubled its pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.7m on sales of Pounds 55.1m and in the eight months to end-March
this year posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m on sales of Pounds 25.3m.
'We have expanded steadily through organic growth,' Mr Brown said.
The group operates through two main subsidiaries - CentreSoft, which
distributes computer and video game entertainment software to 1,300
retailers including the Boots and John Menzies chains, and US Gold, which
publishes PC software and video games for Sega and Nintendo games machines
on both sides of the Atlantic.
Other subsidiaries include Electric Dreams, which sells computer
entertainment software and hardware through concessions within Harrods in
Knightsbridge and Allders in Croydon, and IBD which provides wholesale
distribution of low-cost, often older, business software and peripherals.
CentreSoft ranks among the biggest distributors of Sega and Nintendo games
cartridges in Britain while US Gold ranks among the top six UK publishers.
After producing the official video game for the Barcelona Olympics,
CentreGold now has the rights to next year's winter Olympics in Norway and
World Cup football finals in the US.
CentreGold has been advised by Smith New Court.

SHARPE &amp; Fisher, the Gloucester-based building supplies and property
company, reported pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 little changed
at Pounds 658,000, against Pounds 647,000 restated for FRS 3.
However the comparable figure was boosted by Pounds 245,000 from the sale of
properties and a Pounds 72,000 credit from discontinued activities.
Operating profits this time were ahead at Pounds 937,000 (Pounds 723,000)
helped by an improved performance from building supplies.
The interest charge fell to Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 393,000) as a result of
lower interest rates and earlier collection of amounts due from customers.
Gearing at the period end was 38 per cent.
Earnings per share were 2.1p (2.4p). The interim dividend is being held at
1.5p.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Provision holds Dalgety back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, reported pre-tax profits up
slightly, from Pounds 111.6m to Pounds 112.2m, for the year to June 30,
after making an exceptional provision of Pounds 9m to cover claims
associated with the sale of an insurance business.
Operating profits rose 6 per cent to Pounds 130.4m on increased sales of
Pounds 4.5bn (Pounds 4bn).
A strong performance from the agricultural supplies operation and food
distribution offset a disappointing result from food ingredients.
The group is having to provide Pounds 9m for insurance losses incurred a
decade ago by Bain Clarkson, known as Clarkson Puckle when it was a
subsidiary of Gill and Duffus, the trading group, acquired by Dalgety.
Clarkson was involved in reinsurance cover for US companies against claims
for environmental damage. The scale of the liabilities were not known when
Dalgety sold the insurance company to Inchcape in 1987.
Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the payment closed the matter by
extricating the group from any possible litigation.
Following its recent announcement that it was buying two businesses from
Unigate, the food and distribution group, for Pounds 15.7m, Mr Clothier said
he expected to make further infill acquisitions.
But he warned against speculation that the group was about to make a big
acquisition in Europe. 'We are not going to be rushed into paying silly
prices.'
Food distribution increased operating profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 15.2m
on the back of strong volume growth in both the McDonalds and National
Accounts divisions.
An increase in volumes of consumer foods helped the foods division report a
10 per cent increase to Pounds 65.7m.
Agribusiness increased its market share and cut costs to enable it to
increase profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 32.1m.
However, operating profits from food ingredients fell 24 per cent to Pounds
17.4m, mainly because of the sale of Modern Maid and Federal Bakeries and
the temporary closure of a plant.
Net borrowings of Pounds 49m reflected gearing of 12 per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 35.7p (36.3p), although excluding exceptional
items they rose to 39.4p (38.6p).
The final dividend is raised to 12.65p (12p) giving an increased total of
20.5p (19.5p).
COMMENT
After rationalising its businesses and strengthening its balance sheet,
Dalgety looks well positioned for further growth. A 26 per cent increase in
capital investment to Pounds 81m and a tough cost-cutting programme flowed
through in three of the four divisions which increased operating profits.
The big acquisition continues to prove elusive. Most promising areas in
Europe are snacks and pet foods, but both are dominated by larger players,
which may be why management is so keen to dampen expectations. With forecast
annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 130m the shares are on a prospective
multiple of 13. It may not be a sparkling performer but given the
reliability of earnings the shares still look attractive.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Ferranti International lost 3 3/4 p to 8 1/2 p after the
struggling electronics group said profitability had not improved in the
first few months of its financial year.
Ferranti, which came close to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge
fraud in International Signal and Control, its US subsidiary, said its net
assets had fallen to less than half its share capital.
This had triggered a need for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders, set
for October 7, to decide on its next moves.
Ferranti said it was working on strengthening its balance sheet by equity
injection or partnerships, and on winning new business, rationalising
further and producing a profit.
Ferranti said its board would consider, after a sustained return to profit,
a reduction in capital to allow the resumption of dividends. A suitable
capital reconstruction could be considered at the same time.
However, the board recommended that no such action be taken in the meantime
because there would be no practical benefit for the group and the associated
costs could not be justified.
Ferranti incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 24.5m in the year to March 31,
against a loss of Pounds 46.2m in the previous year.
In June, Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman since 1990, said Ferranti had cut its
bank borrowings from Pounds 700m to less than Pounds 100m since 1989 and
reduced its overdue creditors payments from Pounds 55m to Pounds 19m, but he
said the process needed to be accelerated.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Profits growth slows at EIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest income following last year's five acquisitions for a total of
Pounds 12m in cash slowed the rise in pre-tax profits at EIS Group, the
specialist engineer, to Pounds 7.86m in the six months to June 30.
That compared with Pounds 7.34m last time and was scored on the back of a
Pounds 28.4m improvement in turnover to Pounds 123.9m.
'In April we said that the current arduous climate was likely to continue
through 1993 and we did not see the worldwide downturn in demand for capital
goods ending this year. This has proved to be correct so far,' Mr Peter
Haslehurst, chief executive, said.
He added that 'about Pounds 25m of the sales increase reflected acquisitions
made in the second half of 1992, including Fluidrive and Sime, the
transmission companies, for a net Pounds 4.7m, and the Silleck technical
mouldings companies for Pounds 3.74m,' he added.
First half acquisitions contributed Pounds 528,000 to turnover compared with
Pounds 2.1m in the first half of 1992.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 7.73m (Pounds 6.73m). 'Most of the growth
in profits came from organic growth which in this market is generated by
reductions in costs, by design and by improvements in manufacturing
productivity.'
EIS, which manufactures in 18 countries, said Flexibox had made progress by
developing markets such as seals for environmental protection. There was
some improvement in machinery for plastic, and wire and cable production.
The vacuum and filtration markets remained difficult while aircraft and
precision engineering companies traded in 'thin conditions'.
Interest received fell to Pounds 80,000 (Pounds 573,000). The company said
this reflected its 1992 acquisitions.
The Pounds 24m rights issue in April had been successful, with the proceeds
received in June remaining intact. The cash would allow further
acquisitions.
The interim dividend is being lifted from 3.225p to 3.3p from earnings per
share of 13.12p (12.48p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hamlet listing with Pounds 20m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMLET GROUP, which imports clothing to supply the UK retail trade, is
planning to come to the London market next month with a share offering of
about Pounds 20m.
More than half the shares on offer are expected to be placed with
institutions, with the rest to be offered through intermediaries. Beeson
Gregory are the sponsors.
Hamlet, which began as a family concern in east London in the late 1960s,
was acquired in 1987 by Southend Property Holdings in a cash and shares deal
worth more than Pounds 14m. In 1992 a management buy-out was completed,
leaving the management and Causeway Capital with 80 per cent of the company
and Southend Property with 20 per cent.
About one third of the Pounds 20m listing proceeds will be new money;
another third will be used to repay preference capital; and the remainder
will go to existing shareholders who are sellers. Causeway is not selling
any of its ordinary shareholding of about 35 per cent.
After the flotation, existing shareholders are expected to have about half
the company. Mr Aharan Nathan, managing director, said the proceeds would be
used to reduce debt and increase working capital for future expansion.
In the year to the end of March, Hamlet reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on turnover of Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 32.8m).
About a half of Hamlet's business is in budget priced menswear, with 35 per
cent in ladieswear and the remainder casual clothing. Its customers include
C&amp;A, Top Shop, Freemans and Dorothy Perkins.
Aside from one of its subsidiaries, no single customer accounts for more
than 5 per cent of turnover. At the same time no single supplier accounts
for more than 10 per cent of its supplies. Overseas suppliers are situated
from Hong Kong and China to the United Arab Emirates, Greece and Portugal.

FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Select Appts cuts losses to Pounds 692,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Select Appointments, the USM-quoted international employment agency, cut its
first half pre-tax losses from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 692,000.
The figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 415,000 (Pounds
416,000). These will be reduced in the second half following the repayment
of borrowings to its parent, Waverley, out of the proceeds of the preference
share issue in July.
Turnover increased from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 12.7m, reflecting the recent
acquisitions in the US, Hong Kong and London, which are expected to benefit
performance in the second half.
There was a loss per share of 0.32p (0.44p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / Viacom seeks another gem for its crown jewels: Martin
Dickson reports on the Dollars 8.2bn bid to take over Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIACOM International, which made an Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn) agreed bid
on Sunday for Paramount Communications, has brushed aside speculation that
the deal might flush out a rival bid for Paramount from companies associated
with Mr John Malone, one of the most powerful figures in the US cable
television industry.
Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, said: 'You may be anticipating a war
that doesn't exist.'
Viacom, a fast-growing cable television company best known for its MTV pop
music video channel, agreed to pay Dollars 69.14 a share in cash and stock
for each share in Paramount, the film production and publishing company,
based on Friday night's stock market closing quotes.
The offer consists of Dollars 9.10 in cash, 0.1 of a share of class A Viacom
voting stock and 0.9 of a share of class B non-voting stock.
The agreement installs a poison pill to deter rival bids: if the deal is
terminated Paramount will pay Viacom Dollars 100m.
Viacom's A shares fell Dollars 1 7/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/8 yesterday
and its B shares were down Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 56 3/4 , reducing the
offer to Dollars 66.58 a share and the value of the bid to Dollars 7.9bn.
Paramount rose Dollars 3 3/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/2 .
There has been speculation on Wall Street that the deal could prompt a rival
bid from Mr Malone, who heads both Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the
largest US cable TV service company, and Liberty Media, which has a large
interest in QVC Network, the home shopping cable channel.
QVC is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a highly regarded film industry figure,
who has ambitious expansion plans.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said he had not received, and did
not anticipate, any offers from QVC. Mr Redstone said he doubted Mr Malone
would consider going to war. 'I respect him but I do not fear him,' he said.
Both men praised their deal as a 'marriage made in heaven'. Mr Redstone said
that 'a few dollars (from a rival bid) could never match the potential
rewards in the future of this combination'.
The bid announcement was the culmination of years of on-off merger talks
between Viacom and Paramount. These talks had previously broken down over
questions of boardroom control.
If it goes ahead, the deal will be the biggest takeover in the US media
industry since the Dollars 11.6bn merger between Time and Warner
Communications in 1989, and marks a new stage in the consolidation of the
sector into giant businesses with interests in a diversity of entertainment
formats.
Viacom is best known for its cable television networks - which Mr Redstone
refers to as its crown jewels - which include the rapidly growing pop music
channel MTV and Nickelodeon, which produces zany programmes for children.
The networks are in the throes of an ambitious international expansion to
position Viacom as chief purveyor of entertainment to the world's youth.
Nickelodeon, for example, was launched in the UK at the start of this month,
where it is now being offered to subscribers to British Sky Broadcasting,
along with MTV.
Viacom also owns and operates cable television systems serving some 1.1m US
subscribers and 5 network affiliated TV stations and 14 radio stations.
Paramount's assets include a motion picture production business, with
current hits including the thriller The Firm, and a library of 890 films,
including The Godfather, Indiana Jones and Beverly Hills Cop; and a TV
programming business which includes the comedy Cheers and the science
fiction series Star Trek.
Viacom, which was acquired by Mr Redstone in 1987, is the smaller of the two
companies, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 1.9bn, but its rapid growth has won
it a higher stock market rating than Paramount, which had revenues of
Dollars 4.3bn in 1992 but has suffered from flat earnings for the past few
years.
Wall Street analysts yesterday welcomed the deal as reason-ably priced and
offering a compelling logic: Paramount will bring to Viacom the creative
entertainment production facilities which it lacks, while Viacom's cable
network will greatly increase Paramount's distribution muscle.
The combined group will have a relatively modest debt burden, compared with
many of its rivals, and marriage will better position both companies to
compete with two trends transforming the media industry.
One is globalisation, as a handful of international companies, such as Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, seek to dominate the world's airwaves,
cable networks and publishing outlets.
The other is the rapid convergence between the media, computer, electronics
and telecommunications industries in the US - often dubbed 'communicopia' -
which is expected eventually to create a world of inter-active, multi-media
entertainment.
These forces lie behind a string of media takeovers in the past few years,
including the Time/Warner marriage and a deal earlier this year under which
US West, a large local telephone company, will invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time
Warner's cable and film entertainment operations. Sony, the Japanese
electronics group, acquired Hollywood's Columbia studios in 1989, while
Japanese rival Matsushita Electric bought MCA, parent of Universal Pictures.
If the Paramount takeover goes ahead, it will leave Walt Disney as the only
large Hollywood studio independent of much larger media empires or
conglomerates.
The deal will leave Mr Redstone firmly in the driving seat. He will be
chairman of the merged company - Mr Davis will become chief executive - and
will also hold 69.8 per cent of the combined company's voting stock and 38.5
per cent of its common stock.
For a man who began his career as owner of a chain of drive-in movie houses,
that shows not just tenacity but great business acumen.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Amstrad buys into mobile telephones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics company run by Mr Alan Sugar, has jumped
into the fast-growing mobile telephone equipment business through the
acquisition yesterday of Dancall Radio, the Danish cordless and mobile
telecommunications group, for Pounds 6.4m.
Dancall, based in Pandrup, has been in payments suspension since August and
the acquisition was approved yesterday at a creditors meeting. The Danish
group is one of the last established European stand-alone mobile equipment
businesses designing, assembling and marketing its own brand.
Last year the group, which has an extensive GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile)
digital telephones research and development team, had sales of DKr380m
(Pounds 40m) based on cellular and cordless telephones. GSM is the
pan-European standard for the next generation of mobile telephone systems,
which are just beginning to appear across Europe.
Although relatively unknown in the UK, Dancall has a strong presence in the
Nordic markets - among the most sophisticated in Europe - and has sales in
some 25 overseas markets including the Middle and Far East.
Amstrad has been looking for a consumer electronics market to relace its
'blockbuster' products of the 1980s, which are now in decline. In addition,
the deal effectively enables Amstrad to leapfrog competitors and buy-in
technological and manufacturing expertise.
Mr Sugar has often expressed his interest in expanding Amstrad's
telecommunications equipment side, which already includes Betacom, the
separate, publicly quoted telephone equipment manufacturer in which Amstrad
has a majority stake.
Yesterday the Amstrad chairman said the group would 'unveil further
strategic plans' when it announced its year-end results next month.
Amstrad is forming a new subsidiary, Dancall Telecom, to manage the Danish
operations. Mr Malcolm Miller, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, has
been appointed chairman of the subsidiary, which will and will rehire 200 of
the 600 employees who were laid off when Dancall went into payments
suspension.
'By acquiring Dancall's GSM research and development group we are well
placed amongst a few leaders in GSM technology, as well as for making a
quick move into PCN,' he said.
As part of the deal Mr Miller said Amstrad, which usually subcontracts its
assembly work, will be taking over a state-of-the-art factory and one of
'the world's finest R&amp;D teams'.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Strong yen takes its toll on Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Inchcape fell 5 per cent yesterday after currency movements caused
the international services and marketing group to report interim results
below market expectations.
The UK group's pre-tax profits rose 11.2 per cent to Pounds 130.4m in the
six months to June 30, on sales 29 per cent higher at Pounds 3.01bn.
However, a currency gain of Pounds 16m, caused by sterling's devaluation,
was more than outweighed by the strength of the yen.
Inchcape handles substantial export business out of Japan, including
distributing Toyota cars, and the appreciation of the Japanese currency
reduced profit margins.
The motors business was, nevertheless, Inchcape's strongest area, raising
operating profits 32 per cent to Pounds 102m.
Services, which include insurance, shipping and testing, raised operating
profits 22 per cent to Pounds 27.9m, in spite of the tough Japanese market.
Profits from marketing fell 19 per cent to Pounds 28.1m. Mr Charles Mackay,
chief executive, blamed the Japanese recession and restraints on Malaysian
consumer spending.
Sir David Plastow, chairman, said: 'Although there are signs of recovery in
the UK and US, and Asian economies outside Japan remain strong, this has
been offset by continuing recession in Japan and the steep downturn in
continental Europe.'
He added: 'Some of our markets are healthy or on the mend, others have
become or continue to be difficult. For the present, we can look forward to
continuing to perform well in some areas but shall need to be patient in
others.'
The motors figures were boosted by a three-month contribution from motor
distributor TKM, bought for Pounds 383m in March last year, plus rising
production from Toyota GB's new factory in Derbyshire. Toyota's UK sales
jumped 43 per cent, giving it more than 3 per cent of the market for the
first time. Other UK franchises also performed well, with excellent
contributions from its retail dealerships.
While the UK had at last recovered, Sir David said all the continental
European markets turned decisively downwards. Austerity measures meant car
exports to China were unlikely to be as strong in the second half.
Sir David said Inchcape was no longer committed to its target of keeping
motors, marketing and services in the ratio 50:25:25. He said motors offered
a good opportunity at present, which the group was ready to pursue.
Gearing fell from 43 to 40 per cent per cent. Interest payments increased
from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 15.1m, partly because of investment, and partly
because last year's figure was unusually low.
Earnings per share rose 8.9 per cent to 15.9p (from 14.6p). The interim
dividend rose 7 per cent to 5.8p (from 5.4p).

FT  14 SEP 93 / Huntsman-Packer venture buys Texaco chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the US oil group, yesterday sold of most of its chemical operations
for Dollars 1.06bn (Pounds 680m) as part of the restructuring of the
petrochemicals industry in Europe and the US.
The business is being acquired by a joint venture between Huntsman Financial
Corporation, a subsidiary of Huntsman group, the US's biggest private
chemical company, and Consolidated Press Holdings, Mr Kerry Packer's
Sydney-based media and investment group.
Huntsman Corporation, the 50-50 venture, will be managed by Mr Jon Huntsman,
the chief executive and founder of Huntsman Financial Corporation, and his
family.
Mr Huntsman said the deal showed his and Mr Packer's determination to expand
their global chemical operations. Last year the companies jointly acquired
the Chemplex petrochemical complexes in Melbourne, Australia. The deal
boosts the annual revenues of the Huntsman companies from Dollars 1.8bn to
more than Dollars 3.1bn.
Huntsman also announced it was acquiring the expandable polystyrene
operations of Elf Atochem at Ribecourt in north-east France for an
undisclosed sum. The plant has an annual capacity of about 75,000 tonnes,
although it is operating at only 52,000 tonnes a year because of
overcapacity in the European market. The business had a turnover last year
of more than FFr400m (Pounds 45m).
In a separate deal, Elf Atochem announced it was acquiring the French low
density polyethylene activities of Enichem, the troubled Italian group. The
plant, attached to Elf Atochem's petrochemical facilities at Carling
Saint-Avold in eastern France, has a capacity of 210,000 tonnes a year and a
turnover of about FFr900m. Terms were not disclosed.
Texaco's chemicals operations generated a trading loss of Dollars 49m last
year on turnover of Dollars 1.4bn. The business acquired by Huntsman
Corporation employs more than 2,600 employees and almost 2,500 contractors.
It includes six plants in the US, as well as facilities in Canada, Belgium,
Brazil, Colombia and the UK.
The Huntsman-Texaco deal includes an option for Huntsman Corporation to
acquire either half or all of Texaco's giant Dollars 400m plant at Port
Neches, Texas.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Clarke to hold firm on public pay: Stand against 'catch up'
awards likely to provoke teacher unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will today underline the government's
commitment to tight control of public-sector pay, in a move that seems
likely to provoke further disputes between the government and teachers'
unions.
He will tell the Teachers' Pay Review Body, in a submission from the
Treasury, that the coming year should not be used to compensate public
employees for a year of pay restraint.
The same tough message will be delivered to nurses, doctors and top civil
servants whose salaries are also set by review bodies.
In last November's autumn statement, the government pre-empted the work of
the review bodies, which make recommendations covering about one in four of
public-sector employees, and imposed a 1.5 per cent limit on salary
increases for public-sector workers.
This year, ministers have made clear they will not set a particular figure,
but will expect what Mr Clarke has called the 'current pay realism' to
continue.
Yesterday, teachers' unions made clear that they expect pay rises this year
that allow them to 'catch up' with equivalent jobs in the private sector.
The National Association of Head Teachers called for an award 'well in
excess of any government pay norm'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said that the teaching profession 'must be allowed to catch up the
value lost through the government's misguided public-sector pay policy'.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers' union, is expected to
make its pay claim on Thursday.
In the further-education sector, the Colleges' Employers Forum, which
represents 350 colleges in England and Wales, said it would be offering '1.5
per cent, the maximum allowed under public-sector policy, and no more'.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, said a claim by the National
Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, the largest union
in the sector, would add about 20 per cent to the colleges' wage bill.
College principals are also seeking a high court injunction banning the
union from carrying out a planned one-day strike against proposed new
contracts on September 21.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Bankers welcome Lloyd's guide for raising corporate capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE financiers seeking to persuade institutions and individuals to
invest in Lloyd's yesterday welcomed the publication of a new guide for
corporate investors, increasing hopes that the insurance market can attract
fresh capital next year.
The Lloyd's guide outlines the terms on which corporate members with limited
liability will be able to trade at the market. Final approval of the scheme,
originally mooted 18 months ago, depends on a vote by Names, the individuals
whose assets support the market, at an extraordinary general meeting on
October 20.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said existing Names would not be
'squeezed out' by corporate capital, arguing that new corporate money would
compensate for a decline in commitments by existing Names after losses of
more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said corporate investors would bring
new confidence and security to the market.
Based on a draft circulated in July, the guide contains few surprises for
bankers, who are working on a variety of investment trust and investment
company schemes to support syndicates.
It states that corporate members must have minimum net assets of Pounds 1.5m
and must deposit an amount equal to 50 per cent of their capacity (the
amount of premium they are allowed to underwrite) with Lloyd's.
Syndicates would normally be allowed to obtain no more than 50 per cent of
their capacity from corporate members, and no more than 25 per cent from one
corporate member alone.
Sir Laurie Magnus, director and head of corporate finance at Samuel Montagu,
the merchant bank, which with James Capel is aiming to raise up to Pounds
250m to support a range of Lloyd's syndicates, said the guide was 'along the
right lines. We're reasonably confident'. Mr Marty Dolan, part of the
corporate finance team at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The rules look good
although they require detailed study.'
However, bankers cautioned that success was not guaranteed. 'Our
institutions are quite excited but they will want to see the small print,'
said Sir Laurie.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Factory prices at virtual standstill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIRTUAL standstill in the prices of manufactured goods last month
confirmed the weakness of inflationary pressures in the economy.
In spite of growing domestic demand, the prices of finished manufactured
goods were only marginally higher in August, according to official figures.
The output price index rose 4.3 per cent in the year to August, compared
with a revised 4.2 per cent in the year to July.
Although that was the highest rate for two years and 1 percentage point
higher than the rate of increase at the beginning of the year, the slow
growth of producer prices suggests that manufacturers have chosen to absorb
the higher cost of imports that followed the devaluation of sterling a year
ago.
Excluding food, drink, tobacco and petroleum - volatile elements that are
believed to distort the underlying picture of inflation - the index rose by
0.3 per cent month on month to give a 2.6 per cent increase in the year to
August. That compared with 2.5 per cent in the year to July.
The prices of inputs - raw materials and fuel used by manufacturers - fell
by a non seasonally adjusted 1 per cent in August compared with July.
Compared with the same month a year ago, producer input prices were up 6.2
per cent, compared with 6.3 per cent in July.
The Central Statistical Office said the month-on-month fall largely
reflected seasonal falls in the prices of home-produced food manufacturing
inputs. On a seasonally adjusted basis, input prices rose by 0.1 per cent,
month on month.
The level of input prices has remained roughly stable since March after
rapid gains immediately after devaluation. Most of the annual increase in
input prices reflects sterling's depreciation.

FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots' campaign to persuade the City that its core chemist chain is sound in
wind and limb has been pretty successful if the recent share price
performance is any guide. Boots The Chemist's margins and high return on
capital are considered sustainable because BTC matches Superdrug's prices on
a basket of goods. Besides, in other areas such as product ranges, quality,
stock control, and standard of staff BTC is ahead by a street. Superdrug, it
is alleged, makes so much of price because it has nothing else to say.
In so far as it goes this is quite a good line, yet the risk remains that
some of the mud slung by Superdrug may stick. Marks and Spencer countered
stagnant sales and fears of uncompetitive pricing with its successful
'Outstanding Value' campaign last autumn. BTC could perhaps regain the
initiative on value with a similar exercise. A larger threat, however, comes
from the food retailers. If a serious price war breaks out among the
grocers, they may also cut margins on other goods, such as toiletries. While
food retailers only stock limited ranges, any quantum shift in toiletry
prices would force BTC to respond. Given its advantages Boots would
doubtless emerge a winner from any price war, but the cost to margins could
be substantial.
Boots' management is understandably more upbeat. Its vision, though, sees
Boots The Chemist as a kind of infernal Sorcerer's Apprentice, throwing off
cash at an ever increasing rate. Finding a home for that money will be a
challenge for a company which has scarcely covered itself with glory in its
attempts to diversify.

FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With rules for the admission of corporate capital now on the table,
investment bankers can start to hawk their Lloyd's insurance funds in
earnest. But even assuming the rules are approved by disaffected Names next
month, committing capital to Lloyd's is an act of faith. There can be no
guarantee that corporate members will not be asked to meet the cost of old
claims. Litigation could yet ruin the members' agents on which corporate
members will depend for advice and access to the best underwriting
syndicates.
With insurance rates hardening, the lure of rising profits will doubtless
overcome these fears. Yet picking winners among the range of investment
vehicles likely to be paraded this autumn will be no easy matter.
Underwriting success turns on the choice of syndicates, so the quality of
analysis employed by each fund is clearly crucial. The danger is that all
the analysis will point in the same direction. Since Lloyd's does not
benefit from a price mechanism to allocate new capital, the ability of a
corporate Name to elbow its way to the front of the syndicate queue may be
just as important.
Listed Lloyd's investment companies will be the easiest route for many
investors. The prospect of a 25 per cent return on capital is enticing even
if - thanks to Lloyd's three year accounting - return by way of yield will
be modest until 1997. Still, that does not justify sending the shares to a
premium to net assets without proof the managers can pick the right risks.

FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Viacom/Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom International's proposed Dollars 8.2bn takeover of Paramount
Communications is one of those rare deals which is difficult to fault. The
commercial fit is obvious, despite the limited prospect of cost savings.
Paramount's film studio will bring production capability which Viacom
currently lacks. The combined group will have the clout to compete
effectively with Time Warner and to be an attractive partner for telephone
companies anxious to muscle in on the multimedia business.
The price of such deals - as Time Warner knows to its cost - is often a
weaker balance sheet. In this instance the opposite is the case. Since
Paramount has no net debt, the deal will reduce Viacom's gearing, even
taking account of the Dollars 1bn it is to pay in cash. The merged group
should have comfortable interest cover of around four times next year. Nor,
after the 50 per cent rise in its share price this year, does Viacom have to
worry about the dilutive effect of using its paper to make an acquisition.
The risk was always that it could become involved in a bidding war which
would change the arithmetic by forcing it to shell out too much cash. Thanks
partly to Paramount's poison pill, the chance of a counterbid looks small.
Viacom may thus walk away with Paramount at a reasonable price. The trouble
with such good deals is that they engender high expectations from investors.
On a cash-flow multiple in the high teens Viacom looks expensive compared
with Time Warner despite the latter's debt.

FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Inchcape's slow puncture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market grew so excited about Inchcape's overseas earnings after
sterling's devaluation it blinded itself to the countervailing margin
squeeze that stemmed from the rising yen. By virtue of its big Toyota
distributorship, Inchcape resembles a proxy Japanese company. Yesterday's 5
per cent fall in Inchcape's shares prompted by disappointing interim results
was the penalty for such oversight.
Inchcape did well to offset the margin pain by driving for extra volume,
helping Toyota increase its UK car sales by 43 per cent. Moreover, the
margin pressure should ease once higher car prices are absorbed by the UK
market and Toyota steps up its manufacturing output from Derby.
Nevertheless, the strong yen will continue to depress Inchcape's second
half. Throw in the sharp drop in demand from mainland Europe and recent
Chinese austerity measures, and Inchcape's immediate prospects grow still
duller. The company's recent acquisitions, which contributed just Pounds
400,000 of operating profit on sales of Pounds 47.3m, add an edge of
concern. A variety of setbacks in Japanese brewing, Malaysian consumer
goods, and Australian motors provide a few more worries.
That said, Inchcape's long-term appeal as a well-managed means of riding the
Chinese economic wave remains undiminished. That alone should limit the fall
in the shares. But these results serve as a useful reminder that
distributors can face a particularly painful crush when manufacturers'
margins are squeezed.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank move fails to cheer bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets gave a muted response to the Bundesbank's decision
to cut rates last Thursday, and the week saw declines in virtually all the
senior bourses.
The UBS global research team comments that the less than euphoric response
to the German move reflected not just the cautious nature of the easing, but
also the restrained action of the Bank of France in lowering only its five
to 10-day repo rate.
Morgan Stanley's European strategists believe there is likely to be a 5 to 8
per cent correction in the Continental markets, caused by two factors:
'First . . . it is not that the markets have gone too far, they have just
gone too fast in August. Second, it is worrying that enthusiasm for equity
markets in Europe depends solely on bullishness about interest rates.'
Italy was a big loser last week on the FT-Actuaries World index, in spite of
seeing a rate cut of its own.
The bourse, consolidating after its strong summer run, was overcome by
worries about the prospect of imminent capital increases from a number of
companies, most notably Fiat, although the group denied that it had any such
plans.
Mr William Cowan of James Capel expects the current consolidation to
continue in coming weeks, as the market begins to focus on a forth-coming
stream of six-month figures.
He sees little room for a further reduction in Italian interest rates until
the budget overcomes potential political hurdles and wins full parliamentary
approval.
Norway was another large loser as it continued the consolidation that
started in mid-August and business was restrained ahead of yesterday's
general election. However, Bikuben Securities forecasts that further cuts in
interest rates will strengthen Norwegian equities in the longer term.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Airtours directors sell Pounds 20m of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN directors of Airtours, the travel group, yesterday sold Pounds 20.8m
of shares in the company but said this year's performance would be better
than last.
Airtours said the sale had been prompted by the need to broaden the
shareholder base and increase the liquidity of the group's shares.
The 5.2m ordinary shares were sold to institutional clients of Hoare Govett
Securities for 403p a share. Hoare Govett were appointed Airtours' brokers
last week, replacing Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Airtours' shares fell 6p to
close at 409p.
Airtours said that even after the sale, directors continued to own 42.4 per
cent of the shares.
It said bookings for summer 1993 had been 20 per cent ahead of last year.
Hoare Govett said it was upgrading its forecast of 1992-93 full-year pre-tax
profits from Pounds 41m to Pounds 44m, after Pounds 9m costs incurred in the
bid, which failed earlier this year, for rival Owners Abroad. Pre-tax
profits last year were Pounds 36.5m.
The largest seller of shares was Mr David Crossland, chairman, who disposed
of 2.6m shares with a total value of Pounds 10.6m. He retains 30m shares.
The other directors who sold shares were Mr Tom Trickett, product review
director, Mr Hugh Collinson, managing director, Mr Harry Coe, finance
director, Mr Ton Waslander, Mr George Marcall and Mr Michael Lee. Mr
Trickett will retire in January 1994.
Mr Coe, Mr Waslander and Mr Marcall yesterday sold shares bought through
options in the past few days. The exercise price ranged from 31.75p to 36p.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Limiting the risks at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has taken a decisive step towards abandoning its proudest
boast: the unlimited liability, down to the last cuff-link, of everyone who
stands behind the market's insurance policies.
Nonetheless, the rules under which limited liability companies will be
allowed to become Lloyd's members, published yesterday, offer the best hope
of preserving the rest of the market's traditions.
Lloyd's faces four interlinked problems: the trail of 'long-tail' claims for
environmental and product liabilities under old US policies; the litigation
crisis, which has threatened to tie up much of the market in an endless
spiral of claims and lawsuits about the underwriting errors of the late
1980s and early 1990s; the flight of capital, as Names damaged by those
losses take the first opportunity to escape from the market; and the growing
threat to Lloyd's from rival centres, especially Bermuda.
If the attempt to woo corporate capital is successful, it will address each
of these issues. Once professional investors start to take advantage of the
new incorporated Lloyd's vehicles, they will be signalling their faith in
the management's strategy of erecting a 'ring-fence' to protect new
participants from the damage of the past. A vote of confidence in the
ring-fence is the best indicator available that the long-tail and litigation
problems are not enough to threaten Lloyd's survival, as at one time seemed
possible.
The supply of incorporated funds will also help ensure Lloyd's has a strong
enough capital base in the future to underwrite the scale of business
necessary to cover its fixed costs. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief
executive, says the market is not facing an immediate shortfall of capital,
but needs corporate funds as a guarantee that future inflows will be
adequate to meet its needs.
Similarly, a flood of new capital would be an indication that, though
Lloyd's is losing its monopoly on specialist insurance skills, it still has
the power to attract new money.
Much turns, therefore, on the response to the new incorporated
opportunities. Initial indications are positive: investment banks say that,
despite the damage of recent years, the Lloyd's name and the current healthy
state of reinsurance rates are enough to attract keen investor interest.
Mr Middleton is well aware, however, that the key to success is the extent
to which Lloyd's meets its new goals of lower costs and greater
professionalism. Without that, Lloyd's brave gesture of opening itself to
corporate membership will be an empty one. In the long run, capital is only
available to financial institutions demonstrating sustained profitability.
Once, that was Lloyd's second-proudest boast. The market's members must hope
it proves more durable than the first.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: UN killing field
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE WENT to Somalia to prevent people from starving to death. Now we are
killing women and children. It's got to stop.' With those words, Senator
John McCain of Arizona last week summed up the dilemma facing the US and
other troops participating in the United Nations operation in Somalia. What
started as a humanitarian mission has become a military quagmire. What hope
the UN ever had of beginning the task of national reconciliation and
restoring a semblance of normal administration has been lost. Its troops are
locked in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with Mogadishu's principal warlord,
Gen Aideed, and increasing numbers of the capital's citizens are being
caught in the crossfire.
And for what purpose? Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general,
blithely insists that the men operating under his flag are engaged in a
campaign 'to reconstruct (Somalia's) political, social and material
infrastructure', to disarm warring factions, apprehend 'criminal elements'
and establish a national police force, prison system and judiciary.
That is not how it looks on the ground. Conditions may have improved in the
Somali countryside, but the capital risks becoming a killing field. UN
officials argue that apprehending Gen Aideed is crucial to their mission and
that they cannot allow his shameless use of children as human shields to
divert them. But there is at least as great a danger that the onslaught on
his fiefdom in southern Mogadishu will simply inflame the situation further.
Insufficient effort is being devoted to a political initiative of the sort
that alone can give representative Somali leaders a stake in determining
their future. Nor do UN officials show much sign of being ready to take on
the full civil and administrative responsibilities that their involvement in
a country without a government implies. Indeed, they cannot, for their
political masters in New York have yet to face up to the consequences of
their decisions and make Somalia a UN trusteeship. Their failure to do so
leaves the operation in a legal limbo, reliant on a military campaign as
open-ended as it is inadequate, and shorn of political legitimacy among
Somalis themselves.
It is time for Mr Boutros Ghali and for the Security Council to take direct
control and reappraise what they are trying to achieve. If they conclude
that a broader-based initiative involving political reconciliation and
administrative reconstruction is feasible and affordable, they should
undertake it without delay. If not, they should pull out. Doing so would not
necessarily make it any harder to deliver humanitarian aid than it has
already become. And any harm the UN would thereby inflict on the credibility
of its peacekeeping operations elsewhere would be small compared with the
damage it will do by sinking further into the quagmire.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Dolorosa vita in the public sector: Italy's budget
concentrates on spending cuts rather than increased taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As governor of the Bank of Italy for 13 years, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi took
successive governments to task for inadequate budgets and lax control of
public spending.
The 72-year-old former central banker has now had a chance to practise what
he has been preaching in his first budget. This was presented in detail last
Friday, and will shortly be debated in parliament. Steering the budget
through parliament could be the last act of what is a transitional
government, preparing for early elections under new laws probably next
spring.
Reactions so far have been subdued but parliament is likely to give Prime
Minister Ciampi a rough ride. 'The first we knew of the details was from the
newspapers,' commented one senior Christian Democrat politician.
For the first time, the budget was drawn up on economic and technical
criteria rather than overtly political considerations. The politicians in
the notional four-party coalition which provides Mr Ciampi's parliamentary
majority, were given little say. The proposed shake-up in the public
administration and cuts in civil service privileges - the focal point of Mr
Ciampi's axe - will face strong resistance because they aim to cut away at a
network of politically controlled client relationships established over the
past 45 years.
As with the current year's budget introduced by the Amato government, the
choices have been dictated by circumstances. To recoup international
credibility and bring Italy's finances more in line with those elsewhere in
the EC, the public sector deficit has to be brought down well below 10 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Ciampi and his team of three economics ministers have had to balance the
clear need for continued austerity against the fear of sending the economy
into an even deeper recession. Thus, on the one hand, if public spending had
gone unchecked, the deficit next year would have risen to more than 11 per
cent of GDP. This was even after the 1993 budget raised an unprecedented
L93,000bn (Pounds 2.94bn) through extra taxes and spending cuts.
On the other hand, domestic demand has contracted sharply in the first half
of this year - demand for consumer durables and capital goods dropped 10 per
cent - and the number of jobless has risen to more than 10.5 per cent of the
active population. The recession, which began in mid-1992, has yet to bottom
out. Only on the most optimistic scenarios will the recovery start in the
first quarter of 1994, and yesterday Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor of the
Bank of Italy, warned that any pick-up in employment would lag behind the
first signs of recovery.
Within these parameters, the government has decided to hold the public
sector deficit down to L144,000bn - equivalent to 8.7 per cent of GDP -
compared with this year's L155,000bn. To do this, the government will be
raising some L32,000bn.
'The big difference is that this year we have put nearly all our emphasis on
raising money through spending cuts rather than increasing taxes - the level
of taxation should actually drop 1 per cent,' said one official involved in
formulating the budget.
Traditionally, Italian budgets have raised money through one-off measures or
increasing taxes (and so encouraging greater tax evasion). The Amato
government relied heavily for the 1993 budget on new taxes, including the
introduction of a highly unpopular 'minimum tax' designed to catch the large
number of self-employed in the tax net by fixing minimal assessments for
specific jobs.
Rather than raise taxes, this budget concentrates on the cost-cutting side.
This is being done both in the form of across-the-board ministerial spending
cuts; and more importantly through structural changes. Government
departments are to be rationalised and given performance targets. A series
of inter-ministerial committees and other quangos are being abolished; some
100,000 civil servants are being told to switch jobs or leave, and there is
a freeze on employment. Bureaucrats can no longer assume they have jobs for
life or opt for the early retirement of 20 years' work on a full pension. In
future, those who leave before 35 years' work will lose their pension rights
on a progressive scale.
The education ministry, controlling 1.1m persons in the form of teachers and
bureaucrats, a third of all state employers, will have individual budgets
and the number of teachers will be cut to reflect the country's static
population (Italy has the lowest student-teacher ratio in Europe because
teachers have been hired annually on a quota basis regardless of trends in
school population).
Unlike the previous two budgets, which have contained unrealistic estimates
of privatisation revenues, such asset disposals will go towards debt
reduction and not be counted as a budget receipt. Ministers estimate that
the combined effect of these administrative reforms could save L4,000bn;
but, they add, the figure could go as high as L10,000bn, or more than a
third of all the cuts being sought.
Mr Ciampi pointedly said last week: 'We are spreading the burden of
sacrifice equally, above all on those in stable employment.' The public
sector has been pampered for too long, and as if to underline the point
there will only be L1,000bn for wage increases next year. This is under half
the projected 3.7 per cent annual rate of inflation for 1994.
Economists, as well as Mr Ciampi's former colleagues in the Bank of Italy,
have focused less on the 1994 budget and more on the three-year outline
strategy behind it. According to Professor Mario Monti, a leading Italian
economist, the three-year macroeconomic plan is too modest in reducing both
the public sector deficit and the overall size of the debt mountain.
For instance, by 1996 the public sector deficit is still expected to be 5.8
per cent of GDP. As for the overall size of Italy's debt, a third of all the
EC's, this is forecast to go on rising from 110 per cent to 123 per cent of
GDP by 1996, before dropping. The continued need to borrow heavily and the
cost of debt service - about L180,000bn a year - explains the government's
determination to emphasise the primary balance in the 1994 budget - nearly 2
per cent of GDP. In other words, strip out the cost of debt service and
Italy's public finances already show an improvement.
The debt service is costly. But each percentage point drop in interest rates
permits an annual saving of nearly L15,000bn. Compared with this time last
year, when Europe's currency crisis forced the Bank of Italy to defend the
lira with a discount rate of 15 per cent, the rate is now just over half at
8.5 per cent - the lowest since 1976. Italy still has a real interest rate
of nearly 5 per cent, high in relation to its main EC partners. But this is
an inevitable consequence of having to provide attractive rates for
investors to buy Italian debt.
Attracting buyers of Italian debt in turn makes it difficult for the Bank of
Italy to encourage the further fall in interest rates, which industrialists
are clamouring for to ease them through the remainder of the recession. The
industrialists nevertheless are benefiting from a deceleration in the wages
bill. On average, private sector wages have increased this year at just over
4 per cent, below the level of inflation; while public sector pay rises have
been even more restricted.
In July the employers, unions and government signed a historic tripartite
agreement which removed the traditional linkage between inflation and wages.
The pact laid down that for the next four years wages could not exceed
inflation and increases had to be linked to productivity. This removed the
worry of any wage-fed inflation as the unions place job security above pay,
providing the agreement is honoured.
Modest wage demands, combined with last September's devaluation and float of
the lira outside the ERM, have had a dramatic impact on exports, which have
grown this year by 11 per cent to the EC. The surge in exports, despite
recession in Germany and France, Italy's main markets, has helped offset the
decline in domestic demand and sustain jobs.
The success of Italy's exports has underlined the value of its competitive
devaluation. But it has also raised questions about how and when Italy can
rejoin the ERM. The floating lira is too convenient to discard for the time
being.
Parliament has until December 30 to approve the budget but this deadline
could slip as in the past. If Mr Ciampi wants quick assent he will have to
resort to confidence motions, and this will show the weakness of the
government coalition and underline that only a newly elected parliament can
tackle in depth Italy's public finances.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Cold comfort in future: David Lascelles on a study that
points to a greater reliance on coal and nuclear power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world has enough energy to last at least another 50 years, which is
roughly when the oil and gas are expected to run out. But after that, what?
A futuristic look at the world's energy supplies has just been compiled by
the World Energy Council, a non-governmental organisation representing more
than 100 countries. Energy for Tomorrow's World tries to supply some of the
answers.
Sure, there will be new-fangled inventions such as hot rocks, super
batteries and cars that run on water. New industrial processes using much
less energy will also be developed. But none of them can be predicted with
certainty. Nor does the report think that renewables such as wind, solar and
tidal can make more than a marginal contribution because of their natural
limitations.
The two energy sources most likely to meet demand in the second half of the
next century, the WEC thinks, are coal and nuclear power. Reserves of coal
are currently sufficient for another 250 years, though that may shrink if we
start burning more of it. The technical potential for nuclear power is
'immense', according to the report.
This conclusion, though not wholly original, is bound to send shudders down
millions of spines. These are precisely the fuel sources which give rise to
the greatest controversy today and for which there is probably the least
amount of popular support.
Assuming the report is right (the four-year effort that went into it makes
it one of the most thorough ever compiled), what can the world do about it?
Several things, according to its authors.
The first is to try to curb the growth in demand. If we only tinker with the
problem, energy consumption could nearly double between now and 2020. This
would put a heavy strain on resources, particularly in the third world where
most of this growth will occur. But an energy efficiency drive could reduce
that growth to only 28 per cent over the same period, providing benefits not
just to the energy picture but also the environment. The scope for energy
saving is huge: a modern industrial economy wastes more than 95 per cent of
the fuel it consumes in traffic jams, heat loss and inefficient electricity
generation.
The second is to use technology to find better ways of providing energy:
recovering more from known reserves, or developing unconventional fossil
fuels such as tar sands, shale oil and synthetic gas.
The third is to jack up the price of energy to make it reflect environmental
costs which are currently 'free' such as the atmosphere. 'There will be a
growing awareness that the price of energy has in general terms been too
cheap . . .' says the report.
The fourth is to develop ways of making coal and nuclear more acceptable.
Technology can go 'a long way' towards cleaning up coal, and by early next
century advanced gasification techniques could be in use. The situation with
nuclear is more complicated because it is both a matter of developing
advanced technologies, and convincing the public that nuclear power is safe,
and that radioactive waste can be handled. Known supplies of uranium are not
sufficient to keep nuclear power going in the long term, which means that
the industry will have to turn to 'breeder' technology which uses the even
more unpopular plutonium. However, nuclear fusion, which uses light elements
such as hydrogen or helium, could be in commercial use by 2040.
A factor that weighs heavily in the balance of choice is the environment.
The WEC report says that the deterioration of the atmosphere is likely to
continue for much longer than is implied by recent international agreements
to curb carbon dioxide emissions (industrial countries have pledged to
reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2000). Only the most 'ecologically
driven' of the report's four scenarios sees a fall in atmospheric CO levels
during the next century. In all the others it continues to rise beyond 2100,
mainly because of population growth in the third world. The report remains
agnostic on whether carbon dioxide causes global warming, as many believe,
but leaves little doubt about the trends.
For once, this is not a doomsday report about the lights going out. But it
will be a scare story for people who are concerned about heavy reliance on
nuclear and coal - at least as we know those fuels today. The message the
authors want to get across is that today's energy abundance must not obscure
the need for timely action to deal with next century's problems.

The plight of the poor old Tories has resulted in a rash of stories - some
in cataclysmic terms - in the British media lately. No, not the PM's waning
popularity or the revolt waiting to happen at the party conference but the
suggestion that the party's finances are less than ideally healthy.
But lo] Talk of the deficit, put at Pounds 19m by some, has produced a
trickle of cheques into Conservative headquarters at Smith Square,
accompanied by letters from loyal supporters saying that they hadn't
realised the situation was so grim.
'We're still waiting for the Pounds 19m cheque, but it all helps,' said a
grateful party official yesterday.

Peter Middleton, the chief executive of Lloyd's of London and renowned
motorbike enthusiast, has been making good use of biking jargon. The
attachment of stabilisers to a motorbike, he argued yesterday, was
comparable to the introduction of corporate capital to Lloyd's; corporate
capital would add both confidence and security to the beleaguered Lloyd's
market as it attempts to claw back profitability.
Middleton, who regularly commutes from his west London home to the City, had
good reason to be thinking along those metaphorical lines. On Friday night
his 800cc Suzuki skidded in front of an oncoming car, depositing the Lloyd's
chief into Gracechurch Street. Fortunately he was only bruised, and not so
badly as Lloyd's.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: Jurassic jitters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To listen to France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon, you would think that
Stephen Spielberg's 'velociraptors' were about to step off French screens
and devour their audiences.
At last weekend's Deauville festival of American films, Toubon cited
Jurassic Park - released in France next month - as the latest example of
Hollywood's cultural invasion of his country.
Such is the dominance of US film-makers and distributors that one in every
five French cinemas will be showing it, he complained; the dinosaur
spectacular 'is very impressive, but not at all moving nor human, because of
its special effects, and it threatens the French identity'.
But, despite the fears of Toubon, many French seem to be happy to let their
identity be threatened. A poll last month for the Nouvelle Economiste
magazine showed that 80-83 per cent of those in the prime cinema-going age
group of 18-34 considered American productions as good or better than French
films.

Would that Peter the Great were still ruling his empire. Well, that's one
school of thought; it seems that in the highest levels at the Kremlin,
Russia's elite falls into two camps when it comes to foreign policy.
According to a poll of 130 top Russian diplomats and politicians conducted
by the Moscow office of the Friedrich Ebert Fund, the German social
democratic think-tank, Moscow's foreign policy establishment is now divided
between the 'westernisers' - who favour a US or European-style democracy -
and the 'slavophiles' - who hanker after a return to a Peter the Great style
of government.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent would like to see a return to strong
authoritarian rule or dictatorship; even fewer - 4 per cent - think Russia
should once more become a superpower. More than half are content to be just
one of the world's five great powers; 30 per cent would be happy to make it
to the top 15.
A market system is favoured by 81 per cent and a majority thinks that
Mikhail Gorbachev was a good thing. Top of the list for favourite
non-Russian country was Germany.
But one of the poll's findings suggests that history does indeed repeat
itself. Most of those who participated believe that the current crop of
politicians is more corrupt, greedy, immoral, hypocritical and ruthless than
the pre-1985 communists.

The prominent City members of the Cadbury committee appear to have placed
greater emphasis on honing their corporate responsibility skills than on
exercising the profit motive.
For although the report of the committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury and published in
December last year, has become an unexpected best-seller, with nearly 7,000
copies flogged to date at Pounds 10 a go, the committee does not stand to
benefit.
And that robust sales figure comes on top of the 5,000-odd copies which
Cadbury required to be sent free to companies and accountancy firms.
Sales of the report should have generated a tidy sum for Gee, part of
Professional Publishing, which printed the report. However, Gee will be the
only beneficiary, as the committee signed away to the publishers all its
rights to sale proceeds, royalties and reproduction fees from other
publishers.
The committee should have known better. Its draft report, issued last July
and distributed for free to encourage comments, was so popular it had to
send out 13,500 copies, footing the printing and postage bill itself.
Having relinquished the opportunity of making some money from its
activities, the Cadbury committee will now have to rely on continued
sponsorship from sympathetic organisations and businesses if it is to fulfil
its plans for future work.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Greek morass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A long spell of profligacy during the 1980s, Greece has made steady,
though still inadequate, progress towards improving its chronically poor
reputation for economic management. Restrictive monetary and fiscal measures
undertaken by Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis have succeeded in
halving the budget deficit from the 1990 figure of 21 per cent of gross
domestic product. Inflation has fallen to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The
current account deficit has declined to less than 3 per cent of GDP, partly
owing to increased EC transfers, now about 5 per cent of GDP.
These changes, coinciding with Europe-wide recession and the consequences of
the Yugoslav conflict, have been sufficiently painful to increase Mr
Mitsotakis's electoral unpopularity. But they have not gone far enough to
correct fundamental flaws in the economic and political structure of the
poorest member of the EC. As a result of last week's resignation of Mr
Mitsotakis's government, prompted by an internal revolt, Greece faces
general elections on October 10, bringing political uncertainty that could
delay or reverse necessary reforms.
The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement is ahead in the opinion polls.
But its leadership looks unsuited to solving Greece's problems of low growth
and investment, high subsidies, an undersized manufacturing base and a
large, inefficient public sector. The party is headed by the ailing Mr
Andreas Papandreou, whose wayward prime ministership between 1981 and 1989
greatly exacerbated these difficulties. Although the Socialists have toned
down their interventionist policies, their return would disrupt Greece's
efforts at privatisation and deregulation.
Furthermore, the election campaign could stir up more squabbling over former
Yugoslavia, further lowering Greece's ability to play a positive role in EC
policies towards the Balkans. Last week's rebellion against Mr Mitsotakis
was led by Mr Antonis Samaras, the former foreign minister, sacked last year
for refusing to compromise over EC recognition of neighbouring Macedonia.
Whichever party holds power must face up to unpalatable realities. Greece
should put aside any illusions of participating in economic and monetary
union for at least a decade, probably for much longer. Its main priority
must be to bring its governmental and industrial infrastructure into line
with modern requirements.
EC funding has a considerable part to play in assisting this transition. But
the money will not be forthcoming unless the country makes still greater
efforts to achieve convergence with its European neighbours. That will
require strict monitoring from Brussels, as well as strong will in Athens.
Since it joined the EC in 1981, Greece has become an ever more marginalised
member of a wider Community. Unless Greece achieves better macroeconomic
balance, and presses on with administrative reform, that uncomfortable
process will accelerate in the 1990s, as the EC turns its attention
increasingly to new members in the north and east of the continent.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Birth rights and wrongs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was alarming to read last week that the use of caesarean operations to
deliver British babies has nearly trebled over the past two decades. It
would not have happened if the hospitals and senior doctors had not wrested
the delivery business away from perfectly competent midwives. As we shall
see in a moment, the government is preparing to help the midwives win back
their lost customer base. It will be a struggle, but even we males must
cheer from the sidelines.
The disturbing news comes in 'Caesarean Birth in Britain', whose authors
include Professor Wendy Savage. Remember her? A celebrated campaigner for
the right to natural childbirth, she is still consultant obstetrician at the
Royal London hospital. Her fellow-writers are Helen Lewison, chairman of the
National Childbirth Trust, and two academics. The four of them note that in
1973 the proportion of deliveries by caesarean in England and Wales was an
estimated 5.3 per cent. By last year, their research suggests, this figure
had risen to 13 per cent.
The book contains a table of hospitals self-confident enough to allow their
data to be published. It shows that the caesarean operation was used in 7.9
per cent of deliveries at St John's hospital, Chelmsford, and 21.5 per cent
in Hammersmith, with all the numbers you can think of in between. Even if
you take account of the careful note that 'hospitals with high rates may
well have specialist units and so receive pregnancies which are at greater
risk' this variation is too wide to be explicable to lay observers. The
inescapable conclusion is that some caesareans may be medically necessary,
but that many are probably not.
This is clearly true in the US where in 1991 nearly a quarter of all babies
were delivered by caesarean, at a cost of Dollars 7.7bn. That is the highest
caesar-rate bar Brazil's, at doubtless the highest cost per delivery bar
none, yet the US infant mortality record is worse than that of Japan,
Sweden, Holland or Britain. Fear of being sued is one reason, but the
self-interest of the surgeon must surely be another.
The use of the obstetrician's knife has increased in most developed
countries, in concert, I suspect, with a growth in the sales of Jaguars,
Mercedes and Cadillac cars to successful consultants. The process is not
otherwise comprehensible. According to a US study, within a team of
obstetricians caring for 1,553 affluent low-risk women at a community
hospital, one practitioner operated in 19.1 per cent of births, another at a
rate of 42.3 per cent.
Talk to almost any new mother and you will be deluged with anecdotal
evidence suggesting that the convenience of the hospital, or its
consultants, has a lot to do with the growth in the use of technological
interventions. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK secretary for health, should
arrange for league tables to be published annually, showing which maternity
units use the most forceps deliveries, which the most caesareans, which
induce labour most often - and which produce the highest proportions of
healthy infants. Explanations and excuses could accompany the lists.
She should, however, be warned. The consultants, presumably excluding
Professor Savage, will squeal. The West Midlands Regional Health Authority
published league tables showing how long patients must wait for an operation
with each of its 2,000 consultant surgeons. The British Medical Association
was outraged. We may place our lives in the hands of this or that medical
specialist, but doctors acting in a collective cannot be trusted with our
wallets. Their trade unions, like the BMA, are among the most astute in the
business; the higher up the professional scale their associations go, the
more wily they become.
This is being demonstrated once again in the argument about midwives. A few
weeks ago the government published a report on the maternity services drawn
up by an expert committee under the chairmanship of Baroness Cumberlege. It
noted the current department of health view that births should take place in
hospital, since 'unforeseen complications can occur in any birth', and set
against it last year's pronouncement from the House of Commons select
committee on health that 'encouraging all women to give birth in hospitals
cannot be justified on grounds of safety'.
The Cumberlege report puts into moderate, semi-official language the deepest
wishes of the National Childbirth Trust, aspirations that were once regarded
as cranky nonsense. It calls for 'woman-centred care', meaning that the
prospective mother should be in control. She should be able to choose who
takes her case, be it midwife, general practitioner or obstetrician. She
should be able to arrange for a home birth, although she should then be
given a health warning about the risks. She might reasonably expect that the
same person, or the same small group of professionals, should manage the
whole of her pregnancy. She should be fully informed of the options at all
times, and have the right to take possession of her own case-notes.
The simple idea is that most confinements are straightforward, and thus
capable of being brought to a happy conclusion at home or by the woman's
personal midwife admitted (heavens]) to hospital with her. There have been
tragedies in non-hospital births, but the same applies to births within
high-tech maternity units. The report questions the assumption that
'experienced personnel are already readily available within a general
hospital'. You might think that the consultants would embrace it
enthusiastically, since releasing non-complicated births to the midwives
would leave them more time in which to concentrate on the awkward cases.
Not so. The Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists says that it is
'genuinely concerned' that some of the proposals in the Cumberlege report
'may endanger the wellbeing of women and their babies'. It insists that
'review of every pregnancy by a medically qualified person is essential' -
surely right - but insists that 'the doctor best qualified to conduct that
review is the obstetrician'. Probably. Have they seen the dingy queues, sat
for the long hours, waiting for a few moments with a consultant? As to home
confinements, 'the college's view is that this is not a safe alternative to
delivery in properly equipped surroundings'. So far as my lay mind can
discover, that view is strongly disputed, although you have to believe in
last-minute ambulance rides for cases that go life-threateningly wrong.
There is one necessary caveat. Nobody, so far as I can tell, has produced a
profit and loss table. In-hospital confinements, particularly when
operations ensue, sound more expensive than outpatient work by lowly paid
midwives. Mrs Bottomley is still mulling the Cumberlege report. Under
pressure from the obstetricians, she released it as a discussion document,
without fully endorsing it. If she decides to accept it, she should
accompany the good news with figures to show that the best possible
midwifery service is to be created, and that the exercise is not motivated
by cost-cutting alone.
That little matter aside, the government would be wise to brave the wrath of
the Royal College. Some women may prefer caesareans; some may long for
natural births. Many will want their confinements to be in hospital, under
an obstetrician's care; others will be more comfortable at home with a
midwife. All should be given the necessary medical guidance with which to
make an informed choice. What could be more 1990s Conservative than that?

Sir, More than a touch of cynicism seems to have crept into Samuel Brittan's
address. No one is seriously asking 'corporations to take on a
pseudo-governmental role' nor 'to achieve public policy objectives on the
cheap'. However, they are rightly being asked to concern themselves with
issues in society that directly affect their businesses.
For example, companies need well-educated and trained school leavers and
graduates to ensure future profitability. Should they stay shut up in their
narrow business world, wholly concentrating on making money today, as
Brittan implies, or should they enter into partnership with the public
sector and the wider community, spelling out their needs and working with
the other sectors to achieve solutions? Deep-seated problems like
educational under-achievement can only be solved if all the parties to the
solution co-ordinate their efforts.
The simple fact is, business can only prosper long term in the context of a
stable, prosperous society. Michael Tuffrey,

Sir, Samuel Brittan sees an ambiguity in the position of proponents of
'socially responsible' business. Do they claim the extra activities will
help a business's long-term profitability? Or do they assert that a business
should follow different objectives? The answer to both questions is 'yes'.
Business support for community and social causes may contribute to long-term
profit in three ways: by creating a favourable image of the company with
potential customers, setting it apart from its competitors; by improving the
motivation and productivity of its employees; and by expanding the market
for its products through fostering a stable, prosperous and well-educated
community, in however small a way. Appropriate external activities can make
business people sharper, more adaptable and less insular.
Few would see making profits as business's only responsibility. The manner
in which those profits are pursued, and the ways in which business can help
meet wider national goals, also matter, even if it is harder to define good
measures of success for them.
There is another justification for 'socially responsible' business, only
hinted at by Samuel Brittan. Skills and experience developed in business can
be usefully applied to tackling some aspects of the social problems he
mentions. the men and women in Whitehall, or in the townhall, may not always
know best.
Of course, it is wrong to expect 'corporate executives . . . to undertake a
large burden of public duties'. But it would be even more wrong not to tap
the talents of business people as part of our combined efforts to deal with
public issues that concern us all. Alastair Bruce,

<TEXT>
Sir, By raising many good questions while providing little in the way of
answers, Samuel Brittan's comments accurately reflect the current,
underdeveloped state of economic thinking on the subject of ethics.
Perhaps the reason lies in the dichotomy in western thought between the
'self' and 'others'. Economic theory is based on the premise that people act
in their own self-interest, the 'self' is implicitly understood to mean the
individual or, at a stretch, the family unit. Sacrificial acts done for the
sake of 'others' are viewed as an anomaly. To fit such acts into their
theoretical framework, economists must rationalise them as bringing a sort
of perverse satisfaction to the doer.
Brittan concludes that economics needs to be expanded to take account of
values. I would suggest a more metaphysical approach: expand, through
education, peoples' consciousness of 'self' so that it embraces not only
their individual being but their community, nation, the world, and
ultimately the whole creation.
Manufacturers that felt no sense of separation from the environment would
baulk at the thought of polluting the air or water to cut costs. Citizens of
rich nations who felt at one with poorer peoples of the world would find it
much easier to mobilise the resources needed to eradicate famine and
disease. In essence, expanding our awareness of 'self' would not invalidate
economic theory, but it would dramatically change the choices we make as
individuals and societies.
Of course, there are serious obstacles to achieving this. Our educational
system would need to be rebuilt around a core set of moral and spiritual
precepts. Gaining consensus on the content of this set would be a monumental
task. But here, the economists can help. In the 1960s, the work of Theodore
Schultz and Gary Becker on investment in education and training altered the
attitudes of policymakers worldwide towards the importance of 'human
capital'. Similarly, if today's economists were able empirically to link
economic advancement to factors like family values, sense of community,
trust, and integrity among leaders, our policymakers might invest more
aggressively in society's stock of 'spiritual capital'.

Sir, Samuel Brittan is out of touch with the times if he thinks business and
the community should keep their distance. In the Co-operative Bank (and
movement) we have a natural relationship going back a century and a half
with the community which created us, but today most businesses are
rediscovering ethical and community values.
There has been a distance between business and local activists which needed
to be bridged. Now, for example, we - and many other local businesses - are
working with Manchester and neighbouring authorities, supported by the prime
minister, to bring the Olympics to the north-west and new prosperity to east
Manchester. Through that, we are all learning how much more we can achieve
working together for the community and for our businesses.
Economists say that in the long run ethical businesses prosper. Few of
Britain's biggest and best businesses today would not claim to be part of
their communities. It is not a fashion - it is the long-term recipe for
success.

Sir, Samuel Brittan seems to assume that corporate responsibility is about
deciding how to divide up the cake, and concludes that the shareholders will
win any tug-of-war with the community over how profits are divided.
Socially responsible behaviour by business managers is not about managing
the tug-of-war. It is about finding ways of managing the productive
activities of the business so that a greater contribution can be made to the
community without diminishing productivity or competitiveness. Being
socially responsible requires creativity and entrepreneurial flair, not
charity.
Corporate responsibility is about business purpose. A management team
wanting to create a 'responsible' corporation is unlikely to have
'maximising shareholder value' as its business purpose. Like Sainsbury's
primary objective 'to discharge the responsibility as leaders in our trade'
or Body Shop's desire to promote cosmetics that are not tested on animals,
responsible corporations are likely to have responsible purposes.
Brittan confuses objectives and constraints. He assumes that long-term
profitability is an objective and accuses proponents of corporate
responsibility of a 'systematic ambiguity'. He fails to recognise that all
businesses, whatever purpose they choose, must create value for their active
stakeholders - shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers. Long-term
profitability is normally a central part of creating this value, but it is
not the objective. The need to create value is a constraint not a purpose.

When Samuel Brittan told the British Association ('Social tasks of
business', September 2) that there is a 'systematic ambiguity' in the
arguments for corporate responsibility, he missed a vital point.
Business in the Community has always agreed that the primary role of
business is to create sustainable wealth by meeting customers' needs. We
differ from Brittan in our belief that, by working in the wider community,
business can help to build the social environment it needs for long-term
wealth creation.
As unemployment rises the demand for goods contracts, and as crime rates
soar the costs of security improvements and insurance premiums grow. So
there are sound business reasons behind Unipart's project with government,
police, magistrates and Oxford companies to combat car crime by training
young offenders to tune up old cars and giving them the chance to race them.
Similarly, business needs well-educated and highly skilled people to succeed
in more competitive global markets. That is why companies are playing a more
active role in education and training by, for example, training teachers in
skills like financial management and marketing and by giving young people
quality work experience placements.
There is clear evidence that customers increasingly expect businesses to
play their part in tackling social issues; in 1992, Mori research found that
73 per cent of adults are more inclined to buy products from companies that
support the community and society.
At the same time, companies are choosing community involvement as a way to
meet business needs for staff development and training, marketing, and
building positive relationships with employees, customers, shareholders and
local communities.
For instance, Marks and Spencer sends high-flyers to work for community
organisations to broaden their experience and test their leadership
potential; Grand Metropolitan encourages employees to get involved in
community projects to build teams, motivation and morale; and Whitbread
builds links with schools to enhance its local profile and position itself
as an attractive employer.
A survey by MSS of the UK's top 1,000 companies found that 75 per cent
believe that employee involvement in the community improves morale, 71 per
cent that it builds teams and 65 per cent that it offers training
opportunities. Employees are even more enthusiastic - 84 per cent told Mori
that a company that supports society and the community is probably a good
company to work for.
Samuel Brittan argued that corporate responsibility attempts to achieve
public policy objectives 'on the cheap'. Our view is simply that business
has legitimate interests in public policy matters.
Social priorities like protecting the environment, raising the quality of
education and regenerating local communities call for participation by all
partners in society - seen in relatively recent partnerships like Training
and Enterprise Councils and City Challenges. This is not about business
replacing government, but 'adding value' by bringing its own skills,
attitudes and resources to the public policy table.
Brittan said that 'several' business leaders are associated with Business in
the Community. If that includes the leaders of Business in the Community's
470 member companies, the 6,000 leaders of companies who support small
businesses through local enterprise agencies and the tens of thousands of
executives who get involved with schools, then we are happy to be among the
'several'.

<TEXT>
Sir, Of what is Prof John Broome a professor? Capitalism does not, as he
asserts ('Morality of greed and nepotism', September 11/12), reward either
talent, or hard work, glibness or goodness. It rewards only risk, daringly
courted and successfully overcome. This is not mere captiousness. Unless we
can create a wider understanding of how the wealth which we all need for our
living is really created, then academic degrees and high morality
notwithstanding, we shall simply destroy each other over an inexorably
dwindling pool of resources.
I know you understand this, sir; but how many more professors are there out
there?

<TEXT>
Sir, Your headline, 'Many killed in US attack on Somalis' (September 10)
follows the rest of the English press in yet another slur against the US.
Had a Royal Air Force helicopter been involved, would the headline refer to
a 'UK attack' on Somalis?
Perhaps in that case you would be more inclined to an even-handed 'UN
attack' or heroic 'UK rescue of UN troops'.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: British role in Bolivia's lost sea
link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP WHITELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I loved Christina Lamb's description of the Bolivian navy ('Despatches:
The navy lark', September 11/12), but what a shame she doesn't know the
story behind the disappearance of the country from Victorian maps and the
British collusion with Chile to rob Bolivia of its access to the sea.
The problem began with an unfortunate decision by Bolivia's humorous but
mentally ill president of the 1860s, Mariano Melgarejo. He decided to punish
the British ambassador for having the temerity to say that he didn't much
care for the qualities of chicha (part-fermented wine: a South American
favourite of the period). His punishment was to drink an entire barrel of
chocolate and then be led, facing backwards, astride a donkey through the
main street of La Paz. He was sent back to London.
In response, Queen Victoria reputedly asked for a map of South America, drew
a cross in chalk through Bolivia, and declared furiously: 'Bolivia doesn't
exist.'
Britain was, in fact, the real victor of the War of the Pacific, for while
Chile gained the territory, a convenient coup prevented President Balmaceda
from nationalising the nitrate mining concerns, which remained under the
control of the Liverpool Nitrate Company.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Breaking the Bank - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise and fall of John Law (1671-1729) convict, international financier
and speculator is perfect matter for a play, serious, funny or both. Eleanor
Zeal's Breaking the Bank by the Empty Space Theatre Company at The
Warehouse, Croydon tells of Law's career, and amounts to a fine idea gone
astray, nearly right, but just, as Law might say, one share short of a
portfolio.
The remarkable Law was a fine gambler whose luck ran out when he killed a
man in a duel in 1694. He broke jail and spent the 1690s learning about
credit systems in Amsterdam and Genoa. His dream was paper currency. He
floated the idea at the Scottish parliament, was turned down, and instead
set up a private bank in Paris. There his ideas gained currency and his
currency gained him a job from the French Regent as comptroller-general of
finance in France. He set up the French equivalent of the South Sea Bubble
by forming the Mississippi trading company in 1719.
How does Breaking the Bank do justice to Law's life and achievements? It
tries, but fails. The best parts of this costume-drama look like cabaret
sketches about money, notes, shares and speculation. There are fugues, sung
by the four actors: 'Keep the money moving' or 'We're going to deal in
futures, in castles in the air.' There are jokes about privatisation, new
taxes on fuel, and references to the European Monetary System, having a
flutter down at the Bourse. But fortunately the wit never plumbs the lost
consonant depths of 'Gentlemen prefer bonds.'
The characters and the action are bitty. The Regent (Philippe of Orleans,
played by Adam Fahey) opens with 'I didn't poison Louis.' Opposite him, Law
(Luke Williams) and his quasi-wife Catherine (Jaquie Bywaters) are an
up-tight Protestant voice in a Xenophobic Catholics system running on divine
credit. Richard Cherry as coachman and bankers makes up the energetic cast,
who bustle round an inventive set of cube boxes. Andrew Holmes' direction
could be smoother, and the play should be shorter.
Law wrote in Money and Trade Considered (1705): 'Wealth depends upon
commerce, and commerce depends upon circulation.' Somehow 'The Circulation
of Nations' does not ring true, but he was 70 years ahead of Adam Smith.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Figuring out Freud - William Packer hails a great
British artist in his 71st year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucian Freud is without question a great artist, as remarkable as any that
this or any country has produced in a hundred years or more, as great a
painter of the figure as any since Courbet. Among his contemporaries he
stands all but alone. Whom could we put alongside him, now that Bacon is
dead? Balthus perhaps, but him only. It is a large claim to make but, in the
face of the work, inescapeable: yet even now one senses that there are many
who would deny the obvious.
It would seem two forces are at work in this respect, contradictory yet
oddly pulling in the same direction. On the one hand there is the reluctance
to overstate a case made cheap by promiscuous indulgence elsewhere: on the
other, a myopic critical disregard, born of the artist's own singularity; an
instinctive outsider, his work is awkward, difficult, entirely independent
of market fashion and modernist orthodoxy.
Certainly his current reputation has been won with little help from the
international art establishment. The Arts Council gave him his first full
retrospective at the Hayward in 1974, but I remember it as being given
somewhat against the grain - almost apologetic a special case. A second
Hayward retrospective in 1987 was more confidently given - and received - at
home, but the British Council had considerable difficulty in placing the
subsequent tour abroad, which was refused outright by New York and received
with marked indifference in Paris. And here was an artist by now in his 60s
and working with more power and authority than ever. The Tate has yet to
give him a show. In short, what consistent support he has had has come not
from the public but from the private sector.
Has this all now changed, now that Freud is 70 and a Grand Old Man? The
point is only that such critical acceptance as he now enjoys has been forced
and won by the work itself, just as it is. Like it or not, take it or leave
it, there it is - and it is not going to go away.
For its showing in New York and Madrid this exhibition will have a
retrospective element, a quick skim though from the 1940s to the early
1980s. But in London it begins in 1982, with a portrait of the artist's
mother, and so continues with portraits, figure and life-paintings large and
small, most especially the life-paintings, up to the large, full-length,
full-frontal nude self-portrait that is still in progress.
It is the record of a decade of phenomenal personal achievement, although
for an artist to continue in full creative flow well into old age is not
unusual. Indeed, with such artists as Titian or Rembrandt or Monet, it is
possible to argue that the best comes last. With Freud, however, such has
been the creative drive since the late 1970s it is as though he has waited
until then almost to begin. At that point it seems he came to his proper
subject, the human presence in a particular space, usually nude, which he
had treated often enough before but now fixed upon all but exclusively. And
with it came, for him, its proper treatment - an unremiting scrutiny - and
its proper scale - moving up to life-size.
It is strong stuff and even shocking if taken superficially, but then we
forget that great painting in the post-Renaissance humane tradition always
had the power to shock, and used this power quite deliberately. And it is to
this greater tradition that Freud belongs, which is perhaps where the
critical difficulty lies. He is a modern painter, working in modern times,
fully aware of all that modernism, and expressionism in particular, has made
available to the artist in our secular age. But while Freud would never deny
the modern movement, he is not, has never been, its creature.
In another time who is to say what martyrdoms and mysteries he might have
painted. We think of Titian, Caravaggio, Ribera, Goya - Marsyas flayed, St
Lawrence twisting on his grill, St Anthony tormented in the wilderness.
Autres temps, autres moeurs: and what we have from Freud instead of saints
personified is the image direct of the human condition and, at the closest
remove, of our own mortality. Such a subject is only as shocking as we wish
it to be.
Which leaves the paintings as paintings - for it is all too easy to become
so fixed on the imagery, especially such strong meat as this, as to see
nothing else. There is always more to the understanding of painting than the
mere literary reading of metaphor or symbol. Here are these nudes, legs
splayed, arms akimbo, the portrait heads staring fixedly before them, the
figures set in the bleak physical space of the artist's studio, and all
subject to that same searching, apparently unsentimental gaze. And yet the
most physical thing about them is not the imagery at all but the paint
itself, rich and dense. What we find as we look into these surfaces is that
Freud is become ever freer in his handling, and taking more and more risks
with drawing and proportion - a huge foot, a strange passage of modelling, a
squashed face. For here is no close, tortured preoccupation with
verisimilitude but a practical ebullience and, yes, enjoyment, that is not
quite what we might have expected.
Freud is now clearly working at high speed, and yet all is carried through
with such command and technical aplomb that no whit nor jot of it is
anything less than utterly convincing. We accept what Freud shows us as
being true enough, but the truth is what Freud has made it to be, no pale
copy or simulacrum of reality but a true equivalent, born of the creative
imagination. And it is also very beautiful. What ugliness there is lies in
ourselves.

<TEXT>
The Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh has a high profile during the three
weeks of the city's festival - and then suddenly shrinks back to merely
local significance. A pity, for its old auditorium is handsome, its stage
well-equipped and its foyer space (expanded two years ago) attractive.
The theatre's reputation, however, may be starting to rise. Its recently
appointed artistic director, Kenny Ireland, has just launched the 1993-94
season with a deft, traditional, funny staging of Farquhar's The Recruiting
Officer. The season will include Maureen Lipman directing The Sunshine Boys,
Brian Cox acting in The Master Builder, Bill Paterson in Bulgakov's A
Mongrel's Heart, and Ireland's stagings of A Midsummer Night's Dream and
Oedipus Tyrannos.
Ireland keeps A Recruting Officer light and vivid. I came to it straight
from watching the movie of Much Ado, and could not help noting how much
smaller Farquhar's comic world is than Shakespeare's, how much narrower his
tone. The trick of Restoration comedy is to make its tight little world real
and brilliant. Ireland gives his actors enough period sense to make it real
and he differentiates each character sharply while giving them all vigour.
Brilliance is only fully present in one impersonation - Bob Barrett's
playing of Captain Brazen. Brazen, a secondary role, is all irrepressible
presumption and namedropping cocksureness; and Barrett bursts onto the stage
with such fruity big-voiced glee, such silly round-faced panache, that he
almost unbalances the play. But not quite. As Silvia, Jules Melvin brings
off the feat of acting en travesti with convincing style; and Rebecca
Charles, playing Melinda as a pettish spoilt parlour pug, grows endearingly
vulnerable as the play proceeds. As Plume, Phelim Drew has energy, manner,
but not enough refinement; as Worthy, Patrick Toomey has refinement but not
enough energy.
The strength of the production owes much to Russell Craig's designs, which
use the revolving stage to create several different interior and exterior
scenes economically but surely; and a dozen extras swell the crowd scenes to
fine effect. Ireland allows his cast to misinterpret some small points but
at all points the play keeps up brisk pace, colourful characterisation, and
high spirits.

A full and promising evening. The Oxford Dictionary Of Opera says that in
Act 4 of Prokofiev's work The Fiery Angel 'Rupprecht watches Mephistopheles
angrily devour a slow-moving serving boy and then resurrect him from a
nearby rubbish dump. He joins the party'. Who wouldn't. BBC2 relays the
opera from the Maryinsky Theatre, St Petersburg. Written in the Twenties,
set against a background of religious hysteria in 16th century Germany, and
banned by the Soviet regime, it was finally staged in 1955 (7.00).
BBC1 screens the second documentary in The Skipper, about Cornishman Roger
Nowell, 'fisherman and modern day buccaneer' (8.00). Channel 4 shows the
second of its series DW Griffith: Father Of Film, about the man who made
'Intolerance' (9.00). Both began well.
Today's film in BBC2's 10 x 10 showcase is 'The Sixth Continent' about the
Channel Tunnel and Romney Marsh (10.20). Alan Whicker has always had an eye
for attractive women, money, and vulgarity. Whicker's Miss World in South
Africa seems to have the lot (10.40 ITV).

FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Tribute to Sir Geraint - Gala Concert in Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few opera-lovers today can recall opera before Geraint Evans. For many of
us, he was already part of the firmament when we discovered opera. It is
therefore good to know that his name continues in the present tense in the
Geraint Evans Scholarship Fund, which has supported young singers at the
Welsh College of Music and Drama since shortly before his death in 1992. On
Sunday, in St David's Hall, Cardiff, a number of celebrated Welsh singers
joined a gala chorus, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and conductor
David Pryce-Jones for 'A Gala Tribute to Sir Geraint,' a concert whose
proceeds will benefit this fund.
Every good gala should have its surprise; this once had an unknown Verdi
aria. Dennis O'Neill, who has sung Foresto in Verdi's Attila at Covent
Garden, introduced an alternative aria that in 1846 Verdi wrote, at
Rossini's request, for the tenor Ivanoff to sing. The aria, 'Sventurato]
Della mia vita', was never published; O'Neill is the first since Ivanoff to
sing it. He sings it well, and it deserves to become better known.
Everything about it says, splendidly, 'Verdi' - the mixture of legato and
staccati in the arching vocal lines; the staccati triplets that quietly,
feelingly, accompany the initial phrases; the woodwind that join in and link
it to the particular sound-world of Attila's more lyrical scenes; the
orchestral tutti that join its swelling climax; the muted orchestral close
straight after the tenor's final high note.
In case we needed reminding, the gala demonstrated the strength of Welsh
singing. O'Neill, who planned and organised the gala, also sang Lensky's
aria from Eugene Onegin with elegiac beauty, and joined Margaret Price in
the love-duet from Verdi's Otello. Price, whose pure entry into notes
remains phenomenal, later sang Desdemona's Willow Song and Ave Maria, making
every phrase, every word, count. I love the way she makes the first calls of
'Salce]' sound like a distant voice, and how she matches her phrasing here
to the oboe.
Della Jones, fresh from her Proms appearance the previous night, sang the
rondo finale from Rossini's Cenerentola with sparkling aplomb. True, her
divisions and top notes are not as breathtakingly clean as they were 10 or
15 years ago, but this is still a wonderfully exciting account of this
irresistible scene (here given with a little joke cadenza referring to the
gala's previous aria, 'Non piu andrai'). I have space only to mention and
praise the contributions of Gwynne Howell (in music from Onegin and Don
Carlo), Arthur Davies (fresh from the Covent Garden opening-night Butterfly,
singing the Carmen Flower Song), Jason Howard (in Posa's death scene from
Don Carlo) and Rebecca Evans (in Susanna's aria from Figaro).
Most glorious of them all, Bryn Terfel. When Caruso heard Lotte Lehmann, he
complimented her by saying 'Brava - una vera voce voce italiana': which
leaps to my mind as I hear Terfel today. His baritone, so secure, is placed
that you hear his whole body and face in every phrase; he has spontaneity,
virility, force, individuality. He sang 'Non piu andrai' from Figaro, and
the Honour monologue from Verdi's Falstaff - both Geraint Evans roles, both
here given immense panache. Yes, in the latter opera he has been singing
Ford (and only the night before in Cardiff); he has already all the
eloquence for Falstaff.
It was a smart touch to end each half of the gala with a big ensemble. The
sextet from Donizetti's Lucia preceded the interval; but it was effaced by
the great fugue from Falstaff, which brought together all the evening's
soloists: Margaret Price as Alice, Della Jones as Meg, and so on. The
intricacy of Verdi's writing, and the bubbling glee with which his music is
shot through, have seldom been more apparent.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Schreier's 'Liederabend' delights - Weekend music in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wigmore Hall season of 'Master Concerts' began on Saturday with a
Liederabend by Peter Schreier, received with respectful delight. In the
Austro-German song repertoire he is, I suppose, the premier tenor of our
day; given his austerely idealised notion of how Lieder should be sung, he
has no peer, and few competitors. Between thrusting tenors with larynxes
focussed upon opera, and sensitive artists - mostly British - with white-ish
voices on the Pears model, sincere intentions and stilted German, the middle
ground is under-populated.
Except for Josef Protschka and perhaps Laurence Dale, no younger tenors
stand out just now in Lieder. Since the cruelly premature death of Fritz
Wunderlich (at 36, in a trivial accident), there has been no comparable
tenor to match him, not with the kind of voice Schubert must have had in
mind for his Schone Mullerin: lightly natural, expressive and heartfelt,
with no need for strenuous Italian top-notes.
If Schreier is not exactly that kind of tenor, in his particular way he is
the Compleat Artist. There used to be jokes about his surname (meaning
'screamer', as in 'Your baby is a real Schreier, isn't he]') that were quite
off the mark - except for his upper register, which sometimes strikes my ear
as uncomfortably tight and overwrought, perhaps because he controls it so
strictly to keep it in line with his easier middle-voice. He cultivates a
seamless legato, for with him the line is the essential thing, most
delicately and scrupulously inflected.
Vocal colour-effects probably strike him as vulgar in the great Lieder, and
he eschews them. In this recital he allowed himself just the odd moment of
audible theatre; otherwise his tone was consistently bright, forthright,
unassuming, without much depth. His diction is immaculate and he is no less
searching with the texts than Schubert himself, or even Hugo Wolf.
Everything has been thought out and polished to the hilt. There is a sense
that precious objects are being reverently displayed.
Not that there is anything remotely pretentious in Schreier's platform
manner: on the contrary, he is the very image of the affable, sympathetic
bank manager you never had. At the Wigmore this time he sang Schubert and
Brahms, including some of the latter's late, lusty 'folk songs'; a
last-minute decision to reverse the two halves of the programme was a good
idea, for then the 'folk songs' laced his recital with a deceptively
relaxed, informal air from the outset. All the rest of his 'serious' Brahms
was exquisitely shaped and shaded, further enhanced by Graham Johnson's
searching accompaniments.
So also Schreier's Schubert - and Johnson's. I think the latter has learned
to be an unintrusive but genuinely inspired Schubert accompanist in the
course of his monumental recording project (the complete Schubert songs with
the best Schubert singers, on Hyperion CDs). 'Ganymed', on one of Goethe's
most erotically subversive poems, was a marvel of subtle, suggestive tact.
In his 'Uber allen Gipfeln', and in Ruckert's 'Du bist die Ruh', the singer
underlined the lofty contours so that we could not miss them. Simpler might
have been better  - but Schreier is a long way beyond that now, and he is an
artist of rare distinction.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: The right rules supreme - America's
highest court was dominated by conservatives in the '92-93 term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A review of the voting patterns of the US Supreme Court over the 1992-93
legal term shows America's highest court still dominated by the
conservatives.
According to the National Law Journal, a US legal magazine, at the opening
of the 1992-93 term in October last year the main question was whether three
centrist justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Anthony Kennedy and
Justice David Souter, would continue to act as a moderating influence on the
court's more extreme left and right-wing elements, as they had done in the
previous term.
By the end of the term in July it was clear that they had not. Looking at
the court's decisions during the term, on civil rights, church-state
separation and voting rights, it was apparent that Justices O'Connor and
Kennedy at least had returned to the conservative fold, the magazine says.
Evidence of the renewed domination of the right was most apparent in the 20
decisions in which the court was split five-four. Most often in the majority
in those cases was the staunch conservative, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, followed by Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
Least often in the majority in five-four splits was Justice Souter. This
pattern was a reversal of the 1991-92 term.
Justice Thomas followed the approach he took in his first year on the
Supreme Court bench, agreeing most often with Justice Scalia - in 91 per
cent of all cases.
Overall, the National Law Journal says, the last term's 118 decisions
demonstrated that the court's seven conservative members often had competing
visions of conservatism. Nevertheless, there was a high degree of unanimity.
The justices were unanimous in 43 per cent of cases, continuing an upward
trend in unanimous decisions which began in 1989-90.
In the commercial sphere, for the second year running business won important
victories in the high court, enjoying success in anti-trust, employment
discrimination and federal taxation cases.
But in two of the term's most significant decisions, business suffered big
defeats. In TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp and Daubert v
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc, the court respectively rejected attempts to
curb juries' awards of large punitive damages, and gave federal judges
broader discretion to admit novel scientific theories that may not be
generally accepted.
The TXO decision was a big blow for industry, which for years has been
fighting punitive damages awards many times the size of compensatory
damages. The National Law Journal predicts that the court's decision in TXO
will increase pressure from business for legislative caps on punitive
awards.
Upholding a punitive damages award 526 times the size of the compensatory
award not only handed the reformers a piece of propaganda, the magazine
says, it also allowed the press to hold up the decision as 'an example of a
judiciary that has lost its collective mind'.
In the anti-trust field, the most important decision came in Hartford Fire
Insurance v California and Merrett Underwriting Agency v California. The
court, in two five-four opinions, allowed an anti-trust suit brought by 19
US states against four insurance companies and their UK reinsurers at
Lloyd's to go to trial in the federal court, and held that insurers did not
lose their anti-trust immunity by collaborating with foreign insurers.
The big issue for the next term, beginning next month, will be where the
court's newest member, Justice Ruth Ginsburg, fits into the picture. The
first Democratic appointment to the Supreme Court for 26 years, she was
billed by the Clinton administration as a moderate centrist.
But Justice Ginsburg has an activist record and many legal observers feel
she is not naturally aligned with the moderate conservatives of the court
and is likely to be more left of centre. Some predict that a quartet may
emerge in the centre ground - Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and
Ginsburg - but only on occasions.
The National Law Journal predicts the most visible result of the replacement
of the centre/right Justice Byron White, retiring after 31 years, with the
centre/left Justice Ginsburg is likely to come on abortion rights. Justice
White was consistently against the court's 1973 landmark abortion rights
ruling, Roe v Wade.
The court has accepted a number of cases for next term that should soon
reflect the influence Justice Ginsburg will have. They include cases on
voting rights, the retroactive impact of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, sex
discrimination in jury selection, federal anti-racketeering laws, abortion
clinic blockades, child pornography and sexual harassment.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Stop-press allegations - Robert Rice
on The Independent's OFT complaint against The Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's newspaper price war is hotting up. Last Friday, Newspaper
Publishing, owner of the struggling Independent, formally complained to the
Office of Fair Trading that News International was trying to squeeze it out
of the market by cutting the price of its loss-making flagship, The Times,
by 15p.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor in chief of The Independent, accused The
Times of predatory pricing - deliberately lowering prices to uneconomic
levels in the short term with the intention of eliminating competition, and
so enhancing profits in the long term.
The Times rejected the allegation. The move was in the interests of the
industry as a whole and had already resulted in an increase in the size of
the quality broadsheet market, it said.
It claimed that a similar expansion of the market had followed News
International's price cut for The Sun in July, giving it a 7p advantage over
its rival the Daily Mirror. The Sun's circulation has risen by 300,000
copies to 3.38m a day. But the Mirror's circulation is also increasing,
rising by 63,000 during August.
Although the 30p Times is only a week old, early signs are that News
International may be right. The Times's circulation is up - some newspaper
wholesalers say by as much as 40 per cent - but not at the expense of its
rivals. Overall, the quality broadsheet market appears to have increased by
about 3 per cent. Even The Independent concedes that a survey of 1,000
outlets showed its circulation had risen by 2-3 per cent, making its
complaint to the OFT more puzzling.
However, it is early days, and on the surface there appears to be a good
case for an OFT investigation. The OFT says it will look at The
Independent's submission before deciding whether or not to launch a formal
investigation under the 1980 Competition Act. Sir Gordon Borrie, former
director-general of fair trading and now a non-executive director of Mirror
Group Newspapers, believes it should.
'I think there is a prima facie case to answer. It is difficult to see what
the point is apart from trying to see off The Independent. I can't imagine
them being able to demonstrate to the OFT that The Times is viable at 30p.'
But Sir Gordon warned that establishing predation would be difficult. The
problem is that it is difficult to decide precisely at what point desirable
price competition ends and predatory pricing begins, and even harder to
establish predation in any particular case.
There have been several attempts to frame an economic test of when a price
is predatory, the most well-known being that of the Americans Areeda and
Turner.
They argued that a price should be deemed predatory and therefore unlawful
under US law where it was less than a company's average variable cost, and
presumed lawful where it was above average variable cost - average variable
cost being calculated by dividing costs that vary according to output, such
as raw materials and labour, by actual output.
This strict cost/price analysis poses significant problems for competition
authorities in establishing a company's average variable cost. The test has
also been criticised as being too narrow, some economists arguing that
pricing above average variable cost can still be predatory, particularly
where there is a clear intention to eliminate competition and where that is
the practical result. Not all US courts have followed the Areeda/Turner
test.
In the UK the OFT has only carried out seven formal investigations of
alleged predatory pricing since the Competition Act came into force, most
recently finding two local bus companies, Southdown Motor Services and
Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services, guilty of predation.
The best indication as to the approach the OFT might take comes from the
1988 Becton Dickinson case, where Sir Gordon cleared Becton Dickinson, a
medical equipment maker, of selling hypodermic syringes and needles at
predatory prices. But in doing so, he set out three criteria for deciding
whether a price was predatory. It was necessary to look at the relationship
between costs and prices, the structure and characteristics of the market,
and for intent on the part of the predator, he said.
This test is wider than the straight cost/price analysis of the Americans.
It involves consideration of a number of issues: whether the predation is
likely to succeed; the strength of the predator's position in the market;
its ability to sustain losses in one market by cross-subsidisation from
other markets; and any barriers to market entry once the predator has
restored its price to its normal level.
Since then, however, there has been a change at the top of the OFT and
perhaps more importantly a significant decision in Europe in the Akzo case
in 1991, which might influence the OFT's approach to The Times case.
The European Commission found Akzo, the Dutch company, guilty of abuse of
its dominant position, but rejected the Areeda/Turner approach. The
Commission said cost/price analysis was one element in deciding whether a
price was predatory, but it was also important to look at whether the
dominant company had a strategy of eliminating competition and what the
likely effects of its conduct were.
On appeal the European Court upheld the Commission's approach. The Court
said that where a price was below average variable cost it would be presumed
predatory, but when prices were above average variable cost but below
average total cost (the total of variable and fixed costs of a company
divided by actual output) the company could still be guilty of predation if
the prices were fixed in the context of a strategy aimed at eliminating a
competitor.
The OFT is likely to face considerable difficulty in assessing costs at The
Times, not least because of the complicating factor introduced by the
advertising side of the business.
However, Sir Gordon believes there may be a more simple obstacle to
establishing predation - the difficulty of proving an intention to put The
Independent out of business. 'I don't suppose there will be too many office
memos lying about the place,' he says.
Others agree, but also point to further difficulties. Mr Derek Ridyard, of
National Economic Research Associates, says that, although it is not a legal
requirement in the UK, the OFT would normally be looking for some evidence
of dominance in the market.
It is not obvious that News International is dominant, he says, although
there might be an argument that it is using its strength in the Sunday
quality market to gain an advantage in the daily market, particularly if the
price cut has an indirect effect on the viability of the Independent on
Sunday.
Given the quantity and complexity of the issues faced by the OFT, a quick
decision looks unlikely. Sir Gordon believes the OFT may wait until the
effect of The Times price cut becomes clearer.
If News International is right and the result of the price cut is to
increase the overall size of the quality daily market, then an investigation
would be superfluous. If, on the other hand, the price cut begins to eat
into The Independent's sales, the damage may well have been done by the time
it takes to complete an investigation.

FT  14 SEP 93 / People: Citibank loses researchers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Partridge-Hicks and Nicholas Sossidis have resigned from the
research group of Citibank following a dispute over pay, funding and control
of the operations with which they were connected.
The two men were the business managers responsible for Alpha and Beta
Finance Corporations, two entities that invested in high quality rated debt
securities.
Citibank said yesterday the resignation was due to 'a fundamental
disagreement on the amount of future resources to be made available to the
research group and the relative ownership of the management activity between
the parties'.
Alan Harley, a vice president, said the resignation would have little
adverse impact and that while the two men were the 'figureheads' there were
another 18 people who worked in the group. 'We continue as normal,' he said.
Charles Covell has been appointed as new manager of the Research Group,
which Citibank said would be 'fully resourced for growth'.
Partridge-Hicks and Sossidis said they intended to develop a new investment
management business with a joint venture partner, drawing on their
experience with Citibank over the last six years. They said the management
team would be tied-in with the 'appropriate contracts and financial
incentives . . . so often requested by investors'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Palmer, the ex-global strategist who is building a Latin American
equities team at Kleinwort Benson, has hired four people whom he believes
share the relatively rare qualities of technical expertise in the region
with an understanding of the UK investment banking scene.
His new deputy and head of sales, 28-year-old Andrew Macdonald, has spent
nearly five years at Baring Secur-ities, which has established itself as the
leading UK house in Latin America, even if it has been hit recently by a
wave of defections.
Palmer, who has decided to differentiate his service by basing his team in
London, as opposed to New York or Mexico, and taking a sector, as well as
country, approach to equity analysis, has also gone for two
internationally-minded Latin Americans.
Argentinian born Andrea Marmolejo, 31, who will head the research team, is a
Harvard graduate and has worked at the Argentine central bank, McKinsey and
the then UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. She answered an advertisement for her new job
after spending a short while at a Spanish-funded venture capital operation.
After the bank's success with the last Chilean it picked from the London
Business School MBA programme, who is now doing well in the Latin American
corporate finance department of KB, Palmer returned to the LBS, and hired
the only final year MBA student who came from Chile. He is Sergio Arredondo,
who is 29.
Janet Krengel, 40, senior Latin American economist from Lloyds Bank, has
also just come aboard.
In a region where relationships are crucial in winning business, KB is
already well-connected. Sir Kenneth Kleinwort, who remains a non-executive
director of the group, has an Argentinian wife, and Desmond Cameron, the
head of the Latin American corporate finance team which has been
successfully collecting Argentinian privatisation mandates, looks back on 30
years experience.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Technology: Doubts about digital television - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS GOODALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people see the word 'digital' and assume it represents an improvement
over an existing analogue technology. So the interested - but non-technical
 -observer might applaud the Independent Television Commission's (ITC)
strong expressions of interest in the digital transmission of broadcast TV
signals.
In the case of the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, however, the general view would
probably be wrong.
Before we pursue the digital route, we need to ask some questions about what
such a radically new transmission system will do for viewers and
broadcasters.
The existing analogue technology is very good at transmitting the signal
accurately; modern TV receivers deliver very high-quality sound and
pictures. They are also highly reliable. Digital TV would improve these
qualities very little, if at all.
In the long run, digital transmission would allow broadcasters to cram many
more channels into the frequencies currently allocated to terrestrial
broadcasters. But getting these extra channels will require a costly and
complicated migration from the current transmission system to the new one.
The cost of digital sets will probably always be higher than analogue
receivers, which have simpler electronics and almost half a century of
manufacturing experience behind them.
There is an even greater problem caused by the extraordinary difficulty of
making the changeover. All the TV sets in the UK are incompatible with a
digital transmission technology. Until they have been replaced, or
supplemented by digital equipment, broadcasters will have to simulcast both
digital and analogue signals, using more radio spectrum capacity, not less.
Moreover, to simulcast all four terrestrial channels, broadcasters will
probably have to use channels reserved for video cassette recorders. Large
number of VCRs will have to be retuned. Thames Television, in its failed bid
for the fifth television channel, estimated the cost of this across the UK
would exceed Pounds 75m. Who will pay?
The ITC admits the only incentive is the prospect of more channels. But for
less money, consumers can already receive large numbers of extra channels
via satellite. If many more channels are wanted - and the evidence is that
no more than 40-50 per cent of households do - the best way to supply them
is via satellite services.
Digital satellite services, offering large numbers of new channels to dish
owners and to cable subscribers, will be available much sooner than digital
channels from ground-based transmitters. Similarly, new cable technologies,
which allow the carriage of 150 or more channels on cable systems already in
use in the US, will provide choice that will never be available via
over-the-air TV.
The ITC should explain why it feels able to contemplate the use of new
channels for simulcasting, when it insists that the proposed fifth
terrestrial channel is allocated to the frequencies reserved for VCRs.
A new channel, available to everybody in 1994-95, is a much better
proposition than the vague prospect of digital services in the first decade
of the next century requiring every home to buy a new TV set at a cost of
about Pounds 800.
The ITC's document on digital transmission is a measured and cautious piece
of advocacy, but it still falls into the trap of thinking that advances in
feasible technology translate rapidly into opportunities for commercial
enterprises. The last time the ITC tried to push a new technology, it
licensed the technically advanced British Satellite Broadcasting, only to
see it fail within a few years.
Before the ITC makes any decision on digital transmission, it should ask the
leading electronic retailers how many Pounds 800 TV sets they would sell if
the TVs had essentially the same features as those selling at Pounds 400.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Technology: Meaty questions on the menu - How is food
affected by irradiation? Della Bradshaw looks at a debate that is turning
into a trade issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thought of eating beef full of hormones, genetically-altered vegetables
or seafood dosed with radiation is viewed by many consumers with horror. But
while the consumers' eye is focused on nutritional quality, the food
industry sees some of the latest food technologies as potential trade
issues.
On completion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, scheduled for December 15, rules will be implemented to define when
treated foods can be legally banned from a country and when such a ban would
be deemed a barrier to trade.
The aim of the new rules, according to a Gatt official, is to define a firm
scientific basis for the protection of consumer health. 'Our concern is that
the trade side has to have a scientific base.'
The test case for the new rules will probably be the continuing issue of
hormones in beef, but food irradiation, in which the products are dosed with
ionising radiation to kill microbes, looks set to provide more widespread
debate.
Over the past decade irradiation has proven a veritable battle ground for
scientists, conservationists and the fresh food lobby.
Proponents of the technology say that there are years of scientific evidence
to prove that irradiation is safe. 'There's probably more research gone into
irradiation than any other food process,' points out David Kilcast, manager
of the sensory evaluation group, at the UK's Leatherhead Food Research
Association.
'There is a massive body of scientific evidence to suggest that it's a
useful food process,' he adds.
Perhaps most significantly, many scientists believe that by killing off
bacteria, irradiation could prove a useful tool in preventing the spread of
food poisoning.
Anti-irradiation groups claim that proper research has not been done into
certain aspects of the technology, such as its effects on the vitamin
content of food, and that some of the scientific evidence is flawed. They
also point out the danger of consumers believing that irradiation enables
them to keep fresh food indefinitely, so resulting in food poisoning.
Furthermore, they question why food should need irradiation in the first
place. 'The public perception is that irradiation is only there to cover up
defects in food,' says Tony Webb, project officer at Australia's Food Policy
Alliance, which combines the interests of trade unionists, farmers and
others. 'People don't want food to hang about on shelves. They want shorter
shelf lives rather than longer ones.'
The consumer, he says, wants foods produced with fewer pesticides and
additives using high-quality farming practices and processing methods. That
frequently adds to the expense of food production.
If food producers are allowed to promote unhygienic food production and then
clean up the food with irradiation, Webb reasons, then they are undercutting
environmentally sound food practices.
'It's as direct a distortion of trade as government subsidies,' he argues.
'The issue is about fair trade.' Webb believes that the whole agenda should
be turned on its head.
Australia has now become the focus point for the acrimony in the food
irradiation debate, following the Australian government's decision to order
a moratorium on food irradiation in 1989. This was followed by a request to
the World Health Authority to produce the definitive scientific report on
food irradiation's effect on the nutritional value of foods.
The first draft report was published in spring 1992, but the Australian
government, which funded the report, was only allowed by the WHO to sit as
an observer in the consultation procedure. A preliminary final report was
sent to the Australian government towards the end of 1992, but with the
proviso that only the government and closely related bodies should see it.
Gae Pincus, chairperson of Australia's National Food Authority, which
advises the Australian government on issues of food safety, decided to defy
WHO rules and make the report available on a 'read only' basis for other
interested parties as part of the consultation process.
'We couldn't countenance it not being available,' says Pincus. 'Over the
past couple of months the report has been available to anyone who wants it.
The WHO has accepted that. But we will still wait for the 'final final'
report before we take action.' The 'final, final' report should be available
by the end of the year.
In its draft form, the report does not address the issues set it by the NFA,
claims Webb; namely, whether irradiation affects the safety and nutritional
value of food. 'It's a shoddy job,' he concludes.
Pincus also reports that the NFA had reservations about the report - 'some
substantive, some editorial'. Yet the scientific evidence reviewed in the
report could form the basis of an international standard on food irradiation
which would have status under Gatt.
Whatever the evidence in the final WHO report, rules on irradiation could
prove extremely difficult to define.
The area is fraught with anomalies, such as the different dosages of
radiation needed for different foods, especially in composite products. In a
meat and potato dish, for example, the potatoes could be subjected to one
level of radiation to prevent sprouting, but the meat would need a different
dose, points out Kilcast.
'We need to do tests on the eating quality of the combination product,' he
adds. 'If you apply the appropriate dose to appropriate food it's fine, as
with any food process. If not, you get the same results as if you
oven-roasted a lettuce.'
The EC is continuing to grapple with harmonisation in the light of the
single market. But with Germany banning the technology and the Netherlands
renowned as the irradiation capital of the world, the going is tough. In
between the two extremes there are numerous discrepancies.
In the UK, for example, only herbs and spices can be irradiated. In France,
on the other hand, Camembert cheese has been added to the list of foods
which can be treated, but UK law means it would be illegal to sell the
cheese in Britain.
Even for single products - in the US some chickens are irradiated, for
example - Pincus believes exporting countries would have a difficult time
pressing home their case with or without international standards. 'You could
counter by asking why they couldn't send the non-irradiated version of the
product and then get quickly into health and safety issues.
'It would raise some interesting questions,' she adds. 'It may lead to
questions about the microbiological state of the product before
irradiation.'
However, the Gatt official confirmed that if countries have rules which ban
foods for which there is an international scientific standard then 'they may
be called upon to justify them'.
Rather than import bans, Gatt suggests that clear food labelling would give
consumers a choice. Sceptics argue that labelling is unlikely to provide the
consumer with the full information, particularly if only a small proportion
of the total contents of the food - a herb, say, or a spice - has been
irradiated. In many countries such a small amount of one ingredient would
mean the product as a whole was exempt from labelling under existing rules.
It is also questionable, argues the anti-irradiation lobby, whether
restaurateurs will want to emblazon their menus with notices that their
seafood platters or chicken dishes contain irradiated produce.
'One of the problems of irradiation is the name,' says Katie Munson, senior
business analyst at the Henley Centre for Forecasting, in London, which has
carried out extensive research into food acceptability. 'People are very
suspicious of anything to do with radiation. Irradiation would have to do an
enormous PR job to become accepted. Whether it's dodgy or not doesn't
matter; it's people's reactions that matter.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A taxing time ahead -
Charles Batchelor answers queries raised by the Inland Revenue's new Pay and
File system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On quiet days accountants have been known to mull over the story of the
legendary company which has never agreed a corporation tax assessment with
the Inland Revenue since 1965 when the tax was introduced in the UK. If that
company does exist, it is in for a shock.
From the start of next month the present system of paying corporation tax is
to be replaced by one known as the Pay and File method. Out goes the present
procedure which can involve a Revenue assessment, a preliminary payment
accompanied by an appeal and final agreement on the tax liability 12 to 15
months after the year-end.
In comes a system requiring companies to assess their own liability for tax
coupled with a prompt payment of the amounts due. There will still be room
for later adjustments but the Revenue's intention is to speed up the whole
process of calculating and collecting corporation tax.
At present three-quarters of the 800,000 tax assessments issued annually are
estimated. The new system will put a greater responsibility on the company
to get the calculation of its tax liability right the first time.
Not only does Pay and File mean that the Revenue gets its money sooner. It
also frees tax inspectors to devote more time to making inquiries and
pursuing investigations, warns John Whiting, tax partner at accountants
Price Waterhouse.
Companies should enjoy the benefit of having a clearer view of their tax
affairs and will also be freed from the administrative burden of the present
system. But they may also end up paying their tax a little earlier and would
be well advised to bring their tax affairs up to date before the new system
comes into force.
Seventy per cent of the effort which goes into computing a company's tax
liability is taken up by data collection, says Richard Collier-Keywood, tax
partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Relatively minor changes to a company's
systems can lead to big savings in the work involved, he suggests.
But companies are often slow to respond to the details of tax changes and
many have still to take action, notes Joy Svasti-Salee, tax partner at KPMG
Peat Marwick.
Pay and File is only one in a series of tax changes which companies have had
to absorb in recent months. At the start of the year they had to deal with a
radical change in the VAT system to coincide with the launch of the European
single market while an unusually fat Finance Act brought in a raft of
changes in many areas.
Nor are companies the only ones to suffer. Details of a new system of
self-assessment for the unincorporated business and the self-employed are
expected in the November budget. Implementation will probably be delayed
until 1996-97 so small businesses will have a breathing space.
Q. What will be the main changes brought about by Pay and File?
A. Companies will be required to assess their own tax liability with a
greater degree of accuracy. Tax will have to be paid within nine months of
the year-end and the return submitted within 12 months of the year-end.
Q. When will the new system take effect?
A. It will apply to accounting periods ending on or after October 1 1993.
There will be no transitional arrangements.
Q. Will the new system affect the amount of tax I pay?
A. There will be no change in the way your tax liability is calculated by
the Revenue. Only the administration and payment procedures will change.
Q. Will assessments be abandoned altogether?
A. No. An assessment will be issued once the Revenue has agreed your
liability. But the number of estimated assessments should be significantly
reduced - though they may still be needed in cases of dispute. The normal
appeals procedure will continue to apply.
Q. What happens if I do not submit my return on time?
A. Automatic penalties will be levied for late filing, starting at Pounds
100 and rising to Pounds 1,000 plus 20 per cent of the unpaid tax for longer
delays and repeated failures. The penalties start low but can build up
rapidly if a company fails to keep to deadlines.
Q. What happens to the present system of charging interest if payment is
delayed?
A. Pay and File should lead to a simpler and more immediate system for
calculating interest on late payments and overpayments. Interest on tax paid
late will run automatically from the date payment was due to the actual date
of payment. The Revenue will pay interest on any over-payment you make but
at a lower rate than that charged on late payments.
Q. What should I do if I realise I have not paid enough tax?
A. It will be to your benefit to make an additional payment immediately to
avoid interest and possibly penalty charges. The Revenue will not prompt you
to make additional payments.
Q. What should I do if I do not have all my figures ready in time to
complete my tax return?
A. You should do your best to estimate your likely liability but you should
explain why you are making an estimate and the basis for your calculations.
Top up any underpayment as soon as possible.
Q. What if I think the inspector may not agree with my calculations?
A. You could submit your return well before the payment date so that
contentious issues can be cleared up. This would minimise the risk of having
to pay interest or penalties.
Q. I have been late in preparing for the introduction of Pay and File. What
can I do to make up lost time?
A. You should make sure any tax backlog which has built up under the present
system is cleared. The Revenue has said it will not accept a backlog from
previous years as a reasonable excuse for failing to submit a return on
time.
You should also review your accounting systems to ensure they can produce
the information you need. You should plan a timetable for producing future
accounts and tax returns. It may make sense to allocate responsibility for
understanding and handling Pay and File to one or two people in your
company.
Free booklets/fact sheets on the subject of Pay and File are available from
many accountants. They include: 'Pay and File. It's nearer than you think.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): In the super league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has a 'super league' of middle-sized companies capable of making a
considerable contribution to employment and economic growth but which have
been overlooked in the enthusiasm for small businesses.
This is the conclusion of a survey* of 3,500 fast-growing middle-sized
companies - dubbed the 'super league' - by 3i, the development capital
group, and Cranfield School of Management.
The typical managing director of these companies is aged between 45 and 50
years and has worked for 10 years in the same industry. 'Whizz kids are
rare,' the report's authors comment.
The researchers sought out from records at Companies House profitable,
privately owned businesses which had achieved sales growth of at least 25
per cent a year over a two-year period - 1989 and 1990. They selected
companies with turnover of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 100m at the
beginning of the period.
Nearly 3,500 companies or 11 per cent of the total met these criteria. Their
aggregate turnover doubled to Pounds 18.4bn over the two years.
The super-league companies provide employment for 244,000 people, a 30 per
cent increase over the two years.
Twenty six per cent were in manufacturing compared with 10 per cent for the
UK as a whole. Twenty nine per cent of the companies were engaged in
distribution, 18 per cent in construction and 16 per cent in transport and
other services. The average gearing of these companies was 1.08 compared
with 0.5 per cent for all companies.
As a whole the middle-sized sector is numerically weak in the UK and suffers
from a lack of public attention and encouragement, 3i said. 'If the UK
authorities are seriously interested in promoting growth and creating jobs
then this neglect must be abandoned,' it added.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): VAT moves 'a timid step
forward' - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government needs to be far more radical in its proposals for abolishing
the small firms audit if it is to stimulate enterprise, according to a
report by the Small Business Bureau, a Tory party organisation which lobbies
for the sector's interests.
The bureau describes the government's present proposal, to exempt companies
with an annual turnover below the VAT registration threshold of Pounds
37,600 as 'a timid step forward'. The Department of Trade and Industry's
thinking appears 'woolly and lacking in commercial reality,' it adds.
It calls for the audit to be removed as a mandatory requirement for all
companies defined as 'small' by the Companies Act. This would extend
exemption to companies meeting at least two of the following requirements:
sales under Pounds 2.8m, a gross balance sheet of less than Pounds 1.4m and
fewer than 50 employees.

Ninety-eight per cent of companies which established close 'partnership'
relations with their suppliers or customers achieved substantial business
improvements, according to a survey by Partnership Sourcing, a joint
CBI/Department of Trade initiative.
Partnerships involve customers working closely with suppliers in fields such
as product development, deliveries and marketing (see this page August 3).
Of the 356 companies questioned 85 per cent said they had improved their
service to customers, 75 per cent had cut costs, 72 per cent had reduced
stocks and 70 per cent had improved quality.
One trend to emerge from the survey was the need for purchasing departments

FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Fund sows seeds of
consistency - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Start-up companies have missed out on the growth of Britain's venture
capital industry in recent years. As venture funds have grown it has become
uneconomic for them to devote much time to time-consuming small investments.
One fund which has displayed remarkable consistency in backing early-stage
businesses has been the Seed Capital Fund, managed by Lucius Cary, publisher
of Venture Capital Report, which attempts to unite entrepreneurs and
investors.
Cary is currently raising his fifth and largest fund yet and has set a
target of Pounds 2m. Two large institutions have already promised Pounds 1m.
Seed Capital's ideal company is innovative, with a technology base and
within easy reach of Cary's offices* in Henley on Thames. The larger fund
will allow Seed Capital to follow up its initial investment, typically
around Pounds 50,000, with further funds when necessary, says Cary.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Growing optimism over
prospects - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses have become more optimistic about their prospects and one
in four is now planning to expand over the next six months, according to a
survey of more than 1,200 businesses by National Westminster Bank. The
findings of this survey, carried out in July, showed an improvement on
January 1993, when only one in five small firms had plans to expand.
Closer analysis showed that the 'smaller' small firms were more cautious,
with only 20 per cent of those with turnover of less than Pounds 50,000
planning to expand, while 37 per cent of those with sales between Pounds
500,000 and Pounds 1m had similar plans.
Optimism was highest in London and the east Midlands where just over one
third of small firms planned to grow and lowest in Yorkshire (18 per cent)
and Lancashire and the north-west (21 per cent each).

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Tecs ranked as worst performers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and enterprise councils in London have been ranked among the worst
performers of the 75 Tecs in England. The results come in the first
published league tables on the employer-led bodies' relative performance.
Essex Tec was the worst performing.
The tables do not cover the full range of Tec activities and group the Tecs
into four tables, or quartiles, to show how effectively they have spent the
Pounds 1.7bn provided by the government for training schemes in 1992-93. The
Tecs are judged by seven criteria of cost and performance.
The government hopes that publication of the tables will encourage directors
and staff in the worst-performing Tecs to achieve the performance of the
best.
Significant variations between Tecs have been highlighted.
Dorset Tec appeared in the top quartile for six out of seven of the tables
covering cost-effectiveness and quality of provision for Youth Training and
Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults, and the number of
companies committed to Investors in People, a scheme to improve the training
of people in work.
Other high-performing Tecs included Barnsley and Doncaster, Metrotec in
Wigan and Camtec in Cambridge.
Essex Tec was alone in appearing in the bottom group of all seven tables,
closely followed by those from London.
Tecs, while welcoming publication of the indicators, said they should be
treated with caution, not least because they did not reflect areas of
enterprise and economic development.
The Department of Employment has admitted that the league tables are only a
rough guide, as they have not been weighted to reflect local unemployment
rates or the impact of the recession on the south of England. In addition
some of the measures are not very precise.
However, the department said that the tables did give some indication of the
quality of management in Tecs with similar labour markets. It is understood
to have dismissed a ranking of one to 75 as inaccurate.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, said: 'Exhaustive comparisons
are not possible from these tables. For example, they do not measure value
added, and they are not adjusted to take into account comparative labour
markets.'
Tecs in Wales and their Scottish equivalents - Local Enterprise Companies -
have not been included.

FT  14 SEP 93 / AEA smoothes way for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEA Technology, formerly the UK Atomic Energy Authority, has announced
reorganisation plans which could help smooth its path towards privatisation.
AEA has told its 8,000 staff that, from next April, it is to divide its
activities into three separate divisions to differentiate more clearly
between core businesses.
Staff have already been told that the workforce will fall to around 7,500 by
next March. A spokesman said yesterday that the reorganisation could lead to
a further reduction in employee numbers.
No details of job losses are yet available but the company has said it hopes
any redundancies can be made on a voluntary basis.
Under the structure AEA will run a commercial division, which it hopes will
provide the basis for any sell-off, and a government division which will
continue to handle all government nuclear installations and liabilities.
There will also be a services division.
The changes follow an analysis of AEA's activities undertaken as part of the
company's representations to the government on privatisation. Ministers
commissioned their own report on moving AEA into the private sector in
April.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, said the changes were 'logical and,
indeed, essential to securing AEA's successful future'.

FT  14 SEP 93 / DSS may cushion water charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL SECURITY may help cushion poorer households if the installation of
water meters pushes up their bills, Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said
yesterday.
Controversy about the impact of metering is set to increase after the
publication yesterday of the results of three-year trials of water meters in
England and Wales. Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority, the industry
regulators, have joined the government in backing an extension of metering
as a way of charging customers.
Most households now pay a flat annual fee based on property value under the
old rating system, but water companies must find a new basis for charging by
the year 2000. Some households are likely to pay less if meters are
installed - including pensioners living alone, one sixth of the total,
according to Mr Yeo.
However large families will probably pay more. Ms Janet Langdon, director of
the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and
sewerage companies said: 'We think it is essential that the social security
system provides some support for those households who can't pay their bill'.
The largest water meter trial, in the Isle of Wight, covering 50,000
households, suggested that they used 21 per cent less water after a meter
was fitted. However 11 smaller trials, covering some 10,000 households,
found an average drop of only 11 per cent compared with similar unmetered
areas.
The report also concluded that installation and running costs were high. The
Isle of Wight trial suggested the running costs of a metered system were on
average Pounds 19.08 a year higher than a system based on rateable values.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Government set to delay nuclear industry review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TERMS FOR the long-awaited government review of the UK nuclear industry are
unlikely to be published before November and may be delayed until the end of
the year.
Publication is being held up partly because of Whitehall fears that it could
complicate public consultation on the future of the Thorp and Sizewell B
nuclear plants.
In addition, the review's terms of reference are being debated by at least
three government departments.
The Department of Trade and Industry's early preference for a narrow review
has caused concern in both the Department of Environment and the Treasury.
The DTI had hoped to concentrate on whether the private sector would finance
a new nuclear station.
It has also argued that the nuclear review could be relatively quick because
the coal review, conducted earlier this year, covered some of the ground
when it decided against early closure of the Magnox nuclear power stations.
But the Treasury wants a thorough examination of the government's future
liabilities and of whether privatisation is feasible. Some at the Department
of Environment want the review to consider environmental factors fully.
Reconciling these differing interests is likely to push publication of the
terms of reference beyond the end of the public consultation on Thorp, which
ends on October 4, and on Sizewell B, which ends four days later.
Whitehall officials have been concerned that a nuclear review would be
handicapped if the future of Thorp and Sizewell B was still uncertain.
Originally the review was scheduled to take place in 1994, but was brought
forward on the advice of the Commons trade and industry committee.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER EVIDENCE of Tory disarray over taxation is set to emerge when Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, argues against further tax increases
in an article which is due to be published in a right-wing journal on the
eve of the Conservative party conference.
His article for Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite pressure group, is
said to call for deeper spending cuts instead of tax rises in the unified
Budget statement in November.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S INTERNAL divisions will surface again today, with a pamphlet
calling for the adoption of a Pounds 20bn investment programme and other
radical policies, and making a vigorous attack on the party's 'modernisers'.
The analysis by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath and secretary of the
Tribune group of MPs, argues that to win the next election, Labour must
'celebrate socialist values'. This differs with other analyses, which have
suggested that the party's defeat in last year's election came partly
because it was still seen as not 'moderate' enough.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Tories deny banking favours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of Scotland yesterday leapt to the defence of the Conservative
party after Labour sought an assurance that the bank was not giving the
organisation preferential treatment over its overdraft, Alison Smith writes.
Both the bank and Conservative Central Office said that the Tory party was
being charged a commercial rate.
The financial report in the Conservative party conference agenda, which was
published yesterday, said that the revenue deficit was Pounds 18.6m, but
that a small surplus was hoped for this year.
There was a fall, however, in the payments that constituencies were supposed
to make, and these quota payments totalled only Pounds 1.23m compared with
Pounds 1.44m the previous year.
Earlier yesterday Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said that
substantial progress had been made in putting the party's finances on a
sounder footing.
Royal Bank's statement came after Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and
industry secretary, demanded that the bank justify or change its treatment
of the Tories.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Bath: a beautiful city of burglars and beggars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFIC POLLUTION, aggressive beggars, drunken gangs, ram raiders, empty
shops . . . this could be one of Britain's more deprived urban areas. But it
is Bath, a genteel Georgian city and world heritage site attracting 2m
visitors a year, as depicted in a 'city centre audit'.
The audit is by Ms Kimberly Paumier, appointed manager of the city centre in
April to help revitalise it. An American, she is described by Bath's chief
executive, Mr Clive Abbott, as someone who is 'able to take a fresh and
critical view'.
Ms Paumier's first report, which went to Bath council's environment
committee yesterday, says that 'Bath is a beautiful city, gifted with
resources and assets not found in most UK cities'. It also praises the Roman
and Georgian architecture, the quality of the shops and culture - there are
17 museums.
However, the report also points to poor road connections and congested
streets, high levels of pollution and a scruffy railway station.
Although the city is described as one of Britain's top retail locations, Ms
Paumier says a perception that rates and rents are higher than elsewhere has
increased the number of vacant shops. For retailers who remain in business,
ram-raiding is a significant problem and the council is to consider
closed-circuit television.
The report highlights concern over drunks and travellers causing tension and
animosity. Ms Paumier welcomes busking and street theatre as assets for
Bath, but 'the amount of aggressive begging is a growing threat', she says.
Ms Paumier adds: 'Bath after dark can sometimes be a threatening place' with
large groups of 'often drunk or disruptive' youths. The police, 'tend to
stay at a distance for fear that they might incite further aggression'.
Among Ms Paumier's proposals are a leisure and health spa to encourage
overnight stays by visitors, more conference facilities and greater use of
the river Avon.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Pounds 40m regional telecoms network planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER boost to tele-communications competition in England is imminent
with the launch of a regional telecoms company by Yorkshire Electricity and
Kingston Communications.
The two companies intend to build a fibre-optic network covering Yorkshire
and Humberside, using Yorkshire Electricity's pylons and Kingston's
expertise and local network covering the city of Hull. The new Pounds 40m
joint-venture company, to be called Torch Communications, will be set up in
the next few weeks if the boards of the parent companies give approval and
if a full telecommunications operating licence is granted by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
Torch plans to enter the market next summer, shortly after the launch of a
third national fibre-optic network by Energis, a subsidiary of the National
Grid. Energis will also use pylons for most of its network.
Torch will focus on the business market, offering trunking and switched
services to companies and other large users. It will also act as a
wholesaler, leasing lines to companies and selling services to other
telecommunications operators.
An inter-connection agreement with British Telecommunications is under
negotiation.
The venture marks a significant broadening of horizons for Kingston
Communications, the only municipally owned public telecommunications
operator in the UK. Operationally independent of Hull council, the company
is keen to expand its market following the abolition of the BT/Mercury
national duopoly.
Torch marks a further significant investment in telecommunications for
Yorkshire Electricity, one of the privatised distribution companies.
Yorkshire also has a stake in Ionica, the Cambridge-based company building a
radio-based national network for launch in early 1995.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, Yorkshire Electricity's chief executive, said: 'We want
to take advantage of the full range of opportunities in the growing
telecommunications business.
'This is very much a long-term affair, but we will be interested in talking
to other operators to see if there are joint opportunities.'
It may soon become the first regional electricity company to expand its core
businesses of distribution and supply outside the UK. Last month it
announced discussions with the city of Turku, Finland, about the possible
acquisition of its electricity distribution business.
In June the company reported a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
156.3m and a 15 per cent rise in total dividends.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Used car sales surge by 19.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST month's unexpectedly strong surge in sales of new cars was more than
matched in the market for used cars, providing a further indication that the
recovery is gaining pace.
The number of used cars bought on credit - the industry's main means of
tracking the used sector - jumped by 19.8 per cent to 86,955 in August
compared with the same month a year ago, according to statistics from HPI,
the vehicle credit monitoring organisation.
This rise compares with nearly 18 per cent for new cars, and brings the
increase in credit sales of used cars in the first eight months of the year
to 668,146 - 10.8 per cent above the equivalent 1992 period.
Hopes that the severely-depressed light commercial vehicle sector may soon
start to revive were boosted by HPI statistics showing that credit sales of
used light commercial vehicles were also up sharply, by 17.1 per cent to
24,712 in August. However, for the first eight months as a whole they were
down 9 per cent.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Councils hit at plan to expand Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO construct a Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at London's
Heathrow airport, and government proposals to increase the number of night
flights, have led to fierce opposition from local authorities near the
world's busiest international airport.
The London Borough of Hounslow yesterday voted against the expansion
proposals, arguing that the plans put forward by BAA, the privatised
airports operator, would create unacceptable increases in road traffic,
aircraft noise, night flights and pollution. It said there would also be
pressure for the construction of a third runway at Heathrow.
'The economic benefits of Terminal Five are outweighed by the disadvantages
of the massive new development,' said Mr Bob Whatley, a Hounslow councillor.
BAA is anxious to develop a fifth terminal to meet future air-travel demand
at the already congested airport and to fend off other European competitors
such as Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt which are seeking to challenge
Heathrow's role as an international hub.
Hounslow is the first of a number of London local authorities getting ready
to fight a planning inquiry into the new terminal project which is due to
start in 1995.
The Hounslow move also coincides with a challenge by local authorities
around Heathrow against government proposals to change night-flight
regulations at the airport.
The local authorities, including Richmond, Windsor and Maidenhead,
Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Slough, have won a judicial review of the
government proposals.
The government is planning to introduce a new quota system for night flights
based on the noise performance of aircraft, replacing the system based on a
specific number of aircraft movements.
The local authorities say that the new system would increase the overall
number of night flights and cause more disturbance for local residents.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Building costs set to rise: Contractors will pass on
materials price increases, RICS says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION costs could rise by nearly 4 per cent next year because
contractors are no longer able to absorb the rising price of building
materials, according to a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey
published today.
Contractors face growing pressure as increases in materials prices eat away
profit margins, said the institution in its quarterly study of building
costs.
'Over the next two years, the price of materials is expected to rise above
the general rate of inflation,' said Mr Christopher Vickers, the
institution's construction spokesman.
'As a result the bubble will burst and contractors, unable to absorb rising
costs, will be forced to increase their bids for tender.'
The study highlights an issue of growing concern for building contractors.
Building materials prices fell steeply in the early 1990s, but have recently
begun to rise again.
Throughout the recession, intense competition in the construction industry
has forced tender prices down, and contractors have had little or no hope of
passing rises in materials prices on to customers. Subcontractors,
meanwhile, have complained that larger contractors have been delaying
payments to them.
The institution's survey showed that tender prices have stabilised at
early-1987 levels, ending three years of decline. The cost of building is 23
per cent lower than the peak levels recorded in 1989.
The institution said tender prices were unchanged in the second quarter of
this year, compared with the previous quarter, and expected them to hold
steady until the first quarter of next year.
Then, however, increasing material and wage costs would prompt a resurgence
of tender price inflation. By the fourth quarter tender prices would be
nearly 4 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of this year.
The institution said building material prices were expected to rise 5.3 per
cent in the 12 months to the third quarter of 1994, followed by a further
5.5 per cent increase in the 12 months after that.
In line with other industry forecasts, the institution said that
construction output would continue to decline, but grow by 1 per cent in
1994, 'progressing gradually' in 1995.
Although this is a modest rate of recovery, it would at least give
contractors more hope of passing on materials increases to customers than
they have at present.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Unionists present Major with 'new Ulster proposals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMOCRATIC Unionist Party in Northern Ireland has approached Mr John
Major, the prime minister, with what it claims are new proposals on the
province.
A document called 'Breaking the Logjam', was sent to Downing Street
yesterday with a request from Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, for a meeting
with the prime minister.
The move has effectively bypassed the Northern Ireland Office, which has
been working for the past 10 months to get the main political parties in the
province back around the negotiating table.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, brushed aside this
latest snub. He said in Londonderry yesterday: 'I am concerned only to
secure what the vast majority of everyday people in Northern Ireland want,
namely to see the politicians talking. I am very interested to see whatever
proposals any party leader may have.'
The DUP has remained silent on the specifics of its new proposals, but it is
thought they flesh out ideas on the DUP's favourite theme - the devolution
of power to the province.
Mr Peter Robinson, the deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'These
proposals are an alternative to a process which has failed in the past and
which is bound to fail if it is tried again.'
He added: 'We do not believe that the process will produce a way forward.'
Last Friday Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, met
in London and reaffirmed their commitment to restarting the 'round-table'
talks. These came to a halt last November, without agreement, and the DUP
has since insisted that the Irish Republic must drop its territorial claim
to Northern Ireland before talks can restart.
The DUP has since set down a further pre-condition - that Mr John Hume, the
leader of the SDLP, must end his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of
Sinn Fein.
Mr Hume said that his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, which started last
April, were aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence' in
Northern Ireland.
At the weekend Mr Hume said he was also willing to meet with leaders of the
Loyalist paramilitary organisations, following statements attributed last
week to a leader of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association in a Belfast
newspaper.
The statements advocated political talks 'with everything on the table'
provided the IRA ended its military campaign.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Public backs pension equalisation at 65, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of the public is in favour of the qualifying age for state
pension benefits being equalised at 65, according to an opinion poll
conducted for the Confederation of British Industry.
The poll, by Gallup, suggests that while most people support a phasing-in
period - so that women now approaching 60 should not have their retirement
expectations disappointed - most also appreciate the potential impact on the
social security budget of universal retirement at 60.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the findings 'show that people
have a much better understanding of the realities of this important issue
than is generally appreciated.
'People recognise that the ultimate costs of equality in the state scheme at
60 are insupportable. Older people, who have been expecting women to be able
to draw their pension from 60, are understandably less keen to change. But
even in the 45-64 age range, four in every 10 do not want to see age 60
adopted for everyone.'
Mr Davies added: 'The figures offer clear pointers for government policy.
The public is ready to support a long-term strategy to move to equality at
65, combined with a reasonable transition period. That would be firmly in
line with moves in other major economies.' The poll showed that 52 per cent
of respondents do not wish to see 60 adopted as the retirement age. However,
48 per cent said they would contenance the extra cost or face cuts elsewhere
in the social security budget to introduce universal retirement at 60.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Whitehall and judiciary clash in arms probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING unease within Whitehall with the way Lord Justice Scott is
conducting the arms-for-Iraq inquiry resurfaced yesterday on the first day
of public hearings after the summer recess.
Mr David Gore-Booth, the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told the inquiry team:
'I think you underestimate the intelligence of Her Majesty's ministers.'
He was speaking during a hearing marked by continuous heated exchanges
mainly between himself and Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the inquiry's
counsel. The official also at one point clashed with the judge when he said
the judge did not understand adequately the workings of Whitehall.
Mr Gore-Booth was a Foreign Office official responsible for the Middle East
between January 1989 and January 1993. He was questioned on how officials
could justify keeping from parliament a Whitehall decision to relax the
guidelines restricting defence exports to Iraq at the end of 1988.
Mr Gore-Booth justified a decision by Whitehall's Interdepartmental
Committee to approve the export of an IBM computer for the Iraqi military
industrial plant of Nassr after ignoring warnings from intelligence and
defence experts of its potential military use.
Mr Gore-Booth said: 'Intelligence is a very imprecise art . . . if the IDC
reached that conclusion, that is good enough for me and good enough for my
masters.'
During 1989 government ministers - briefed by Whitehall officials -
repeatedly told parliament that the guidelines announced in the Commons in
1985 were being strictly adhered to.
However, documents made available to the Scott inquiry show that the wording
of the guidelines had been changed to make it easier for British companies
to export defence-related goods to Iraq.
Mr Gore-Booth laughed when Miss Baxendale suggested that a parliamentary
question should be fully answered by the minister.
'The question should be answered in such a way as to give maximum degree of
satisfaction to the questioner. It doesn't necessary need to be full,' Mr
Gore-Booth said.
Mr Gore-Booth provided the judge with a list of defence exports to Iraq
during the 1980s which he said showed the relatively small amounts involved.
However, he admitted during cross-examination that the list was incomplete
as it did not include dual-use equipment such as machine tools.
The public hearing continues today.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Local authorities granted easing of tendering rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be exempt from the government's new regulations on
compulsory competitive tendering for white-collar services if they have
already conducted a market test, the government said yesterday.
This relaxation of the tendering rules, announced by the local government
minister, Mr David Curry, was welcomed by local authorities. The Association
of County Councils said that many councils had already opened their
professional services to competition without the need for the government to
make such moves compulsory.
The Association of District Councils also welcomed the move, but called on
the government to announce the full compulsory rules for white-collar
tendering as soon as possible.
It said that otherwise there was a risk that councils could go to great
expense on market testing exercises, and then have to repeat them when new
regulations were announced.
Under the concessions announced by Mr Curry, councils will be exempt from
compulsory tendering of work for up to five years if contracts for the work
have been awarded after they had attracted at least three tenders from
external contractors, as well as from the council's direct service
organisations.
Authorities that have failed to meet this criterion but believe their
contracts have been adequately tested against the market are able to apply
to the Department of the Environment for the exemption.
Councils needed to have attracted the three tenders by yesterday to qualify
for the exemption. Councils which have not yet done so will be required to
go through the formal tendering process already outlined in existing
legislation.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, could find himself in the centre of a
commercial dogfight when he arrives in Kuala Lumpur next week on the second
leg of an official visit to Japan and Malaysia.
In line with his policy of making every overseas trip a flag-waving exercise
for British industry, Mr Major will be accompanied by a dozen leading
businessmen, led by Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former Tory cabinet
minister.
Downing Street has refused to release the names of the others involved.
However, Japanese officials confirmed that Mr Major will be accompanied by
Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and former trade and
industry secretary, and Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of British
Telecommunications.
Cable &amp; Wireless and BT are understood to be pursuing a share of a
potentially lucrative contract to provide a second telecommunications
network to compete with Telekom Malaysia, the monopoly domestic carrier.
Telekom Malaysia is also seeking overseas partners to help develop its
internation operations.
Lord Young would say only that Cable &amp; Wireless was 'trying hard' to win a
share of the contract. Mr Vallance was not available for comment. However
officials confirmed the companies were 'not entirely happy' about the
presence on the trip of both chairmen.
'Frankly, it is bizarre,' said one. 'This sort of thing really confuses
foreign governments. How are they supposed to know which company is
representing Britain? This sort of trip is quite important when you are
dealing with government licences, but it's anyone's guess what the
Malaysians will make of this.'
The prime minister may also find himself mediating in Tokyo, where Mr
Anthony Greener, chairman of Guinness, will press hard for changes in
Japanese excise laws, which discriminate against imported spirits such as
Scotch whisky.
Guinness wants Tokyo to follow its decision earlier this year to abolish
import tariffs on spirits by removing the excise tax advantage enjoyed by
Japanese spirits.
'Hopefully, the fact that we are going with the prime minister will
underline our view that it is time for Japan to do this,' Mr Greener said.
'It cannot be allowed to stand in the way of good relations between Japan
and Britain.'
The other businessmen accompanying Mr Major will be: Sir Ralph Robins,
chairman of Rolls-Royce; Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry; Mr John Russell, a former chairman of ICI
Japan; Mr Peter Williams, chairman of Oxford Instruments; Sir Alan Cockshaw,
chairman of Amec, the construction company; Mr Robert Evans, chairman of
British Gas; Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever; and Sir David Scholey,
chairman of securities group SG Warburg.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Oil exploration licences granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has awarded five new on-shore petroleum exploration licences
in locations ranging from the Yorkshire region to an area between the North
and South Downs in Surrey and Sussex.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the award of the licences to Eukan
Energy Limited and Altwood Petroleum was made outside the formal licensing
rounds for exploration acreage.
It was the first use of the 'out-of-round procedure', under which companies
can apply to the government for acreage in areas where they believe early
exploration for oil and gas is merited. 'The use of the out-of-round
procedure in this case is another example of the flexibility of our
licensing system,' Mr Eggar said.
The five licences are in the following areas:
Yorkshire, north-east of Sheffield.
the Staffordshire/Cheshire border north-east of Stoke-on-Trent.
the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border north-west of Nottingham.
Surrey and Sussex between the North and South Downs.
All of the licences are on private land. The companies will need planning
permission and the owners' consent before they can begin seismic testing and
exploratory drilling. A separate government appraisal licence would be
required if any oil or gas is discovered.
In another move intended to demonstrate flexibility in on-shore oil and gas
exploration, the government allowed Tullow Exploration temporarily to extend
its seismic work 1km beyond the boundaries of two licences it holds in
Lincolnshire. Mr Eggar said the award of the new type of seismic survey
licence was 'a clear demonstration of our commitment to support oil and gas
companies through a flexible licensing system'.
The licence awarded yesterday does not allow any drilling and only covers
areas adjacent to a principal licence. It will last for one year.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Obituary: Trenchant analyst of energy - Andrew Holmes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDREW HOLMES, editor of the FT's Power in Europe newsletter, has died aged
36, following a long battle against brain cancer.
Born in Strathclyde, Andy Holmes joined the Financial Times group in 1982
after a period as a press officer in the Department of Energy. His deep
knowledge of the energy sector and of government bureaucracy were two of his
many assets as a journalist.
He was an early editor of European Energy Report and in 1987 launched Power
in Europe, which achieved prominence and influence during the debate over
energy privatisation. Holmes was an especially trenchant analyst of the
nuclear power sector, arguing at a time when it was unfashionable to do so
that the coal industry was emerging as a casualty of government policy.
A vigorous scoop-getter, he was named Energy Journalist of the Year in 1989
by the British Institute of Energy Economics, which said he had 'raised the
level of debate' on privatisation.
His views were expressed in a series of books, broadcasts and in evidence to
the Commons energy committee. Beyond that, his loves were music, literature
and football. His dry wit could be devastating, his humour and generosity
exceptional.
Andy Holmes is survived by his wife Claire, daughter Lottie, and son Jack.

FT  14 SEP 93 / W Midlands companies cut capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL INVESTMENT by quoted companies in the West Midlands has fallen by 6
per cent on average in the past year, the annual report on the regional
economy by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, shows. The drop was
third successive annual decline as the region's industry struggles to
overcome recession, said KPMG.
Smaller companies - with a market value of less than Pounds 50m - were hit
by low demand and cut spending by more than 25 per cent. Total cash spending
on acquisitions also fell by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 557m during the
year.
KPMG's report was based on the latest results of the 125 quoted companies in
the West Midlands. It said falling expenditure was a realistic indicator
that the economy was still in recession.
Although it drew some comfort from a 7 per cent increase in overall turnover
and a marginal fall in pre-tax profits, down to Pounds 1.85bn compared with
Pounds 1.86bn last year, KPMG said it was concerned by the inability of some
sectors to exploit the signs of recovery elsewhere in the country.
The worst-hit sectors were the motor industry and construction and property.
Their poor performance was offset only by strong results from retailing,
utility and electronics companies, the report said.
Mr Terry Gateley, head of KPMG Corporate Finance in Birmingham, said: 'The
region's smaller public companies bore the brunt of the recession with their
turnover down 6 per cent and pre-tax profits down 24 per cent.'
In spite of the gloomy results and a sharp increase in borrowing, Mr Gateley
applauded the region's largest groups such as Tarmac, Cadbury Schweppes and
TI, which had survived the recession.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Lloyd's may seek market cash to settle writs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON may ask the agencies that manage syndicates at the market
and brokers who trade there to make financial contributions to help settle
long-running litigation involving Names.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said that Lloyd's 'might well come to
the conclusion that the chairman should invite people in the market to
contribute to a fund if this made a settlement possible'.
Money to settle legal actions involving several thousand Names - the
individuals who pledge their wealth to back the market - could also come
from two other sources: errors and omissions insurers, which insure agencies
against legal awards for negligence, and the Lloyd's central fund, which
meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations.
'If we come to the point where we need some money in addition I'm confident
that the chairman will be able to persuade the market that we need their
help,' said Mr Middleton, adding that he was now more confident about a
settlement than he had been three months ago.
Last year efforts to persuade agencies and brokers to contribute to a Pounds
50m hardship fund for stricken Names were unsuccessful. This failure was
partially because Lloyd's failed in its efforts to secure charitable status
for the proposed scheme.
But Mr Middleton said the scheme had failed because 'the old Lloyd's people
made public pronouncements before they had done their homework'.
Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank, who heads a Lloyd's panel
examining the financial resources available for a settlement, would be
involved in any market appeal.
Figures published yesterday in Lloyd's guide to corporate membership showed
the extent to which the central fund has been stretched by recent claims.
At 31 August the amount 'earmarked' from the central fund to meet claims
that Names have not yet paid or may be unable to pay amounted to Pounds
1.195bn, briefly in excess of the fund's Pounds 1bn, compared to Pounds 636m
at the same time last year and Pounds 200m in 1991.
The amount of funds 'earmarked' typically declines as Names meet calls upon
them.
By the end of last year the amount 'earmarked' had fallen to Pounds 354.9m,
for example. Lloyd's has other assets which can be matched against these
liabilities.
The guide also shows that overall net assets available to the society of
Lloyd's have declined in recent years. By the end of 1992 these amounted to
Pounds 6.091bn, compared with Pounds 6.537bn at the end of 1991.

MR JOHN Birt, BBC director-general, last night argued against any freeze in
the television licence fee. Speaking at a launch to celebrate the BBC
education department's 70th anniversary, he said: 'We must argue fiercely .

The government is considering a report it commissioned from consultants
Touche Ross which is believed to present as an option a cut in the real
value of the Pounds 83 licence fee.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Business failures drop by 25%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of business failures fell by 25 per cent in the second quarter of
this year compared with the same period last year, Trade Indemnity, the
trade credit insurer, said yesterday.
There were 1,433 business failures and bad debtors reported to the company
during April to June this year, down from 1,767 in the first quarter and
1,911 in the second quarter of last year.
All regions experienced a lower number of failures than the same period last
year except the north of England and Northern Ireland.
Trade Indemnity said the figures were proof that recovery was now
established. But it warned that low inflation might simply be delaying some
banks from calling in receivers against other companies because the
realisable value of their assets was still so low.

<TEXT>
BRITANNIA, the UK's ninth largest building society, is to buy Life
Association of Scotland, the UK life-insurance subsidiary of the Dutch-based
Internationale Nederlanden Group, Norma Cohen writes.
The move is part of a growing trend in banks and building societies to
purchase their own life-insurance subsidiaries and sell their products
through their branches.
Mr John Heaps, Britannia managing director, said it intends to inject about
Pounds 25m into its new subsidiary over the next two years. Britannia will
sell LAS products both through its 250 branches and through independent
financial advisers.
The direct sales operation will be integrated into Britannia's existing
sales force.
Britannia is the largest building society retailing its own
financial-services products with Pounds 2.5bn in assets under management.
LAS has Pounds 950m in assets under management.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Visa tightens card security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS may be required within three years to print holographic patterns on
all new Visa credit cards' magnetic stripes in an effort to combat fraud, it
emerged yesterday.
Large numbers of card issuers around the world will also introduce
micro-chips and other security measures under plans unveiled by Visa
International, the largest global credit card network.
The details emerged as Visa announced a 13 per cent fall in fraud losses to
Pounds 19.8m for the first four months of this year, compared with the same
period in 1992. Visa said credit card fraud was now 0.15 per cent of
expenditure on its cards, the lowest proportion since it introduced cards in
1969.
Mr John Hutchinson, managing director of Visa UK, said: 'We are not
complacent but we have a feeling we are getting on top of fraud.'
He said the reduction was caused by factors including greater education of
card users, more secure deliveries of cards, improved systems to detect
fraud by retailers, and the 'card verification value' - a secret code in the
magnetic stripe on cards.
The decline came in spite of a 7 per cent increase in Visa card numbers and
a 14 per cent increase in expenditure.
Visa has 54 per cent of the world market for credit cards, supporting 109m
cards incurring Dollars 470m (Pounds 300m) in expenditure each year.
Cardholders in the UK with 28m cards spent Pounds 10bn in the last year.
The two magnetic-stripe designs being considered are a magnetically readable
number or 'watermark' which cannot be erased or copied, or a 'holomagnetic'
pattern and code printed on top of the strip.
Many credit cards are now equipped with a micro-chip. Mr Hutchinson said
these would be introduced far more widely in the next few years.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Tokyo split over moves to cut surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENCES have emerged in Tokyo's new coalition government over whether to
accept US demands for numerically targeted cuts in Japan's swollen current
account surplus.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said yesterday that he would study
the issue of targets, but added that it would be difficult to set goals for
the surplus.
He was responding to remarks in Washington at the weekend by Mr Tsutomu
Hata, foreign minister, that Japan might consider specific targets for
cutting the surplus with the US. This seemed a reversal of previous policy
on Japan's most important trade relationship.
Senior officials yesterday stressed there was no change in stance. However,
internal pressure for change is building up, with parts of the foreign
ministry keen to offer a compromise on this sensitive dispute when Mr
Hosokawa meets President Bill Clinton in New York at the end of the month.
There has been a chorus of calls recently from business leaders such as Mr
Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, for the
government to discuss such targets. They fear Japan's opposition to a
targeted cut is a factor in the yen's 20 per cent rise against the dollar
since January, which has made worse an already serious corporate profits
downturn.
Japan has so far successfully resisted US demands for a reduction in the
current account surplus to less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product
over three to four years.
The surplus hit Dollars 117.55bn, or 3.2 per cent of GDP last year and is
heading for 4 per cent of GDP this year. August trade figures, due out
today, are expected to confirm this trend.
The toughest opposition to trade targets comes from the finance and
international trade and industry ministries. They argue that they cannot
hope to hit such targets, even if agreed, because their influence over
Japan's increasingly free economy is declining. Unofficially, they see
targets as an unacceptable encroachment on what power they have left to
carry out economic and industrial intervention.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RESHUFFLE at the head of Nigeria's armed forces has strengthened the
position of General Sani Abacha as defence minister and swept aside allies
of former President Ibrahim Babangida as pressure builds on the interim
government to settle the dispute with Mr Moshood Abiola, winner of the
cancelled June elections.
The army-backed interim government led by Mr Ernest Shonekan has begun to
assert its independence from the Babangida regime and is still searching for
a compromise between the plan to hold fresh elections in February and the
demand by Mr Abiola and his supporters to uphold the result of the June
polls.
Gen Abacha has restructured the senior ranks of the armed forces, reversing
appointments made by retired Gen Babangida just before leaving office.
Babangida loyalists have been transferred to less powerful positions and
vocal opponents of the extension of military rule have been promoted to more
strategic posts.
Brig-Gen Halilu Akilu is being transferred from head of internal security to
director of army reserves, recruiting and resettlement. He will be replaced
by Brig-Gen A Abdullahi, the present defence attache in London. Four of the
key field commanders have been transferred to staff jobs.
Lt-Gen Joshua Dogonyaro and Air Commodore Nsikak Nduak, who were appointed
as chief of defence staff and chief of air staff respectively by Gen
Babangida, have also been replaced. The new chief of defence is Lt-Gen Dapo
Diya, a Yoruba who opposed the banning of Mr Abiola. Lt Gen Salihu Ibrahim,
an opponent of the military clinging to power, has retired and been replaced
by Lt Gen Aliyu Mohammed, formerly Gen Babangida's national security
adviser.
These changes will have done much to quell unrest in the middle and junior
ranks of the armed forces over the appointments made by Gen Babangida in
senior posts in the military and in the mainly civilian interim government.
Gen Abacha has emerged from the turmoil of recent months with his stature
enhanced. Although the only military member of the interim government and
the only survivor of the cadre of officers who ousted civilians from power a
decade ago, he is credited with forcing Gen Babangida to step aside.
The majority of the armed forces voted for Mr Abiola in the June polls and
the new posts may improve Mr Abiola's prospects of achieving his political
aims.
Mr Abiola claims the right to Nigeria's presidency but has been taking
refuge in Europe for over a month.

A SENIOR US official said yesterday that Washington was 'in no rush' to ask
the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North
Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
The US and South Korea earlier indicated that they might transfer the North
Korean nuclear issue to the UN unless Pyongyang achieved progress in nuclear
inspection talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
Seoul by the end of the month.
However, the US will not hold new talks with North Korea until there is
progress on inspection, said Mr Robert Gallucci, the assistant US secretary
of state for political and military affairs, in Seoul.
The US offered the possibility of expanded relations during two rounds of
talks with Pyongyang this summer in an attempt to persuade it to accept full
nuclear inspections. The US had scheduled a third round for mid-September.
But North Korea has so far refused to allow the IAEA to inspect two nuclear
waste facilities that could determine whether it has produced more
weapons-grade plutonium than it has declared to the Vienna-based agency.
North Korea has also rejected talks with Seoul on mutual nuclear inspections
unless the South Korean government accepts several conditions.
South Korea's chief prosecutor yesterday became the second senior judicial
official to resign within a week for property speculation. The resignation
of Mr Park Jong-cheol as prosecutor general follows that of chief justice
Kim Duck-joo.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Sale of Post points way back to China: Simon Holberton on
the Malaysian purchase of HK's English-language newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG passed another milestone on its journey back to China over the
weekend with the sale of the colony's leading English-language newspaper to
Chinese interests.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation sold 34.9 per cent of the South China
Morning Post, which has been published since 1903, to Mr Robert Kuok, a
Malaysian millionaire, for Dollars 349m. News Corp retains 15 per cent of
the paper but is not seen as a long-term holder of the stock.
The trading of assets between the wealthy in Hong Kong is a daily event but
what makes the sale of the Post important is the question it raises over the
future of an independent media in Hong Kong as British rule comes to an end
and the colony prepares for reunification with the mainland.
It has become plain that China's strategy in Hong Kong is to control the
centres of power in the colony, either directly or indirectly. The media is
just one of the commanding heights, along with the local legislature and the
civil service, which Beijing wants secured before it assumes full control of
Hong Kong in 1997.
The Post has hitherto been one of the few prominent supporters of Governor
Chris Patten's plans for greater political freedom in Hong Kong. The paper's
relatively modest 110,000 daily circulation belies its importance among
opinion makers; it is widely read by Hong Kong's educated Chinese elite, not
just by the colony's expatriate community.
Many at the Post, in the government and elsewhere expect the paper's
editorial position to come in line with that propounded by the New China
News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong. One government
official says: 'The Post was one of the few remaining independent newspapers
in Hong Kong. Now it's going to be compliant.'
This view is seen as not much more than special pleading by others.
According to a senior Sinologist at Hong Kong University: 'Let's face it,
under colonialism the Post was pro-colonial. It was the establishment
newspaper and after 1997 it will probably continue to be the establishment
newspaper. The ownership change simply reflects the changes under way within
the establishment.'
Echoes of these changes have been seen recently in other areas. Mr Martin
Lee, leader of the United Democrats, was refused representation by 11
leading firms of solicitors in July when he wanted to bring a suit for libel
against a leading figure in the colony who is also an adviser to Beijing.
Last month Mr Simon Murray stepped down from the managing directorship of
Hutchison Whampoa, becoming the last English 'taipan' of Hong Kong's oldest
trading company. Amicable though his leaving was, Mr Murray had become
frustrated. Mr Li Ka-shing, the company's owner, had banned him from
publicly supporting Mr Patten's plans for greater democracy lest it offend
China.
The Post's new owners are not likely to challenge China's policy towards
Hong Kong. Mr Kuok has extensive business interests in China, primarily in
hotels and property, oil refining and ports development. The management of
the paper in the future could well fall to Singapore Press Holdings,
publisher of the Straits Times; it already owns 5 per cent of the paper and
is seen as the likely buyers of Mr Murdoch's remaining interest.
Beijing has put great efforts into winning the support of newspaper
proprietors in Hong Kong. Through the Ministry of Propaganda, the
governmental face of the Communist party's United Front department,
proprietors are regularly feted in Beijing.
According to observers in Hong Kong there is both a positive and negative
side to this development. 'You can see it as a united front exercise with
Beijing co-opting influential people in Hong Kong,' says one. 'But China is
also changing and it has become more receptive to these people. There is a
confluence of interest.'
For others, a better indication of whether Hong Kong's media retains its
independence is how it reports on affairs in China. There are a number of
weekly and monthly magazines in the colony which give what appear to be
detailed accounts of the manoeuvrings of senior Communist party officials.
Others are used by senior Communist party officials to discredit political
competit ors.
According to these observers, none of whom wanted to be identified, the
survival of these magazines is a better bellwether of media independence
than the fate of Hong Kong's oldest English language daily.

<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, last night delivered a markedly
sober assessment of the next stages of negotiation with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, just hours after the emotionally-charged signing
ceremony with the PLO at the White House.
In a joint press conference with Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, Mr
Rabin laid out Israel's conditions during the installation of an interim
period of Palestinian rule in the West Bank and Gaza strip, while issuing a
challenge to the international community to back peace - notably the Gulf
states.
A tired-looking Mr Rabin also acknowledged the commitments made by Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO leader, which enabled Israeli recognition of the
organisation. But he said it would represent a change from the past only if
the PLO meets these conditions. 'I believe it's a change if the commitments
will be fulfilled,' he told reporters. 'We have decided to take a chance, to
put him into a test.'
Mr Rabin said Israel would insist on several 'key issues' during the next
round of discussions with the PLO. He said 'united Jerusalem must remain
united under Israel's sovereignty and our capital forever,' adding that the
issue of Jerusalem's status could nevertheless be discussed in negotiations
towards a final settlement. 'They are allowed to raise it,' he said.
He also said he wanted no existing Israeli settlements to be uprooted. In
addition, Israel would insist on keeping full responsibility for all
Israelis in settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. 'None of them (the
settlers) will come under the authority of the Palestinians in the council,'
he said, referring to the authority to be elected in nine months of the
start of the declaration of principles signed yesterday.
Mr Rabin also sketched a sombre picture of the economic needs of the West
Bank and, particularly Gaza, where he said: 'All the miseries - you can find
there.' He said Israel already spent Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) a year on
basic needs there, but said international aid would be necessary to make
peace work.
In a direct appeal to the Gulf states, whose relations with the PLO have
been icy since Mr Arafat's pro-Iraqi stand in the Gulf war, he said: 'Will
the world, which speaks so much about peace, will it be ready to take even
more than that?' Then he added: 'It can be done,' he added. 'It depends on
the realisation of the Arab rich countries who don't like Arafat . . . at
least to give money to the territories.'
In what had become a downbeat coda to the sunlit euphoria of the morning
signing, Mr Rabin said: 'If we do not create a hope, a real one that is
based on realities to the Gazans, that as a result of this agreement their
conditions will be improved - I don't know if this whole ceremony will lead
to a solution.'

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BENJAMIN Ben-Eliezer, Israel's minister of housing, has seen the worst
side of Arab-Israeli wars. Now, after 27 years as a combat soldier in all of
Israel's main post-independence conflicts, he is one of Israel's most ardent
supporters of peace.
'Its a very, very special day for me,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'A
day which could end years of fighting and offer new hope, new opportunities
and new challenges.'
Apart from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, Mr Ben-Eliezer - known in
Israel by his Arabic name Fouad - is the only general in the Israeli
cabinet. His support for the peace agreement springs directly from his long
career as a military man which began in 1954 when, at age 18, he joined the
elite Golani brigade of the Israel Defence Force.
'I owed some answers to my five children,' said the 58-year-old minister,
who was born in the Iraqi town of Basra and speaks, reads and writes fluent
Arabic. 'I wanted to make sure that after they completed their military
service if they were ever called again to fight another war with Arabs they
should know that my generation - the generation that fought for the country
across all those painful decades - had taken all the risks to change the
future and the destiny of our country.'
It is a remarkable statement for a man who has been at the cutting edge of
the battle against the Palestine Liberation Organisation. During the 1967
Six Day War he served as a commander of an elite reconnaissance battalion
making raids across enemy lines, in 1969 he was wounded during an airborne
raid on a PLO camp in Jordan and throughout the 1970s he fought the PLO in
Lebanon - becoming, in 1976, the first Israeli military officer to enter
Beirut when he slipped into the country from a missile boat to help build up
the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia, then fighting the PLO on the
streets of Beirut.
Later he was commander of southern Lebanon, military governor of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and co-ordinator of government activities in all
the occupied territories.
'For years we thought there was no alternative but to fight and fight and
fight. That is why this is such a historical change - hopefully to bring an
end to wars and battles and to bring something new - a new Middle East,' he
said.
In 1984 'Fouad' left the army, joined the Labour party and entered Israel's
parliament. He quickly earned the disapproval of many MPs when, in a
now-famous speech made a year before the eruption of the intifada
(Palestinian uprising) - he warned that the territories were heading for 'a
rebellion or mass civil disobedience. The process has begun and within three
to five years we will have a full-scale revolt on our hands'.
He said a whole generation of Palestinians had grown up knowing nothing but
military occupation and he urged Israel to seize the moment, make a drastic
change of direction, and give the Palestinians autonomy over their own
affairs. Nobody listened then. Six years later the Israeli nation agreed.
And the man tipped one day to be prime minister is looking like a visionary.
The agreement, Mr Ben-Eliezer says, is not without risks but they are
calculated risks. The greatest risks, he says, are the possibility of a
change in the leaderships of neighbouring Arabic states and the rise of
Islamic fundamentalism.
The greatest opportunities, he adds, are in a new Middle East of economic
co-operation, and he believes his ministry will be in the forefront of
building new roads and ports to service the Middle East.
Much will depend, he stresses, on whether the experimental trial period of
interim Palestinian self-rule works out and builds confidence on both sides.
And in a symbolic gesture, the minister yesterday opened a new housing
project for Israeli Arabs in Lod, right next to a Jewish neighbourhood.
'For centuries Arabs and Jews lived together. We are both Semitic peoples,
after all. I hope we can live in peace again, separately, but with mutual
respect, understanding and co-operation. We need to live together but also
separately because everyone has to live with something that belongs just to
him.'

SUPPORT among Israelis and Palestinians for the peace agreement signed in
Washington is steadily growing, according to a number of opinion polls
published yesterday.
Latest polls show that 62 per cent of Israeli Jews and 65 per cent of
Palestinians support the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord although an even larger
majority on both sides of the 'Green line', which divides Arab and Jew,
support the holding of referendums on the agreement.
In Israel a poll conducted by the Guttman Institute of Applied Social
Research among Israeli Jews found that 62 per cent are in favour of the
Gaza-Jericho deal, a marked increase on last week's 52 per cent. However, 66
per cent would like the government to hold a referendum or new elections.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has ruled out holding new elections
but said his government might call a referendum if the deal failed to get
sufficient parliamentary support next week.
Mr Rabin has repeatedly said the peace accord must get majority support in
the Knesset without relying on the five Arab votes which make up his
majority. At least 10 other Jewish members of the Knesset, including six MPs
of his coalition partner Shas and one member of the right-wing Likud Party,
are currently wavering between abstention and support.
The Guttman Institute poll found many more Israeli Jews support handing over
the economically decimated Gaza Strip - 81 per cent - than favour giving up
the West Bank town of Jericho, which is backed by 59 per cent.
Furthermore, on sensitive issues likely to dominate future negotiations over
a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the poll showed Israeli Jews
were much less compromising.
Only 11 per cent favour concessions over the status of Jerusalem as a united
city under Israeli jurisdiction and only 20 per cent think Israel should
cede all or part of the rest of the West Bank.
However 63 per cent are satisfied with the government's handling of the
peace process.
The right wing sought to whip up Israeli fears.
The opposition Likud party said: 'The Israeli surrender to the demands of
the murderous PLO won't bring peace to Israel but will only incite more
terrorism and bereavement.'
In an interview broadcast on Israeli television last night Mr Benjamin
Netanyahu, Likud party leader, described yesterday's signing as 'an event of
national humiliation. Arafat is an arch murderer of the most abominable
kind'.

today, it's not so easy, neither for myself as a soldier in Israel's war,
nor for the people of Israel, nor for the Jewish people in the diaspora who
are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension.
'It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the wars,
violence, terror, whose pain will never heal; for the many thousands who
defended our lives in their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our
own. For them, this ceremony has come too late . . .
'We have come from Jerusalem, the ancient and eternal capital of the Jewish
people. We have come from an anguished and grieving land. We have come from
a people, a home, a family that has not known a single year, not a single
month, in which mothers have not wept for their sons . . .
'Let me say to you, the Palestinians, we are destined to live together on
the same soil in the same land . . . We are today giving peace a chance and
saying to you - and saying again to you - enough . . .
'. . . our inner strength, our higher moral values have been derived for
thousands of years from the Book of the Books, in one of which, Koheleth
(Ecclesiastes), we read: 'To every thing there is a season and a time to
every purpose under heaven. A time to be born and time to die, a time to
kill and a time to heal, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to love
and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the time for peace has come.'
PLO chairman Yassir Arafat
'Mr President, I am taking this opportunity to assure you and to assure the
great American people that we share your values for freedom, justice and
human rights - values for which my people have been striving.
'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today marks
the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and suffering which has lasted
throughout this century.
'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today will
usher in an age of peace, co-existence and equal rights. . .
'Now as we stand on the threshold of this new historic era, let me address
the people of Israel and their leaders, with whom we are meeting today for
the first time, and let me assure them that the difficult decision we
reached together was one that required great and exceptional courage.
'We will need more courage and determination to continue the course of
building co-existence and peace between us. This is possible and it will
happen with mutual determination and with the effort that will be made with
all parties on all the tracks to establish the foundations of a just and
comprehensive peace.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: US welcomes Arafat back in from the cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ceremony was set for 11am, but the White House gates opened at 8am, for
those specially invited to witness it, and some were already queuing soon
after 7am to be sure of a good seat. At the head of the queue was a man from
the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac).
Until a few weeks ago that committee, perhaps the most formidable lobbying
organisation in all Washington, would have moved heaven and earth to prevent
the re-election of any senator or congressman foolish enough to suggest a
resumption of official contacts between the US and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, let alone an invitation to the White House for Mr Yassir
Arafat himself, whom most Americans have regarded as the world's
arch-terrorist ever since his famous 'gun-and-olive-branch' appearance at
the United Nations in 1974.
But there was the man from Aipac (after consulting the woman next to him he
declined to give his name) queuing up to get within handshake distance of
the PLO leader, and declaring benignly his support for 'the peace process'.
Later arrivals included most of those who in successive US administrations
have handled that 'process', which has been a principal feature of US
foreign policy under both Republican and Democratic presidents since at
least 1973.
There was Mr Henry Kissinger, who as secretary of state in that year
negotiated the ceasefire at the end of the Yom Kippur war and the
'disengagement of forces' agreements which followed, first between Israel
and Egypt, then - a far tougher affair, requiring a two-month marathon of
shuttle diplomacy - between Israel and Syria. But it was also Mr Kissinger
who in 1975, as part of the price for Israel's partial withdrawal from
Sinai, gave the pledge that the US would never deal with the PLO unless it
first renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist.
There was former President Jimmy Carter, who 15 years ago hosted the
three-week Camp David summit between Egypt's then President Anwar Sadat and
Mr Menachem Begin, Israel's prime minister of the time.
Mr Carter has perhaps as much right as anyone to feel fulfilled by
yesterday's agreement, since it is closely modelled on the Camp David
'framework', which at the time the PLO, along with almost the entire Arab
world outside Egypt, furiously rejected.
He may have reflected with irony that, had the framework been accepted, the
interim period of Palestinian autonomy might have started in 1979 rather
than 1993 or 1994, in which case negotiations on the final status of the
territories should have begun by 1982 and been concluded by 1984.
Yet Mr Carter was bound throughout his administration by the Kissinger
pledge, and so was never able to bring his diplomatic talents directly to
bear on Mr Arafat or other PLO representatives. This thought must yesterday
have been running through the mind of Mr Andy Young, the black American
leader who in 1979 was forced to resign as Mr Carter's representative at the
United Nations after secret contacts between him and the PLO representative
there came to light.
There were Mr Cyrus Vance and Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, respectively secretary
of state and national security adviser in the Carter administration and
frequently at odds over the Middle East as well as over policy towards the
Soviet Union.
There was General Alexander Haig, who as Mr Ronald Reagan's first secretary
of state gave the green light for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982,
and resigned in the midst of the crisis which followed. There was his
successor Mr George Shultz, who in 1988 negotiated the PLO's first explicit
recognition of Israel's right to exist - an essential precondition for
yesterday's agreement.
And there were former President George Bush and his secretary of state, Mr
James Baker, who between them nudged Israel and the Arabs into the peace
conference which began in Madrid the year before last, in the wake of the
Gulf war. They also can take some credit for bringing Mr Rabin to power in
Israel last year. By witholding loan guarantees from Israel they showed for
the first time US support was not unconditional.
Indeed it depended on Israel's willingness to halt the settlement process in
the occupied territories and give up 'land for peace'.

<TEXT>
JORDAN will today announce an 'agenda' or framework for discussions with
Israel. Jordanian officials have stressed that the document is not a peace
agreement but a list of agreed subjects to be tackled in negotiations.
Mr Marwan Muashar, spokesman for the Jordanian delegation at the peace talks
in Washington, said last night: 'It is now final and we will announce (it)
tomorrow.' Jordan's government acknowledges that the agenda has been ready
for endorsement for nearly a year but its unveiling was delayed until the
Palestinians achieved a breakthrough.
The framework is based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and
includes water rights, Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, disputed
land borders, and security issues.
Water has become a pressing issue in Jordan which faces difficulties with
its rapidly expanding population. Accusations that Israel is 'stealing'
water have become customary and the kingdom will be pressing to regain its
share from the Jordan river basin.
Although optimistic of progress, Jordanian officials say they do not expect
negotiations to lead rapidly to a full peace treaty.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Biblical cities the focus for
Palestinian autonomy - Gaza and Jericho will form the nuclei of a future new
Arab entity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEITHER Gaza nor Jericho, which are to be the nuclei of Palestinian
autonomy, rivals Jerusalem in Arab aspirations or in strategic and political
standing.
But their combination in a new Arab entity, flanking Israel under its
internationally recognised borders, is the key factor enabling Mr Yassir
Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, to say he has grasped at
least the outline of a Palestinian state.
The two Biblical cities are on opposite fringes of the tight little country
disputed by Jew and Arab. Jericho is on the Jordan river dividing the
Hashemite Kingdom from pre-1948 Palestine, and Gaza sits on the coast road
linking Egypt with Israel's main population centres.
It is not just a matter of geography. In the armistice agreements which
concluded the war of 1948-9, Jericho and Gaza found themselves controlled by
two rival Arab kingdoms. They became casualties not only of Israel's victory
 -swamped by thousands of restless refug - gees - but also the political
vacuum caused by the their political leaders' fatal extremism.
The Arab states, spurred on by these leaders, had invaded Palestine to
thwart its partition under the United Nations resolution of November 29,
1947. The Jewish state emerged with borders substantially wider than those
drafted by the UN; the rump of Arab Palestine, having spurned co-existence
with a Jewish state, was split between Jordan and Egypt (there was also a
tiny strip controlled by Syria).
In taking over Jericho and Gaza, Transjordan and Egypt at first acted as
though they recognised the Palestinian Arabs as a separate national entity
with rights to independence.
On October 10, 1948, an All-Palestine government - in Gaza - was formed with
the blessing of Egypt and the Cairo-based Arab League. It adopted the
trappings of national sovereignty. Its president was former Jerusalem Mufti
Haj Amin al-Hussaini, Arab Palestine's foremost nationalist leader, who had
led a pre-war revolt against the British and spent much of the second world
war in Berlin. It also had its own prime minister, a cabinet and a national
assembly.
Most Arab countries recognised it. But King Abdullah, whose Arab Legion held
the west Bank, including the Old City of Jerusalem, said he would recognise
no government in Palestine, including Israel's, as long as the land had not
been restored to its inhabitants.
From Jericho he launched his counter bid as protector of Arab Palestine. On
December 1, 1948, the ancient city hosted a congress of Arab notables from
the territories under Abdullah's control. The Jericho assembly declared Emir
Abdullah King of Palestine, and hailed the union of the two banks of the
Jordan as the kernel of a wider Arab unity. Over the next two years, the
process begun at Jericho was consolidated as first the US, and then Britain,
announced de jure recognition of a new Jordanian kingdom embracing
Transjordan and the Palestinian West Bank.
Gaza's pretensions were quickly forgotten. Its All-Palestine government
faded away; some of its leaders left the city almost immediately and its
assembly collapsed after only one meeting. Gaza and its coastal strip became
a fiefdom of the Egyptian army. It was never incorporated into Egypt and its
refugee population was in a state of continuous explosion.
Gaza and Jericho came under the same political administration only when they
were among the territories captured in six days in 1967 by the Israeli army,
under its chief of staff, Lt Gen Yitzhak Rabin, now prime minister.
It was to take another quarter of a century for Palestinians and the
Israelis finally to recognise each other's national credentials.
Jericho and Gaza, once the symbol of Arab Palestine's dismemberment, are now
the twin centres from where it might become the catalyst in transforming the
Middle East from continual warfare to peaceful coexistence. But only if the
fanatics, Arab and Israeli, are kept in check.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Polls show growing support for peace
accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT among Israelis and Palestinians for the peace agreement signed in
Washington is steadily growing, according to a number of opinion polls
published yesterday.
Latest polls show that 62 per cent of Israeli Jews and 65 per cent of
Palestinians support the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord although an even larger
majority on both sides of the 'Green line', which divides Arab and Jew,
support the holding of referendums on the agreement.
In Israel a poll conducted by the Guttman Institute of Applied Social
Research among Israeli Jews found that 62 per cent are in favour of the
Gaza-Jericho deal, a marked increase on last week's 52 per cent. However, 66
per cent would like the government to hold a referendum or new elections.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has ruled out holding new elections
but said his government might call a referendum if the deal failed to get
sufficient parliamentary support next week.
Mr Rabin has repeatedly said the peace accord must get majority support in
the Knesset without relying on the five Arab votes which make up his
majority. At least ten other Jewish members of the Knesset, including six
MPs of his coalition partner Shas and one member of the right-wing Likud
Party, are currently wavering between abstention and support.
The Guttman Institute poll found many more Israeli Jews support handing over
the economically decimated and violence-plagued Gaza Strip - 81 per cent -
than favour giving up the West Bank town of Jericho, which is backed by 59
per cent.
Furthermore, on sensitive issues likely to dominate future negotiations over
a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the poll showed Israeli Jews
were much less compromising.
Only 11 per cent favour concessions over the status of Jerusalem as a united
city under Israeli jurisdiction and only 20 per cent think Israel should
cede all or part of the rest of the West Bank. Only a slim majority of 54
per cent believe Jewish settlement in the occupied territories should be
stopped.
However 63 per cent are satisfied with the government's handling of the
peace process.
In the occupied territories a substantial opinion poll of more than 1,200
Palestinians conducted by the Nablus-based Centre for Palestine Research and
Studies found 65 per cent supported the Gaza-Jericho agreement and 81 per
cent favoured holding a Palestinian referendum.
The survey found 45 per cent felt the agreement would lead to a Palestinian
state and achieve Palestinian rights, 34 per cent did not think so. Opinion
over ending the intifada - the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation - was split with 46.5 per cent in favour and 42.6 per cent
against.
The poll also found that since mutual recognition between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation was concluded last weekend, approval of
the PLO as the legitimate and sole representative of Palestinians had
increased, a large majority were in favour of amending the PLO's founding
covenant which calls for the violent destruction of the Jewish state and a
massive 80 per cent were in favour of democratic dialogue rather than
violence.
Both polls were taken before the upsurge in violence in the occupied
territories which left three Israeli soldiers and a bus driver dead on
Sunday after attacks by Islamic fundamentalist opponents of the peace
agreement. The right wing sought to whip up Israeli fears.
The Likud party said: 'The Israeli surrender to the demands of the murderous
PLO won't bring peace to Israel but will only incite more terrorism and
bereavement.'
However, the government sought to exploit Palestinian violence against
Israelis as proof of the necessity of the peace agreement which provides for
Palestinian policing of Gaza-Jericho.
'These events strengthen the need for an agreement which will oblige the
Palestinian population to join in putting an end to such attacks and
punishing perpetrators,' said Mr Moshe Shalal, police minister.

The following are extracts of speeches made at the White House ceremony

US President Bill Clinton
'A peace of the brave is within our reach. Throughout the Middle East, there
is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life. We know a
difficult road lies ahead. Every peace has its enemies, those who still
prefer the easy habits of hatred to the hard labours of reconciliation . . .
'Together, let us imagine what can be accomplished if all the energy and
ability the Israelis and the Palestinians have invested into your struggle
can now be channelled into cultivating the land and freshening the waters,
into ending the boycotts and creating new industry, into building a land as
bountiful and peaceful as it is holy . . .
'The children of Abraham, the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael, have
embarked together on a bold journey. Together, today, with all our hearts
and all our souls, we bid them Shalom, Salaam, Peace.'

<TEXT>
JORDAN is expected today to conclude an 'agenda' or framework for discussion
with Israel. Jordanian officials have stressed that the document is not a
peace agreement but a list of agreed subjects to be tackled in negotiations.
Jordan's government acknowledges that the agenda has been ready for
endorsement for nearly a year. But its announcement was delayed until the
Palestinians achieved a breakthrough.
The framework is based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and
includes water rights, Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, disputed
land borders, and security issues.
Water has become a pressing issue in Jordan which faces difficulties with
its rapidly expanding population. Accusations that Israel is 'stealing'
water have become customary and the kingdom will be pressing to regain its
share from the Jordan river basin.
Jordanian officials said they sought a settlement based on one mediated by
Mr Eric Johnston, a special envoy of President Eisenhower, between 1953 and
1955. This allocated a 3 per cent share of the Jordan river basin to
Lebanon, 10 per cent to Syria (which never signed the agreement), 31 per
cent to Israel and 56 per cent to Jordan. Although the Johnston plan may be
a basis for discussion, officials in Amman concede that demographic changes
since the 1950s will probably lead to a re-assessment of water needs.
The question of refugees and displaced persons has taken on new impetus now
that Israel has agreed to limited Palestinian autonomy. Mr Adbul Salam
al-Majali, Jordan's prime minister, recently said that the PLO-Israeli
accord, and Jordan's agenda, would entail the repatriation of 246,000
Palestinian displaced persons who entered Jordan in 1967. He said another
3,000 Palestinians who had left the occupied territories since 1968 should
also be reunited.
Publicly, government officials say that Jordan will push for the full rights
of return of all the 1.1m registered displaced persons in the kingdom. But
Israel is unlikely to accept the return of nearly 300,000 refugees who fled
their homes during the 1948 Palestine war. Jordan may thus seek some kind of
compensation.
The agenda also provides for the first Israeli recognition of Jordanian
claims to land held by Israel. This includes a strategic strip of land in
the north which contains the source of the Yarmouk river, and territories in
Wadi Araba which lie between the southern tip of the Dead Sea and the Gulf
of Aqaba.
Jordan supports the idea of free trade with the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
but Israel is calling for restrictions on Jordanian exports which might
enter the Israeli market.
Jordanian officials say they do not expect negotiations to lead rapidly to a
full peace treaty

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the US tyremaker, is to build a Dollars 150m (Pounds
97.4m) joint venture factory in India in one of the largest foreign
investments in the country since economic reform was launched two years ago.
The plan will boost the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister,
which is trying to promote foreign investment through economic
liberalisation.
Foreign companies have secured government approval for projects worth
Dollars 3bn since mid-1991, but only a fraction of these schemes have so far
gone ahead.
Mr Hoyt Wells, Goodyear's president and chief operating officer, said
Goodyear was establishing a 50:50 joint venture with Ceat, a leading Indian
tyre company affiliated to an industrial grouping headed by Mr R P Goenka,
the Calcutta-based entrepreneur.
Subject to government approval, the plant will begin annual production of
500,000 tyres next year, rising to 3m.
Tyres from the plant - to be built at Aurangabad in Maharashtra, western
India - will be sold under both the Goodyear and the Ceat brands through
separate marketing operations. The companies already have factories in India
but decided a new plant on a greenfield site would be the best way to expand
their operations.

Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, has formed a joint
venture with the Xian Aircraft company to manufacture buses in China, writes
Kevin Done.
Volvo said investment in the joint venture, to be called the Xian Silver Bus
Corporation, would total Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m).
The initial target would be to produce 1,000 buses a year, rising to 3,000.
The venture will produce tourist and intercity buses, based on Volvo chassis
and components and with aluminium alloy bodies, for both Chinese and export
markets.

turbines and boilers in Asia, Ian Rodger writes from Zurich.
The new venture, called Japan Gas Turbine, will be 60 per cent owned by ABB
and 40 per cent by KHI. Its products will be based on ABB's latest gas
turbine technology, revealed last week, and will be manufactured and
assembled at KHI plants.
KHI has already built 14 gas turbines under an ABB licence.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Patagonia feels chilly free-market winds: John Barham on the
fierce struggle of a remote Argentine region to survive the rigours of
President Menem's economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATAGONIA is synonymous with desolation and remoteness. Now, in addition to
the daily battle against the elements, its inhabitants are struggling to
survive the rigours of President Carlos Menem's economic policies.
Argentina's experiment with free markets halted hyperinflation and brought
rapid economic growth. But for some outlying regions it has meant increased
unemployment, a dwindling population and rising government deficits.
Patagonia's economy is shrinking as the state which once subsidised the
region withdraws.
Patagonia obsesses Argentines. It is considered a national disgrace that a
region covering a third of the country and containing important natural
resources should remain an empty wilderness more than a century after it was
conquered from Indian tribes.
Although most Argentines prefer the comforts and bright lights of cities,
they admire pioneers who occupy the rough interior. They even have a phrase
 -'hacer patria', literally making the nation - for the defenders of
Argentina's sovereignty in frontier regions.
It is widely believed that foreigners, like the British, who once owned vast
sheep farms in Patagonia, and Chileans covet Patagonia; Argentina and Chile
almost went to war in the south 15 years ago. Chileans comprise a large
minority in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, where they work for low wages in
manual jobs scorned by Argentines.
Patagonia was first settled in 1865 by Welsh and Scottish immigrants who
introduced sheep from the nearby Falkland Islands.
The discovery of oil in 1907 led to the creation of YPF, the world's first
state-owned oil company, in 1922. YPF ran hospitals and schools and provided
jobs. Later, governments offered a cornucopia of subsidies to attract
companies and settlers from the north.
Invoking the threat from Chile, Buenos Aires ran loss-making coal and iron
ore mines, subsidised the creation of textile and consumer electronics
industries and backed an aluminium plant.
Now the state is retreating. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has
turned off the tap of subsidies, privatised YPF in June after it sacked 80
per cent of its employees, and is demanding provincial governments balance
their books, even though local officials claim this would worsen
unemployment, now topping 20 per cent. In the Patagonian province of Santa
Cruz, a tenth of the population works for the government.
The loss of subsidies and import barriers is suffocating the textile
industry. Once-thriving fishing ports are hit by depressed prices and sheep
farming is in terminal decline. Chubut, one of Patagonia's three provinces,
is running a 20 per cent budget deficit.
Mr Eliseo Moledo, who owns a Trelew car parts company, agrees with the
market economy, but there is no local market and 'without a market there can
be no economy'.
Mr Jorge Conrad, Chubut's despairing economy minister, asks: 'If I had a
million dollars, would I invest it in Patagonia?' Hardly pausing he says:
'No. It's better to take the resources than process them here.'
Argentina is a vast country, but a third of its population of 32.4m and much
of its industry is clustered around Buenos Aires. Small companies in the
interior are hobbled by huge distances, poor communications and high
operating costs.
Bureaucrats worry that the provinces may be left behind by Buenos Aires,
widening an already considerable wealth disparity. Mr Cavallo has responded
by inducing the provinces (except those in Patagonia) to cut local taxes and
regulations by offering bigger tax transfers from the centre. He says
lighter tax and regulatory burdens will reactivate dormant economies.
The government claims Buenos Aires-based companies are already relocating to
the interior. Deregulation is unshackling once-moribund mining, tourism, and
energy industries. In Tierra del Fuego, where a previous military government
set up a consumer electronics industry, output of TV sets and VCRs has risen
500 per cent in three years. Cordoba, home to Argentina's car industry, is
thriving.
But supply side policies are no cure. The small northern province of Tucuman
has balanced its books and cut taxes, but the government considers it a
triumph to have kept unemployment flat. Malnutrition, poor education and
declining industries are serious problems.
Patagonia's economy has stagnated even though the rest of the country has
seen 20 per cent growth in the last three years. The regional problem is
emerging as one of the government's critical policy challenges. Overcoming
decline in the interior could well prove harder than crushing
hyperinflation.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Senate wants more cuts in US aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate is planning even deeper cuts in the already dwindling US
contribution to the International Development Association, the World Bank
unit which provides low interest rate loans to the world's poorest
countries.
Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate subcommittee in charge of
foreign aid spending, said yesterday he would cut the US contribution to IDA
for the coming year to Dollars 957m (Pounds 621m).
The House of Representatives had already slashed the contribution to Dollars
1.024bn, itself 20 per cent down from the amount the US had promised -
Dollars 3.75bn over three years - during international negotiations last
year over the replenishment of the IDA fund.
Like the House, the Senate will provide nothing for the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, eliminating the Dollars 70m the US was to
pay this year.
Mr Leahy's full foreign operations bill, expected to be pushed to completion
before the US fiscal year ends on September 30, reflects a severe shrinkage
in US foreign aid.
The aid bill totals Dollars 12.49bn, Dollars 500m lower than the bill passed
by the House and Dollars 2bn less than President Bill Clinton had requested.
Aid programmes have been squeezed even further by the need to accommodate a
request from Mr Clinton in April, after the budget had been submitted, for
an extra Dollars 1.8bn in aid for Russia and the newly independent states of
the former Soviet Union.
The version drafted by Mr Leahy and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the
senior Republican on the subcommittee, provides more flexibility to move
funds to other newly independent republics and away from Russia. It
specifically earmarks Dollars 300m for Ukraine.
Other than the former Soviet Union, the only area to receive more money is
refugee work, where Mr Leahy has marked up Dollars 671m.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Clinton eases sanctions against Vietnam: Trade embargo stays
but president hints at future moves towards relaxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night eased economic sanctions against Vietnam
but refused to lift the trade embargo until Hanoi resolves the issue of US
servicemen missing from the Vietnam War.
In a four-page statement released by the White House, Mr Clinton said the US
would allow American companies to participate in development projects in
Vietnam funded by international financial institutions.
This should ease fears that US taxpayers are funding projects - through the
World Bank - in which US companies are not allowed to participate.
This year the US dropped objections to allowing Vietnam to refinance its
international debts, clearing the way for International Monetary Fund and
World Bank loans. Last year President George Bush allowed US companies to
sign, but not execute, contracts with the Vietnamese.
US businesses are eager for Mr Clinton to allow trade in all but strategic
sectors, before Europeans and others capture the Vietnamese market,
according to Mr John Howard of the US Chamber of Commerce. 'Our members have
long recognised that unilateral sanctions like this only benefit our
competition.'
The main obstacle to lifting the embargo is still the tension about the fate
of US prisoners of war and soldiers 'missing in action' held at the end of
the Vietnamese war.
Last week a document surfaced in Russia suggesting that Vietnam held more
prisoners than it had previously admitted. Vietnam rejected the report, but
it has 'got people shaky again', said one Senate aide.
'There are a lot of people who will never be satisfied' that the Vietnamese
have been open in dealing with the MIA-POW issue, said Ms Kathleen
Bertelsen, an aide with the House subcommittee on economic policy, trade and
environment.
A commission headed by Senator John Kerry that found no evidence that
Vietnam still held US prisoners 'relaxed some members of Congress,' Ms
Bertelsen said. But there would not be wide support in Congress for lifting
the embargo until 'the bulk of (members) feel relatively comfortable that
MIA-POW (representatives) will not come to their town meetings and start
screaming at them.'
Today was the annual deadline for the president to renew the list of
countries with which trade is barred under the US Trading with the Enemy
Act. Several other countries are on the list along with Vietnam.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mexico offers a soft target - Nafta
critics accuse country of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton today begins a formal campaign to win congressional
approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mexico is a
problem.
The president has the backing of ex-US presidents and support from 280 US
economists, including 12 US Nobel laureates. However, silencing critics of
the pact, who say the US has no business integrating its market with a
non-democratic country guilty of corruption and human rights abuses, is
going to be difficult.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Mr Robert Reich, labour
secretary, and Ms Carol Browner, head of the environmental protection
agency, will all bring their persuasive skills before the House ways and
means committee to argue that the pact will create more jobs than it will
cost.
But the administration's efforts, now supported by pro-Nafta television
commercials funded by private-sector backers, have yet to address increasing
scrutiny of Mexico's political system.
'There is a lot of unease that the side agreements (on the environment and
labour) don't address the corruption issue and the chronic abuse of labour
rights and environmental standards,' said Mr John Cavanagh, a fellow with
the anti-Nafta Institute for Policy Studies. 'In the end the side agreements
have very weak enforcement powers.'
Mr Ross Perot is also exploiting the administration's vulnerability on the
corruption issue. The former presidential candidate has hit the air waves
with a scathing attack on the multi-million-dollar pro-Nafta lobby and the
'hired guns' - former US officials - working for a foreign government.
Mexico's one-party rule has been referred to on several occasions by Senator
Pat Moynihan of New York, chairman of the key Senate finance committee who
seems at best an unenthusiastic Nafta backer. Meanwhile, anti-Nafta forces,
led by Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee,
are proposing a Nafta alternative: a common market which would require Latin
American countries to embrace democratic reforms before they could join.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, has not
taken a public position on the pact, but last week he held hearings which
featured testimony about drugs and corruption in the Mexican financial
sector. Mr R Christopher Whalen, a former official in the New York Federal
Reserve, warned of the lack of legal protection for private property and
contracts in Mexico.
The US unions are so hostile to the labour side agreement, which was meant
to pacify them, that the administration fears resources they have reserved
for healthcare reform will be diverted into the anti-Nafta cause.
'Mexican workers cannot defend their own economic interests,' says the
labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'Trade unions independent of
government control are discouraged. The Mexican government intimidates union
leaders and workers who do not toe the government line.'
Nafta opponents are also working closely with anti-government forces in
Mexico. Mr Carlos Heredia, a visiting fellow at the Development Gap, a
progressive policy group, is in Washington for a year because 'I want it to
be known that a pro-democracy movement - opposed to Nafta - exists in
Mexico'. He and others believe Nafta will reinforce the current political
system.
Pro-Nafta forces are left to link free trade, prosperity and democracy. Mr
Harry Freeman, a business lobbyist, says: 'Isolation is not the way to prod
Mexico into democracy and get rid of corruption. There is a higher
probability things will improve with Nafta than without it.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Spain backs France on farm trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, yesterday held
meetings in Washington designed to avert a new round of transatlantic trade
hostilities.
His visit to Washington, where he will receive an award, comes in the wake
of a formal diplomatic protest, delivered by US officials on Friday in
Brussels. They warned that French demands to reopen the Blair House accord
on farm trade, reached last year, could undermine the entire pact.
However, Spain yesterday backed France's opposition to the Blair House
accord, in effect threatening its own veto on this vital building-block for
concluding the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks.
In a memorandum to the European Commission and Spain's EC partners, Mr
Javier Gomez Navarro, the Spanish trade minister, called for a series of
modifications to Blair House which echo some of the main French demands.
The pact's provisions on oilseeds last year averted a trade war, during
which the US was threatening sanctions against EC trade worth up to Dollars
1bn (Pounds 650m). US farm interests believe they made great concessions on
oilseeds in order to get a barely acceptable Uruguay Round deal covering
agriculture.
Spain, like France, wants the 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports to
be spread over longer than six years; to exclude from these cuts added value
food products, food aid, and current EC food stockpiles; and for the cuts to
fall on sectors rather than individual products, thereby allowing the EC to
export more in areas where it either earns most or is most competitive.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi to import glass - Move to end
Japanese market domination after US pressure
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's leading trading house, is to import foreign
sheet glass in an attempt to break domestic manufacturers' domination of the
market.
The move is in response to the sharp appreciation of the yen and mounting
calls from the US for Japan to increase glass imports. A favourable reaction
from domestic wholesalers to trial imports from Pilkington Glass of the UK
and Guardian Industries of the US has accelerated plans.
The imports are expected to erode the market share of Asahi Glass, which
belongs to the Mitsubishi keiretsu, or industrial grouping, Nippon Sheet
Glass and Central Glass, which have dominated the country's construction and
housebuilding glass market. Mitsubishi said the company's interests came
before the keiretsu, reflecting an easing of corporate ties.
Its decision was guided by Mr Makoto Kuroda, senior managing director and a
former senior trade negotiator at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The
deal with Guardian was conducted through one of Mr Kuroda's former
negotiating counterparts at the US trade representative's office, now
working for the Tokyo arm of the US glass maker.
Mitsubishi has ties with Yamada Shoten, a leading domestic glass wholesaler,
and hopes to expand annual sales to Y1.5bn (Pounds 9.1m), or 0.5 per cent of
market share, for the first year. A company spokesman said he expected
imports to gain substantial market share in the future.
Sumitomo Chemical and Nissan Chemical Industries of Japan are to form an
agrochemical development and marketing joint venture with Rhone-Poulenc,
France's largest chemicals company.
The new company will have capital of FFr65m (Pounds 7.4m), with Sumitomo
holding a 60 per cent stake, Nissan a 30 per cent stake, and Rhone-Poulenc
10 per cent.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton must sign an order maintaining the US trade ban
against Vietnam today.
Most analysts say he is unlikely to end the embargo, but congressional
staffers believe he may offer a sign that the US will move toward further
relaxation.
Hindering efforts to lift the embargo are continuing tensions about the fate
of US prisoners of war and 'missing in action' held at the end of the
Vietnamese war.
Last week a document surfaced in Russia suggesting that Vietnam held more

Bertelsen said. But there would not be wide support in Congress for lifting
the embargo until 'the bulk of (members) feel relatively comfortable that
MIA-POW (representatives) will not come to their town meetings and start

Today is the date on which the president must annually renew the list of
countries with which trade is barred under the US Trading with the Enemy

Some elements of the embargo have been relaxed already. Last year President
George Bush allowed US companies to sign, but not execute, contracts with

charges that US taxpayers are funding projects - through the World Bank - in

FT  14 SEP 93 / After the flooding, town votes to move uphill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE residents of Valmeyer in Illinois have voted to move, lock, stock and
barrel, to higher ground rather than risk another flood like the one which
swamped their town this summer.
More than half of the town's 346 homes suffered serious damage during this
year's record flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri basins, and officials
said the ebbing waters left behind a trail of devastation.
One official said about a third of the houses in Valmeyer were still
flooded, but those householders who had been able to enter their homes had
suffered 'extreme shock'.
'It's just totally destroyed,' she said.
The town will now start buying land to the east, and could start building
next spring. Valmeyer has entered a federal government buy-out programme in
which the government would pay homeowners whose properties have suffered
more than 50 per cent damage to relocate, rather than rebuild in the same
vulnerable place.
Valmeyer is not the first town to decide that it was not worth staying in
the flood plain. Soldiers Grove, in Wisconsin, moved after a devastating
flood of the Kickapoo River in 1978.
The administration has urged government agencies to consider other
approaches to limiting future flood damage than simply rebuilding flood
walls and levees. Such alternative approaches could include moving or
turning vulnerable farmlands into safety valve wetlands.
Environmentalist groups, such as American Rivers, have welcomed this new
approach, saying levees along the Mississippi forced it higher than it would
otherwise have gone.
Nevertheless, most of the flood-walls and levees built and managed by the
federal government, under the auspices of the Army Corps of Engineers, are
likely to be rebuilt.

Hurricane Lydia, gusting at up to 125 mph, was yesterday headed towards
Mexico's Pacific coast, threatening flimsy homes and poor neighbourhoods
from Tepic to Los Mochis, AP reports from Mexico City.
The National Water Commission, which tracks storms, said on Sunday the
hurricane was 'extremely dangerous' and issued an alert for coastal areas
400 miles south of the US border.
Thousands fled their homes as Lydia lashed the west coast of Mexico early
yesterday with strong winds and heavy rain.
Officials in the state of Sinaloa were evacuating residents from low-lying
areas in anticipation of heavy flooding. Police said an estimated 30,000
people in the Mazatlan area left their homes on Sunday night as the storm
approached.

THE president of Venezuela, Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez, has called for a
national accord to ensure economic development and political stability,
writes Joseph Mann from Caracas.
Speaking in Venezuela's capital, Mr Velasquez warned that the accord must be
reached over the next few months, if a new president, to be elected on
December 5, was to have enough support in Congress to continue with
essential economic reforms.
The accord would be similar to Mexico's 'social pact', with Venezuelan
political parties, organised labour and business agreeing a set of economic
and social goals.
The president added that a reform of Venezuela's 1961 constitution was
necessary, and called for establishing the post of prime minister, a double
round of voting for president, and greater power for state and municipal
governments, in a country where presidential power has always been dominant.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Madrid on course to hit 4.5% inflation target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government believes it is on target to meet its revised 1993
inflation forecast of 4.5 per cent after figures for August, released
yesterday, showed prices rose just 0.6 per cent.
The August figure is 1.2 percentage points below that of August 1992, when
new value added tax charges came into force. The annualised rate of
inflation in July was 4.9 per cent.
The slow downward trend, caused largely by recession, will be a relief to
the government, which yesterday began formal talks with trade unions and
employers over pensions and unemployment benefits designed to secure union
co-operation in lowering public deficits and wage inflation.
The lower inflation figure will be particularly helpful as a reference
during discussions in the next few days over the way the government
calculates state pensions. Madrid, alarmed at the growth of pension outlays,
has said it wants next year to base pension increases on its forecast for
1994 inflation and not on the 1993 figure.
The unions are wary and have begun to insist on a 'realistic' target for
next year, as the government's forecasts are usually over-optimistic. The
government wants to have the pensions talks completed before the 1994 draft
budget gets to parliament on September 20 and yesterday's inflation figure
will help centre them on a figure close to 4 per cent.
Nevertheless, economists close to the Bank of Spain say the easing in
inflation is unlikely to lead to further quick cuts in interest rates, which
are at historically low levels already. The central bank is waiting to take
the budget's measure and to see whether, as promised, vital talks on wage
moderation get under way in October.
Madrid originally intended to win agreement on wages before discussing
pensions and unemployment benefits with the unions. But the reverse has
happened.
The unions have won an important political concession. By negotiating
pensions and benefits, issues the government has in the past been content to
issue decrees on, they are being drawn back into the shaping of national
policy from which they have been excluded since Spain joined the EC in 1986.
Analysts say the return of political responsibility to the unions should
make agreement on labour market reform and a three-year wage moderation
package relatively easy after the budget has been presented.
The long-term consequences of unions returning to policy-making are still
difficult to discern, however, but some analysts worry that the government
and the previously hostile unions have managed to begin talking to each
other with such ease. They say the resulting agreements may be compromises
outside the tough fiscal and wage constraints the markets have been
insisting on.

FT  14 SEP 93 / France calls up trouble-shooter Trichet: The new Bank of
France governor is a man who appears to enjoy a challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Claude Trichet, who was officially appointed yesterday as the new
governor of the Bank of France, seems to be drawn to crises.
His steady climb up the ladder of France's financial administration has
placed him in the hot seat on several occasions. In 1981, as deputy director
of international affairs in the Treasury, he faced the challenge of managing
France's interests in the Latin American debt crisis. In August 1987, he was
appointed director of the Treasury and was soon dealing with the
implications of the international stock market crash.
True to form, he takes over at the head of the French central bank at a
difficult time. This summer's currency crisis, which widened the franc's
fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent
to 15 per cent, broke the French currency's close link with the D-Mark - the
centrepiece of France's monetary policy. It leaves Mr Trichet and the
government of Mr Edouard Balladur with the task of deciding what is French
policy in the new European monetary order.
The task is complicated by pressures from French businessmen and
politicians, even within Mr Balladur's Gaullist RPR party, for the reversal
of the Bank of France's anti-inflationary stance and the implementation of
more expansionist policies to revive the recession-hit economy.
Proponents of an alternative policy to a strong franc and financial
discipline are, however, unlikely to take any comfort from Mr Trichet's
appointment. Like his predecessor, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Mr Trichet has
been an unswerving advocate of financial rigour. An amateur poet, he is
expected to stick to his lines.
'He has been one of the principal architects of current policy,' says Mr
Jean-Luc Parodi, professor of politics at the Institut des Etudes Politiques
de Paris.
Mr Trichet's orthodox views partly reflect his background and his experience
in the French administration. A graduate of the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, the training ground for many of France's top officials, Mr
Trichet has worked his way up France's financial hierarchy. In 1985 he was
appointed director of international affairs at the Treasury and the
following year he became chief adviser to Mr Balladur, then the French
economics minister.
But those who have worked with him say his stance is also based on
conviction. 'Like Mr Balladur, he believes that France cannot return to the
days when the financial authorities resorted to devaluations to ease the
problems facing the economy,' says one French banker.
In fighting his corner, the new governor will soon have a strengthened hand.
A reform of the law to grant independence to the central bank is expected to
be implemented by the end of the year. Under the new laws, the central bank
will be granted autonomy in monetary policy.
How autonomous Mr Trichet appears will be the yardstick for his success in
his new job. 'The French government might have sent a stronger signal by
naming a more independent-looking figure,' said one Paris-based diplomat,
referring to Mr Trichet's background in the Treasury and his links with Mr
Balladur.
It is a sentiment echoed by some senior European officials who have
negotiated with Mr Trichet. 'He is very charming and intelligent and has
shown his mettle in his work for the Paris Club and Group of Seven,' one
monetary official commented. 'But you have to realise that French officials,
even at the very, very highest level operate under very, very firm
instructions from whoever is in political control.'
Nor has Mr Trichet always been a strong advocate of central bank
independence. It is not so many years since visitors to his office in the
Treasury would be treated to strong criticism of the idea.
The real test of his independence, however, may come in his attitude towards
the Bundesbank rather than the French government. Since the ERM reforms at
the beginning of August, the Bank of France has continued to be guided by
German monetary policy and the franc/D-Mark rate.
It was only after last week's cut in German interest rates, for example,
that France completed its return to pre-crisis levels of official interest
rates by cutting the 5-to-10 day borrowing rate from 10 per cent to 7.75 per
cent. The more important intervention rate was left unchanged at 6.75 per
cent.
For the short term at least, the Bank of France is likely to continue to
edge interest rates downwards, following the lead of the Bundesbank and with
a careful eye on the value of the franc, which now appears to have a target
range of between FFr3.50 and FFr3.55 to the D-Mark.

<TEXT>
THE Balladur government appears to be weighing possible changes at the top
of the country's largest bank, Credit Lyonnais, and the largest insurance
company, Union des Assurances de Paris, to speed their eventual
privatisation.
According to an identical leak appearing in five newspapers yesterday - on
which the prime minister's office subsequently refused all comment  - the
government plans to exploit the expiry next month of the three-year term of
Mr Yves Lyon-Caen, the socialist-appointed head of Credit National, to set
in train a small bout of musical chairs.
Credit National has the very peculiar feature - even for France - in that
because it was set up in 1919 with the public service function of repairing
war damage its top three officers are public appointees, even though the
bank is privately-owned.
The government apparently intends to give the job of Mr Lyon-Caen (whose
previous association with Mr Michel Rocard ensures also that he does not
have President Mitterrand's support either) to the socialist-appointed Mr
Jean-Yves Haberer to save his face on leaving Credit Lyonnais.
Controversy has surrounded Mr Haberer's management of Credit Lyonnais, which
lost FFr1.9bn (Pounds 210m) in the second half of 1992 and recorded a
reduced loss in the first six months of this year. But Mr Haberer, whose
current mandate expires next June, is understood to have so far resisted
being prematurely moved on to an institution one-tenth the size of Credit
Lyonnais.
If he moves on, Mr Jean Peyrelevade has been slotted to move from UAP to
Credit Lyonnais - though the insurance chief denied the possibility
yesterday - and Mr Jacques Friedmann, who is a close friend of Mr Balladur
and architect of the 1980s privatisation programme, would move to UAP.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Hungary reveals banking fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRIMINAL inquiries into Hungarian banks have uncovered Dollars 170m (Pounds
110m) to Dollars 190m of losses due to fraud, negligence, bribery and other
offences, the chief prosecutor's office has announced.
Under investigation are 42 cases covering the spectrum of financial crime.
In several instances, bank managers are alleged to have accepted bribes to
underscore credit risk, overlook fake security, or grant preferential loans.
In the largest single case, the authorities are taking action against the
management of Ybl Bank, a private bank, which collapsed last year, for
misuse of Ft6bn (Pounds 41m) of deposits.
Explaining the proliferation of corruption, Mr Ivan Szabo, the Hungarian
finance minister, blamed the spread of the black economy, which some
estimates put at 25 per cent of gross domestic product.
Most of the cases are old ones which have simply taken time to work their
way through a creaky legal system, officials emphasise, and they have
downplayed the significance of bank corruption.
The latest burst of media interest in the problems of Hungarian banks comes
as a World Bank delegation is in Budapest to consider help for a financial
sector laden with bad loans.
Nevertheless, the Budapest authorities remain confident that the World Bank
will grant a loan of Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m to help recapitalise
Hungary's commercial banks. A World Bank report earlier this year found some
banks 'technically insolvent according to international accounting
standards'.
Bankers pointed out that a more significant problem for banks, though not a
legal one, is represented by discretionary lending by local bank managers:
central reporting systems are only now being introduced.
The inquiries into bank fraud have contributed to increasing public
suspicion that corruption is widespread.

Mr Trichet's departure from the head of the Treasury, has prompted a
reshuffle at the top of France's financial administration. His post is to be
taken by Mr Christian Noyer, the director of Mr Alphandery's private office,
John Ridding reports.
Mr Noyer, 42, has a similar background to Mr Trichet, who is 50. Both are

REBEL Serb forces in Croatia yesterday launched heavy artillery attacks on
the Croat town of Karlovac, fuelling fears that fighting could escalate in
the Serb-controlled Krajina region of Croatia.
The rocket and artillery attacks, 50km south west of the Croat capital,
Zagreb, came as rebel Serb forces threatened to launch an all-out assault in
response to a Croat offensive in Krajina last week.
UN officials in Zagreb yesterday confirmed that heavy artillery attacks were
continuing by both sides across Krajina, leaving the area more tense than at
any time since the ceasefire agreed by the rebel Serbs and Croat at the
beginning of 1992.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, UN special envoy in Yugoslavia, yesterday strongly
condemned the attacks and appealed to both sides to show restraint.
Some 6,000 rocket and artillery strikes on Croatian territory had been
recorded since the latest outbreak of fighting in Krajina - a figure which
is far heavier than the current level of fighting in Bosnia, UN officials
said.
Meanwhile, in another sign of the pressures now mounting on the Croat
leadership, the Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, is to meet his
Bosnian counterpart, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, today in Geneva to discuss access
to the sea for the Moslem republic proposed in the carve-up of Bosnia.
The Bosnian Croats' refusal to concede Mr Izetbegovic's demand for territory
extending to the Adriatic sea was a prime cause of the breakdown of the
Bosnian peace talks a fortnight ago.
The meeting comes as the 30-strong steering committee for the international
conference on former Yugoslavia holds its own discussions in Geneva on the
state of the Bosnian negotiations, and separate mediation efforts between
the Croatian government and rebel Serbs in Croatia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers yesterday vowed to press on with the Maastricht
timetable for economic and monetary union, and called on the European
Commission to make its forthcoming White Paper on competitiveness and
employment in the Community a real instrument for job-creation.
In a televised debate on Community economic and monetary policy, ministers
easily agreed that the jobs crisis was now top of the EC agenda, but showed
little uniformity in identifying solutions.
Mr Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which holds the EC
presidency, underlined the general agreement that EC credibility hinged on
starting stage two of Emu on time next January, and on offering realistic
solutions to unemployment.
All participants in the lacklustre debate backed his call for tighter
macroeconomic and monetary co-ordination, and for no let-up in attempts to
control budget deficits and inflation.
As Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, put it, 'the foundations for
Emu are the same as those for growth: sound and convergent economies
operating a completed internal market.'
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economic affairs commissioner, warned that
currency instability would wreck Europe's single market and bottle up
cross-border investment. Most ministers agreed job creation would need more
flexible labour markets, a re-examination of taxes and social security
charges on employment and wage moderation. But practical interpretation of
this varied sharply.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, for instance, stressed the need to
shift taxes on employment on to resources, calling for the EC to press ahead
with its stalled energy tax plan.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for the removal of
'all unnecessary and damaging controls on business activity', in line with
the UK's submission to the White Paper debate calling for the dismantling of
much actual and planned EC social legislation, and fuller labour market
deregulation. Mr Jean Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance (and employment)
minister, said 'frenetic deregulation' was not the way to boost EC
credibility, and that 'we can not take on the Asian model'.
Several member states from Denmark to Portugal emphasised the need to
preserve Europe's 'model' of social provision.
UK officials nevertheless sense the debate is moving their way, and Mr
Clarke said afterwards that 'what would be a complete waste of time would be
for the Commission to emerge with something as if the member-states'
contributions (to the White Paper debate) had never been made.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Belgian and Portuguese central banks reduce short-term
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central banks of Belgium and Portugal slightly reduced their short-term
interest rates yesterday, following the Bundesbank's cut in its
internationally sensitive discount rate last week, writes James Blitz.
However, the French authorities surprised some dealers by keeping their
official rates unchanged.
Belgium cut its end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12 per cent,
having last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point and its
central rate by  1/4 of a percentage point. Portugal reduced its emergency
lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent.
Both moves followed the  1/2 percentage point cut in the German discount
rate to 6.25 per cent last week. They were accompanied by sharp
appreciations of both currencies. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.23
against the D-Mark from a previous BFr21.47 and the escudo at Es101.58 from
Es102.38.

GERMANY may appeal to the European Court of Justice after EC finance
ministers yesterday voted 11-1 in favour of a new Community-wide bank
deposit guarantee scheme.
Bonn government officials made no effort to hide their disappointment over
adoption of the new scheme, which falls short of Germany's unlimited
protection for bank account holders.
Mr Christoph Zeitler, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry, said
the new bank deposit directive was 'unjust and unfair'.
A German diplomat described the scheme as 'anti-competitive'.
Under the new directive the EC would require banks to raise protection to 90
per cent on the first Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,320), starting January 1 1995.
There is, however, a five-year transition period under which member states
can limit the guarantee to Ecu15,000. Germany's objections centre on the
difficulties of safeguarding its own generous privately managed compensation
scheme if foreign bank subsidiaries which operate in the country elect to
join.
'It is a matter of supervision,' said one official.
Bonn also argues that its own banks should be able to use their superior
investor protection as a competitive weapon when operating elsewhere in the
EC.
However, the directive expressly applies only to 'topping up' and not
lowering protection.
The new EC bank directive covers deposits in EC banks which are denominated
in EC currencies and Ecus. Member states would be free to oblige
third-country banks to join the scheme
Agreement on the scheme paves the way for similar arrangements to increase
cover for investors in stocks and shares. which would mark a further step
towards completing the single European market.
Separately, ministers agreed to release the second tranche of an Ecu8bn
balance of payments loan to Italy.
The budgetary goal set by the Rome government for 1993 was likely to be met,
they said.
Ministers welcomed Italy's emphasis on spending controls in the 1994 budget
but warned that 'there is still a need for additional budgetary efforts to
meet the 1994 targets'.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, has emerged as the consensus
EC candidate for chairmanship of the IMF interim committee, vacated by Mr
Carlos Solchaga, the former Spanish finance minister.
But Mr John Dawkins, Australian finance minister, is also said to be in the
running.

MR Werner Niefer, 65, died at the weekend less than four months after he
retired from a career at Daimler-Benz which spanned 50 years.
Mr Niefer, who was known in Germany as 'Mister Mercedes', started with the
company as a toolshop apprentice in 1943.
He worked his way up to be appointed deputy group chairman in 1987, and
reached his career peak two years later when he was put in charge of the
group's supporting pillar, Mercedes-Benz. Mr Niefer played a key role in the
restructuring of production facilities after the takeover of
aero-engineering and electrical and electronics interests such as Dornier,
MTU and AEG.
During the late 1980s Mr Niefer enhanced his reputation as a 'doer', acting
as right-hand man to Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, who has dedicated his
term of office to transforming Daimler into a broad-based technology group.
More recently, Mr Niefer, a self-confessed old-fashioned, shirt-sleeved
manager operating often by 'gut feelings', was quicker than some to
recognise the dangers facing German auto makers.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Norwegian Election: EC issue sways Norway vote - Labour
party set to remain in power as minority government

NORWAY'S Labour party last night tightened its hold on power as a minority
government after increasing its vote in the general election. But with 89
per cent of the votes counted, results also showed strong resistance to
Norway's application to join the European Community, signalling a big
problem for Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister, as she seeks to turn
public opinion in favour of membership.
The most spectacular gains in the election yesterday were made by the
agrarian Centre party, which based its campaign on uncompromising opposition
to the EC.
Computer projections showed the party, led by Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, more
than doubling its vote and overtaking the Conservative party as the largest
opposition group in the 165-member Storting (parliament).
The projections showed the Centre party, which won 11 seats in the last
election in 1989, increased its representation to 31, its best-ever result,
with 19 per cent of the vote. The Conservatives, meanwhile, suffered their
worst setback for 20 years, losing nine of 37 seats, with 15 per cent of the
vote. The right-wing Progress party, which supports EC membership, fell
sharply and was set to lose half its 22 seats.
'This is a demand from the people that we continue the fight against EC
membership,' said Ms Lahnstein, popularly known as the 'No Queen'.
Labour, with 37 per cent of the vote, was projected to win 67 seats, a gain
of four, due mainly to an improving economy and insistence that EC
membership will be decided by a referendum, not the election. Mrs Brundtland
said before the poll she would seek support on most issues except the EC
from the Socialist Left party or the Centre party. The Socialist Left, which
is anti-EC, was projected as losing four seats, to hold 13.
Final results were expected to be delayed because of a breakdown in the
computerised voting system in Oslo. Officials said a count from the capital
would not be completed until later today at the earliest, and another vote
might have to be called.
A senior Labour leader said a clear anti-EC result in the election would
harden the government's already tough stance in accession negotiations with
the Community begun earlier this year, particularly over the sensitive
issues of fishing and oil.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday spelt out law and order and economic
security as the twin themes of his campaign for re-election as German
chancellor next year.
In a broad-ranging restatement of his vision of a unified Germany in the
international community - anchored in the European Community and the Nato
alliance - he denounced the rise of right-wing violence as a threat to
Germany's internal order, as well as its international image.
At the same time he insisted that Germans should not be ashamed of asserting
their national identity within a united Europe. Patriotism must not be
abandoned as a preserve of the extremists, he warned.
In his keynote address to the annual conference of his Christian Democratic
Union, the principal party in the ruling German coalition, Mr Kohl hammered
home his other major election theme: the need for far-reaching reforms of
Germany's education system, working practices and social security, to ensure
the international competitiveness of the German economy.
It was a speech intended to appeal to the broad middle ground of German
politics, a denunciation of extremes in all their forms, and a thoughtful
analysis of the biggest challenges facing German society in the wake of
unification.
It contained by far the strongest denunciation he has yet voiced of
right-wing extremism, racist violence, and the rise of new neo-Nazi splinter
groups.
It was also an impressive restatement of Mr Kohl's conviction that German
unification and European unification are two sides of a single coin.
Yet it was not the rabble-rousing address at the start of a marathon
election year which the party faithful wanted.
It was a statesmanlike speech, not a party-political broadcast, and the
1,000 CDU delegates in Berlin's echoing international congress centre
received it politely but without obvious enthusiasm.
The Chancellor was undaunted. His popularity may be low, and he may fail to
inspire any standing ovations, but he is supremely confident of his position
as the architect of unification, as the dominant figure on the political
scene, and as the only chancellor-candidate the CDU has got.
'At a time of sweeping change, the people need direction and stability,' he
declared. 'The people want security. We are the ones who take their worries
seriously.'
He spelt out his firm commitment to the current ruling coalition - with the
Bavaria-based Christian Social Union and the liberal Free Democratic Party -
and by implication, a rejection of suggestions that a grand coalition with
the opposition Social Democrats would be preferable.
At a time of uncertainty, he implied, the voters would stick to the devil
they knew, and that meant Helmut Kohl as chancellor.
His vision of economic security did not mean 'fortress Germany,' he said.
It meant reform of Germany's entrenched labour practices and of its
excessively academic and over-long education system, to ensure
competitiveness.
He warned that financing of the social security and pensions system must be
reviewed to cope with an ageing population.
His emphasis on law and order is a clear response to voters' concerns,
currently driving the election campaign in Hamburg, where both the CDU and
SPD are fearful of a rise of the far right in next Sunday's poll.
For once, he pulled no punches in his condemnation of the extreme right.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Belgium and Portugal shave rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central banks of Belgium and Portugal slightly reduced their short-term
interest rates yesterday, following the Bundesbank's cut in its
internationally sensitive discount rate last week.
However, the French authorities surprised some dealers by keeping their
official rates unchanged.
Belgium cut its end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12.00 per
cent, having last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point and
its central rate by  1/4 of a percentage point. Portugal reduced its
emergency lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent.
Both moves followed the  1/2 percentage point cut in the German discount
rate to 6.25 per cent last week. They were accompanied by sharp
appreciations of both currencies. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.23
against a previous BFr21.47 and the escudo at Es101.58 compared with
Es102.38. Nevertheless, the Bank of France disappointed market dealers by
keeping the intervention rate - which marks the effective floor for all
French rates - at 6.75 per cent. This is a 1/2 percentage point above its
German counterpart.
The decision not to ease surprised some dealers, because the sharp
appreciation of the French franc against the D-Mark yesterday would have
given the Bank of France a good opportunity. The Bank of France may be
concerned by the severe depletion of French currency reserves.
Investors have not forgotten, either, that France's attempts to push
short-term rates below Germany's early in the summer failed to trigger a
rise in the French currency. Aggressive cuts by France may even have
contributed to the crisis which forced apart the exchange rate mechanism's
bands on August 2.

Last year, for example, he pushed through the first painful phase of a

However, he was also progenitor of the latest S-Class Mercedes, a so-called
'cathedral on wheels' which was in the old tradition of the marque, and was
damned in the German media for being out of touch with modern consumer
demands. His other main projects at the company, including a new Mercedes
mini-car and the German concern's first production plant in the United
States, are now the responsibility of Mr Helmut Werner, who took charge in
May.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Handshake seals Mideast deal: Jordan and Israel will today
agree on framework for peace and land negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat yesterday sealed with a symbolic
handshake on the lawns of the White House the greatest breakthrough in the
Middle East conflict for 14 years, and pledged a new era of peace.
Yesterday's momentous occasion will be followed today with a declaration by
Jordan and Israel on the framework for peace talks.
The agenda provides for the first Israeli recognition of Jordanian claims to
land held by Israel. Similar agreements between Israel, Lebanon and Syria
are also under negotiation but are some way from conclusion, although all
parties at yesterday's signing are united in an effort to sustain the
momentum towards a comprehensive settlement.
The Israeli prime minister and the leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, decades-long adversaries who met yesterday for the first time,
had watched in the brilliant morning sunshine as Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister, and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO executive committee member,
signed a short text outlining an agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule.
Both men signed two sets of documents, laid open on the 124-year-old table
on which Israel completed its first peace deal with a neighbour, Egypt, in
1979. The presidential author of that deal, the Camp David agreement, Mr
Jimmy Carter, looked on smiling from the front row of dignitaries seated on
the lawns.
'We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you in a loud
and clear voice - enough of blood and tears. Enough]' Mr Rabin declared to
applause after the signing, in a sombre speech that evoked the suffering of
Israelis throughout the Holocaust and over the decades of conflict with the
Palestinians. 'The time for peace has come.'
Mr Arafat, wearing a khaki military uniform and keffiyeh headdress, speaking
in Arabic, replied: 'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are
signing today marks the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and
suffering which has lasted throughout this century.'
He said he hoped the outline agreement would 'usher in an age of peace,
co-existence and human rights'. After the signings, President Bill Clinton
shook the hands of both leaders, flanking him on the small pavilion built
for the signing.
A smiling Mr Arafat then offered his hand to Mr Rabin, who accepted it,
grave-faced, to a cheer from the previously hushed audience of 3,000 guests.
The Israeli prime minister had said before yesterday's signing that he would
shake hands with his former foe only 'if necessary'.
The rows of seated guests, some of whom had queued to enter the White House
from 7am for the 11am ceremony, included the entire US Congress, former US
presidents Mr Carter and Mr George Bush and scores of diplomats, lobbyists
and former foreign ministers who, in the words of Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, 'had toiled for decades in the search for peace in the
Middle East'.
Hundreds of yards away, beyond the White House garden railings, big crowds
of Jewish protesters, almost all wearing wide-brimmed black hats,
demonstrated throughout the ceremony, bearing posters saying 'Israel is in
danger' and 'Rabin resign'. A tiny clutch of Arab opponents to the peace
deal gathered a block away.
But there was little to trouble the low-key but intensive security ring
around the ceremony - the biggest open gathering of notables in Washington
since President Clinton's inauguration.
Mr Peres and Mr Abbas also emphasised the potentially historic nature of the
accord signed yesterday which, although only a declaration of understanding
to guide further negotiations, represents for the first time direct
negotiations between Israel and the main representatives of the Palestinian
people.
Mr Clinton, in a speech borrowing from both history and the scriptures,
thanked the many of those in the audience who had worked for decades for
just such a breakthrough as yesterday's. He said: 'A peace of the brave is
within our reach. Throughout the Middle East there is a great yearning for
the quiet miracle of a normal life.'
Mr Christopher added: 'This Israeli-Palestinian agreement cannot be
permitted to fail.' He pledged that the US 'will spare no effort to enable
the parties to turn agreements at the table to agreements on the ground'.
Mr Clinton offered specific thanks to the government of Norway, through
whose secret good offices the deal was hammered out.
After the euphoria of the ceremony, Mr Peres and Mr Rabin underlined the
difficulty of the task facing both sides. 'We are happy with the success, we
are not drunken with the estimation of what lies ahead of us,' Mr Peres told
reporters. He said both he and Mr Rabin were 'determined to continue and go
ahead' with the negotiations, but added: 'For the prime minister of Israel
today it was a most unusual challenge to penetrate the thickest
psychological wall in the Middle East. You must understand it. It wasn't
easy for him; it wasn't easy for me.'
Later, Mr Clinton held an unexpected private meeting with Mr Arafat during
which officials said he impressed on the PLO chairman the need to implement
the new agreement as swiftly as possible. According to an aide, Mr Clinton
made the point 'with some emphasis' that the Palestinians needed to 'seize
the moment'.
Mr Rabin and Mr Peres were expected to fly directly back to Jerusalem for
the start of the Jewish New Year festival. Mr Arafat stayed on to 'work'
Washington and was expected to attend more meetings today.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Joyous Palestinians dance in the streets of Jericho

JOYOUS Palestinians hung out flags, honked car horns and danced in the
streets of the Israeli-occupied territories yesterday.
The celebration of what they said was their 'first day of independence' on
their long march to statehood was marred only by isolated incidents of
tyre-burning by opponents of the treaty and clashes in Lebanon in which
seven demonstrators died.
Guerrilla songs and the Palestinian anthem were sung in Jericho's crowded
town square, which burst into uproar when Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman,
were shown on television shaking hands.
Children in the Gaza Strip handed out balloons in the red, green, white and
black colours of the Palestinian standard and more than 50,000 people poured
into the rubbish-strewn streets of Gaza banging drums, laughing and talking
to Israeli soldiers with whom they have clashed for nearly six years.
Thousands of flags, still technically banned by Israel, emerged from under
mattresses and cupboards to be hung from roofs, car bonnets and bicycle
handlebars. Posters of Mr Arafat emerged across the West Bank and Gaza,
including one depicting him being plucked by a celestial eagle from an
aircraft which crashed in the Libyan desert two years ago, killing others
aboard.
Police and soldiers kept a low profile and there was only one report of
minor violence between Palestinians for and against the agreement. But in
Gaza, Palestinians and Islamic fundamentalists who reject the peace accord
mounted a general strike until mid-afternoon and set tyres ablaze on the
roads.
There were clashes in Beirut where Lebanese troops shot dead seven
pro-Iranian militants and Palestinian refugees demonstrating against the
peace agreement. A further 31 people were wounded when soldiers opened fire
on demonstrators in Beirut's southern suburbs.
In Israel, where the public largely supports the peace agreement but remains
sceptical and concerned about its long-term effect on Jewish security, a few
hundred pro-peace demonstrators draped in the blue and white Israeli flag
danced in Jerusalem. About 50 rightwing opponents of the deal, some in
sackcloth and ashes, said prayers of mourning and burnt the Palestinian
flag.
Israelis said the atmosphere in Jerusalem was much more sombre than in 1978
when joy erupted after Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David peace accord.

FT  14 SEP 93 / BT pushes on with plan for videos via phone lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM is pushing ahead with proposals to launch a national
video-on-demand service via telephone lines. The venture might cost several
billion pounds.
Video-on-demand is a system by which consumers can order films from a
database and have them relayed to their TV set, while the telephone can
still be used for talking.
A network to deliver programmes or other services is already on the drawing
board and exploratory talks have been held with several Hollywood studios
and other owners or brokers of entertainment rights.
The aim would be to launch a service competing with video shops, cable and
satellite television as early as next year.
A decision on whether to go ahead is expected next month. Several senior
executives are believed to be enthusiastic about taking BT into the new
business.
The system can deliver anything from films and television programmes to
catalogues or holiday information on demand from either a large national or
a number of regional databases.
The film or programme is shown in 'real time' via the telephone lines, but
the signal has to be digitally compressed. Decoders would therefore be
needed in the home for the service.
If BT goes ahead, there will inevitably be questions as to whether the
company has the legal right to run such a service.
US telephone companies such as Nynex and Southwestern Bell, which are
investing millions of pounds in developing cable franchises in the UK, are
expected to challenge BT in the courts through the Cable Television
Association.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable and satellite at the Independent Television
Commission, said yesterday that BT could almost certainly get a programme
licence for its service. It was less clear whether the telephone company
would need a local-delivery licence under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to
retail programme services. Mr Davey said: 'If a (local-delivery) licence is
needed, it effectively stops BT.' Such licences are not given in areas
already franchised for cable television. Under the Duopoly Review of March
1991, BT is not allowed to move into cable television for at least 10 years.
The attraction of such a venture, if the regulatory hurdles can be overcome,
is that BT would be able to offer a service to a high proportion of the 23m
homes in the UK. On average, telephones are in use less than 1 per cent of
the time.
BT accepts that there would be some picture degradation the further a
subscriber was away from the local telephone exchange. Critics say parts of
the BT network are too old to carry watchable pictures.
At least at the outset, BT would probably solely operate the network for a
fee for other commercial interests.

<TEXT>
NORWEGIANS today vote in a general election which is expected to hand
victory to the ruling Labour party led by Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland.
Opinion polls have consistently indicated a swing to the left, a trend
confirmed by a poll published on Saturday in the Dagbladet newspaper. The
poll, the last before the election, showed Labour with 34.8 per cent of the
vote, a marked improvement from mid-year polls when support for Labour fell
below 30 per cent, its poorest rating since the 1920s.
The major issues of the election include unemployment, currently at a
post-war record of 8.3 per cent, including those on government training
schemes, and Norway's application to join the European Community.
Labour's strength in the polls has been boosted by signs of economic
recovery, assisted by record North Sea petroleum output which has made
Norway Europe's biggest oil producer.
Mrs Brundtland has also gained credibility by refusing to debate Europe
during the campaign, saying that EC membership will be decided by voters in
a referendum by 1995.
Analysts say the electorate feels there is no real credible alternative to
Labour, with opinion polls showing steadily eroding support for the main
opposition Conservative Party.
In Saturday's poll, the Conservatives saw support fall to 18.1 per cent from
22.2 per cent of the vote in the 1989 election.
The biggest gain today, according to the polls, will be by the anti-EC
agrarian Centre party, support for which has soared to 16 per cent from just
6.5 per cent in the last election.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Russians welcome German business invasion: A new spirit of
co-operation between the two nations on the enterprise front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRONIES never absent when Germans meet Russians on their own soil were
on full display in Nizhny Novgorod this week when delegations of German
businessmen and politicians came to Russia's most market-oriented region to
advise, to learn and to do business.
Mr Heinz Rhunau, former chairman of Lufthansa and now deeply engaged in
assistance to the Nizhny region, says that 'I am happy that I can come here
and talk to him (embracing his translator) without a rifle in my hand'.
Outside the administration building where he has been meeting the region's
leaders, a war memorial exhorts - 'Comrades, remember the life of those who
left us ..they fell, for honour and freedom, for the motherland. Think on
this down the centuries, as you walk beside them.'
Mr Rhunau, of an age to have fought in that conflict, now advises the West
Deutsche Landesbank and the government of North Rhine-Westphalia in its work
with Nizhny: the region is steadily strengthening its links with the German
state. Giving a fulsome toast on Thursday night, Mr Boris Nemtsov, the young
governor of the region famous for his - increasingly unusual - pro-market
views, said that 'we have signed protocols on 25 different deals with North
Rhine-Westphalia, and 25 of them are being fulfilled.'
Mr Rhunau lighted on Nizhny because (he counts off the reasons): 'One,
excellent production equipment; two, highly educated workers; three, a high
social sense - people here are disciplined; and four, the leadership here
are the Russians of tomorrow.'
Mr Nemtsov and his colleagues may be Russians of tomorrow: but distinguished
Russians of the past head the local economy which is heavily biased towards
defence production. Indeed, as Mr Rhunau and his team negotiated with Mr
Nemtsov, an esplanade-full of tanks, guns, military vehicles and Migs were
presented for show in Nizhny's second defence fair - as local cash-strapped
industries tempt domestic and foreign buyers to arm themselves better.
The man whose plants make these and other products (such as the Volga car)
are at best sceptical of the market. A German-Russian seminar on military
conversion last week was a rehearsal of positions - the Germans stressing
the need for market knowledge and company-level initiative, the Russians
talking of their ability to switch production rapidly to produce goods for
an empty, undiscriminating market.
'Why has there not been a catastrophe here when the state slashed military
spending last year?' asks Mr Vladimir Luzyanin, general director of the
Hydromash engineering plant. 'Because in the 1970s we had already been
directed to devote part of our production to consumer goods. So for most of
us, it was a matter of increasing that proportion. We did it in 18 months.'
Mr Luzyanin and his colleagues do not want joint ventures with foreign
companies. He wants to trade. 'We have orders to make parts for the Airbus,'
he says. 'And for other western companies. We do all this. Now. With some
more money we will do better, by ourselves.'
Mr Yuri Sedakov, head of the NIIS plant which makes printed circuit boards
and production equipment, has, he says, got exemption from privatisation and
taken his enterprise under control of the Ministry of Atomic Energy because
'we have a unique range of equipment here, a unique technology - we cannot
allow it into the hands of those who might neglect it.'
Perhaps they are wrong to be so dismissive. At the military hardware
exhibition, Mr Karl-Heinz Kleidzinski, a social democrat member of the
Bundestag, a former (peacetime) fighter pilot and defence expert, kicks the
tyres on a howitzer and notes that its range is 24kms. 'It is not
competitive. The howitzers in the west have a range of 30kms: it could be
destroyed while getting into range.
The Mig 29 is made in Nizhny: one stands on the esplanade, guards handing
children into the cockpit as Russians and foreigners view what three years
ago was shrouded behind hangars in a city which itself had been closed until
the end of the eighties.
Yet these 'red directors' are the flower of the Soviet crop -commanding,
highly educated, devoted to their enterprises. They like neither the chaos
of the 'market' nor privatisation but insist they can run their enterprises
for the benefit of the country they have served. After six years of
Gorbachev, two of Yeltsin, industrial leaders in Russia's most
market-oriented region remain what they have always been.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATIONS into Italy's political corruption scandal could take a new
turn this week following testimony claiming Mr Raul Gardini, the
entrepreneur who killed himself in July, was the victim of a plot between
politicians and corrupt judges, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial intermediary who acted as go-between for Mr
Gardini's Montedison group at the time of the Enimont chemicals joint
venture with the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, has allegedly
accused Eni's then-management of colluding with Mr Diego Curto, a senior
Milan judge.
Mr Curto, arrested earlier this month, was responsible for the controversial
November 1990 ruling to freeze Eni's and Montedison's shares in Enimont at a
crucial stage in the battle for control of the public-private joint venture.
The new allegations were made in a leaked 14-page document by Mr Cusani, in
jail in Milan, to magistrates investigating Mr Curto on corruption charges.
According to the leaks, Mr Cusani claims the decision to freeze the Enimont
shares was made in collaboration with Eni and senior politicians to force Mr
Gardini to sell out.
A number of former Montedison executives now under investigation have
claimed the share freeze was a deliberate signal to Mr Gardini from Italy's
main political parties that his ambitions would be thwarted and that the
only way to unblock the situation was to arrange a deal with Eni. Until
then, Mr Gardini had waged a campaign to win control of the joint venture.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Mercedes puts France on list for new plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE was identified by Mercedes-Benz at the weekend as the fourth
short-listed production site for the German manufacturer's 200,000
units-a-year small car project. The others are the UK, the Czech Republic
and Germany itself.
The disclosure is certain to intensify rivalry among the short-listed
countries to attract one of the most prestigious greenfield projects in the
motor industry's recent history.
In the UK 'there will be as many bids as there are local authorities that
know about it', said a government official. He also suggested the project
'will need development funding, so will have to go to a selective assistance
area'.
Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials in London would not
comment on what stage the assessment process had reached and what role the
DTI might be playing.
However, the Northern Development Corporation, whose area includes the
Nissan plant at Sunderland, said it had already responded to a DTI request
made last week for details of potentially suitable 250-300-acre sites in its
area. The west Midlands, Merseyside and north and south Wales are expected
to be among the front-runners in the UK for the project.
Welsh development agency officials were at the weekend shedding no light on
their involvement.
However, they are likely to be encouraged in their own bid for the venture
by the recent rapid growth of the motor components industry in Wales and the
success of German motor components giant Robert Bosch in establishing a
Pounds 100m (Dollars 154m) components manufacturing centre in South Wales,
and that of Toyota, whose Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside in north Wales
has just begun component exports to Japan as well as supplying engines to
Toyota's car plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire.
That the Mercedes assessment process is still at a very early stage was
indicated by apparent surprise in both Paris and Prague that the project
might be up for grabs. 'German companies have a strategic interest in the
Czech Republic generally, but I have not heard of any discussions on this
specific project,' a senior Czech official said.
It would not be the first time Mercedes has examined the Czech Republic as a
possible production site. It discussed a possible Dollars 250m joint venture
with two Czech truck makers earlier this year, but the talks broke down in
March.
Spain is likely to be concerned it is not to be included in the short-list.
Its low labour costs have attracted significant German and Japanese motor
industry investment in recent years. However, it has been jolted by warnings
from Nissan that its operations need to make sharp productivity and quality
improvements.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
At 11am today in Washington, a brief document, to be signed by two old
enemies on the south lawn of the White House is intended to mark the end to
one of the 20th century's most bitter territorial conflicts.
After 18 months of secret negotiations in isolated farmhouses in Norway, an
audience of 2,500 distinguished guests will be on hand to witness Mr Shimon
Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Abu Mazen, a senior Palestine
Liberation Organisation official, put their names to the outline
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
The signing will be witnessed by Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO, who
flew into Washington last night for the first time since 1974, and his old
foe Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, who was due to arrive
early this morning.
It will cap an extraordinary two weeks which began when Israel and the PLO
took the world by surprise by announcing they were on the the verge of an
agreement on mutual recognition and limited Palestinian autonomy.
In the following days momentum behind the agreement grew. Mr Rabin faced
down opposition from the Israeli right wing, while last week Mr Arafat won
the support of the PLO's executive council. On Friday the two leaders
exchanged letters to seal the recognition agreement paving the way for
today's peace deal.
The US is keen to sustain the momentum for a wider Middle East peace.
President Bill Clinton said the US would continued with aid and military
assistance to Israel, while Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said
US troops might guarantee security in the Golan Heights after any Israeli
undertaking to withdraw from the Syrian land it conquered in 1967.
But Mr Clinton and Mr Al Gore, his vice president, both stressed that the US
did not see itself as the sole or main provider of financial aid to support
peace in the region.
In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Clinton said he had secured an
undertaking from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, for a large Saudi-led
financial package from the Gulf states - whose relations with the PLO were
deeply soured by Mr Arafat's support for Iraqi during the Gulf War.
Mr Clinton quoted the king as saying: 'You take the lead in organising it
and tell us what we're supposed to do . . . and I will wait to hear from
you.'
Mr Clinton said he had also elicited Syrian backing for the PLO-Israeli deal
during a 30-minute conversation with President Hafez al-Assad. He quoted Mr
Assad as saying: 'It is a positive thing, this agreement, for all of us.'
Mr Clinton said Mr Assad sought only the continued assistance of the US in
mediating future negotiations with Israel over a withdrawl from the Golan
Heights.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Educational dawn in California: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
California has a habit of anticipating the future. In 1978, the success of
Proposition 13, an initiative demanding lower property taxes, set off a
global movement towards lower tax rates. In a state-wide ballot on November
2, Californian voters will be asked to pass judgment on Proposition 174, an
educational initiative of comparable importance.
Market-oriented reformers have long queried the public sector's near
monopoly of education. The issue is not the need for public subsidies for
elementary and secondary education (that is axiomatic) but whether
governments should own schools and employ teachers. In theory, the education
budget could be turned over to families in the form of 'school vouchers.'
Parents would spend the vouchers at privately-run schools of their choice.
The educational world would then reap all the natural benefits of
competition - startling technical innovations, remarkable cost efficiency
and a variety of teaching methods.
Proposition 174, the Parental Choice in Education Initiative, would turn
this theory into practice. It says all parents should be given tax-exempt
vouchers, redeemable at private schools for about Dollars 2,600 (Pounds
1,730) (roughly half California's per pupil annual expenditure on education)
or at existing public-sector schools, for the full Dollars 5,200.
Several states have experimented with the kind of reforms introduced in
Britain, which offer limited parental choice within the public sector. But,
barring a small experiment in Milwaukee, none has contemplated giving
parents vouchers redeemable in private schools. That California is even
considering breaking this taboo is a reflection of the intense strains posed
by the explosive growth of its school-age population. On some estimates, the
state will need to open a new 600-pupil school every day for the next 10
years.
Californians, of course, also share national concerns about the low quality
of public-sector schools, despite a 29 per cent increase in
inflation-adjusted spending per pupil since 1983 and a decade of non-stop
education 'reform'. Last week, the US Education Department released a report
indicating that nearly half of all adults lack elementary skills in reading,
writing and arithmetic.
The likely effects of Proposition 174 are hotly debated. Opponents, led by
the financially powerful teachers' unions, say it would bankrupt the
public-school system. Taxpayers would have to fork out Dollars 2,600 for
every student that left for the private sector; at the margin, however,
savings would fall far short of this because of the high level of overheads
(for example the cost of buildings and redundancy pay for obsolete
teachers). Meanwhile, parents of students already educated privately would
receive an unnecessary subsidy that would only inflate fees in the private
sector. The gap between haves and have nots would widen.
Supporters dismiss such fears. Provided the number of students leaving the
public sector substantially exceeds the 10 per cent or so already educated
privately, the initiative ought to save money. This is because the proposed
subsidy for each privately educated pupil is only half the current cost of
education in the public sector. Since budgetary woes preclude a rapid
expansion of public-sector education, financial incentives to promote new
private schools are exactly the right response to current demographic
pressures. The injection of real competition into a system that has failed,
say enthusiasts, cannot help but improve educational standards.
Will Proposition 174 succeed? Close observers of the Californian political
scene, such as Mr Bruce Cain of the Institute for Government Studies at
Berkeley, are doubtful. He says Proposition 13 succeeded because people
expected it to bring immediate benefits - lower taxes. The impact of
Proposition 174 is far harder to gauge: nobody knows how many students might
shift out of the public sector or what this might do to public finances; the
only clear beneficiaries are parents already paying for private schools.
Given the complexities, he says, voters are likely to take their lead from
the public figures who line up for and against the proposition. The danger
is that it will become too closely identified with right-wingers and
religious fundamentalists - liabilities in a state that returned two liberal
Democratic senators in last year's election.
Even if Proposition 174 fails, it will force many people to think seriously
about the merits of vouchers. In the affluent late 20th century why should
the average family expect taxpayers to bear all the cost of education?
It is no use complaining that education is 'different' because much is
already provided commercially, for example through book publication and
television documentaries. Nor can privatised education be rejected as
unfair: every school system is already unjust because the best schools are
invariably located in the richest areas. The issue is not fairness but
whether the normal action of market forces should be permitted to improve
the average quality of schools, thus benefiting even the poorest children.
With luck Proposition 174 might even embarrass Messrs Clinton and Gore. In
spite of the hype about 'reinventing government' they are reluctant in the
face of union opposition even to promote increased parental choice in the
public sector.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Designs on the detractors - Francis Duffy,
president of the Royal Institute of British Architects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Architects have never had it so bad. The recession has put a third of them
out of work. Clients have become more demanding in terms of both service and
price. The construction industry has hijacked some of their traditional
functions. The public, from Prince Charles down, has found good sport in
ridiculing their work.
The government has now joined the battle: not only is it threatening to cut
funding for architecture courses, it is considering tampering with the
profession's very name. In February it published a proposal that would allow
anyone to call himself or herself an architect, no matter how poorly trained
or inexperienced.
The profession is in dire need of a champion. Francis Duffy, chairman of
architectural firm DEGW, has taken on that role following his appointment as
president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Duffy will get a
chance to fight for his fellow architects on Friday, when he attends a
meeting in Brussels of the Architects Council of Europe to discuss the
future of the profession over the next 20 years.
Initially, he might seem an unlikely champion for the profession. He has
seldom built anything, and has made his name as a theorist in the obscure
area of space management in office buildings. Yet his very distance may be
an asset: Duffy is going to be judged on his ability to convince the outside
world that, as he puts it, 'design matters and professionalism matters'.
The task is daunting. On one side is 'this wretched government and this
deal-saturated, unthinking, cheapo culture'. On the other are 'these poor,
kicked-around, disappointed architects'. He must find a way of convincing
the first of the worth of the second.
Speaking in his stylishly functional King's Cross office a few days before
his appointment, Duffy leaves no doubt as to his commitment to the cause. 'I
don't want to sound as if I'm whingeing, as I am extremely aggressive and
outgoing. But I am steamed up about the ways in which we are being kicked
around,' he says. His delivery is soft, rapid and uniform in tone.
Being steamed up is not enough. He must demonstrate that the title of
architect deserves legal protection.
'Would you applaud deregistration in medicine?' he asks. Yet architects are
not like doctors, who need medical qualifications in order to practise. By
contrast, there is no law to prevent anyone from designing buildings, yet
under legislation from the 1930s only those with Riba-approved training can
use the name architect.
Duffy experiments with another analogy: 'Take a bottle of champagne. It gets
that name not from a chemical analysis of its contents, but the process by
which it is made.' Likewise, he argues, the name 'architect' is 'an
important consumer marker. It has a built-in assumption of competence that
relates to the training and experience.'
But is he right to put so much into this fight over a name? Duffy starts to
get cross. 'God knows I'm not doing this for fun,' he says.
Surely architects could follow accountants, and call themselves chartered
architects if they had the qualifications approved of by the Riba? Duffy
pulls a face.
'I think of Blake: I wander thro' each charter'd street/Near where the
charter'd Thames does flow/And mark in every face I meet/Marks of weakness,
marks of woe. A thing is a thing. I don't want a qualifier. It's my name.'
Displaying an almost touching optimism, Duffy seems confident that
architects will win this battle. 'There is a resonance. It's quite
widespread.'
In any case, he says, the argument is not just about a name. It is a symbol
of the need for a debate about the future of design. Partly thanks to Prince
Charles, a public debate is under way, yet according to Duffy its substance
is banal. 'I like this, you like that, you're a fool - it does not strike me
as an elevated discussion.'
Getting an intelligent debate going may not be easy. Public enemy number one
is the government. A close second is what Duffy calls 'the supply side',
which means the construction and property companies. He argues that the
prevailing supply-side mentality is to get things built as quickly as
possible to ensure instant gratification for shareholders. 'Many on the
supply side say that design is a luxury, that you need one Richard Rogers a
century. That devalues design.'
On his list of villains, architects themselves do not escape without a
mention. He argues that most have got too far from their clients, and many
are inclined to dwell on past glories rather than defining a new mission. He
admits that the profession is 'an economic failure'. He diagnoses a 'lack of
commercial nous'.
But how have architects persisted in these uncommercial ways when other
professions have been forced to come to terms with market-mad Britain? Duffy
replies: 'We have not recovered from the trauma of having been so important
in the 1950s and 1960s as handmaidens of the welfare state. Until the 1970s
architects working for commerce were despised. We haven't found a comparable
commercial apparatus to get us into the 1980s and 1990s.'
Last year Duffy chaired a Riba committee which set out to find a new
strategic direction for the profession. Its conclusions were not dissimilar
to those reached by many underperforming British companies over the past
decade: architects must get closer to their clients, and understand better
what they want. They must strengthen their hold over their central function
 -design - and should also branch out into other design and management-based
services.
'If we know what our mission is, we should feel no threat,' he says.
Architecture is 'knowledge about invention, design and understanding
patterns of use'.
Above all, it is about defining the future. On this subject, Duffy gets
carried away. 'We ought to be thinking about what Britain is doing in 700
years,' he says.
In office design, the area which he has made his own, Duffy is looking
further ahead than most, even if he is not quite building offices for the
year 2693.
He believes that the nature of work, and the shape of organisations are
undergoing their most important change in 100 years. Office buildings, which
he says have not changed much since Frank Lloyd Wright designed the office
towers in Chicago at the beginning of the century, must be rethought too.
Under the old corporate hierarchies, the space allocated to each worker was
a reflection of how important they were. The new flat organisational
structures, with their team-working and flexi-time, call for a complete
redesign of office space. Duffy argues that, unless buildings change,
companies may find their plans to change their organisations frustrated.
Enthused, he talks of offices at IBM, Digital and Arthur Andersen, where the
basic unit of design is not the individual but the group, in which no one
has his or her own space. It might be cheaper but is it really better? Don't
people need to have their own desks?
He looks exasperated. 'These are conventions,' he says. 'It's like the club,
library or dining room. The space is yours, it belongs to you collectively.'
Duffy then gestures around his own office. 'We have no enclosed offices. We
have a street. The coffee place is designed so that people will bump into
each other.'
On inspection, the 'street' turns out to be an aisle separating two lines of
architects' desks. Challenged, he agrees that the metaphor is a little far
fetched. 'We are having to invent,' he says. 'For once the physical concept
is ahead of the words.'
Street or not, he may find his own offices more congenial than the splendid
Riba building in London's Portland Place. Ironically, it is just the sort of
building in which he argues change is impossible - a large open space in the
middle and a whole number of little offices scattered round the sides.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Europe's flights of fantasy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 18 months since signature, the Maastricht Treaty has had such a
sand-bagging from events in the real world, that it is hard to see how it
can be made to work without a far-reaching re-think. Unfortunately, no-one
is offering that.
The unresolved crisis in the exchange rate mechanism is, of course, the most
immediate item on the European Community's emergency agenda, because it
appears to threaten the objective of economic and monetary union,
centre-piece of Maastricht. The crisis does not prove the arguments of those
who say that the Emu objective is in any case ill-advised, unnecessary and
unattainable. But it shows that the system was politically under-engineered,
because the member states were unprepared to navigate through a heavy
speculative upheaval. Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems unsure whether
Maastricht's timetable should now be lengthened, or indeed shortened; but
neither alternative is allowed for in the treaty.
But the ERM crisis is a political, not a technical problem. Experts may
disagree over how, or indeed whether, to revise the details of the EMU
programme. But the basic problem is that there is no political consensus on
the objective of monetary union. When Maastricht was negotiated, the UK
wanted the right to opt out; after two currency crises, British ambivalence
seems to have been replaced by hostility. It is difficult to believe in the
possibility of a renegotiated Emu programme, without political agreement on
the final objective.
Political dissent over the objective of Emu is symptomatic of widespread
ambivalence over the objectives of Maastricht. It showed up vividly in the
Danish and French ratification debates, as well as in opinion polls in other
countries, but nowhere as deeply or as intensely as in Britain.
This ambivalence is starkest over Europe's foreign policy. One way or
another, the member states will be compelled to resolve the EMU crisis,
because non-solution will become intolerable: economic actors will not long
accept instability and incompetence. But there can be no mechanical solution
to the foreign policy quandary; every decision is a deliberate act of will,
a reflection of fundamental political preferences. In Bosnia, France and
Britain have worked closely together; but Maastricht maximises the
procedural obstacles to multilateral co-operation, and in practice the
policy of the Community towards ex-Yugoslavia has been catastrophic in its
weakness and vacillation.
In a sensible world, member states would now conduct a thorough review of
the treaty, as drafted, to see if it can be made to work better. So far,
there seems to be a serious mis-match between what Maastricht appears to
promise, and what the member states are really committed to deliver. Is this
mainly the result of British hostility to the whole enterprise? Or is it
also the result of ambivalence in other member states? These questions need
to be confronted.
But it seems the member states find these questions too disagreeable and
prefer flight into make-believe. In Lisbon, and again in Edinburgh, they
agreed to early membership negotiations with the four applicants from Efta;
in Copenhagen this June they brought forward prospects of membership for
east European countries, and others.
According to one interpretation* the Community is now committed to an
enlargement to 20 or 30 members within the next decade or so. Now there may
be a politico-moral case, for the Community eventually to take in liberated
eastern Europe. But does it make practical sense, on the basis of a treaty
of European union which is not workable as written, and which does not
appear to reflect a genuine political bargain by the member states? It is
hard to imagine a recipe for greater political lunacy.
The Community cannot expand from 12 to 25 states without completely changing
in character. There are four possibilities: accelerated federalism, with a
vast increase in central powers; a multi-speed Europe, with overlapping
membership circles; a comprehensive renegotiation of all existing Community
policies; or the disintegration of all common policy-making powers. None of
these options is discussed; instead, it is assumed that the Community will
be the same but much bigger; which is nonsense.
First, the Common Agricultural Policy could not be applied in eastern
Europe, as it would mean a dizzying explosion both in the Community budget
and in farm output.
Second, GNP per head in eastern Europe is one-tenth of that in western
Europe. A Community with such disparities must mean a Europe which was
brutally laissez-faire or one which was both federal and heavily
centralised.
Existing Community policy should mean a vast expansion in the regional and
other structural funds. But the conventional wisdom is that the Europe of
nation states could not tolerate even a moderate amount of central budgeting
and central authority. The conventional wisdom needs to find an answer to
the fact that, even if the east grew by as much as 5 percentage points a
year faster than the west, it would still take 48 years to catch up.
There are no simple solutions to any of these problems. The only solutions
we know will not work, are those which pretend that Maastricht is fine as it
stands. If the Community expands to 25 states, it will need considerable
political surgery, and perhaps a political civil war. But governments prefer
fantasy.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOCUS in currency markets will be on the Japanese yen this week, amid
expectations that the authorities in Tokyo are on the verge of unveiling a
package of measures to stimulate the economy, writes James Blitz.
On Friday, the yen came under strong selling pressure against the dollar as
dealers took the view that the authorities in Tokyo were about to implement
their third successive fiscal boost to the economy, possibly cutting the
official discount rate in the process.
Last week, Mr Manae Kubota, the Economic Planning Agency Minister, said that
the prime minister wanted a one trillion yen package to improve the social
infrastructure.
Another factor pushing the yen lower may have been reports that the Japanese
foreign minister had said that Tokyo could set targets for the reduction of
the trade surplus.
Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan bank in London, says the yen
is likely to come under strong pressure this week - and he expects it to
fall as low as Y110 in the next few weeks.
European dealers are likely to be preoccupied with developments in France
and Germany.
Following last week's Bundesbank rate cut, there are expectations that the
French could take the opportunity to ease policy in their money market
operations. However, many dealers expect the strength of the D-Mark to
persist, and this may stay the Bank of France's hand for a while longer.
In the US, the markets will focus on August consumer prices, retail sales
and industrial production. The CPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent, after
Friday's 0.6 percent fall in producer prices. Retail sales are expected to
rise 0.1 percent with industrial production up a modest 0.3 percent.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Bonds: IFC emerges from the World Bank's
shadows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World
Bank, is starting to emerge from the shadow of its bigger and older sibling.
In the past, the IFC's presence in the international bond market has been
dwarfed by the World Bank, whose borrowing programme is about 10 times
bigger than the IFC's. However,rapidly growing demand from developing
countries for private-sector financing could well tip the balance more in
the IFC's favour in the coming years.
Mr Robert Graffam, director of the IFC's treasury and financial policy
department, says volume of new financing has risen 20 per cent a year over
the past five years.
Although the lion's share of the IFC's investment programme is financed
through loans, it also makes equity and off-balance-sheet investments.
For example, the new investment programme for the current fiscal year, which
runs until the end of June 1994, is estimated at Dollars 2.4bn. Of the
total, Mr Graffam expects that Dollars 1.6bn will be in the form of loans,
which the IFC will finance by borrowing in the international bond market.
This compares with a borrowing programme of about Dollars 1bn in the 1993
fiscal year, and an annual average of Dollars 800m in the preceding three
years.
The IFC tends to conduct most of its borrowing in fixed-rate dollars, which
are then swapped into floating-rate dollars. This is because 90 per cent of
its lending is denominated in the US currency. However, it taps other
sectors of the international bond market if they offer attractive swap
opportunities back into dollars.
It has already raised about Dollars 650m this fiscal year through various
issues denominated in Hong Kong dollars, lire and yen.
The IFC plans to launch a dollar Eurobond issue of between Dollars 300m and
Dollars 500m in the next three months. Mr Graffam is aiming for a spread of
not more than five basis points over the yield on the World Bank's latest
global bond offering. The World Bank's offering was priced to yield 10 basis
points over underlying US Treasuries at the launch last week.
The IFC's average funding target for its Eurobond issues, which usually have
a maturity of five years, is 50 basis points below dollar Libor (London
interbank offered rate). But the IFC, which is triple-A rated, only achieved
36 basis points below dollar Libor in fiscal 1993, mainly because of a lack
of arbitrage opportunities. Currency and interest-rate swaps were hindered
by volatile financial markets earlier in the year, when the European
exchange rate mechanism came under pressure.
The IFC is an intensive user of derivatives. This facility has been extended
to its clients to enable them to manage risk more smoothly and to trade on
the same terms as competitors in the developed world.
Most developing countries are barred from the international derivatives
markets because they are not regarded as acceptable counterparts in a swap
transaction. The other obstacle is a lack of information about how to
operate in these highly complex markets.
Since the IFC is eligible to trade in the international derivatives markets
 -the notional value of its swap book stood at Dollars 4.9bn at the end of
fiscal 1993, against total borrowings of Dollars 5.5bn - it can act as an
intermediary for its clients.
Mr Graffam gives the example of an Egyptian steel company which would have
been driven out of business but for the IFC's access to the derivatives
market.
The company was having increasing difficulty in servicing a large
yen-denominated loan, taken out to finance the purchase of capital equipment
from Japan, because the yen had started to rise sharply and its revenue was
denominated in dollars. However, the IFC saved the company from bankruptcy
by executing a series of currency swaps on its behalf.
'By using derivatives our clients can eradicate mismatches which should not
have been there in the first place,' Mr Graffam says.
The IFC is active throughout the world, but at present more than 60 per cent
of its loan and equity portfolio is located in Latin America and Asia.
However, Mr Graffam expects the weighting to shift to eastern Europe and the
Middle East over the coming years, as those regions adopt market-oriented
economic policies. The IFC recently made its first investment in Lebanon for
10 years.
The IFC, whose share capital is provided by its 155 member countries, seeks
profitable returns on its loans and equity investments. 'We would like to be
increasingly self-sustaining,' says Mr Graffam. 'We cannot rely on getting
additional financing from our shareholders.'
Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has upgraded the
foreign-currency debt rating of the People's Republic of China by one notch
to A3 from Baa1. The rating has been assigned to China's Y30bn five-year
Eurobond issue launched last week.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Divisions hazy in OTC derivatives clearing
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE clearing of over-the-counter derivative products, debated at last week's
annual gathering of exchange executives at Burgenstock in Switzerland, is
attracting mounting attention, but the industry remains divided by vested
interests.
OTC instruments are currently settled bilaterally (between two
counterparties), while exchange-traded contracts are settled through a
clearing house, which assumes the credit exposure. The issue has highlighted
the blurring of definitions of exchange-traded and OTC products.
Historically, the distinction has been that exchange-traded instruments are
highly homogeneous and standardised products, while OTC instruments are
individually designed to suit each clients' needs, and therefore unsuitable
for central clearing.
The reality is that standardisation is relative. For example, parts of the
dollar swap market are liquid and actively traded using the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association's master agreements.
Several exchanges have looked at the possibility of using their own clearing
houses to settle OTC products, a potentially lucrative business. OM
Stockholm already offers a service known as tailor-made clearing for certain
instruments.
The most advanced project is to use the Options Clearing Corporation to
operate clearing for OTC market participants through Multinet, which is
being set up as a New York bank by founding members, which include First
National and Chase.
There have also been efforts by exchanges to design products which emulate
the specially-tailored characteristics of OTC swaps and options.
The most successful venture to date has been the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's flex options. Other exchanges, including the American Stock
Exchange - which launched its first flex options on stock indices on Friday
 -and the Chicago Board of Trade - which plans to launch flex options on
treasury futures - are hoping to emulate that success.
However a global service offering clearing to the broader OTC market could
come from a different source. The Exchange Clearing House - Echo  - will
next year offer multilateral foreign exchange contract netting and
settlement on a global basis. Its dozen shareholders are all banks,
including Barclays, Commerzbank, Rabobank and Banque Nationale de Paris.
Mr Graham Duncan, managing director of Echo, says the scope may be extended
to include longer-dated, derivative instruments. However, the issue is a
complex one. In the foreign exchange market, the main worry is settlement
risk: overnight exposure to a credit often for very large amounts of money.
In the derivatives market there is not only the initial settlement risk, but
credit risk continues throughout the life of the swap. If a clearing house
were involved, the clearing house, not another bank or company, would become
the counterparty.
This solution may not be favourably viewed by the top-rated banks, which
currently not only have a competitive advantage, but are able to charge a
premium of 5 or 10 basis points to their clients, because of their strong
credit ratings. Since most of them are not keen to sacrifice this advantage,
the chances of a pan-industry drive for derivative instruments appears slim.
There is another more serious argument, which suggests that an OTC clearing
house could actually increase, rather than reduce, risk. It goes like this:
bank deposit guarantee schemes have proved dangerous because investors take
the view that, as long as their money is guaranteed, they should go for the
best return regardless of credit.
Similarly, in a clearing house agreement, low-rated banks could be given
excessively large credit lines by other banks because they know they do not
have to worry about credit.
However, there are pressures in the other direction too: regulatory and
capital pressures may yet drive banks towards multilateral clearing in the
OTC market.

TAKE another cigarette from the packet. Light up, sit back and draw deeply.
If you dwell for too long on the heights to which the US bond market has
climbed, you'll need something to steady your nerves; and after all, smoking
is now cheaper than it's been for years.
Cigarette prices have become one of the most powerful symbols of this
deflationary era. Last month, the price of cigarettes tumbled by no less
than 25.6 per cent. The price war sparked by Philip Morris earlier this
year, when it announced a cut in the price of its Marlboro brand for a trial
period (later made permanent), finally hit home.
The downswing in cigarette prices accounted for the 0.6 per cent fall in the
producer price index for finished goods in August, the biggest drop for more
than two years. Without tobacco, the figures released on Friday showed a 0.2
per cent rise for the month.
After the three previous months of declines (reversing the up-tick in spring
which seemed to herald a rise in inflation), the latest figures brought the
annual rise in the producer price index down to a paltry 0.6 per cent.
The figures sparked yet another round of buying in the bond market's latest
two-month surge. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond staged a one-point
rally, driving the yield down to 5.87 per cent. At that level, the yield was
seven basis points lower than a week before, and around 70 basis points
lower than at the beginning of August.
It all feels like a year ago, when weak August employment and prices figures
raised questions about the strength of the US recovery.
The bond market bulls had something else to celebrate last week: a sharp
setback in the gold price. The rally which had taken the price of gold from
less than Dollars 340 an ounce to nearly Dollars 400 appeared in the early
summer to herald a belief that resurgent inflation was about to make a
come-back.
On Thursday, though, no less than Dollars 14 an ounce was wiped off the
price of gold, leaving it at around Dollars 350 an ounce and putting the
market back close to its lowest for seven years. Weak oil prices - which
contributed to the August slump in the producer price index - have also
raised the spirits of bond buyers.
Nevertheless, the Treasury market is becoming a dangerous place to be for
those of a nervous disposition. Just a day before Friday's producer price
numbers, the price of the long bond dropped a point and a half, driven down
by news that the powerful House Ways and Means Committee was to review the
exemption from withholding tax of foreign investors (the withholding tax was
lifted in 1984).
Given the scale of the US budget deficit, and the role played by foreigners
in financing it, no-one seriously expects a withholding tax to be reimposed
(a more likely reason for foreigners to stay out of the Treasury market is
the weakening dollar.) However, the market was looking for the chance of a
correction, and the withholding tax scare seemed as good an opportunity as
any.
Were the last two days' trading a warning of greater volatility to come?
Speaking during the relative calm of Wednesday, Mr Leif Olsen, a former
chief economist of Citicorp, who now runs his own consultancy, Ecom
Consultants, cautioned that the bond market was about to enter a more
volatile period.
After several months of low inflation, one or two months of
higher-than-average price rises will be needed to keep inflation for the
year at the 2.5 to 3 per cent level that most economists expect (the recent
figures have not prompted economists to review their inflation forecasts
downwards, whatever the market markets' outlook).
When the monthly data show a bigger rise in prices, how will the bond market
react? Investors will be hard-pushed to tell whether it is just one month of
higher prices, or whether the long-run trend has turned up, says Mr Olfsen.
Mr David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services of Chicago, has
a similar point to make. Writing ahead of last week's figures, he pointed to
the likely inflationary effects of the mid-west flood on food prices, and
the imposition of a gasoline tax.
'The odds are high that there will be at least one or two months of 5 per
cent inflation at annual rates during the fourth quarter. If industrial raw
materials are also firming, there will probably be a setback in bond prices
and the Fed will have another serious discussion about whether it should
hike short-term interest rates,' he said.
Time for another cigarette?

FT  13 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Signs point to extended advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER another fall in long-dated gilt yields and soothing words from the UK
chancellor about public borrowing, bond investors see little on the horizon
to interrupt the upward movement in prices of the past few months.
The drop of about 10 basis points in yields of 20-year gilts during the week
brings the fall in the past month to roughly 70 basis points. In the year
since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism, yields for this
class of gilts have dropped by more than 2 percentage points, underlining
expectations that inflationary pressures will remain muted for some time.
Investors were cheered last week by comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that he was prepared for tough action in his Budget on November
30 to curb the growing gap between state spending and borrowing.
Although such remarks have become obligatory for any chancellor, Mr Clarke
has expressed himself with enough force to persuade many gilt practitioners
that he means what he says.
With a raft of government data this week - notably Wednesday's retail price
index for August - about the UK economy, and an expected announcement by the
Bank of England that a gilt auction of about Pounds 3bn will be held at the
end of the month, trading over the next few days can be expected to pick up.
In the short term, funding will provide few worries for the market, given
that as the Bank has already sold about Pounds 30bn of the Pounds 45bn or so
of gilts which it will probably have to despatch during this financial year.
So the Bank probably sees no need to accelerate its programme of gilt sales,
mainly through monthly auctions.
However, expectations that the Bank will sell internationally important
10-year stock at this month's auction slowed foreign demand for this type of
gilt during the past week, one factor for yields being little changed in
this section of the gilt curve.
Later in the 1990s, the volume of gilts needed to fund the high projected
borrowing requirements may force up yields. That explains the interest in
the various strategies for pulling back the state deficit, which according
to the Treasury's last forecasts in March will drop only marginally to
Pounds 44bn in 1994-95 from Pounds 50bn this financial year. Many
private-sector economists, including some of the Treasury's outside
advisers, believe significant cuts in public spending may be needed,
alongside the Pounds 16bn of tax increases already scheduled for the next
two years.
The consensus among economists is that it would be difficult to make
substantial inroads into the planned spending of Pounds 254bn in the next
financial year. However later in the 1990s parts of the Pounds 70bn-a-year
social security budget could be cut, especially in areas such as child
benefit.
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, one of the 'seven wise
men' who advise the Treasury on economic issues, favours an urgent programme
of public spending cuts from 1995-96.
Both Prof Minford and Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the
Confederation of British Industry and another 'wise man', see no need for Mr
Clarke to announce more tax increases for next April. This is on the grounds
that the expected recovery will automatically push up tax revenues.
However, Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London
Business School and another Treasury adviser, believes the underlying
deficit is so big that a further increase in taxes of up to Pounds 4bn may
be needed from 1994-95.

FT  13 SEP 93 / German Bonds: D-Mark's strength provides support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDLEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last week's 'rate cut that wasn't', German government bonds are
expected to stay supported in the short term by the D-Mark's continuing
strength.
Moreover, slow economic growth and the government's restrictive fiscal
stance are expected to keep a lid on inflationary pressures, allowing the
Bundesbank to cut rates further - albeit slowly - and supporting bunds in
the longer term.
While the Bundesbank last week cut its discount and Lombard rates by a half
point, to 6 1/4 and 7 1/4 per cent respectively, it lowered its more
important repo rate by only 10 basis points, to 6.70 per cent, reaffirming
its cautious easing stance.
Bund yields rose on the news on profit-taking after the recent rally.
Ten-year yields have fallen some 110 basis points since the beginning of the
year. In the past month alone, they dropped by 25 basis points to 6.12 per
cent.
However, last week's modest repo easing has capped long yields and boosted
the D-Mark against the dollar and most European currencies. Most analysts
say this scenario is likely to continue supporting bunds in coming weeks.
According to Mr George Magnus, chief international economist with SG
Warburg, a reversal of the D-Mark's strength is unlikely. For one, European
central banks will continue buying D-Marks to shore up their foreign
reserves, which were depleted by heavy currency intervention during the
recent crisis in Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
Moreover, as Germany's neighbours start exploiting their wider ERM
fluctuation bands to cut rates independently, their currencies may weaken
further against the D-Mark, he says. Lastly, Mr Magnus points out that
German real short-term rates are unlikely to fall much as their decline will
go hand-in-hand with a decline in inflation.
The Bundesbank justified its latest rate cuts with ebbing inflation,
lower-than-expected money supply growth, and the D-Mark's strength.
In western Germany headline inflation is currently running at 4.2 per cent,
but economists expect the rate to fall to around 3.5 per cent by the year
end, and well below 3 per cent in 1994.
M3 money supply, which grew by an annualised 7.4 per cent in July, is set to
rise further in August, bloated by that month's heavy currency intervention.
However Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger said recently he expected
M3 to return to its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target later this year. The
Bundesbank regards M3 as an indicator of future inflation.
Meanwhile, Bonn's plans for a tighter fiscal stance indicate the total
public-sector deficit as a percentage of GDP will fall in coming years from
some 8 per cent in 1993. All this will support bunds in coming months, and
analysts see 10-year yields falling to around 6 per cent by the year end,
and as low as 5 1/4 per cent in 1994.
Continued rate cuts by the Bundesbank would enable investors to make quick
profits by placing their money at the short end of the yield curve. But
longer-term investors are still best off at the long end, most analysts
concur.
'When the Bundesbank starts easing again, the shorter maturities should
perform well,' said Mr Rainer Back, bond strategist at DB Research, a
Deutsche Bank subsidiary. 'But over the longer term, the long end offers the
best total returns.'

PACIFIC Dunlop, the Melbourne-based industrial conglomerate, yesterday
reported a 22.2 per cent advance in group profit after tax and abnormal
items, at ADollars 260.4m (USDollars 170.4m) for the year ended June.
Before abnormal items, the rise was slightly smaller - up 21 per cent, while
pre-tax operating profit rose 21.3 per cent to ADollars 384.7. Earnings per
share stood at 27.5 cents. Turnover was 8.6 per cent higher at ADollars
6.3bn.
Mr John Gough, chairman, said the improvement in operating profit had been
spread across the group. The company was 'ready for another period of strong
growth', he said.
Performance was particularly marked at GNB Battery Technologies, where
earnings before interest and tax advanced 67 per cent.
Elsewhere, solid results were returned by the distribution division, and by
South Pacific Tyres and Pacific Dunlop Cables. In foods, the group was 'on
schedule to achieving the desired levels of profitability and returns'.
Results from the footwear and textile business, and from the industrial,
foam and fibre group were described as 'satisfactory'.

Russia

<TEXT>
DRESDNER BANK and Banque Nationale de Paris have opened a joint subsidiary
in St Petersburg in the first inauguration of a bank wholly-owned by
foreigners in Russia since the Bolshevik revolution.
Set in the former German embassy in St Petersburg, BNP-Dresdner Bank
(Rossija) has a capital of Dollars 10m and a staff of 80.
However, a cloud was cast on the opening by the Russian parliament's
proposed ban on foreign banks dealing with Russian customers. It is due to
decide on Friday whether to finally enact this restriction, which would go
into force next January and last until 1996.
The law confining foreign banks to dealing with foreign clients has been
pushed through parliament by powerful Russian commercial banks fearing
foreign competition. It is opposed by President Boris Yeltsin, the
government, the central bank, and parliament's own sub-committee on banking.
They see foreign banks, five of which have already received full banking
licences, as a source of western banking expertise and foreign investment.
One central bank official said yesterday he feared last-minute lobbying by
the government and the central bank would fail to prevent parliament from
going ahead with the law. Another, however, was quoted as saying the central
bank would ignore any parliamentary ban.
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg mayor who wants to restore the city to
its pre-revolutionary role as Russia's banking centre, hailed 'the courage
and wisdom of the two banks in braving the risks to set up their bank'.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: OMV warns of restructuring as
losses continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, has reported
a first-half operating loss of Sch552m (Dollars 49m) after a loss of Sch584m
in the same period last time.
The group, which had forecast a return to profit this year, has been badly
hurt in recent months by low cost competition from eastern European refiners
and chemical makers. It said it expected an operating loss of about Sch1bn
in the full year, and was 'unlikely' to pay a dividend.
It warned that large-scale restructuring measures were planned. These would
involve the closure of chemical plants, the disposal of selected chemical
and polymer processing activities, and the formation of business alliances
in some chemical and plastics sectors.
The bad news followed a week of turmoil in OMV shares - among the most
liquid and widely held Austrian equities - in response to speculation about
the results and the cancellation of a press conference pending approval by
the supervisory board of restructuring plans. The shares tumbled from Sch797
on Monday to a low of Sch700 before recovering to Sch742 at the week's
close.
The group said its plastics division had 'an extremely difficult time' in
the first quarter, while earnings in the petrochemicals, refining and
chemicals businesses dropped sharply in the second quarter.
The extent of the deterioration was emphasised by the fact that the loss was
incurred in spite of cost savings of Sch1bn through earlier rationalisation
programmes. The group said it did not expect any improvement in market
conditions in the coming months. Turnover was flat at Sch40bn, and cash flow
rose 8.7 per cent to Sch2.34bn.
OMV said its exploration and production division improved operating profit
from Sch20m to Sch260m, but mainly because of spending cuts and the sale of
its Canadian subsidiary.
The important refining business widened its loss from Sch300m to Sch380m,
partly because of weak prices but also because of increased competition from
low-cost eastern European refineries.
The marketing division eked out a Sch30m profit after a loss of Sch80m,
mainly because of the benefits of rationalising the petrol station network.
Losses in the chemicals division doubled to Sch430m, as prices in western
European industrial markets slid. Eastern European competition hurt
fertiliser sales and prices.
Plastics prices recovered slightly in the second quarter, but remained below
previous year levels. The divisional loss expanded slightly to Sch710m from
Sch690m.

<TEXT>
LTV, the third-biggest US steel producer, is planning an international share
offering just weeks after emerging from seven years in bankruptcy
protection.
The company plans to sell 20m new shares, 3m of them internationally,
according to a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Its share price fell Dollars  1/2 on the news, to end last week at Dollars
11.
LTV said it planned to use the proceeds to support its capital spending and
make contributions to its pension plan, among other things. As part of the
court-approved agreement with creditors that allowed it to emerge from
bankruptcy in June, LTV agreed to pay Dollars 850m into its pension fund at
once to cover part of the plan's Dollars 3bn underfunding. It has to pay the
remainder over the next 28 years.
The issue will be the second injection of capital for the steelmaker: its
financial reorganisation also triggered a Dollars 200m investment from
Sumitomo Metal Industries of Japan, which now holds around 10 per cent of
the company.
The share issue will be underwritten by Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and
Smith Barney.

<TEXT>
PEREGRINE Investments, the Hong Kong-listed pan-Asian securities business,
has been disciplined by the colony's stock market regulators for misconduct
concerning three flotations handled by the company.
Peregrine, which last year purchased 24 per cent of UK fund management
group, Invesco MIM, has rapidly emerged as the largest independent merchant
banking group in Hong Kong. It has strong commercial and equity links to
some of the colony's leading businessmen, such as Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Gordon
Wu and Citic's Mr Larry Yung.
A public reprimand was yesterday delivered to Peregrine's broking arm over
activities in the shares of three companies floated by the group's merchant
bank.
The Securities and Futures Commission also expressed concern that the
listing rules had been breached in two of these flotations, where Peregrine
failed to ensure that 25 per cent of the companies' shares were placed in
public hands.
The SFC published three specific allegations against Peregrine Brokerage. It
was accused of: engaging in stock trading 'which was likely to be
prejudicial to the interests of the investing public'; contributing to a
restricted free-float in the shares of three newly-listed companies; and
failing to adequately monitor client trading activities.
Peregrine's dealing director, Mr Jimmy Pang, has had his licence suspended
for 2 1/2 years, and fellow director Mr Peter Wong has also been publicly
reprimanded. Mr Pang has left the group.
Peregrine agreed to pay HKDollars 3.5m (USDollars 452,000) to a stock
exchange compensation fund, 'in recognition of the SFC's concerns about the
three areas of misconduct'. It also said it had taken steps to avoid
repetition of 'these problems'.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Secret life of the rich and
well-connected - Profile of Hong Kong entrepreneur Mr Robert Kuok
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Kuok Hock Nien is not a typical media tycoon. A Malaysian Chinese
who has based himself in Hong Kong for more than a decade, Mr Kuok makes
only rare public appearances and avoids any media contact.
He is typical of a select group of the region's overseas Chinese
entrepreneurs. One business associate summed him up with: 'He is very
private, very well-connected, very pro-China, and very rich.'
Mr Kuok has no expertise in newspapers, and his only media exposure is as a
passive 33 per cent shareholder in TVB, Hong Kong's largest broadcasting
station.
Mr Kuok's business empire stretches across national boundaries, encompassing
a complex web of private and public companies, mostly controlled by
relatives or trusts.
He earned his initial fortune in the commodities business, and is still
known as Asia's 'Sugar King'. He established his first sugar manufacturing
enterprise in Malaysia in the late 1950s, moving into sugar cultivation soon
after. With steadily rising prices, Mr Kuok amassed millions from his sugar
dealing in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Later, Mr Kuok expanded outside the region, forming a joint venture with the
French Cie Commercial Sucres et Denrees, the world's biggest sugar trader.
He became involved in the oil trading business, bought control of a
Singapore shipping line and, through his listed Perlis Plantations company
in Malaysia, started cultivating rubber and palm oil as well as mining tin
and iron ore.
As the commodities side of his empire was hit by low world prices, Mr Kuok
concentrated on expanding into other sectors, notably his Shangri-La group
of hotels. He now owns or operates 23 luxury hotels or resorts around the
world.
The Kuok group has also moved into investments in housing schemes, in
shopping complexes, and in beach resorts. Through all his business dealings,
Mr Kuok showed himself to be adept at making the right connections and
contacts - guanxi in Chinese.
Over the years he has built up a formidable network of regional business
associates, including Mr Liem Sioe Liong, controller of the Salim group of
Indonesia, believed to be the world's biggest Chinese controlled group of
companies.
'The Kuok empire is one of a handful of overseas Chinese companies that have
influence in virtually every country in the region,' says a Malaysian
analyst.
'The amazing thing is it's still, fundamentally, a family-run business with
the patriarch himself making the big decisions. And because its dealings are
mostly informal and secretive, no one really knows just how much it's all
worth.'
Mr Kuok, who is 69, this year officially retired from the day-to-day running
of the empire. In the traditional Chinese manner, the Hong Kong and
Singapore/Malaysian operations were divided between two sons; but equally
traditionally, Mr Kuok has kept a close eye on their activities and remains
at the core of the decision making process.
One of the keys to his broad-based business network has been his ability to
cultivate political contacts. He has made substantial contributions to a
wide range of political causes, and is close to the leadership in Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines - and in China.
In 1976, Mr Kuok moved his headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong, and
became a permanent resident two years later. He owns two prime hotels, and
his flagship company, Kerry, has been active in trading and stockbroking.
However, from the start his attention has been firmly focused on China.
In 1984, he made his first significant investment in China, the Dollars 480m
World Trade Centre in Beijing. His Hong Kong-listed hotel arm, Shangri-La
Asia, owns stakes in six mainland hotels, and he has committed billions of
US dollars in investments ranging from an oil refinery and port development
in China's Guangxi Province, to numerous property projects. Through these
investments, he has also built up an immaculate portfolio of contacts in
Beijing.
His only Hong Kong-listed vehicle, Shangri-La Asia, has mainland minority
shareholders which include the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, and the Beijing office of China International Trade and Investment
Corporation (Citic).
Mr Kuok has been closely involved with the expansion of Citic's Hong
Kong-listed arm, Citic Pacific, in which Mr Kuok is now the second-largest
shareholder. He has a 13 per cent stake in the company, which has a stock
market capitalisation of HKDollars 30bn.
Recently, Mr Kuok's Kerry group secured a 15 per cent interest in the
HKDollars 7bn (USDollars 903.2m) Western Harbour tunnel, which will link
Hong Kong island with the new West Kowloon expressway leading up to the
airport. The consortium also includes Citic and China Merchants, another
leading Beijing company in Hong Kong.
It is these connections with Beijing, combined with his lack of media
experience, which will inevitably colour perceptions of his acquisition of
the South China Morning Post, his largest single Hong Kong investment.
In a written interview in 1991, Mr Kuok admitted he was 'averse to dealing
with the media'. He will undoubtedly remain a distant figure in the workings
of his newspaper, but few are prepared to believe that he will not provide
both editorial and business direction.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ulster TV rises to Pounds 1.97m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Ulster Television, the independent programme contractor, advanced
from Pounds 1.79m to Pounds 1.97m pre-tax for the six months ended June 30.
The improvement was scored on the back of a turnover some 2.5 per cent lower
at Pounds 13.2m.
Directors said that comparisons with last year were beset by complexities
arising from the loss of Channel 4 airtime, the introduction of a new basis
of payment for network and acquired programmes, and the implementation of
the programme plans which UTV had submitted as part of its licence
application.
They also noted that the improvement in profits was after deducting a half
year pro-rata cash bid charge of Pounds 516,000 compared with an exceptional
levy charge of Pounds 90,000.
The interim dividend is being lifted by 2p to 6.25p from earnings of 11.79p
(10.22p).

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ashanti to seek London listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHANTI Goldfields, owned jointly by the Ghanaian government and Lonrho, the
international trading conglomerate, is to seek a London listing next year
which could value it at up to Pounds 900m.
The Ghanaian government, which owns 55 per cent of the mine, has decided to
sell about one quarter of its stake. Lonrho, which manages the mine and owns
45 per cent, has decided not to sell any shares.
The sale will be Ghana's biggest sell-off exercise to date. It had recently
called for interested bids from mining companies and asked the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation to handle the sale.
But in the past few months it decided that a flotation would raise more. It
held a 'beauty parade' of merchant banks last week to advise it on the sale.
These included Morgan Grenfell with stockbrokers James Capel and UBS.
Mr Emmanuel Agbodo, the head of Ghana's privatisation programme, recently
said Ashanti was 'conservatively valued' at Pounds 500m. But the merchant
banks competing to advise the government on the flotation believe it could
be worth up to Pounds 900m.
Following the takeover of Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson, the Anglo-US
conglomerate, in 1989, the banks believe there could be 'significant
interest' in what will be the first big new listing of a gold mine.
However, they will have to overcome doubts about the stability of the
Ghanaian economy and overseas dividend remittance.
Ashanti had a good first half, with gold production amounting to 380,000
ounces - 16 per cent up on last year. Lonrho has said that projected
production for the year at 760,000 ounces is ahead of target.
Lonrho will retain operational control of the mines.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: A ripening target for a takeover
bid - Fyffes has turned from potential predator to prey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO years ago, Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit distributor, looked to be on
the verge of a significant expansion into the European mainland market as it
raised IPounds 60.2m in a rights issue and took on a new chief executive, Mr
John Callaghan.
For many investors, these were signals that the McCann family, which had run
the company since they bought it from United Brands in 1986, were preparing
to take Fyffes into the European big league of fruit distribution alongside
US majors such as Chiquita and Dole, which control almost two-thirds of the
'dollar' banana market in Europe.
'In the future we will be making fewer, but larger deals . . . attractive
opportunities come in bigger packages, said Mr Carl McCann, the group
finance director at the time.
Two years on, several efforts to make big acquisitions have failed. The
Fyffes warchest, totalling IPounds 90m, remains largely unspent and Fyffes
itself became in April the target of a takeover offer by Dole, which was
rejected by the board.
Then last month Mr Callaghan resigned with no clear explanation being given
to shareholders.
The stock market's exasperation with the company is growing. 'The lack of
information on a matter of such importance is a shameful disgrace for a
publicly-quoted company,' said one analyst.
The main interpretation in Dublin is that Mr Callaghan found that he was
given less freedom of action than he had anticipated when he joined the
group. Mr Neil McCann, the executive chairman, and his sons Carl and David,
hold the principal posts in the group, and - the argument goes - were
unwilling to cede executive control to Mr Callaghan.
Another view is that the McCanns simply came to the conclusion that Mr
Callaghan's accountancy background was not necessarily the best suited for
heading a fresh fruit trading business.
Either way, the incident has been a big embarrassment for the company, and
undermined investor confidence in the management team, which has still to
appoint a replacement chief executive.
Fyffes' fleeting interest earlier this year in purchasing a stake in
Greencore, the Irish sugar, milling and malting group, also also raised
questions over management strategy, and whether it is as committed to
building a Europe-wide fruit distribution network as it says it is.
It is thought that the McCanns might instead choose to spend their cash on
an agricultural trader outside their core fruit and vegetable business.
The company's cash is invested mostly in Irish financial assets, and with
interest rates now forecast to dip as low as 5 per cent by the year-end,
pressure will be mounting on the company to spend the warchest on a big
acquisition.
In its results for the first half to April, half of the IPounds 14m pre-tax
profits came from interest income - a result which will not be repeated in
the second half.
Mr Joe Gill, a food industry analyst at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin, notes:
'With interest income set to decline, Fyffes will require a strong recovery
in operating profits or acquisition-driven profits to attain earnings growth
in 1994.'
So with stagnating performance, no significant acquisition on the horizon,
and retrenchment taking place in the Dublin headquarters, Fyffes looks like
a ripening target for a new takeover bid.
Dole's April offer, the first for Fyffes since the McCanns took over, valued
the company at IPounds 420m, or IPounds 1.15 per share, a six-year high at
the time. The Fyffes board unanimously rejected the bid, but was careful not
to brand it as hostile.
Enough hints were dropped around the market that some of the key
shareholders would be sellers at the right price.
One of those is considered to be DCC, the Dublin-based holding company
headed by Mr Jim Flavin. DCC has an 11 per cent shareholding, the largest
single holding, and although Mr Flavin is a long-term supporter of the
McCanns he is also committed to developing DCC as an industrial holding
company.
Fyffes stands to benefit under the new EC banana import regime, which came
into force in July, being an importer from both the Central and South
American 'dollar' banana area as well as from the traditional African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries, which enjoy tariff-free entry to the EC.
The new regime will allow Fyffes to pick up market share from Chiquita, Dole
and Del Monte, the main players in the 'dollar' sector of the European
banana market.
Its strong cash position and good European growth prospects make the group a
potentially attractive company, especially to the big US players.
Chiquita, currently facing large capital expenditure commitments, and
posting a loss last year of Dollars 284m, is not considered a likely bidder,
and would most certainly be regarded as hostile.
Del Monte is still bedding in under its new Mexican owners, and so Dole
remains the most likely contender.
Ms Patricia Fee, an analyst for BCP stockbrokers in Dublin, says that
Fyffes' current share price, of IPounds 1.05, has a renewed bid by Dole
priced in, although she said she does not anticipate an antagonistic bid.
'Dole is dependent upon Fyffes for its sales in the UK market and will not
want to prejudice those,' she said.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Roxboro to join market with
Pounds 70m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROXBORO, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic
components, plans to come to market through an offer and placing next month
which is expected to value the group at about Pounds 70m.
The company grew out of the Pounds 29m management buy-out of the electronic
components division, Cambridge Electronic Industries (now Graseby), in
mid-1990. The buy-out, led by Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief executive, was
backed by Schroder Ventures.
After the 'back-to-back' sale of the capacitor business for Pounds 9m to its
management, Mr Tee has refocused Roxboro away from low-margin commodity
components and towards production of higher-margin value-added devices. At
the same time productivity has been improved and the workforce cut from
1,200 to 650.
The group, which has operations in the UK and US, recorded profits before
tax and interest of Pounds 4.3m last year on turnover of about Pounds 36m.
Interim results will be published in a few weeks, however Mr Tee says that
profitability in the current year is 'substantially' ahead of last year.
In the US the group's existing operations have been restructured and
consolidated into one plant at Roxboro, North Carolina which is a leading
third party supplier of electro-optical indicators using LEDs (Light
Emitting Diodes).
These indicators, sold under the Dialight brand, are used extensively
throughout the telecommunications, data communications and processing
markets, and in the diversified industrial controls market.
Because of their long life they are also increasingly replacing conventional
light bulbs in control panels and displays.
In Britain, Roxboro's two plants at Newmarket and Harlow manufacture
specialist electromagnetic devices including relays, solenoids and filters
which are sold under the Belling Lee and PED brands, mainly to the
telecommunications, instrumentation and industrial markets.
One new growth application for these devices is in the new generation of
'smart' utility meters for controlling electricity, gas and water supplies.
Roxboro also designs and builds custom components for companies such as
Schlumberger and Motorola.
'We have deliberately positioned ourselves as the number one two or three in
our chosen markets,' said Mr Tee.
Following the flotation the management is expected to retain about a 20 per
cent stake in the enlarged company, which will then have a debt-free balance
sheet. Mr Peter Smithan, a senior partner of Schroders Ventures will remain
chairman of the group and two non-executive directors are expected to join
the board.
The issue will be sponsored by Samuel Montague with James Capel as brokers
and the stock is expected to begin trading early in November.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Accounting board shelves rent
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Accounting Standards Board has shelved a proposal to force companies to
make a provision in their accounts for unrecoverable rent on vacant
leasehold property.
The proposal, which was put forward by the ASB's Urgent Issues Task Force in
June, would have required companies to identify the likely shortfall between
their obligations under their lease and the amount they would be likely to
recover by reletting the property. It had been expected to have a large
impact on some companies in London and the south east.
The British Property Federation, which represents landlords, said it had
opposed the proposals because it could discourage people from taking out a
long lease for fear of having to account for space that was not used at a
later date. It had the 'potential to inflict serious damage on the property
investment industry,' it said.
It also said that the proposal would have made it difficult to compare
figures in different companies' accounts because the provision would have
depended on assumptions about a large number of variables.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Plan that avoids expensive
mistakes - A look at the remaining clouds on Fisons' horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST 18 months have not been kind to Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and
scientific equipment group.
A series of apparently endless regulatory problems, culminating in the
withdrawal in the US of some of its best-selling products, the subsequent
resignation of its chairman, and a drubbing from the stock market which
ended with the company dropping out of the FT-SE 100 Index, have all cast
doubt over the future independence of the group.
However, Mr Cedric Scroggs, Fisons' increasingly confident new chief
executive, believes his team, which last week announced an improvement in
operating profits at the drugs division for the first time in nine months,
has answered most of the questions asked about the group's future as an
independent pharmaceuticals company.
The regulatory problems appear, at least for the moment, to be over. Mr
Scroggs points out that Fisons has shown for the last six months that it can
meet the regulators' rigorous standards.
The question whether the company has sufficient scale to discover, develop
and market new drugs, has also been mostly answered, says Mr Scroggs.
He adds that on the marketing side, strategic alliances in the US with
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer for Tilade, the asthma treatment, and Allergan, a US
group, to co-market Acular, the main competitor to Fisons' withdrawn product
Opticrom, have shown the way forward.
The company is now looking to license in a number of compounds. One will
take the place of Tipredane, Fisons' asthma treatment where development was
halted in April because of lack of efficacy. Mr Mike Redmond,
pharmaceuticals managing director, says the US sales force will have spare
capacity after next year and most of the other salesforces are
under-utilised at present.
Fisons refuses to say which companies it has approached or the type of
anti-asthmatic it wants to licence in. Mr Redmond says Fisons is not
interested in a beta2-agonist, the most common form of asthma treatment.
In the meantime, Fisons' development capability has improved considerably,
says Mr Redmond. Historically, Fisons has been one of the best places to do
research in the UK pharmaceuticals industry, but its track record on
development has been lamentable.
The decision to cancel development of Tipredane even has its brighter side,
insists Mr Redmond. In the past, the decision whether to cancel would have
been put off. Now, the development process has been improved so that
decisions are made earlier to avoid expensive mistakes.
In addition, the development of Tipredane has provided Fisons with
invaluable experience in developing a product simultaneously around the
world, explains Mr Redmond. Tilade was first launched in the UK in 1985, and
is yet to filed with the regulatory authorities in Japan. Tipredane would
have rolled out within only a few years.
The increasing willingness to collaborate with other companies means Fisons
will also sign a co-development agreement with another group for remacemide,
its product for epilepsy, an area in which the company has little expertise.
The agreement will reduce the risks for Fisons.
For the longer term, Mr Redmond intends to license-in further asthma
products at early stages of development. Innovative medicines such as
paf-antagonists and leukotriene antagonists are possible areas for
development.
Zeneca of the UK and Upjohn of the US are working on leukotriene
antagonists. Schering-Plough, the American group, is working on a
paf-antagonist. Roche of Switzerland is working in both areas.
Mr Redmond says Fisons can offer expertise in clinical research and delivery
system. A number of companies are interested in using its patented
multi-dose dry powder inhaler clinical trials. In addition, any partner
could eventually use Fisons' sales forces.
Clouds remain on the Fisons' horizon. The US patents for the nebulised
version of Intal, an asthma product and one of its best-selling drugs,
expired in August. This version represents about half of the drug's US
sales. In addition, an FDA advisory committee will decide next week whether
generic companies will be able to launch versions of the inhaled version
without doing clinical trials.
In the meantime, Mr Scroggs must turn his attention to the underperforming
scientific instruments operations which fell into a loss during the first
six months.
He admits the loss, likely to be repeated in the second half, is all the
more galling because he was in charge of the business before he was
appointed chief executive. 'It's a very nasty episode,' he admits.

FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Badgerline accelerates up the
takeover trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BADGERLINE Group, the bus operator which is coming to the stock market in
November, has expanded rapidly by acquisitions in the seven years since a
group of managers and employees succeeded in a Pounds 3m buy-out of the
National Bus Company subsidiary.
It has taken over no fewer than seven other former NBC operations in a
strategy similar to that pursued by other fast-growing operators such as
Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator which came to the market in April,
and Drawlane Transport Group.
Of the 62 NBC companies sold to management buy-out teams, a large number
have subsequently lost their independence. As a result, the Department of
Trade and Industry has expressed anxiety over the rate at which small bus
companies have been swallowed up, reducing the competition promised by the
break-up of the NBC.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, Badgerline's chairman, said that the position was
monitored by the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Problems only arose in particular local areas and had been
solved by giving assurances to the regulatory authorities. He believed there
was still scope for further consolidation.
Badgerline is one of the few companies to have expressed an interest in
running some of British Rail's bigger operations, if they are privatised. Mr
Smallwood said he was still interested in principle, but would need much
more knowledge of the terms before making a decision.
The group, which runs 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands, south Wales
and the southern England, is also interested in bidding for local authority
bus services as they are sold off and in offering services in London. It
already runs 70 Thamesway buses servicing south Essex.
About 1,000 of Badgerline's 6,200 employees currently own about 90 per cent
of the group's shares. Each year the original shares are traded among
employees on a 'matched-bargain' basis. At the last auction, in April,
shares originally worth 3.3p fetched Pounds 3.20.
The final value of the shares will not be settled until the structure of the
flotation is agreed, but they are likely to be worth significantly more than
Pounds 3.20.
The flotation will be sponsored by Lazard Brothers, and Cazenove will act as
brokers.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Murdoch sells HK newspaper stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday agreed to sell 34.9 per cent
of South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper,
to Malaysian-born billionaire Mr Robert Kuok.
The deal - valued at Dollars 349m (Pounds 227m) - puts one of Hong Kong's
few remaining independent newspapers into the hands of an influential Asian
businessman. Mr Kuok is well known in Hong Kong for his pro-China
sympathies.
Mr Stephen Brown, director of HG Asia, a large local stockbroker, said: 'I
cannot read anything but politics, and the big hand of Beijing, in this
deal.' Mr Kuok has no previous experience of investment in newspapers.
There is little doubt in Hong Kong that the Chinese government will be
pleased to see a corporate ally taking effective control of what is arguably
Hong Kong's most influential newspaper.
The SCMP shares are being sold at around HKDollars 5.18 per share, against
the last traded price of HKDollars 5.35. Mr Murdoch will retain 15.1 per
cent of the newspaper.
SCMP is one of the most profitable newspapers in the world. News Corp
purchased the company in 1987; assuming the remaining 15 per cent is sold at
current prices, Mr Murdoch will have earned more than HKDollars 5bn (Pounds
418m) on his HKDollars 2.4bn six-year investment.
The capital raised from the latest sale will cover 66 per cent of the
acquisition cost of Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster Star TV, purchased
by Mr Murdoch in July for Dollars 525m. The two transactions are widely
interpreted as showing a switch in Mr Murdoch's focus from print to
electronic media.
The purchasing company is Kerry Media, an associate of Mr Kuok's Hong Kong
flagship company Kerry Group; the remainder of Kerry Media is owned by other
Kuok-controlled companies. By purchasing a stake of below 35 per cent, Mr
Kuok avoids having to make a general offer for the company.
It had been anticipated that there would be some Singaporean involvement in
the deal However, Straits Press and United Overseas Bank already own 14 per
cent of SCMP, and any further purchases in concert with Mr Kuok would have
triggered an offer for the entire company.
This will raise expectations that Straits Press may acquire part of Mr
Murdoch's remaining interest in the company. The Singaporean newspaper
publisher is anxious to build up its regional publishing interests and would
provide a useful partner for Mr Kuok, given his lack of media expertise.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Canadian utility faces part sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO Hydro, one of North America's biggest power utilities and one of the
largest borrowers in the Eurobond market, is laying the groundwork for a
partial privatisation to help ease its acute financial condition.
The Toronto-based utility at present relies entirely on debt financing, and
has amassed borrowings of more than CDollars 34bn (Pounds 16.7bn). 'We
simply cannot any longer tolerate 100 per cent debt financing, we simply do
not have enough equity,' said Mr Maurice Strong, chairman.
Mr Strong said that Hydro, which is owned by the Ontario provincial
government, is preparing a financial restructuring which will include 'very
fundamental changes'.
He indicated that these may include opening the door to outside equity
participation.
The province's left-of-centre New Democratic government has up to now been
reluctant to endorse private ownership of Hydro. However, Mr Strong said
that 'the issue isn't privatisation; the issue is financial flexibility'.
Mr Strong, who organised last year's United Nations Earth Summit, has
launched a far-reaching shake-up at Hydro since he took over as chairman
last December.
As part of an austerity plan announced earlier this year, the utility has
set a goal of reducing borrowings by a third over the next decade, and
trimming its debt-equity ratio from the present 83:17 to about 60:40.
It has chopped its capital spending budget, and is also cutting 6,000 of its
29,000 jobs, and splitting its operations into three separate business
units.
Hydro expects to suffer a loss of at least CDollars 1.6bn this year,
including an operating loss of about CDollars 200m. It cited slack demand
for electricity, write-offs related to restructuring, and continuing
problems at a nuclear power station.
The shake-up is a response to growing concern among electricity users at the
steep hike in rates, which has averaged 7.3 per cent a year since 1988.
Cheap power has in the past been one of the chief drawcards for investors in
Ontario.
Mr Strong has pledged to freeze Hydro's rates next year, and to hold
increases for the rest of the 1990s no higher than Canada's inflation rate.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: Growth industry in analysing output
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Productivity figures rarely make the headlines. When they are next issued in
the UK on Thursday, the figures - giving output per head - are likely to be
overshadowed by the latest unemployment news published the same day.
But recent official reports, pointing to strong productivity growth in UK
and US manufacturing industry, have caught the attention of economists.
Higher productivity is to be expected during economic recovery as orders
flow in and capacity utilisation rises. But output growth per head in US and
UK manufacturing industry has been particularly strong when set against the
hesitant and patchy recovery in the US and the moderate growth of British
production.
As productivity is such an important indicator of a nation's underlying
economic strength, these trends raise the question as to whether or not the
present recovery is qualitatively different from earlier economic upturns.
Figures last month from Britain's Department of Employment showed
productivity in manufacturing was 8.2 per cent higher in the second quarter
than in the same period of 1992: much faster growth than the 3.1 per cent
rise in manufacturing output in the same period.
The US Commerce Department reported last week that output per head in
manufacturing grew by an annualised 5.2 per cent in the second quarter and
by 7.7 per cent in that part of industry making durable goods: an intriguing
development considering that the US administration has revised down its
economic growth forecasts.
Admittedly, broader measures of productivity have performed less well in
both countries. The most recent UK figures show year-on-year productivity
growth of 4 per cent across the whole economy in the first quarter. The US,
perhaps reflecting the recent uneven nature of its recovery, reported a
seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent annualised fall in non-farm productivity in
the second quarter, revised from earlier estimates of a 2.5 per cent
decline.
There is also no consensus among economists about the meaning of recent
productivity trends. In a recent paper published by the Brookings
Institution of Washington, two distinguished US scholars, George L. Perry
and Charles L. Schultze, discovered a notable development in US productivity
last year. They said that after six quarters of recovery, non-farm
productivity in the US rebounded past previous trend growth (by 1.6 per cent
at an annual rate) even though US gross domestic product had been stagnant.
But, while describing this as a 'striking fact', they were unable to reach a
conclusion if this marked a surprise break with established patterns.
Others are less cautious. Mrs Sylvia Ostry, head of the Centre for
International Studies at the University of Toronto and a former chief
economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
Paris, believes that far-reaching structural changes may be bringing the US
'close to a higher growth trajectory'.
She suggests that the strong manufacturing productivity growth could reflect
technological change, especially in information and communications
technology, and investment by multinational corporations. These forces have
transformed production methods and organisation of companies.
Heavy lay-offs among US white collar workers and the exceptional increase of
sales of computer equipment, which doubled between the end of 1989 and the
first quarter of this year, are symptoms of this transformation which has
been under way in manufacturing over the past decade, she contends.
Mrs Ostry believes that the services sector is about to experience similar
changes. Such changes involve costs: job losses among previously highly paid
middle managers could help explain why consumption has been so weak in
America. But eventually the greater productivity growth should benefit the
economy and give the US a new edge over international competitors.
Some City economists see echoes of the US experience in Britain. Writing in
this month's Gerrard and National Monthly Economic Review, Professor Tim
Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research and one of the
chancellor's seven-man panel of independent forecasters, says UK
manufacturing productivity 'is doing well, much better than would normally
be expected from previous cyclical patterns'.
UK companies appear to be importing state-of-the-art machinery and copying
best practices abroad, while foreign companies are investing in Britain to
take advantage of relatively cheap labour, he says.
Two economists at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, Mr Albert Edwards
and Mr David Owen, say British industry has followed the US example of
investing heavily in computer equipment that will facilitate corporate
restructuring.
Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets in London, expects
that increased investment as the UK economy recovers 'will introduce a vast
amount of new technology into industry and commerce'. With the British
labour market more flexible than at any time since the 1960s, resistance to
change in working practices is at historically low levels, he says.
As Prof Congdon points out, UK manufacturing productivity has been growing
strongly for some years. The average annual increase was 4.8 per cent
between 1979 and 1989, the highest level of any Group of Seven country.
Mr Smith believes that UK productivity growth for the whole economy will
hover around 2.75 per cent in the 1990s, and so be close to the very high
growth rates achieved in the 1960s and the early and mid-1980s.
But it needs to be. The gap in productivity between Britain and its main
international competitors is so large, that 'even if UK productivity growth
was consistently 1 per cent higher than other countries, it would be perhaps
15 to 20 years before the UK could catch up with France and Germany, and
more than 50 years before it could catch up with the US,' he says.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Foreign exchange dealers enter the 21st century: A look at
the growing competition in automated trading systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly a quarter of a century, Reuters, the news and information group,
has been the world leader in the provision of electronic trading systems for
banks which deal in currency markets. But this week, Reuters will find
itself in competition with some of its best clients, a consortium of the
most powerful banks in foreign exchange.
Both sides are about to enter battle by offering rival automated dealing
systems which can simulate the work done by brokers in the foreign exchange
market. The products they are pioneering may change the face of one of the
most actively traded financial markets in the world, one where global
turnover has reached Dollars 1,000bn a day.
Last year, Reuters launched its 2000-2 automated brokerage system after
several years developing it at an estimated cost of Pounds 60m. It was
followed in April by Minex - a service backed by Japanese institutions  -
much used in Asia.
On Wednesday, at 8am in London, dealers will be able to trade on terminals
run by the Electronic Broking Service (EBS). This system, which cost around
Pounds 40m to launch, has been backed by a dozen leading banks in foreign
exchange - such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan - who have formed a
consortium with Quotron, specialists in electronic information.
'This is where the 21st century begins for foreign exchange dealers,' says
Mr Peter Bartko, chairman of the EBS partnership. 'In the long term, people
have to accept that human brokerage doesn't have a great future.'
Brokerage still plays a considerable role in currency dealing. Roughly 60
per cent of deals in the currency markets are now done by traders in two
banks - or counterparties - who call one another up directly. The remainder
of deals are done through brokers, who bring together diverse buyers and
sellers.
Commercial banks rely on brokers for a good proportion of their business and
value their knowledge of the market. But they complain that the commissions
charged for broking a deal are very high.
Automated brokerage terminals do the same job as humans at a reduced cost. A
bank dealer using any of the three on offer can advertise a buy and sell
price on dealing screens across the globe. Another bank dealer then 'hits'
the price by typing instructions on to a terminal. Only when the deal is
done are the identities of both parties revealed.
The banks are attracted by the reduced cost of commission. But they fear
that 2000-2 will help Reuters monopolise the market in electronic dealing
systems. Mr Bartko admits that this is one of the principal motives for this
week's launch of EBS.
Reuters has 19,000 conventional dealing terminals in banks around the world.
On Mr Bartko's estimate, some 50 per cent of global foreign exchange
transactions take place on them. 'Reuters 2000-2 could move that figure
significantly higher,' he says.
He argues that the banks would be 'at the mercy' of Reuters if its control
of transactions jumped to 70 per cent. They would be in a position to
dictate customer charges. Some bank dealers also argue that Reuters could
change the structure of the currency market, if it so wished, by selling
more systems to non-banking customers who are becoming important movers of
international capital.
EBS has one advantage over rival systems: the banks backing it have 35 per
cent of turnover on the London foreign exchange market. That means EBS could
establish high levels of liquidity very quickly. Mr Bartko says liquidity is
the key to success. 'You need to have 50 banks using a system to make a
professional market in, say, the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate. We already
have the critical mass.'
By contrast, he says that Reuters 2000-2 cannot offer big volume deals in
the main currencies because the large banks have not moved over to using it.
But Reuters is confident. Mr Bob Etherington, the company's international
marketing manager, takes EBS seriously but dismisses fears that Reuters is
seeking to increase charges by monopolising the market. 'In the last 12
years, the prices for using the Reuters Monitor Dealing Service have not
kept up with inflation,' he said. 'We have not abused out position at all.'
Mr Etherington believes that 2000-2 will acquire greater liquidity, but he
will not reveal volume levels. 'From the start, we set targets for the
number of trades we wanted to see and we are meeting those targets.' He also
believes that it is far too early to judge the performance of 2000-2. 'It
takes a long time to establish these systems in the marketplace as we saw
with our earlier systems,' he says. 'You are asking dealers to start trading
in a way they have never traded before, and that can take time.'
Officials at EBS admit that Reuters has such huge resources that it can wait
to see how automated brokerage develops over many years. And the pioneers of
these systems know it will take a long time to bring currency dealers around
to using them.
One hindrance to automated brokerage is that traders must make a brokered
deal by looking at a screen and tapping buttons on a keyboard. That takes
longer than listening to the broker shouting a price on the phone and
answering 'done'. In a market where every second counts, that costs money.
Dealers are also nervous to offer a buy/sell price knowing that either side
of the price can be 'hit' by any currency dealer in the world. That is a
more frightening prospect than operating through a trusted broker or dealing
with a known counterparty, especially when exchange rates are volatile.
Automated currency brokerage may never catch on. But it may also be the dawn
of a Brave New World - a development no less significant than the launch of
the early computerised trading systems in currency markets in the 1970s. The
banks merely want to ensure that, if this is the technology of the future,
Reuters is not alone in developing it.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Carlton may buy into Independent publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Green, chair-man of Carlton Communications, is interested in
acquiring a stake in Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and
Independent on Sunday.
Mr Green, who began his career in printing, would like to add newspapers to
his television interests which include Carlton Television, holder of the
London weekday ITV licence.
The expression of interest from Mr Green, who is also chairman of
Independent Television News, is being put in the context of trying to
strengthen the opposition to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International and
challenging Mr Murdoch's ability to set the media agenda in the UK.
Carlton is only one of six potential investors who have expressed an
interest in taking a stake in Newspaper Publishing. The others include
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and Mirror Group
Newspapers.
Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper Publishing has made it clear his
first priority is to install a new chief executive before going ahead with a
refinancing that could involve raising up to Pounds 20m.
Carlton Communications would only seek a stake of around 30 per cent
although a 'Conrad Black clause' would also be sought. Mr Conrad Black
invested in the Daily Telegraph on condition that he would have right of
first refusal on any further fund raising. As a result he won control of the
Daily Telegraph.

FT  13 SEP 93 / British Steel may quit EC restructuring plan: Chairman wants
tougher action to curb state aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL may pull out of a plan to restructure the EC steel industry
unless the European Commission takes tougher action to curb state subsidies.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, will today
warn the Commission that the company may not contribute to a levy to finance
rationalisation among weaker producers because so little progress has been
made to cut subsidies to state-owned producers in Italy and Spain.
The levy is central to Commission plans to respond to recession in the
industry by cutting 30m tonnes of production capacity.
Mr Moffat will tonight warn Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for
competition, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, that the
restructuring plan could fail if a subsidies deal is not agreed by November.
He will be among a number of European steel industry leaders at a meeting in
Strasbourg called to discuss the Commission's plan to restructure the
industry.
The Commission had originally asked steel companies to offer capacity cuts
of 30m tonnes by September 30 to help reduce chronic overcapacity. But
private sector companies such as British Steel, and the German producers
Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, have held back, arguing it would be unfair for
them to offer production cuts while the level of state subsidies to their
competitors remained unsettled.
Officially the Commission still hopes it can reach a deal on subsidies in
time for the next EC industry ministers meeting on September 21. But with
negotiations with Italian and Spanish producers continuing, this looks
increasingly unlikely.
Mr Moffat warned that failure by the Commission to reach a satisfactory
agreement to cut state subsidies could cause bankruptcies in private sector
steel groups.
He remained hopeful that the Commission's problems clinching a deal to cut
state subsidies would only amount to 'three or four months of lost
momentum'.
Mr Moffat said subsidised producers were delaying reaching an agreement in
the hope that an economic upturn would ease the pressure on them to make
cuts. He said: 'The current situation is an excuse for doing nothing.'
British Steel was broadly in favour of the levy to help finance production
cuts over the next five years, Mr Moffat stressed. But he said the company
would not take part if the deal was not in its shareholders' interests.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Employers' group seeks review of labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH employment law is in urgent need of rationalisation because it has
become so complicated that it is imposing an excessive burden upon
companies, according to the Engineering Employers Federation.
The EEF, the UK's largest industrial employers' group, says in an internal
paper that legislation should be overhauled to strike 'a fair balance
between the employment rights of individuals and the requirement to promote
successful businesses'.
It is the furthest a leading employers' group has gone in arguing that UK
labour law should be put on a new footing.
The government last month passed its eighth important piece of employment
legislation since 1980 and the UK is accommodating a growing body of EC
employment legislation. Other employers' organisations, such as the
Institute of Directors, are pressing for further legislation.
The EEF paper reports a shift in employers' attitudes on labour law. It
refers to 'widespread feeling that employment law is becoming unduly
complicated and is imposing an excessive burden on companies'.
The EEF argues that legally backed codes of practice should supersede the
mix of statutory provision and case law. Such codes would bring the UK
closer to the codified systems of continental European labour law.
The paper says laws covering maternity rights, redundancy dismissals and the
EC-inspired Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) rules are
particularly complicated.
Another target is the industrial tribunal system, which, it says, 'is
getting bogged down with excessive delays, long hearings and legal
complexities'.
Mr Peter Reid, head of employment policy at the EEF, and one of the paper's
main authors, said simpler and clearer laws would benefit both employees and
employers.

FT  13 SEP 93 / California tax changes likely to lift UK retaliation threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIAN tax legislation passed at the weekend is expected to lift the
threat of British action against Californian-based companies operating in
the UK.
However, the bill, which was approved in the California state assembly late
Friday night, as yet leaves unresolved the court battle by Barclays Bank
against the state's unitary tax system.
Barclays' action is the test case for suits which could cost California a
total of about Dollars 880m (Pounds 570m). Another Dollars 3.1bn is at stake
in a related suit brought by Colgate-Palmolive, which would extend to
US-owned companies.
The new legislation is likely to remove the principal remaining objections
of foreign-owned companies to the state's tax system, which they argue has
discriminated against them, and leave them free to choose an alternative
system of tax assessment known as 'water's edge'.
Foreign, and especially British, companies have long objected to
California's unitary system, which taxes a company on a percentage of its
worldwide income, rather than only on income earned in the state. Since this
system differs from international norms, it can be disallowed by tax
authorities in other countries and lead to a company's being taxed twice on
the same income.
Due to international pressure, California has since 1988 allowed companies
to opt for 'water's edge' assessment, which includes only activities within
the US.
In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is not expected to make a
statement until the Treasury has studied the bill, but US officials are
confident the legislation does enough to justify the lifting of the
retaliation threat.
The retaliation, announced in May, is due to come into effect on January 1.
It would remove a tax credit from Californian companies, effectively
increasing the tax rate on their UK subsidiaries from 28 per cent to 33 per
cent, costing them up to Pounds 250m a year.
Major US companies have lobbied California hard to change its law and avert
the UK retaliation.
UK finance directors yesterday welcomed the legislation's approval, but
cautiously.
ICI, which has extensive interests in California, said: 'This move is
broadly welcome but we are looking at the new arrangements to see whether
they remove all our concerns.'
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'The Californian legislature has passed a bill which, although it does
not totally repeal unitary tax provisions, positively improves the tax code
in the way the CBI has been advocating.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch has been so busy snapping up assets in recent months that
it goes against the grain for him to sell out of one of the world's most
profitable newspaper groups. Presumably not even he fancied his chances of
trying to preserve the South China Morning Post's editorial and advertising
appeal after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Besides, the
returns made on the original HKDollars 2.4bn investment would have been
enough to tempt anyone to cash in their chips.
The sale of a 34.9 per cent stake to the pro-Beijing Mr Robert Kuok ensures
a full bid will not be sparked for SCMP. But this leaves News Corporation
with an untidy rump of shares to sell. This would appear a straightforward
enough task given that SCMP's shares have more than doubled to HKDollars
5.35 over the past two years. Then again, other investors may well reflect
on the risks of owning shares in an English-language newspaper at such a
politically-sensitive time. Significantly, News Corporation is choosing to
recycle its proceeds into regional satellite television, which skirts such
regulatory worries.

FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK superstores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Tesco tees up to start the food retailers' reporting season, attention
will once again fix on the valuations ascribed to their vast property
portfolios. James Capel calculates that, between them, the big three grocers
own some Pounds 8.4bn of properties. This compares with Pounds 8.6bn owned
by Land Securities, MEPC and British Land. Recent fears about the
sustainability of grocers' margins and return on capital, however,
increasingly call into question whether superstore assets should be
depreciated over their useful lives.
So far, Wm Morrison has been the only food retailer to respond to such
concerns - although depreciating its land and buildings by just 1 per cent a
year seems little more than cosmetic. The worry is that if food retailers do
not steadily depreciate their assets they may be forced to take big one-off
write-downs. By bidding up the cost of sites, the big grocers have had to
work harder to maintain their return on capital. They have achieved this by
widening their trading margins. If margins now come under pressure, the
capital value of their sites may also fall. Should not that risk be
reflected in their books?
Arguably, superstore land may preserve much of its value over 15 to 25
years, especially if inflation returns, but the case for depreciating
buildings over their useful lives appears overwhelming. Even this move would
have a material impact on grocers' earnings, reducing some of them by as
much as 15 per cent. Investors, though, scarcely need further encouragement
to sell. The sector has under-performed the market by 18 per cent since the
start of the year.

It looks as though 1993 will go down in exchange market history as another
year in which the pundits got the dollar badly wrong. Far from appreciating
as the US economy recovered, the dollar looks distinctly sick on the basis
of a weak recovery and extraordinarily low inflation. In Europe, the
Bundesbank has cut rates more slowly than many expected and is under even
less pressure to do so now that the ERM has moved to 15 per cent bands. Last
week's cut of just 10 basis points in the money market repurchase rate is a
reminder that it is keen to see policy relatively restrictive and the D-Mark
strong.
The result is that the transatlantic interest rate differential has failed
to narrow as much as had been assumed at the start of the year. Now, with US
equities looking expensive and bonds at record low yields, there is not much
to attract international money into the dollar - hence the growing sense
that it has room to weaken further. This will not help economic recovery in
Europe, where currencies as a whole have tended to be overvalued against the
dollar.
The policy response will be interesting to watch. It is difficult to be sure
how far the D-mark's present strength is a function of the dollar and how
far it reflects purchases by central banks obliged to repay intervention. A
pronounced fall in the dollar might just provoke the Bundesbank into larger
interest rate cuts designed to offset the implicit monetary tightening. That
would let France and other ERM countries off the hook. It is more likely,
though, that they will still have to undercut German rates interest
eventually. The hope would be that an inflow of foreign funds into their
bond markets would provide the wherewithal to repay the intervention debt.

FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Steely determination
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to see why British Steel is anxious to move the European steel
debate forward. Subsidies protect its state-owned competitors in Europe from
the economic downturn, while depressed continental demand robs it of the
benefits of rationalisation. The levy proposal, whereby privatised producers
would contribute towards the cost of shutting down capacity at state-owned
loss-makers, may appear unorthodox to competition policy purists, but
British Steel can well afford to participate. The incentive to do so is all
the greater since real discipline will be even harder to impose on subsidies
once the recovery starts. The problem would then be worse again in the next
downturn.
Participation in the levy need not affect the company's low gearing.
Contributions would come out of revenue over a period of five years. Given
British Steel's high operational gearing, the effect on the profit and loss
account would presumably be quickly offset by higher prices and higher
volumes. Its relatively modest capital spending requirements mean the cash
outlay should not hurt.
The longer term risk is that once the west European capacity problem is
resolved it will be harder for the EC to find an excuse for restricting
cheap imports from eastern Europe. The short-term risk is that the
discipline imposed on state-owned producers will prove inadequate. British
Steel is, though, probably right to claim that, without action soon, the
outlook for private sector producers is bleak. Most at risk are companies in
Germany and Benelux which stand to suffer an exchange rate disadvantage from
the collapse of the ERM. But any collapse there would be scant consolation
since the Klockner experience shows that private sector troubles do not
necessarily lead to closure of capacity.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Trading with Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME has come for the United States to establish normal relations with
Vietnam. The war against Ho Chi Minh ended 18 years ago; west Europeans did
not wait half as long after the death of Hitler before starting to do
business with the Federal Republic of Germany. Admittedly there are
difficulties specific to America. Vietnam has not become a peace-loving
democracy, as west Germany did. Some US veterans cannot forget that their
forces were unable to defeat a third-world army. Such nightmares are not
easily exorcised.
Yet if South Africans can negotiate the handover of power from white to
black, and Israel can recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation, it
should be possible for President Clinton to complete the slow process of
reconciliation that was initiated by his predecessor. Mr Clinton could
demonstrate such an intent by allowing the embargo on US trade with Vietnam
to lapse tomorrow.
All the pieces are in place. Just before he left office, President George
Bush amended the embargo to allow companies to sign contracts with and open
offices in Hanoi, in anticipation that the ban on doing business with this
former enemy would eventually lapse. Large US corporations, including IBM,
General Electric, BankAmerica, Citibank, and Caterpillar have shown
interest; most of them have already set up shop in Vietnam. American
business is not saying 'hell no, we won't go.' On July 2 Mr Clinton lifted
the US veto on lending to Hanoi by the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and like institutions. On July 18 the first US diplomat sent to
the Vietnam capital in 40 years arrived, albeit accompanied by a statement
from Washington to the effect that his sole purpose was to help account for
US servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA).
Intimations that in spite of all this Mr Clinton may be hesitating at the
next hurdle are only partly explained by the president's record as a
youthful opponent of the war. The MIA theme, which arouses strong emotions,
is played upon by Mr Ross Perot, who may re-emerge as a future presidential
candidate. Many veterans and ex-prisoners, including a significant group in
Congress, have accepted that Hanoi is co-operating in efforts to trace MIAs
 -but some organisations, notably the American Legion, persist in their
opposition to an early resumption of trade with Vietnam.
Mr Clinton, whose priorities are health care reform and the North American
free trade area negotiations, is understandably cautious about this
south-east Asian hornets' nest. He is anxious to avoid further defeats in
Congress. The psychological damage done to the American nation by its
experiences, at home and abroad, during the Vietnam struggle runs deep. Yet
in June he stood before the Vietnam veterans' memorial and said
disagreements over a war fought two decades ago should not divide Americans
as a people any longer. He must now find the courage of his convictions.

Those who believed LWT when it called the new telly tycoons its most
cherished staff were perhaps a little too gullible.
In case you've forgotten, these were the 54 managers who invested in the
station's golden handcuffs scheme ahead of the franchise auction in 1991.
Some became paper millionaires last month when their shares became
tradeable.
Under the scheme's terms, they could not resign and hold on to their share
options. But it appears they could still be made redundant; six months ago
Alan Woolfson, the visual services controller, became an 'involuntary
leaver'. He has retired to enjoy a nest-egg coming to the boil at around
Pounds 900,000.

'I could write a book' runs the old Rodgers &amp; Hart tune. If former IMRO
chairman George Nissen should choose to do so he won't have far to look for
a publisher - he's just bought one.
Nissen, who fell on his sword in June 1992 in the wake of the Maxwell
scandal, has acquired The Book Guild, one of the UK's subscription
publishers.
Unkind fellow publishers not in the subscription game sometimes refer to it
as 'vanity' publishing; the author pays the publisher to bring out the book.
Not all authors write with the single aim of making a profit, says Nissen,
whose company brings out up to 100 titles annually, with print runs as low
as 500 copies.
Now if he could be persuaded to sit down and pen his own recent experiences,
demand might be a little greater than that.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former president Habib Bourguiba could be forgiven for thinking there is
some poetic justice in the fact that the first news of the mutual
recognition between Israel and the PLO came from Tunis.
As Tunisian head of state during 1957-87, Bourguiba tried to convince his
peers that they would fail to undo what the UN had done; in other words,
they would have to recognise Israel.
In Jericho (then part of Jordan) 28 years ago, Bourguiba propounded what he
called the 'doctrine of stages'.
This suggested that the Palestinians should recognise Israel and seek to
restore their lost rights by negotiation rather than by war - which they
were bound to lose.
For his prescience he was burned in effigy around the Arab world; Nasser
plotted to topple him.

Observer is surprised to learn that the starting salary for a cook at the
New York Times' staff cafeteria, at Dollars 697 a week, is rather more than
that for a journalist at the FT's competitor, the Wall Street Journal.
This intriguing disparity has been uncovered by the Independent Association
of Publishers' Employees, the union which represents 2,000 employees at Dow
Jones, publishers of the Wall Street Journal.
The IAPE is negotiating a new three-year pay contract with Dow Jones
management.
It suggests the disparity between the cooks' and the reporters' salaries
supports its proposal to the company's shareholders that any increase in the
chief executive's remuneration package should be no more than that received
by employees.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Observer: Political prayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the flurry of recently published political memoirs by eminent Tories -
Nigel Lawson, Alan Clarke, Kenneth Baker and soon from the lady herself -
there is scant practical guidance for the would-be member of parliament.
That gap is partly filled by a new publication from another long-serving
Tory, Ivor Stanbrook, Conservative member for Orpington between 1970-92. He
has brought out a timely tome: 'How To Be an MP'.
The book explains why MPs sometimes appear a rather religious bunch,
regularly attending prayers at the start of each day's proceedings.
'Apart from any spiritual value, the practical benefit derived from
attending prayers is the right it gives to a member to occupy a particular
seat in the chamber for the rest of the day, provided he is present at
prayers and inserts a prayer card in the seat.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Observer: Banking on Basle?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bank governors from the G-10 countries today turn their minds to the
difficult task of selecting a successor to Gerry Corrigan as chairman of the
Basle committee of international banking regulators.
Corrigan is stepping down after leaving his job as president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, but there has been no clear front-runner in the
search for his successor.
Some hot money is on Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, deputy director general of the
Bank of Italy, who has already had a stint at the EC in Brussels.
His appointment might provide some consolation for his failure to get the
job of governor, which was handed to Antonio Fazio in May this year.
Other international banking mandarins are whispering that the Dutch are
vying for a fresh grab at the top seat, though Corrigan's predecessor, the
late Huib Muller, was also from the Netherlands.
Brian Quinn, executive director responsible for banking supervision at the
Bank of England, might be considered an obvious candidate for the job.
But his chances have certainly been damaged by the fuss over the BCCI
affair. The fact that the first two Basle chairmen, Sir George Blunden and
Peter Cooke, were both from the UK, will also not help.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Now comes the hard part: A look at the wider implications of
the deal between the Palestinians and Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long after the hullabaloo surrounding today's peace deal between Israel and
the Palestinians fades, one image may linger in Middle Eastern minds: that
of a lonely farmhouse in the Norwegian countryside outside Oslo.
It was in such a place - or a number of such places - that senior officials
from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation set out earlier this
year towards their historic agreements on mutual recognition and on
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, conquered by Israel
in 1967.
Although assisted by low-key Norwegian mediators, they did it in direct
talks, without the participation or knowledge of any of the powerful
outsiders, from the US, Europe or the moderate Arab states, who have
expended such vast amounts of time and energy in seeking a settlement to the
Middle East's most intractable conflict.
Today, as the deal is consummated with a glitzy signing ceremony in
Washington, the discussions in that farmhouse seem a more telling pointer to
prospects for the wider region. The PLO and Israel had to look one another
in the eye, essentially in solitude, to begin to overcome decades of
hostility. So, too, the Israelis and the other Arab states - traditionally
obsessed by internecine rivalry, manipulation of external patrons and empty
rhetoric about Arab unity - are now on their own as they seek to chart a way
forward to peaceful co-existence.
That is the reality that underlies all the current hyperbole about a 'new
Middle East', Marshall Plans, high-level western involvement in furthering
the peace process, and ambitious regional public works programmes. Western
political and financial support can certainly help. But in the end, it is
the countries of the region that will determine whether the comprehensive
peace suddenly in prospect establishes a mood of trust and mutual dependence
rather than simply a grudging and irritable end to hostilities.
Perhaps more urgently than at any time since the end of the first world war,
when Britain and France secretly connived to carve the region's present
nation states out of the Ottoman empire, these countries have to discover
what they have in common, and how they can live as normal neighbours.
As among the states of western Europe after world war two, the basis for
their co-operation will have to be economic as much as political. As in
Europe for four subsequent decades, any new order will in the eyes of Israel
and of some Arab governments be constantly subject to an ideological
challenge from within and without: that of militant Islam, both home-grown
and fomented from the east by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The question is: are the partners really prepared for peace, for the
regional integration this implies, and for the shift in strategic and
economic alliances with the world at large which will surely follow?
The Israeli government and business establishment evidently thinks so. Mr
Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister who brokered the deal with the PLO
in Oslo, has spoken of a 'new era' in regional co-operation with moderates
on both sides joining forces to foster economic growth and combat political
extremism, and is looking to the European Community to encourage regional
integration in a new association agreement. Expectations of the commercial
dividends peace could bring have fuelled a 10 per cent rise in the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange over the past two weeks, and have prompted a renewed flurry
of interest in Israel, notably on the part of European and Japanese
companies.
The euphoria is understandable, but premature. Today's signatures in
Washington merely begin the endgame of a peace which must be hammered out in
detail and sealed in treaties. Jordan, Syria and Lebanon have still to
accomplish their first steps along the road: agreement on declarations of
principles to guide their own talks.
Even when they have done so - and the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in
particular are likely to be slow and difficult - serious sources of
instability in the Middle East will remain unaddressed, notably the Gulf,
where Saddam Hussein's pariah state of Iraq has no part in the peace process
and Iran is fiercely opposed to it. The race to acquire arms of all kinds
continues unchecked all over the region, and could itself become a casus
belli if Israel feels compelled to act against efforts by its enemies to
acquire weapons of mass destruction.
It is hardly the most auspicious climate in which to embark on an experiment
in co-existence. That is, nevertheless, what Israel has set out to create.
The hope must be that it can lead through example by transforming its
relationship with the Palestinians. If it succeeds, change for the better
could radiate into the region, underpinned by the financial might of Gulf
states such as Saudi Arabia and by expanding international trade.
The Israelis and Palestinians are the critical test case. In agreeing on
self-rule for the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories, the
PLO and Israel have opted for a gradual separation between two peoples
locked for 26 years in unhappy and unequal marriage.
Provided they can keep their respective extremists in check, and provided Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, can effect a rapid and visible improvement in
economic conditions in the territories, there is a chance that the political
separation will eventually provide for a new relationship based on something
resembling mutual respect.
What the Palestinians cannot afford is a complete divorce. Their lives are
too closely intermingled with those of the Israelis. For the foreseeable
future they will continue to depend on salaries earned by Palestinian
workers in Israel, and they will need to maintain the freest of trading
links with their Jewish neighbours if the businessmen of the West Bank and
the diaspora are to be encouraged to invest in productive enterprises. The
extent to which they see potential returns rather than humiliation in such
heavy dependence on their much more powerful Israeli neighbour will in large
part determine whether their experiment succeeds.
The Palestinian proto-state will also be heavily dependent on the Kingdom of
Jordan to the east, next in line to sign a declaration of principles with
Israel. As well as establishing a free-trade zone with Israel, the
Palestinians will need liberal trading arrangements across the Jordan river
as a conduit to the wider Arab world. The next natural step would be free
trade between all three countries - even, Mr Peres has suggested, some form
of economic union a la Benelux. Such an agreement, however, will be hard to
achieve. A recent Harvard University report remarks that 'broad scale free
trade between Israel and Jordan would take longer, for Jordanian firms have
not until now been subject to Israeli competition'.
That is a foretaste of the problems ahead in dismantling the encrusted
barriers between Israel and the Arab world. The Israeli economy is twice the
size of that of its most powerful Arab neighbour, Egypt, although its
population is only one tenth as large. The Arab world has nothing resembling
the Jewish state's most dynamic companies. All Israel's relatively
impoverished neighbours will be very wary of allowing their economies to be
penetrated by such unsettling forces.
The sole precedent, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel, is distinctly
unpropitious in this regard. Trade and investment flows since have been
limited. As important, overall intra-Arab trade and investment is very
underdeveloped. For decades, the Middle East has been composed of siege
economies with their best talent and the best part of their national
resources devoted to war. The vast majority of Arab exports - whether of oil
from the Arabian peninsula or of potash, textiles and agricultural produce
from the Levant and North Africa - is sold to the industrial countries of
the US, Europe and Asia rather than locally. Capital accumulated in the Arab
world has a habit of taking flight to western financial centres rather than
being put to productive use at home.
Few Arab regimes have yet got far with structural reforms aimed at
invigorating their sclerotic economies. And none of their attempts at
creating a meaningful regional economic grouping has long survived the
political rivalries and frictions which have always eclipsed economic
considerations in their minds.
Arab suspicion of the Israeli embrace is epitomised by Syria, still engaged
in an arms build-up and in dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights,
captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel has yet to promise a complete
withdrawal from the Golan as demanded by Syria's President Hafez al-Assad.
He has not promised the 'full peace' - including an exchange of ambassadors
and free movement of goods and people - that Israel wants in return. The
danger, in Israeli eyes, is that an eventual treaty with Syria will in
practice be no better than the 'cold peace' with Egypt.
Mr Assad has concerns of his own: in particular, the maintenance of his own
power, embodied in one of the region's most repressive regimes. He has
recently shed much of his Baath party's quasi-socialist ideology to initiate
a cautious programme of economic reform. But this is a far cry from the sort
of economic opening that would be required under any broad attempt at
regional economic integration. Anything more radical might undermine his
military power base.
Syria epitomises another reason for caution about the prospects for a
comprehensive and durable Arab-Israeli peace: the uncertainty surrounding
the present generation of one-man Middle Eastern regimes. President Assad
has serious health problems, and the succession to him is impossible to
predict. There is a feeling of fin de regime, too, in Jordan, whose leader,
King Hussein, has recently been treated for cancer. He is busily striving to
ensure he will be succeeded by a more democratic form of constitutional
monarchy. But his kingdom has an unstable history and his subjects - divided
along fault lines of religion and origin - have largely been held together
by his personality. Since a majority of the population considers itself
Palestinian, any instability in the West Bank and Gaza would immediately
infect Jordan's body politic.
In Egypt, the most important and populous Arab country by far, the authority
of President Hosni Mubarak is not in immediate doubt. Next month, he is
expected to win a referendum and sail into a third, six-year term. But
there, too, stability is not guaranteed. Islamic extremism is on the march,
with fundamentalist groups conducting violent attacks on western tourists,
government ministers and security forces. The government's response has been
heavy-handed and unimaginative, and may simply be fuelling the problem.
The regime's difficulties are exacerbated by growing concern about its
relationship with its crucial patron, the US, expressed in Dollars 2.3bn
(Pounds 1.5bn) a year of financial and military aid. Paradoxically, a wider
Arab-Israeli agreement may diminish Washington's previous interest in Egypt
as the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel. Although the
Clinton administration has said it will assure this aid through to 1995,
there can be no guarantee it will be held at such levels thereafter. Without
the US bounty, Cairo's ability to maintain domestic stability and keep the
extremists in check would be open to serious question.
In these domestic political and economic problems in the Arab world lies
perhaps the most important reason why it is still too early to talk of a new
era of peace and economic co-operation in the Middle East. Income
disparities between the states of the region, and within them, remain potent
sources of conflict and provide nutrition for Islamic opposition to
unrepresentative Arab regimes. Iraq, still besieged by United Nations
sanctions, continues to fulminate against the wealthy, US-protected Gulf
states to its south. Iran, the most populous and powerful Gulf country, is
busy rebuilding its military after eight years of war with Iraq and has been
identified by Israel and its Arab partners as a serious source of trouble -
especially in its perceived influence over Islamic movements from Algiers to
Amman.
It is in the battle between such forces and the emergent Arab-Israeli
'alliance for peace' that the future of the region will be determined. Only
when it has been concluded will it be possible to tell whether today's
accord represents the first gasp of a new Middle Eastern order or a dying
gasp of the old.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nelson's task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL BRITISH businesses had a rough time during the recession. Many went
under when banks called in their loans. And although the banks have come in
for criticism for being too ready to pull the rug from under entrepreneurs'
feet, the losses on their lending to small companies show they too have not
fared well. With banks reluctant to extend more short-term finance to small
businesses, there is a danger the economic recovery will be blighted.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was therefore right last week to initiate
a review into the financing of industry. Small companies are excessively
reliant on short-term overdrafts, which can be called in at the first hint
of trouble. It would be better if they could raise longer term equity and
debt finance.
Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, who has been given the task of
conducting the review, will find no shortage of ideas as he tours the
country over the coming months. Business lobby groups have been quick to
trot out ideas such as increasing capital allowances for small companies.
Another idea came earlier this year from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank's
chief executive, who called on government to subsidise small business loans
and give tax relief on investment by individuals in industry.
Many of these suggestions smack of special pleading. Rather than devising
yet more tax reliefs and subsidies. Mr Nelson will probably find it more
fruitful to identify how current tax breaks distort investment flows.
If small businesses are to make greater use of venture capital, their
attitudes will have to change. At present, many entrepreneurs are not
willing to dilute their control by selling equity stakes to outsiders.
The way in which tax reliefs favour the institutionalisation of savings will
also merit attention. Once the nation's savings are sucked into large
institutions such as pension funds, they too seldom find their way to small
companies in the form of equity finance. It is not worth the management
effort of big institutions to invest in and monitor a large collection of
tiny projects. Such investments, though, might be just the thing for wealthy
individuals.
Any attempts to de-institutionalise savings will be contentious. When the
then Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor tried to do so in the 1980s, the powerful
pensions lobby scotched his plans. Since then, the government has trimmed
pensions tax relief in a piecemeal fashion, an approach which has had no
overall logic apart from raising cash for the exchequer.
The arguments for reforming the taxation of savings are finely balanced. But
there can be no radical change in the way companies are financed so long as
the institutionalisation of savings persists. The question is whether the
government has the stomach for a fundamental rethink.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Leading Article: UK labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN MAY or may not need another round of employment legislation, but it
urgently needs rationalisation of the law which already exists. That is the
message coming from Britain's engineering employers.
A sound framework of employment law would protect employers and employees
from unfair behaviour, without placing undue burdens on employers. The
rights and duties of both parties to the employment contract should be
expressed as clearly as possible.
The foundations of British employment law are still rooted in a law of
contract which requires many of the rights associated with collective
organisation to be expressed as immunities from breach of contract. Britain
has a system of 'collective laissez-faire' which for nearly 100 years has
kept the law to a minimum, but which has also encouraged unions and
employers to slug it out at the workplace.
The basis of collective laissez-faire is being eroded by the decline of
trade unions and the creation of new rights for individuals at the
workplace. Contrary to much of the rhetoric at last week's TUC Congress in
Brighton, most non-unionised British workers do not stand unprotected before
the whims of their employers.
But the main problem is that employees' understanding of their rights and
their enforcement through the courts or industrial tribunals is increasingly
defective. The Engineering Employers Federation argues that because of the
way statutory provisions are drafted and amended, and because of the
accumulation of case law, the understanding of subjects like maternity
rights or redundancies has become increasingly problematic. At the same
time, the industrial tribunals themselves have become bogged down in
legalism, causing delays and uncertainty.
The answer the EEF proposes is regularly updated codes of practice on
employment law which would have greater authority than case law and would
help unblock tribunals. One way forward would be for the government to
conceive a form of Citizen's Charter for the workplace, setting out employee
rights, to be attached to each employment contract. It could be supplemented
by a voluntary code of practice, on matters such as employee consultation
which are not covered by the law.
A more contentious notion would be to convert existing collective immunities
into individual rights, although that would raise the difficult issue of a
right to strike, or perhaps more precisely a right not to be dismissed for
striking for a certain period of time. To balance any such right, the
government could restrict strikes in essential services and give employers
greater flexibility in changing employment conditions without being subject
to unfair dismissal proceedings.
The EEF paper stops short of considering these complications. But it is a
worthwhile contribution to which ministers should give serious attention.

Sir, Your survey of Northern Ireland (September 9) was both interesting and
informative. One cannot but think that if a political solution to the
problems besetting the country could be found, great improvements would be
made.
At a time when both South Africa and Israel have thought the unthinkable and
negotiated with their enemies and brought political solutions in sight,
should not our government similarly buckle down to finding a political
solution in Northern Ireland?
Perhaps the foreign secretary could devote more of his efforts to this very
worthwhile end. If this government could come to some sort of an arrangement
in Northern Ireland, I am sure it would reap huge political gains and might
even go some way towards solving its long-term financial problems.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ecuador's reforestation project still
commands strong support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK CONSTANTINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'When conservation efforts fail to protect' (September
1), does a good job of describing the rapid destruction of the tropical rain
forest of Ecuador, but fails to do justice to what could be a model
reforestation project - Ecoforest 2000.
There are two factual discrepancies in the article. First, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) has not withdrawn from the project. Rather, IFC
will not finance the project until it has attained assurances that the
environmental and social issues that have been raised are addressed. Second,
the project has not collapsed. The Durini Group (the company) is continuing
to establish plantations to reduce its dependency on primary forest wood
sources, although without external financing, progress will proceed at a
much slower pace.
At a public forum held in Quito in April 1993, results of an independent
review of the biodiversity and social impact aspects of the project were
presented. The meeting provided an opportunity for a broad spectrum of local
and international non-governmental organisations and representatives of the
affected indige nous and ethnic minority communities to present their views
on the project. Subsequent correspondence from the participants and other
interested parties, with few exceptions, has been supportive to the project,
assuming implementation of the recommendations of the independent review.
IFC remains convinced of the merits of the project. Ecoforest 2000 will
result in the reforestation of 5,000 hectares of degraded land, provide a
long-term sustainable supply of wood, and eventually eliminate the company's
logging in primary tropical rainforest.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sanctions no answer to halting the
decline in rhino population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER BATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The sanctions ('US to impose sanctions on China and Taiwan over rhino
horn trade', September 8), if forthcoming, will undoubtedly reduce the
volume of rhino horn reaching China and Taiwan. However, they are also
likely to result in a further decline in rhino populations.
The price of rhino horn will rise, on an increasingly clandestine market,
thereby encouraging further poaching activities. The horn is prized in Asia
as a fever remedy. However, the lack of a legal market (or an illegal outlet
in Asia) renders a lucrative commodity worthless to the local people of
Zimbabwe, Sumatra etc. Therefore they have little incentive to protect their
rhino.
If, on the other hand, local people were allowed to own and trade in rhino
horn (at prices up to Dollars 60,000 a kilo) it would provide a powerful
incentive for them to protect their rhinos. For example, white rhino horn
can effectually be harvested without killing the rhino. This would have two
effects: first, it would increase the rhino farmers' incentive to protect
the rhino; second, a rhino without a horn is less attractive to a poacher.
The motive of the US Environmental Investigation Agency is laudable in
wanting to maintain the world's rhino population. However, attempting to
reduce the supply of horn will not reduce the demand for it, and will merely
increase the likelihood of a faster extinction rate for the rhino.
Allowing trade in rhino horn may offend many people, but it would ensure
that a sizeable population of rhinos remains, which is, I presume, the aim.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Probe into truth's darker corners: Whitehall's workings are
receiving their severest scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, if ever, is it justifiable for ministers and civil servants to lie 'in
the public interest'? That thorny question is at the heart of an inquiry,
which resumes today, into UK sales of arms to Iraq.
Never before have the workings of Whitehall been subjected to such detailed
scrutiny - nor senior civil servants so discomfited by the glare of
publicity.
The inquiry, headed by Lord Justice Scott, was launched last November by
John Major, the prime minister, after it was disclosed that the government
had tried to withhold vital evidence from the trial last year of three
executives of Matrix Churchill, a Midlands-based machine tools company. The
findings will be published around mid-1994.
Lord Justice Scott, who unlike civil service officials agreed to be
interviewed 'on the record', says that when he first started the inquiry it
was like 'looking into a very murky and inaccurate crystal ball'. While some
civil servants accept that it occasionally makes sense to be 'economical
with the truth', in the phrase of Lord Armstrong, the former civil service
head, they also recognise how difficult it is to convince the public that
this is justifiable.
One senior official said: 'Scott does not seem to understand what I would
call a principle of government . . . This is that you don't tell a lie, but
you don't have to open up completely . . . There have been occasions when
ministers have felt honestly that it is wrong to open up the 'dossier'.'
Another civil servant, who has appeared as a witness before the inquiry,
said of the cross-examination he had received: 'It was a most uncomfortable
experience, a clear clash of cultures . . . We are not used to having to
answer for our actions in public, but the judge seems unable to understand
the political, diplomatic and commercial realities existing in the 1980s.'
Lord Justice Scott is making life equally uncomfortable for past and present
ministers. He has asked Sir Patrick Mayhew, the former attorney-general and
current Northern Ireland secretary, whether he was part of an alleged
cover-up to prevent evidence coming to court about UK involvement in the
building of an Iraqi Supergun. In coming weeks, Scott is scheduled to
interrogate Lady Thatcher and Mr Major on what they knew of UK sales of arms
to Iraq in the 1980s.
In the trial of the Matrix Churchill executives, the defendants might have
been convicted of illegally supplying arms to Iraq without the evidence the
government tried to withhold. The prosecution abandoned the case, however,
after the judge refused the government's request to withhold classified
documents in the public interest.
These documents disclosed that the departments of trade and industry,
defence and the Foreign Office had known about Matrix Churchill's business
with Iraq in the mid-1980s, in apparent contravention of stated government
policy that the UK would not export equipment that 'would significantly
enhance' the conflict at that time between Iran and Iraq.
The Matrix-Churchill prosecutions have become an important part of Lord
Justice Scott's inquiry, which is being conducted in the Department of
Energy's former headquarters in Buckingham Gate, central London.
Since the public hearings began in May, the Scott team has grilled 23
Whitehall officials and ministers. It has also pressed government
departments into providing thousands of documents, some classified, and
taken behind-doors testimony from senior intelligence officers.
In theory, Lord Justice Scott's powers are limited. He cannot compel
witnesses to appear. Although the government has promised to give full
co-operation, at least one potentially crucial witness, Mr Alan Clarke,
former defence minister, has said he might not give evidence.
The inquiry is now focusing on questions such as:
Did the government deliberately lie to parliament by saying that there was
an embargo on the sale of lethal arms to Iraq while secretly encouraging
such sales from the mid-1980s until shortly before the invasion of Kuwait in
1990?
Who among ministers and Whitehall officials was responsible for the alleged
deception?
If the government did lie to Parliament, was that justified? On the other
hand, was the alleged misleading of Parliament the consequence of a culture
of dishonesty within the highest reaches of Whitehall?
Not since 1983, when senior diplomat Lord Franks probed the UK's handling of
the Falklands crisis, has the machinery of government and the process of
formulating foreign and defence policy been examined so publicly.
Franks's report largely exonerated the government of any direct blame.
Senior officials fear the outcome of the Scott inquiry could be more
far-reaching. One senior civil servant commented: 'There has been an attempt
to pass it (the handling of Iraqi policy) off as a 'cock-up', but I'm
dubious about this . . . It does seem to me that we were keen to sell arms
to Iraq and there was a certain amount of bending of the rules.'
Officials' nervousness has been caused partly by the negative view some have
of Lord Justice Scott. While Lord Franks was regarded as an insider, Lord
Justice Scott has a reputation as a liberal judge and is not so obviously
clubbable. In 1987 he refused to grant government injunctions banning
newspapers from publishing extracts of a book by the former intelligence
officer, Mr Peter Wright.
He has said he believes government is often surrounded by an unjustified
veil of secrecy. 'I think the government should be prepared to share with
the public, on whose behalf it governs, its concerns and aims and the
reasons why important decisions are taken.'
But some fear that his findings will not be understood by the public. One
official, a former permanent undersecretary of state at the Ministry of
Defence, said: 'An inquiry by a High Court judge is not the best way of
doing this . . . He may bring out the facts but my doubt is whether he
really understands about the day-to-day business of government where things,
if not quite murky, are not clear cut.'
While Lord Justice Scott refuses to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry,
observers like Alex Danchev, professor of international relations at Keele
University, who wrote an analysis of the Franks report, claim the
cross-examination of witnesses in public is proving a healthy corrective of
what he believes is the abuse of power. 'Civil servants after Scott are
going to find it much more difficult to behave simply like handmaidens of
government.'
His view finds support from a senior Foreign Office official, who has
appeared before the inquiry. He said: 'I think what Scott is pointing out is
a Whitehall culture which, because of its inherent secrecy, is prone to make
mistakes . . . We have tended to confuse service to ministers with the
national interest. I would welcome a new code of conduct.'
Whitehall could become more open and accountable after the inquiry. But
whether there will be disclosures in coming months that could lead to the
resignation of ministers and officials is uncertain.
A defence minister said he had scrutinised all the government documents made
available to Scott, and had found nothing to suggest a sinister
Machiavellian conspiracy.
Scott himself has said that expectations about the outcome of the inquiry
should not be exaggerated: 'I do not see myself as holding a gun at the
heart of government.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Independent bank is right for
democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLAN LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In reading Mr Gerald Holtham's article, 'No case for independent
central bank' (September 3), I could not help but ask myself some elementary
questions about fiscal versus monetary policy.
Specifically, how democratically responsible would it be for a new
government to reverse all of the fiscal policies of a prior government,
without a check on the monetary side of the equation?
If there existed a constitutional guarantee that all elected representatives
would pursue anti-inflationary policies, then a non-independent central bank
would be tenable. Otherwise, a government which controls both fiscal and
monetary levers will always be susceptible to mismanagement.
The economic performance of a country is too important to be completely
manipulated by the government of the day.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANCOIS ELDIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You quote the chairman of British Airways ('BA presses for curb on
European subsidies', September 10) as saying that 'some Dollars 3bn have
been pumped into three European airlines in the last three years' and,
further on, Paul Betts writes that these Dollars 3bn are 'state support to
Air France, Sabena and Iberia'.
This is not true. Air France has not received any 'state aid' in the past
years. In 1991 we launched a FFr2bn rights issue and the French state, our
main shareholder, subscribed as any private shareholder would have done to
help finance major investment.
The European Commission screened this rights issue and publicly concluded,
in July 1992, that it was not state aid.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Personal View: Age of the risk taker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY KAUFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What develop-ments might have the biggest potential impact on financial
markets? Experts typically cite innovations such as exotic derivative
in-struments or asset securitisation or greatly expanded international
trading activity. But in the US at least, arguably the most significant
development is the enlarged role of the household sector as a financial risk
taker.
Millions of people have branched out from passively holding bank deposits
and indirectly owning securities through such intermediaries as pension
funds to becoming direct participants in financial markets - and thus are
exposed to risks beyond those they are accustomed to.
In 1978, American individuals, farmers and small businesses held about 40
per cent of their total assets in deposit form. By the first quarter of
1993, the share of deposits and money funds with no capital risk had
dwindled to 24 per cent of total financial assets. In 1978 Americans held
only about a third of their total financial assets in instruments directly
carrying market risk: 19 per cent in common stock, 7 per cent in bonds and 6
per cent in miscellaneous assets. Only 1.2 per cent was invested in mutual
funds of any kind. Today, assets directly carrying capital risk account for
almost 40 per cent of total financial assets. Of that, 16 per cent is in
common stocks, 9 per cent in bonds and 7 per cent in miscellaneous assets.
Equity and bond mutual funds have surged to 7 per cent.
Mutual funds continue to mushroom - up by an estimated Dollars 22bn (Pounds
14.6bn) a month so far this year, a third higher than last year's monthly
average and four times the Dollars 5bn monthly average posted as recently as
1990. Mutual funds represent the largest institutional buyer of American
equities and of tax-exempt municipal bonds, and they rank high as buyers of
taxable bonds.
The other significant shift in household portfolios has been the steady
expansion of retirement funds. Back in 1978, a fifth of household total
assets was invested through pension plans, mostly defined benefit plans for
which the sponsoring employer bore the ultimate capital risk on investments.
At present, pension fund reserves have risen to about a third of total
household financial assets. But an increasing share of those funds
represents defined contribution plans, where the worker bears the capital
risk on the investments not the employer. Defined benefit retirement plans,
which tend to be sponsored by the same large corporations now engaged in
restructuring, are shrinking. Over time, a shift toward defined contribution
pension plans will leave affected retirees with greater financial
uncertainty. Retirement income will depend not only on the type of
investments in the plan but also on market conditions when retirement takes
place, a significant risk to the retiree.
What are the ramifications of these changes? First, the shift away from
deposits, like the shift away from defined benefit retirement plans, is a
transfer from obligations assuring the nominal capital value of the assets
to those whose future values are unknown.
Mutual funds are see-through institutions, taking no risks of their own.
Risk and reward are passed on to fund holders. Banks, in contrast, provide
stated returns and interpose their own capital to take additional risks. But
mutual fund investors may not appreciate all the risks they are taking on.
They may act quite unpredictably if a sudden market upheaval dramatically
reveals the true risk.
Second, a large increase in money rates will surely induce significant
shifts back into deposits and money market funds. This may provoke far
greater and quicker declines in the value of equities and of bonds than in
prior decades, when longer maturity obligations were largely in
institutional portfolios. The economic impact should also be quite abrupt.
In this new financial world, changes in stock and bond prices will have a
more noticeable wealth effect on individuals. Consequently, personal
consumption, which cyclically tends to be more stable than other components
of economic activity, will take on much more of a cyclical hue.
For central banks, all this will pose unfamiliar challenges. A sharp shift
by households out of mutual funds into deposits and money market funds will
hurt bond and stock markets, but will increase the growth of money. Will
this be interpreted as a symptom of future economic growth or a precursor of
contraction?
Indeed, the greater volatility coming from these structural changes may well
induce public pressures for greater official intervention in the financial
markets. Whipsawed by greater swings in their financial wealth, investors
may demand that the government find a way to intervene in segments of the
financial markets heretofore considered off-limits for 'open market
operations', notably the equity market.
This is not going to happen today or tomorrow, but if reports from Tokyo
earlier this year are right, the Japanese government purportedly persuaded
state pension funds to step into the Japanese equity market to give stock
prices a lift. Who is to say that a similar form of intervention could not
be devised in, say, the US or UK?
Lately, we have seen the pleasant side of volatility, rising stocks and bond
prices with just occasional interruptions. But the dark side of volatility
is bound to come again. When it does we may get the answer to what will be
the central question - whether economic growth is sustainable if the
financial markets are challenged by a rise in interest rates and households
are threatened more directly than in the past by a decline in the value of
their financial assets.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Beethoven rolls over for King's - Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tradition whereby the penultimate night of the Proms was given over to
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony seems well and truly broken. It has to be right
that other composers occupy this prestigious date and the choice fell this
year on two of England's finest, Byrd and Purcell.
It also - surprisingly - marked the first ever appearance at the Proms by
the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. One venerable English institution
meets another, the choir being the more venerable by some centuries as it
dates back to the time of Henry VI. (Interesting to note that the
residential choir school at King's and the Royal Albert Hall both date from
the 1870s, when the Victorian patronage of music was at its height.)
There is a point to this historical background. For decades after the war,
and even longer before, it was the cathedral and college choirs of Britain
that kept the flame burning for the sacred music of composers like Byrd and
Purcell. But no more: small, fully professional choirs, such as the Tallis
Scholars and the Sixteen, have risen to dominance in this repertoire,
particularly in recordings.
To hear the King's choir again at Friday's Prom in a selection of Byrd's
early Latin pieces came as quite a surprise, not necessarily an unpleasant
one. The traditional college sound (sweet treble tone, youthful light
basses) is not as focused or concentrated as the professional groups, but it
has a natural feel to it. Byrd is hardly likely to have heard his music sung
by bands of hand-picked, well-drilled, potential soloists.
Under the direction of Stephen Cleobury, its director of music, the choir
gave mostly tidy and sensitive performances of the Byrd and Purcell's Come,
ye sons of art. The King's style has never involved much digging for
expression and its Purcell was on the wan side, light, stylish, agreeable on
the surface, but needing a bit more straightforward punch. Of the soloists,
Stephen Varcoe bit into his words with most determination.
In between, London Baroque under Charles Medlam played Handel's Concerto
Grosso Op. 6 No. 6 and accompanied the soprano Lynne Dawson in his motet
Silete venti - well contrasted pieces, which gave a relatively long
programme plenty of variety. Beethoven was not missed.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business of archiving opera has hardly begun in earnest. At a time when
productions are expected to be up-to-the-minute in novelty and relevance, it
is unfashionable to point out that there is also a case for preserving those
thought to have historic value - the Royal Opera's Tosca and Don Carlos come
to mind.
Perhaps a start is being made. To open the new season, the Royal Opera is
bringing back its old production of Madama Butterfly. No reason has been
given. It may be that its intrinsic quality makes it a special case. More
likely, its replacement was deemed unworthy of further revival. Either way
Sophie Fedorovitch's sets from 1950 had fortunately been kept in a warehouse
and now look fresh and nicely stylised.
After a production which had Butterfly living in a squalid, modern tenement
block, they make one realise how important the right time and place are in
this opera. The social background of turn-of-the-century Japan is essential
if Butterfly is to be an outcast, left to live and die alone. The very
privacy of her feelings is what the character is about and it is an irony
that Puccini's music should come from the most outgoing, emotive operatic
style of all: therein lies the opera's great emotional tension.
At least, in a good performance it should feel like that. This one, though
better technically than the Royal Opera's previous revivals, was unmoving.
After some of the Puccini conducting heard at Covent Garden of late, Carlo
Rizzi's generally idiomatic feel for the score was a step in the right
direction. He likes a firm and concentrated Puccini sound and the orchestra
played well for him.
Diana Soviero is an American soprano with an Italian-sounding name and
voice, like Anna Moffo before her or Catherine Malfitano (also a Royal Opera
Butterfly) today. The number of times she took breaths to prepare for a top
note suggests some degree of strain in tackling the role; otherwise she has
sufficient power for it, a cutting edge to the tone, the ability to make the
words tell. But I was always aware of a singer and actress at work. Her
predecessor here, Yoko Watanabe, was natural and infinitely more touching.
Arthur Davies was again Pinkerton, singing a little more freely than before,
though he continues to look uneasy in the role. Alan Opie joined him as a
mellow, thoughtful Sharpless, both of them sounding overparted in the first
act (their roles were taken by Zenatello and De Luca at the premiere, rather
more forceful Italianate voices). Anne-Marie Owens's Suzuki alone is all
heart, losing none of her warmth in the transfer from English National
Opera.
To come out of Madama Butterfly and not even to have thought of shedding a
tear is a bad sign. The staging by Richard Gregson is said to be new, but it
keeps to the obvious until the end, when Butterfly flings her screen aside
and writhes around in agony on the floor for all to see, providing a final
shock-horror tableau. If there was an archive film from 1950, it would
surely have preserved something more affecting.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Lit from within by Tortelier - Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Proms last week, the BBC Philharmonic's programme might have been
designed to show off its newly dazzling prowess - and why not? From 1934, it
used to be the 'BBC Northern Symphony' (though the Proms programme-book
preferred not to mention that: too reminiscent, no doubt, of routine Radio 3
broadcasts at unfavoured hours). More recently, up to last summer, Sir
Edward Downes - a great orchestral trainer - re-made the band entirely; and
on Thursday, Yan Pascal Tortelier found himself conducting a brilliantly
capable orchestra.
Tortelier's father was the great French cellist, Paul. Among conductors in
Britain today, only Yan Pascal (and on good nights, the American Andrew
Litton) can boast so stylish a command of the 'impressionist' repertoire.
That label is a loose one, covering disparate post-Saint-Saens endeavours -
but distinctively French - from old Faure (a Saint-Saens pupil) through
Debussy, Ravel and Roussel to 'Les Six', Poulenc among them, and even to
Dutilleux.
Tortelier has the clue to all that: light-handed poise, precision in rhythms
and colours, transparency, a minimum of 'expressive' rubato. In Debussy's
Iberia those virtues triumphed, in a performance where scrupulous
preparation was no less evident than the individual subtleties of the BBC
Philharmonic's strong team. Tortelier made his effects, or rather Debussy's,
with super-honed tact and grace; they arrived naturally, but always with
ping. The music seemed lit from within; one heard some of the inner-voice
parts and punctuations as if for the first time.
That was intermittently true of Ravel's two-hand piano concerto too. If not
every sly joke came off, more than enough of them did (well beyond par for
this tricky score). The orchestra fairly sizzled, and the soloist
Jean-Bernard Pommier tried out any number of pithy, personal ideas. In both
those works, however, I kept missing the first violins.
From the FT's regular Albert Hall seats, and probably from any seats in
Stalls Left since the echo-killing 'acoustic mushrooms' on the ceiling were
trimmed back last summer, what one sees of the violins is chiefly their
right shoulder-blades - and what one hears of them, turned almost 90 degrees
away, is faint and elusive.
In Lutoslawski's flashy, exhilarating Concerto for Orchestra (1954: the
composer has no great opinion of it now), the only fault to find with this
Prom performance was that the high strings' silken passages - from where I
sat - carried so little weight amid the wind onslaughts.
That left the music with a hard, brassy edge, rawly exciting (it got a
fervent reception) but chilly nonetheless. As for Leo Brouwer's
guitar-and-orchestra arrangements for Julian Bream, of three numbers from
Albeniz's wildly pianistic Iberia Suites, I wished I had heard them on Radio
3 at home. The piano originals are chock-a-block with notes; Brouwer's
orchestral translations are apt and sympathetic in principle, but in the
Albert Hall they swamped Bream's guitar again and again. They should work
far better on CDs.

With the autumn season, Monday evenings are once again becoming heavy on the
factual side. Prompted by the visit to Britain of Australian prime minister
Paul Keating, BBC2's Assignment (7.40) considers plans to turn Australia
into a republic, and interviews Keating's political rival, Bob Hawke.
Channel 4 continues its series Vets In The Wild which has an underlying
sadness: Barkley Hastings, who is seen training young vets at Whipsnade Zoo,
died last year of cancer, aged 34, before his pupils could start work
(9.00).
Panorama investigates 'Babies On Benefit': Rachel who became pregnant at 15
in order to leave school and get her own home; Michelle who, at 22, is
expecting the fifth of the babies she has had by two different fathers, and
so on (9.30).
The Late Show returns to BBC2 with former television critic Mark Lawson
added to the familiar team of presenters. Let's hope he ignores the Guardian
party line and brings a trace of non-conformism to the only regular current
affairs series on television dealing with the arts . . . and, ominously,
'kulcher' (11.15).

FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: A slice of Saturday night - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Slice of Saturday Night by the Heather Brothers has joined the long list
of musical shows now running in London's West End and may well stay for some
time. The best non-sung line comes at the end when Dennis Waterman, playing
the ageing club-owner, bouncer and performer, Eric 'Rubber Legs' De Vene,
says of his establishment: 'It's one of life's big finishing schools.'
Certainly that's the way it seems. People in the 1990s look back at the
1960s just as people who grew up in the 1950s looked back at the 1920s:
nostalgia for a romanticised age. Slice does not quite repeat the old songs.
It consists of a series of derivatives, some of them mildly satirical. It
also has just the touch of a clever plot: an
unattractive youth, played with the utmost professionalism by Peter
Heppelthwaite, wagers that he can make Frigid Bridget (Judith Ellis) before
the night is out. He doesn't.
The young pop star, Sonia, sings and plays the 17-year-old Sue with huge
assurance. On the first night an audience of all ages was delighted,
especially in the second act. It is during the interval that the show takes
off.
The Heather Brothers already have Lust, the musical of The Country Wife,
running at the Haymarket. Tomorrow comes the revival of one of the biggest
1960s musicals of all: Hair at the Old Vic.

I sense a new harmony in the air. Peace accords between formerly
intransigent enemies in the Middle East bring an important sense of hope
into the world. Will this optimism bring about a sense of rejuvenation
instead of conflict in the world at large? Governments are speaking much
more of collaboration between sectors of society rather than confrontation.
Only last week the British government talked of restructuring the urban
programme with one co-ordinator, in the shape of Mr John Wakeham, to unite
and rationalise all the urban inner city initiatives which have recently
flowered in a glorious garden of incoherence. The reconstruction of the
cities of Britain needs not just a solid alliance between the public and the
private sectors but also a sense of unified direction that is clearly
missing at the moment.
It is hard to get the measure of the assured Mr Selwyn Gummer at the
Department of the Environment - I detect that he has a high level of concern
for his surroundings, not least because he lives in a house designed by S.
S. Teulon, one of the most sophisticated and difficult Victorian architects.
I wonder whether he will be able to withstand the biased blandishments of
the architectural establishment or will he listen to the architects'
customers and consumers?
The need in Britain now is not for another development boom that will again
take scant regard of the needs of the community, but for a measured and
harmonious approach to planning and development in response to some
long-term goals.
In the interests of bridge building and harmony and the encouragement of the
architectural debate it is worth examining one of the government's more
dubious ways of encouraging good architecture through the Arts Council's
Pounds 200,000 grant programme.
More than a quarter of this money this year has been awarded to one London
body, The Architecture Foundation, which is really a centre for fairly
arcane exhibitions. A great many of the smaller grants go to the predictable
crop of old fashioned Modernist promoters.
An example of the wisdom of the Arts Council is the decision to give a
modest Pounds 1,500 to workshops on the Italian Renaissance and Pounds 5,000
for an exhibition about post-war British architecture.
There is practically nothing for architectural history of any serious kind,
nothing to help the development industry encourage better design in private
housing, but there is the inevitably politically correct donation to the
Women in Construction Alliance.
There is an obsessive belief in the minds of art bureaucrats that if there
is a hint of public interest in a subject then you must set up a 'centre'
for it. English Estates has been prevailed upon to give Pounds 30,000
towards studies for the establishment of nine architecture centres
throughout England.
It is staggering that no grants are given to television, radio, video or
other contemporary media that could spread the word about architecture
without the need for offices, personnel, endless committees and the
inbreeding of art bureaucrats that architecture 'centres' will inevitably
cause.
The pointlessness of so much that this architecture unit has so far achieved
seems to make it an ideal candidate for Mr Portillo's public spending
cutting knife. It will be no loss.
* I was fascinated to read that, 'the majority of people in Britain know
next to nothing about architecture' and only 13 per cent of the 1,000 people
questioned by Gallup for the Riba Journal, could name three architects. Sir
Christopher Wren was recognised as an architect by 32 per cent of the
respondents.
This poll asked loaded questions to encourage the continuing protection of
the architect's title. How would you answer the question, 'Do you think that
anyone should be able to call themselves an architect, regardless of
qualification?' Of course you would answer 'No'. But the deregistration of
architects currently under consideration does not suggest that anyone can
practice 'regardless of qualification'. If you ask the right questions you
get the answers you want.
* I am looking forward to the exhibition of the work of that neglected
genius of British architecture - Beresford Pite (1861-1934) which opens on
16 September at the Riba Heinz Gallery, 21 Portman Square, London W1, until
23 October.
He was a bridge builder in the sense that his brilliant and more or less
unknown buildings attempted to fuse the virtues of Classical and Gothic
design in the modern city. He also had a vision of the city and of the need
for wholeness and harmony in architecture. His ideas make a great deal of
sense today at a time when the architectural establishment seems to find it
impossible to believe (in spite of Gallup polls) that the public wants
inspiration and harmony - not endless repetitions of fashionable and
irrelevant nostrums.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: . . . but Cadbury leaves a bitter taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the corporate governance bandwagon is gaining momentum worldwide,
signs of resistance are emerging in Britain.
The problem is not apparent from the numbers. A survey updated last week by
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed that of the 87 FT-SE 100 companies
producing annual reports for financial years between December 1992 and April
1993, a record 90 per cent now make disclosures on the subject.
More than 72 per cent also provide some sort of statement of compliance with
the code of conduct launched last December by the Cadbury committee on the
financial aspects of corporate governance. This is during the period before
a statement of compliance became mandatory for quoted companies - for
year-ends after last June.
But a number of the reports express misgivings. Commercial Union warns that
implementing some aspects of Cadbury's recommendations 'may lead to
excessively elaborate procedures and disappointed expectations'.
'Most of the advice has been long on accountability and short on encouraging
efficiency and enterprise,' writes Lord Hanson dismissively in his
chairman's statement. BTR reports: 'The introduction of a code, however
well-intentioned, cannot ensure integrity or competence.'
There are greater concerns among smaller quoted companies, many of which
complain the code is too costly or irrelevant for their operations.
'The majority of companies want to be seen to be endorsing Cadbury
whole-heartedly,' says David Pimm, director of Coopers' corporate governance
support unit. But he adds that many have had difficulties interpreting the
code's guidance on how to define 'independent' non-executives, for instance.
Some are also concerned about elements of the code, such as the danger that
the provision for non-executives to take independent professional advice may
represent 'a blank cheque'.
Most important, under pressure from industry, guidelines have been delayed
on reporting two of the most vital elements of the code - the statement on
internal controls and on whether the company is a 'going concern'. There
have been more than 17 drafts of the first of these and they are unlikely to
be issued until early next year.
The London Stock Exchange - which can threaten to de-list companies failing
to provide a statement of compliance with the code - has reassured company
directors that they will not have to comply with these aspects until the
guidelines are released.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: When commitment heads the agenda - Tips From The
Top / In a new series, Sir Richard Greenbury of Marks and Spencer offers
advice on conducting a board meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir RICHARD GREENBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important factor governing a successful board meeting is the
quality of the board itself. If the members of the board are all people with
a strong commitment to the company - and a real knowledge and experience of
its operations - then constructive discussion will be possible and sound
decisions can be reached.
The balance of the board is also crucial and requires the right number of
'heavyweight' non-executive directors to bring an independent viewpoint,
experienced judgment and knowledge not available within the company. They
must have a range of skills complementary to the expertise of those who have
made their careers within the business.
Board meetings must be well-organised, held at regular points in the
calendar, and the dates agreed formally at least six months ahead so that no
one misses a meeting other than for exceptional reasons. Board meetings can
take a long time, so air-conditioned boardrooms, comfortable seating
arrangements and modern presentation systems are also important.
There should be a clear agenda determined by the chairman; all relevant
papers should be circulated in good time so that everyone comes to the
meeting fully prepared. Indeed members of the board submitting proposals for
discussion as formal papers should sound out their colleagues privately
beforehand, thoroughly explaining their ideas.
Board meetings must not be solemn affairs, although they should always be
businesslike. There is a place for humour in the boardroom which helps one
and all to keep a sense of proportion. Everyone should respect the authority
of the chairman, but there is no need for every remark to be addressed
'through the chair' which tends to stifle discussion.
The most fundamental requirement of a good board meeting is that everyone be
encouraged to participate and allowed to express his or her views frankly
and openly. In arriving at clear, agreed policy decisions the discussion
must be completely free; indeed the more controversial the better, provided
it is within the bounds of courtesy.
If debate is lengthy the chairman should sum up the main arguments before
requesting a decision. Should a vote be necessary, which hopefully is a last
resort, the chairman should be the last one to declare his position.
Once a formal decision is reached, directors are bound by law to abide by
it. But it is equally important that they also give full and whole-hearted
support. Minority views must be forgotten and for this reason particularly
every member of the board needs to voice his or her opinion during the
meeting, particularly if it is contentious.
Board meetings should be confined as far as possible to taking strategic and
policy decisions. Short separate weekly meetings of executive directors can
deal with all sorts of matters which otherwise would tend to clog up the
board meetings. These would include the current progress of the business,
any topical issues and the day-to-day running of the company.
Much can be done between board meetings by sub-committees of board members,
supplemented by the relevant experts (for example, for capital expenditure,
information technology and personnel). These sub-committees should be given
the authority to act within strict terms of reference, reporting the action
they have taken or requesting approval for significant decisions.
There is no absolute magic formula. Every company has its own culture and
metabolism, and different types of business require separate types of
management style and approach from the board. Nevertheless all board
meetings have the same objectives and responsibilities towards shareholders,
staff and customers, and therefore must be conducted with total integrity as
well as efficiency.
Next Monday: Sipko Huismans of Courtaulds on how to make an after-dinner
speech.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: Governance goes global - The spread of
shareholder activism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the annals of business history, 1993 may go down as the year that
shareholder activism went global.
Over the past few months, at annual meetings around the globe, boards of
directors have found themselves facing shareholders who take an active
interest in the performance and management of the business - and are willing
to cast votes against executive resolutions with which they disagree.
This so-called 'corporate governance' movement began in the US about a
decade ago and has also become well established in the UK. But it has only
begun to put down strong roots in continental Europe and Japan in the past
couple of years.
A significant landmark came last December at the annual meeting of the
German energy conglomerate RWE, when a German shareholder association's
resolution for a one-share, one-vote ballot system was strongly supported by
the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the most
forceful leaders of the US corporate governance movement.
A new report from the Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services,
an independent group which advises large investors on corporate governance
issues, says the RWE case is a prime example of an important emerging trend
in shareholder voting patterns.
Indigenous shareholder groups are growing up in many countries - ranging
from relatively new ones in Australia and Japan to more established European
groups - and these are being supported in 'proxy' (shareholder voting)
matters by increasingly active (and largely US-based) global institutions.
'These groups are beginning to find common ground on a wide range of
corporate governance issues, and their efforts have brought these issues to
the top of many an agenda,' says ISS.
The report is an example of the increasing sophistication of international
shareholder voting. It is the first of a regular quarterly series in which
ISS will review proxy voting trends around the globe, country by country.
This report covers the April to June quarter - the peak season for annual
meetings around the globe - and says the most spectacular international
corporate governance event was probably the successful fight by investors in
the UK and US to prevent Britain's Hanson group restricting shareholders'
ability to nominate directors and amend corporate resolutions.
Other examples of international action during the period include: protests
by the pension fund for local employees of Caterpillar, the US heavy
equipment company about dividend policies at the shareholder meeting of
Nestle, the Swiss foods group; and the defeat of a proposal giving the board
blanket authorisation to issue capital at the Dutch chemicals group Akzo.
The survey notes that a significant factor in the rise of the global
movement has been the greater efficiency of global custodian banks, whose
local affiliates are the holders of records for clients' shares. They have
been putting more effort into obtaining proxy voting materials and
English-language meeting agendas, and then taking responsibility for
executing votes according to investors' wishes.
However, the report also points to a problem facing investors in Japan,
where 90 per cent of listed companies hold their annual meetings on the same
day in late June.
This year an unprecedented number of foreign institutions tried to cast
votes on this day, yet many of the negative votes cast were never tallied at
the meetings. Institutions whose votes were 'lost' include Calpers, which is
looking for answers.
ISS says this strengthens the view of many foreign institutions that their
votes are not being handled properly in Japan. 'This is most likely true,'
it adds, 'but as much for reasons of unfamiliarity on the part of Japanese
banks as outright sabotage.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Economics: UK braced for inflation indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK brings a string of UK economic figures covering inflation,
unemployment and manufacturing output.
With many economists predicting that inflation has hit bottom, the retail
prices index on Wednesday will be of particular interest.
A commonly-held view among London-based analysts is that the headline rate
reached a trough in June, when the inflation rose just 1.2 per cent
year-on-year. In July it notched up to 1.4 per cent and the median forecast
for August is 1.5 per cent.
The more important underlying rate, excluding mortgage interest payments and
which the Treasury aims to hold within a target range of 1 per cent to 4 per
cent, is forecast to remain unchanged at 2.9 per cent.
Other inflationary indicators include the producer prices index today and
average earnings figures on Thursday, which are published with unemployment
figures on Thursday.
There are fewer figures of note in continental Europe although second
quarter GDP figures for France, released on Friday, are expected to confirm
that the French economy contracted, if marginally.
Germany sees little action this week following the Bundesbank's move to
lower key rates last Thursday.
In the US the markets will spotlight August consumer prices, retail sales
and industrial production.
The most important economic statistics and events of the week follow. The
figures in brackets are from MMS International, the financial information
company.

FT  13 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY effects should help Inchcape, the international services and
marketing group, to report today a rise in half-year pre-tax profits from
Pounds 117m to more than Pounds 140m. The recovery in UK car sales will be
balanced by the downturn in the continental European market.
Continuing growth in Hong Kong will also mask more difficult trading
conditions in Japan, but the group will be quizzed closely over the future
of China's experiment in rapid economic development.
British Aerospace is expected to return to the black when it reports interim
results on Wednesday. Analysts expect it to show a small pre-tax profit -
between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m - against an interim loss of Pounds 129m
last time. The figures will confirm the company's gradual turnround,
although core military profits are likely to show a decline. Losses in the
civil aircraft side of the business will be covered by the hefty provisions
made last year.
Interim pre-tax profits at Kingfisher, the retail group which includes the
Woolworth, Superdrug, Comet and B&amp;Q chains in the UK, and now Darty,
France's largest electrical retailer, are expected to rise from Pounds 64.9m
to between Pounds 72m and Pounds 85m when the figures are announced on
Tuesday. The spread is largely accounted for by different estimates of the
contribution from Darty. Analysts are hoping for good news from the French
business, and about the performance of Depot, the new DIY warehouse chain.
The interim dividend is expected to be lifted from 4.2p to 4.5p.
Monday also sees Dalgety announcing its full-year results. Something between
Pounds 119m and Pounds 123m is expected, though the pre-tax figure will mask
a motley collection of divisional results. Agribusiness and ingredients
should be good, though the consumer goods, snacks and petcare sides will
probably have performed less well in tough and ever more competitive trading
environments. The final dividend is forecast at between 12.3p and 13.65p for
a total between 20.2p and 21.55p, compared with 19.5p last time.
On Thursday, United Biscuits is expected to report only a modest first-half
recovery after the profits collapse inflicted by the US cookie wars a year
ago. Forecasts range from Pounds 70m to Pounds 78m, compared with Pounds 70m
last time. Any improvement by Keebler, the US snacks and biscuits division,
is expected to be offset by margin pressures on McVitie's in the UK and a
flat performance by Smiths, the Australian snacks business acquired last
year.
Also on Thursday, Laporte, the speciality chemicals group which in January
snatched Evode, the chemicals and plastics group from the jaws of Wassall,
is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 46m and
Pounds 49m.
Last time it made Pounds 44.5m. The City will be looking for signs that the
group has put behind it a long period of disappointing earnings growth.
There could also be a rise in the interim dividend from 7p to 7.25p.
On Wednesday Taylor Woodrow is expected to swing back into the black with
interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10.5m compared with a Pounds 16m
loss last year. Last year's loss came after a Pounds 21m provision to cover
falling housing and commercial property prices and prompted the group to cut
its interim dividend to 0.5p - a level which is expected to be maintained.

Sir James Glover, the former commander in chief United Kingdom Land Forces
and a non-executive director of BP, has been appointed chairman designate of
the as yet unnamed company which will be responsible for building and
operating the new Royal Armouries in Leeds.
Christopher O'Boyle (above) is appointed chief executive designate and moves
from the Prudential where he was director of professional technical and
property management services. They are actively seeking funding from the
public and private sectors to enable building work to start soon. The museum
to be built in Leeds will hold and display a large part of the UK's
collection of arms and armour; its present repository, the Tower of London,
has run out of space.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Restoring Welsh landmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A team of divers working in some of the most feared tidal conditions in the
world, at depths of up to 40 ft, are helping to repair the 80-year-old
Mumbles lifeboat station on the Welsh coast.
The five divers are part of a team of concrete experts and technicians from
TARMAC STRUCTURAL REPAIRS, restoring the time-ravaged structure supporting
the lifeboat house, slipway and walkway.
The Pounds 500,000 contract is the seventh to be awarded by the Royal
National Lifeboat Institution to the company for structural repair and
strengthening of some of Britain's most famous lifeboat stations.
The tidal range around the Mumbles headland approaches 10 metres and the
tidal currents generated in the Bristol Channel frequently allows only brief
spells for the divers to work below sea level on the base of the structure,
which was completed in 1914.
Diving and repair crews operate from a barge, which provides a 14-metre long
working platform with 18-metre long jack-up legs embedded into the sea bed.
A mobile crane installed on the barge lifts goods and equipment on to the
working platform.
The divers, working in relays against the clock, use air lines from powerful
suction pumps to remove sand from around the pile supports, which are buried
to a depth of six metres in the sand of the sea bed. Specifically designed
fabric jackets are then placed around the exposed piles and filled using
underwater concrete.

The Royal Mint is increasing its number of non-executive directors from two
to three, all from the private sector. The two new members are Gisela Burg,
managing director of Expotus, an exporter of UK audio industry products, and
Sidney Taylor, TI's director of worldwide manufacturing systems and
technology.
They join Stuart Cameron, an ex-chairman and chief executive of Gallagher,
the tobacco company. His fellow non-executive director, Joe Burnett-Stuart,
formerly with Robert Fleming, has retired.
The Mint, which made an operating profit of Pounds 11.8m in 1992-93, became
an executive agency in April 1990 and is now undergoing a Treasury review of
its status. It says there are 'no current plans' for its privatisation.

FT  13 SEP 93 / People: Carr accelerates to find finance director for Amber
Day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amber Day, the discount retailer which has been racked by boardroom ructions
for the past year, has appointed Keith Paskins, 48, as finance director.
Paskins is well known to Peter Carr, 52, an experienced retailer who took
over as chairman of Amber Day in August. Paskins is a former finance
director of Galerias Preciados, the Spanish stores group where Carr was
chief executive from 1988-91. Before that Paskins worked on financial
systems for the stores group Debenhams, where Carr was managing director.
Carr says the Glasgow-based chain of 52 What Everyone Wants stores would
benefit from Paskins' expertise, but adds: 'It's most important that he's a
retailer first and then he's an accountant. It's rare to find an accountant
with a merchant's attitude.'
Paskins takes the role vacated by David Thompson, who become chief executive
of the company last month after a boardroom tussle which saw the departure
of Stacey Ellis as chairman only seven months after he joined the discount
retailer in an attempt to rebuild its shattered credibility with the City.
Thompson had been acting chief executive since the sudden departure last
year of Philip Green, Amber Day's controversial chairman and chief
executive.

The Ministry of Defence has awarded a Pounds 100m contract to JOHN MOWLEM
CONSTRUCTION for the 'shell and core' construction work at the new
Procurement Executive headquarters at Abbey Wood, north Bristol.
The new headquarters will bring together staff currently housed in nine
different London buildings as well as sites in Bath, Portsdown and Portland.
Annual running cost savings of up to Pounds 40m are estimated along with
manpower savings of a further Pounds 35m a year.
This contract will involve construction of the new headquarters buildings
and is expected to provide a considerable boost for the construction
industry and the local economy. Much of the workforce will be recruited from
the Bristol area and a number of local sub-contractors will also benefit.
Construction work will begin next month and is scheduled for completion in
1996. Interior fit-out work is not included and will be subject to further
competitive tendering. The Procurement Executive will begin to occupy Abbey
Wood from Autumn 1995 as the office accommodation becomes available.
John Laing Construction is currently developing the infrastructure of the
site and the whole scheme is being managed by Symonds Construction
Management.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Automated warehouse in Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
McGregor Cory, the European logistics and distribution specialist, has
awarded TILBURY DOUGLAS CONSTRUCTION an Pounds 11m contract to design and
build an automated warehouse in Barcelona. The multi-client facility is
believed to be the first of its type in Spain, combining a 9,300 sq metres
high-bay store with a 11,300 sq metres conventional low-bay area.
Tilbury Douglas designed the distribution centre around the racking and
mechanical handling systems. The design, supply and installation of the
computerised mechanical handling system are all part of the contract which
is being carried out by Cleco as sub-contractor. Twenty loading docks are
included in the design.
Goods in the main high-bay warehouse will be handled by automated computer
controlled cranes linked to front loading bays. The adjoining low-bay area
will incorporate a controlled temperature area for storing food products.
Office facilities, a fork lift truck maintenance area, and other ancillary
buildings will also be provided.
The warehouse will be completed in September 1994. It will be the first
building in a new business park, whose existence is partly attributable to
the distribution centre.
Tilbury Douglas is working in joint venture with Spanish contractor Jotsa.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Directors attack EC policy on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Directors has launched a fresh attack against EC social
policy, describing it as a 'misdirected and damaging job-destroying
machine'.
In a submission to the European Commission the IoD says that the EC's social
chapter and social action programme are based on 'outdated and undemocratic
collectivist policies geared to the rights of organised labour and driven by
the self-interest of European trade unions'.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, called for EC member countries to be
'set free from the shackles of social policy, which makes the labour market
inflexible and European business uncompetitive'.
Mr Morgan added: 'The biggest problem in Europe today is 17m unemployed. The
focus of future EC social and employment policy must be to get these people
back into work, an objective which will not be achieved by Europe's
anti-employment laws and an even heavier burden of regulation and social
cost on the job creators.'
The IoD's alternative charter concentrates on the rights and
responsibilities of the individual at work, rather than on collective
rights. Its proposals include performance-related pay and employee
involvement.
'The provisions of the charter would be left to national governments or
individual employers and employees to decide, free from Brussels diktat,' Mr
Morgan added.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Booksellers protest over HSE deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKSELLERS have appealed to the government to overturn a decision by the
Health and Safety Executive to sell its publications to a single bookshop
chain - Dillons.
In July the HSE announced that it had awarded the contract for the
distribution of both its free and priced publications to Promotional Logics
(Prolog), which will operate a warehouse and mail-order service, and Dillons
Bookstores, part of the Pentos group.
Mr Terry Collins, group chief executive of Blackwell, the Oxford bookseller,
has written to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, asking him to 'call
in' the HSE decision for review.
At the moment HSE publications are available through Her Majesty's
Stationery Office, its 48 agents, and more than 3,000 bookshops throughout
the country.
From next month, critics say, essential publications such as Health and
Safety at Work regulations will be available in range and quantity only at
22 Dillons stores while a further 80 Dillons and 100 Ryman stores, also part
of Pentos, will act as order points.
In 15 main towns and cities such as Edinburgh, Norwich, Aberystwyth and
Stoke-on-Trent there will be no retail outlet where HSE publications can be
viewed and purchased.
Mr Collins told the employment secretary: 'To restrict availability at the
retail level to any government or government agency publications to a single
source runs contrary to the principles of open government.'
Mr Peter Rimmer, director of information of the HSE, has said the aim of the
new contract is to reduce distribution costs and to improve the marketing
and targeting of HSE publications. HMSO put in a bid for the contract but
was unsuccessful.
Any bookshop can buy the HSE publications at full price but only Prolog and
Dillons can buy at a discount.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Food industry slams Euro rates freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK FOOD industry was up in arms yesterday about a European Commission
decision on Thursday to freeze fluctuations in 'green' currency rates until
the end of September to protect farmers from losses.
The 'green' money rates provide a mechanism for translating EC-guaranteed
farm prices into national currencies.
The UK Food and Drink Federation will send a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, EC
agriculture minister, on Monday complaining strongly about 'the sudden and
arbitrary decision'.
Mr John Bradbury, group buying director for United Biscuits, said: 'It's
absolutely abominable. We now face a month of complete uncertainty over our
input prices with no idea what may happen at the end of that.'
Mr Bradbury's purchases of raw materials such as flour and sugar cost about
Pounds 300m a year and small changes in exchange rates can have a
significant effect on the company's margins.
The EC's system of floating 'green' rates was introduced at the start of the
year, replacing the previous process of fixing 'green' rates annually.
However, German farm groups strongly opposed the new scheme as they feared
that their payments would fall and they would face too much uncertainty on
prices.
The issue will be discussed at a meeting of agriculture ministers on
September 20, when Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, is
expected to oppose any revision of the current system or a continuation of
the freeze.
UK food processors are furious. Mr Paul Williamson, external affairs
director at Cadbury Schweppes, said: 'We can't plan our business like this.
We had been trying to hedge our currency risk and now this leaves us
exposed.'
The Food and Drink Federation said: 'the system must be transparent and
predictable for as long as it exists. It is of great concern that the rules
agreed last December should be changed arbitrarily and the industry put into
such an uncertain position.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Science foresight plan launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S ambitious 'technology foresight' programme, aimed at
picking areas on which the UK should concentrate research funding, will be
launched today.
Scientists, industrialists and civil servants are meeting in Edinburgh in
the first of a series of eight seminars to be held in different cities this
autumn. They will lay the foundations for the full-scale foresight exercise
next year.
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for science, hopes that this will
involve several thousand people in science and business giving their views
and 'building a consensus on the most important generic technologies for the
future'.
The aim is to match the most promising scientific fields with the country's
research resources and UK companies willing and able to exploit the results
of the research. By 1995 the priorities identified in the foresight exercise
will start to influence the way the government allocates public spending of
about Pounds 5bn a year on research and development.
The technology foresight steering group, chaired by Professor William
Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser, held its first meeting
last week.
Prof Stewart added that group had yet to decide about the technologies on
which to concentrate and the procedures that would be used for choosing
them.
Prof Howard Newby, chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council and
a member of the steering group, said: 'The most important objective in the
early stages must be to create a sense of common purpose between government,
industry and academics.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Newcastle counts social inequality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCENTRATION of unemployment and poverty in many parts of Newcastle
upon Tyne sits uncomfortably alongside the comparative affluence of some of
its suburbs, says City Profiles, a newly published analysis of the 1991
census results for the city.
Census data analysed by Newcastle city council shows stark contrasts between
different areas of the city, with unemployment ranging from 39 per cent in
the West City ward to 6 per cent in Westerhope. The city average is 15.3 per
cent.
The proportion of children in lone-parent households ranges from 43 per cent
in West City to 7 per cent in South Gosforth. The proportion of dependent
children in households with no earner in these wards is respectively 61 per
cent and 5 per cent.
Overall, 21 per cent of the city's under-16s are in single-parent households
and 29.5 per cent - 16,055 - are in households with no earned income.
Other sharp contrasts include car ownership, which ranges by ward from 74
per cent to 16 per cent, and owner occupancy which ranges from 84 per cent
to 8 per cent.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said: 'Ours is
an increasingly unequal city in an increasingly unequal country.'
The report says that Newcastle is generally worse off than most of England's
other 35 metropolitan districts, although it scores better than most for its
proportion of homes with central heating and low levels of overcrowding.
The number of children staying at school after 16 has risen since 1981.
According to the census data Newcastle ranks fourth among the 36 districts
for its levels of children in single-parent and non-earning households and
its male unemployment. Knowsley, Liverpool and Manchester rank higher.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Benefits of rivalry in utilities 'unclear'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UTILITY regulators should pay more attention to consumer interests before
trying to introduce greater competition into household utility services,
because the benefits are far from clear, the National Consumer Council
warns.
The council says in a report issued today that the results of the
privatisation of the gas, water, electricity and telephone industries have
been very mixed and the consumer's interests have not always been served as
well as those of the business user or the shareholder.
The publicly funded council's report says that water charges have risen far
above the rate of inflation because companies have been allowed to pass on
modernisation costs. Electricity prices have risen slightly less than
inflation, but only because companies were obliged to hand back earlier
increases.
Telephone charges appear to have risen faster for small consumers than for
businesses and, while gas prices have fallen, charges for industrial
consumers are much lower than those for households.
The report says that regulation of all these sectors can be improved. But
the answer to high or uneven pricing is not necessarily more competition.
It says: 'The regulators should carry out proper cost/benefit analyses of
the effects of introducing competition into these services. These analyses
must include the implications for domestic consumers.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Modern odyssey ends in Lincoln
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RON Saunders confessed he was 'browned off' yesterday as he joined the
2.25pm Newark to Lincoln train, on the last leg of an epic journey that had
started in Sheffield more than six hours earlier.
To cover the 40 miles between the two cities he had to change trains four
times, at Derby, Nottingham, Grantham and Newark.
He was speaking before he discovered that the 15 services which now run to
Lincoln on a Sunday will be cut to four next month. The city has found
itself the biggest loser in the cuts to BR's winter timetable.
About 24 passengers were on the Blue Sprinter train yesterday. Many had
travelled north on the London to Leeds InterCity line.
A Spanish trawler-owner travelling to Grimsby with a colleague said: 'We
thought of flying to Leeds but we would have had to hire a car and the train
seemed the best option. But it has not been easy . . . Next time I think we
might fly.'
Miss Seze Watt, visiting her cousin, said: 'I came from Nottingham but it
wasn't easy getting here. I had to change at Grantham and Newark.'
Regular users are concerned about the cuts. Mr Gavin Cowley, who uses the
train to travel to York every weekend, said: 'It's going to cause me
difficulties if they take more trains away.'
Mr Rob Bradley, tourism and publicity officer with Lincoln city council,
said about 10 per cent of Lincoln's 1m tourists a year used the railways. He
added: 'The city is a popular stopping-off point for people travelling on
the east coast line to places like York and Edinburgh. They're less likely
to come here if it's made more difficult for them.'
He said that recently Lincoln was turned down for a Nato conference. 'It was
down to a shortlist of two but in the end they decided that since many
delegates would be travelling on Sunday it would be difficult for them to
reach us. That was a disappointment.'
Mr Jim Hanrahan, the council's director of economic development, said: 'We
lost our only direct rail link with London in May, when the timetable was
last reviewed.'
The service, he added, had been gradually run down and business travellers
were increasingly having to travel via Grantham and Newark. 'Without the
connections, the knock-on effect on passenger numbers created a
self-fulfilling prophecy,' he said.
Mr Peter Morrison, seeing off visitors, said: 'We are traditional
Conservatives but I have to say the reality is we feel totally let down by
this.'

BOUNDARY changes designed to increase the number of Euro constituencies in
Wales from four to five were attacked yesterday by Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal
Democrat MP for Montgomery.
He said they involved creating new constituencies through merging Gwynedd
and Dyfed and Powys and Clwyd which were 'geographically and demographically
incompatible'.
Mr Carlile attributed the 'madcap scheme' to the short-circuiting of normal
procedures so that the new boundaries could be in place in time for next
year's European parliamentary elections.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Floating voters 'distrust Labour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOATING VOTERS in south-east England still do not trust the Labour party
and see it as old-fashioned, research published today by the Fabian society
shows, Alison Smith writes.
The study, based on work by Opinion Leader Research in five marginal seats
in the south-east, found that Labour as well as the government was suffering
from a new contempt for all politicians, who were seen as being primarily
self-interested.
It highlights the prospect that at the next election the Liberal Democrats
could take votes not only from the Tories but also from Labour, even where
Labour is a clear challenger to the Conservatives.
Such findings show that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, must still bring
about significant changes in the party's policies and values if it is to win
support in the south.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham north and the pamphlet's co-author,
argues that modernising the party's links with the trade unions is a
critical way of increasing Labour's appeal to white-collar and skilled
manual workers.
Other suggestions include the possibility of specifying how taxes would be
spent on particular services such as health, and removing the party's
constitutional commitment to public ownership.

revealed in the new timetable. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said
the cuts came as part of the approach to privatisation.
In spite of ministerial assurances, the reductions in weekend and off-peak
services will add to the difficulties the government faces next month when
parliament resumes discussion of the legislation to allow the private sector
to bid to run rail services.
Some of the leading Tory rebels are from constituencies in BR's Network
SouthEast area, seen by passenger organisations as one of the areas
particularly badly affected by the changes.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, insisted that the changes were part
of BR's normal management processes. 'This has got absolutely nothing to do
with privatisation,' he told BBC radio.
Mr MacGregor said that the service reductions arose because BR had carried
fewer passengers in the recession, leading to a fall in its revenue.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, accused Mr MacGregor of
'monstrous cynicism' in cutting government funding for BR and predicted that
the issue would intensify the campaign against privatisation.
Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said: 'This confirms
all our worst fears - that to try to make the franchises more attractive to
private bidders, the whole public-service commitment is being slimmed down.
The regional railways have been warning for some time that the level of
funding the government was proposing for next year was going to mean massive
cuts.'
Mr Kenneth Carlisle, a former transport minister, is to lead a cross-party
delegation of MPs to meet Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, next
month to discuss rail services. He is the MP for Lincoln, one of the areas
worst hit by the cuts.
Tory MPs who rebelled when the privatisation legislation was debated in the
Commons earlier this year have already said that plans for substantial fare
increases would stiffen their determination to demand further concessions
from the government.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Cable revolution rumbles into the residential zones: The
established telecoms providers are facing stiff competition from new
operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL RECENTLY most of us had no choice but to use British
Telecommunications at home. Mercury was something for business, and cable
companies were almost nowhere.
No longer. Mercury now has 375,000 domestic subscribers linked to its trunk
network. Cable companies, building local telephone networks across Britain's
urban areas, have signed up 164,000 residential customers - more than treble
the tally a year ago.
That is just the start. Most new phones have a blue button, giving direct
connection to Mercury for Pounds 11.75 a year. For those with old phones, a
new Mercury service will enable about half of all BT subscribers to use
Mercury by dialling 132 before their long-distance number. By the end of the
year '132' will be available in most areas with modern telephone exchanges.
Londoners can sign up now, and a marketing blitz is imminent.
As for cable, 14.5m homes are covered by franchises granted to companies to
build combined cable telephone and television networks. A total of 27
companies - 20 of them North American - have 127 franchises between them.
Networks are under construction in 62 areas and others will start later this
year. Virtually all cable subscribers have severed their BT connections,
relying for their long-distance calls on inter-connection agreements
negotiated by the cable companies, mostly with Mercury.
The sight of yet another outfit digging up the streets has not endeared the
cable companies to their potential customers. And once the roads are
re-surfaced many are reluctant to ask about the services for fear of
invasion by sales teams.
The salespeople come anyway. A day in the Portsmouth area, where Nynex, the
US-owned cable operator, is constructing one of its 18 networks, revealed a
high degree of enthusiasm for the new services. To Nynex's surprise, cable
telephone is proving more popular than cable television.
Nynex's team of 38 'cable advisers' are trudging the streets of Portsmouth
and its environs, armed with glossy brochures showing large savings on phone
bills and the benefits of 29 basic TV channels and another six premium
channels.
So far council estates have offered the richest pickings. On the city's Lee
Park estate take-up is more than 40 per cent. But it is significant across
the franchise area, which extends from Fareham in the west to Petersfield in
the north. A team out for a week in Fareham reported 27 per cent of homes
visited taking cable telephone, 25 per cent cable TV, and nearly 30 per cent
one or the other.
A few months after their initial foray the advisers go back to 're-market'.
One city area re-marketed in July was reporting total take-up of more than
38 per cent. Telephone was again the best seller, attracting 35 per cent of
homes visited compared with 32 per cent for cable TV. 'Without the advisers,
we'd get nowhere,' said Mr Karl Gross, managing director of the Nynex's
Solent franchise and a former Unilever executive. 'We need them to get over
people's hesitation that we're double-glazing merchants.'
The advisers are paid Pounds 70 a week. The rest is down to them, with
commissions paid not just on sales, but on everything including direct
debits, worth a pound each to them. An average sale earns an adviser Pounds
15.
One experienced hand said: 'It's not particularly hard-sell. You start with
the average 10 per cent off the phone bill, that always gets you a hearing.
Then you throw in the TV.' Once word has gone around, the job is far easier.
Those taking cable telephone were mainly concerned to save money. They
seemed to accept the glossy charts showing that they would save by switching
to Nynex - although some might be better off keeping their BT line using
Mercury for trunk calls (see table).
Few were worried about having to change their phone number. They wanted to
be assured about reliability and long-distance links. Mention of Nynex's US
experience and its connection to Mercury's long-distance network was enough
for most people. Surprisingly, BT seemed to be doing nothing in response,
apart from letters advertising its 'Option 15' discount rate.
Nynex's connection charge for TV is Pounds 35.99. An extra Pounds 20 (Pounds
15 for direct debit subscribers) gets you the phone too. The phone alone
comes for Pounds 60 (Pounds 55 with direct debit). Over 60s and the disabled
gain installation free, provided they take both the phone and TV. Perks
include itemised phone bills for all calls costing more than 20p. The
monthly telephone line rental is Pounds 6.45, with itemised billing for all
calls of more than 20p.
Portsmouth is Nynex's most advanced network, but Blackburn, Brighton,
Bromley, Derby, Bolton and north Surrey are progressing. The jewel in the
company's UK crown is Manchester, where work will start later this year. Mr
Eugene Connell, Nynex's UK director said: 'We plan to spend around Dollars
3bn in the UK over the next five years - our commitment is total.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Rail users face big cuts in services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL PASSENGERS face big cuts in timetables this winter as British Rail
tries to weed out uneconomic services in the approach to privatisation.
Worst hit will be regional Sunday services - some of which will lose all
their trains - and early morning and late-night services on Network
SouthEast.
British Rail admitted that as many as 2.5m seats may go from the winter
timetable, but said there is no question of the cuts having been imposed by
the board.
BR said winter timetabling was an issue for the three BR divisions, Regional
Railways, Network SouthEast and InterCity, and decisions were taken at local
level.
But it had to match resources to demand, it added. The subsidy to BR for
running socially necessary services has been cut by 25 per cent this year
from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 850m so BR had little choice but to make cuts.
'There has been a significant decline on some services and there is no point
in running empty trains,' it said.
Sunday services in central England appear to be bearing the brunt of the
cuts, with the city of Lincoln particularly badly affected.
Regional Railways confirmed that from October there would be no Sunday
service between Lincoln and Cleethorpes, no direct service between Lincoln
and Nottingham and only an afternoon service between Lincoln and Newark and
Grantham.
Sunday services between Derby and Matlock, a gateway to the Peak District,
are also being withdrawn because the service carried an average of only 12
passengers per journey last winter, it said.
In Wales the Pwllheli/ Machynlleth Sunday service is being withdrawn and the
number of return trains from Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury on a Sunday is being
cut from three to two.
In East Anglia an agreement with Norfolk and Suffolk county councils on
subsidising local routes safeguarded the Sunday services betweeen Norwich
and Sheringham, Lowestoft, and Great Yarmouth and between Ipswich and
Lowestoft and Cambridge, it said.
Network SouthEast denied that it was cutting any services but did admit that
re-timetabling to meet demand might result in the number of off-peak trains
on some routes being reduced.
The London/Weymouth line had been given as an example of a cut in service,
it said. But there was little point in running three trains an hour if there
was only demand for two. Rationalising the timetable would only
inconvenience someone wishing to travel to Weymouth by delaying their
journey by a maximum of 10 minutes.
Any reduction in the number of early morning and late evening trains was
purely to reflect falling demand. The number of commuters travelling to
London on Network Southeast each day had fallen from 473,000 in 1989 to
377,000.
But even with this winter's further reduction in the number of trains
Network SouthEast expects to have 9 per cent more seats than passengers in
the mornings.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Tariffs maze baffles consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAFFLEMENT IS the reaction of most consumers to the growing competition
between telephone companies for their custom. But it pays to consider
shifting from BT.
For most users the choice is simple. There are two national fixed-line
operators - BT and Mercury. BT is invariably cheaper for local calls, while
Mercury is generally cheaper for long-distance and international calls,
especially in the evenings and at weekends.
It generally pays to join Mercury if you make more than about Pounds
15-worth of long-distance calls a quarter. Mercury subscribers still use BT
for local calls, and can take advantage of any BT special offers which
undercut Mercury on certain calls.
Both BT and Mercury offer volume discounts. BT's standard tariffs are
automatically reduced by 5 per cent for calls made after your bill has
reached Pounds 88.13 in a quarter. Mercury's are cut by 5 per cent when you
reach Pounds 23.50 a month. BT gives a further discount after Pounds 293.75
a quarter, and its 'Option 15' gives 10 per cent off all direct-dialled
calls in return for a quarterly fee of Pounds 4.
Since Mercury guarantees a saving of at least 20 per cent on BT off-peak
basic rates for long-distance calls, most high-volume private customers are
likely to be better off with Mercury.
With a local cable operator the choice is more complicated. The table lists
Nynex's present tariffs. Each of the cable operators has its own, and the
figures should not be taken to apply to the others. For instance, some
companies offer free local calls between phones on their networks.
Nynex's line rental is Pounds 1.20 a month cheaper than BT's, and its
off-peak tariffs are about 2 per cent to 20 per cent below BT standard
rates. Nynex says that for a Pounds 45 quarterly phone bill with a 'typical'
distribution of calls, it is about 12 per cent cheaper than BT.
Nynex has no volume discounts, however, and without them some of its
long-distance and international tariffs work out more expensive than BT's.
Cable subscribers also lose their BT connections unless they pay to keep
them up.
Nynex offers its services in conjunction with Mercury, yet for many
long-distance calls it is far cheaper to use Mercury via a BT connection.
You cannot take advantage of standard Mercury tariffs via a Nynex
connection.
Mr Ian Duncan, a Nynex marketing manager, conceded: 'We do not say that we
are cheaper on every call - it's very confusing.'
As competition intensifies, so will the confusion. So too will the number of
cut-price deals on offer - provided you have a good eye for tariff sheets
that look like railway timetables.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Ernst &amp; Young raps accounts reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the UK's third largest accountancy firm, today launches an
outspoken attack on the Accounting Standards Board's plans to reform rules
governing financial reporting.
An Ernst &amp; Young report accuses the board, which sets accounting standards,
of heading in the wrong direction with its reforms, being overly academic,
ignoring its critics and diverging from international standards.
Ernst &amp; Young warns that the board threatens to sideline the traditional
concept of prudence in accounts.
The strongly worded criticism is one of the first public expressions of
discontent with the overall development of the new accounting standards
regime.
It is particularly significant because it was co-authored by Mr Ron
Paterson, a technical partner in the firm, who is a member of the board's
urgent issues task force.
Ernst &amp; Young's main concern is that the board is concentrating on the
so-called 'balance sheet approach' which focuses on attempting to value a
company's assets and liabilities regularly.
The firm argues that this is inaccurate and incompatible with a 'profit and
loss account approach' based on transactions - such as the sale of goods -
that have taken place and so can be measured with greater certainty. It
wants a return to 'historical cost' accounting, based on the value of an
asset at the time it was bought.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, said
yesterday: 'Most of what we are doing is just catching up with standards
elsewhere in the world.' The proposals would 'improve the balance sheet
without destroying the profit and loss account'. Ernst &amp; Young was 'in a
minority', with most users of accounts favouring regular revaluations on the
balance sheet and 70 per cent of British industry already doing so, he said.
Until now there has been a delicate consensus, with few companies and no
accounting firms speaking out directly against the board's reform programme.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Price of milk 'may rise 15%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS in England and Wales could pay 15 per cent more for their milk
when the industry goes to a free market next April, Mr Neil Davidson, group
executive at Northern Foods, has warned.
At the end of July the government abolished the Milk Marketing Board, which
has controlled milk sales and distribution since the 1930s. The board is due
to submit proposals for its re-organisation by the end of September and
plans to turn itself into a voluntary co-operative.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the board, has promised farmers price
rises of several pence per litre for their milk if they join the board's
successor, Milk Marque. He said recently that farmers in the UK should
become among the highest-paid dairy producers in Europe.
Mr Davidson said that the price rise would be paid for by consumers. 'Under
the new system, Milk Marque looks as if it will remain a monopoly and it
will impose those price rises on the marketplace. We will inevitably pass
them onto consumers.'
Northern Foods has set up the Northern Milk Partnership to buy directly from
farmers. The company believes it will have to pay a premium above the Milk
Marque price if it is to secure its supplies, as England and Wales do not
produce enough milk for their own needs. Separate arrangements are being
made in Scotland.
MD Foods, a UK company indirectly owned by a Danish farmers' co-operative,
last week sent brochures to 8,500 farmers offering to buy their milk in the
new competitive marketplace.
Farmers located close to processing plants are being wooed most strongly by
the dairy companies, which want to buy their milk directly. But the Milk
Marketing Board believes Milk Marque will still persuade between 60 per cent
and 80 per cent of the dairy producers in England and Wales to stick with
it.
Nevertheless, Mr Clarke believes the free market will lead to a shake-out
among dairy producers, with smaller and more remote farmers going out of
business, and a fall in the number of farmers from 29,000 now to 20,000 by
the year 2000.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Peps-type tax allowances urged for gilts investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE INVESTORS in gilt-edged stocks and corporate bonds should receive
similar tax allowances to investors in equities, a Budget submission by the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds urges.
The association proposes the establishment of 'personal gilt plans'
involving a Pounds 3,000 personal equity plan-type allowance for gilts and
corporate bonds.
Tax relief for investment in gilts and corporate bonds would assist the
government in funding the public sector borrowing requirement and would
encourage investors in Britain to build up a well-balanced investment
portfolio, the association says.
It estimates that the unit trust industry could sell up to Pounds 1bn of
gilts and bonds through personal gilt plans. In the past tax year nearly
Pounds 2bn was invested in unit trust Peps.
It recommends that the PGP tax treatment should be extended to corporate
bonds, as it would help ensure that finance was available for British
industry over the next few years of a recovery.
The association's Budget submission also says that gilt funds should be
removed altogether from the net covering capital gains tax.
It points out that investors in gilt unit trusts pay capital gains tax on
disposal of units, unlike those who invest directly in gilts.
The association also makes a case for the removal of stamp duty where it
impedes the development of the unit trust market.
It says this would improve the efficiency of the industry by reducing costs
to the investor without reducing tax revenue.
The association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds represents 120 unit
trust management companies.

FT  13 SEP 93 / The black anniversary turns golden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS Thursday marks the anniversary of Black Wednesday. It has been 12
months in which the UK economy has enjoyed a golden period - at least in
comparison with what went before. Sterling's exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism on September 16 was a big factor behind the 1.3 per cent
growth in gross domestic product between the third quarter of 1992 and the
second quarter this year, writes Peter Marsh.
Coming after the deep recession which started during 1990 and petered out
around the middle of last year, such a large expansion in output would
almost certainly not have happened had the pound stayed in the mechanism.
Sterling's decoupling from the D-Mark has enabled the UK government to cut
interest rates from 10 per cent to 6 per cent, boosting domestic demand.
That particularly helped manufacturers, which have pushed up output 2.6 per
cent in the past year. They have been aided by the 11 per cent depreciation
in sterling (on a trade-weighted basis) over the period which has increased
competitiveness.
And while unemployment remains high, it has come down from a record 2.99m in
January.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Businesses seek easier financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 20-POINT programme to make it easier for small and medium-sized companies
to obtain finance during the hoped-for economic recovery will be unveiled to
the Treasury this week by the Association of Independent Businesses, a lobby
group.
The ideas from the association, representing about 12,000 companies, will
feed into a six-month study by the Treasury into whether 'market
imperfections' distort the flow of cash into industry and so impede growth.
The suggestions include putting greater pressure on banks to fund small
companies, and tax changes to release more cash for industrial investment.
They will be relayed at a meeting on Wednesday between the association and
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr Dorrell is
expected to discuss the proposals with Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic
secretary, who is in charge of the funding inquiry.
Mr Toby Aykroyd, director of operations at the association, welcomed the
Treasury study. He said it was important to lay the ground for 'medium-term
reforms' in the financing of small companies.
He said new ideas to help the sector might be needed, especially during the
expected upturn over the next year or so.
The meeting with Mr Dorrell was set up before last week's announcement of
the Treasury study, which will be based on a series of visits by Mr Nelson
to small companies around Britain. Mr Nelson will also talk to City
institutions and banks to discuss funding problems.
Proposals from the association include:
Persuading banks to give more information about their loans to small
companies, including those made under the government's loan guarantee
scheme, so that lobbying groups can better assess the banks' record in this
area.
Revamping of the business expansion scheme to provide tax advantages for
companies and individuals when investing in small companies.
Extra capital allowances to enable small companies to claim tax relief
against investments.
Increased grants to reduce burden of business rates. Extensions in schemes
to enable small companies to offset financial losses against tax on later
profits.
The study by Mr Nelson follows efforts by the Treasury over the past year to
form a better understanding of business issues. The inquiry was welcomed by
the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors. Mr
Stan Mendham, founder of the 21,000-member Forum of Private Businesses, said
funding of small companies was 'monumentally important' to the UK's economic
health.

FT  13 SEP 93 / West End offices go to French for Pounds 62m

TWO FRENCH insurance companies have paid Pounds 62.5m for an office building
in London's St James's Square, in one of the largest West End property
transactions this year.
The deal illustrates the prominence of overseas investors in the UK property
market, resulting from the devaluation of sterling, the reduction in UK
interest rates and the opportunity to buy properties at historically high
yields.
Foreign buyers are likely to spend about Pounds 1.75bn on UK property this
year, compared with Pounds 1.33bn in 1992, says a report by DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, property advisers.
The building at 20 St James's Square has been acquired by GAN and UAP, two
of France's largest insurance companies, from Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese
developer, on a yield of just under 7.5 per cent.
The 70,000 sq ft offices - occupied by Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks
and retailing group - generates an income of Pounds 4.75m a year from one of
the highest rents in London. Grand Metropolitan has a 25-year lease, agreed
in 1990.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe says demand for UK property is the highest for at least
five years. UK financial institutions are preparing to invest more than
Pounds 7bn in the next 12 to 18 months as money flows back into commercial
property.
Overseas investment in UK property totalled Pounds 837m for the first half
of this year, according to DTZ - about the same level as the last six months
of last year.
Hong Kong and Chinese investors have been the most prominent source of
demand, accounting for nearly a quarter of investment so far this year.
Investors from the Far East have spent Pounds 195m for the first half of
this year, compared with a total of Pounds 63m last year.

THE FORMER Thai prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, showed he has lost
none of his flair for the unexpected by announcing the creation of a 90-seat
party late on Friday night.
However, the merger of four opposition parties with a party in the ruling
coalition government appeared to have already run into trouble yesterday as
key members of Mr Chatichai's party angrily rejected the scheme.
The initiative is widely seen as the ageing disco-loving Chatichai's last
desperate tilt at the premiership, risking severe damage to his own Chart
Pattana (National Development) party for the sake of inconveniencing the
government.
'Chatichai knows that at his age he can't wait two or three years for the
next election - but this smacks of desperation,' said the political analyst
of a western embassy.
The 73-year-old Mr Chatichai - who was ousted by a military junta in
February 1991 - has endured a year in opposition without being able
seriously to trouble the five-party coalition government despite repeated
criticism of prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai for cautious and lacklustre
leadership.
The new 90-seat strong political party is supposed to take over the name of
the current Social Action party which seems certain to be kicked out of the
ruling coalition.
The 21-member strong Social Action party was only brought into the coalition
to shore up the thin five-seat majority of the four 'angelic' parties who
opposed a military junta's domination of politics and subsequently won last
September's pivotal general election.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Ex-Wardley head faces bribe charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR EWAN LAUNDER, the former head of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation's merchant banking arm, Wardley, who was arrested on Friday in
connection with the collapse of the Carrian empire in 1983, is expected to
appear as a key witness in the trial of Carrian's chairman, Mr George Tan.
Mr Launder is considered the front-man for Hongkong Bank's substantial
dealings with the group.
Scotland Yard yesterday confirmed Mr Launder was arrested by officers
attached to the internationally organised crime branch. He was seized on
Friday at the request of Hong Kong police as he flew into Heathrow.
Mr Launder appeared in Bow Street magistrate's court on Saturday, and is
facing extradition to Hong Kong on charges of accepting HKDollars 45m
(Pounds 3.8m) in personal bribes from Carrian group companies. He was
remanded in custody at Brixton jail until Friday.
The arrest follows last month's return to the UK by Mr Lorrain Osman, who
had been expected to play the role of key witness in the continuing
investigations into Mr Tan. Mr Osman's return, after 15 charges against him
were dropped, had led to the expectation that the Carrian affair, Hong
Kong's most notorious corporate scandal, was finally drawing to a close.
Carrian was formed from a shell listed company in 1979, and emerged as a
massive property investor in the early 1980's; Wardley acted as financial
adviser and financier from the outset. Carrian collapsed in 1983 with
estimated debts of more than HKDollars 10bn, and Mr Launder left Wardley in
the same year.
The case has cost Hong Kong taxpayers more than HKDollars 100m, but there is
little sense in Hong Kong that justice has been done.
Mr Tan, his righthand-man Bentley Ho, and two partners of Price Waterhouse -
Carrian's accountants - faced criminal charges, but were let off in 1987.
Further controversy came with the murder of a Malaysian investigator into
the scandal and with the suicide in 1984 of an eminent lawyer, connected
with Carrian, who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool with a manhole
cover around his neck.
In 1988, Mr Stewart Turner, a former employee of Barclays Asia, was found
guilty of accepting bribes in relation to a loan given to Carrian. Mr Osman
also pleaded guilty of defrauding Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Corporation by
authorising loans to a company controlled by Mr Tan.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Structural barriers to eastward enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMBINATION of Europe's deepening recession and the collapse of the hard
version of the exchange rate mechanism in July appear effectively to have
placed the final nail in the coffin of the Maastricht treaty. Europe badly
needs to take a new economic direction, but no one seems to know what it
should be.
But there is one option which most EC member countries appear determined to
rule out: enlargement to the east. A senior diplomat from one of the EC's
largest southern European member countries confirmed last week both that the
Maastricht timetable for monetary union was impossible but that his country
had no option but to try to stick to it. As for switching the agenda from
monetary deepening to membership widening, his response was an emphatic No.
At first sight, the reason for this adamant opposition to eastward
enlargement seems obvious. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are all
endowed with cheap and relatively skilled labour. They thus seem to pose a
threat to industrial competitiveness in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland,
especially if the potentially highly restrictive east European Association
Agreements were to be replaced by full membership of the Single Market.
But the view that the southern European countries stand to be hurt more if
trade with the east is liberalised is misconceived, as the European
Commission has highlighted in a recent study. In fact, the research,
conducted by National Economic Research Associates, the London-based
consultancy, finds that the Community's 'lagging' regions (Greece, Portugal,
the Irish republic, Northern Ireland, southern Italy and most of Spain)
stand to gain most from successful reform in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union.
In the short-term, the Commission report estimates that the EC area would be
a net loser from open trade if reforms succeeded, although the fall in
output would be a tiny 0.2 per cent. As east European imports of
manufactures and agricultural goods grew, so the net impact of open
manufacturing trade would turn positive, and outweigh agricultural losses.
By the year 2010, the report estimates total EC output would have risen 0.8
per cent.
But the poorer, lagging, regions are net beneficiaries from the beginning,
with Greece, southern Italy and Spain reaping most of the benefits. Output
is projected to rise for all the main categories of manufactures in the
lagging regions, with the exception of iron and steel. And the projected
gains in manufacturing output are substantial - 0.4 per cent by 1995 and 2.2
per cent by 2010. For Spain and Portugal, this relative success is almost
entirely explained by a mix of industries and products which are better
suited to the import needs of the east European countries. For Greece, this
industry effect is supplemented by its geographical proximity to the
emerging markets.
Why then are the southern European countries so opposed to eastward
enlargement, and determined to stick to the Maastricht timetable? The reason
is the EC's Ecu157bn (Pounds 120bn) aid budget. Over the period 1994-99 the
EC plans to distribute Ecu141.5bn in structural funds to the EC's backward
regions. A further Ecu15.5bn should be paid out by 1999 to Ireland, Spain,
Portugal and Greece through the cohesion fund as compensation for signing
the Maastricht treaty.
But allowing the east or central European countries to join the Community
would undermine southern Europe's claim on this aid budget, while
recognising that the Maastricht timetable is dead removes the rationale for
the cohesion funds. The risk for the EC is that locking the east European
countries out may mean an even larger aid burden if reforms fail. But this
is a threat that the southern European countries appear unwilling to
contemplate.

reform in central and eastern Europe. Commission of the European

A SPECIAL team has been set up by the Indian government, involving the Home
Office and official investigative agencies, to investigate the car bombs
outside the Youth Congress (I) office in Delhi's high security zone which
killed eight people and injured at least 40 others on Saturday.
The police said yesterday that initial investigations have revealed the
involvement of Punjab terrorist groups.
Mr Maninderjit Singh Bitta, the Youth Congress (I) president, whom police
suspect was the target of the attack, escaped with minor injuries. Mr
Bitta's car was leaving the gate of his office when two powerful bombs went
off.
Meanwhile, the four main leaders of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata
party are campaigning nationally against government plans to legislate a
separation of religion and politics ahead of elections in four states.
Bharom Singh Shekhawat, sacked former chief minister of Rajasthan, is
pictured waving during a rally in Jammu over the weekend.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Clinton still requires a winning Nafta vision: The
president's uphill battle to win the hearts of Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton tomorrow formally launches his uphill battle to make the
North American Free Trade Agreement acceptable to a dubious US Congress.
With ex-presidents Bush, Carter and Ford expected at the White House for a
Rose Garden ceremony, Mr Clinton will sign the supplemental agreements on
labour, environment and import surges negotiated over seven months with
Canada and Mexico.
The White House is also hoping to acquire the salesmanship skills of Mr Lee
Iacocca, former head of Chrysler and a pitchman notable enough to challenge
Mr Ross Perot, leader of the strong Nafta opposition.
There is now a determination in the White House to portray the pact, along
with its side agreements, as 'Clinton's Nafta' and therefore one which
should be more acceptable to labour and environmentalists. However, if the
side pacts have won any adherents, they have yet to announce their
conversion.
As is usual with trade issues, the spotlight is on Mr Richard Gephardt, the
House majority leader, whose backing is seen as key to Nafta's passage in
the House. Mr Gephardt leaves a tantalising opening in his current
insistence that he cannot support the pact - as it stands.
Mr Gephardt has been demanding for a long time a fixed funding source,
dedicated to pay for environmental clean-ups at the US-Mexican border and
for worker retraining. An outline of the financing plans may be released
tomorrow.
The administration plans to propose a scaled down version of a North
American Development Bank. However, this could be expanded by Congress,
where there is support for an institution capable also of start-up business
loans in districts threatened by job losses.
Currently, the proposal is to limit the Nadbank to environmental projects at
the border and to locate it within the InterAmerican Development Bank.
However, congressional supporters of a larger bank may well prevail when the
plan gets to Capitol Hill.
It has been suggested that Mr Gephardt might find acceptable a cross-border
tax which would provide the embryonic funding for a Nadbank. The tax would
be 'finite' - in place only until it raised the Dollars 600m (Pounds 390m)
currently envisaged from the US and Mexico for paid-in capital - which may
make it acceptable to the business lobby.
Vice President Al Gore yesterday suggested that the implementation of Nafta
may be delayed beyond its scheduled launch on January 1 1994. He
acknowledged that the vote may not come until early next year, but scoffed
at press reports that the administration is backing away from the
controversial agreement.
The White House has established a Nafta 'war room', reminiscent of the
quick-response team which won high praise for its wit and speed in last
year's presidential campaign. Nafta captains are in place - Mr Bill Daley,
an accomplished Democratic backroom deal-maker, and Mr Bill Frenzel, a
former Minnesota Republican congressman - although neither has been visible
much in public.
Mr Clinton's lack of enthusiasm in defending Nafta has fuelled doubts about
his commitment to the cause. He has seemed remote from the fray, unable to
inspire the public and unwilling to articulate a vision of an expanded home
market with more jobs to gain than to lose. He can hardly be pleased about
the rift it is creating between the moderate and liberal wings of the
Democratic party.
However, reports that the White House is backing away from Nafta have
'enraged' the administration. One jubilant official said: 'The political
will is there; the fight is now starting.'

THE NEW Japanese government is expected on Thursday to unveil an emergency
economic stimulation package worth up to Y5,000bn (Pounds 30.7bn), officials
said over the weekend.
This will be the second such package this year after a Y13,200bn public
spending plan adopted by the former LDP government last April.
It marks the depth of concern in the one-month-old coalition at the
unexpected length of the economic slowdown, highlighted last Friday with the
publication of the Bank of Japan's latest survey on business confidence.
Manufacturing industry was at its gloomiest for 18 years, since the
aftermath of the first oil price shock, and there was no immediate sign of
an upturn, said the survey.
The new stimulus package will include cash for improvements to Japan's
heavily loaded infrastructure, a Y2,000bn increase in public housing loans,
Y1,000bn of aid to small business, and Y1,000bn spending on social projects
such as urban improvements for the elderly, according to Japanese press
reports. This will be funded by a supplementary budget, to be presented to
parliament in November, officials were quoted as saying.
The package will also include details of the government's drive to curb
business regulations and to pass on the benefits of the yen's strength to
consumers in the form of lower prices.
Details will be studied closely by financial markets, eager to see how the
government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa plans to fight off recession. It will
also be watched by the US government, which is keen to see evidence that
Tokyo is working hard to stimulate import demand as the latest round of
talks on Japan's trade surplus gets under way.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S largest political party has postponed until September 21 its
decision on whether to break with the government of President Itamar Franco.
The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), which held its
national convention yesterday, decided on the postponement to win more time
for both sides to solve their disagreements, which include personal and
policy differences.
Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state,
is heading a small but powerful group of party leaders who are critical of
the president and his government. They also fear the PMDB will suffer in
presidential and congressional elections next year if the party remains
linked to President Itamar's unpopular government.
Another wing of the party, probably in the majority, is afraid that breaking
with the government would throw Brazil into crisis. The PMDB guarantees the
government's majority in Congress and a withdrawal of support would put in
doubt reviews of the constitution and fiscal reform due to start later this
year.
Another reason for the PMDB's delay was concern that Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, finance minister, was preparing an economic 'shock' plan to tackle
inflation, running at an annual 2,000 per cent.
Mr Cardoso had intended to address the nation on television tomorrow to give
an update on Brazil's economic situation. He is now thought to have
cancelled the TV appearance in a bid to stop speculation about 'shock'
plans.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Nato plans 50,000 Bosnia deployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NATO is developing a plan to send about 50,000 peacekeeping troops to
Bosnia, up to half of them Americans, if agreement is reached to end the
civil war, Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, said yesterday.
At a meeting in Brussels before flying to Rome to discuss the proposal with
US military officials, Mr Aspin confirmed for the first time the number
involved but said the US Congress was likely to veto American participation
unless European allies provided half the troops.
'We are talking overall numbers of around 50,000 total - that would be US
and western allies,' Mr Aspin told a meeting of the International Institute
of Strategic Studies (IISS) in Brussels.
Separately, Germany is lobbying to appoint a German national to head a
European Community team to restore order to the ruined Bosnian town of
Mostar, in the event of a peace deal between Moslems, Croats and Serbs in
the Bosnian conflict.
German officials confirmed the Bonn government's interest in taking a high
profile administration role in Mostar if the warring parties resolved their
differences in peace talks in Geneva. 'It would be one of the first examples
of a common European security and foreign policy,' said one.
Germany's ambiguous constitutional restrictions on the deployment of
military force overseas and its involvement in atrocities in Yugoslavia in
the second world war makes it impossible for Germany to take part in a
UN/Nato peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
Appointment of a German national to help restore basic facilities in Mostar
would show the Bonn government is anxious to 'do its bit' in former
Yugoslavia, an EC official said.
Lord Owen, EC negotiator, suggested during an upbeat presentation on
Saturday to EC foreign ministers meeting in eastern Belgium that an
agreement might only be weeks away. But this depended on all three parties
showing flexibility and he was not yet ready to reconvene peace talks.
Talks are focusing on encouraging the Croats to guarantee Bosnian Moslems
access to the Adriatic Sea.
Ministers are also trying to persuade the Serbs to open up safe corridors
between Bosnian-held territory. It is understood Greece is being used as an
intermediary, passing the message that Serb concessions would lead to a
swift lifting of EC sanctions.
General Jean Cot, commander of UN peacekeeping forces in the former
Yugoslavia, was attempting yesterday to mediate a truce between Croat and
Serb forces to end four days of clashes in Croatia, UN officials said,
Reuter reports from Zagreb.
In earlier talks with the Croatian army chief, Gen Cot stressed that
Croatian troops should withdraw from three villages in southern Croatia
captured in a snap offensive on Thursday. The rebel Serb command in the
Krajina enclave threatened to use new weapons in 'massive retaliation'
unless Croats pulled back.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Socialist victory will hit economy, says Mitsotakis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, kicked off his
re-election campaign at the weekend by warning that the economy would face
serious problems if the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) came to
power.
Mr Mitsotakis, whose government was toppled last week by defections from his
New Democracy party, also claimed the socialists' pledge to call off the
privatisation programme would disrupt Greece's bid to achieve economic
convergence with its EC partners.
'There will be a new haemorrhage of deficits. The Greek people will be
called on to pay out a huge amount if privatisation is abandoned,' he told
an audience of Greek businessmen in Thessaloniki.
Whatever the outcome of the October 10 election, called seven months before
the expiry of the conservatives' mandate, delays in revenue raising can be
expected. Budget projections for 1993, the first year of Greece's five-year
convergence plan, include at least Dr330bn (Pounds 930m) in privatisation
revenues.
Nevertheless, Pasok's intention of cancelling negotiations for the sale of
public utilities and rolling back recent legislation permitting private
operators to build and run power plants would damage chances of attracting
investment.
Mr Mitsotakis also warned that any serious deviation from the convergence
targets, which include reducing government borrowing from 9.6 per cent of
gross domestic product in 1992 to 0.7 per cent in 1998 and halving the
public debt, would mean that transfers from EC structural funds would be
held back.
Greece's current account deficit is held at manageable levels by steadily
rising EC transfers, with up to Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.24bn) due to be disbursed
in the next five years.
The conservatives, their popularity eroded by a three-year decline in real
incomes and rising unemployment, are well aware they will have an uphill
struggle to stay in power.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Rearguard fight over Polish sell-offs - A
lool at attempts to discredit policy ahead of next week's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION is a controversial issue in the Polish election campaign and
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's privatisation minister, knows he is fighting
a rearguard action in the run-up to voting on September 19.
Opinion polls show his pro-privatisation Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD)
party, which played a key role in several post-communist governments, could
fail to win the 5 per cent of votes needed to enter parliament.
Mr Lewandowski, a 42-year-old economist, is under attack from left wing and
populist rivals anxious to discredit the KLD's privatisation record. On the
campaign trail in Poznan province in western Poland he described himself as
the most controversial minister in the government.
'I feel like a bomb disposal specialist,' he said, aware that almost every
decision he takes could blow up in his face. 'It would be safest to do
nothing,' he said at meetings last week, 'but then many of the companies
which only exist because they were privatised would have disappeared long
ago'.
The attacks, which Mr Lewandowski labelled as 'a pack of lies of Himalayan
proportions,' relate to his ministry's efforts to privatise more than a
quarter of the nearly 8,500 state sector enterprises and the sale to foreign
and domestic investors of 76 former state-owned companies.
Formal privatisation remains bogged down by bureaucratic and political
obstacles, but the explosive growth of new private companies means that more
than half the Polish workforce in employment now has jobs in the private
sector.
Mr Lewandowski's main aim after the election is to press ahead with a mass
privatisation scheme (MPP) involving the sale of shares, at a nominal
charge, in more than 400 state-sector companies, to be managed by
western-style investment funds with western managers.
Critics of the MPP have found ammunition in reports prepared by the Supreme
Chamber of Control (NIK), an official audit body which has faulted the
procedures followed in the privatisation of more than 60 plants.
Mr Lewandowski pointed out that the NIK was set up to assess a completely
different economic system. 'Most of the criticism dates back to 1991 when we
at the ministry were learning to privatise and NIK was learning how to
conduct inquiries in new conditions.'
But the pressure from NIK is one of the reasons why privatisation is so
slow. 'I look at each deal as it would be viewed by a NIK controller,' he
told employees and management during an electoral meeting at Pozmeat, a
Poznan state-owned meat works which has been trying to join the private
sector since 1989.
Everyone at the plant wants the minister to move ahead as quickly as
possible in order to face the challenge from long-established private-sector
meat processors in the area.
The hitch is that the former owners of one of the production units have laid
a claim for compensation and some equity has to be set aside in case the
claim is justified.
Shares at a discount are also due by law to be sold to farmers who supply
meat to the works, although the bulk of Pozmeat's suppliers were state farms
now in their death throes.
'The farmers won't buy the shares but we have to make provision for them,'
Mr Lewandowski patiently explained last week in the century-old plant's
assembly hall.
Poznan prides itself on its traditions of order, hard work and reliability,
and Mr Lewandowski is hoping these will favour his cause. In 1991 the KLD
won a mere 7 per cent of the national vote, but 12 per cent in Poznan. 'I'm
standing here because I do a difficult job which needs to be understood and
people here have a better feel for economics than elsewhere,' he told a
sparsely attended election meeting at Szamotuly, north west of Poznan.
Mr Lewandowski is taking no chances with a potentially explosive decision
over the future of a local company, the Goplana confectionery plant.
Goplana, with 10 per cent of the domestic market, has been working for more
than two years towards a merger with E D and F Man, the sugar and cocoa
brokers, and Elite Industries, an Israeli chocolate and food processor. Man,
which says it will invest Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 24.3m) in the plant has been
challenged by Nestle, which has offered to pay the Treasury Dollars 40m for
control of the company and invest a further Dollars 30m. 'This is a conflict
between the head and the heart,' Mr Lewandowski said, adding he would visit
the plant before deciding what to do, but 'not just yet'. Whatever he
decides, however, he knows he will be criticised.
'If I go with Man I will be attacked for failing to secure budget revenues.
If we sell to Nestle there will be hell to pay locally,' he mused.
The atmosphere is calmer at Metalplast, a metal panels producer established
in the 1970s to build the new factories put up under the western-financed
investment boom.
Over the past four years Metalplast has started to provide commercial rather
than industrial buildings. It ended last year with a 36bn zlotys (Pounds
1.2m) net profit and has voted to enter the MPP.
But even here, where unemployment is low, the doubts linger. 'We went into
the programme because the employees are keen to get the 15 per cent of the
equity that entry will give them, and we need a modernisation loan,' said Mr
Marek Szczesny, managing director. 'But we worry that the foreign fund
managers will start reorganising just when we have got everything going
properly.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Samaras targets centrist and rightwing voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a country where the leaders of both major political parties are in their
mid-70s, younger Greek politicians inevitably feel a sense of frustration,
writes Kerin Hope.
Mr Antonis Samaras, 42-year-old former foreign minister who brought down the
New Democracy government last week, is no exception.
Yet Mr Samaras, leader of Political Spring, a new party which hopes to
attract discontented centrist and rightwing voters in the October 10
election, may have got both his timing and his policies wrong.
One former cabinet minister said: 'All he had to do was be patient and the
New Democracy leadership would have dropped into his lap.'
As Greece's youngest foreign minister in memory, Mr Samaras was expected to
carry out instructions of Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime minister, and use
his charm to improve Greece's image with its European Community partners.
But Mr Samaras opposed the prime minister's policy of compromise over
recognising the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. He was sacked in
spring 1992 after proposing Greece close the border with Macedonia to
pressure it into changing its name.
The contradiction between Mr Samaras's efforts to present Political Spring
as the party that can rejuvenate Greek political life and his old-fashioned
nationalist views will not be lost on voters. Greek businessmen, anxious to
see the departure of the old political leaders wonder whether Mr Samaras, a
graduate of Harvard business school, can be serious about opposing the
government's privatisation policy.
Analysts expect Political Spring will win between up to six per cent of the
vote, enough to spoil Mr Mitsotakis's chances of returning to power.
Although Mr Samaras is likely to keep his parliamentary seat in Messenia in
southern Greece, he would be accused by conservatives of handing victory to
the socialists. As a result, his political future may be just as uncertain
as that of Mr Mitsotakis.

FT  13 SEP 93 / EC near deal on protection for bank deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers are poised to override German objections and strike a
deal today on a new Community-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme.
Agreement on the EC bank deposit directive would raise the level of minimum
protection to Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,240), paving the way for similar
arrangements to raise cover for investors in stocks and shares.
EC officials believe a qualified majority vote in favour of the bank deposit
scheme will be the most concrete result of today's meeting in Brussels.
Finance ministers will discuss the recent upheaval in the ERM over lunch,
but Brussels diplomats said no decisions are expected.
The new EC bank directive covers deposits in EC banks denominated in EC
currencies and Ecus. Member states would be free to oblige third-country
banks to join the scheme, marking a further step towards completing the
single European market.
Germany is expected to oppose the bank deposit guarantee proposals on the
grounds that a Community-wide approach could undermine its own scheme, which
offers virtually unlimited protection to account-holders in the event of a
bank defaulting.
Germany is worried that its own privately-managed scheme would be more
difficult to supervise if it has to accept members from third countries.
For the UK, the scheme would raise the level of protection. Under present
law, investors are offered 75 per cent protection on the first Ecu20,000 of
deposits but only on sterling deposits.
Under the latest proposals from the Belgian presidency, the EC would require
banks to raise protection to 90 per cent on the first Ecu20,000 with a
five-year transition period.
The directive does not specify whether member states should introduce a
public or private guarantee scheme. But it stipulates that banks must inform
depositors on the level of protection.
Finance ministers are today likely to give a cool reception to two European
Commission proposals aimed at boosting the EC's growth initiative. One would
allow the European Investment Bank to offer interest rate subsidies to
medium and small businesses, the other would permit up to Ecu5bn of
Community borrowing against future EC structural funds.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Brundtland heads for victory against odds: The reasons for
Norwegian PM's confidence over today's poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, today expects to pull
off a remarkable electoral feat.
Her Labour party, a minority government, is confident of returning to power
despite being out of step with most voters on the main political issue
facing the country - Norway's application to join the European Community.
To compound the conundrum, pro-EC Labour not only appears set to succeed,
but intends to rely for a parliamentary majority on the tacit support of two
of the country's staunchest anti-European Community parties.
This odd state of affairs suggests that the chance of Norway becoming an EC
member has receded as a result of the election. A poll late last week showed
a 54 per cent majority against membership, with support slipping to 29 per
cent. It also showed only a slim margin in favour among Labour's own
supporters.
But the pro-EC camp in Oslo, including the main opposition Conservative
party, has not abandoned the prospect of winning a referendum to decide the
issue, likely to be held within the next two years. From this point of view
the vital campaign to reverse Norway's narrow rejection of membership in
1972 will only start in earnest after today's election.
Certainly, neither Labour nor the Conservatives have made any attempt to
address the EC debate in the election campaign. On the contrary, they have
deliberately sought to avoid it, knowing that at this stage it is a
vote-loser.
Nevertheless, smaller parties which oppose Norwegian accession - for
economic reasons as well as fears of a loss of independence - have suffered
no such inhibitions. The two to which Labour will look for parliamentary
support, the Socialist Left party and the Centre party, have campaigned
almost exclusively on an anti-EC ticket and have boosted their standings in
the polls as a result.
The agrarian Centre party, which even wants to undo Norway's participation
in the European Economic Area agreement with the EC, looks set to double its
vote from the 6.5 per cent support it won in the 1989 election.
Labour, however, is unphased. Instead it has been encouraged by the way its
support as the biggest party has held up in the polls and even strengthened
in the latter stages of the campaign, while support for the Conservatives
weakened.
A poor performance by the Conservative leader Mrs Kaci Kullmann-Five - the
leader of the Centre party is also a woman, Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein  -
helped Labour. So too has an upturn in the oil-dependent economy.
Above all, Labour has the asset of Mrs Brundtland, who has achieved
commanding stature in Norwegian politics since she first became prime
minister in 1981.
Like Mrs Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the 1980s, she is not so much loved
as respected for her determination and her projection of Norway's interests
internationally.
There is now a common belief, even among her Conservative rivals, that she
is the only leader with a realistic prospect of persuading Norwegians to
accept EC membership.
The question is, can she turn around public opinion, which has consistently
hardened since she delivered Norway's application in April.
Assuming she wins today, the next step in the strategy is to negotiate an
accession agreement with Brussels which she can recommend as a good deal for
the country on the central matters of public concern - oil, fisheries,
agriculture and regional policy.
Only when, or if, that is accomplished will Mrs Brundtland set a date for
the promised referendum and begin to take the offensive in the membership
campaign.
Nevertheless, there are those both inside and outside the government who
think public opinion can be swayed. In their view, an acceptable accession
agreement may not prove as hard to win as has tended to be assumed.
On the sensitive question of fishing, Norway has agreed a series of cod
quota increases for EC vessels in Norwegian waters under the EEA agreement,
and diplomats say the Community is unlikely to seek further increases.
For Norway, there is also vital concern about North Sea oil.
Mrs Brundtland has warned that a proposed EC licensing directive, setting
out rules on open competition for exploration licences, would be seen as an
encroachment on Oslo's control over its most valuable resource and would
damage the image of the EC in the run-up to a referendum. She wants it
postponed and has won some support, notably from Germany and Denmark.
For the meantime, however, conventional wisdom says the odds remain against
Norwegian accession. Today's election is likely to reinforce that view.
However, for Mrs Brundtland and the other pro-EC forces, the real battle has
yet to be fought.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Brittan tests US resolve over Gatt
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BILZEN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will today test whether
the Clinton administration can offer new flexibility in the Gatt talks amid
signs that the French campaign to re-examine the Blair House farm trade
accord is making headway.
European Community foreign ministers are hoping that Sir Leon can persuade
his US counterparts to allow 'clarification' of certain aspects of the Blair
House agreement, while avoiding a formal renegotiation.
The delicate task of mollifying France while avoiding a further political
crisis within the Community dominated two days of informal talks in Bilzen,
east Belgium, which ended yesterday.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said France had
'psychological' difficulties with Blair House. He described French threats
to veto the draft US-EC farm trade accord as 'deadly serious'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said plans for an EC summit on
October 29 to celebrate ratification of the Maastricht treaty might fail if
the Community did not resolve internal disputes over the farm trade accord.
Sir Leon, who attended the Saturday session, will meet Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
Treasury secretary, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, on his US tour.
His most important talks are scheduled tomorrow, when he holds a one-to-one
session with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative.
Brussels officials said Sir Leon faced the tricky task of persuading Mr
Kantor of the mutual EC/US interest in securing a Gatt deal, while also
exploring whether the administration might be willing to risk the wrath of
US farmers and Congress by offering some concessions to the French on Blair
House.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, suggested that Sir Leon should
explore whether there was room for manoeuvre on the 21 per cent reduction in
the volume of subsidised exports, primarily by subtracting humanitarian food
aid, processed products and existing silo stocks from the list of cuts.
One idea being canvassed at the weekend meeting would be to add a separate
protocol or interpretation of Blair House. This might meet some of France's
reservations, while avoiding the charge that the Europeans wish formally to
reopen the draft accord.
Until recently, EC negotiators had hoped that the French were only bluffing
in their threat to veto Blair House and that negotiations on other parts of
the Gatt deal, such as market access, could proceed toward the mutually
agreed deadline of December 15. At that point France could consider Blair
House in the context of a comprehensive Gatt deal covering goods, services
and agriculture.

AN opinion poll published yesterday showed support for the ruling Labour
party holding steady at 34.8 per cent, while the main opposition
Conservative party weakened to 18.1 per cent from 22.2 in the 1989 general
election, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo.
Analysts say the importance of the Conservative party's strong defence
platform has dimmed in the eyes of an electorate no longer preoccupied with
defence and security issues. The anti-EC agrarian Centre party polled 16.1
per cent against a 6.5 per cent vote in 1989.
One of the most striking features of the poll is the plunge in support to
6.6 per cent for the populist right-wing Progress party, from 13 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Johan Joergen Holst, Norway's foreign minister and chief mediator in
secret Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, has boosted the Labour
party's standing ahead of already certain victory in today's general
election.
Heralded as a national hero for his contribution to the Middle East peace
agreement, Mr Holst yesterday campaigned before an enthusiastic crowd under
blue skies in Hoenefoss, a small town north-west of Oslo. He was accompanied
by his four-year-old son Edvard, who has also become a mini-hero in the eyes
of Norwegians who have listened as the father and son duo broadcast across
international airwaves almost continually in recent days as the story of
Oslo's role in the Middle East peace process unfolded.
Between signing autographs, Mr Holst called on the electorate to vote Labour
so the 'steady course' of his party's policies could be continued. 'This is
not the time for Norway to be subjected to the experimental policies of
other parties,' he warned.
According to a poll published yesterday, support for Labour is holding
steady at 34.8 per cent, while the main opposition Conservative party
weakened to 18.1 per cent from 22.2 in the 1989 general election.
Analysts say the importance of the Conservative party's strong defence
platform has dimmed in the eyes of an electorate no longer preoccupied with
defence and security issues.
The anti-EC agrarian Centre party, set to become the other victor in today's
election, polled 16.1 per cent against a 6.5 per cent vote in 1989,
indicating support from an electorate ever-resistant to EC membership.
One of the most striking features of yesterday's poll is the plunge in
support to 6.6 per cent for the populist right-wing Progress party, from 13
per cent in 1989. However, on Saturday in Oslo's main streets, Mr Carl
Hagen, the leader of Progress, drew a large crowd from the public who had
turned out to hear the last-minute pleas for support from the numerous
parties.
Standing on a wobbly folding table, an ever-confident Mr Hagen warned the
crowd that endorsing Labour's 'steady course' meant continued health queues,
record unemployment, and persistent rises in the budget deficit which would
have to be paid for by their children.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Paris plans income tax cuts and reforms
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE will make sweeping cuts in income tax in its 1994 budget and reform a
tax system that has been too complicated for too long, Budget Minister
Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
'We want to underpin demand,' Mr Sarkozy told TF1 television. 'What you do
not spend on taxes you will spend on consuming, and that is very good for
industry, and so very beneficial for jobs.'
He said there would be a cut averaging 3 per cent for 90 per cent of
taxpayers from January 1 1994. Fifty per cent of tax-payers will pay at
least 10 per cent less than last year.
The cost to the state will be FFr19bn-20bn (Pounds 2.16bn-Pounds 2.27bn), a
little more than the FFr17bn originally announced by Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur last month.
Mr Sarkozy, noting that France's tax system has not been reformed since
1959, said the number of tax brackets would be cut to seven from 13 to iron
out complexities.
He also criticised the current system for penalising those who increase
their earnings from one year to the next. 'How do you expect to stimulate
and encourage work?' he asked.

Germany's engineering workers will be calling for a wage rise next year
limited to the rate of inflation, plus any increase in productivity,
according to Mr Klaus Zwickel, acting leader of IG Metall, the country's

indication by the union of the need for wage restraint because of the
downturn in the German economy. But it still falls well short of the
employers' insistence on a 'zero round' in next year's most important wage
round.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Bonn nursing row is threat to coalition: Parties fall out
over who will pay for social security scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE STABILITY of Germany's ruling coalition was called into question this
weekend in a new row over how to finance the latest addition to the
country's generous social security system - nursing care for the elderly and
handicapped.
At the heart of the conflict is a fundamental difference on who should pay
most for the future scheme, workers or employers.
The Free Democratic Party (FDP), the minority partner in the government,
warned that a cross-party compromise between Chancellor's Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD)
could destroy the fragile basis of the coalition, a year before the next
elections.
The FDP says that any compromise which would put a greater financing burden
on employers now would be disastrous for the German economy and for the
competitiveness of German companies internationally. Such a deal would also
isolate the FDP and reinforce the trend towards a grand coalition between
the SPD and the CDU.
Leading members of the FDP reacted furiously at the weekend to moves by Mr
Norbert Blum, the labour minister, to reopen the whole question of financing
the nursing care scheme in talks with the SPD.
A first round of talks on Friday saw moves towards a compromise. Mr Rudolf
Dressler, social affairs spokesman for the SPD, said there was an agreement
to 'put on ice' the present proposal, which is bitterly opposed by the
German trade union movement. A second round of talks has been scheduled for
next Saturday, two days before the unions launch a national campaign to
block the proposal.
The present plan is backed by the FDP because it would ease the burden on
German employers, by reducing from three days to two the period they must
provide guaranteed sick pay for their workers.
An alternative solution under discussion would instead cancel two days from
the annual list of paid holidays given to German workers, though this is
likely to run into opposition from the third partner in the ruling
coalition, the Bavaria-based and staunchly Roman Catholic Christian Social
Union.
Mr Dieter-Julius Cronenberg, FDP deputy chairman of the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament, warned that, if the CDU and CSU sought compromises from
their partners, it would 'destroy the basis of trust for further
co-operation in the government'.
Mr Kohl is determined to push through the nursing care plan before the next
elections, not least because of its appeal to old voters. It would help
counter the negative impact of the government's cuts in social spending
which will come in next year - including cuts in both unemployment benefit
and social assistance.
The social cuts are under attack not only from the SPD and unions, but are
also set to be criticised by the 'social' wing of the CDU itself at its
annual conference in Berlin, which opens today.
Hopes that Germany's three main political parties would agree on a
presidential candidate will collapse today when the governing Christian
Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party nominate their
own candidates, Judy Dempsey writes from Berlin.
Mr Kohl will ask his CDU party conference in Berlin to endorse Mr Steffen
Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony. The choice
reflects Mr Kohl's determination to have as president an easterner, as well
as someone who reflects conservative values aimed at attracting the
hard-right wing of the CDU.
By contrast, the Social Democratic party will today endorse Mr Johannes Rau,
the current prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the coalition, has urged Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former foreign minister, to become its candidate. Mr
Genscher has refused but, if public opinion continues to swing in his
favour, may not take much more persuading to accept. Mr Kohl would not
welcome his former rival as a strong president.

FT  13 SEP 93 / France on list for Mercedes plant
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE was identified by Mercedes-Benz at the weekend as the fourth
short-listed production site for the German manufacturer's 200,000
units-a-year small car project. The others are the UK, the Czech Republic
and Germany itself.
The disclosure is certain to intensify rivalry among the short-listed
countries to attract the prestigious project.
In the UK 'there will be as many bids as there are local authorities that
know about it', said a government official. He suggested the project 'will
need development funding, so will have to go to a selective assistance
area'.
Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials in London would not
comment on what stage the assessment process had reached and what role the
DTI might be playing.
However, the Northern Development Corporation, whose area includes the
Nissan plant at Sunderland, said it had already responded to a DTI request
made last week for details of potentially suitable 250-300-acre sites in its
area. The west Midlands, Merseyside and north and south Wales are expected
to be among the front-runners in the UK for the project.
Welsh development agency officials were at the weekend shedding no light on
their involvement. However, they are likely to be encouraged in their own
bid for the venture by the recent rapid growth of the motor components
industry in Wales.

FT  13 SEP 93 / German health spending winding down: Insurance reforms are
working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Seehofer, Germany's federal health minister, bore a radiant face
when he recently announced that his six-month-old reforms had already
reversed the insidious trend of seemingly ever-higher health spending. His
smile was an achievement in itself for a man who has made enemies across the
German medical profession and pharmaceutical industry.
The state-subsidised health insurance scheme, which offers nearly full
health cover to 90 per cent of the population, reported a healthy surplus of
DM2.6bn (Pounds 1.04bn) for the period, after a DM9bn loss in 1992.
Per-member treatment-related spending has decreased by 2.7 per cent since
reforms took effect on January 1, after a 9 per cent increase last year.
Spending dropped as a result of severe budgetary restrictions under the
reforms for drugs and treatments. In answer to these, the medical profession
prescribed less than in previous years. 'We have succeeded in changing the
behaviour of everyone involved in the healthcare system,' Mr Seehofer said.
Some members of the medical profession welcome the change. 'A patient in
Germany would never leave his doctor without a prescription before,' says Mr
Frank Montgomery, from an independent association of doctors.'
But the reforms have also sparked bitter complaints from doctors and the
drugs industry. Both groups have seen their revenues decline as a result of
the ceilings on their fees and say the reforms could undermine the ability
of the system to continue to provide state-of-the-art drugs and treatments.
According to pharmaceutical associations, the budget ceilings are
threatening 20,000 jobs in pharmacies.
Dentists say they are increasingly refusing to treat non-privately insured
patients because lower fees do not cover costs.
To cap the rising spending borne by the insurance scheme, which is
compulsory only for those who earn less than DM6,000 a month, the reforms
introduced budgetary ceilings equal to 1991 levels of expenditure plus a
marginal increase reflecting the yearly average growth in personal income.
Heavy financial penalties are incurred if these ceilings are exceeded.
For drugs sold in pharmacies, spending covered by the health scheme has been
limited to DM24bn for the year. Physicians and dentists prescribing over
this limit are legally obliged to pay up to DM280m a year (estimated to be 1
per cent of annual doctors' fees) from their own pockets. Their medical
associations will be charged with examining individual cases of
over-prescribing and will impose fees to cover this amount. The
pharmaceutical industry must pay the costs of the next DM280m tranche of
over-spending to the insurance schemes.
For treatments, doctors and dentists' fees will be automatically reduced if
doctors over-prescribe, and hospitals will have to open credits to cover
over-spending rather than charge the insurance scheme.
The results of the reforms have been immediate. Prescriptions decreased
sharply in the first six months. Mr Seehofer hopes the insurance schemes
will save up to DM7bn this year in non-prescribed medicines and treatments.
However, retail sales in pharmacies have fallen by 21 per cent for the half
year, with pharmacists bitterly protesting. They say their profits could
fall by 32 per cent this year.
While doctors agree that the budgets for medicines are cutting excessive
over-prescriptions, they say the ceilings could undermine their own
budgeting. With declining profit margins, they fear that lack of investment
will undermine the quality of services.
'The reforms are purely monetary and do not address structural change,' says
Mr Montgomery. 'They are in fact destroying existing healthcare structures
without creating viable new ones.'
Dentists are angered by a series of fees reductions forced on them . These
include a 10 per cent price reduction on crown and bridge work, areas where
dentists earn most of their income.
Sales in the pharmaceutical industry fell by 11 per cent from January to
June. Moreover, the market share between original products and cheaper
generic medicines has changed to the detriment of companies investing in
research. Sales of generic medicines rose by 12 per cent in the six months.
Mr Walter Wenninger, head of the healthcare division of Bayer, predicts that
sales for pharmaceutical groups could drop by 25 per cent this year and says
the reforms clash with the government's aim of securing Germany as a
competitive industrial base.
The medical profession and the industry say further reforms are needed to
improve the structures of the healthcare system.
The medical profession also advocates greater participation by the patient
in the final health bill. German patients, accustomed to cheap healthcare,
must develop an awareness of its cost, they say.
Above all, they fear a victorious health minister will increase budgetary
restrictions next year or bring in new ones, further threatening incomes.

The move is seen as a clear indication by the union of the need for wage
restraint because of the downturn in the German economy. But it still falls
well short of the employers' insistence on a 'zero round' in next year's
most important wage round.
The first indication of the union's position - without any precise figures
for either its inflation or productivity estimates - was presented by Mr
Zwickel in Frankfurt as a 'peace offering' intended to take the heat out of
the coming pay talks. Formal wage demands have to be drawn up by the end of
November.
At the same time, he called for a joint initiative by both workers and
employers in the engineering industry, the sector of the German economy hit
hardest by the recession, to demand new government initiatives to counteract
rising unemployment, including an accelerated programme of infrastructural
investment in east Germany.
His plea met a sceptical response from Gesamtmetall, the engineering
employers' federation. A spokesman said the industry needed a freeze on
costs in the coming year. He said IG Metall still failed to recognise that
German wage costs were too high and undermined German competitiveness.

HOPES that Germany's three main political parties would agree on a
presidential candidate will collapse today when the governing Christian
Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party nominate their
own candidates.
But Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the outgoing president, said the dispute over
his successor, and the presidential office itself, was being used by the
political parties in the run-up to next year's federal elections.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will ask his CDU party conference in Berlin to
endorse Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of the eastern state of
Saxony. The choice of Mr Heitmann, 49, reflects Mr Kohl's determination to
have as president an easterner, as well as someone who reflects conservative
values aimed at attracting the hard-right wing of the CDU.
Mr Heitmann has repeatedly stressed the importance of the role of the
nation, security, and a return to traditional family values as a means of
consolidating unification. Mr Heitmann was active in the Lutheran church, a
focal point of the opposition under communist regimes, and is also seen by
Mr Kohl as a man who embodies resistance and integrity, as if to compensate
for the weak German resistance during the Nazi period.
By contrast, the Social Democratic party will today endorse Mr Johannes Rau,
the current prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Meanwhile, the Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the governing
coalition, has urged Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister,
to become its candidate. Mr Genscher has refused but, if public opinion
continues to swing in his favour, may not take much more persuading to
accept. Mr Kohl would not welcome his former rival as a strong president.
Opinion polls, carried out by the Ennid Institute, show that 56 per cent of
Germans support Mr Genscher, with 67 per cent in the east backing him. Only
5 per cent of Germans support Mr Heitmann. Mr Rau is supported by 26 per
cent of Germans, and but by only 14 per cent in the east.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: The shanty town fundamentalists -
Hamas and other groups will lead Palestinian objections to Arafat's pact
with Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   GAZA STRIP
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SEA of bobbing girls wearing white embroidered Jahabs - Islamic head
scarves - pours into the pot-holed, sewage-ridden streets of Khan Younis, a
dirty shanty town in the Gaza Strip. In the midday heat, beneath their blue
and white striped uniforms, the schoolgirls wear dark trousers down to their
ankles.
They are the only picturesque sight in the dreary and impoverished town, a
stronghold of Islamic fundamentalist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad
which reject peace with Israel and could violently threaten the peace
agreement to be signed in Washington today.
Although it is impossible to estimate accurately their strength, experts say
Islamic fundamentalists and supporters of other Palestinian organisations
which reject the agreement command support among about 40 per cent of Gaza's
780,000 residents. Their support in the West Bank is estimated at 20-25 per
cent.
Their emotional nationalistic rhetoric, appeal to Islamic conviction and
considerable potential for violence present the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, poised to take control of Gaza, with a formidable challenge.
Much will depend on how the PLO and, more important, Mr Yassir Arafat's
Fatah faction deal with the rejections on assuming power. Any crackdown on
Islamic fundamentalist dissent will raise the prospect of serious inter-
Palestinian conflict.
Graffiti staining almost all the walls of Khan Younis proclaims solidarity
with the martyrs of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon
and claims credit for the deaths of Israeli soldiers in the occupied
territories.
The residents of Khan Younis are also proud that theirs is the home town of
Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, the leader of the 415 Islamic activists deported
by Israel to Lebanon last December.
Over the years Gaza has become a deeply Islamic society. It is rare to see a
woman in the street who is not covered head to toe. Alcohol is strictly
prohibited. Smoking in public is frowned on. Most Gazans say they are proud
to live a life based on the strict principles of the Koran.
Of all the 'rejectionist groups' opposed to the peace agreement, the
strongest is the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, an acronym
which literally means zeal. Az a-Din al-Kassam, Hamas' poorly equipped
military wing, is named after a Palestinian martyr who launched a Jihad -
holy war - against British imperialism and Jewish settlement in Palestine in
the 1930s.
Hamas' charter calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state by armed
struggle, the liberation of the entire Islamic lands of Palestine and the
establishment of an Islamic state based on Sharia Koranic law.
Since the announcement of the peace agreement Hamas, a secretive underground
organisation, has strongly condemned the accord, saying it falls far short
of Palestinian demands for statehood, a right of return for Palestinian
refugees and control over occupied Arab east Jerusalem - site of the Dome of
the Rock mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine. Their leaflets accuse Mr
Arafat of 'conniving with the Zionist enemy in a conspiracy' against the
Palestinian people. They have mounted demonstrations across the West Bank
and Gaza Strip but so far they have ruled out violence against the PLO or
the possibility of civil war.
'The youth want to fight but it is not the policy of Hamas,' says a lecturer
at the Islamic University of Gaza. 'There will not be a civil war among
Palestinian because for now we accept dialogue and democracy. The leadership
will make the decisions according to Sharia and the soldiers of Hamas will
follow instructions.'
Hamas is waiting to see how the agreement will be implemented and received.
The Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine, closely aligned to Hamas, has gone
further. Mr Fatehi Shukaki, its exiled commander, said last week the accord
was 'against the Koran, against Islamic law. . . We will continue our
struggle through intifada (Palestinian uprising), through armed struggle and
through other means.' Other rejectionist groups have called for Mr Arafat's
head.
Hamas has been growing in strength over the past decade - thriving in Gaza's
impoverished refugee camps and among youths discontented with corruption in
the PLO exiled leadership and with lack of progress in the peace talks. At
first the organisation was tolerated by Israel as a counterweight to Fatah,
but was later banned and went underground.
It has drawn its greatest support from a programme of Islamic education and
welfare run by its social wing, the Islamic Society. This distributes alms
to the poor and runs nine kindergartens. Mr Mash Harawi, who works at the
Islamic society school in Nassir, is proud of the school's Islamic
programme.
'There is an Islamic solution to everything. The Koran is the message to man
to solve all his problems,' he says, standing in front of a painting which
shows the Koran rising above Mecca, Medina, the Dome of the Rock and a pile
of Bibles and Jewish Torahs.
Children learn reading, writing and Islam. Behind the school is an Islamic
court, equipped with a wooden gavel, where a panel of Islamic scholars,
lawyers and community leaders hear and resolve family problems and disputes
over inheritance and commerce.
Despite Hamas' welfare programme Fatah has kept political control, winning
large majorities in elections to professional associations. The only body
controlled by Hamas is the Islamic University association.
Many Hamas leaders know they have a lot to lose by confronting Fatah.
Without a strong Arab country behind them, it would be difficult to mount a
united challenge. They are also strongly wedded to the democratic principles
embedded in many Islamic fundamentalist movements.
Mr Abdul-Rahman Hamad, one of the most senior Fatah leaders in Gaza, says:
'We will not use force against Hamas and they will either lose their support
or participate in elections, which means they accept the agreement.'
If Mr Hamad is right Hamas, like the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt, could
emerge as an acceptable political party. However, if Fatah hardliners pursue
threats to repress Hamas, a violent backlash will be inevitable.
'If Fatah decides to act like the Algerian regime and suppress dissent there
will be violent conflict,' says Mr Martin Klaimer, an expert on Islamic
fundamentalism at Tel Aviv University. 'But the conditions are not there for
full-scale civil war. It will more likely take the form of clashes and
assassinations.'

FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: PLO suffers its worst split since
inception - Opposition is mounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE EVE of the signing of a historic accord with Israel, the Palestine
Liberation Organisation is suffering from the most serious split since its
inception.
Opposition to the agreement with Israel is mounting, both inside and outside
the PLO.
The opposition, which now includes more than 10 groups ranging from the
Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, to the leftist Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine DFLP and the Popular Front of Palestine (PFLP), is
seeking to form a broad alliance to thwart the accord.
The opposition has, however, pledged not to resort to violence against the
future Palestinian autonomy authority, although it has not decided yet if it
should form an alternative organisation challenging the legitimacy of the
PLO.
Over the last three weeks Messrs Mohammed Darish, an independent, Shafiq al
Hoot, PLO representative in Lebanon, Abdullah Hourani, an independent,
Taysir Khaled of the DFLP, and Abdul Rahmin-Malloul of the PFLP have
resigned from the PLO executive committee as demonstrations against Mr
Arafat continued in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.
As a result of the resignations the 18-member PLO executive committee is now
mainly confined to Fatah, the mainstream movement led by Mr Arafat, and the
Palestine People's party (the former communists), a group that has sizeable
influence in the Israeli occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
But even Fatah, which remains dominant inside and outside the occupied
territories, has been afflicted by divisions over peace with Israel. Three
of the co-founders of the movement, including the PLO foreign minister
Farouk Al Kadoumi, who has historically been closer to the left, and the two
brothers Khaled and Hani Al Hassan, who are ideologically associated with
the right, have publicly contested the terms of Mr Arafat's agreement with
Israel.
PLO executive committee member Suleiman Najab, who voted in favour of the
peace agreement last week, said yesterday he saw no need to rush into
signing it in Washington, as Mr Arafat has done.
'We should first secure Arab agreement and backing through an emergency
summit. This would be more in harmony with our pan-Arab commitments and with
agreements we have made with our Arab brothers,' he said in a statement.
'We should also have obtained the approval of the PLO central council before
signing it,' he added. The PLO plans to call a meeting of the 100-member
council to ratify the agreement after the signing ceremony in Washington.
Opposition within Fatah is particularly strong in Jordan and Lebanon, where
former fighters in the movement feel betrayed by the leadership commitment
to prevent acts of violence against the Israeli occupation forces.
According to Fatah sources, at least 180 former fighters - based in Jordan -
have refused to join the new Palestinian police force Mr Arafat is to form
as part of arrangements for the Palestinian autonomy.
'We are ready to serve in a nationalist police force in an independent
Palestinian state but not to be tools to suppress our people's resistance
against the Israeli occupation,' said a Fatah fighter, who has been a member
in the movement for the last 16 years, on condition of anonymity.
Such fears were cited by senior PLO officials who resigned from the top
level decision-making body.
'This agreement transforms the Palestinian autonomy authority into a
repression apparatus against our people in favour of Israel,' said Mr
Abdullah Hourani, the latest independent member to resign from the executive
committee, in reference to provisions in the limited autonomy concerning
security co-operation between Israel and the Palestinians.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: Hospitals fill up as protests hit
the streets - Tony Walker is among the wounded in fighting at Ramallah
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene in the emergency ward of Ramallah Hospital was like the worst days
of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule over the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Doctors and nurses worked feverishly to save the lives of badly-wounded
Palestinians, some of whom had been shot in the abdomen, in the chest, and
in the head.
The floor of the casualty station, all of whose beds and stretchers were
occupied, was awash with blood from those shot by Israeli soldiers seeking
to control demonstrations that had turned the centre of the Arab West Bank
town into a war zone.
At least two Palestinians died yesterday and scores were injured.
A day after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed mutual
recognition, the mood on the streets of Ramallah, other West Bank towns and
in the Gaza Strip was far from peaceful.
In Ramallah, on a sunny day, Palestinians associated with the Islamic
fundamentalist Hamas and the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine fought pitched battles with tough Israeli border police in streets
scarred by nearly six years of conflict since the intifada erupted in
December 1987.
The militant Palestinians also clashed in Ramallah and other places with
loyalists of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, who is under threat of
assassination after his momentous decision to conclude a peace deal with
Israel.
The Ramallah disturbances, in which youths threw rocks and broken bottles,
were one of the bloodiest demonstration on a day of violence in areas where
militants have their strongholds.
The violence was a warning of the enormous difficulties ahead in efforts to
convert agreements on paper into reality on the ground.
Opposition to the peace accord burns fiercely in the hearts of many
Palestinians, no less than it does among Israelis of the right and the
militant settler movement.
My own experience in Ramallah, when I was shot in the leg by what I believe
was a ricocheting live bullet fired by an Israeli soldier into a crowd of
Palestinian demonstrators, was a reminder of the sheer unpredictability of
events in the Middle East.
I had travelled from Jerusalem into the West Bank to sample opinion among
influential Palestinians, and on my way back to my hotel I had stopped
almost on a whim to observe the Ramallah demonstrations, which were
following a pattern familiar to those of us who had reported the intifada
from its earliest days.
Palestinian youths, some with their heads swathed in keffiyehs, were
throwing rocks towards Israeli soldiers, clad in riot gear and armed with
rifles and tear-gas launchers.
Suddenly, without warning, there was a fusillade of shots and observers of
the scene rushed for cover. It was at that moment that I felt a thud in my
leg, much as if I had been kicked by a mule.
Fortuitously, two young Palestinians, noticing my plight, helped me into the
back seat of a passing taxi which headed through the narrow, crowded streets
of the old Arab town towards a nearby hospital.
At the Ramallah Hospital, where I had gone several times before as an
observer during the early days of the intifada, I was greeted by chaotic
scenes as cars and ambulances disgorged the wounded into a tiny casualty
station, filled to overflowing.
While there, I saw at least one dead Palestinian carted away from the
emergency ward with mourning friends and relatives chanting 'Allahu Akhbar,
Allahu Akhbar' - 'God is great, God is great'.
My experience on Saturday was but a microcosm of what has been happening in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip for nearly six years, and looks set to continue
for the moment until things settle down, if they ever do.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: Pact bars Palestinian rule in Arab
east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE historic Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement to be signed at the White
House today provides for an interim five-year period of Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In addition Israeli troops will completely withdraw from Gaza and an
enclave, expected to be about 100 sq km, around the West Bank town of
Jericho, giving Palestinian authority in these two areas a fuller meaning.
Once the document, known as the 'Declaration of Principles' (DOP), is signed
in Washington, several more agreements and protocols will have to be
negotiated in the next three months to flesh out the agreement in such areas
as elections, policing and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The DOP will
come into force a month after signing.
The text of the DOP, however, makes blatantly clear that a 'Palestinian
interim self-government authority' will have no jurisdiction over occupied
Arab east Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Israeli nationals in the
occupied territories, and external security arrangements, foreign relations
and co-operation with neighbouring states during the interim period.
Negotiations on a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement based on United
Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 will begin 'as soon as
possible but not later than the beginning of the third year of the interim
period'. Permanent status negotiations will resolve all the outstanding
issues including Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements and
borders.
The first important protocol which will be negotiated after today's signing,
as stated in Annex Two of the DOP, will provide for the withdrawal of
Israeli Forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. The protocol should be
concluded and signed within three months. Upon the immediate signing of the
protocol 'Israel will implement an accelerated and scheduled withdrawal of
Israeli military forces. . .to be completed within a period not exceeding
four months.'
The protocol on withdrawal will include arrangement for:
A smooth transition;
The assumption of internal security and public order by the Palestinian
police force, consisting of police offices from within the territories and
those holding Jordanian or Egyptian passports;
A temporary international or foreign presence;
The establishment of a joint Palestinian-Israeli Co-ordination and
Co-operation Committee for mutual security purposes;
An economic development and stabilisation programme, including establishment
of an emergency fund to encourage foreign investment and financial and
economic support;
Safe passage of persons and transportation between the Gaza Strip and
Jericho;
Co-ordination for border passage between Gaza and Egypt, and Jericho and
Jordan.
Israeli forces will withdraw outside populated areas in the rest of the
territories by the eve of Palestinian elections.
Article III of the DOP on elections says direct, free and general elections
will be held for a Palestinian Council not later than nine months after the
DOP comes into force. Until the elections and the inauguration of the
council, Israel will transfer powers to 'authorised' Palestinians.
The powers transferred to Palestinians will be in education, culture,
health, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, and the Palestinian
authority will immediately start to build a Palestinian police force.
Article VII says an 'interim agreement' will specify the structure of the
council, the number of its members, the transfer of powers, and the extent
of the executive and legislative authority of the council and a Palestinian
judiciary.
To promote economic growth the council, upon inauguration, will immediately
establish a Palestinian electricity authority, a Gaza Sea port authority, a
Palestinian development bank, a Palestinian export promotion board, a
Palestinian environmental authority, a Palestinian land authority and a
Palestinian water administration authority.
After the inauguration of the council, the civil administration will be
dissolved and the Israeli military government will be withdrawn.
A second protocol, provided for in Annex I of the DOP, will have to signed
on the 'mode and conditions of elections'. The annex says Palestinians of
Jerusalem who live there will have the right to participate in the elections
process. It does not say whether they will be able to stand in elections - a
key PLO demand. The elections protocol will specify the system of elections;
agreed supervision and international observation.
Article X provides for a joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee to
ensure smooth implementation of the DOP and the resolution of disputes
between the two sides. Disputes which cannot be settled through the liaison
committee will be submitted to an agreed process of conciliation and
arbitration. Article XI provides for the immediate establishment of
Israeli-Palestinian economic co-operation committee. Article XII says Jordan
and Egypt will be invited to join joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison and
co-operation committees, including one to 'decide the modalities of
admission of persons displaced from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967'.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: EC will invite Arafat for talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC will today invite Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, to Brussels to discuss economic reconstruction in
the occupied territories as part of a wide-ranging political dialogue with
the PLO leader.
EC foreign ministers, meeting in eastern Belgium, also gave a warm welcome
to European Commission proposals to double assistance to the occupied
territories to Ecu500m (Pounds 383m) over the next five years.
The Commission is to invite Israeli and Palestinian experts to come
separately to Brussels to discuss how to bolster the economy of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank, and to use money to improve health, education and
infrastructure in the occupied territories.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, and Mr Willy Claes, Belgian
foreign minister who chairs the rotating EC presidency, will attend today's
ceremony in Washington to sign the peace agreement between Israel and the
PLO. The invitation to Mr Arafat is likely to be extended after the
Washington ceremony.
Mr Delors appealed to western countries to co-ordinate their aid effort and
warned against making loose promises of hundreds of millions of dollars
without proper assessment of the occupied territories' capacity to absorb
aid. 'We have seen what happened with Russia,' he said.
The elevation of Mr Arafat forms part of an unfolding EC diplomatic effort
aimed at responding to the Israeli-EC peace accord on mutual recognition and
self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.
Ministers yesterday approved a new mandate for the Commission to update a
1975 trade agreement with Israel, while holding out the prospect of aid to
other Arab countries such as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon once they complete
peace agreements with Israel.
The EC also wants an end to the Arab trade boycott of Israeli products, and
is likely to press Mr Arafat on this matter.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Lowest ranks take brunt of cuts in UK armed services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICERS have escaped largely unscathed from cuts in the UK armed forces
over the past decade, which have concentrated on the lowest ranks, according
to official figures.
The number of army privates and their equivalents in the navy and air force
fell by more than a quarter between 1980 and 1992. Officer numbers fell by
just 1.6 per cent over the same period. The number of colonels and
lieutenant-colonels rose.
Overall, the strength of the armed services fell by 36,891 between 1980 and
1992. But nine out of 10 of those were privates; the number of commissioned
officers fell by just 630.
The number of officers at the rank of major-general and above fell by 21 per
cent, but the reductions in the number of other officers were small by
comparison.
A similar pattern can be seen among the 87,900 white-collar civilian staff
employed by the Ministry of Defence. Their numbers have fallen by a quarter
since 1980, but there has been no reduction in the number of middle and
senior managers.
The distribution of cuts was described as 'surprising' by Professor Paul
Rogers, a defence expert at Bradford University.
Under the last Labour government, there were substantial cuts at all ranks
of officers. Between 1975 and 1980, the number of servicemen to each officer
rose from 6.26 to 6.71.
Since 1980, however, the number of servicemen per officer has fallen. After
14 years of Conservative government, there are now 5.89 servicemen to each
officer.
Over the same period, officers' pay rose by more than 170 per cent, while
the pay of privates rose 138 per cent. A general now typically earns almost
nine times the pay of a private, compared with seven times in 1980.
The policy of getting rid of privates rather than officers, combined with
widening pay differentials, has reduced the savings from manpower cuts. The
proportion of the defence budget spent on pay rose from 36 per cent in 1985
to almost 42 per cent this year, while the proportion spent on equipment has
fallen.
Dr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said the UK needed 'more
ordinary squaddies for deployment on peacekeeping duties in places like
Bosnia'. Officers found it all too easy to fill discharge lists with other
ranks, he said.

FT  13 SEP 93 / US pledges key role in push for wider settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US promised to take a central political, financial and even military
role in efforts to sustain the momentum for a wider Middle East peace
yesterday on the eve of the accord between Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organisation.
At 11am today, Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, will stand together on the White House south lawn
to witness signature of an outline agreement giving Palestinians limited
self-rule in the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.
A short text, the fruit of months of secret negotiations in Norway, is
intended to mark the end of one of the 20th century's most bitter conflicts.
It will be signed by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and Mr
Abu Mazen, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official, before 2,500
distinguished guests.
The hour-long ceremony offers the prospect of Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin, sworn
foes for decades, endorsing the peace with a symbolic handshake.
Mr Arafat, who flew into Washington last night for his first visit to the US
since he brandished both a gun and an olive branch at the United Nations in
1974, is expected to forsake his customary military fatigues and pistol and
don a suit.
The ceremony will cap an extraordinary two weeks which began when Israel and
the PLO surprised the world by announcing they were on the verge of an
agreement on mutual recognition and limited Palestinian autonomy. In a
series of statements yesterday, the Clinton administration strove to
maintain efforts for a wider peace with undertakings designed to accelerate
agreement between Israel and its other Arab neighbours - Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon.
In an interview with the New York Times, President Bill Clinton assured
Israel that the peace accord with the PLO would not herald cuts in billions
of dollars of aid and military assistance. Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, also said that the US was prepared to offer troops to
guarantee security in the Golan Heights after any negotiated Israeli
withdrawal.
But Mr Clinton and Mr Al Gore, his vice-president, also stressed that while
the US was prepared to offer financial aid to support peace in the region,
it did not see itself as the main provider. 'We stand ready to do our part,'
Mr Gore said on NBC television. 'But we're not speaking of anything
comparable to previous agreements where the US was the sole guarantor.'
Mr Clinton echoed the point when he announced that he had won an undertaking
from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, for a strong Saudi-led aid package
from the Gulf states - whose relations with the Palestinians were deeply
soured by the PLO's pro-Iraqi stand in the Gulf war. Mr Clinton quoted the
king as saying: 'You take the lead in organising it, and tell us what we are
supposed to do.'
The president also said he had elicited approval for the PLO-Israeli deal
from President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, who had hitherto refrained
from any direct comment on the agreement. Quoting also from a recent
30-minute conversation with Mr Assad, Mr Clinton said the Syrian leader
said: 'It is a positive thing, this agreement, for all of us.'
Mr Clinton said Mr Assad explicity called on the US to play a continuing and
central role in mediating an agreement between Israel and Syria, which
hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for a
Syrian declaration of 'full peace' with Tel Aviv.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Viacom to take over Paramount for Dollars 8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIACOM International, the fast-expanding US cable television group, is to
buy Paramount Communications, the entertainment and publishing company, for
Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.32bn) in the biggest US media takeover since the
1989 marriage of Time and Warner Communications.
The two New York-based companies announced the agreed cash-and-shares deal
yesterday after several days of market speculation.
Viacom is a diversified media company best known for its cable television
channels, which include MTV, the pioneering pop music video channel, and
Nickelodeon, which runs programmes for children. It also owns cable
television distribution systems.
The substantially larger Paramount is best known for its Paramount Pictures
film studio and its Paramount theme parks. Its assets also include the book
publishers Prentice Hall and Simon &amp; Schuster, and Madison Square Garden,
the New York sports arena.
The deal is part of a merger trend among US media companies as the industry
tries to take advantage of the convergence of television and film
entertainment, publishing, telecommunications and computers.
The deal should allow the new company, to be called Paramount Viacom
International, to compete more effectively around the globe with giants such
as America's Time Warner and Capital Cities/ABC and Japan's Sony.
Paramount's film production, for example, can be distributed over Viacom's
cable network.
Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, will become chairman of the new
company, and Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, will be chief
executive.
Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, and Mr Stanley Jaffe, president
of Paramount, will join them in leading a transition team 'to manage the
combined operations'. The deal is expected to be completed in late 1993 or
early 1994.
The merger terms call for Viacom to pay Paramount shareholders Dollars 69.14
a share. Paramount shares closed on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at
Dollars 61 1/8, up Dollars 4 1/4. Viacom's class A voting stock closed at
Dollars 66 and its non-voting B stock at Dollars 59 3/8 on the American
Stock Exchange.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Violence flares on eve of Mideast peace agreement: Eight die
in clashes as Israel and PLO prepare to sign accord in Washington today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA STRIP
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLOODY clashes erupted in the Gaza Strip and Israel yesterday as
Palestinians opposing the historic peace agreement, due to be signed today
in Washington, stepped up their violent protests.
At least eight people died in one of the worst days of Arab-Israeli clashes
in recent years as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO leader, flew to the US to witness the signing of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
The violence has exposed the deep divisions among Palestinians inside the
occupied territories and within the PLO itself over the agreement, which may
threaten the stability of the rapidly unfolding peace process.
Hours before Mr Rabin left Jerusalem, three Israeli soldiers were shot dead
in Gaza by Islamic fundamentalists opposed to peace with Israel.
The military wing of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, which has vowed
to keep up the armed struggle against 'Zionists', claimed responsibility for
the ambush on an army jeep, in which the attackers fled with two rifles.
Scores of heavily armed border police and soldiers barricaded roads and
sealed off areas of Gaza city yesterday during a fruitless hunt for the
killers.
In other incidents in Gaza, three rejectionist Arabs were killed, bringing
the weekend Palestinian death toll to at least five after demonstrations
across the territories in favour as well as against the peace deal.
In Israel, an Arab stabbed to death an Israeli bus driver and was then shot
dead by a soldier on a bus travelling between Ashdod and Ashkelon.
Unrest in the territories has been ignited by angry denunciations from
Palestinian factions abroad and by resignations from the Palestine
Liberation Organisation. Ten Damascus-based Palestinian factions, including
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the leftist Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, have vowed to sabotage the accord.
The fundamentalist Islamic Holy War-Jerusalem said yesterday it was quitting
the PLO's parliament-in-exile and the 100-member Central Council, the first
faction to withdraw formally from the institutions.
Iranian-backed fundamentalist groups in the territories and in Lebanon have
joined secular political organisations in denouncing the agreement and
trying to forge a broad front against it.
The opposition has, however, pledged not to battle against Palestinians but
to intensify the onslaught against Israelis.
In Ramallah, on the west Bank, Israeli soldiers shot dead two PFLP
supporters protesting against the agreement.
Rejectionist Palestinians say the peace agreement falls far short of
Palestinian demands for an independent state, control over occupied Arab
east Jerusalem and the right of return of thousands of Palestinians exiled
during the 46-year Arab-Israeli conflict. They have called for a general
strike throughout the occupied territories today to protest against the
signing ceremony.
As Mr Arafat left north Africa, his moderate Fatah group was under severe
criticism from hardline Arab groups, but he defended the accord as a step on
the road to the establishment of a Palestinian state.

FT  13 SEP 93 / Bus drivers find route to fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SELECT group of bus drivers will make a profit of more than Pounds 100,000
each through the forthcoming flotation of Badgerline Group, the Avon-based
company that has grown into one of the UK's biggest providers of local bus
services.
The company, which operates 2,300 buses and coaches in Midlands, south Wales
and the south of England, will be floated on the stock market in November
with an estimated value of Pounds 100m.
The original 80 employees who took shares seven years ago when the company
was created by a management led buy-out, have seen the value of their stake
increase nearly a hundredfold. They will gain even more when the terms of
the flotation are finalised, while some modestly paid middle managers will
have shares worth more than Pounds 200,000.
The company set out on its route to fortune in 1986 when a group of managers
and employees succeeded with a Pounds 3m buy-out of Badgerline, the third of
the National Bus Company's subsidiaries to be sold in the government's
privatisation programme.
A report by the National Audit Office said that one in four of the
state-owned bus companies was sold for less than the value of its vehicles
and properties.
The price paid in the Badgerline buy-out, completed before deregulation of
bus services, reflected the 'reasonable commercial risk' involved, said Mr
Trevor Smallwood, its chairman.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Recession in Europe limits sales: Trade position benefits
from cheaper pound; Import values decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION IN continental Europe lies behind the flatness of UK exports since
the beginning of the year, economists said yesterday.
The value of exports in the second quarter was Pounds 29.1bn, 2 per cent
lower than in the first quarter when exports amounted to Pounds 29.6bn.
Import values fell by about the same amount, from Pounds 33.1bn to Pounds
32.4bn.
This took the whole-world deficit to Pounds 3.3bn, slightly narrower than in
the previous quarter when it was Pounds 3.5bn, but wider than in the same
quarter a year ago when the gap was Pounds 2.96bn.
Volume figures showed that the UK's trade position is benefiting from the
cheaper pound. Export growth has outpaced that of imports since the start of
the year. The volume of imports has fallen by 5 per cent in the first
quarter and 3 per cent in the second. Export volumes, which fell in the
first quarter, rose 1 per cent in the second.
Terms of trade figures showed that imports were less competitive in the
second quarter, compared with exports, which could explain why the UK is
apparently substituting UK goods for foreign imports. The Central
Statistical Office said that non-oil terms of trade - export prices relative
to import prices - were the lowest on record.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Arab governments remain impassive over
accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB governments still negotiating their own peace agreements with Israel
remained impassive yesterday at the Jewish state's historic recognition of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
It was left to Egypt, which has enjoyed a cool peace with Israel since 1979,
to embrace the move as a 'positive step'.
Jordan, which expressed umbrage at not having been consulted about secret
PLO-Israeli talks leading up to the deal, adopted a similar tone yesterday.
'Jordan does not have details and has not been consulted on the mutual
recognition,' said Mr Ma'an Abu Nowar, the information minister, 'so I
cannot make a response and join in the jollifications and happiness and
wondrousness.'
Syria, which felt similar hurt at having been taken off guard by the PLO,
remained officially silent. It has yet to make any detailed response either
to the outline agreement between the PLO and Israel on self-rule.
The Lebanese government also withheld comment, although the foreign ministry
repeated its doubts over how the self-rule agreement would affect the tens
of thousands of Palestinian refugees living in the country.
The three governments' silences, even granted the fact that Friday is a holy
rest day in the Islamic world, serves as a reminder that much remains to be
negotiated with Israel before the region can be said to be on the threshold
of a full and comprehensive peace.
Only Jordanian negotiators at the Washington peace talks, which formally
ended this week, have indicated that they could be ready to sign their own
outline 'agenda' with Israel by next week, although Mr Abu Nowar yesterday
also cast doubt on that.
Responding to comments by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister,
that Israel and Jordan could sign a deal soon after the PLO-Israeli signing
on Monday, he said only; 'That's a bit optimisitic, shall we say. We haven't
heard any reports to that effect from our negotiators.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Trade gap narrows as competitiveness of UK goods grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPROVED competitiveness of UK goods, following the devaluation of
sterling a year ago, helped narrow the trade gap in the second quarter.
World trade figures show that in the three months to June the UK imported
Pounds 3.3bn more than it exported, a slightly narrower deficit than in the
previous quarter when the gap was Pounds 3.5bn, revised from Pounds 4.5bn.
Although the quarterly deficit remains high, the latest figures contain
encouraging trends. Measured by volume, imports have fallen sharply since
the start of the year, while export volumes remained about flat.
This raises the possibility that the UK is substituting goods made
domestically for imports. It also reflects the continued weakness of
domestic demand, which has limited import penetration.
The news is encouraging, as it suggests the economic recovery will be able
to progress without a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments.
The volume of total imports excluding oil and erratic items - defined as
ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver - fell by 3 per cent in the
latest quarter, compared with a 5 per cent fall in the first quarter.
On the same basis, exports rose by 1 per cent in the second quarter,
following a 3 per cent decline in the first quarter. The Central Statistical
Office has yet to provide a breakdown of imports and exports by commodity,
so it is not clear where import substitution is taking place.
While the figures are encouraging, the improvement in UK trade has been
confined to countries outside the European Community, which account for less
than half of total UK trade.
The visible trade deficit with the EC doubled from Pounds 400m in the first
three months of the year to Pounds 800m in the second quarter, reflecting
the economic sluggishness afflicting the UK's European trading partners.
By contrast, the deficit with non-EC countries narrowed. It was Pounds
2.36bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.1bn in the first.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Private View: Work for all, the Prof proclaims - Christopher
Freeman gives union leaders and governments the benefit of his research on
the effects of technology on employment, spread the reduction in volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WOULD not have guessed it from the dreary intonation of prepared
speeches at the TUC Congress in Brighton this week, but trade union leaders
are finally facing what their former colleague Clive Jenkins called 'the
collapse of work'.
The TUC's new general secretary, John Monks, addressed the problem on
Wednesday, as did the European Community's social affairs commissioner,
Padraig Flynn, on Monday.
What is the problem? Demand for labour in western Europe has fallen sharply
while the sweatshops of Asia are working overtime. Meanwhile the
micro-electronic revolution is rapidly chipping away at the way in which
work is organised and jobs are distributed. In Britain that has been
accompanied by wage cuts, de-recognition of unions, erosion of worker
protection and widespread subcontracting of labour - sometimes in the
crudest fashion.
It must appear to union leaders as if jobs - what they call 'real' jobs -
are simply drying up.
To discover whether this is true I consulted Professor Christopher Freeman,
who is 72 today and who has spent half his lifetime studying the
relationship of technology to employment. Earlier this year his research was
recognised by an international jury of social scientists in Paris who made
him the first winner of the Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 64,935) Prix
International du Futuroscope. He already has the Bernal Prize and the
Schumpeter Prize.
Freeman, co-founder and former director of the Science Policy Research Unit
at Sussex University, lives in Lewes, a few miles from the TUC conference
hall. We met over lunch in a Thai restaurant to the accompaniment of a
plaintive Chinese pop song.
I asked him whether we had reached some kind of watershed. Freeman agreed
that in some respects the situation was completely new. 'Nevertheless', he
added, 'I would think - and hope - that economic theory can't be completely
wrong in saying that if you have enough aggregate demand in the economy that
it will, with some lags and rigidities, be translated at some point into
useful employment, even if it's a different kind of employment.
'Technical change has led to a tremendous reduction in the number of working
hours needed to sustain a reasonable living standard. The problem for
economic policy is to spread that reduction in the volume of labour
reasonably widely over the whole active population and not to concentrate it
on a few regions, a few people.'
Freeman calls this 'the active society'. (Commissioner Flynn used the same
phrase in his speech to the unions.) 'But the hours of work need to be very,
very flexible. And I think that's possible now. One of the big advances
information technology has brought us is that you can vary your hours
without great trouble.'
Human's psychological need for work had been demonstrated by studies of
prisoners of war. Without it, it has been found, they went to pieces. 'So I
think what you need now is a society where there is work available for
everyone who wants to do it.'
Technology might disrupt old patterns of employment: for some that spells
insecurity, others liberty. But it could free people for labour-intensive
occupations - looking after other people, or creative work. Freeman says:
'Those occupations should increase as the boring, less skilled jobs get
eliminated. And craft occupations should increase.
'In that sense, it could - I'm not saying it will - lead in some sense to a
better society. Could. It probably won't, but . . .' The professor broke off
with an apologetic laugh.
I suggested companies would resist job-sharing and similar devices for
spreading work.
'There are some employers who would like to behave in the way you are
describing, and who are behaving in that way. There will be tendencies to go
back - you can see it in the debate on the social chapter (of Maastricht) -
to low-wage types of occupation, even sweatshops.
'Some will try and get through as they have done in each recession by
reducing labour forces and wages if possible . . .I think there are more
attempts to reduce wages now than before the second world war.
'The evidence for a pessimistic scenario is there in the fact that the UK
government has taken this, I think, very retrograde stance on the social
chapter. But the reason I think the scenario might be wrong is that there's
also a lot of evidence that you get very low morale in those situations, and
that good teamwork and reasonably good conditions in the end yield better
productivity and certainly better implementation of new technology.'
I asked whether Europe had any choice but to compete with Asia - or east
Europe - on the same terms of low labour costs and high technology input.
'There is this strong school of thought which says wage flexibility is the
main problem,' he replied. 'But there are two kinds of flexibility. The one
most economists talk about is cost-price flexibility, meaning wage cuts and
a reduction in social benefits - the big topic in western Europe. The other
kind, which I think in the end is more efficient, is flexibility in work
organisation, in technology, where you really learn to use new techniques
and teamwork efficiently. It goes back to Robert Owen, this debate.'
Is full employment still a realistic goal for a government?
'I think it is, but as I said earlier a better name for it is an active
society, because of the importance of women's employment, part-time
employment, old people's employment . . .' He laughed at the self-reference.
'It could in some ways be better than the old one in that some parents - I'm
certainly one of them - would certainly have liked as males to have more
time to look after children at various times in our lives. We couldn't do
that with the old structure. I think we should be able to do it.'
Freeman is a mild man who wears his honours lightly. He likes watching sport
and birds. He is a suppressed 'twitcher', he says, and spent most of his
Easter weekend chasing a hoopoe. He is also, privately, an idealist capable
of surprising vehemence. He described himself, startlingly, as a
'neo-communist'.
We had been discussing whether economics could be neutral, or 'value-free'.
Freeman said that nobody, not even economists, could live without goals,
beliefs and ethics.
The world's complexities could be analysed in two ways: with abstract
techniques like the mathematics of chaos theory, or by giving oneself time
to think, to apply ethics and social values to the phenomena.
'Some people call that technology assessment, or cost-benefit analysis. I
certainly think there's a function for philosophers, if you like, people who
are concerned with the quality of life in general, including environmental
issues and the question of speed of work.'
He quoted T S Eliot: 'Where is the life we have lost in living? Where is the
wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in
information?'
When economists disagree, I asked, is that due to ethical prejudices, or
because they can't agree on the numbers?
'It's more likely to be their political prejudices than their ethics. Very
often they'll want the same thing but they'll disagree about the path to
achieve it. Ideology is still very strong in the social sciences because
it's so hard to do what the physical scientists do and replicate
experiments.'
Do you consider yourself a social scientist?
'Well, I've always hesitated to use the term 'scientist' in relation to
economics or politics. In English at least it sounds a bit pretentious
because the possibilities for coming to conclusions from experimental
evidence are less.'
What are your ideological prejudices?
'Probably other people can discern it better than I can. I'm certainly aware
of a few, yes.'
How would you describe them?
'I'd say I was a neo-liberal with a small 'l' and a neo-communist with a
small 'c'.'
What's a neo-communist?
'It means that I think inequalities in the world, between the third world
and the rich world are obscene and should be reduced. They are also obscene
within the rich countries - and I think they are getting worse almost
everywhere.'
Doesn't that make you a dangerous Leftie?
'No, no, a lot of Conservative economists are quite in favour of income
redistribution.'
Are the inequalities also inefficient in economic terms?
'I think they are, yes. Japanese companies pay their managers about
one-tenth what American managers get in the same industry and I don't think
they suffer. What the American big companies pay their executives and
directors is way out of line . . . economically absurd as well as morally
obscene.'
Also in Britain?
'I think so, yes.'
Freeman's two sons work in computer software, a promising field 15 years ago
but whose future, their father says, looks less rosy now. Can an economist
advise his children what to do?
'I doubt it very much,' he laughed. 'I don't think anyone's very good at
long-term forecasting. With commonsense you can see some trends but if I was
advising my youngest daughter, I probably wouldn't say.'
He has two boys and two girls from his first wife, Peggitty, who died 20
years ago and a 17-year-old daughter from his second wife, Margaret.
I asked him what he would do with the Dollars 100,000 French prize.
Freeman said some he would give some to his children and to his brother who
suffers from Alzheimer's disease. 'Especially I'll try and help my youngest
daughter, see her right . . . to help her get whatever's going in the way of
employment.' The laugh this time could so easily have been ironic. It
wasn't.
