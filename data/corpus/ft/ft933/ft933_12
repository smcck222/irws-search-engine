FT  11 SEP 93 / Despatches: The navy lark - Christina Lamb on the
aspirations of Bolivia's landlocked sailors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPTAIN Luis Aranda is the proud commander of the fleet of the fourth base
of the Bolivian navy. But the only ships at his command are those he makes
at home from matchsticks, along with a motley flotilla of five small metal
ferry and patrol boats that are gently rusting in the waters of Lake
Titicaca. Aranda's 150-strong division spends most of its time raising
chickens and cultivating prize tomatoes. The reason: Bolivia may have a
navy, but it has no sea.
Bolivia has been landlocked since losing the War of the Pacific against
Chile in 1879. From the moment one arrives in the Andean city of La Paz it
is evident that neither the rarified air nor the passage of years have
served to quell passions; indeed, the issue is a national obsession.
A plaque at the airport asserts that Bolivia is a maritime nation.
Bright-coloured stickers in taxicab windows scream 'The Sea Belongs to Us -
To Recapture it is Our Duty.' Newspaper editorials rail almost daily at
Chile's mulishness in refusing to relinquish the land that blocks Bolivia
from the Pacific coast.
El Mar Boliviano is a primary school set-textbook crammed with pictures of
crashing waves described as 'our sea.' Statues in otherwise peaceful town
centres depict demonic Bolivians bayoneting hapless Chileans above the
inscription: 'What once was ours will again be.'
'We're the only landlocked nation in the world', is a frequent complaint
from locals, blaming Bolivia's glaring poverty on its lack of coastline.
They will not listen if one points out other examples of sea-less nations
such as Switzerland, Austria, Paraguay.
Bolivia is certainly one of the world's most unfortunate or misguided
nations. Once the second largest country in Latin America, it has lost
territory to almost all its neighbours in wars. But it is the loss of the
sea that really rankles. At every international conference Bolivia raises
the issue, demanding its land back, and Chile always says No. On March 23
every year a Day of the Sea is held to mourn the loss, and 30 years ago the
navy was re-established to show that Bolivia would never yield.
A smart 10-storey building was recently constructed to house the high
command of the 8,000-strong navy and its two-ship fleet. On the top floor
sits the commander-in-chief himself, Admiral Miguel Alvarez. Surrounded by
pictures of ships on the high seas, he booms: 'The sea is in the soul,
spirit and heart of every Bolivian. Everyone.'
Admiral Alvarez believes that with the end of the cold war it is time to
solve territorial disputes such as that between Bolivia and Chile. 'We have
great hopes from the new world order and will raise this issue at every
forum until we get a satisfactory resolution reintegrating the land which,
by historic, geographic and legal right, belongs to this country.'
He thinks Britain should take a lead in this process, claiming that British
merchants in Chile, seeing the value of nitrates in Bolivia, inspired and
funded the Chilean invasion of the Bolivian port of Antofagasta. Apparently,
during Queen Victoria's reign, maps of the region were printed in Britain
omitting Bolivia altogether - clear proof of conspiracy.
In the meantime, as he waits for Britain to get its act together, the
admiral sees nothing incongruous about being commander-in-chief of a navy
which has no sea. He admits a certain envy for neighbouring maritime nations
such as Argentina, Peru and Brazil, on whose charity he relies to allow his
forces to practise. If they are lucky, Bolivian naval cadets go to sea once
a year.
Out at the fourth naval base of Tiquina on Lake Titicaca, Capt Aranda says
his men are ready to take to the high seas at any time.
While they are waiting for the great day, the Bolivian navy is giving a
useful lesson to the rest of the world in how to utilise an idle military.
Capt Aranda's men patrol the lake looking for Sendero Luminoso guerrillas in
hiding from Peru, and his colleagues in the Amazonian naval bases chase
narco-traffickers.
But most of the time the men of the fourth base are engaged in raising
chickens, growing vegetables and planting trees to replace those removed by
locals. 'Perhaps you might think it a little strange to see a navy growing
vegetables', says the captain as he shows off a splendid selection of
lettuces and tomatoes, 'but armed forces should adapt to the necessities of
the situation. It's our duty to contribute to the development as well as the
defence of the country.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: A nice place to live
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I READ so many novels that in a palpable sense it is fiction that has made
me what I am: tolerant, generous, civilised, kind, a humanist and a liberal.
A flinty sort of liberal, though, nothing mimsy mamsy: for example,
anti-authoritarian but also in favour of capital punishment, which is not, I
believe, a common or garden coupling.
Some novels are better than others, but that is true of everything. This is
often, as it happens, the extent of my literary criticism, for I am not a
natural critic.
Yet I enjoy a book of criticism, especially when it is as spiky as After the
War: The Novel and England Since 1945, by DJ Taylor, which will be published
on Monday. We are not talking blockbuster. But in the week before the Booker
Prize shortlist is announced, After the War deserves to sell a few copies,
if only to see what the author makes of his assertion that the modern
English novel - never call it British - is 'an art-form which nearly
everybody admits is in a wretched state, and in which large numbers of
intelligent people have lost interest'.
His mission is to set the post-war English novel in its social context.
Apparently this is known as English literary sociology, which is not as dire
as at first it sounds.
To show you what the author means, let us peek into his best chapter,
entitled The Literary Consequences of Mrs Thatcher. Taylor is not blaming
Margaret Hilda for the death of the English novel. Instead, he is asking why
the 1980s - a decade of schism and drama - marked a further decline in the
conventionally framed political novel.
One of the side-effects of Thatcher's long reign, says Taylor, was the
pressure placed on writers to take up positions on either side of the
barricade, however embarrassing or pointless the result. Yet the death of
British democracy - Maurice Edelman called Britain 'a kind of Venetian
oligarchy' - and the impenetrable aura of secrecy increasingly in evidence
during the Thatcher years had given politicians generally a phantasmagoric
quality, with Thatcher herself the 'chief monster in an elaborate
demonology'.
This was not a good thing for the political novel. Says Taylor: 'Taking its
lead from political satire of the Yes, Minister variety, the straightforward
political novel has degenerated into a kind of burlesque, dominated by a
single gargantuan monster. The fictive Mrs Thatcher . . . is no more than a
caricature. Even a really subtle and imaginative spoof like Mark Lawson's
Bloody Margaret (1991) . . . can only invest her with a . . . blurred
remoteness.'
Nevertheless, the late 1980s, he says, were remarkable for the unanimity
among writers, and for the existence of a literary opposition more vocal and
coherent than at any time since the 1930s. And if a single factor
distinguished the literary response to Margaret Thatcher it was
'incomprehension, or rather a refusal to comprehend. The fact that millions
of people had repeatedly voted for her seemed of little moment to a handful
of left-leaning liberals whose favourite riposte was to regret Mrs
Thatcher's 'vulgarity''.
There was the Thatcherite fictional hero, of course - male, middle-class,
suburbanite, self-sufficient, go-getting, entrepreneurial: a distinctive
animal with recognisable social and psychological characteristics.
But what formed the basis for a great many doubtful state-of-the-nation
novels in the 1980s, Taylor maintains, was a handful of catchphrases. 'The
novelists of the 1980s, you feel, did their 'research' in the cuttings
libraries of national newspapers: their 'observation' was of headlines and
government statistics, their conclusions could be found in leader-page
articles in The Guardian.'
In his introduction, Taylor says that writers are told repeatedly that truly
intelligent people today become stockbrokers or video producers, and regard
novel-writing as an antiquated hobby.
He is an excellent critic. But I'm not sure he is right. Although I have
read only a fraction of the novels he has read, I suspect that the late-20th
century novel, in Britain and elsewhere, is a lot less raggle-taggled than
people like him believe.
I like modern fiction. It is a nice place to live. In the age of John Major
it is the only place to live.
After The War, Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 17.99.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Missing out on my own mugging: Michael Holman feels uneasy
after an encounter with would-be thieves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU CAN stop shaking now.'
He looked about 12 years of age with a bright, alert face. A few minutes
earlier he - or at least his teenage companions - had been about to mug me.
He briefly took hold of my right arm, as if to steady me, a tender,
incongruous gesture of concern. I looked down at him, dressed in
loose-fitting baseball jacket, jeans and trainers.
I did not want to tell him the truth about my condition. I probably looked
bemused. He gave a little tug at my sleeve.
'You can stop shaking, honest. We aren't gonna hurt you.'
'I can't - that's the problem, that's what the illness does to me.'
He looked perplexed. This was not how he wanted our encounter to end. The
rest of the gang were moving on. He frowned, then his face cleared: 'Don't
worry mate, you're safe now.' And they went on their way.
I had first noticed the gang roaming the passages at Liverpool Street
Underground station when I was waiting for a Tube at about 11pm. I took care
to select a different compartment.
Despite my caution the gang got out at my stop. I had walked part of the way
home before I spotted the youths ahead of me. There is a taxi rank at the
station so I could have taken a cab. But my journey is only 200 yards along
a busy road, a left turn and I'm 30 paces from my front door.
They were waiting by the public telephone box. I was half expecting it, but
what happened still startled me. It seemed that suddenly I was surrounded.
As I write, what happened next comes back in mental snapshots. The gang of
about six, encircling me; the 12-year-old curious; one or two of the gang
hostile and one in particular exuding menace.
The next snapshot: a pale, intense face, about 17 years old with uneven
small teeth, small bat-ears, close-cropped head which he shook vigorously
from side to side, up and down, uttering a string of obscenities, unleashing
an intense, intimidating rage.
The young man radiated instability. I felt that he knew he could frighten,
terrify, use his rage like a tool - as effective as a knife.
As I wilted under the barrage of verbal abuse I feared that he did not know
how dangerous he could be. Then I thought: perhaps he knows himself better
than I think he does. He's playing Russian roulette with his personality,
and it is pointed at me.
Thankfully that night he could switch off, and he did.
'Why're you shaking?'
The question came not from him but from one of the gang, as I stood
transfixed and trembling, my briefcase under my right arm, my left hand
gripping the case to steady my tremor.
The question may have been a taunt, but I think not.
'I've got Parkinson's disease. It makes me shake.'
The pale face, inches from mine, turned off the torrent of invective and
threat like a tap. I do not think he had noticed my shakes because he was
concentrating on my face, with a terrible intensity.
And now not a snapshot, but a soundbite. 'What's that]' It was not a
question. It was an expression of astonishment, with an undertone of
something else. As my mind replays and rehears the episode, time slows.
Until that point, the incident unreels before me, like a video cassette on
fast forward.
But that particular second seems to stretch. Each fraction of time contains
a syllable which I analyse, and the analysis tells me that my relationship
with my verbal assailant was going to change.
'What's that] My grandad had that]'
I cannot fully account for the few seconds that followed. Until then I was
vividly aware of what was happening, what was said. But these moments were
suffused by relief to the exclusion of all else.
I do remember that the tone of the sound around me had changed. Hostility
had been replaced by murmurs, the mumbles and mutters that serve as words
when taken aback by somebody's bad news.
My verbal assailant turned into awkward, uncomfortable protector. 'Yeah, my
grandad had it. Wouldn't have done you if we'd known, mate. We don't do sick
people'n that, old people 'n such.'
The 12-year-old, like a mascot among them, piped up: 'Yeah mate, we don't do
that, not sick people.'
An awkward moment for the gang and me, the let-off victim, followed. We all
wanted to get about our business, but their route was also my route.
It was almost comic. I was a nuisance, but they were too polite to say so.
We had been thrown together, and now wanted to make our farewells - like
guests at the end of a dinner party, wanting to disengage from someone who
wants to prolong the bonhomie.
Honour was at stake, theirs and mine. To turn back would have been to impugn
their word that I was safe, and would have injured my pride. At last it was
resolved. The gang set off ahead of me, but looked back after a few paces,
then slowed, obliging me to turn tail or catch up.
And so I started the next block home, the muggers became escorts as far as
my street and the aggressor turned protector, now almost solicitous, was by
my side. By then I felt I had to offer him reassurance: 'I manage alright,
really . . .'
He nodded. We walked on. 'My mum's got problems. Needs kidney dialysis, uses
a machine, every week.'
We got to the corner of my street, and it was at that point that the
12-year-old offered his own reassurance: 'You can stop shaking now.'
I can not explain what I did next, because it was not necessary. Even as I
did, I wondered if I was being tactless, or crass, or cowardly. I had a
Pounds 20 pound note in my pocket. 'Can I pay your fare home?'
They shook their heads. 'We don't want your money, mate.' And they continued
their predatory journey east.
I did not tell the police. I have been mugged before when credit cards and
passport and briefcase were taken at knifepoint. I told the police that
time. This time I lost nothing. The incident and my subsequent silence still
makes me feel uneasy, but I felt bound by a code.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Modigliani transformed - William Packer enjoys a
remarkable exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXHIBITION may be important for many reasons, consolidating a reputation
beyond question perhaps, or confirming doubts and reservations. Venice has
already enjoyed two such this year; on the one hand the Biennale's
magnificent omaggio to Francis Bacon, still on at the Museo Correr, on the
other, the definitive Marcel Duchamp retrospective that was the previous
show sponsored by Fiat at the Palazzo Grassi. But actually to transform our
understanding of an artist and his work is something else.
The exhibition is drawn from the private collection of Paul Alexandre, a
friend of Modigliani's. The scope and richness of it all are the surprise
and the delight. Alexandre died in 1968 at 87. As a young doctor with a
practice in Montmartre, he came to know many artists, whom he befriended and
supported. He met Modigliani, some three years his junior and only lately
come to Paris, in 1907 and was his first, for some years his only patron.
Their close friendship continued until 1914 and Alexandre's marching off to
war, after which they never saw each other again, Modigliani dying of
Spanish influenza in notoriously tragic circumstances early in 1920.
In the course of their association, Alexandre amassed an extraordinary
number of drawings, some 430 in all, amounting to nearly half those extant,
along with a great quantity of intimate documentary material. It is not that
the existence of his collection was unsuspected, for he would lend
particular items from time to time to exhibitions, and he released a few to
other collections. But Alexandre had always meant to publish it himself,
with his own account of Modigliani as he knew him, and so kept it all very
close. Now at last his son, Noel Alexandre, has kept that tacit promise.
The period is from 1906 to 1914 which is covered exhaustively but
exclusively by means of the artist's working drawings, from the merest hint
of an image to the most fully realised of studies. The 'working' epithet is
the key, for the address is practical, unselfconscious and immediate
throughout. There is nothing here of the precious or the refined indulged
for its own sake.
Modigliani was a remarkable natural draughtsman, blessed with the swiftest
and most delicate of hands, but it is the use to which he put his gift that
is the thing. Time and again, presented en serie, we find the particular
image that engrossed him at a given moment developed and refined through any
number of subtle variations until it becomes fixed and certain - and all
achieved with an economy and attack that together take the breath away. But
there is much more to this work, both singly and collectively, than the mere
demonstration of technical mastery.
His enduring preoccupation was with the figure, most especially the female
figure, but it was its resolution, whether as painting or sculpture, that
was always for him the larger end. And it is in the clarification of those
transitions in the development of the work, that before seemed quite
arbitrary, that the true importance of this new material lies.
A new-found interest in the primitive and the archaic, in the sculpture of
Africa, the Pacific and Minoan Greece alike, was the currency of Paris in
the mid-1900s. With such contemporaries as Brancusi and Picasso close at
hand, Modigliani was hardly alone in responding to it in his work, but no
longer may we read his response as sudden, arbitrary and merely fashionable.
Here in the earlier dancers, the tumblers and acrobats we find at once the
immediacy of the life-model in the studio, and yet the foreshadowing of the
classical, schematic simplicity of the caryatids and statuary to come. And
even in those endlessly repeated formal studies for carved heads and
kneeling, bending, swaying figures, those caryatids and decorative capitals,
again we find, if only by the subtlest of inflexions in face or pose, all
the active energy of the model as she lives and breathes.
So it is again later on, as what once seemed the abandonment of sculpture is
shown to be an easier and natural return to painting. The kneeling caryatids
become kneeling and then reclining figures, and the model is there again in
the studio as the sharp, sculptural contour softens into palpable flesh. How
sculptural those great reclining nudes of Modigliani's last years now appear
 -would that a few of them were in the show: and how humane the carvings,
for all their totemic formality.
The Unknown Modigliani, Drawings from the collection of Paul Alexandre, is
at Palazzo Grassi, until January 4. Then it goes on a world tour until 1996,
sponsored by Fiat, carrier Alitalia.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Bitten by the Golden Lions - Nigel Andrews survives
the film festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE in a state of advanced mental befuddlement this year, pink
elephants have been replaced by golden lions. With prize night still two
days off, we have been bombarded with the beasts. Steven Spielberg,
breasting a sea of Jurassic Park mania, came to accept a career achievement
Lion. On the same night Spielberg himself tried to present a special Lion to
veteran director and Venice festival chief Gillo Pontecorvo. 'No, no, you
keep it]' said Signor P, clearly suffering from lion confusion himself. And
to top things off, the TV screens in the festival theatre lobby have been
re-pumping endless footage of past Venice winners winning past Golden Lions.
Lionitis is a notifiable cultural disease, so we critics have been comparing
notes as to the likeliest victim on prize night. Robert Altman may draw the
short paw for Short Cuts, his majestic three-hour fresco of Los Angeles life
(reported on last week). Then again Maria Luisa Bemberg's Don't Talk About
It, Rolf De Heer's Bad Boy Bubby and Krzystof Kieslowski's Blue have all
been lionised by different segments of the festival audience.
The Argentinian film comes from the lady who gave us Miss Mary and I, The
Worst Of All: Bunuel-suave tales of sex, gnomic violence and religious
dissidence. Drawn from a Magic Realist novel by Iulio Llinas, Don't Talk
About It tells of dwarf girl Carlotta, her normal-height widowed mother who
hopes to marry her off, and Marcello Mastroianni as a lovestruck charmer who
keeps travelling round the world and back again before finally popping the
question to the girl.
This short/tall, May/December, wanderer/homebody romance is just one of the
film's dotty charms. Bemberg draws a portrait of the little town as rich as
a Marques story. Gossip is the main local industry, closely followed by
social hypocrisy. When the Mayor dies in the middle of a wedding - that
wedding - everyone pretends not to notice; and he is shoved into a bathful
of ice-cubes afterwards so as not to spoil the party. Like an impossible
wine the film goes its sweet, dry, intoxicating way towards an ending no
less startling and funny for being utterly inevitable.
Bad Boy Bubby from Australia takes Magic Realism and turns it into - let us
register a new genre - Agit-Surrealism. Dutch-born writer-director Rolf De
Heer has a nasty mind and wants to share it with us. His hero (Nicholas
Hope) is an overgrown baby held hostage into his 20s by a large and lustful
Mum. She keeps him at home (grey walls, cockroaches) right up to the day
that Dad (dog collar, dirty beard) returns, encouraging the boy to kill them
both with Clingwrap. Then it is out into the world with Hope, mixing his
perceptual innocence and untutored morals with every dodgy group from a
Salvation Army platoon via a grunge rock band to a cerebral palsy ward.
Good taste? De Heer has never heard of it. Sex, murder, foul language and
blasphemy are on tap, plus enough political incorrectness to set back the
cause of group dogma by a century. For its first half-hour Bad Boy Bubby
seems like one of those essays in onanistic outrage we expect from young
directors. But it gathers its awful logic around it like a mudstained robe
and by the close is dispensing a marvellous cauterising wit and wisdom.
Blue is the latest film in the colour-fashion of the year. Britain's Derek
Jarman has lent the title to Poland's Krszystof Kieslowski who goes to Paris
to tell the tale of a young woman (Juliette Binoche) battling bereavement
pains. Husband and daughter lost in car crash; ghosts from past and ghouls
from future humming towards her; and a film that becomes an unforgettable
series of still lives stirred to sinister movement, as 'everyday' objects
and events turn into a danse macabre of the soul.
The film opens soon in Britain. So do several of the myriad American movies
that maestro Pontecorvo waved into Venice, using a baton that seems to have
magical power over all of Hollywood. The VIPs glittered as they came:
Harrison Ford, Tina Turner, Robert De Niro, Madonna, Woody Allen, Daniel
Day-Lewis, Martin Scorsese, Spielberg . . . This is a struggling,
underfunded film festival on the Adriatic? Gaze on your thrice-larger
budget, Cannes, and despair.
Many of the directors attended Venice's much-puffed Artist's Rights
conference. This 48-hour thinkathon began with public speeches under Tiepolo
ceilings, went private for a day and a half's commission work, then unveiled
its resolutions in the Lido's Hotel De Bains (setting for Visconti's Death
In Venice). One hundred and twenty world film-makers gathered, putting the
event on a par with an Oscars ceremony. Result: the founding of a High Court
For The Freedom Of Expression In Cinema And The Audio-Visual Arts (where but
in Italy can one spirit up a high court at will?), several proposed GATT
reformations and a mile-long paperchase of decrees and sub-decrees.
Being sceptical about auteurs and auteurs' rights in a collaborative
high-cost art like cinema, I look forward to dissecting this symposium
later. Not here, nor now. Venice is in the madness of wind-up phase. We must
mention the films that boasted, if not quality, large quantities of vitality
or eccentricity. Jean-Luc Godard's Helas Pour Moi: hurling poetry,
philosophy and jagged mise-en-scene at star Gerard Depardieu as we and he
wander round scenic Lake Geneva. Clara Law's You Seng from Hong Kong: its
6th century battle scenes like painted scrolls come to life. Robert De
Niro's directing debut A Bronx Tale: pouring doo-wop music over a catchy
story of Italian-American boyhood. Dominic Sena's Kalifornia: a road-movie
with murders, in which bad couple Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis get their
kicks on Route 66. And Abel Ferrara's Snake Eyes: Harvey Keitel and Madonna
rising (mostly) above a steamy-specious script about movie-making.
There were also booby prize contenders. A Plastic Lion ex aequo should go to
Joseph Kay and John Yorick's The Hollow Men, in which a terminal Euro-beach
plays host to murky photography and ear-bashing alterations of Verdi music
with existential dialogue, and to the portentous agonies of Joao Botelho's
Here On Earth, 90 minutes of pained attitudinising in which Munch's 'The
Scream' seems to have visited Portugal and bitten the whole country.
Disappointing also were two films from well-loved veterans, Ermanno Olmi's
The Secret Of The Old Wood and Eric Rohmer's The Tree, The Mayor And The
Cultural Centre. Olmi's film is a green fable about an endangered forest,
full of talking animals and Disneyish whimsy. Rohmer's film is a Green fable
about local politics and Euro-environmentalism: as thrilling as a Party
Political Broadcast by Jonathan Porritt in French.
The Lion looks on all these candidates and sharpens its claws. But Venice is
not just about 'Who wins?' Every year it conjures variety and inquiry,
sideshows and seminars, from a budget that was never large and is getting
smaller. This year we had retrospectives (a look back at 1943 in world
cinema); discussion events ('Music and Cinema' with Ennio Morricone, 'Opera
and Cinema' with Riccardo Muti); documentaries and video programmes
(including Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's brilliant TV series on DW
Griffith); and the Artists' Rights think-in. Sometimes at Venice the critic
feels as if he has gone back to school again. But in a festival as
multi-faceted as this, and as unapologetic about shaking hands with
Hollywood, there are as many school treats as school trials.

THE TIMES world chess championships began on Tuesday, but with no radio
commentary even on Radio 5. Chess is no more use to radio than algebra.
Radio 3 at least marked the Kasparov-Short contest with its Sunday revival
of David Benedictus' play En Passant, about a lower-level meeting, between
two immigrant champions from east Europe at a hard-up provincial congress.
Nevinsky (Dave King) thinks he had been shopped by Groenmann (TP McKenna) in
their old days and is determined to beat him. That is really all the plot.
It was fun and it was about chess.
'Nobody,' said Tim Crook of Independent Radio Drama Productions lately, 'can
match the millions of pounds' worth of co-production, direct funding, grants
and sponsorship which IRDP has achieved with LBC,' but then he did not
expect LBC, the London independent station, to come off the air. He hopes
that IRDP will find the work to keep them going, as indeed they deserve. I
hear their plays whole on tapes, not fragmentarily as on LBC; those I have
had lately all took awards at the 1993 International Radio Festival in New
York. 1000 to One, by Gella Richards, a telephone SOS to a rape-report group
by the victim of a male rape, won a gold medal for writing; Day Out, by Tom
Newell, a lifer's official day of freedom from prison, a silver for
direction.
Getting Back, by Ben Rice, was more generous with story and character. Two
telephone salesmen in a dubious company of stationery dealers try an
exchange of personalities; the more honest comes off best. This won a bronze
for best comedy special (sic). All were directed and produced, ably but
unambitiously, by the tireless Tim Crook and Richard Shannon. I wish them
luck.
They are not likely to seek help from any of the organisations mentioned in
The Gift Horses (Radio 4, Thursday), the first of two programmes about
charities. It was a thoughtful, well-informed survey of sensibly-organised
charitable activity. The 1980s, we were reminded by Andy Downes of Centre
Point, began a period of earnest 'can't afford it'; but Live Aid's
television use of the Ethiopian famine led to better understanding that
charity required little more than credit-card and telephone.
We heard of the different approaches likely to be most effective when
professionally handled. The request must be a 'wooing', with mutual respect
between giver and taker. Legacies must be correctly worded. Overt pity or
patronising should be avoided, so each side should feel respect. (One hopes
that the lady who offered her old stair-carpet for the residents of Centre
Point to sleep in was not too much offended by their refusal.) These maxims
were not put out by BBC presenters, but by executives of such outfits as
GEC, Campaign for Oxford, Chapter One, Save the Children and the Royal
National Institute for the Blind. The one BBC presenter was John Skrine -
who is now a charity administrator.
I am not usually keen on Radio 2's Spotlights, those audible
reference-books, but I could not resist Wednesday's, on Mary Martin, my
all-time favourite musical leading lady. As a fan I most enjoyed items like
'Wonderful Guy' from South Pacific (though I would rather have had 'I'm
gonna wash that man right out of my hair'), and a recollection of Dolly Levi
in Hello Dolly in 1965.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Tippett goes West - New York City Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITTEN'S operas are as much part of the repertory in New York as they are
in London, but of Tippett's, none had been professionally staged here until
last Thursday, when City Opera introduced 'The Midsummer Marriage' as the
first new production of its 50th anniversary season. Instant impressions
were gladdening. As the front curtain lifted, the music seemed at home here.
Christopher Keene, the company's driving force as general director and
conductor, had the orchestral introduction going with enthusiasm: the
accelerating pulse and the fizzing lines, full of promise, gave us a
Broadway Tippett - a valid slant on a composer for whom American music of
all sorts has seemed vital and refreshing and democratic. This was going to
be some show.
Unfortunately the orchestra's excitedness remained its only virtue. That
rough vigour offered some continuing hope when rhythms were smudged or
coarsened, as they so often were; it wore a bit thin when the violins kept
sounding strained in music that ought to be tense only with athletic
achievement. A cruel, mocking fate it is that goes on placing supreme and
difficult 20th-century scores - 'Moses und Aron' in 1990, 'Die Soldaten' in
1991, 'Doktor Faust' last year - in the hands of musicians so ill-equipped
or ill-prepared to do them justice.
The cast was dodgy too. Dennis McNeil had the springing tone necessary for
Mark's lyrical effusions, but Nina Warren as Jenifer had vibrato problems,
especially in high-flying passages. Jan Opalach was also below his best as
King Fisher. He came through to a strong resolve at the end, but before that
this capitalist-materialist had seemed a weedy sort of threat. Most
effective - perhaps this has to be so - were the secondary pair: Elizabeth
Futral was neatly in tune with Bella's line and demeanour, and Brad
Cresswell was a gentle-voiced Jack.
Francesca Zambello's production, designed by Kevin Rupnik, was much milder
than one had been led to expect by other work of hers and by the advance
publicity. We were promised a 'Midsummer Marriage' resituated in the
American West, but all this meant was that the acting space was surrounded
by drapes showing monochrome views of Monument Valley, that three Native
American symbols (earth, sky, sun) arrived in neon lights, and that the
Ancients looked like Mormon settlers. The chorus, in soft-shaded modern
clothes, could have belonged anywhere at any time in the last half-century
or so.
One sensed budgetary constraint more than creative rethinking: the look was
bald. There was not much magic. Where the musical images suggest a European
tradition of the enchanted wood, here was a stark empty space. Dappled
flutes, distant horn calls and paeans to the sun have little to do with the
deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, and though of course those places have
their own sacredness, it is a sacredness of space, and not aptly conveyed at
all by a curtained-off square. There was no sense that the transformation of
the central couple was coming about through an immersion in nature and
ancientness.
Rather it seemed to be engineered, in some obscure way, by the dancers.
Zambello had Mark and Jenifer appear several times in the second act, led on
like zombies as the ritual dances proceeded. The hunting narratives
specified by the composer were suspended: Susan Marshall's choreography was
a more abstract display of youth and beauty, centred not on a solo male
dancer but on a male-female pair, surrogates for the dumb principals.
Action overtook allegory. Instead of being another view, the dancing was
part of the same story, a story that ended not with the union of Mark and
Jenifer but with that of Mark and the dancer Strephon, seated together in
the middle of the stage as the music ended. This felt imposed and
mean-spirited: distrustful of the opera's metaphor of marriage as a
stabilisation and fulfilment of personality. Tippett is not dealing with a
Mark-Strephon whose two halves have to learn to admire one another, but with
a Mark-Jenifer whose two halves must learn to understand one another.
Still, the composer looked delighted to be on the New York stage at last,
joining the cast for curtain-calls in a dapper but, for him, restrained
outfit of pink bow tie, light blue jacket, mid-blue trousers and casual
white shoes. There are three further performances during the next three
weeks.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Blood on the music stands - Off The Wall / Antony
Thorncroft watches the battle for survival between London's orchestras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council always keeps its bad news for the run up to Christmas (ask
Kent Opera which lost its grant during these dog news days). This year, on
16 December, it will announce which two of the four major London orchestras
that it funds (the LSO, the LPO, the RPO, and the Philharmonia) will lose
their grants. The LSO, with its Barbican residency, knows it is safe, but
the other three are fighting furiously for their subsidy.
The cause of the RPO seems lost. It has managed to organise its operations
so commercially that it relies on the Council for Pounds 400,000, or just 7
per cent of its annual income, and the groundswell view is that it could
survive on its own wits.
But the Arts Council's master plan to merge the LPO and the Philharmonia
into a super-band for the South Bank, where the LPO is already house
orchestra, and the Philharmonia first reserve, has quickly hit the rocks.
The Philharmonia approached the LPO to discuss such a deal, which would mean
an enlarged orchestra with an enlarged grant. The Philharmonia was even
willing to accept the LPO's name. But the LPO has rejected the idea of a
merger. It no doubt feels that having won the residency at the South Bank
only last year it is in a strong position to hold on to its autonomy - and
take any extra money going.
The Arts Council, in a display of discretion which comes close to cowardice,
abandoned its responsibility for selecting the orchestras it plans to drop
as clients and persuaded a judge, Sir Leonard Hoffman, to assume the role of
Solomon. With the officially favoured option of a merger smothered at birth
he will require all his skill to prevent what is already a mess, getting
even messier.
On Wednesday the Gate opens again at Notting Hill. London's most successful
pocket theatre, with an awards list as long as it is small, has been closed
for enlargement. Thanks to Pounds 80,000 from Allied-Lyons, which owns the
pub below, it can now seat 130 as against the paltry 56 before.
The formula stays the same - forgotten classics of world drama. Naturally
for a theatre which has mined treasure from the Golden Age of Spanish drama,
the new season opens with a Spanish play, but Bohemian Lights is by Ramon
Maria del Valle-Inclan, Spain's leading early 20th century dramatist. Then
the world premiere of The Madman of the Balconies by the Peruvian writer
Mario Vargas Llosa; and finally a British premiere for Strindberg's last
play, The Great Highway.
For the Gate this is a conventional repertoire. There follows a group of
comedies that are real curiosities, works by a 17th century Mexican nun, a
farce translated from the Sanskrit, and a Danish comedy.
Actors at the Gate are not paid, but are given travel expenses and a free
lunch. Artistic director Laurence Boswell and producer Caroline Maude earn
just Pounds 5,000 each a year. They balance the books by picking up prizes,
like a Pounds 25,000 Prudential Award for the Arts. But the very poverty of
the Gate has been the key to its success. Because the actors come free it
can employ them by the bus load and mount grandiose classics way beyond the
resources of our national companies: for a production of Queen Elizabeth II
a cast of 32 trod the match-box stage.
They are happy to do so because the Gate is a marvellous take off spot. Its
first director, Lou Stein, runs the Palace, Watford; its second director,
Giles Croft, is at the National; and Boswell's predecessor, Stephen Daldry,
has just taken over the Royal Court. Six of the younger actors in the
current National Theatre company were signed from the Gate.
Three of the Gate's past successes will be broadcast on Radio 3 this autumn.
The advent of Classic fm a year ago seems to have given Radio 3 a shot in
the arm, not least in terms of its audience. It now takes 6 per cent of
radio listeners as against 5 per cent, and is still gaining. Not quite up to
Classic's impressive 10 per cent, but commendable all the same.
Radio 3's autumn schedule continues the quiet revolution. It is launching a
new show case programme, Music Matters, on Saturday evenings, with Sunday
repeats, which should secure its highest audience. It is taking all the live
opera relays from the Met in New York, which Texaco has sponsored for over
half a century, so 20 Saturday nights on Radio 3 will be opera nights; it
has got into bed with Channel 4 over Derek Jarman's movie Blue, which it
will transmit simultaneously with the TV screening, surely the first time a
film has been broadcast on the radio; and in January it introduces its first
music programme, pop and all, aimed at children since Pied Piper in the
1970s. And it has silenced all those who thought civilisation ended when
Radio 3 started to smarten up last year.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Records: British pop award takes the respectable route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WELL, caution and common sense prevailed, and the judges of the Mercury
Prize, Pounds 25,000 in readies for the creators of the best British pop
album of the year, gave the money on Wednesday night to Suede for their
eponymous album, Suede. If the Mercury wants to be the equal of the Booker
in terms of outrage it will have to do better than that. If it wants to
prove that the pop industry is as respectable and export minded as the
manufacturers of widgets it could hardly have done better.
Last year the judges of the first Mercury Prize took something of a flier
and selected Screamadelica by the Scottish group Primal Scream. It added
30,000 to the sales of their album but hardly made the band international
stars.
This year the bookies' favourite won. Suede are the brightest young British
band. They are fashionably androgynous, not to say gay, in a coyly blatant
way, with lots of nudges, and bold images, in their lyrics. They appeal to
young girls, who like the fact they resemble them, and to young boys, who
enjoy a cathartic brush with the wild side. They are the type of band that
record executives feel easy with, that they want the public to like.
This is amazingly tuneful music, in the mainstream tradition, with echoes of
everyone from David Bowie to Duran Duran, but with lyrics that make the
Rolling Stones sound like sissies. The strongest song is 'Animal Nitrate',
with its oblique druggy story line, while 'Metal Mickey' is equally tuneful
about sex.
Suede manage both hummable melodies and a louche image, which promises a
long international career. It is music for hairdressing salons and for
American arenas, and is only revolutionary in not being aimed at the dance
clubs, which have dominated the music scene for too long.
What of the other nine short listed albums? Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me
Yet, by Gavin Bryars, was the essential long shot, the bizarre album which
ensured lots of publicity for Bryars and for the Prize. Last year this role
was taken by John Tavener's The Protecting Veil, which offered some link
between the popular and the classical worlds. Bryars spiritual input,
although genuine, is more ragged than Tavener's seamless mock medievalism.
Its inspiration was the song of a street beggar and it has the impact,
powerful but upsetting, of the gutter. It grates and irritates and lingers.
Then came a group of albums which reveal individuals with their own wayward
visions edging towards the commercial. The most interesting was No
Reservation by Apache Indian. This successfully merges street sounds,
especially the obtrusive Jamaican Ragga, and its incessant hypnotic lyrics,
with the equally mesmerising Asian Bhangra music. It is a powerful mix, more
stimulating than soulful, but a good, if optimistic, vision of young urban
living and brings Indian music into the mainstream at last.
New Wave by The Auteurs is solidly student music, bed-sitter images for the
1990s stuck in the sound of the early 1970s. Here again the lyrics are worth
attention and the orchestrations are not afraid of cellos and a subtle bass
line. There is a committed intensity in New Wave and if writer-singer Luke
Harris owes something to Leonard Cohen in his vocal approach it is a
worthwhile debt.
The Mercury judges could not totally ignore current popular taste, however
debased, and hot favourites with Suede were club band Stereo MC. Connected
was the album with the hit singles, songs lapped up on the dance floor but
smooth enough for listening. There is a little rap; an easy groove; and
loads of spirit to make this the acceptable sound of the times, funky but
unlikely to scare the horses. The other main commercial challenger was New
Order. Republic shows a welcome return to form for Peter Hook's enduring
band. This is dreamy, well crafted, mature pop music.
Dina Carroll and PJ Harvey were the women candidates. Carroll's So Close is
old fashioned, American soul. It is a big voice revolving around a small
emotional circle. Rid of Me by PJ Harvey is more interesting. The voice has
a wistful intensity which you can hardly escape from, and if the songs are
despairing at least genuine depths of feeling are being plumbed.
The final two albums show up the limitations of the Mercury Prize. Both were
short- listed to satisfy contradictory and unfulfillable demands. Stan
Tracey is one of the UK's longest serving and best loved jazz musicians. His
tribute to even greater Greats, such as Ellington and Rollins, in Portraits
Plus appeals to the coterie of jazz fans and to sentimental judges. In
contrast Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales could also never win because Sting
obviously does not need Pounds 25,000, or a career boost, and you cannot
honour such an established artist without revealing a total lack of
imagination, even if his album is the probably the best group of pop songs
written in the past year. Sting would doubtless have given the Prize to a
deserving international cause. Suede, showing that they have quickly assumed
the trappings of success, gave the money to cancer charities.

THE LOVE SONGS OF NATHAN J SWIRSKY by Christopher Hope Macmillan Pounds
13.99, 190 pages
ON THE CONTRARY by Andre Brink Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 376 pages
HOME by Ronald HarwoodWeidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 14.99, 346 pages
THE POINT scarcely needs to be made again, that White South Africa,
particularly the English-speaking element, has produced a remarkable number
of distinguished writers in proportion to its small population.
Three of the country's best contemporary novelists are on parade this month:
Christopher Hope, expatriate for many years but still returning frequently
to his roots; Ronald Harwood, also expatriate, better known for his work in
the theatre; and Andre Brink, based today in Cape Town, who has come over
from the Afrikaners.
Christopher Hope has produced, in The Love Songs of Nathan J Swirsky, a
sequence of stories set in 1951 in the new Johannesburg suburb of
'Badminton'. Some of them have been read by the author on Radio 4, and
listeners will already know that their charm and brilliance lie in Hope's
trick of showing life in this absurd and utterly realistic apartheid
community through the eyes of the children - a very different perspective on
that reality.
The surface detail is lovingly nostalgic. The appalling mother who can only
think in racist euphemism; her long-suffering husband, tempted by more
liberal values: 'We try to treat our servants as part of the family . . . At
Christmas and Easter the servants are always included. We don't have to do
it. We choose to do it'; the Indian topsoil man and the unmentionable
African nightsoil gangs; the Torch Commando of ex-servicemen, chasing
burglars in the blue-gums and cursing the National Party government: 'This
is a damn silly country. I went off to fight the Nazis and I came back to
find that the place was being run by dyed-in-the-wool fascists. Thanks for
nothing]'; Bobby Locke; Tootal rayon shirts; 'Which twin has the Toni?';
and, at the heart of it, Nathan J Swirsky, the newly-arrived Jewish
pharmacist, loved by the kids because he is 'grown-up but . . . not
grown-old'.
This is a wonderfully funny book, and I am happy to offer the phrase for the
dust jacket, but the copywriters must add that this is tragi-comedy. For you
begin to realise that Hope is crafting a metaphor of South Africa: there is
the dynamite factory down the road, which the children fear will blow up one
day; there is the Old Age Home for Jews from Europe; there is the black
servant, laughing at them all, and soon to give Mrs van Reenen a bun in the
oven; and in the end Swirsky joins the Black Zionists. The publisher
compares it with the Lake Wobegon books, but that underestimates the
achievement. It has the makings of a small classic.
Andre Brink has never hesitated to use his novels to tackle the Big Themes
of South African history and society; it must also be granted that he has
always spoken out courageously and, as an Afrikaner, has been in a more
exposed position than the Gordimers and the Hopes. His latest novel, On The
Contrary, is powerfully ambitious and is drawn from a little-known
historical rebellion in the 1730s Cape of Good Hope against the corrupt
Dutch rule of the East India Company. Its leader was a French adventurer
called Estienne Barbier.
This narrator and anti-hero was a rogue, a con-man, a fantasist, a coward, a
seducer, a murderer, a complete villain - but, imagines Brink, before his
ghastly execution he came to understand what the Whites were inflicting on
Africa, to feel shame, to accept responsibility.
This is a long way from the gentle subject matter of Miss Brookner and
Francis King and most new novels, and Brink does not hesitate to use every
trick of his trade, from Derrida to magical realism, from Cervantes to a
Scheherezade slave girl and the accompanying shade of Jeanne d'Arc. One of
many difficulties is, I suspect, that Brink's usual readers are not
accustomed to the experimental and will be baffled by the ingenuity of his
constructions: the constant switch from historical saga to inflated fantasy
(eg the leap from the careful detail of Company administration to Barbier's
visions of unicorn and hippogriff) can be testing for those who preferred
Looking on Darkness or A Dry White Season to Brink's latest, The First Life
of Adamastor.
My own hesitation is different. I am one of those who have always thought
there was something crude about Brink's imagination: there is a
near-uncontrolled lasciviousness and violence about so many of his books -
particularly here - which is worrying in a highly successful international
writer. And, if you press me, I shall add that I think this is a deeply
pretentious novel. But many reviewers will disagree.
Ronald Harwood has made his career as a dramatist - The Dresser, Another
Time, etc. - but he is also a novelist who, 20 years ago, wrote a long
historical saga about South Africa, called Articles of Faith. Now he has
done something similar in Home, which includes a South African section but
is wider in its geographical range. He traces the story of four families
across this century so as to bring together, at the end, a couple who are
respectively 'the descendant of Catherine the Great' and 'the descendant of
wandering Jews'. The autobiographical element is not denied.
It starts with a flight from the pogroms in 1911 and goes on to Hamburg,
Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Cape Town, Paris, Chesterfield  - you name
it. Zionism, Nazism, Communism all feature. The Jewish protagonists are 'the
eternal expatriate'; the moral is to remember Voltaire's warning against
'the madness of those who are certain'. As you would expect of a playwright,
the dialogue reads better than the descriptive narrative.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Books: Case for the prosecution - Robert Taylor considers a
critical new biography of NUM president Arthur Scargill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UNAUTHORISED BIOGRAPHY by Paul Routledge HarperCollins, Pounds 16.99,
288 pages
IT IS hard to imagine a more devastating failure than the efforts of Arthur
Scargill, the mineworkers' union president, to preserve the British coal
industry. Indeed, his belligerence probably played a large part in
destroying the jobs he claimed to be championing. Since the miners' strike
nine years ago more than 140 pits have been shut and more than 100,000 men
made redundant as nuclear power, gas and cheap imported coal have
increasingly met Britain's energy needs.
As the veteran labour journalist Paul Routledge says in his unauthorised
biography of Scargill: 'The more baleful his threats from the presidential
rostrum the quicker the dash for gas became'.
After his landslide election victory in 1981, Scargill took over a union in
which the members were still the shock troops of the trade union movement.
Now it has shrunk so far that it is smaller than the actors' union, Equity.
Under his leadership the NUM has moved to the fringes of the Labour
movement. It no longer has any seats on the TUC general council, not even on
Labour's national executive. As Routledge says: 'By all the formal criteria
of success he has failed'.
Yet the irrepressible Yorkshireman can still stir the TUC's collective
emotions - although not its reason - with his demagogy. He may be 'a virtual
outcast from political society' but he continues to fascinate. Even as his
charisma fades,he still stands out among the grey men at the top of
Britain's unions.
As a former Scargill enthusiast, Routledge describes his pacy book as 'a
voyage of disillusion'. Indeed, it was hard to find any favourable comment
at all about the man throughout its 296 pages until the last strange
paragraph when Routledge writes of Scargill as 'a beacon of support' for
'workers in struggle, anywhere, over whatever issue' and that he should be
'honoured' for this.
Scargill is portrayed as a spoilt child who always liked to get his own way.
Routledge ridicules him as an egoist with a 'sense of destiny'. As a member
of the Young Communist League, the young Arthur attracted the attention of
the party as a self-confident class warrior but apparently his Marxism was
always vulgar with 'sentiments not out of place on the letter's page of a
children's newspaper'.
Routledge derides Scargill's role as the man who closed Saltley coal depot
by mass picketing in the 1972 coal strike. Heroic myth was really a 'fairy
tale'. And he has nothing but contempt for Scargill's leadership during the
great coal strike, suggesting he prolonged the agony of the miners by his
refusal to compromise.
The NUM president would not talk to Routledge during his researches and he
sought with some success to prevent the author from gaining access to his
closest associates. But Routledge makes good use of National Coal Board
archives of the great strike for an insight into Scargill's behaviour during
those tumultuous days. His own intimate knowledge of the coal industry and
the NUM is also invaluable in trying to put Scargill into a wider context.
The trouble is that the author is less than frank about his earlier
closeness to the NUM president. Scargill was a prime contact for Routledge
until May 1984 when the late night phone calls suddenly stopped coming.
The two men were allies who used each other professionally. Routledge
attended drinking sessions with the broad left NUM faction on the union
executive that met in London's County Hotel.
Scargill 'mesmerised a generation of miners', declares Routledge, but it
seems he bewitched the author for a long time too. Yet as the author admits,
Scargill did not come from nowhere. It was the NUM left that 'spawned' him.
Will Paynter, the legendary Welsh miners' leader, called him 'one of the
ablest and most articulate trade union leaders in the country'.
Indeed, Scargill's demands and style raised no criticism at all from the
formidable and articulate NUM left. They may have found him a bit gauche and
a socially stand-offish because he would not drink heavily with them but
they backed him all the way.
It was the revered Mick McGahey, Communist NUM vice-president, who warned
that the union would not be 'constitutionalised' out of a strike in 1984 by
honouring its rule book commitment to hold a ballot before industrial
action. The minutes of the negotiating sessions with the coal board during
the dispute reveal no obvious difference between Scargill and the other NUM
leaders on either tactics or strategy. Perhaps everybody was spellbound by
Scargill's delusions and certainties. But he never disguised his true
intentions.
The NUM president is a revolutionary not a union leader. He has never signed
a wage rise for his members, never compromised, never bargained. 'The
greatest achievement is the struggle itself', he declared after his
devastated members went back to work after nearly a year of pointless
conflict.
Yet in many a miner's home Scargill remains a revered figure because of what
Routledge calls his 'self-deluding sense of destiny'.
The Pounds 60,000-a-year NUM president may have borrowed money from the
union to beautify his home during the strike, as Routledge explains, at a
time when many of his members had to sell or pawn their furniture to buy
food for their children, but many in Yorkshire continue to see him as a man
who can do no wrong. This was always dangerous idolatry. Those who still
believe that Arthur walks on water should read Routledge's devastating case
for the prosecution.

SWING, SWING, SWING. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BENNY GOODMAN by Ross Firestone
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 18.99, 522 pages
ROSS Firestone's admirably detailed, adroitly detached and scrupulously fair
account of the life of Benny Goodman is far from being the first study of
the jazz clarinettist's life but it is likely to be the definitive one.
The story of the Jewish boy born in a Chicago slum (along with 11 other
Goodmans) who became an internationally known and respected musician, in
both the jazz and classical worlds, is the stuff from which Hollywood
biopics are made. In fact, one was made. Firestone describes it, accurately,
as 'absolutely dreadful,' adding that the storyline was 'patently false.'
No similar description can be applied to Firestone's diligent delving into
Goodman's life. Admittedly, his childhood is covered rapidly - by page 38,
the 16-year-old Benny has his first major engagement (for something like
Dollars 100 a week; a fortune for those days) with the band of drummer Ben
Pollack in Los Angeles.
Thenceforward, Firestone chronicles the almost novel-like career and
rags-to-riches life of a complex character whose mercurial behaviour was a
constant talking point to his final days.
As well as recounting many celebrated incidents with his musicians, almost
all of which showed his extreme insensitivity to their feelings - including
the famous glare of disapproval on the bandstand known as 'the ray' -
Firestone amply covers many other aspects of his character which a novelist
would hardly dare to pour into one person.
Such curiosities included his enduring search for the perfect reed; his
inability to remember the names of his musicians; his offhand treatment of
most of the female singers who appeared with his band; the many strains in
the relationship with his influential brother-in-law, John Hammond (Goodman
married into the Vanderbilt family); and his general remoteness and
inability to come to terms with the demands of his fans when he was at the
height of his reign as 'king of swing.'
Firestone does not attempt to explain Goodman's eccentric, enigmatic
behaviour but he does suggest some strong reasons for his quirky character.
A demanding human being, Goodman (indisputably a master clarinettist) was
intolerant of other people's failings because he was so relentlessly
demanding on himself. For him, there was no excuse for anything other than
optimum performance.
Additionally, he had to live with a recurring back problem which plagued him
from the 1940s onwards. Firestone intimates that Goodman was often in pain
while performing, another reason for his unpredictable behaviour.
Inevitably, the peaks in Goodman's musical career are chronicled faithfully:
the success of the big band in the 1930s, followed by the legendary Carnegie
Hall concert in 1938; his association with arranger/bandleader Fletcher
Henderson, whose writing was a key factor in the Goodman band's success; his
study with the British classical clarinettist, Reginald Kell, in the 1950s;
and the classic Goodman quartet recordings with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton,
pianist Teddy Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa.
As far as these are concerned, most readers will be surprised to learn from
Firestone that there were personality clashes between the four which added
tensions to their later reunions; indeed, these usually were reluctant
occasions for all the participants, who had gone on to become major figures
in their own domains.
The conclusion from this consistently readable biography is that Goodman,
like many influential figures in jazz, was a highly complex human being and
no outsider, however inquisitive, will ever be able to grasp the core of his
many faceted personality. Ross Firestone probably has got as close as anyone
ever will.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Books: Time to party with nanny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
THE GREEN KNIGHT by Iris Murdoch Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 15.99, 472 pages
I GREET a new novel by Dame Iris Murdoch as I used to greet a party when I
was a child. There stands Nanny Iris in front of a table groaning with
goodies: egg sandwiches, crisps, jellies, chocolate biscuits, a huge iced
birthday cake, all to be washed down with delicious fizzy Tizer.
I feel elated and at the same time the slightest bit apprehensive. After
tea, faces wiped, we are made as usual to play Hunt the Thimble, or rather
Hunt the Symbol, her version of the traditional pastime, .
This time she has been exceptionally kind and given us in her title The
Green Knight a clue where to look - it recalls the medieval English poem of
chivalry, Sir Gawain and The Green Knight. In case we've forgotten she
reminds us of the story, also summarised in The Oxford Companion to English
Literature thus:
'Arthur and his court are seated at a New Year's Feast in Camelot waiting
for a marvel when a huge green man enters, bearing an axe and a holly bough.
He challenges a knight to cut his head off on condition that the knight
agrees to have his head cut off a year hence. Gawain accepts the challenge
and cuts the green knight's head off: the knight picks it up and rides
away.'
The standard edition of this poem was edited by Tolkien and is still part of
the Oxford English degree course. Could it be that a certain Professor John
Bayley drew the novelist's attention to it? Or was it the version for
children performed recently at the National Theatre? At any rate she has had
a go at bringing it up to date. A group of people in contemporary London - a
'family' not all of whose members are related to each other by blood - go
through a series of crises that approximate to the main sequence of events
in the poem.
Their London base is a rambling four-storey house in Brook Green occupied by
a glamorous widow in her late 40s and her three nubile daughters, whose ages
range from 16 to the early 20s. I hardly need add that this trio are all
incredibly beautiful and stunningly bright.
The lives of the other characters revolve around them and their mother. The
two older daughters revere a history professor called Lucas, a friend of
their late father's and a scholar of teutonic rigour. Lucas was an adopted
child whose parents shortly afterwards produced a son, Clement, who became
an actor.
Intense sibling rivalry developed between the two brothers leading to much
cruelty; wounding memories persist in their adult life. On a dark night
Lucas attempts to settle old scores by hitting his brother over the head
with a baseball bat while they are on a walk. A stranger intervenes and gets
in the way of the blow, saving Clement's life. Lucas faces criminal charges
after the stranger's death but gets off on a plea of self-defence.
That all seems to be safely in the past until, at the start of the novel,
the sisters notice a tall man in a trilby hat with a green umbrella standing
outside the house keeping up some kind of surveillance. He also appears
outside Lucas's house into which, uninvited and much to Lucas's
discomfiture, he enters. He is the stranger who suffered Lucas's blow and
who is not really dead after all. Decoded he is the Green Knight reappearing
a year after his beheading, and now it is his turn to call the tune.
In spite of the improbabilities in the basic premise, Nanny held me
spellbound as she unfolded her tale. There are far too many twists and turns
in a characteristically complex plot to summarise, anyway it would spoil the
fun.
Just as in the poem we never quite know what to make of the Green Knight, in
his incarnation here, called Peter Mir, he remains a man of mystery. He is
violent, he is passive. He demands retribution, he believes in
reconciliation. He is an over-demanding guest, an absurdly generous host. He
is a Jew, a Russian, a Buddhist, a saint, an angel, a millionaire, a
nutcase. He is so protean as to be virtually incredible - but we accept him
like the policeman in An Inspector Calls for his ruthless harrowing of the
buried guilt in the family he investigates.
The three sisters, Aleph, Sefton and Moy, leading their Chekhovian lives in
this heartbreak house, are among the most attractive of Dame Iris's
creations. To balance them there is an assortment of menfolk and one dog,
Anax, who steals the show in the last chapter; animal loyalty and love
surpassing human.
Whatever this novel is trying to tell us at bottom - it sounds as if it is
another lesson in the problem of transgression and atonement - that remains
as difficult to understand as it does in the 24 previous novels by this
writer. But there is no doubting that her narrative skill continues to be as
inventive and energetic as ever. Once again she has presided over a
wonderful party.

COMPLICITY by Iain Banks Little Brown Pounds 15.99, 313 pages
THE VICAR OF SORROWS by A N Wilson Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 391
pages
THE FIRST thing you know about Iain Banks's new novel, already at the first
page, is that you are going to read it through right to the end. A few pages
on, you decide that anything beyond a good compulsive read would be a bonus.
The bonuses keep accruing. By the end you feel you have read a remarkable
novel.
The story is set in Edinburgh, Banks' own stamping ground. Cameron Colley,
the narrator, is an investigative reporter with a local newspaper. When he
is not working he is drinking hard, sniffing speed, addictively playing
upmarket computer games, and carrying on an athletic affair with a friend's
wife.
He is in the process of investigating a series of unsolved murders. But
while this is under way a serial killer is at work. His victims are the
powerful and the rich who, for one reason or another, arguably had it coming
to them. You get an eerie behind-the-camera view of the unknown killer's
attacks which are executed with calculated professionalism. There is a
chilling detachment about the killer's mode of operation, curiously enhanced
by a seemingly arbitrary last-second relenting in one case.
Since the murders - ultimately, and most gruesomely that of his lover's
husband too - all occur while Cameron Colley happens to be close to the
scene and without a plausible alibi, he gets arrested as a prime suspect.
From here, however, the story takes an unexpected turn, echoed by the
novel's title.
The characters are, to a man and woman, from privileged backgrounds,
accomplished, and morally deficient. Their attraction, physical as
otherwise, is superficial. Their pursuits, trivial. Yet the novel moves you
and makes you wonder why. Perhaps an observation Colley makes about the
second central character provides a key to the enigma: 'He's disillusioned,'
says Colley. 'He used to have lots of illusions, and now he's got only one:
that what he's doing will make any difference.' The expected authorial
message is cunningly subverted, thus enforcing the eponymous perception of
complicity through a range of human failings, not least among them, apathy.
Superbly crafted, funny, intelligent, but cold, this is very much a novel of
the time: forget about early social deprivation, child-abuse, unfriendly
environment, not to mention native inadequacy; instead, blame Thatcherism
for everything. A N Wilson has written some excellent books. Chief among
them a biography of Tolstoy which is nothing short of brilliant. His
fiction, however, has been generally marked by absence of vigour. His latest
novel is no exception.
A thoroughly uninteresting clergyman, locked in a loveless, uninteresting
marriage, and going through a familiar crisis of faith in a static imaginary
English village, improbably falls in love with a rather uncharismatic
middle-class girl attached to a band of New Age Travellers who had struck
camp by the village.
The improbability of the affair flows mainly from the clergyman's own
emotional anaemia. It seems that the harder A N Wilson tries to inject life
into emotion, the more academic and contrived it appears. That goes for the
hero's obsessive grief over the death of his mother as for his love for the
girl.
In so far as there is fascination in this novel, it lies in its failure: all
the right ingredients are present. It is as though a lifelike Golem of a
comely aspect has been created. But instead being animated by the living
spirit, it had been fitted with an imperfect motor which the author, you
feel, is desperately trying to crank up at intervals to make the thing move.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Gardening: A super spot for some late-summer lusting -
Spurred by hearsay, Robin Lane Fox roams a world of borders where a mind's
autumn image is transformed into colourful reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MY mind's eye, I have had an image of a late-flowering border, planted as
borders used to be planted in the days of soft watercolours when nobody was
ashamed of golden-rod. In this clear, calm autumn, the image has evidently
grown into a lust, or so I deduce because I have just run it to ground in
the natural habitat of late-summer lusting.
The garden of The Lordship at Benington near Stevenage, in Hertfordshire,
appealed to me on hearsay, a botanical symbol in the Yellow Book and a star
in the Good Gardens Guide. Visiting on the off chance, I find that I have
hit the mark. Next year's TV movie, Late Summer Lusting, has just been
filmed in the garden and I will wait to see if it satisfies the same
instincts which the garden has just satisfied in me.
The Lordship is a site with an extremely long history and a large supporting
farm but the presiding spirit of the garden since 1970 has been Sarah Bott.
Now in her mid-50s, she has the quietly-spoken firmness of an assured
plant-person.
She was born a Fox - part of the family which owned the great gardens at
Glendurgan, Cornwall, which are now a public asset - and her gardening began
at the age of 10. She is living evidence for those who think that gardening
is a genetic mania. She is also evidence for those who think that it is
fostered culturally: her mother Barbara's example has not faded after 40
years, although Hertfordshire is not Cornwall and The Lordship's
quick-draining clay is unsuited to good camellias.
People flock to the garden in February when the snowdrops are out in force
but, although abundant, they are not particularly rare. In my garden guide,
The Lordship is also said to be noted for its border of penstemons. Wherever
is it? I wondered, on arriving at its puzzling entrance. The Lordship stands
in its own park and its architecturally baffling house adjoins such features
as a mock Norman gateway, a broad, ancient moat with no water, and a white
jasmine as high as the eaves of a brick-built wall with overtones of the
18th century.
We began by exploring a clock-wise route: the moat, the keep, and the
problem of black spot on Margaret Merrill, a hugely impressive Magnolia
grandiflora (which had none of the problems of mine as related in this
column recently).
There were some contrary flashes of plantsmanship: I had mistaken a late
eupatorium for a deutzia; Sarah Bott had shown her lemon verbena, 3 ft high
and unscathed by the winters. A square of Rosa moyesii geranium was looking
lovely with its late rose hips; we agreed in disliking the harsh colours of
Rosa cerise bouquet; we disagreed on the respective merits of R.
Fruhlingsgold and Fruhlingsduft.
It seemed like a pleasant outing, but not the satisfaction of a late-summer
lust, while we strolled beneath the pillared veranda swathed in the large
leaves of Vitis coignetiae with views across an amply-lilied lake. The rock
garden was past its best but, in a dell behind it, I did find an emblem for
corporate financiers, reading this column in their search for a new logo: a
rather fine statue of Shylock stands in stone above a planting of White
Honesty.
Away to the left, I caught sight of the best white agapanthus, the ardernei
form which has featured here since I re-met it, long after The Lordship had
been growing it without fuss. Perhaps I should have guessed: we turned the
corner and looked up the length of a hidden double border, longer than
anything in an Oxford college and the translation of my mind's autumn image
into reality.
On either side of a stepped path runs just the border which autumn evokes in
the mind: unusual crocosmias; tradescantias in a second flowering;
polygonums, both common and uncommon; Rose Nevada; the Barnsley white
mallow; marvellous drifts of ligularia; the best violet-blue strobilanthes I
have seen for ages; shaggy annual asters from a seed packet; climbing white
solanum on the pillars of the old brock gateway; more eupatoriums which do
not look like deutzias; the gentle blue spires of Veronica exaltata; and the
tall points of white, like beads, on that quiet winner, Lysimachia
ephemerum, which plainly was enjoying the damp in the ground. Seen from
below, it was breathtaking: it is better from above, replied Sarah, my
companion, the only Bott in the landscape.
When she began, she gained help from reading such writings as those of
Graham Thamas and the Sunday articles of Vita Sackville-West, whose legacy
lives on for the over-50s. She inherited a border which flowered only in
July and had none of the family plants in which she moved: the eupatoriums,
the dusky crocosmia which she knows as Aunt Lucy, the personal echoes of
friends and relations which sound especially familiar to those of us who
started to garden while seriously under age.
As we climbed, I noticed how the border must have been just as impressive in
previous months: Bott recommends the last week in May, when the last of the
tulips match the early border beauties and she prepares for some notable
delphiniums. Like many good gardeners, she disagrees with the usual
perceptions: she finds June and July often to be a disappointment.
The Lordship's long borders do not focus on one or two colours. They do not
exclude plants which rarified gardeners now fail to appreciate: annual
asters, perhaps, or pale pink perennial bolsam. The results reflect the
particular span of a lifetime and match an image, not a fashion. As we
looked down, the guiding spirit declared herself content with her work.
Gardeners have only to look at their results to see imperfections, but true
gardeners are content with progress and the process.
What next, I wonder? For visitors, the answer is a left-hand turn through a
brick gateway into a kitchen garden of mixed penstamons, a wonderful swathe
of the blue Clematis Perle d'Azur, and borders of gold and silver foliage,
some of which have been banished after attempted introduction by her
gardeners.
For the owner, the mid-50s are a time in life for tree planting and
continual weeding because The Lordship's enormous gardens run on a head
gardener and an assistant. In winter, there will be dogwoods in blazing red
beside the lake and winter-scented honeysuckle and hellebores on the ruins
of the old Norman castle. Not every gardener can go to ground in a winter
retreat which has been inhabited for nearly 1,000 years. Before the public
season ends this month, late-summer lusters should pay it a visit and enjoy
borders which live up to any mind's-eye view.
Benington Lordship, five miles east of Stevenage, is open on Wednesdays
(12-5) until September 30 and specially open for FT visitors this Sunday
(2-5).

FT  11 SEP 93 / Property: Land prices start the long climb back - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING land prices are another sign of how the property market has touched
bottom and is rising slowly. In 1988-89, many a village kitchen garden was
sold off with outline planning permission for dwellings. Then, the market
collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent between 1989 and mid-1992,
according to Savills' residential building land price index.
Now, this market is on the turn, gaining 1.8 per cent on average in the
second half of 1992 and a further 7.4 per cent in the first half of this
year. In the Cotswolds, Hurley Lloyd Thorpe reports quick sales of two
sites, each with consent for four houses, at close to the asking prices of
more than Pounds 150,000 (near Chipping Campden) and around Pounds 145,000
(near Stow-on-the-Wold).
Until the middle of last year, the market fell relentlessly. Savills'
Yolande Barnes says this made some site values 'too low when compared to a
residual value (after building costs and developer's profit) based on house
prices - even on the very depressed house prices of 1992.'
Now, though, better land sales early in the year seem to have encouraged
developers, including the local builder who bought the Chipping Campden
site, to look around and plan ahead. In areas where there is not enough
suitable land, developers are bidding up the prices, and a few prime sites
have gone for 20 per cent more than last year. But Barnes does not expect
any sustained increase until house prices move further ahead.
* * *
FARMLAND also is selling well, thanks to the improved EC support payments
for UK farmers that appeared overnight as a result of the devaluation of the
pound almost a year ago. Strutt &amp; Parker recently sold a farm of 188 acres
in Northamptonshire, on the border with Leicestershire, for Pounds 385,000
at auction, quoting a guide price of Pounds 400,000 beforehand. The price
works out at an impressive Pounds 2,073 an acre.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold Pounds 40m of farmland between May and August,
noting that the funds to buy came 'almost exclusively from individuals and
trustees.' They benefit most from legislation that allows 100 per cent
relief from inheritance tax (IHT) for the owner's personal farming, which
includes farming by contract and share farming . In the eyes of the Inland
Revenue, it seems that being a farmer no longer involves getting up early.
Even owning let land allows 50 per cent relief from IHT.
* * *
STONELEIGH, in Warwickshire, is an address that all farmers recognise as the
home of the Royal Show each summer, and of the National Agricultural Centre.
The Stoneleigh Abbey Preservation Trust and Kit Martin (well known for his
conversions of major country houses) are seeking planning permission to
convert the Georgian, Grade I-listed big house, plus its stables and the
home farm, into flats. The state rooms will be kept for the public to see.
To provide the funding, the trust has gone into partnership with Bryant
Country Homes to build new houses on a site next to the home farm, a hotel
near the Agricultural Centre, and two golf courses on arable land at places
on the estate where they will not damage the look of the big house and its
park, designed by Humphrey Repton.
* * *
NEW HOPE awaits the Brighton Marina as well. Housebuilder Barratt and the
troubled leisure group Brent Walker have agreed that Barratt can market 30
existing houses and flats there. Barratt also is preparing plans for more
units at parts of the site it has acquired from Brent Walker, and expects
them to be available for buyers from early next year. Inquiries to 0273-693
636.
* * *
RENTING revived in the recession as a sensible alternative to what had,
suddenly, become the perils of owning your own home. An imposing house now
available (although possibly suited better for a company than an individual)
is Dupplin Castle in Perthshire, built in 1969 by the architect Walter
Schomberg Scott for the late Lord Forteviot of the Dewar's whisky family.
It is astonishing that so prestigious a house - Scottish baronial, late
1960s' version - was built privately only 24 years ago. Like the 1940s'
palaces of India's rajahs, it is gloriously unaware of changing worlds.
Length of the lease and rent are both negotiable with Savills in Edinburgh
(031-226 6961).
* * *
IN WARMER Devon, Craddock House near Uffculme and Tiverton is a Georgian
property with a colonnaded veranda, a good garden and a Victorian
conservatory with vines. The guide price from Jackson-Stops in Exeter
(0392-214 222) is Pounds 750,000. A further 40 acres with farmhouse, barns
and farm buildings are available for around Pounds 210,000.
In Hertfordshire, Tuthill Manor is an intriguing, ancient, half-timbered
house which has, over 30 years, been restored by its present owners into the
glorious manor house, complete with great hall and gallery, it once was.
John D. Wood (071-493 4106) offers it for Pounds 450,000.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Property: Help yourself to a sale - Few houses sell
themselves; most need preparation by the vendor before the buyers arrive.
Gerald Cadogan tells how to go about it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE people who continue to believe their houses will sell themselves.
It is, of course, not that simple. But some close attention to the state of
the property can make for an easier - and more profitable - sale.
Good houses, priced realistically, often sell quickly although they are
still unlikely to match their value of early 1989 or mirror the booming 1993
stock market. But preparation - particularly of houses that may take time to
move - remains a key point.
Put another way, the vendor's job is to present the house so attractively
that the potential buyer cannot overlook its charms and might even fall for
them.
What does that mean if you are selling?
Your family must be ready to help in showing people around, turning off the
ghetto-blaster, or not wandering naked at the wrong time between bathroom
and bedroom. Remind them that, in most cases, the intention is that all
should benefit from the sale/move. The sour atmosphere of a family squabble
does not help a sale.
Do not hasten to tell your neighbours: so says Andrew Smith, of national
agent Strutt &amp; Parker. Word will spread quickly, probably giving the wrong
price. The house will soon become stale news, damaging the short, intense
sales campaign a good agent is likely to recommend. Surprise helps selling.
Buyers like to think of themselves as early birds catching the new day's
worm.
Read the draft of your agent's brochure carefully. Is it a fair, open-minded
description? If you like, you can add a personal note on what the place
means to you. That will help some buyers and should not run foul of the
Property Misdescriptions Act.
Check carefully the fittings mentioned in the text. Are they the ones you
intend to be included in the sale, or will you remove some? Should any be
available as extras? Buyers are not happy if they think they are getting a
house with an Aga but, on completion, find the Aga gone. It could lead to a
lawsuit against you.
The effective time to talk about the house, and how you and your family have
lived in it, is when taking buyers around and you can gauge the sort of
people they are. Remember - they are buying the house, not you. But
mentioning changes you would have made had you the time or money could prove
an irresistible challenge for them to carry out.
Arrange for the photographs in the brochure to be taken as close as possible
to its printing and the house coming on the market - and, says Smith, 'on a
bright, sunny day.' Buyers look for what they have seen in the brochure and
do not like to think it has changed. Repaint before the photographs and do
not change the furniture afterwards. Then, it is clear you are not hiding
anything.
If the garden has its best flowers in the spring but you are selling in the
autumn, include a picture if you have one. Here, the brochure is more use
than viewing.
Have the house tidy, clean and welcoming as if you are awaiting guests. A
few flowers help. But do not overdo the tidying-up or you will reveal your
anxieties. It is more important that the house looks confident and lived-in.
If it is too neat, especially in children's rooms, the buyer will think it
is sterile and go away wondering how anyone could live in such
over-disciplined unreality.
Mow the grass and tidy the garden, at least enough to show that you maintain
it as an integral part of your life there. If there is a tennis court,
remove any weeds. A swimming pool must be clean. Live in the house during
the sale period if possible, and keep as much furniture as you can. The more
homely it is, the better.
Minimise buyers' fears of a large bill for repairs and re-decoration. A
small outlay by you on necessary repainting, clearing gutters, checking
downpipes and fixing loose slates and tiles is almost a sure bet to be
repaid several times over.
Be chary, though, of a complete redecoration; it might put buyers off. You
do not know what colours they like or what furniture they have. (London is
different, particularly in the rich, central area where overseas buyers
often are glad of a completely decorated flat or house into which they can
move at once). Be pleasant and natural to the buyers. Answer their questions
honestly but do not gush. If you have transformed the house from a humble
past, do not be surprised if some are disappointed; they may think it has
become too comfortable for its origins.
Fitted carpets did not exist when most old rectories and farmhouses were
built. Too many now could deter those buyers who prefer polished wood floors
with rugs; they will be happy not to acquire the floor coverings mentioned
as an extra in the brochure. But all buyers are glad of a watertight house.
If the buyers have come a long way, offer them tea or coffee. And do not let
bawling children and yapping dogs put them off even before they have started
to look. If you take them through the rooms, let them go round by themselves
afterwards. It gives the privacy they must have to decide if your house is
the one they want. Finally, if the property is listed, have photo-copies of
the listing entry, and of any mentions in Pevsner's Buildings of England or
articles about it in Country Life, ready for the buyer to take away to read
later.

FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: Clarice Cliff revisited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FANS OF the work of Clarice Cliff will recognise the image pictured here
instantly. Of all the designers associated with pottery her hand-writing is
perhaps the most distinctive.
She became hugely influential in the Art Deco period - even those who have
never been collectors will recognise the bright colours and bold Art Deco
lines which are her hallmark.
Today her ceramics are keenly collected all over the world and fetch high
prices in the world's auction rooms - all of which explains Wedgwood's
decision to reintroduce 17 pieces all redolent of the high period of Clarice
Cliff's work.
All follow original Clarice Cliff shapes but it has not always been possible
to use exactly the same colours. Nevertheless, all faithfully capture the
vitality and boldness so typical of design in the pre-war jazz age. All the
pieces are hand-painted using the same techniques that she nurtured among
her team of young painters, the 'Bizarre girls' (so-called because the bold
range that brought her her most lasting renown was called Bizarre).
All 17 pieces are being issued in numbered, limited editions - mostly of 250
each - and prices range from Pounds 150 for the Football vase (from a design
originally produced in 1929 and 1930) and a wall plaque (originally produced
in 1932 and 1933) to Pounds 250 for a Prunus jar, dating from 1930/31. The
famous Yo Yo vases are Pounds 225 each while the conical sugar shakers
pictured above (in an edition of 500 each) are Pounds 85.
All are on sale now in leading Waterford/Wedgwood rooms.

FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: Barneys moves up-town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most seductive places to shop in New York is Barneys, the sole
surviving downtown department store on the cross between 7th Avenue and 17th
Street. Barneys is a bastion of contemporary classic fashion in Manhattan
with its compelling combination of understated elegance and downtown street
chic. Its only snag has been a lonely location in Chelsea, away from other
stores, turning a trip to Barneys into a special trek.
But this week Barneys moved to a more accessible address in the heart of the
uptown shopping scene, opening a new store at 660 Madison Avenue  - a
stone's throw away from its old rivals, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue,
Henri Bendel and Bloomingdales.
The new Barneys, which cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) to build with its
eight floors and three restaurants, is the first store built from scratch in
Manhattan for 65 years. It is the biggest gamble taken by the Pressmans, the
family behind Barneys, since 1923 when the original store was founded.
Barney Pressman raised Dollars 500 pawning his wife's engagement ring and
put the money into opening the down-town store.
Barneys began in the bargain business. 'We buy Bankrupt, Auction Stocks,
Showroom Samples of Standard Makes] No Junk]' was an early advertising
slogan. But when Fred Pressman, Barneys' son, took over after the second
world war he dropped the discount trade and established Barneys as the New
York store for mens' suits.
It was not until the late 1970s that Barneys ventured into women's wear when
Gene Pressman - Fred's son who now runs the business with his brother, Bob -
pestered his father into letting him open a small women's shop.
Barneys still offers the biggest and, probably, the best selection of men's
suits, shirts and socks in Manhattan, but it has become the staple source of
clothes for the city's hipper career women with labels such as Jil Sander,
Prada and Giorgio Armani.
Women's wear was the catalyst for the move uptown. The Pressmans, who have
forged a financial partnership with Isetan, the Japanese retail group,
realised that if Barneys was to become a serious player in women's fashion
it had to have a prime site.
Barneys' new neighbours are not amused. A three-year struggle to build the
new store was coloured by a behind-the-scenes battle as the Pressmans'
uptown rivals tried to 'persuade' their big designers not to sell to the new
store.
So what have the Pressmans put in their new store? Jil Sander, Prada and
Armani are on the 'classic' third floor with Comme des Garcons and Dolce &amp;
Gabbana on the 'avant garde' fourth. There is also lots of Barneys' own-
label merchandise, a hair salon, a spa and, a sop to the latest New York
female fitness craze, a boxing ring.
The store opened to the public on Wednesday. But the war is not over. The
Pressmans next battleground will be Beverly Hills, where another Barneys is
scheduled to open next spring.

FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: The simple bare accessories of life . . . -
The eternal question: what to buy the man who has everything. Paul Keers has
a few tips for those with cash to spare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEN'S accessories are big business. They are landmark purchases, bought to
commemorate achievements and anniversaries, when people are happy to pay a
little more for a memorable item.
Essentially, they are the male equivalent of jewellery; expensive bits of
decorative metal. But unlike jewellery, they have a function, which excuses
their presence on an executive desk-top or in a trouser pocket.
Many, of course, are bought by women, as gifts for those men who have
everything. That is why accessories come in matching ranges; one successful
gift can then be followed by a succession of coordinating items, in what one
marketing man describes as 'executive desk-dressing'.
But from lighters to blotters, keyrings to penknives, most accessories are
inherently nostalgic. They evoke an image of a traditional man.
No-one has yet begun to market silver-plated computer accessories, or
designer car alarm keyrings; instead, the functions of men's accessory
ranges are locked in a bygone era. And so, manufacturers produce ashtrays
for a generation of men who no longer smoke; blotters and inkwells for
executives who only work on screens; desk-top lighters for smoke-free
offices; and tie-tacks and cufflinks for men who work in polo shirts.
Yet in these times of upheaval, perhaps nostalgia, with its suggestion of
permanence, is what men are seeking. As Alan Duddle, Director of
Merchandising at Dunhill, explains it: 'In buying a brand new product, in a
contemporary design, men are committing themselves to the unknown. Whereas
if they buy a nostalgic design, they are buying something which already has
longevity and credibility.'
The newest accessory ranges for men seem to acknowledge this, and look
backwards in their form as well as their function. The results are personal
accessories designed to offer the reassurance of the past to the executive
who feels unsettled in the present.
Later this month, Tiffany is erdorsing this trend, with its first ever line
of men's accessories. The range extends from lighter to letter opener, from
desk-top ashtray and picture frame to keyring, money clip and cufflinks.
Over two dozen items for men, and all in a single style; not the usual
contemporary Tiffany look, but a design drawn from the streamline movement
of the 1930s.
Called Streamerica, the accessories echo the aerodynamic lines of the
locomotives, aircraft, dirigibles and cruise ships of the period. Each item
has the curved lines, precise seams and rivets in miniature which were the
hallmarks of streamlining.
To reflect the style, the range has been made, not in silver but, for the
first time at Tiffany's, in stainless steel.
'Stainless steel is rarely treated as a precious metal, and given this
quality of metalwork,' explains John Loring, Tiffany's director of design.
'Steel is not the same price as silver, but to do your best with it is even
more labour intensive than working with silver or gold. To properly mill and
finish it is a real labour of love.'
The Streamerica items are made with a precision and weight which makes them
inherently masculine, in spite of a smooth, sensuous feel.
The range is expensive because of the labour involved; a small pocket knife
is Pounds 100, an ashtray Pounds 205.
But, because the items are in stainless steel, they seem much more
appropriate for use today than ostentatious equivalents in precious metal.
'It goes along with our self-imposed sumptuary laws,' agrees Loring. 'It
affords the possibility of showing off craftsmanship, rather than
expenditure on raw materials.'
It seems only right that the range is produced by a company which has a
reputation underlining the similarity between men's accessories and women's
jewellery. Unlike jewellery, of course, men's accessories do have a veneer
of usefulness. But in many cases, it is only a veneer. Is there a male
executive senior enough to merit a Pounds 135 Tiffany letter-opener?
Tiffany is not the only company to be looking to the past in order to appeal
to the modern man. Dunhill's next collection is also based around a 1930s
theme. Dunhill maintains a small archive museum, which tracked down dozens
of historic items for the company.
'Our centenary forced us to look at some of our older products,' explains
the company. 'We realised that, against a background of social and political
upheaval, there was something very comfortable in nostalgia. In an
unpredictable world, it's reassuring to own something which reflects a time
past when things were more comfortable.'
So Dunhill has revived ranges of silver flasks, cigar cases, pocket knives
and lighters all in designs, and bearing a large hallmark, as featured in
their pre-1925 items. There are Sunburst lighters, cufflinks, money- and
tie-clips, in silver decorated with boldly-coloured enamel; again, the
lighters use a 1930s design.
In contrast to brash 'n' flash modern wristwatches that used to typify
Dunhill style, there is a range, the Steel Centenary Collection, directly
inspired by Alfred Dunhill timepieces of the 1930s. These are elegant,
oblong watches, with traditional mechanical movements and blued hands,
offering all the design appeal of the past but with the production values of
the present. At around Pounds 500, their price is far lower than their
precious metal or, indeed, genuine antique counterparts.
'These are progressive, comfortable, up-to-date products,' says Dunhill,
'but they reflect the past.'
That may also be the reason behind the current success of Oris watches. This
small Swiss company, started in 1904, refused to switch to the quartz
technology which transformed the wristwatch market. But, instead of moving
into the four-figure luxury market, they have kept their place as mid-market
mechanical wristwatches (Pounds 175 to around Pounds 600). And along with
the nostalgic sound of ticking, they have also retained the idiosyncratic
styling of watches from the middle of the century.
To most thirtysomething men, these look like the watches their fathers used
to wear. Some models even boast the Oris Big Crown, an over-sized winder
designed so that second world war pilots could adjust their watches without
removing their gloves. Sold in fashionable outlets, such as The Watch
Gallery (Jermyn Street and Sloane Street), they allow modern men to feel
just like their fathers, but as if an inherited watch came along with a
modern service guarantee.
Given the upheavals in design over the past five years or so, many men would
now prefer to mark significant occasions with items whose style has stood
the test of time. In both their personal and their professional lives, they
want to feel linked to a stable past.
Clearly, several big companies feel that that might be described as a fact
after the accessory.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Fashion: The romantic and monastic - Avril Groom advises on
clothes for autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOWS have long since been and gone, orders placed and clothes safely
delivered to the stores. For autumn, it is all over, bar the shopping, which
is is the most nerve-racking part. Will people want to buy what the stores
decree is The Look?
In March, straight after the autumn shows, we asked a selection of the
country's top buyers to give their gut reactions to the key new styles for
every woman's autumn wardrobe. Now that the season has arrived we asked them
again, in the cold light of their buying budgets, to consider how 'new'
looking the average shopper will want to be.
Their initial hunches were good and the majority of their shop rails are now
filled with the themes outlined in spring. The mood falls between a gentle
historical romance and an unadorned monastic simplicity.
It is, of course, in the buyers' interests to persuade us that our wardrobes
need a twice-yearly overhaul. And when fashion undergoes a substantial shift
 -in this case from brash tailoring to self-effacing softness - some new
pieces are unquestionably necessary.
Most of us cannot look as the fashion magazines would have us, because their
featured outfits are new every time, whereas our wardrobes carry the fashion
equivalent to our emotional baggage - clothes that, for reasons of economy
or affection, we will continue to wear whatever the blandishments of the
much-hyped latest look. But one buyer's assertion that 'the secret this
winter is knowing exactly how to mix clothes in an unusual and individual
way' is good news.
A clever assistant, could show you how to make that individual mix by
linking new pieces to old and by using old items in new ways. Several of
this autumn's staples, like a white shirt, skinny rib sweaters, a swingy
long skirt, waistcoats and even a big coat, are probably already in your
wardrobe, languishing unnoticed. A store's art lies in encouraging you to
look at them anew and persuading you of the need for the essentials to
update all you already own.
For example, the dandy look is an early autumn favourite that acts as a
bridge between familiar tailoring and the new fluidity. An integral part of
it is the long white shirt which, to look new, is worn with tails, collar
and undone cuffs flamboyantly on show.
The shirt also works with fine knits that, in new proportions of short and
long, are the easiest way to achieve soft layers.
The shirt now goes under a skinny, cropped sweater instead of over. On top
goes another autumn essential which, in some version, you probably already
have - the waistcoat. In this case the trendy floor-length knitted gilet
with short brocade or velvet ones are part of the dandy look.
Layered with chunky wool or tweed, they contribute to the unexpected
texture-mix, revolving round velvet, which is the buyers' hot tip for
mid-winter.
Day time velvet divides the buyers. Some see it as too much identified with
evening; others feel that, contrasted with rugged tweed, wool and even
leather it makes sense, but cotton velvet is better for day than sheeny,
soft silk velvet. The velvet jacket is, in many eyes, essential this autumn.
The favoured silhouette is gently A-line, narrow-shouldered and flaring to
the hem, even for jackets which, despite gilets and long dresses, are still
the working woman's mainstay. What to put with them?
Wide trousers or a long, softly flaring skirt are the buyers' choices, while
last year's jodhpurs are still good for dandies. Over the layers goes the
contrast of a big coat - fitted, flared and military-style or plain,
voluminous and often not buttoned at all.
Lastly there are the essential accessories which can be the cheapest way to
update. Lace-up boots rise higher up your leg the more fashion forward you
are. Other trappings are floppy velvet hats or felt toppers, velvet scarves,
jet beads, chunky amber, crosses of all kinds and a bag much softer than the
ubiquitous gilt-chained square.
We asked each of our consultant buyers to summarise their favourite look and
suggest one essential autumn purchase:
Josephine Turner, A la Mode, London SW1: 'The look is long, light,
body-skimming layers in mixed velvet, cashmere, chiffon and suede - not
traditional daywear fabrics but everything should double for evening. Best
buy is a huge coat, to keep you warm and to hide those unusual fabrics while
you're out'.
Francoise Tessier, Browns, London W1: 'Layering and unusual fabric
combinations are my choice. Soft, long, flaring knits under a gilet or
jacket with a similar shape are easy and flattering. Fine or rib-knitted
pieces are essentials'.
Joseph Ettedgui, Joseph shops: 'The classics are a soft cardigan, a white
shirt, wide and narrow pants, a big coat. Then mix in the fashion pieces
like a dandy jacket so the textures are interesting. Velvet is great but a
long velvet dress should only be for evening. One essential is soft, loose
trousers, in black or deep brown'.
Amanda Verdan, Harvey Nichols, London SW1: 'The look is much softer,
deconstructed and very plain. Dandy velvet or jewellery in amber, silver or
jet add the fun. The best buy jacket is narrow-shouldered, long and gently
wider at the hem.'
Rita Britton, Pollyanna, Barnsley: 'Layers look simple but are easy to get
wrong. They should be light, fine and fluid, especially the bottom half, and
mix the neutrals - black, brown and grey - together. The contrast is in
chunky, emphatic shoes. One buy is boots, lace-up ankle or biker style'.
Anne Pitcher, Harrods, London SW1: 'The essential pieces are velvet, knits
and anything long and fluid. This can be tough for business-wear but knits
under soft cardigans work well. Velvet for day is very new, mixed with
tweed. A velvet shirt is extremely versatile'.
Lucille Lewin, Whistles shops: 'I am mad about velvet for day, mixed as
outrageously as you want. Your first buy should be a white shirt if you
don't own one and then a velvet jacket. Selina Blow's is definitive -
expensive but you can wear it with anything'.
Cathy Harris, Fenwick, London W1: 'It is easy to update inexpensively.
Waistcoats layered long over short in different fabrics are good for mixed
textures. A velvet scarf, long beads and a cross, a white shirt and lace-up
boots are good buys'.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Dining on disappointment - Nicholas Lander on
why meals in hotel dining rooms may fail to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS that Bruno Loubet, the talented chef at the Four Seasons Hotel,
Hyde Park, London is to leave at the end of this month only confirmed one of
the London restaurant trade's most widespread rumours.
Loubet, it is now suggested, will be opening a large brasserie somewhere in
the West End early next year. This follows a fashion set by some of the top
chefs and restaurateurs in Paris who are fighting the recession with
lower-priced restaurants: two-star Michelin chef Michel Rostang owns Bistro
d' a Cote, his counterpart, Jacques Cagna, owns Rotisserie d'en Face while
Claude Terrail, proprietor of the three-star Tour d'Argent, presides over La
Rotisserie du Beaujolais.
But Loubet's departure from the world of Michelin-starred restaurants and
the grand hotel dining room, however temporary, may be a result of something
more significant.
Loubet was brought to London four years ago by the hotel's general manager,
Ramon Pajares, in what was considered a stroke of entrepreneurial genius. In
the mid-1980s hotels and restaurants were flourishing and hotel concierges
were often pleading for restaurant tables on their guests' behalf. The
solution seemed to be to upgrade hotel restaurants, in many cases neglected
for the past 20 years, and entice hotel guests to eat in.
New chefs were hired, small fortunes were spent on kitchen and restaurant
redesign and hundreds of press releases were despatched. I believed it would
be successful: the hotels seemed to have found a winning formula and could,
given the income generated by their rooms and banqueting operations, more
than match restaurants on price.
However, the whole venture has proved a costly mistake. They were not helped
by the timing. Just as the enterprise was given its final polish the Gulf
War broke out, business and tourist travel declined and recession set in.
Also with one or two exceptions, hotel dining rooms have failed to deliver.
The vacant tables at lunch and dinner have also reflected a poor product
mix, poor marketing and an inadequate understanding of what the general
public is looking for. Over the last six months many restaurants have shown
that careful pricing can fill their tables and leave the hotel dining rooms
empty.
I have eaten in and and been disappointed by a depressingly long list of
hotel dining rooms this year: The Connaught, The Lanesborough, The Grosvenor
House, The Langham Hilton, The Dorchester, and The Halkin.
Criticisms include: a main course risotto that was served lukewarm, an
unexciting series of dishes that made up a meal that cost Pounds 210 for
three, a Chinese meal that looked good but tasted bland and another that,
mistakenly, masked the flavour of ingredients with cream. One hotel dining
room was chilly, even in late June, and our conversation was hampered by a
perpetual piano player and a mini-waterfall.
There are some standard reasons given for these disappointments: the manager
of a 300-bedroom hotel does not necessarily have the requisite skills to run
a 50-seater restaurant; hotel dining rooms, often serving four different
meals a day, are nearly always impersonal, particularly if they do not have
a separate entrance, and therefore identity, from the hotel; and restaurant
wine lists can be outrageously expensive.
London's hotel managers have courted big name chefs but neglected to staff
the front-of-house with people of the same calibre or personality. They have
failed to promote enough women to positions of importance in their dining
rooms, so perpetuating an often supercilious attitude, particularly towards
the female diner.
Their biggest omission has been in marketing, in spite of the constant
stream of press releases and invitations. Four years ago, instead of joining
to promote eating in London's hotel dining rooms, the hotels decided to
fight each other as well as the restaurants. There was no generic
advertising or marketing campaign, although the funds must surely have been
available. A few hotels did create their own dining card with discounts for
frequent diners but they never launched a 'hotel dine around card' that
could have tempted non-residents to cross the lobby.
London's hotel managers have let slip a golden opportunity. The dining rooms
of our big hotels should be a shop window for the hotels themselves and
stiff competition for the best of our restaurants. But at the moment there
is no contest.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Grand old men of wine - Jancis Robinson meets
two mature but undervalued experts on wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO grandest, oldest men of wine prove that drinking fine wine may make
you live longer, but is unlikely to make you rich.
Harry Waugh, born 1904, was one of the mould-breaking British wine merchants
of the 1950s and 1960s. He helped introduce a little- known wine called
Petrus to Britain, encouraged the entirely new phenomenon of domaine
bottling in Burgundy, and was singing the praises of California wine about a
decade before anyone else outside the state.
He left Harveys of Bristol in 1966, when it was bought by Showerings, of
Babycham fame, but retained his directorship of the Bordeaux first growth
Chateau Latour and a pension which did not take account of either inflation
or the fact that he was to become a father, of twins, seven years later.
At Harveys he trained many of the most famously successful men in today's
wine trade, including, ironically enough, the chairman of Allied-Lyons which
has just sold Latour back into French, determinedly French, hands, thereby
leaving the wine trade's most respected figure, a hale, straight-backed 89
year-old, in urgent need of a financial manager. Step up, Mark McCormack
Born in Moscow, three years earlier than Harry Waugh in 1901, Andre
Tchelistcheff is an even more remarkable fellow. After surviving severe
illness in childhood, and a particularly bloody campaign in the White
Russian army in his teens, he trained in agriculture in Czechoslovakia and
Paris and specialised in wine only at the age of 36, when he was recruited
to impart 'Frenchness', including the technical probity of Pasteur, to
Beaulieu Vineyards in California. He could have gone to China instead, like
his best friend who became Minister of Agriculture there after Mao.
Instead, this intelligent scientist-philosopher has come to be regarded as
the father of modern California wine. He pioneered cool fermentation,
controlling malolactic fermentation, developed the anti-frost damage wind
machines that are such a visible feature of the Napa Valley to this day, and
has been consultant at scores of wineries both in America and Europe.
At 92 he has just completed a six-week tour of European winemaking friends
and vineyards, which he describes as 'education'. This was supposed to be
his last trip to Europe, but his wife, Dorothy, overheard him volunteering
at Burgundy's Domaine de la Romanee-Conti to take up an apprenticeship next
year.
Only someone with near divine knowledge would claim such ignorance. With the
look (including hairstyle) and stature of an impish prep school boy, Andre
Tchelistcheff 's understanding of the wine world is still acute,
well-informed, and often unexpected. In a soft, still heavily accented
voice, he presents perhaps the only analysis of the wine world that has ever
been based on such a long history and such a wide geographical purview.
Acknowledging the demands of the technically curious but impatient modern
wine consumer, he observes, for example, that: 'Wines are naked at the
moment. And this is a good thing because it is good to show one's
deficencies. Little by little winemakers will learn what the consumer wants
of his wines and will begin to reclothe them. Pumping over the grape must is
the key.' Andre Tchelistcheff believes that wines will never again be
designed expressly for long ageing in bottle.
He is also blunt about the phylloxera vine pest currently destroying a good
part of the northern California vineyard: 'It's the grape growers' fault.
They chose to plant a rootstock they knew did not have good phylloxera
resistance.'
His palate is as keen as ever, although he drinks sparingly, sparing his
frail knees in particular. He must have been one of the few visitors to have
done a three-day stint at this year's Vinexpo, Bordeaux's notoriously
exhausting international wine exhibition, and certainly the only
nonogenarian to walk the full length of the exhibition hall. Dorothy, whose
arm enabled the feat, heard many a hissed 'that's Andre Tchelistcheff' as
they made their progress, presumably from one grandson of an old associate
to the next.
One of the consultancies which has thrilled him most has been with Chateau
Ste Michelle, of Washington state, where he believes there may be greater
potential than California. He is still quoted, admired, and decorated amid
much ballyhoo when it suits the decorators (although as far as he is
concerned, it is presumably difficult to better the Chevalier du Merite
Agricole awarded by the French as early as 1954 for his part in Frenchifying
the American wine industry).
Considering his input to the world's ritziest wine industry, Andre
Tchelistcheff lives modestly, has never had a wine cellar of his own, and
seems to have encountered more difficulties during his six-week tour of
Europe than one would think fit for an eminent 92-year-old.
One blow was a letter from Lodovico Antinori, of Ornellaia in Tuscany,
maintaining that he could no longer afford the services of the consultant
whose name appears in so much of his promotional literature.
Then there was the fact that they spent their first night in Britain last
month in the newly-opened Ibis hotel at Heathrow. We should have organised a
troika with outriders and given them, and Harry Waugh and his wife, the run
of the grand new Vintners' Place development overlooking the Thames.

A SHARE reduction in the price of grapes for the coming vintage, agreed by
Champagne merchants and growers, reflects their continuing stock and sales
problems. Prices are from Ffr24 (Pounds 2.73) a kilo for the top districts
on the Montagne de Reims and the Cote des Blancs, to Ffr20.5 and from Ffr20
to Ffr16.4 in the lesser districts in the Marn and Aube.
Moreover the maximum permitted yield of grapes per hectare for appellation
champagne has been cut to 10.400 kilos, with 2,000 kilos of these blocked as
still wine until lowered stock levels permit their second, sparkling
fermentation. Over-stocked merchants were hoping for a significantly lower
maximum yield per ha, so the agreed figure favours growers who make their
own champagne. But the lower price will make possible lower-cost wines.
Following in the footsteps of rivals Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and
Sainsbury's, Tesco is now offering wine by mail order, at prices that
represent a discount of at least five per cent on shelf prices. Nine
sensible cases have been put together, at Pounds 33 to Pounds 54 a dozen.
Delivery of one case costs Pounds 3.50, but is free for two cases to one
address. More information, not from Tesco stores but on 091-416-5138
weekdays 9am to 9pm.
It is also well worth ordering two cases from the Bin End Sale of Justerini
&amp; Brooks (071-493 8721 in London and 031-226 4202 in Edinburgh). They charge
Pounds 9 delivery of a single case but nothing at all for delivering two,
and the sale, which closes on October 15, is of unsplit cases only. By no
means everything is a bargain, but there are useful halves.
Anyone who was interested in buying bonds in the new Arran distillers, as
reported in the last Weekend FT, might be interested to learn that the
quantities of whisky offered for Pounds 450 are 10 cases of Lochranza
blended whisky in 1998 and 10 cases of the real thing - Arran malt - in
2001. My apologies for suggesting that only one case of each was offered.
Also British Telecom has changed the company's telephone and fax numbers.
These are now 0290-552282 and 0290-550177 respectively.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Cookery: Marriage made in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AULD alliance may still be going strong but Scotland is forging new
bonds with Spain. This gastronomic union was celebrated recently with a
banquet at Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, near Cairndow in Argyll.
The Spaniards brought nearly two dozen fine sherries, ranging from Sanlucar
manzanilla, with its salty fresh tang, to the super-rich syrup-of-figs slurp
of a well aged Pedro Ximenez.
The Scottish team produced a magnificent array of fish and shellfish
(including velvet crabs, creel-caught langoustines, oysters, queen scallops,
eel, fresh, hot- and cold-smoked salmon, and herrings marinated in various
ways), smoked and marinated venison, a few cheeses and desserts.
The idea was that the guests, a handful of food and wine writers, should act
as marriage brokers trying to forge the best partnerships between the foods
and the wines.
The party assembled the evening before the banquet was due to take place,
meeting and staying at Ardkinglas, John Noble's imposing Lorimer pile on the
fringes of Loch Fyne. I had not been there since my teens, but nothing
seemed to have changed.
We arrived in typically Scottish weather: a fine drizzle which later gave
way to a watery sun veiled by gauzy mist. The welcome was warm and generous
with massive log fires and piping hot bath water the colour of whisky.
And the mood was jolly as we sat down to the inaugural dinner. An auspicious
start to the feastings, this included lobster, three-year-old wether mutton
from the estate and several bottles of Cune Rioja Imperial Gran Riserva
1975. Do not look for this vintage in the shops: we drank the last of it.
If, however, you press me to tell you what I enjoyed most, it was breakfast.
This was a full-scale affair, not the paltry sassernach offering of
cornflakes and toast.
Before we retired for the night we had each been given a breakfast menu.
'Please tick those items you would like: porridge, fresh grapefruit juice,
fresh orange juice, Loch Fyne kippers, Finnan haddock, eggs (poached,
scrambled, fried or boiled), black pudding, Ayrshire bacon, pork sausage,
grilled tomato, mushrooms, home-made bread and girdle scones.'
Most of us could not resist ticking almost all of these items. And we were
right to. The citrus juice, which was freshly squeezed by the master of the
house himself in the pantry alongside the dining room, came by the jugful.
The girdle scones and bread lived up to the Scottish reputation for fine
baking. The bacon was frazzled and flavoursome, not weeping pathetically.
The kippers were excellent and the Finnan haddock, which I watched our host
and his niece poach in milk, was the best I have ever eaten.
FINNAN HADDOCK MOUSSE (serves 8)
Three fish will yield more flesh than is needed for this recipe. Use the
surplus, depending on how much of it there is, to make a creamy fish soup,
omelette Arnold Bennett or kedgeree.
If you are nimble-fingered and want to dramatise the look of the mousse, you
can decorate the sides of it, after unmoulding, with a 'fence' of lightly
steamed and cooled French beans, sticking them into place with a light smear
of mayonnaise or fromage frais. A shallow bowl with sloping sides makes a
better mould than a straight sided souffle dish for this purpose.
3 finnan haddocks; 1 1/2 pt creamy milk; 1 carrot; 1 shallot; 2 bay leaves;
1 1/2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz plain flour; 3 tablespoons manzanilla or fino
sherry; approximately 1 tablespoon gelatine powder (see method); 2 1/2 -3 fl
oz single cream; 2 egg whites; 6 black peppercorns and a little cayenne
pepper.
Choose a pan that will hold the fish snugly. Put into it the milk, chopped
shallot, carrot, bay leaves and peppercorns and bring slowly to scalding
point. Add the fish, pushing it down into the liquid, and top up if
necessary with just enough water to cover the fish. Bring back to simmering
point, switch off the heat, cover the pan and leave for 10 minutes.
Strain the liquid from the smoked haddock and use  3/4 pt of it, together
with the butter and flour, to make a fishy flavoured bechamel sauce. Add the
sherry and 1 lb of the skinned and flaked haddock. Simmer, uncovered, over a
heat-diffuser for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile soak then dissolve in 3-4 tablespoons of the leftover fishy milk
some gelatine (1 1/2 tablespoons of gelatine if the mousse is to be
unmoulded; less if the mousse is to be served in the dish in which it is
set).
Away from the hob, stir the melted gelatine thoroughly into the fish. Add
the cream and season with cayenne, black pepper and salt to taste. Turn the
mixture into a large bowl and set it aside until cold and beginning to
thicken. Then whisk the egg whites, fold them into the mousse and spoon it
into a souffle dish or bowl or individual ramekins. Cover and chill until
set.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: Four favourites in a bright season - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE enjoyed this season's county cricket. The four-day game seems to me
to have been a success, producing more close finishes and varied bowling
than the three-day game, which had become stale and, all too often,
contrived.
In some ways this has been a summer of the unexpected, with regard to both
counties and players. I had not guessed that Glamorganshire would end up
fighting Worcestershire for second place in the county table. And in picking
the four county cricketers whose play I have most enjoyed this summer, I am
making up for my lack of perspicacity by leaving out the obvious top
performers, such as Graham Gooch and Curtly Ambrose, in favour of four who
have surprised as well as delighted.
Surrey's Joseph Benjamin, for instance, has improved beyond recognition,
without being overshadowed by Waqar Younis and Martin Bicknell in an
exceptionally strong bowling attack. By mixing swingers and cutters in with
full length balls he has established his weaponry.
Surrey have just given Benjamin his county cap, which he well deserves. He
bowls very fast medium, with unpredictable, sharp bounce. His 62 county
wickets so far this season have been a bit expensive, but were often taken
when the batsmen were deeply entrenched. He adds a touch of toughness to
Surrey's efforts.
Released at the end of 1991 by Warwickshire, after three disappointing years
there, he has come into his own at the age of 32, at a county that is
inclined to come and go without really getting anywhere. He has learnt to be
a cricketing realist.
John Emburey, I am sure, was born a realist. He is a 41-year old perennial
from Peckham, proud of having learnt his cricket on the streets and having
played it with Middlesex for the past 20 years. Emburey is not the kind of
full-flighted, aggressive spinner I most like to watch, but his tireless,
rather flat off-spin is economical. It often frustrates batsmen into
surrendering their wickets by trying to hit their way out of stagnation.
So far, 223 of his 708 overs have been maidens and he has taken 68 wickets.
At the top end of the averages, only Mushtaq Ahmed and Steve Watkin have
taken more.
Emburey is not defensive, but he attacks carefully. He has worked out an
effective bowling partnership with Philip Tufnell, Middlesex's much younger,
more resourceful and more temperamental off-spinner. His batting is better
than Tufnell's - most cricketers qualify for that accolade. His 55 not out
in the first innings of the Edgbaston Test was a resolute display of his
speciality, sweetly described by Christopher Martin-Jenkins on the radio as
'letting the ball hit him on the bat'. Once or twice this season for
Middlesex it has hit him prodigiously hard, as on the way to his recent 120
against Northamptonshire.
It is always possible that Emburey has one more trick up his sleeve, which
makes him a great team asset. Team values tend to be under-rated nowadays,
as individual achievement is emphasised and often judged apart from the
co-ordinated achievements of the team.
Wicket-keepers are the least prone to this because they are the pivots of
all the activities on the field, completing the course of the bowling,
preying on the batting and catching the whole fanfare of fielders' throws
into the stumps. A good keeper boosts team morale, which is why Robert
'Jack' Russell is so valued at Gloucester.
Russell has long been a good and cheerful keeper, never tired of trying to
improve. He is in the Alan Knott style: slight, bouncy, alert, close to the
stumps and at times airborne in the course of duty. He has only ever played
county cricket for Gloucestershire, his home county, a striking
demonstration of loyalty.
Gloucestershire are in hard times at present but Russell's outstanding
quality, as always, is his determination. No-one has ever accused him of
being half-hearted. In his last county game, at Taunton, he stumped Adrianus
van Troost, Somerset's Dutch speed merchant, for nought, off the young
off-spinner Martyn Ball, though Somerset were in the 380s and
Gloucestershire were tired.
If Russell was tired, he did not show it. It was one of seven stumpings and
50 catches he had taken since the season began, an impressive tally. I was
given the figures from Russell's cricketing diary, in which he records
details of every match he plays.
Derbyshire's John Morris, far from keeping a cricketing diary awash with
statistics, told me he did not know how many runs he had scored this season
(1,439, at an average of 55). He belongs to the more stately school of
cricket, remote from figures and fitness regimes, unlikely to drink 20 cups
of tea or run six miles a day, as Russell does.
Like many naturally talented batsmen, Morris sometimes plays with an air of
taking his triumphs for granted, although they are always powerful. His
recent 127 against Surrey, in which he warmed up with a six back over
Younis's head and right out of the playing area at Derby, was a savage
example of this. Younis was quickly taken off. Morris carried on hitting as
though he was enjoying an afternoon off work.
He is a majestic batsman, hooking and driving freely, particularly relishing
fast bowling that rushes on to the bat in search of punishment. With batsmen
like Morris concentration is liable to lapse when faced with dull or
undemanding bowling. He has had some poor games for Derbyshire this summer,
but has had some grand ones too and is more consistent than he used to be.
I like Morris's batting because it has a touch of grandeur seldom seen in
modern cricket. His fielding is of the sort more often seen in older
cricket, before the South Africans brought speed and efficiency to the field
in the 1960s. He has improved, but still gives the impression that rather
than sprinting to stop the ball, he would do better to let it find rest in
his body.
The real devastation will come with bat, not ball, in hand.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: The art of the bribe - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS MATYSZCZYK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN Europe you just don't do it very well do you?' said my fat Malay friend,
barely suppressing a laugh. 'You have to be clever, and your football
administrators clearly aren't'
He was referring neither to team selection nor ticket sales. Instead, what
is making so many involved in south-east Asian football, so many who sit up
all night to watch any kind of match beamed from the West, curl up in
chuckles, are the match-fixing scandals in Marseille, Warsaw and Tbilisi.
My friend, who has regularly profited from knowing the score of a big game
some 24 hours before it kicks off, explained: 'First of all, officials
cannot be seen to be involved. And the people who always benefit most are
the bookies. So you let the bookies do the work and, if you are friends with
at least one of them, you reap the benefits.'
The work, as he so delicately calls bribery, is quite complicated. You do
not, explained the rather attractive daughter of a bookie, allow a player to
bury money in your in-laws' back garden. This is what Christophe Robert, of
Valenciennes widely reported to have done with the Ffr242,000 he allegedly
received from the unfortunate Jean-Jacques Eydelie of Marseille. If you can
help it, you do not pay cash at all. No one, least of all a footballer, a
species not known for intellectual grandeur, should put himself in the
position of having to explain a sudden accretion in his bank account.
Instead, a south-east Asian bookie will buy all tickets they know are going
to win in the local four-digit lottery - and then give them to the players.
The money is therefore legitimately gained.
He will organise the renovation of, or better still, the down payment for, a
nice little four-bedroomed house. He will buy the player a car, several
overseas holidays or a small yacht. Rolex watches and Bally shoes are prized
commodities, particularly when given to each member of a player's vast
extended family.
But before he puts his hand in his pocket, the astute bookie will consider
very carefully which player or players (or referees) to approach and how the
match is to be fixed.
The less sophisticated might expect a lugubrious defender to score an
embarrassing own goal or even pass the ball, inadvertently, to an opposing
forward. The expert bribee is more inventive. He will fail to cut out a
cross. He will find himself subtly out of position. Or, and this is the
favourite strategy in south-east Asian football at the moment, he will only
play well for one half.
Usually, there are three or four players on the take in a game. They are the
most talented on their respective team.
'You get the best striker, the two best defender and the goalkeeper and
you've got the game,' a Singaporean journalist told me. 'You do not contact
them directly. Instead you use relatives and girl friends. You then plant
runners in the hotel where the players are staying. They are there just to
make sure the player knows the bookie is serious. And if a chosen player
starts being difficult, you have to make a few threats. Nothing too serious.
Just a severe beating, maybe smashing his car up or threatening his family.
If a a player succumbs once, he is in the hands of the bookies for good.'
Rather like Sunday afternoon golfers, south-east Asian gamblers love to
wager on the first-half score and a second-half score separately, and then
the match as a whole. This has opened a wonderful new arena for the bookies.
For example, if Singapore Rovers are expected to beat Singapore Rangers
easily and the bookies have taken a lot of bets at generous odds on a
lop-sided half-time score, Rovers might have a terribly unfortunate 45
minutes in front of goal before destroying Rangers in the second half. At
slightly less advantageous odds, of course.
According to Peter Velappan, secretary-general of the Asian Football
Confederation, some SDollars 200,000 (Pounds 80,000) of bookie benefits were
available at every match in the Southeast Asian Games in June: 'The
syndicates in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bangkok have combined
their resources to make it a professional set-up, a multi-national
corporation with no permanent headquarters. I was once quite shocked to
receive a report about a youth team, all its members under 15, carting away
TVs, video players, radios and stereo sets, after losing 12-0 in an
international youth competition.
'I have not come across an FA in this region which has looked this problem
squarely in the face. So it is now not surprising that it has spread to
parts of South Korea and parts of south China.'
Velappan knows how difficult it is to prevent, in spite of the efforts of th
Football Association of Singapore, for example, which has employed plain
clotheses policemen to investigate suspects and forbids players to use the
telephone for the last six hours before a game.
Once bribery becomes an institution, with proof impossible to grasp, it is
difficult to prevent. That is the real danger for European football.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Sport: An upset in the ratings game - US Open Tennis / TV's
'Super Saturday' in New York has been ruined by Cedric Pioline, Alexander
Volkov and Wally Masur. John Barrett, for one, is pleased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN without the 11 players who retired, defaulted or otherwise withdrew,
the 25th US Championships of the open era have provided enough on-court
shocks among the men to be sub-titled 'Slaughter on 10th Avenue.' No
Gershwin melody ever sounded as sweet to Cedric Pioline and Magnus Larsson,
unlikely heroes from France and Sweden, who beat respectively the top seed
and world No 1 Jim Courier, and the 1989 champion Boris Becker, seeded No 4.
These two upsets shook the tennis establishment and sent a chill through the
CBS television network whose prime time coverage of today's semi-finals will
be Cedric Pioline, the No 15 seed, versus the unseeded Australian Wally
Masur, and Alexander Volkov of Russia against the Pete Sampras of the US,
the No 2 seed. This is hardly what CBS had planned for 'Super-Saturday', an
annual day of disgrace in the tennis calendar when the women's singles final
is sandwiched between the two men's semi-finals. The winning men playing
their final the following day.
Accordingly I have little sympathy for the officials who put ratings before
their responsibility to the performers and the paying public. I cannot think
of another leading sport where the finalists do not know when they will
compete. As for the men having no day of rest before the final, this is
unfair on them. I well remember the fiasco in 1985 when John McEnroe won a
magnificent five-set battle against Mats Wilander. It was brutally hot and
humid and McEnroe was exhausted. The following day, against Ivan Lendl, who
had easily beaten Jimmy Connors, McEnroe slid tamely to defeat. With a day's
rest we might have had the final we deserved.
Yet there is a simple answer. If the championships were moved one week
earlier the final weekend would coincide with Labor Day. The two men's semis
would be played on the Saturday, the women's singles and men's doubles on
the Sunday and the men's singles and mixed doubles on the holiday Monday.
This simple solution will doubtless be sacrificed to TV schedules - in other
words, money. A pity this, because the income of the USTA would not be
seriously threatened by laying down the conditions for the bidding networks.
In any case one must question the wisdom of increasing the prize money so
sharply. There really was no pressure from the players or anyone else to
raise it from Dollars 8,210,200 last year to Dollars 9,022,000 this (more
than double the 1988 total).
Night play is another example of commercial exploitation taking precedence
over sporting fairness. The US Open, like the Australian Open, is two
tournaments: one played in daylight, the other under lights. There have been
players, such as Bjorn Borg, who simply could not see as well at night. His
plea not to play Roscoe Tanner, the fast serving American left-hander, at
night in 1979 was ignored. Borg lost. Cynics suggested that national
interest had overridden impartiality.
The foolish scheduling this year, which spread the first round singles
matches over three days instead of two, caught up with the organisers when
rain prevented Becker from playing more than two points of his night match
against Andrei Cherkasov on the first Wednesday. Further rain interrupted
the conclusion on Thursday as Becker struggled back to win 6-4 in the fifth.
Now, to win the tournament, he would have had to survive six best-of-five
set matches in 10 days, a totally avoidable situation. Fatigue was certainly
a contributory factor as a jaded Becker eventually lost to Larsson.
Yes, there has been some controversy this year but there have also been some
impressive performances from other relative newcomers such as Andrei
Medvedev, Richard Krajicek and Todd Martin. Certainly today's athletic young
giants are bigger and stronger on average than players were 20 years ago.
With their powerful graphite rackets they have produced an impressive
match-winning formula. Yet, wonderful as it was to see Sampras cutting down
his boyhood nemesis Michael Chang so impressively on Wednesday - a 6-7 7-6
6-1 6-1 victory of accelerating expertise - there were few rallies to
admire. Today's technique is based on pace rather than placement, on power
instead of finesse. Quick winners are the order of the day.
None of this would have been possible with the old smaller-headed wooden
rackets. Any attempt to hit the ball really hard without perfect stroke
production would have led to error and, even if it had gone in, the ball
would not have travelled as fast as it does today. In those days there was a
premium on skill. The champions of the wooden era hit the ball in the middle
of the racket more often than their challengers and could exploit tactical
superiority. Strength and fitness alone were no guarantee of success.
Masur, who arrived somewhat fortunately in the semi-finals for the first
time (he was 0-5 down in the final set of his fourth round match against
fellow Aussie Jamie Morgan), said: 'I am not a power tennis player. I don't
serve at 125 mph and crack my forehand. I usually have to hit two or three
shots to win a point. That is probably because I was brought up playing with
a wooden racket. These days some of the guys don't construct points because
they don't have to. They have got the ability to virtually win it from
anywhere on the court.'
It would be interesting to stage a tournament among today's top players with
wooden rackets. We might be surprised by the results. I guarantee that we
would find it more entertaining.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Motoring: Gloom outside the showroom - Frankfurt show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE Frankfurt's monster exhibition complex the skies are dark for
Germany's car makers. Inside, the sparkling, larger-than-life 55th
international motor show goes on.
Britain's car industry is currently enjoying a minor boom, making and
selling about 8 per cent more cars than this time last year.
It is a different story across the Channel though. In Germany, Europe's
largest new car market, sales are 21 per cent down. Spain (a 29 per cent
drop) and Italy (26 per cent) are worse off and France (17 per cent) not
much better.
German car makers are trimming their sails to reduce production costs.
Volkswagen has eliminated 20,000 jobs this year, with more still to go, and
is telling component suppliers to cut their prices. Mercedes-Benz is to cut
23,000 jobs next year to save Pounds 125m - its earnings fell 45 per cent in
1992.
Critics have said Mercedes cars - particularly the large and luxurious
S-Class - are out of tune with recessionary times. That may be so but the
S-Class is arguably the world's best big car. I drove a newly-introduced
budget version with a 2.8-litre engine to Frankfurt for the show. More of
this - and of the show itself - next week.
The only good thing about being first into a recession is that, with any
luck, you are first out of it. Britain's main worry is that some of the
steam has gone out of its exports to EC countries - Peugeots, Toyotas,
Hondas and Nissans as well as Fords, Vauxhalls and, of course, Rovers and
Land Rovers - because of the sharp fall in mainland European car sales.
But the gloom is forgotten inside the Frankfurt show. It remains the German
motor industry's shop window. Among the most interesting exhibits are two
German concept cars, the tiny Mercedes-Benz Vision A 93 and the Audi ASF.
Mercedes calls the Vision a serious design study for a new class of car it
intends to launch after 1995. Only 3.35m (11ft 2in) long, this high-roofed
five-door looks like a city centre car but is also meant for serious
driving. It is surprisingly roomy because the engine, a super-economical
3-cylinder direct-injection diesel, is tucked away under the floor. Audi's
ASF - for aluminium space frame - concept is a 10-year joint effort with
Alcoa (Aluminium Company of America). Aluminium has a lot going for it. An
aluminium space-frame body shell is 40 per cent lighter than one pressed
from steel sheet.
This is important because 70 per cent of total fuel consumption is reckoned
to be influenced directly by vehicle weight. All new models seem to be
heavier than those they have replaced because customers want greater safety
and more luxury equipment.
Making a car largely from aluminium would reverse this unwelcome trend. An
ASF car is also said to be safer to crash in, easier to repair and to have a
longer potential life because aluminium corrodes slowly. As a bonus,
aluminium can be melted down and used again almost indefinitely, saving
natural resources.
The power unit proposed for ASF, which is a four-door luxury saloon, is a
3.4-litre direct-injection diesel derived from the current Audi V8's engine.
The big ASF saloon will not go into production though Audi says it could.
But another ASF-bodied Audi car is due to go on sale next year after making
a debut at Geneva Show in March.
Ford, too, has an all-aluminium concept car, the Synthesis 2010, at
Frankfurt, but the lightweight aluminium family car in the Escort, Golf or
Astra class is still many years away. Chrysler has become so serious about
the European market, in which it sold nearly 29,000 cars from January-June,
that it broke its habits of a lifetime and chose a European show as launch
pad for its new Neon compact saloon. Neon, a graceful four-door, goes on
sale on mainland Europe next summer. Chrysler is not ruling out a right-hand
drive version for Britain, where its Jeeps have sold well this year.
Also making a debut at Frankfurt is the Chrysler Vision saloon, 3.5-litre V6
engined, with combined traction control and anti-lock brakes. It has had
rave reviews in the US and looks as if it might make some conquests as a
Ford Scorpio or Opel Senator alternative when it reaches European (not
British) dealers soon.
Mazda unveiled at Frankfurt the Xedos 9, a car it hopes will bring no joy to
BMW or Mercedes dealers when it arrives in Germany in the near future and
the rest of Europe, Britain included, early in 1944. Xedos is an upmarket
brand, Mazda's equivalent of Toyota's Lexus.
The new car has V6 engines of 2.0-litres or 2.5 litres capacity. Four-wheel
steering is an option and electronic traction control standard on the
2.5-litre model. Peugeot's pretty Pininfarina-styled 306 cabriolet makes a
Frankfurt world premiere; this rival for the new VW Golf cabriolet has a
power operated hood and, like the Golf, comes to Britain in early 1994.
Already on sale but making their first show appearances are the
Mercedes-Benz C-Class, a sleeker, roomier successor to the best-selling 190,
and the new Saab 900, in every way a better car than the old one. Frankfurt
is not just the largest and most important European motor show but the most
exhausting to visit.
In spite of its airy modern buildings and moving walkways, it demands
dedication, comfortable shoes and time. Do not even think of trying to see
it all in a single day. Just as a train from Euston or a tube to Earls Court
are the only cost-effective forms of transport to our own Birmingham and
London shows, a tram from the main station to the exhibition halls makes
best sense at Frankfurt. There has to be a moral somewhere.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Travel: The past lives on for old romantics - Nicholas
Woodsworth potters around Malacca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY westerners, I tend to an over-romantic view of the east, writes
Nicholas Woodsworth. I should know better. We live in the 1990s and the
wonders of the Orient are less wonderful than formerly. Yet hope springs
eternal.
Malacca, in Malaysia, is one of those Asian places with an irresistible
name, and, speeding towards it along the motorway from the skyscrapers of
Kuala Lumpur, I began creating a fabulous city. Certainly the literature I
had collected on Malacca did nothing to dissuade me. I can always spot a
guidebook author who has the same romantic infirmity as I: long lists of
exotic trade-goods are a giveaway.
As I stepped from the bus into tropical rain, hotel touts proffered handfuls
of limp pamphlets. I stalked off. I could find historic splendour on my own.
Two hours later, weary and defeated, I checked into a dingy hotel.
It was the nearest thing I could find to historic splendour. Malacca seemed
to have become a backwater, a forgotten town perched on the edge of a
somnolent coast. There was nothing but the rain on the roof and the revving
of car engines from the auto repair shop on the far side of the street.
At the waterfront, where a narrow and muddy river flows into the Straits of
Malacca, I watched mud-skippers flop about in the ooze of low tide.
On St Paul's Hill, overlooking the banks of the river, I wandered about a
16th century church built by the Portuguese at the beginning of their
130-year rule of Malacca. Roofless and doorless, it, too, has been
abandoned. Even the tomb of St Francis Xavier has been emptied and the body
of the great Jesuit reinterred in Goa.
Malacca depressed me. Even Christ Church, a splendid red Dutch building
later appropriated by the British, was sad. It was full of lugubrious marble
plaques commemorating entire English families decimated by tropical disease.
There was history in Malacca's old buildings, but it all seemed dead and
forsaken. Wandering back to my hotel through a grey drizzle, I began to
think of moving down the coast to that bright temple of modernism,
Singapore.
But I did not. Instead, on a street corner, I bumped into a Malaccan who
showed me that the past is not just abandoned churches and fortresses. I had
been looking in the wrong place.
I met Roland Lee outside his home, began chatting, and ended up staying
there for several days. His house sits not far from the river on the town's
old Heeren Street, a narrow road once inhabited by Malacca's Dutch notables.
It seems ordinary enough. From the outside lacquered family name-plaques in
Chinese script are the only distinguishing features of these terraced
houses. Walk inside, though, and you walk into a story 500 years old.
British, Dutch and Portuguese can all claim long traditions here, but
Roland's pedigree outdoes them all. A Peranakan, or Straits-born Chinese,
his family was settled in Malacca 200 years before the first Europeans set
foot there.
The Chinese, wherever they immigrate in Asia, rarely marry outside their own
community. Those who came to the Malaysian peninsula in the late 1800s to
work the British tin mines and rubber plantations, and now number some 5m,
are good examples.
But the Peranakans are different. When Chinese merchants arrived in Malacca
in the 1400s they came without wives or families. Trade was so good they
settled; they took Malayan wives. The mixing of two peoples of almost
diametrically opposed character - one hard-working and profit-oriented, the
other non-materialist and other-worldly - gave rise to a peculiar culture: a
wealthy and influential business community with a love of sensual things.
Today the Peranakans of Malacca have fallen behind Malaysia's ethnic Chinese
in the race for prosperity, but they have not given up their past. They
retain their love of poetry and brightly coloured clothing, ornately carved
furniture, distinctive pink, yellow and green ceramics, elaborate ritual and
family ceremonies, cuisine that is Chinese in its refinement but Malayan in
its spiciness.
There were traces of all these things in Roland's house. As Malacca's
economy declined and Peranakan wealth shifted to Penang, Singapore or
Sydney, the uncles and brothers, cousins and great aunts who lived there
gradually moved away; today Roland is the sole resident of a vast,
extended-family building stretching 93 yards from front door to back.
Roland refuses to leave all this; he is too proud of his ancestral home and
his culture. But the Peranakans who remain on Heeren Street are not alone in
nurturing the past. They are just one of half-a-dozen cultures thrown up by
Malacca's history.
Amid clouds of joss smoke in the Cheng Hoon Teng temple, the oldest in
Malaysia, Roland introduced me to friends in the ethnic Chinese community.
At the Kampong Hulu Mosque I met Malay Muslims. At the Murthi Hindu temple I
watched Malacca's Indians at prayer.
In the town's crowded commercial district I talked to Chetti money-lenders,
the off-spring of Malay-Indian marriages, plying their trade sitting
cross-legged in front of safes. On the beach outside town I watched
Portuguese-speaking fishermen set sail.
The domes and spires of Coleridge's Xanadu grow dimmer daily. Kipling's
flying fish are rare of late in Mandalay. But I am reassured. In the great
rainbow mix of races in one quiet backwater of the east, the past lives.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Travel: The other face of the mystic orient - South-east
Asia / Victor Mallet rides the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEONE has to say it. South-east Asia in the 1990s is about as exotic and
mysterious as Margate in winter, writes Victor Mallet. This became clear to
me as I approached the inner sanctum of the ancient temple of Angkor Wat in
Cambodia. I was ready to be awe-struck. I was not ready for the electronic
burbling noises: a Khmer woman seated on a wall was concentrating
ferociously as she played her hand-held 'Game Boy.'
Over in Borneo, my climb to the top of Mt Kinabalu, the highest mountain in
south-east Asia, was marred by the unwanted company of two coachloads of
Koreans. It is hardly surprising that the Kinabalu friendly warbler which
hopped about happily at the feet of the first climbers in the middle of the
last century is now not very friendly and rarely seen. My certificate
suggests that I am at least the 72,406th person to have reached the peak.
In south-east Asia, people spend much of their time buying things in
shopping malls, sitting in traffic jams and watching soap operas on
television. Forests are cut down to make way for condominiums. Hills are
demolished and taken away to be used as cement for motorways and
skyscrapers.
So you can ignore all the obligatory guff about (I quote) 'the exotic and
mysterious east' in the brochures published by the new Eastern &amp; Oriental
Express train company. Thailand may be 'a land of water lilies, bright green
rice fields and swaying palm trees,' but it is also a country of polluted
rivers, urban sprawl and probably the ugliest capital city in the world.
As for the southern town of Hat Yai - 'a commercial centre known for its
naughty night-life' - it is a concrete jungle full of seedy brothels for
visiting Malaysians.
Not that south-east Asia is dull; nor is it uniform. In the course of a
42-hour, 1,943-kilometre journey up the Malayan peninsula, the E &amp; O can
transport you in great luxury from order to chaos - from Singapore, in other
words, to Bangkok by way of Kuala Lumpur. Each of the three countries on the
route is undergoing an economic boom. But each has chosen to handle its good
fortune in a different way.
Singapore believes in discipline and control. Everything works. The airport
functions so smoothly, and passengers are whisked away so promptly, that you
wonder where everybody is when you first fly in.
Chewing gum is banned because it is messy and it used to interfere with the
closing of the doors on the subway trains. Citizens are urged in government
advertising campaigns to be polite, flush the toilets and have more babies.
They generally obey. Managers of high-rise hotels forbid you to open the
window of your room. Information is restricted.
Thailand is the opposite. It is undisciplined and chaotic. Traffic jams are
so nightmarish that the government advised people last year to carry
provisions and portable toilets in their cars.
There are hundreds of laws, but few people obey them. Prostitution is
illegal and even the mildest love scenes are censored at the movies. But you
can walk out of the cinema into a brothel owned by the police, or
participate (if you wish) in a live sex show.
Armed with this information, you can settle down in the bar of the E &amp; O
express with a beer - or a Dollars 180 bottle of Dom Perignon - and engage
in the debate that often dominates expatriate conversations in south-east
Asia: which is better, Bangkok or Singapore?
The arguments can be passionate. Residents of Singapore are torn between
praising the island's convenience and cleanliness on the one hand, and
claiming, on the other, that it is much more interesting than it seems. In
support of the latter line of thought, a commodity broker once told me how
his boss, visiting from London, died in his hotel room after being drugged
and robbed by a transvestite prostitute.
Bangkok loyalists are equally ambivalent. They abhor the pollution and
corruption of Thailand, but regard Singapore as impossibly humourless and
sterile, a sort of shiny Swiss hospital parked in the tropics. (Kuala
Lumpur, psychologically as well as geographically, comes somewhere in
between).
What all of south-east Asia has in common is the urge to make money. The
leisurely, nostalgic journey on the E &amp; O, with its wood-panelled interior
inspired by the 1932 film Shanghai Express, is aimed more at the visitor
than at local tycoons.
Among those who most enjoyed the trip I took were a wealthy tourist couple
from New Zealand and a pair of Surbiton teachers on honeymoon. Meanwhile,
the managing director of a Thai company had a habit of rushing to the
observation car at the back of the train with his short-wave radio to find
out the yen/dollar rate. Fun for some, perhaps, but hardly exotic.
Victor Mallet was a guest of Eastern &amp; Oriental Express, a sister of the
Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. Address: Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London SE1 9PF, tel: (071)-928-6000, fax: (071)-620-1210. The train
travels each way between Singapore and Bangkok once a week. Passengers can
board or alight at other main stations on the way. Excursions are also
planned to places such as Malacca in Malaysia and Kanchanaburi, the site of
the Death Railway's bridge over the river Kwai in Thailand.
Fares start at Pounds 740 per person for a sleeping compartment and meals
one way between Singapore and Bangkok. Single occupancy supplement: Pounds
370 for sleeping compartments. State compartments cost Pounds 1,020 per
person (single supp Pounds 510).

FT  11 SEP 93 / Battle for a king's crown: Leonard Barden reports on
Kasparov and Short's latest game play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE body language says it all. Kasparov is perpetually restless, shifting to
and fro in his chair, striding off to his rest-room, or consulting his
score-sheet. Short sits stiffly, throbbing vein in his forehead, looking
tense and stern. On Thursday night, when Kasparov had recovered from a
dubious middle game to an endgame initiative, Short even started muttering
to himself as if cursing his ill-luck.
So far, the British champion has lost the first game on time in a
near-winning position after Kasparov completely spoilt a decisive attack,
while the second game was drawn after Short dominated the early stages.
The problem is that Short is jinxed against the Russian. Since he scored his
solitary tournament win over Kasparov in 1986, Nigel has met him 15 times
with the dreadful outcome of four draws and 11 defeats. His frustration at
such a sequence will be greater since their two games at the Savoy Theatre
have featured the best positions he has had against Kasparov during the
seven years.
The main hope for Short on the evidence of the first two games is that so
far Kasparov has played below his awesome best. He missed simple wins by his
own high standards in game one, while in game two he was outplayed for the
first 20 moves, with his king stranded in the centre of the board unable to
castle. Still, the overall impression is that Kasparov is just slightly
misfiring, like a sports car revving-up to full power.
Short said before the match that he was under no pressure and could simply
enjoy the game. The pressures, however, are inescapable. First, he needs a
win, and soon, to convince himself that he can score against Kasparov. If he
performs well, the tension of approaching the greatest upset in world
championship history will mount; if he does badly, there is the constant
problem of containing Kasparov's lead. Only in the final few games, if he
has no chance of the title but is losing by an honourable two or three
points, can he truly relax.
Kasparov's situation is already more comfortable. He has added, albeit
unconvincingly, a point to the cushion he enjoys as title-holder of
retaining his crown in the event of a tied series.
The champion is an overwhelming 5-1 on favourite with bookmakers, although
spread betting firms, which effectively offer odds about the margin of
victory, report that most of their clients are backing Short to lose by a
narrower margin than the six or seven points over 24 games that was
predicted before play began.
Offboard, Channel 4, with three transmissions each playing day, has
recovered from a shaky start against BBC 2's half-hour programme. The BBC
has a lively commentary team, film of the rival Fide world championship in
the Netherlands, and featured a splendid confrontation between Florencio
Campomanes, the Fide president, and Dominic Lawson in his role of Short's
Boswell. Channel 4 has exclusive access to Kasparov and Short and its longer
air-time provides interesting running commentaries during play, aimed at
beginners and committed chess fans.
The first two games have been well attended but the crunch for The Times's
optimistic seat-pricing (Pounds 20-Pounds 55, reduced from the original
Pounds 45-Pounds 150) will come when the novelty wears off and especially if
Short is trailing. I shall not be surprised if spectators can watch the
later games for a more realistic Pounds 7 or Pounds 10, so if you are
thinking about a visit to the Savoy and are deterred by the cost then wait
till the second half of the match in October.
The rival Fide world championship between Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman is
also under way in the Netherlands. Fide is the established world-ruling
chess body supported by 130 national federations, while the PCA of Kasparov
and Short is a new breakaway group.
Nevertheless, Karpov v Timman is widely seen as a reserve match. Both
players were soundly defeated by Short in the Fide eliminators, while the
Pounds 900,000 finance for the Fide match comes solely from the Sheikh of
Oman, where the second half will be played, after the Netherlands was unable
to raise its half of the prize money.
Kasparov rubbished the rival series at his pre-match Press conference,
saying: 'I think more people will come to see us than the citizens who watch
Karpov and Timman.' However, the games at Zwolle have been played to packed
audiences of nearly 1,000 daily and enthusiasm is growing after a promising
start by Timman, who was regarded as a no-hoper in view of his poor record
against Karpov. The score is 1-1, with one draw.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Truth of the Matter: Is science all a bore? - Or do
scientists make it seem boring?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AUGUST 1838 the Rev Professor Adam Sedgwick went to Tynemouth to give a
lecture on behalf of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
His lecture theatre was Tynemouth beach, his subject the surrounding and
underlying rocks and his audience was mostly made up of local colliers -
3,000-4,000 of them.
This was a remarkable event in its time, but seems even more remarkable now.
One hesitates to impugn the minds of modern miners, but it is hard to
imagine them turning out by the thousand for a geology field class. It is
equally difficult to imagine a Cambridge professor today managing to hold
such a vast lay audience - especially with slides, overhead projector and
photocopied handouts.
It will never be like that again. That is the lament which all scientists
can justifiably rehearse. Sedgwick was (literally) at the cutting edge of
modern geology. The sequences of the earth's surfaces now established in
textbooks - the order of Cambrian and Silurian, for example - were then
matters for passionate, friendship- wrecking debate. Fresh crops of fossils
nourished their own thriving and inventive taxonomy. And up into the Welsh
mountains with Sedgwick scrambled the young Charles Darwin, soon to become
more of a household name than Mrs Beeton.
All this predates the 'two cultures' mentality either described or
fabricated by C P Snow some 30 years ago. Would any modern publisher be able
to produce what was hugely successful in the last century - a guide to the
Lake District, combining the geological analyses of Sedgwick with the
poetical topography of William Wordsworth?
Sedgwick duly did his stint as president of the British Association. David
Weatherall, current president, made the blanket complaint during the
association's latest gathering at Keele, that British society was
'anti-science'.
This is a complaint heard regularly from university dons, and is often
extended to describe Britain as an unfriendly habitat for any sort of
intellectual, let alone the pure scientist.
But Weatherall at least had the honesty to heap part of the blame on himself
and his colleagues. Locked in their own impenetrable Argo, their
peer-reviewed journals and their bubbling laboratories, scientists have
become plain negligent at explaining themselves. In Weatherall's own field
of medicine, there ought to be public excitement about new research. Perhaps
not the pitch of excitement enjoyed by Sedgwick et al, but at least a
significant awareness. Many common afflictions - arthritis for one - remain,
after all, fundamentally mysterious. So why should we be excluded from the
fun of discovery?
Britain is not intrinsically an anti-science nation. Measuring public
commitment is tricky, though it may be relatively consoling to David
Weatherall that 50 per cent of Americans are said not to believe in the
theory of evolution. But the people who put Stephen Hawking's Brief History
of Time into the best seller lists, whose children noisely throng the South
Kensington museums, who ensure David Attenborough's faunal epics prime time
on television, cannot be accused of lacking the basic willingness to be
informed. The fault lies with those who refuse to inform.
This issue is made topical by the failure of universities to fill places on
science-based courses. It has also become personally contingent, as I
undertake this autumn the editorship of The Cambridge Review, a journal
which ought to provide a means of divulging all sorts of university
research. But the biggest challenge of the job, according to the outgoing
editors, is that scientists will not write. And so the principal energies of
the university remain largely obscure to the public at large.
One of the contributors to the recent Keele congress was a specialist in
artificial intelligence. He has been trying to get computers to write
novels, and has concluded that the next Flaubert will never be an Apple Mac.
Disappointing news, then, to those scientists who prefer to remain mute.
But the solution does lie in Flaubert's direction. It was demonstrated in
1967, when James Watson published a great account of his investigations into
molecular structure with Francis Crick. The story of DNA would not be a
story at all if it were not for Watson's use of the storyteller's craft. No
one says that he misrepresents the actual research. But in The Double Helix
he certainly exaggerates the personalities of himself, his collaborator, and
their rivals. In short, he amalgamates the processes of scientific inquiry
with the techniques of literary narrative.
The DNA tale is presently being televised. It is to be hoped that it scores
on our screens; and that more scientists will follow Watson's elementary
lead.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Morality of greed and nepotism: Professor John Broome says
the new capitalism praised by Lord Lawson last week is a licence for dog to
eat dog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Professor JOHN BROOME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD LAWSON'S moral defence of capitalism is chiefly a negative one. It is a
response to two moral objections that have been raised against capitalism;
that it rests on self-interest, and that it promotes inequality between
people, both of which are claimed to be morally bad.
Lawson's positive case for capitalism is less moral than economic: he claims
it is very successful economically. If he can refute the moral objections,
he feels its success is enough to recommend it.
Has capitalism been economically successful? - I mean Lawson's own radical
capitalism, not the moderate type that previously prevailed in the UK.
Compare the success of the two.
In the 12 years after Margaret Thatcher's election in 1979, with the
tremendous advantage of North Sea oil, UK national income grew at an average
rate of 1.8 per cent per year. In the previous 12 years, mostly under Labour
and with the Opec oil crisis to contend with, it grew at 2.4 per cent. The
unemployment rate was on average almost three times higher after 1979. To be
sure, inflation was largely under control, but control of inflation is
supposed to be a means to growth rather than an end in itself, and the
growth did not follow.
Of course, the two periods were very different, and there is no knowing what
would have happened under different management. But the record certainly
does not support Lawson's claim of economic success.
It looks more like failure. Capitalism has scored political success, of
course.
Growth after 1979 was very unevenly distributed across the population.
Nearly half the increased income went to the richest 15 per cent, so for
them capitalism has indeed been economically successful. But not for the
rest. The poorest five per cent actually got poorer. Lawson commends
capitalism as the way to reduce poverty, but in fact his capitalism
increased it. You can see the new homeless poor in the streets.
Now the moral arguments. Lawson does not deny that capitalism relies on self
interest and that it promotes inequality. He does deny these are bad things.
On the first, he points out that people are naturally self-interested, and
an economic system does well to make use of the propensity. I agree that
much of our behaviour is self interested, and furthermore to a large extent
our ordinary morality makes no objection.
Morality allows us to pursue our own interests, but it sets boundaries. One
moral boundary it that you must obey the law.
You must not snatch an old lady's handbag, even if it is perfectly safe to
do so, and you must not divert pension funds for your private gain. Morality
also tells you not to do somethings that the law permits. You may work for
your own prosperity, but not deliberately at the expense of other people.
You must not hurt the people around you, and you should act fairly towards
them. Dog eats dog is not how society ought to be.
But the new capitalism licensed dog to eat dog. It pushed back the
boundaries of what is morally permitted in the pursuit of self interest. It
encouraged people to believe they could do anything so long as it was legal.
Not surprisingly, as the boundaries moved back, more people trespassed even
beyond the law.
Crime increased on the streets and in high circles. Business schools started
to teach 'business ethics', presumably because their students had forgotten
the elementary morality their mothers taught them. A growing nastiness
spread through British society in the 1980s. The new capitalism did, indeed,
contribute to moral decline.
Inequality next. Lawson denies the value of equality, but he himself
presents the best argument for it. He insists on the claims of equity and
desert: if one person works overtime and another does not, he says, the
former deserves more pay.
Certainly. What egalitarians complain about is not inequality itself, but
undeserved inequality. They believe pay should be in proportion to desert.
When a labourer finds a director earning ten times as much as him, he knows
the director does not work ten times as hard. So how does he or she deserve
the pay? By talents and ability, perhaps? Capitalism rewards some talents,
but not others. It rewards good accountants, persuasive salesmen, people who
are quick to take a money-making opportunity, artists who produce popular
ephemera.
It does not reward modest, skilful and hardworking craftsmen, doctors who
practice where they are most needed rather than where they are paid the
most, poets and pure scientists who permanently enrich our culture. Why
should the possessors of the capitalist talents be the ones who deserve
reward, and not these others? Just because capitalism rewards a talent, it
does not follow that this talent deserves reward more than others.
In any case, the main cause of the difference between the labourer and the
director is probably their different starting points in life. Most
inequality in the UK is not determined either by work or talent, but by
prior advantage. It is possible to achieve prosperity from disadvantaged
beginnings but much easier if you have been to the right school.
When Lawson commends the family, he means to commend, not just love and
security at home, but the transmission of wealth and privilege from one
generation to the next. This is another way capitalism distributes
advantages and disadvantages to those who do not deserve them. Moreover,
capitalism reguarly throws people into undeserved poverty by taking away
their jobs. A great deal of the inequality under capitalism has nothing to
do with merit or desert. That is, indeed, immoral.
So the moral arguments against the new capitalism still stand, and
economically it seems more a failure than a success.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Fishing: In the steps of the master
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I DOUBT if there has been a cleverer, more clear-sighted trout fisherman
than the dry-stick legal eagle, G E M Skues. The initials stood for George
Edward Mackenzie, but he wasn't the sort of chap you hailed with: 'George,
old man, how's it going?' Emotionally he kept himself to himself, lived with
his sisters in Croydon, south London, worked for the same firm of solicitors
for 60 years, and devoted whatever passion he had to a Hampshire chalk
stream and its residents.
Skues first fished the Itchen as a boy at Winchester, and I find it a
consoling thought that he caught nothing at all for four months. Its
pellucid water, emerald weed and highly scholastic trout gripped his
intellect and imagination and never slackened. His great gift was to see
through the surface, into the water. He observed, analysed, calculated,
produced solutions. He was not, I think, a writer of the first rank, for his
sympathies were narrow and he did not concern himself with the humanity and
philosophy of the sport. But he was a stylist, in his dry, precise way, with
a lawyer's sense of humour. And he was a brilliantly original thinker about
fishing.
As such, Skues made enemies among the English, who treasure mediocrity and
conventionality. Without going too far into the abstrusities of fly fishing
theory, it is enough to say that he stood the sport on its head. His great
discovery was that chalkstream trout gained more of their diet from eating
insects below the surface, than from snaffling those on it. It hardly sounds
earth shattering, but the chalkstream code was built on the dogma that the
only way to catch a trout was with an imitation of the floating fly.
This code was long on hypocrisy, myopia and snobbery; distinctly short on
commonsense. But its devotees, the English sport-loving gentry, clung to it
with all the fierce, obstinate prejudice of their breed. And Skues, a
thousand times brainier than they, and just as obstinate, danced rings round
them in argument. I had long cherished the hope of fishing the stretch of
the Itchen on which Skues developed his theories and practice, and from
which he was eventually driven by ill feeling. It is called Abbots Barton,
and lies on the outskirts of Winchester, where the roar of the bypass
traffic competes with the chimes of cathedral bells where Isaak Walton's
bones lie.
No one could pretend that it is a place of untouched, sylvan loveliness. But
between the road, and the housing estate, and the factories and warehouses
looming through the trees, are spread the water meadows much as they were in
Skues' day, dotted with copses and spinneys and intersected by the Itchen
and its carriers.
The fishing is still good, though not as good as in that golden era. The
hatches of fly are comparatively plentiful, the water is pure, the fish are
wary, and the condition of the place first rate. Much of the credit for this
goes to a man as unlike the old-style Itchen stuffed shirt as it is possible
to imagine.
Roy Darlington is unmistakeably a Midlander, square-jawed, blunt speaking.
When he came to Abbots Barton, it was derelict. Moved by the spirit of
Skues, and with much help from his brother, Ron, and a band of companions,
he set about clearing the little streams, shifting the silt, allowing the
crystal water to move once more. He directed me to the main river that same
evening. As I strolled across the meadow, I was thinking about the old ways,
when a system of irrigating ditches led the flood water of winter to soak
the land. I was wondering what had happened to these ditches when suddenly I
fell into one. Squelching on to the river, I passed by the seat dedicated to
Skues. Not a trout rose in earnest, until directed by a kind fellow angler I
came upon cluster of them, feeding on a sparse hatch of bluewinged olives.
Oh Skues of blessed memory, I thought, as I knotted an an Orange Quill. He
it was who discovered that this fly, with its hot orange body, could pass
itself off as the BWO in the late evening. The first fish I covered took it
like a lamb, and fought like a tiger. When darkness fell, I made my way back
through the meadow, with my two-and-a-quarter pounder in my bag and raised
my hat reverentially to the shadow of a great fisherman.

FT  11 SEP 93 / As they say in Europe: Insults lose sting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEPTEMBER is usually a good month for connoisseurs of conflict. September is
when wars start, currencies crash and politics resume. But all those who
expected a revival of cross-border rows as a natural accompaniment to mists,
mellow fruitfulness, and the first worries about what is wrong with the
central heating, will be disappointed by this September, a month that
promised so much.
September 2 saw the erection of a replica of an old statue of Kaiser Wilhelm
I on the banks of the Rhine, glaring down on the battlefield of Sedan where
the French took such a beating at the hands of his troops a century and a
quarter ago. (The original was destroyed by the Americans in 1945 in the
final assault on the Third Reich).
The insult was doubled by the choice of the day - the anniversary of Sedan,
which falls neatly between the anniversary of the invasion of Poland in 1939
and the Anglo-French declaration of war two days later. The British papers
chortled gleefully at this appalling provocation.
Nothing happened in France, though. There were no screaming editorials, just
the occasional paragraph noting German protestations that the choice of the
date was 'an accident of the calendar.' If you want to upset the French
these days, you have to strike at the heart of the country - like suggesting
that the money thrown away on farm subsidies should be reduced, or that
their football teams should not be allowed to bribe their way to the
European Cup.
A couple of days after the affair of the Kaiser's statue, the body of
Hungary's Admiral Horthy was transported from Portugal and re-buried at his
home. Horthy was the man who used his friendship with the Nazis to ensure
his country regained bits of other countries in which large numbers of
Hungarians happened to live. In this endeavour, he had the support of his
countrymen but not of his neighbours.
Again, the expected explosion did not materialise. Only the Romanians got
excited about the affair, but it was routine stuff by their standards. The
Bucharest daily, Adevarul, put the news of the re-burial on the front page
and accused Hungarian leaders of representing Horthy as a 'dedicated hero.'
Others warned of the damage to 'Hungarian domestic policy and Budapests's
international relations.'
In Slovakia, an early Horthy target and a country where the situation of the
Hungarian minority continues to spur domestic strife, the re-burial ranked
only eighth on the news bulletins. This apparent apathy might, I surmised,
have resulted from the fact that the Slovaks themselves were busy putting up
plaques to those who collaborated with their Nazi protectors during their
country's last, somewhat inglorious, period of independence.
The British may well sneer at the way other nations commemorate national
heroes whose sole claim to merit is that they were (as in the case of the
Kaiser) not horrible or stupid like their successors or (like Horthy)
someone who bore a passing resemblance to a human being in a period and
region dominated by psychopaths. But 1993 is the year of the offensive
memorial, and the British themselves led the way when the Queen Mother
unveiled a statue of the late Lord 'Bomber' Harris in May.
He was the man who master-minded the attempt to lay waste to Germany during
the second world war. The memorial was probably not the result of any desire
to annoy but rather a guilty feeling that Harris had been overlooked
unfairly in the past. The Germans were upset because the statue appeared in
1993 and not 1946, which would have been understandable.
In other words, this year is the one where the peoples of Europe feel they
can again ride rough-shod over whatever sensitivities their neighbours may
possess. But the odd thing is that, not only in France but also in eastern
Europe, there seems a certain preparedness to react with moderation.
Government-to-government relations remain reasonably civilised in spite of
the pursuit of campaigns, in one country or another, to revive ancient
grudges. Scarcely a day passes when the Hungarian press does not mention the
tribulations of their brothers in Transylvania or Slovakia; yet, somehow,
the governments rub along together.
A year ago, there were forecasts that the Yugoslav nightmare would spread
throughout the Balkans; that has not happened. The Greeks threatened
heavens-knows-what over the Macedonian question but the swords have remained
sheathed. The Bulgarians, unexpectedly, have not taken advantage of their
new freedom to attack anybody and Albania has not been provoked by Serb
oppression of its sons in Kosovo.
Dare one think: is Europe growing up? Is it possible for one nation to
indulge in absurd or offensive gestures wthout enraging others? And, if that
is the case, will the indulgence now cease?

FT  11 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Bandsman on the run - Nick
Garnett finds a company that aims to scale the heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID Haines opts for a subdued pitch when he blows his own trumpet. He
could be forgiven for warbling a lot louder.
An energetic Welshman with a penchant for permed hair, he studied at the
Royal College of Music and, capable on a wide range of brass and wind
instruments, was bandmaster at Repton public school for nine years. Then, in
1967, an initial investment of Pounds 750 bought him a share of a music shop
in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire.
The business, Normans, has six shops these days and has given him a
converted farmhouse in 10 acres, a helicopter, and a new Jaguar whenever he
wants one. Now owned outright by him, it is one of Britain's largest
retailers of musical instruments with a yearly turnover of Pounds 5m.
Haines' entrepreneurial instinct was shown more recently when he and his
wife, Pam, transformed a potentially serious threat to the company's future
into what is now virtually a new enterprise. In only four years, this latest
venture has grown to generate annual turnover of Pounds 1.75m and will
provide all the company's future growth.
Haines explains: 'My main worry in the late 1980s was changes in government
funding, which meant that schools were having to take control of their own
budgets.
'If local authority music instruction teams - what we call peripatetic
teachers - were disbanded, that would hurt demand for our products. Those
teachers effectively controlled 90 per cent of the educational instrument
market.'
The point, says Haines, is that most of the company's sales are to
school-children and the parents who encourage them to start blowing wind
instruments or twanging guitar strings. If school music teaching were
curtailed because of shrinking budgets, instrument sales could plunge.
Haines tackled this with some novel ideas which provide a few lessons in the
art of franchising.
First, the company started a leasing arrangement by which parents could
hire, and then buy, instruments through monthly Pounds 13 subscriptions over
a three-year contract.
Second, Normans started winning contracts to supply part-time music teachers
to schools, eventually farming out these teachers into a full-time franchise
operation.
Under the leasing scheme, there are 30 in-school lessons in the first year;
in the second and third year, instruction costs Pounds 28.50 a term. The
hirer gets to own the instrument after the third year.
This compares with a typical purchase cost of around Pounds 200 for a
trumpet or clarinet from one of Normans' shops - around double what the
company pays to buy it from its main US supplier.
Some 190 schools (all primary and junior) and 3,100 children now have
instrument instruction from teachers employed under the franchise system.
This makes money for the company and boosts instrument sales. 'The aim is to
have 10,000 kids learning instruments with us by 1995, so the Pounds 1.75m
turnover will be up at Pounds 4m,' says Haines.
To attract parents to its leasing scheme, the company first canvasses head
teachers. But the scheme itself is sold by the company's six salesmen, who
visit schools and talk to parents in the evenings. Haines says: 'Out of
3,000 people joining up, only four have defaulted on payments.'
The scheme hinges on teaching, though, and it is here that Haines has scored
most effectively. At first, he employed half a dozen teachers directly, but
there were 40 by the start of this year. 'This could not be controlled by
us,' says Haines, 'so we decided to use a franchise system where the
franchisee organises the teaching in schools under our overall supervision.'
The company now has six franchisees and expects to have 20 by the end of
next year. Each plays an instrument and acts as a co-ordinator. The target
is for each eventually to control another six teachers, with 900 children
under tuition.
Each pays Normans Pounds 12,000 and, for this, the company provides
catalogues, eight instruments for demonstration, help on teacher
time-tabling, and cash-flow forecasts. The bait is a target net income for
the franchisee of Pounds 25,000 a year after three years.
A few headaches have interrupted the new venture. Some county councils seem
keen to block Normans' business in senior schools (one court action brought
by Haines is now pending) while leasing and teaching arrangements are still
confined largely to the Midlands and north.
But Haines is confident. 'There are 37,500 primary schools in the UK and at
least 500,000 children under 11 playing musical instruments,' he says. 'So,
there is a lot of potential out there for us.'
While the company's goal is to make money, Haines easily persuades visitors
that he has an altruistic interest in seeing more children play instruments.
His showroom in Burton-on-Trent houses a music school and he still teaches
occasionally at his home.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: How to make your updates
automatic - Second of two articles by Jean Miles on monitoring share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been looking at ways to update share prices automatically in a
computer portfolio program. Accessing prices via a telephone line through a
modem is an excellent but relatively expensive way of doing it. The other
possibilities, by no means to be despised, are to convert your computer into
a teletext receiver or to subscribe to a data disk service.
With all systems, each share must be identified by a code name which
corresponds precisely - including the distribution of capital and small
letters in the name - to the code name used in the data source. If your
portfolio program can accept automatic updates, there will be space for the
code to be entered along with other data when you first identify the share
to the program.
Installing a teletext card has the advantage over all other systems that,
once acquired, it involves no further expense. Among the disadvantages are
that you will need to plug a television aerial into your computer; and that
the teletext pages on both the BBC and ITV list only about 500 shares
between them whereas more than 3,000 equities, gilts, USM stocks and
London-listed overseas securities actually are quoted on the stock exchange.
Curious and very apprehensive, I installed a teletext card from Microtext.
But everything went smoothly including Fast-Link, the program which
transferred the teletext data into my own files in the portfolio management
program called Fairshares Watchdog.
The Microtext manual explains how to instal and tune the card, how to 'grab'
teletext pages, and includes directions for finding and saving the prices of
particular shares. So, if you are proficient in such matters, you could
import your teletext data into a spreadsheet, or use it to update share
prices in any investment program as long as you know (or can figure out) the
necessary data format.
For instance, the budget program called Quicken includes a shares investment
module; and the Quicken manual, for both the MS-DOS and the Windows versions
of the program, explains clearly the data format the program can 'read' and
the procedure for importing prices.
Market Breaker, from Alibro Software, is a 'share price analyser' program
running under the Windows operating system and designed specifically to take
data from teletext without the need for any other program to make the
connection. It will draw a number of interesting graphs. You can add
non-teletext shares and update them by hand.
Sharewatch, from Dividend Associates, is a program which comes supplied with
prices, results and dividends for approximately 1,400 companies going back
several years. It is simplicity itself to use. The data can be sorted,
analysed and graphed in a number of ways. Shares can be assigned to a
portfolio. Prices can be updated weekly, fortnightly or monthly with a new
disk which simply over-writes the previous data files, leaving the portfolio
information intact.
Although it lacks some of the features of a complete portfolio management
program, Sharewatch - at Pounds 40 for the program and Pounds 4.10 or less
for the update disks, including VAT - is remarkable value for money. It begs
the question we started out with - that of how to update prices
automatically in your own portfolio program - but it is so cheap that you
might want to have a look at it, anyway.
I also tried the weekly data disk service offered by Fairshares Software for
use with its programs. This is utterly simple to use and, like Sharewatch,
is therefore a good choice for those uneasy about their computer expertise.
Over some months, the disk has never failed to arrive in Tuesday's post.
All I have to do is put it in the disk drive and choose 'data service
update' from the opening menu. Occasionally, one or two prices fail to
register, and some of the more recondite unit trusts are not included, but
these are not serious complaints. The cost starts at Pounds 60 a quarter,
including VAT, for 'all equities' weekly closing prices' and goes up as you
choose other data options.
For users of other programs, the Financial Times' Finstat service offers
monthly data disks from Pounds 40, weekly from Pounds 65 (both plus VAT) -
expensive, but not absolutely out of the question. You would have to confer
with Finstat and/or with the supplier of your software about importing the
data into your own files.
I set out on this quest convinced that typing prices was a useful exercise,
keeping me in close touch with the progress of each share. But I have
enjoyed being awash with data. If I were a more active or adventurous
investor, I would certainly go automatic. If active, adventurous and poor, I
would choose Sharewatch.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Children's shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have three children, aged 16, 12 and 10. Last year I gave them some money
which they asked me to invest on their behalf in one company's shares. The
shares are registered in my name with a designation showing that I am
holding them for my three children equally.
The shares produce less than Pounds 300 per year in income. The dividends
are made payable to me, with the children's designation shown on the cheque.
I pay this into my bank account and transfer to each of my children one
third of the net amount.
1) Am I right in supposing that each child can claim the tax credit for
his/her third of the total gross annual income?
2) If so, would this hold true if the company declared an increase in its
dividend to the point where the gross amount was above Pounds 300 per year,
or would all the income then be treated as mine?
3) If my children were to ask me to sell the shares and a profit was made
would they, or I, be liable for CGT?
4) If, after selling the shares for a profit, my children were to ask me to
reinvest the proceeds in a higher yielding share which produced an income
exceeding Pounds 300, would the entire income be deemed to have come from
me, or only that proportion of it which correspond to my original gift?
First, we should point out that you and your wife cannot escape your legal
duties and responsibilities for proper investment of your children's money
be merely doing what they each ask you to do. You may wish to consult a
solicitor on your legal obligations.
1) Yes, in principle (subject to evidence of the terms of the gift last
year), provided that by 'Less than Pounds 300' you mean 'Less than Pounds
300 inclusive of tax credit'.
2) All the income would then be treated as yours, under section 663 of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
3) The chargeable gains would be assessable upon each child, in principle.
4) All the income would be treated as yours, as under question 2.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I RECEIVE two pensions, one from the state and the other from a company. The
former is paid into my bank account every 28 days and my company pension
every calendar month. Thus, there are 12 payments a year from my company
pension and 13 from the state.
When the 13th payment of the state pension was made this year, it was
credited to my account on April 8 1993 which, in my opinion, is the tax year
1993/94. The tax office concerned will not agree and is taxing me as if I
received it weekly and in the tax year 1992/93. But the 13th monthly payment
was not available to me until after the start of the new tax year on April 6
1993.
The inspector is right. Section 41(2) of the Finance Act 1989 says: 'As
regards any particular year of assessment, income tax shall be charged on
the amount of the pension or other benefit accruing in respect of the year;
and this shall apply irrespective of when any amount is actually paid in
respect of the pension or other benefit.'
This rule applies to (a) a pension, stipend or annuity chargeable under
paragraph 2, 3 or 4 of Schedule E; (b) a pension or annual payment
chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 133 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (voluntary pensions); (c) income support
chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 151 of that act; (d) a
pension chargeable under Schedule E by virtue of section 597 of that act
(retirement benefit schemes); and (e), a benefit chargeable under Schedule E
by virtue of section 617(1) of that act (social security benefits).
Income tax is levied according to arbitrary rules laid down by parliament
and it is rarely possible to deduce one's tax liability by the application
of logic or by extrapolation.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Back from abroad . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM A British civil servant who returned recently from a two-year
secondment overseas where I paid no UK tax or national insurance. Should I
now consider paying voluntary NI contributions for the period of my absence,
and what is this likely to cost?
I had been paying class 1 national insurance contributions for about eight
years before my work overseas, and shall soon resume paying class 1
contributions for the foreseeable future. I am 32 years old.
As you are now back working in the UK and covered by the state social
security system, your prime concern is to ascertain how a two-year gap in
the national insurance contribution record could potentially reduce your
ultimate state flat-rate pension.
If you have paid contributions from the first time you were employed in the
UK, and have not had any other gaps overseas, it is possible that a two-year
gap in your contribution record either will have no effect or one that is so
minimal that you can ignore it.
Write (quoting your national insurance number) to the Department of Social
Security, Overseas Branch, Longbenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England NE98
1YX. It will be able to confirm the number of years credited to your
contribution record and the number of prospective years left.
If you ask, it will provide you with a table showing the number of years'
credit that you will require to obtain full benefits and the scaling down
effect of any shortfall.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Investment that deserves the risk -
The Speculator / In the first of a new series on high risk investments,
David Harris of accountants Chantrey Vellacott, examines the use of share
warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARRANTS are an excellent medium for both investment and speculation, but
there seems to be a widespread lack of understanding of how they work.
They present the chance of earning capital gains (warrants pay no income),
making them an attractive proposition for speculative and longer-term
investment. As a general rule, the investment performance of warrants will
exaggerate individual share price changes. Therefore, if the market is in a
'bull' phase and moving upwards, holders of warrants will likely do better
than ordinary shareholders. In a 'bear' market, the reverse is true.
Technically, warrants are transferable quoted option certificates issued by
companies. They entitle the warrant holder to buy a specific number of
shares within that company, at a pre-determined price, at a time, or during
a specific time in the future. They are traded on the Stock Exchange in the
same way as the underlying shares.
There are some 200 warrants listed on the Stock Exchange, issued by a
variety of companies from many market sectors. However, the market is
dominated by the investment trust sector which accounts for around
two-thirds of the total amount of warrants in issue.
The conversion terms governing the date, price and number of shares for
subscription are set when the warrant is issued and companies are obliged to
adjust these terms for any subsequent rights or capitalisation issues. The
precise date for the conversion of warrants will vary considerably and it is
therefore essential that investors are aware of the precise conversion
details.
The life of a particular warrant is specified at the time of issue. In
general, they will have a lifespan of several years and may, in exceptional
cases, be undated. Most of the current crop last well into the late 1990s
and beyond.
Advantages
The first and most obvious attraction of a warrant is that an investor gains
rights over a large number of shares for a relatively small outlay. For
instance, if XYZ Plc shares are priced at Pounds 1 then for an outlay of
Pounds 1,000, the investor would hold 1,000 shares. However, if, instead,
that individual bought warrants in XYZ Plc (where each warrant conferred the
right to buy one share) at 20p, then his initial investment of Pounds 1,000
would give him control over 5,000 shares and, therefore, offer a greater
potential capital gain.
Warrants also offer gearing. In essence, this is the opportunity for a
larger percentage capital gain (or loss). Using the example of XYZ Plc, if
the share price rose by 10p from Pounds 1 to Pounds 1.10, then a gain of 10
per cent will be produced. During the same period, individuals could expect
the price of warrants to rise similarly from 20p to 30p - a rise of 50 per
cent.
The gearing factor can be calculated by dividing share price by warrant
price. Generally, the higher the gearing factor, the greater the opportunity
for large capital gains.
Disadvantages
The benefits of the gearing effect also work in reverse, thus exacerbating
any fall in the underlying share price.
Furthermore, if the underlying share price stays or falls below the exercise
price during the subscription period, then the warrant is effectively
worthless. Warrants do not have any redemption value if they are not
exercised.
Warrants do not rank for dividends and do not give the warrant holder voting
rights or the right to attend ordinary shareholder's meetings. They simply
provide the opportunity and right to buy shares on the agreed terms.
Before deciding whether to invest in this area, it is important to have some
idea of how to assess the attractiveness of warrants and have a knowledge of
how to deal in this specialised market.
Next week, I will set out ways of evaluating the attractiveness of any
particular warrant and point you in the direction of specialised advice on
what is basically an under-researched market sector.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Group's Japan debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Japanese smaller companies investment trust is the first offering from
the recently merged Henderson Touche Remnant fund management group, writes
Philip Coggan. It aims to take advantage of what managers expect to be a
Japanese economic recovery in 1994-95 and of a re-rating of Japanese small
company shares.
The manager of the new trust, William Garnett, already runs an offshore,
open-ended fund - Henderson Horizon Japanese smaller companies - which was
second in its sector over the five years to September 1 (source: Hardwick
Stafford Wright).
The trust is hoping to raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m. The offer
will consist of ordinary shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a
one-for-five basis. The minimum investment will be Pounds 2,000.
Applications for shares must be received by October 14 and dealings open on
October 22.
The existence of the warrants, which will trade separately, is a device
designed to deal with the discount problem. Shares in investment trusts
often trade at a discount to net assets. That makes it hard to launch an
investment trust since, allowing for costs, investors are being asked to buy
new issue shares at a premium. But the warrants will have a value which
should compensate investors for any discount which occurs.
The annual management fee will be 1 per cent, and 75 per cent of the
management and interest costs will be charged to the capital account.
Initial expenses will be capped at 4 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sales by nine LWT directors made headline news when they were announced.
The sale was of more than 1m shares and raised Pounds 5.3m following the
conversion of management shares into ordinary.
The directors still retain considerable stakes in the company and have
undertaken not to sell any further shares without exceptional cause during
the course of the coming year.
Berkeley Group's managing director, Anthony Pidgeley, sold 500,000 shares at
431.5p. The group is involved in private residential housebuilding and
commercial property.
The company has seen its share price outperform the index by some 72 per
cent over the past year.
Following the sale Pidgeley still holds almost 4.5m shares.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurers who need insurance - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I BELIEVE in insurance. My family has medical insurance, car insurance,
disability, injury and accident insurance, house and contents insurance,
retirement annuity insurance, a whole range of life assurance policies, and
insurance linked to various savings plans. We even have legal expenses
insurance so we can sue anyone who fails to meet their obligations to us -
including insurance companies. But recent events have made me wonder how
many of those with which I have done business will still be around in their
present form 10 years from now.
Last month, I commented on the problems at Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire assurance
society. I would not be surprised if a few more companies announce various
'difficulties'. Some appear to be managed incompetently and one wonders what
horrors await to be discovered. Will their property holdings suffer the same
fate as those of the Church of England commissioners? If there is a sudden
market downturn, how many will be able to bail out quickly enough to prevent
huge write-downs in the value of their portfolios? How many make losses on
foreign currency speculations?
Hopefully, my policies are with companies that are safe and secure. But even
solid, respectable names have given me cause for some disappointment with
the slashing in value of bonus rates on with-profits policies. In January,
for instance, Equitable Life estimated that the maturity date payment under
one of my policies would, with final bonus included, be Pounds 14,600. By
April, that had fallen to Pounds 13,577. Although still a good performance,
it was obviously not as good as I had hoped.
Many companies have expanded their activities into offering other types of
investment product, such as unit trusts. Again, their track record has been
mixed. My two daughters were given Pounds 750 and Pounds 500 worth of units
in Equitable Life's special situations trust in August 1986. In August this
year, with income re-invested, the units were valued at around Pounds 1,005
and Pounds 670 respectively.
While this performance is not as bad as many other unit trusts, it is still
disappointing, even taking into account that a trust investing in 'special
situations' is likely to be much more speculative than one investing in a
more general spread of investments. At least it demonstrates the need for
careful consideration in choosing investments rather than assuming that, if
a company turns in a good performance in one area, it will necessarily do so
in others.
The insurance market is becoming increasingly competitive. In July, the
Treasury ruled that insurance companies would have to tell prospective
policy-holders how much commission the sales agent was getting. This should
help those mutual assurance companies which do not pay commission to agents.
Most do, however. A 25-year mortgage endowment policy with a premium of
Pounds 50 a month could produce up-front commission of Pounds 500 to the
salesman. Payments this size (and more) could well make many people think
twice before choosing an insurance product as a way to save - especially
when prospective customers will also have to be told more explicitly about
the size of penalties which the company will impose for early surrender.
I expect some companies will change some of their commission structures to
attract publicity for certain products. But there is little point in
choosing a company which pays little or no commission if its operating costs
eat away similar sums and/or if its overall investment performance is poor.
Also to be considered is the general level of staff competence. If a
policy-holder has to wait weeks for a company to sort out its mistakes with
his policies or payments, then the cost of the time wasted could easily
amount to more than the difference in monetary performance between the
company concerned and one of its rivals.
The Maxwell affair brought increased attention to the role and duties of
pension fund trustees. More independently-minded people and employee
representatives are likely to be appointed as company pension fund trustees,
and they will be taking an increasingly close interest in the performance of
their fund managers. This could lead to a greater movement of funds between
insurance companies.
It used to be that whichever company was used to set up a pension scheme
remained as that fund's manager. But now, if a fund manager fails to
perform, the trustees are more likely to consider the possibilities of
moving the scheme's management to another company.
What effect would this have on some of the smaller companies? If managed
funds worth hundreds of millions of pounds were taken away suddenly, what
would this do to their cost structures? How many would be prepared to cut
staff and costs? And what effect would this have on the bonus rates of
mutually owned companies?
I expect to see an increase in the number of small mutuals merging with one
another or 'de-mutualising' and perhaps being taken over by other companies.
In 1989 London Life, with which I have several policies, merged with the
Australian Mutual Provident. Another mutual where I have a policy, Scottish
Mutual, was taken over by Abbey National in 1992. There has also been a
variety of mergers and takeovers in other companies and I expect there will
be many more.
Unfortunately, these shake-ups do not seem to have made much difference to
the attitudes of several mutuals. Boards still seem to be 'self-selected'
with policy-holders, who 'own' the companies, getting little opportunity to
influence major decisions.
Indeed, many of the mutuals do not even bother to send their policy-holder
owners copies of their annual reports and details of the annual general
meeting. Mutuals should be obliged legally to provide as much information to
their owners as public companies must do to their shareholders.
While I welcome wholeheartedly the proposals for greater disclosures of
commission rates and surrender values, the insurance industry could still do
with a bit more shaking up.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Risks worry over BES returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED-exit business expansion schemes are promising investors annual returns
after five years of about 14 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer, an
attractive figure given that base rates are 6 per cent.
Some 'too good to be true' rates are just that, but here the returns are
made possible by exploiting the tax relief of up to 40 per cent. Readers
have expressed concern, however, that there could be underlying risks not
mentioned in the statutory warning section carried in the prospectuses.
Neil Warriner, of law firm Herbert Smith, says the prospectuses are worded
carefully to avoid misrepresentation, since the BES company cannot give a
cast-iron guarantee. The schemes are based on a contract between the
institution (most likely to be a university) and the BES company and are
enforceable under contract law. Warriner says the main risk is that the
university might not have enough money to buy back the property after five
years.
'If this were to happen, the investor knows that the BES company has the
property and could sell it to satisfy the obligation of the university. So,
the risk here is a valuation one; the price would have to be high enough to
provide the promised rate of return and the BES company could face a
corporation tax liability.'
To avoid defaulting on their obligations, many university schemes are
cash-backed. Investors should check to see if this backing will cover
everything that it should, and note the financial strength of the
institution where the money will be placed.
When a prospectus is launched, most sponsors are unable to say how much they
will put aside, or with which institution. 'This is because they do not know
how much will be raised and the market might change between the launch of
the scheme and its close,' says Warriner.
Christopher Parkinson, a partner at law firm Gouldens, says investors should
look for a bank guarantee, the track record of the directors and sponsors,
and the directors' benefits. 'If you are worried about any scheme, it is a
good idea to spread risk by investing Pounds 40,000 across a number of
schemes,' he adds.
Investors in university schemes should remember they could lose tax relief
if an immediate family member becomes a tenant of the BES company. The
university should be told so the student can be housed elsewhere.
Meanwhile, sponsor Johnson Fry this week launched its ninth cash-backed BES
for the Loughborough University of Technology with a fixed-exit price after
five years of 119p (equating to an annual return of 13.69 per cent to a
higher-rate taxpayer if the investor takes the 1p discount offered until
September 24).
Johnson Fry has also launched a scheme linked to the FT-SE 100 index to buy
property from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education. The return after
five years is 60p plus 1.65p for every 1 per cent rise in the index. There
are lock-ins after a 37 per cent rise (equating to an exit price of 121p)
and after a 100 per cent rise.
Joint sponsors Smith &amp; Williamson and Matrix Securities have released
Cavendish Geared II to buy residential property in London. The sponsors can
borrow 60 per cent of property acquisition costs if most of the funds are
raised, providing additional gearing for investors. There is a 2p discount
for investments made before September 30.
The Footsie-linked schemes are lagging behind the arranged-exit BES in
popularity. BESt Investment says only Pounds 28m of the 1993/94 BES funding
has gone into these so far, compared to Pounds 293m in the arranged-exit
schemes.
Save &amp; Prosper, which launched its BESSA Oxbridge scheme two weeks ago and
has raised Pounds 23m of its Pounds 38.75m target, says 70-75 per cent of
applicants have chosen the fixed-exit option of 121p. It feels the exit
price (equating to an annual return of 13.9 per cent to a higher-rate
taxpayer) and the strength of the stock market may have swung investors in
favour of the arranged-exit companies.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: How does your pension rate? - Debbie
Harrison reports on a new guide that lets members of more than 100 larger
company schemes in Britain compare their benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INNOVATIVE guide to more than 100 of the larger UK company pension
schemes, covering half of all workers with occupational pensions, reveals
just how generous - or miserly - different employers are and explains how
you can assess your own scheme's competitiveness.
The report, Pension Scheme Profiles 1993*, provides detailed benefit
profiles of each scheme together with a rating guide that allows readers to
get a quick fix on how theirs compares with others. Of particular interest
is the 'target scheme' devised to set a benchmark against which schemes can
be measured.
More than 11m UK employees are members of final salary occupational pension
schemes where the pension is based on three main factors: the definition of
'pensionable pay,' the period of membership, and the pay level at
retirement.
Employees interested in carrying out a pensions health check should refer to
their scheme booklet and compare the definition of their own benefits with
the report's target scheme benefits given below:
Retirement pension: Payable from age 60 based on service and final earnings.
Accrual rate: One-60th of final pay per year of service.
Pensionable earnings: All earnings (apart from overtime etc paid only during
earlier years of employment).
Final pay calculation: The higher of either total earnings in the year
before retirement or average annual earnings over any three-year period
ending within 10 years of retirement, up-rated in line with the retail price
index.
Pensionable service: Total service including maternity leave and certain
temporary absences.
Lump sum on retirement: Inland Revenue maximum ie the maximum amount of
pension that can be converted to tax-free cash - normally 1.5 times final
remuneration after 40 years' service, although this might be subject to
revenue restrictions.
Pension increases: In line with the retail price index.
Ill-health pension: Equivalent to the amount the employee would have
received had he remained in service until normal retirement age, at his
present rate of pay.
Death in service benefits: Should include a dependent adult's pension of
four-ninths the member's total earnings at death, plus pensions for
dependent children. Also, a lump sum of four times earnings.
Death in retirement benefits: Should include a pension worth two-thirds of
the member's pension to be paid to a nominated dependent adult, plus a
pension for any dependent children under age 18.
Scheme leaver benefits: The whole of the preserved pension should be
increased in line with RPI up to retirement.
By law, all this information should be provided. If any is missing, contact
the pensions manager or scheme trustees.
In its analysis of each company scheme, the report awards an overall
'assessment ratio' based on the cost to the employer of the main benefits
compared with the cost of the target scheme. Schemes awarded a rating of 100
per cent match the benefits provided by the target scheme. But no account
was taken of discretionary benefits - those, such as extra pension
increases, which are not an actual right but can become a regular feature of
the scheme.
The definition of pensionable pay is particularly important since your
pension will be calculated as a proportion of these earnings. Some schemes
provide a pension linked to basic pay, while others take into account other
elements - such as, for example, regular overtime. If overtime forms a
significant proportion of your gross earnings and this is not taken into
account in your pensionable pay, you could consider top-up provision through
additional voluntary contributions (AVCs).
The other important point about pensionable pay is to find out just when
your pensionable salary is fixed for the purposes of the calculation. Many
schemes base the pension calculation on the member's gross or basic salary
during the two or three years before retirement. If this is the case, you
should think twice before accepting a less onerous but lower paid position
in the run-up to retirement, since your pension would be based on this
reduced salary.
As the tables show, the generosity of employers surveyed varied
dramatically. Top place went to the Abbey National scheme with 104 per cent
 -the only scheme to provide better benefits than the target. Lowest was the
Rank Organisation plan with just 23 per cent.
So, what can you do if you discover your pension scheme is inadequate? Some
employers and trustees are open to suggestions on benefit improvements,
particularly if there is a pension fund surplus. But it is wise to have a
few DIY ideas up your sleeve.
The first is AVCs. Employees can pay up to 15 per cent of earnings into a
company pension scheme but most pay in about 5 per cent. This leaves scope
to pay 10 per cent (if you can afford it) into the company AVC scheme or
into a free-standing AVC (FSAVC). These are available from life offices but
also from a few building societies and unit trusts.
Like all Inland Revenue-approved pension arrangements, AVCs and FSAVCs are
very tax-efficient, offering tax relief on contributions and tax-free
roll-up of funds. Company AVC schemes tend to be better value because the
employer bears the provider's costs, but FSAVCs offer a wider investment
choice. In both cases, the fund built up by your contributions must normally
be used to buy an annuity.
The company pensions manager will provide details on the AVC scheme, while
an independent adviser will help you choose the best FSAVC. Remember that,
in most cases, your investment will not be available until retirement. If
you need more flexibility, then you could look at other tax-efficient
investments such as personal equity plans (Peps).
Apart from topping-up your pension through AVCs it might be necessary to
boost your life cover, either through some form of family income benefits
plan or a lump sum life assurance policy. Both types of insurance are
available from life offices at relatively modest monthly premiums. Once
again, an independent financial adviser can select the best rates on the
market.

THE DESIRE of many investors for a high income continues to prompt financial
services groups to launch products to satisfy that need.
Morgan Grenfell has produced a fund with a similar structure to Hypo Foreign
&amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan, which attracted Pounds 270m earlier this
year. It will pay 10 per cent a year, which can be tax-free in a Personal
Equity Plan.
The High Income Trust will invest in a combination of UK shares, cash and
loan securities - these are the heart of the product. They are, in essence,
a 'cover' for the trust's real business - writing options against the fund's
shares in order to earn extra income.
An option gives the buyer the right to buy, or sell, a given commodity at a
set price over a set period. In return for this right, the option buyer pays
a premium to the seller, or writer. These premiums will represent the extra
income of Morgan Grenfell's trust.
The loan securities are designed to get round unit trust regulations, which
do not allow managers to distribute option profits to unitholders. The
'interest' income on the loans will effectively be the premium income
repackaged.
Writing options means that the trust is giving up future capital gains for
immediate income. But if it can deliver 10 per cent a year, many investors
will probably not mind.
The normal rule of thumb is that a high return, such as 10 per cent, can
only be achieved at a high risk. Although Morgan Grenfell is not offering
any guarantees, it says the fund will provide protection against a sharp
fall in the market, and the product will not eat up capital to get income.
If Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell can earn 10 per cent for investors (after
charges) without taking much of a risk, it suggests there is a pricing
anomaly in the market, which might eventually disappear.
But private investors cannot hope to understand the intricacies of the
options market; they simply have to trust that major groups such as Morgan
Grenfell and Hypo F &amp; C can deliver what they have promised. Certainly,
nothing has gone wrong with the Hypo F &amp; C fund so far.
For those prepared to take a lower level of income, Morgan Grenfell is
offering a balanced investment, with 50 per cent in the Higher Income fund
and 50 per cent in its existing UK Equity Income fund. This option will pay
7 per cent and give the investor the chance of capital growth; the UK Equity
income fund achieved growth of 90.8 per cent over the five years to
September 1.
The minimum investment in Morgan Grenfell's 10 per cent plan is Pounds 1,000
(Pounds 2,500 for Peps). The charges will be 5 per cent initial and 1.5 per
cent annual. For those who want the 7 per cent income (also Pepable), the
minimum investment is Pounds 2,000; the charges are 5.25 per cent initial
and 1.5 per cent annual.
In both cases, income will be paid quarterly. Meanwhile, Hypo F &amp; C is
offering an offshore option of its Higher Income plan. This will pay income
gross and non-taxpayers can thus earn 10 per cent on sums far larger than
the annual Pounds 6,000 Pep allowance. The minimum investment is Pounds
5,000; initial charge is 5 per cent and annual is 1.5 per cent.

INVESTORS in home income schemes hoping to get compensation after a High
Court ruling in July are having to wait for another court hearing. The
Investors Compensation Scheme, which limits the maximum payout per claim to
Pounds 48,000, and law firm Barnett Sampson have been unable to agree on
interpreting one point of the judgment and have decided to seek
clarification.
Home income plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as
a way to release income from their homes. The schemes involved taking out a
mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. In many cases, the risk of
the investment bonds was not explained and investors who lost money have
grounds for compensation.
In July, Barnett Sampson won extended compensation rights for victims. At
issue was whether those who had taken out a home income plan before the ICS
started on August 28 1988 had any compensation rights.
The ICS argued that claims could be made only by investors who took out a
plan on or after that date. But the court decided that investors can get
compensation for losses occurring as a result of poor advice after August 28
1988, even if they had taken out their plans before that date.
It is on this point that the two sides now have differences of
interpretation. The ICS wants clarification about the date from which
compensation should be calculated and to determine exactly what event would
trigger a liability.
Barnett Sampson says there does not have to be any positive action for an
investor to be eligible for compensation, and that a failure to act by an
independent adviser also can trigger a liability.
Tom Murphy, a Liverpool pensioner, was an investor with Hamilton House
Associates, a Birkenhead-based investment business which was ordered by
Fimbra, the self-regulating body for IFAs, to stop trading in February 1990.
He took out a fixed rate investment bond on June 20 1988; this was meant to
have been secured against property but appears not to have been.
His Pounds 18,000 compensation claim depends on the judgment. 'I am
bewildered,' he says. 'When I read about the judgment in July, I thought my
claim would be all right, but it's now been held up again. I have been
through 3 1/2 years of hell over this.'
Investors who benefited from another point clarified by the High Court
judgment are not having to wait for compensation. The court decided that the
ICS was wrong to propose halving the amount of compensation to a surviving
spouse.

MANY READERS have had an unpleasant experience at the hands of their bank,
building society or insurer and it is rare to receive letters which recount
a happy story.
However, Freddie Earlle, who lives in London, wrote to the Weekend FT to
record his father-in-law's satisfaction with the service he has received at
his building society, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.
'My father-in-law is an active gentleman of advancing years. But
unfortunately, he has moments of confusion,' said Earlle.
During one of these lapses, he wrote to C &amp; G to find out how much money he
had in his account. His letter was unclear and C &amp; G thought he wanted to
close it. They therefore sent him a cheque and closed his account. He
thought the cheque was his statement and therefore filed it away and did
nothing.
'About three months later, he realised his mistake and deposited the cheque
with the building society's local branch, which opened a new account for
him,' said Earlle.
The mistake meant a substantial loss of interest.
Earlle said: 'He asked me to write and explain what had happened. In less
than a week, the society replied. They accepted that Dad had made a genuine
error, backdated the 'new' account, and so ensured no loss of interest. We
cannot thank them enough.'
If other societies take note of this example, Earlle believes, their
customers will feel that their money is in safe hands.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Fund of eastern promise - Unit
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING a risk-averse fund management style in a volatile region like
south-east Asia may sound contradictory. But Adaline Ko, manager of Save &amp;
Prosper's south-east Asia Growth unit trust, has been doing just that for 11
years with considerable success.
The fund was launched in 1978 (Ko joined in 1982) and is one of the largest
in the Far East sector (excluding Japan), with Pounds 185m under management.
Its performance has been consistently above average: it was third best
performing out of 15 funds in its sector over the seven years to September
1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright; 12th out of 26 over five years,
20th out of 43 over three years, and 17th out of 54 over one year. However,
its lower-risk strategy, has kept it from the very top of its sector, as it
is competing with more volatile single country funds.
Management of the fund is carried out by a four-person team at Flemings in
London, which bought Save &amp; Prosper in 1988. The team visits the region
about twice a year for a few weeks at a time, and makes a total of about 200
company visits.
Additional research comes from sister company Jardine Fleming, based in Hong
Kong and with offices throughout the region, as well as other international
securities houses and local brokers.
Investment strategy starts with asset allocation. Quarterly strategy
meetings discuss economic and market fundamentals, and can lead to complete
shifts in direction. The fund's high turnover - which Ko calculates at an
average of 200 per cent a year - is largely attributable to periodic
decisions to withdraw almost completely from one or two markets in favour of
heavy investment in others.
'If you can get certain markets right, you are three-quarters of the way
there,' says Ko. The top-down style is also seen as more appropriate in a
region where company accounting and disclosure standards are not always up
to European or US levels. Most shares move with the market as a whole,
rather than in response to company news.
There have been many changes in the fund's style during the time that Ko has
been involved, including the recent move to concentrate the fund  - it now
holds 88 stocks, compared to 116 two years ago.
Of the top 10 stocks, mostly regional blue-chips which account for 30 per
cent of the fund's holdings, the top three are Hong Kong listed: Hutchison
Whampoa, Cheung Kong Holdings, and HSBC Holdings. Each of them accounts for
more than 4 per cent of the total. Other top 10 companies are: Renong
(Malaysia), United Engineers (Malaysia), ACMA (Singapore), Advanced
Information Services (Thailand), Krung Thai Bank, New World Development
(Hong Kong), and Arab Malaysian Corporation. The largest holdings form a
stable core for the fund - most have been in the portfolio at least two
years, some considerably longer.
The present regional allocation is 29 per cent in Hong Kong, Malaysia 25 per
cent, Singapore 12 per cent, Thailand 15 per cent, Korea 12 per cent,
Philippines 2 per cent and Indonesia 3 per cent. Historically, the fund's
current weightings are low for Hong Kong and high for Malaysia.
The graph shows the fund's performance against the FT-A index for the
Pacific Basin excluding Japan, which covers similar markets but includes
Australia and New Zealand, which do not form a big part of the fund's
portfolio, and excludes Thailand, which does.
One concern for the fund, Ko says, is the risk of becoming trapped in
illiquid markets, particularly the smaller ones such as Indonesia and the
Phillipines. A manager has to balance the possibility of the market rising
against the possibility of becoming stuck when sentiment turns bearish and
volume plummets.
'Before you get in, you have to think if you can get out first. We would
never put a majority of the fund into a market we knew it would be difficult
to get out of, no matter how good it was,' Ko says.
Ko is originally from Hong Kong, and says that a closeness to the culture
can help in understanding how the markets are behaving. At other times
though she has to distance herself from her roots.
Such an instance came in the Chinese crisis of 1989, when student democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square were brutally suppressed. Regional markets,
particularly Hong Kong, reacted strongly to the events. Ko describes
managing the fund during this time as hair-raising. But the decisions she
took proved successful.
Hong Kong's stock market plunged in the early stages of the protests, but
then bounced back. At this point Ko sold a large chunk of her Hong Kong
holdings, reducing them from around 50 per cent of the fund to 20-25 per
cent. The market then started to drop again, and fell even more heavily on
news of the massacre.
Markets in Singapore and Malaysia collapsed in sympathy, but Ko believed
that there was no fundamental reason for this, so she shifted funds
withdrawn from Hong Kong into both markets - in time to see them pick up
again.
Such successes tend to be forgotten, but are a fund manager's job, Ko
accepts. The mistakes loom larger in her mind. One decision she is currently
regretting is moving back into Korea in a big way last year, in expectation
of interest rate cuts and economic recovery. It now seems she made the move
too early - the first wave of recovery came, but has so far failed to take
off, and the market has been hit by a clamp-down on the use of false names
for financial transactions.
The fund has not lost money in Korea so far, but there is an opportunity
cost when other markets in the region are performing well. Ko has scaled the
holding back (from 20 to 12 per cent) and is now expecting a real recovery
early in 1994.
Charges. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent, and the annual is 1.5 per cent.
The current bid-offer spread is 5.99 per cent. The minimum investment is
Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 35 a month. The fund does not qualify for full Pep
investment, so a maximum of Pounds 1,500 can be invested by this route.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonds to browse through
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS ARE not the only kind of sterling bonds. Below Michael Dyson, director
of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets describes some other fixed
interest instruments which might be useful to the private investor (with
details in the table). BZW is a market maker and cannot deal with private
clients direct so those interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.
THERE are many hundreds of sterling bonds to choose from and a growing
number of stockbrokers and advisers are making excellent use of direct bond
holdings. Nevertheless, UK investors are still a long way behind investors
on the continent and in the US.
The income and final capital value of a bond will be known at the time of
purchase and will not change. In addition, any capital gains that arise on
the following instruments will not give rise to a CGT liability (except in
the case of zero dividend preference shares, which are not bonds, but are
effectively fixed rate securities).
The following illustrations highlight several diverse investor demands and
the sterling bonds we would recommend as a possible solution.
The retired investor who wants a very high income but does not want to
surrender his capital to an annuity.
A portfolio of perpetuals (fixed income instruments which will never be
repaid) would be ideal for this investor.
Our recommendations would include Coventry Building Society PIBS, currently
paying an income of 9.19 per cent and the Birmingham Corp's 3.5 per cent
bonds, priced at 43.25 to yield 8.09 per cent.
The latter were originally issued in 1881 and are redeemable at 100 at any
time on one year's notice.
An investor who wants to retire in 2002, and as a higher rate taxpayer, does
not want to receive any further investment income before retirement.
Zero dividend preference shares could be appealing for this investor as they
produce no taxable income and the capital gain is deferred until after
retirement, at which point the investor will have a lower overall tax
liability from other sources.
In this instance, we would recommend the Schroder Split Investment Trust
Zeros, where the price will rise from the current level of 108.5 to 202.76
on repayment in 2002. The gain equates to a gross redemption yield of 7.57
per cent, equivalent to a net return of 6.96 per cent, assuming inflation at
5 per cent and CGT of 25 per cent. The nearest comparable gilt offers 6.95
per cent gross and 3.44 per cent net.
Also attractive for this investor would be the Henderson Eurotrust zeros at
the slightly lower, but better covered, yield of 7.45 per cent. The
Henderson zeros will rise from the current level of 36 to 70 in 2002.
Another zero which we find attractive (although it is not a solution for
this particular problem) is the Sphere Investment Trust issue. The wind-up
date of the trust is the end of October 1995. The repayment price of the
zeros at that date is 107.5, giving a yield to redemption of 7.33 per cent
gross on the current price of 92. (The net figure in the table is based on
the same assumptions as for the Schroder zero.)
The beauty of a share such as the Sphere zero is that there are already
sufficient assets to repay the final price in full. In other words, even if
the investment trust fails to grow, the zero's repayment is safe.
An offshore investor seeking a long term high income.
The Royal Bank of Scotland 9.5 per cent Eurosterling bond trades at 108.375
and will provide a gross income of 8.75 per cent per annum until at least
2018 (when RBS has the right to repay the bond). This is equivalent to a
gross redemption yield of 8.5 per cent.
The investor may wish to balance his investment with a purchase of another
bond such as Woolwich's 7 per cent 1998 Eurosterling bond at 100 to give a 7
per cent income yield for five years (GRY of 6.89 per cent).
The investor who is concerned that inflation will rise again.
The second Severn Bridge, currently under construction, was funded by the
issue of Severn River Crossing 6 per cent index-linked debenture.
Trading at 119, this issue offers a very high real return of 4.66 per cent
over and above the rate of inflation, compared to 3.24 per cent from the
equivalent index-linked gilt.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Low-cost endowment picture changes -
Lautro's revision of rates to determine benefit illustrations looks set to
hike premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIUMS on low-cost endowment policies could rise from November 1 when life
companies will be required to switch to a new illustration basis.
The premiums are determined by assuming an investment rate over the term of
the contract, so that the premiums, less charges and mortality costs,
accumulated at this assumed rate of return will be sufficient to repay the
mortgage total.
The higher the assumed rate of investment return, the lower the premium.
However, if the life company does not achieve that return (and the higher
the rate, the greater the chance of not achieving it) then the ultimate
maturity value will fall short of the value of the mortgage and the
housebuyer will have to make up the difference.
However, unless this feature is pointed out to housebuyers, many would not
appreciate the potential danger of underperformance on the maturity value
and the financial consequences to them. One purpose of illustrating benefits
is to indicate the downside as well as the upside in a life assurance
contract.
The basis under which life companies prepare benefit illustrations is
determined by Lautro, the industry regulator. Under the present system,
Lautro lays down the values of all the parameters used in the calculations -
the investment returns, the mortality rates and the charges.
Benefit illustrations currently have to be shown for two investment returns
 -the objective being to indicate variation in benefits from different
investment returns. The rates for life assurance contracts are based on net
investment returns of 7 per cent and 10.5 per cent.
Life companies can show benefits on other investment returns, provided they
fall between the two rates.
A common, but by no means universal, rate of return used to calculate
low-cost endowment premiums is 7.5 per cent net. When this is shown
alongside the present Lautro illustration basis - as shown in the table -
the maturity shortfall at 7 per cent appears insignificant - if one can
regard Pounds 3,600 as insignificant.
But under the revised Lautro basis, the illustrations must be calculated on
new rates of return - 5 per cent and 10 per cent net. Those figures
highlight the effect of investment underperformance, as seen from the table.
At 5 per cent, the maturity value would be just Pounds 34,400 - only 68.8
per cent of the mortgage amount. In this example, the houseowner would have
to find Pounds 15,600 from other sources to pay off the mortgage.
Of course, under modern low-cost endowment contracts, the premiums are not
fixed throughout the term. The progress of the contract is checked
periodically and if there is an investment shortfall the premiums are
increased.
Nevertheless, many housebuyers taking out low-cost endowments do not expect
to pay higher premiums at a later date. Such a change invalidates any
comparisons made with the costs of repayment mortgages.
Life companies, particularly those currently assuming a rate higher than 7.5
per cent, are considering whether to calculate low-cost endowment premiums
on a lower assumed investment return. The shortfall with the 5 per cent
illustration would then not look so bad.
The eventual maturity value on a low-cost endowment, for those contracts
which are held to maturity, will depend on the actual investment return
achieved by the life company over the term of the contract. Neither the
officials at Lautro nor life company investment managers can predict what
that return will be.
What the new illustration basis does show, however, is that investment
returns over the remaining years of this century and the early years of the
next century are not expected to show the same high returns achieved in the
1980s, in spite of the UK equity market reaching new heights this year. It
also shows investors the ultimate cost if the life company concerned fails
to achieve the assumed investment and the likelihood of premiums being
increased in the future.
Hence, those housebuyers who still intend to, or are persuaded to, repay
their mortgages through low-cost endowments should look carefully at the
assumed investment return - it will be shown on the quotation - and the size
of the shortfall shown on the 5 per cent illustration.
Low-cost endowments could take an even harder knock sometime in 1994 when
illustrations will have to be produced on an own charge basis, when the life
company must use its own charges in calculating the benefits and not the
standard Lautro charges.
Periodic surveys of low-cost endowments in Money Management include
illustrations on an own charge basis using the same rate of return. The
latest survey revealed differences of one-third between the life companies
with the lowest and highest charges.

<TEXT>
CURRENCY effects should help Inchcape, the international services and
marketing group, to report on Monday a lift in half-year pre-tax profits
from Pounds 117m to more than Pounds 140m. The recovery in UK car sales will
be balanced by the downturn in the continental European market. Continuing
growth in Hong Kong will also mask more difficult trading conditions in
Japan, but the group will be quizzed closely over the future of China's
experiment in rapid economic development.
British Aerospace is expected to return in the black when it reports its
interim results on Wednesday. Analysts expect it to show a small pre-tax
interim profit ranging from Pounds 20m to Pounds 50m, against an interim
loss of Pounds 129m last time. The figures will confirm the company's
gradual turn-round, although core military profits are likely to show a
decline. Losses in the civil aircraft side of the business will be covered
by the hefty provisions made last year. Monday also sees Dalgety announcing
its full-year results. Something between a conservative Pounds 119m and
Pounds 123m is expected, but the pre-tax figure will mask a motley
collection of divisional results.
Agribusiness and ingredients should be good, although the consumer goods,
snacks and pet-care sides will probably have performed less well in tough
and ever more competitive trading environments. The final dividend is
forecast at between 12.3p and 13.65p for a total between 20.2p and 21.55p,
against 19.5p last time.
On Thursday, United Biscuits is expected to report only a modest first-half
recovery after the profits collapse inflicted by the US cookie wars a year
ago. Forecasts range from Pounds 70m to Pounds 78m, compared with Pounds 70m
last time. Any improvement by Keebler, the US snacks and biscuits division,
is expected to be offset by margin pressures on McVitie's in the UK and a
flat performance by Smiths, the Australian snacks business acquired last
year.
Also on Thursday, Laporte, the speciality chemicals group which in January
snatched Evode, the chemicals and plastics group from the jaws of Wassall,
is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 46m and
Pounds 49m. Last time it made Pounds 44.5m.
On Wednesday Taylor Woodrow is expected to swing back into the black with
interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10.5m compared with a Pounds 16m
loss last year.

<TEXT>
ALLIED Dunbar has launched a distribution bond, a unit-linked investment
where income is paid in the form of more units. The bond is structured into
two funds: Capital, split between equities, property, and gilts; and Cash.
Twice a year, the income on the Capital fund is transferred to Cash.
Withdrawals are then taken mainly from the latter.
Investors can take withdrawals as a fixed percentage each year; as a fixed
amount of cash each year; or simply the amount distributed from Capital to
Cash. Payments can be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. Minimum
investment is Pounds 5,000; investments of more than Pounds 15,000 get an
extra 1 per cent allocation of units. The initial charge is 5 per cent and
the annual management charge is 1 3/8 per cent.
* * *
LEEDS &amp; Holbeck building society has launched a Guaranteed Equity bond which
offers investors who are basic-rate taxpayers 75 per cent of the rise in the
FT-SE over five years, or a minimum rise of 25 per cent. The return equates
to 60 per cent of the rise in the Footsie for top rate-payers and 100 per
cent for non-taxpayers. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 and withdrawals
can be made after two years.
* * *
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society is launching a five year 'step-up'
investment bond where the rate of interest grows annually. In year one, it
will pay 6.25 per cent gross (4.69 per cent net); year two, 6.5 per cent
(4.87 per cent); year three, 6.75 per cent (5.06 per cent); year four 7.25
per cent (5.44 per cent);and year five, 8 per cent (6 per cent). Minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 2,500 for those who want monthly
income. No withdrawals are allowed during the term, but closure is permitted
subject to the loss of 180 days' interest.
* * *
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester building society is offering two new mortgages for
the first-time buyer. One option is a 4 per cent discount off the society's
variable rate until June 30 1994, resulting in a rate of 3.99 per cent (APR
8.1 per cent). The fixed-rate option over the same period is 4.95 per cent
(APR 8.1 per cent). After June 30, the loan reverts to C&amp;G's variable rate;
those redeeming within three years will be charged a fee equivalent to four
months' interest. Both options are available to buyers with a 10 per cent
deposit and seeking a loan of less than Pounds 70,000.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The price of knowledge - Bethan
Hutton on ways for parents to meet soaring university costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOUR child started at senior school this week, finding the money for an
eventual university course might not be uppermost in your mind. But, as
growing numbers of teenagers opt to stay in full-time education after age 18
and more parents need to find thousands of pounds for a student offspring's
living costs, now could be the time to start planning.
While you can choose whether to pay fees for an independent school, you will
not have a similar choice about paying for your child's living expenses when
it comes to university: grants are means-tested and based on parents' gross
income, with deductions allowed for interest on mortgages up to Pounds
30,000, and some other expenses eligible for tax relief.
Parents with a joint residual income of more than about Pounds 14,000 must
start contributing to their children's maintenance at university. With an
income of more than about Pounds 33,000, they must meet one child's full
costs.
Some parents may have been alarmed by the London School of Economics'
announcement earlier this year that it was considering charging students (or
their parents) top-up tuition fees. While the proposal was rejected, the
possibility remains for other institutions. Later this month, the Committee
of University Vice-chancellors and Principals is due to discuss four
proposals to change the way higher education is funded, all of which would
involve graduates paying for courses in some way.
The option most likely to be favoured is one based on the
recently-introduced Australian system where students take out a loan -
either interest-free or with a low rate - to pay tuition fees in advance.
These are provided by the government and they are paid back through the
national insurance or tax system once students graduate and find jobs.
Graduates on low incomes can defer payment.
In the UK now, most students struggle to manage even with a full grant (now
Pounds 2,845 in London and Pounds 2,265 elsewhere) and the maximum student
loan (Pounds 940 in London, Pounds 800 elsewhere). Total state support has
not kept pace with inflation, particularly when social security benefits are
considered - students can no longer claim income support during vacations,
or housing benefit.
Grants for students in London are weighted to take account of higher housing
costs, but rents can be almost as high in some other university towns, such
as Brighton and Oxford, where students get no extra help.
If you are the kind of parent who would prefer to shield your children from
such debt, you could have to find Pounds 4,000 or more per student a year -
similar to independent day school fees. Tuition fees, if imposed, could push
up costs to the level of exclusive boarding schools.
Financial planning for school fees has spawned its own small industry.
Planning for university costs is not yet so widespread, but interest is
growing as more parents realise how much they are likely to have to spend.
Specialist school fee advisers usually can help with higher education, as
can most non-specialist independent financial advisers.
Making provisions in advance can also reduce the amount you actually pay if
you make the right choice of investments. Flexibility is greatest if you can
start planning at least 10 years in advance; but even five years ahead, you
can take advantage of some tax-free savings schemes.
The range of products to consider will depend on each family's
circumstances, but it usually includes personal equity plans (Peps),
pensions, building society accounts, tax-exempt special savings accounts
(Tessas), National Savings, unit and investment trusts, and with-profits
endowment policies.
Some insurance companies offer educational planning advice, but their
solutions tend to be biased towards endowment policies rather than using the
full range of investments available to independent financial advisers.
Advisers stress the importance of diversifying, and tend to emphasise less
risky investments. Tony Murrell, of financial adviser Fraser Marr, usually
goes mainly for low-risk products, even for parents starting to save very
early on. He does not recommend that more than 50 per cent of the portfolio
should be put into equity-based investments - the stock market has a nasty
habit of taking a dive just as parents need to draw on their investment.
Charles Levitt-Scrivener, divisional director of Towry Law, which has
produced an information sheet on planning for university costs, says parents
of potential university students can be divided into three categories: low
earners, whose children are likely to get a full grant; medium earners, who
will have to pay some maintenance; and high earners, whose children probably
will not be eligible for any grant assistance.
He says the first group is unlikely to be able to save much, even if it
wants to provide additional support on top of the grant to keep its children
out of debt. Planning is a realistic possibility for the second group, but
care must be taken that savings do not reduce the amount of grant
assessable. Tax-free investments - such as Peps, Tessas, with-profits
endowments and some forms of National Savings - should be used as far as
possible. Those in the third group must resign themselves to paying the full
costs but planning can make things easier. The range of possibilities is
similar to the second group, with the addition of some of the more
sophisticated investment options, such as offshore roll-up funds.
Levitt-Scrivener says these can be useful because no tax is payable during
the lifetime of the investment. If the parents make a gift of the investment
to their children, tax will be assessed against their income when the
investment is cashed - and this income will usually be low enough to avoid
paying tax.
The two main National Savings products recommended are the yearly plan and
children's bonds, both of which are tax-free if held for five years. The
yearly plan allows parents to save up to Pounds 400 a month for 12 months,
while the maximum deposit in the children's bond, available to under-16s, is
Pounds 1,000.
Tessas, available at most banks and building societies, earn tax-free
interest if the capital is not touched for five years. A maximum of Pounds
9,000 can be invested, staggered over five years. It is also sensible to
keep back-up savings in another building society account with fewer
penalties for early withdrawal.
A maximum of Pounds 9,000 a year can be invested in Peps, of which Pounds
6,000 can be in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company one.
Income and capital gains from Peps are tax-free. Income from unit and
investment trusts is taxable, but capital gains are not counted when the
grant entitlement is being calculated.
Business expansion schemes, such as the popular contracted-exit ones offered
by a number of universities, are a highly tax-efficient investment at the
moment, but they are due to be abolished at the end of the year.
They could be worth thinking about for higher-rate taxpayers who expect to
have a child at university in five years' time, when the present batch of
schemes matures.
Parents who expect to qualify for some grant may want to consider increasing
contributions to a personal pension scheme, or additional voluntary
contributions to a company or free-standing scheme, as this will reduce the
amount of residual income against which the grant is assessed.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: S&amp;P slashes card rate - Investment
group throws down challenge to bigger rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IAN LINDSEY is more than just positive about the new Visa credit card
launched this week by Save &amp; Prosper, the investment group of which he is a
director. 'Customers would be absolutely stupid not to apply,' he says.
S&amp;P's card undercuts the competition significantly. The annualised
percentage rate of 14.6 per cent compares with 22.9 APR with Barclaycard and
23.9 APR on National Westminster's Visa card. These are the two largest
issuers, with just under 13m cards between them compared with S&amp;P's 100,000.
S&amp;P customers can also choose their statement date and apply for a
Mastercard at no extra charge.
So, are there any drawbacks? Until this week, S&amp;P applicants could choose
between a fee-free card with an interest rate of 23.1 APR, or a card with a
Pounds 10 annual fee and an interest rate of 21.3 APR.
These cards have now been dropped for new applicants, although Lindsey says
those who have them will not have their terms and conditions changed.
The Pounds 12 annual fee - Pounds 2 higher than the old one - is reflected
in the APR figure, which also includes the monthly rate of interest. But it
does not take into account the date from which interest is charged.
Unlike the other issuers, who levy interest from the date of transactions
for those not paying off their bill in full each month, S&amp;P in the past
charged interest only from the statement date - which is more favourable for
customers. It says this meant a rate 3 per cent lower than for cards with
the same monthly interest rate and annual fee, but that this difference was
not reflected in the APR figure.
'The APR is said to be a guide to the cost of credit but, in our experience,
it is one of the most misleading statistics which parliament has ever
required banks to quote,' says Lindsey.
The group has called regularly for a change but has been told by the
Department of Trade and Industry that a new formula would be too
complicated.
Lindsey says there was no choice but to charge new cardholders interest,
where appropriate, from the transaction date.
S&amp;P denies it will raise the rate in due course, as rivals have claimed. 'If
the general level of interest rates remains unchanged for the next decade,
then our rate will not change; that's a cast-iron guarantee,' vows Lindsey -
who believes his rivals overcharge customers.
Paul Bateman, S&amp;P's chief executive, says the rate can be sustained because
the group's operations are linked to the money market, which reflects base
rates of 6 per cent at present.
Some of the associated charges on the new card can be higher than for other
issuers. S&amp;P could charge Pounds 25 to replace a stolen or missing card and
Pounds 15 for obtaining a carbon copy; Barclays issues new cards free and
charges only Pounds 3 for a carbon copy.
Lindsey says, however, that these charges will usually be applied only when
customers regularly (and wrongly) challenge transactions or if they lose
their card often. He stresses that they are intended to combat fraud.
Applicants for the new card must own their home, be a UK resident, have a
regular income and a clean credit record. Those earning less than Pounds
10,000 a year are unlikely to qualify. The Pounds 12 annual fee is waived
until March 1994 for those applying before November 26.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: I'd like you to meet my friend Zoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look, here's the deal. I run the business, you own it. At the end of the
year we divvy up the profits. You get what's left over after ploughing back
some money into the business.
Sounds fair? There's just one little wrinkle, a technicality really. Times
are tough, so I'd rather you didn't clean out the Pounds 20 in the petty
cash tin. Instead, I'll give you this bit of paper. Here, I'll write Pounds
30 on it.
That means that instead of just owning 100 per cent of the business, you now
own, er, 100 per cent of the business including a piece of paper. Not good
enough? OK, my mate Zoot will buy the paper from you and pass it on to
someone else. And you'll get Pounds 30, less a little something for his
trouble.
But here's the thing: the taxman doesn't want to know about it. So
everybody's happy. I'm putting the cash to good use - the Roller's looking a
bit scruffy - you're putting one over on the taxman, and Zoot's found
himself a nice sideline.
What's that? Bit puzzled? I know, this corporate finance stuff is tricky.
Let's start again. I run the business . . .
* * * This conversation, or something like it, has been taking place on
every street corner in the City of London over the past couple of weeks.
Perfectly respectable finance directors, pin-stripes and all, have been
elbowing each other off the pavement in Threadneedle St, handing out bits of
paper with engraved curlicues around the side and the words Enhanced Scrip
Dividend at the top. Since the beginning of September, bean-counters from
P&amp;O, BTR, Enterprise Oil, T&amp;N, Burmah Castrol and Ladbroke - all substantial
companies - have been thrusting their pieces of paper at passing
shareholders.
On Thursday, for example, BTR declared an interim dividend of 4.95p (up 6.5
per cent), but offered a scrip alternative of shares worth 7.425p. If you're
a BTR shareholder and you want want to hold on to your new shares, that's
fine. If you want to take the standard dividend, instead of the scrip
alternative, that's fine too.
But if you want to turn your 7.425p's worth of paper into real money, then
BTR's friends at Barclays de Zoete Wedd will give you 7.2765p for it, 47 per
cent more than you'd get by opting for the boring old cash dividend.
Advance Corporation Tax, which a company must pay when it hands out a cash
dividend, doesn't apply to the scrip alternatives. So a company that would
otherwise pay out more in ACT than it can offset later against its
mainstream corporation tax can use an enhanced scrip dividend to avoid this
extra tax burden.
In the short run, this is one of those wheezes from which everyone gains,
except the tax man (and investment trusts, which have a special tax status
that makes it hard for them to take up enhanced scrip dividends on the
shares in their portfolio). But among the throng on the Threadneedle St
pavement, you can find a clutch of investors furrowing their brows, and a
bulky man in hush puppies peering uncertainly at his Tube map.
The investors are worrying if this is not simply a way for managements to
achieve small-scale rights issues the market might otherwise have been
sticky about. And the doubters have a point: as the charts show, though
share prices usually rose at first for the pioneers of this device, back in
the spring, the trend relative to the market for some of them has since been
downwards. Still, when Coats Viyella came back with its second enhanced
scrip dividend on Thursday, the market didn't blink. The shares rose 1p on
the day and closed on Friday at 257 1/2 p, up 6p on the week.
More of a threat, perhaps, is the bulky figure at the back of the crowd: Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. He may not be able to find Bill
Bentley's oyster-bar unaided, but he can spot a legal loophole when he sees
one. Since he has the opportunity to do something about such devices in
November's Budget, companies are making the most of it while they can. T&amp;N
and Enterprise Oil, for example, used their interim results this week to
offer enhanced scrip in lieu of the dividends they'd usually be paying at
year-end.
The interim reporting season isn't just about dividends, of course. It's
also an opportunity for companies to tell their shareholders about how
they're doing - and where they're going. Two big companies that reported
this week sent investors mixed messages.
Glaxo told us that its wonder drug, Zantac, is even more of a wonder than
everyone already knew: despite the product's maturity, its sales continue to
grow at splendid rates. But by raising the dividend 29 per cent, the company
focused renewed attention on the question of whether it is able to find
enough lucrative investments to absorb the Pounds 1.8bn in liquid funds its
success has generated. Glaxo's spectacular share-price slide relative to the
market has stopped, for the moment at least. That leaves managers and
investors free to ponder, calmly, a tricky question: if a company has a
product outrageously blessed by fortune, how can shareholders be sure of
getting the maximum return from it?
Cadbury Schweppes clearly thinks it has found the way to invest its
shareholders' money effectively: by buying its way into third place in a two
horse race. It launched a Pounds 324m rights issue, with two thirds of the
money going to finance an agreed takeover for A&amp;W Brands, the leading US
producer of root beer. Together with its 25.9 per cent stake in Dr Pepper,
maker of a soft drink which is even more of an acquired taste, this gives
Cadbury hopes of assembling a third force in the US carbonated beverage
market. Question: if you could choose the two companies in the world to be
number three behind, would you pick Coke and Pepsi? Well, at least they
didn't announce an enhanced scrip dividend.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: Bonds that offer a saving grace - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD your savings be in ICI's Eurosterling 1995 issue, instead of
deposited in the building society? The idea is not as way out as it sounds.
In the US and on the Continent, it is quite common for private investors to
own corporate bonds, or those issued by local authorities. Years of
inflation have knocked the bond-owning habit out of the UK investing public.
But if the 1990s really are to be an era of low inflation and low short-term
interest rates, UK investors may be attracted by the corporate bond sector.
Investors have certainly shown enthusiasm for the permanent interest-bearing
shares (PIBS) issued by building societies. These securities are actually a
good deal more risky than many of the other corporate bonds on issue - which
is why, of course, they pay a higher yield. PIBS are at the end of the queue
when it comes to repaying building society creditors; most corporate bonds
are close to the front of the creditors' queue.
Whether investors understand the risk is hard to say; some may have bought
PIBS in the belief that they are just a different type of high interest
account. But the name 'building society' is obviously a source of much
comfort; it is a long time since any investor lost out from a building
society collapse.
If, however, you can buy PIBS because of the comfort offered by the name of,
say, the Leeds building society, why not buy a bond issue, with much greater
security, from Midland bank? The yield might be lower than on a PIBS issue,
but it will be higher than on a gilt of the same maturity.
The main risk, when buying a long-dated corporate bond, is that the company
concerned might not survive the many economic cycles over the coming
decades. On issues of a similar maturity, the higher the yield on the bond
concerned, the more the market is worried about the company's potential to
survive. Conversely, if investors want the security of a blue-chip name,
they must accept a lower yield.
Apart from the credit risk, there is also obviously a market risk of bond
prices falling. Such has been the strength of the rally in bond prices over
the past three years, fuelled by lower interest rates and falling inflation,
that there must be a chance of a setback. But if investors are prepared to
hold the bond until maturity, at least they know precisely what nominal
return they will achieve. With many issues trading above face value, buying
bonds may involve converting some capital into income.
There are many bond issues available, and other types of security - such as
zero dividend preference shares - which may offer similar attractions to
investors. On page V, Michael Dyson, a director of BZW Capital Markets,
highlights a number of issues which he feels might be attractive to private
investors.
Coincidentally, BZW's parent company, Barclays, launched a Pounds 100m
Eurosterling bond issue this week. It will yield around 8.8 per cent, well
above the returns available on cash. The bond has no repayment date,
although Barclays has an option to repay it in 2017. Eurosterling bonds are
normally issued in bearer form (which some private investors do not like for
security reasons); the Barclays issue is also available in registered form.
IF YOU ARE at all interested in investment, you must have noticed that world
stock markets were reaching record highs in August. You will probably also
have realised that bonds have enjoyed a powerful rally, with the yield on US
Treasuries falling below 6 per cent. In short, bond and equity investors
have rarely enjoyed such happy times. So why, this week, did the Prudential,
the UK's largest life insurance company, make a provision against further
bonus cuts on its with-profits policies?
The reason dates back to the late 1980s when bonus rates were chased up by
insurance companies eager to get a larger slice of the lucrative endowment
mortgage market. The companies got used to an era when investment returns
averaged between 15 to 20 per cent a year - and set their bonuses
accordingly. Despite the recent rally, the 1990s have not matched those
returns and bonuses need to be cut. In effect, policyholders are seeing the
downside of the smoothing process, often touted as a benefit of endowment
policies.
Prudential started the adjustment earlier than most; it was one of the few
to cut bonuses in the 1991 season, after the battering taken by stock
markets in the 1990s. Other companies hoped that 1990 would prove an
aberration and maintained their payouts; the present adjustment might,
accordingly, be sharper.
Holders of 10-year policies have tended to suffer most because short-term
market movements have a greater effect on short-term policies. This could
come as a shock to those who raced to buy policies in the months leading up
to the abolition of life assurance premium relief in 1984.
The bad news for existing policyholders is that bonus cuts are likely to
continue for some years as the industry adjusts gradually to the new
conditions (assuming low inflation and low interest rates prevail). Of
course, returns on other investments have also dropped. But a unit trust,
for example, does not carry the historical baggage of an endowment policy;
gains are not transferred between generations of investors.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: Gold prices still in decline - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices continued to decline this week. On Friday afternoon, gold was
fixed at Dollars 351.50 a troy ounce in London, after a morning fixing of
Dollars 356. The price has tumbled from a high of Dollars 406.70 an ounce at
the peak of the recent rally on August 2. It has fallen about Dollars 15 so
far this month, and is now back to levels last seen in April.
One of the factors in Friday's price fall was an unexpected drop in the US
producer price index. Recent trading has been driven largely by investment
funds using computer investment programmes in the New York market, as
physical demand for gold from traditional consumers in the Middle and Far
East has been weakened by the high prices.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: DAX index closes slightly down on the week - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's move on Thursday to cut key interest rates by half a
percentage point had been widely anticipated by German stock markets. The
30-share DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 4.48 points that day to 1,880.81,
rather than rising as might have been expected. The fall was attributed to
an unexpected strengthening of the D-Mark against the US dollar, which could
hit export earnings.
The DAX index closed yesterday down 3.3 per cent on the week at 1,861.44.
German equities have been falling since reaching a record high at the end of
August, after a three-month rally.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: P&amp;O steers a cautious course - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation Company could have a lesson for the
market as a whole. Like many UK companies which have reported results in the
past few weeks, the cautious tone of its trading statement appeared at odds
with the gathering confidence that economic recovery is under way.
The City was disappointed with P&amp;O's 11 per cent decline in net pre-tax
profits to Pounds 80.1m and marked the shares down by 49p. They closed
yesterday at 611p.
An indignant Lord Sterling, the chairman, said that anyone who bothered to
read the annual report would have known that the UK economic upturn was
taking longer than expected and would not have allowed their expectations to
race away.
'It is a delusion to think we can surge ahead while Germany and France
remain deep in recession,' he declared.
P&amp;O mirrors many aspects of the UK economy with its house-building,
construction and property operations, while its passenger ferries also are
exposed to consumer trends. Sterling's message that the recovery is patchy
is, therefore, worrying news for shareholders.
The only significant benefit derived from the end of the recession has been
in terms of increased volumes, not in pre-tax profits before disposals.
Investors are being wooed with the prospect of a big dividend. This cannot
be justified by the decline in net profits but, instead, in terms of the
ambitious investment programme which, over the past six years, has totalled
around Pounds 4bn.
Half of the spending has been used to expand the company's operations in
transport and shipping. P&amp;O hopes to increase significantly its 8.5 per cent
return on capital employed.
There is, however, unlikely to be any big return from the new shipping fleet
until well into the next century.
That might be good news in the long term but it is not balancing the
short-term needs demanded by the City. Ian Wild, transport analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The market wants short-term performance and
long-term growth. P&amp;O is delivering on the latter but not the former.'
To be fair to P&amp;O, it has shored up the balance sheet since it most felt the
strain from the capital spending programme back in August 1991. At that
stage it chose to ask investors for Pounds 604m through a rights issue to
cut gearing which started that year at 80 per cent but rose by the halfway
stage to nearly 100 per cent.
After the sale of Sutcliffe, the contract caterer, borrowings fell from
Pounds 1.89bn at the end of December 1992 to Pounds 1.73bn at the end of
June, representing gearing of 70 per cent.
Further disposals are expected to follow this week's announcement of the
sale of Buck and Hickman, a distributor of engineers' supplies, to Charles
Baynes for Pounds 32.5m.
A scrip dividend further eases the pressure on the balance sheet since it
effectively works as a minor rights issue. If all shareholders take up the
scrip dividend alternative the group would retain cash of Pounds 163m.
This represents a saving on the 1993 dividend of Pounds 128m and a further
Pounds 35m of advance corporation tax. Sterling says he would have been
'daft' to have thrown away the chance of conserving cash.
The scrip dividend could, however, only defer financial problems. If taken
up fully, it will expand P&amp;O's equity by about 6 per cent - which will prove
expensive to finance given the stock's yield of 6.5 per cent.
P&amp;O could accelerate its disposal programme to generate more cash, or embark
on a more radical solution by demerging its property and construction
interests. The problem with both options is that they would deprive the
company of more of its stable earning contributions.
A more robust economic recovery would help. But as Sterling said earlier
this week, that is unlikely.
The company's investment could pay off in the long term but, for the
immediate future, its performance is unlikely to recommend it to investors.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: And then the weather turned gloomy, too - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a long and mostly rewarding ride, equity investors have unhitched
their cart from the bond market bandwagon, at least for now. It was a wise
move, because the road had become decidedly bumpy this week.
All summer, stock prices have been following bonds higher on the simple
premise that higher bond prices mean lower interest rates. Lower rates
stimulate economic growth and spur investors to switch their money out of
low-yielding short-term assets into other potentially more rewarding
investments, like equities.
On Tuesday, however, equity investors stopped paying attention to what bond
prices were doing. On that day (the first trading day of the
holiday-shortened week), bond prices soared, yet stocks dropped sharply. The
same happened on Wednesday. Over the two days, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average lost more than 50 points, yet the benchmark 30-year bond climbed
more than a point, pushing the yield down to a record low of 5.87 per cent.
On Thursday, the bond market suddenly slammed on the brakes and shifted into
reverse as rumours surfaced that Congress was considering re-imposing a
withholding tax on foreign investors' holdings of US government securities.
Although insiders on Capitol Hill in Washington later insisted it was highly
unlikely that such a tax would ever be passed, the story was enough to send
the 30-year bond plummeting by more than a point.
The losses erased almost all of the week's gains and sent the yield back
close to 6 per cent. The stock markets, however, ignored this apparent
setback and share prices ended Thursday unchanged.
The pattern was repeated yesterday when unexpectedly good news on inflation
 -the producer prices index plunged 0.6 per cent in August - breathed new
life into bonds, sending the 30-year up more than a point and the yield back
down to 5.88 per cent. Stocks appeared unperturbed by the bond market's
yo-yo-ing and by midday yesterday were trading marginally above Thursday's
closing values.
The temporary de-coupling of the stock and bond markets is a reflection of
the fact that equity investors, already nervous about the extent and pace of
the stock markets' recent gains, have been growing equally apprehensive
about the extraordinary performance of Treasury securities. Of the two
summer rallies, the bond market's arguably looks the more overdone.
A small, but growing, band of Wall Street analysts seems to think so. It is
warning that a substantial correction in fixed-income prices could be around
the corner, especially if economic growth later this year picks up pace
faster than anticipated. As one strategist put it this week: 'The drop in
interest rates was telling us we're heading into a recession. But if you
look at most economists' predictions, no one is looking for less than 2.5
per cent growth in GDP.'
Seasonal factors may also have played a part in the stock markets' poor
performance this week. It escaped nobody's notice that New York's weather -
which had been hot, dry and bright all summer, right up to and including
Monday's Labor Day holiday (which marks the official end of summer for all
Americans) - turned cool and damp on Tuesday.
Like the weather, stock market sentiment traditionally turns gloomy as
autumn approaches. Investors have long memories and know that autumn - and
October, particularly - can be the season of nasty surprises. Although this
wariness may be steeped more in superstition than fact, there are some solid
reasons for investors to tread carefully over the coming months.
The political environment will liven up soon, with President Clinton facing
tough battles on two important fronts: his plan for reforming the country's
health-care system and the fight for the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Both battles will be followed closely by financial markets. The
third-quarter reporting season is also on the horizon, and investors are not
sure what to expect.
Second-quarter results were not bad - but nor were they that good. Although
there have not been too many profits warnings from companies recently, there
is a feeling that the string of disappointingly weak economic statistics
released over the past few months could show up in lower-than-expected
earnings.
One area of the economy where Wall Street is confidently predicting a good
third quarter is the commercial banking industry. After a strong run early
in the year, bank stocks were overlooked by investors in the summer rally.
This week, however, banks suddenly returned to favour as several analysts
selected the sector for attention and predicted healthy third-quarter
earnings.

ONE AFTER another, new emerging markets funds are being launched. They make
up one of the hottest investment sectors of the moment, and some of the
closed-end funds are selling at above their underlying asset value, a sure
sign of excess demand. In the short run there are danger signals evident
here.
The new money is usually being channelled into small and illiquid stock
markets around the world (although one or two 'emerging' markets are
becoming quite large: Hong Kong's market capitalisation is bigger than
Italy's, Mexico is bigger than Belgium). In a small market place a flood of
incoming money will effectively create its own capital gains for a while,
but it is bound to push prices above their sustainable value, creating the
inevitability of a shakeout.
It rarely pays an investor to chase a fashion, even if the fundamental case
is a good one; a better opportunity will be presented to the buyer who waits
patiently, although he may need to be brave enough to invest under the
shadow of revolution, earthquake or financial scandal. Certainly, August was
a good month for the fringe markets. You could have made 26 per cent in
dollar terms during the month in Turkey and 23 per cent in Indonesia. On the
other hand, in Venezuela . . . but let's not discuss Venezuela.
If markets emerge strongly enough they can join the big league. Not so long
ago Tokyo was an emerging market. Little more than 30 years ago shares in
promising little companies like Sony and Toyota could be picked up on
price-earnings ratios in the low single figures. Now Tokyo is the
second-biggest market in the world (having been the biggest at its peak in
the late 1980s) but Japanese equities sell on extraordinarily expensive
ratings and the Japanese economic growth rate has slowed to 1 per cent.
Here we have the point, because emerging markets are about growth. The
developed world will be lucky to show a growth rate of 1.5 per cent in 1993,
but in the first half of the year the real GNP of China is estimated to have
grown by 14 per cent year-on-year and its industrial production by 25 per
cent (admittedly, rates which are near to overheating). For decades most
developing countries have been growing faster than the OECD members. But now
the developed world is slowing down while many of the newly industrialising
countries appear to be accelerating, largely because of the spread of free
markets and the transfer of technology. In fact the inability of the US and
Western Europe to cope with the new low-cost competition explains, at least
in part, the sluggishness of their economies and the deflationary phase
which they are experiencing, as their labour forces are priced out of many
sectors which are open to international competition.
There is plenty here for emerging market bulls to get their teeth into. The
right investment strategy in these conditions, they say, is to buy bonds in
the developed countries and equities in the emerging markets. The bonds will
yield a profit from the unexpected collapse in Western inflation rates (and
therefore in interest rates) while the Third World equity portfolios will be
plugged into the exhilarating 6 per cent a year growth curves in south-east
Asia and Latin America.
It certainly looked a good story this week as the US Treasury bond bull
market was further extended, whereas Western stock markets faltered.
However, a week is a short time in terms of a global strategy. You have to
make several brave additional assumptions, not the least being that foreign
investors will be permitted to make, and eventually take, a long-term profit
in the fast-growing Third World. It is a lot easier to put the money in than
to transfer it out again.
We have, after all, been here before. Eighty years ago, just ahead of the
outbreak of the First World War, British investors often devoted half their
portfolios to the exciting emerging markets of the time. To the extent that
the capital was invested in North America they did well, but Latin America
was a different story, as was Eastern Europe. Many of today's international
investors, especially those in the US, are calculating that the Latin
American countries are a reformed bunch (although Brazilian inflation at
over 30 per cent a month is as bad as ever).
But the buyers of Latin American bonds learnt an expensive lesson in the
nineteenth century, and the same grim fate befell the naive international
banks in the 1970s. In some cultures, believe it or not, repaying foreign
debts is not regarded as very important. Today's investors in Argentina,
Brazil or Peru are seeking safety in equities rather than bonds, but will
they really fare any better?
History does provide some positive messages. First the US, and then Japan
several generations later, achieved the transition from an emerging economy
to the status of a large, wealthy and stable nation with a secure framework
of law and financial market regulation. Candidates for a similar transition
include China, Russia, India, Brazil and Indonesia.
If you were the manager of a pension fund with a time horizon for your
pension liabilities of 40 years or more you would want to take into account
the possibility that one of these, like Japan, might grow within such a
period to represent a quarter or more of the global stock market. Such
reasoning lies behind decisions such as that of the Dutch bakery industry
pension fund, which sounds a highly cautious institution to me, to invest
possibly over Dollars 50m in Asian equities. The potential returns are
certainly much higher than they are in dull old Europe. But whether retired
Dutch bakers will benefit in the 21st century is another matter.
Certainly I would choose Asia rather than Latin America. But the ride could
prove rather exciting. Emerging markets should be looked on to provide the
cream rather than the basic crust.

FT  11 SEP 93 / English arrogance, French paranoia: Is it still a case of
plus ca change over Anglo-French monetary relations?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are not the words of some disaffected City economist discussing the
recent fiasco in the European exchange rate mechanism. The reference is to
the instability of the franc in the 1920s and the words were written by JM
Keynes, the economist, in his preface to the French translation of A Tract
on Monetary Reform.
With their neat encapsulation of English arrogance and French paranoia, they
serve as a reminder that mutual incomprehension in Anglo-French monetary
relations is close to being one of the eternal verities. Indeed, a striking
feature of the ERM debacle is just how often the same arguments and the same
drama have been played out over the centuries with remarkably similar
results.
Consider, first, the French attitude to speculation, starting with the
arrival in France in the early 18th century of the notorious Scots
financier, John Law. Law was a proto-Keynesian who believed that monetary
expansion and the setting up of more banks held the answer to unemployment.
Exiled from England for killing a man in a duel, he was thrown out of France
in 1706 for asserting that paper money was superior to gold and silver - an
early instance of the strong currency obsession being taken to extremes.
When he returned in 1713 his proposal for setting up a bank to restore order
to the public finances allegedly fell foul of the dying Louis XIV, who is
said to have inquired whether the proposer was a Roman Catholic. The news
that Law was a protestant prompted a magisterial non.
Apocryphal or otherwise, the rejection was temporary. Under the regency that
followed, Law's persistence was rewarded at a time when Desmaretz, the
controller general, was pursuing a savagely deflationary policy through
currency appreciation. Law proceeded to flood the country with paper money,
prompting a spectacular bout of inflation; and there was rampant speculation
as the Scotsman's bank immersed itself in the Mississippi Bubble - a stock
trading scam based on the same chain-letter principle that operated in
England's contemporaneous South Sea Bubble.
The economist and historian Charles Kindleberger has argued that the
collapse of the Mississippi Bubble in 1720 helped set back the cause of
banking and bank notes in France for more than a century. If most French
banking institutions are called caisse, credit, societe or comptoir rather
than banque, it is because Law gave the word bank a bad name - a classic
case, says Kindleberger, of collective financial memory.
In contrast, the English experience with the South Sea Bubble was, in the
end, salutary. The South Sea Company, and the closely associated Sword Blade
Bank, had originally tried to usurp the Bank of England's position as the
main manager of the government's debt. When the bubble collapsed, the Bank
of England rescued the South Sea Company, but let the Sword Blade Bank go to
the wall. Its position was thenceforth unchallenged in British banking and
the orderly management of the public finances was enhanced rather than
weakened.
Yet the French public finances, comprehensively wrecked by the military
adventures and domestic extravagance of Louis XIV, remained rocky throughout
the 18th century; and the attempt to restore them through swingeing taxes
contributed to the pressures that brought about the revolution of 1789.
When the peculiarly unpleasant system of privatised tax collection known as
tax farming then collapsed, France was once again forced into experimenting
with a form of paper money known as assignats - IOUs supposedly secured on
church property appropriated by the state.
The inflationary experiment was extended when the revolutionary government
had to finance unsuccessful military ventures in Belgium and the Rhineland,
as well as action at home against the counter-revolutionary forces in the
Vendee. As the face value of the assignats collapsed, peasants refused to
sell grain for depreciating paper.
Hungry Parisians demanded the guillotine for speculators and called for the
revolutionary government to abandon its commitment to a free internal
market. An economically progressive French Constituent Assembly that had
abolished internal customs barriers in 1790 promptly assumed a more
paternalistic, dirigiste role and reintroduced food price regulation.
Against that background the deep-seated French fear of the speculator is
understandable. And it was a yearning for currency stability that
subsequently caused the French in the 1860s to engage in an early practice
run for the Maastricht treaty: the Latin Monetary Union. This union, which
started with a meeting between France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland in
1865, was inspired by what is now known as the 'optimum currency area'
theory. Its underlying assumption is that when countries have achieved a
degree of convergence in economic structure it makes sense to dispense with
exchange rate changes and reap the efficiency benefits of a single currency.
The problem that haunted the Latin Monetary Union from the outset was that
the French insisted on basing the currency on a bi-metallic standard. No
need here to go into the arcane 19th century debates on bi-metallism. The
essential point is that the attempt to peg the value of a currency to two
metals simultaneously flies in the face of market logic. If the supply of
one metal increases or declines relative to the other, speculators
immediately engage in arbitrage against the countries that try to maintain a
fixed relationship between the gold and silver coinage.
As Morris Perlman, of the London School of Economics, underlines in a recent
paper for the LSE Financial Markets Group, the French political commitment
to bi-metallism overrode the desire of the other participants and of most
contemporary economists for a gold standard.
At the conference of 1865 this fundamental disagreement was swept under the
carpet in favour of procedural discussions. Yet by 1867 the French were
trying to turn this concept into a worldwide currency union, an idea that
was debated at length at a conference of 20 nations, including Britain and
the US, in Paris that year.
All the participants were enthusiastic, with the single exception of - yes -
Britain, its delegates expressing profound scepticism about a proposal based
on the use of the French franc and the decimal system. A British royal
commission subsequently rejected the Paris plan and recommended a universal
currency based on the British sovereign. And Walter Bagehot, the great
editor of The Economist, hankered after an Anglo-Saxon monetary union,
perfectly foreshadowing the instincts of Margaret Thatcher and today's
Eurosceptics. Plus ca change, plus c'est la memsahib.
In the end the universal currency went nowhere. And a sustained fall in the
price of silver relative to gold caused arbitrageurs to dump silver on the
countries in the Latin Monetary Union. The union was thus undermined. And in
1871, after their victory in the Franco-Prussian war, the Germans
administered the coup de grace to hopes of a wider European monetary union
by adopting a gold standard on a basis that was incompatible with the French
system. Worse, they sold silver, an act of sabotage that in French eyes
might bear comparison with the recent actions of the Bundesbank within the
ERM.
Perlman shows how the political strands of the current European monetary
debate are, so to speak, vieux jeux, even if we no longer have technical
discussions about mint ratios for the coinage. Yet it would be wrong to
assume that the obsession with strong currency and the antipathy for market
processes is a uniquely French attribute.
In the 17th century, when the English were far from being pre-eminent in
European finance, City merchants nursed xenophobic worries about Italian
bankers, who were suspected of wanting to drain the country's bullion - a
classic fear on which the doctrine of mercantilism is built.
Nor were the English of this period all instinctive free marketeers where
currencies were concerned. The prominent 17th century economist Gerald
Malynes, a bullionist, inveighed against self-seeking speculators who
distorted currency markets through their use of sophisticated bills of
exchange. Such speculation, he believed, drove parities away from sound
levels that reflected the underlying bullion content of the currency. A
government official, as well as a successful merchant, he wanted all
exchange transactions to be conducted at a fixed rate by a 'royal exchanger'
authorised by the king. Mr Balladur would have felt entirely at ease with
him.
Yet there is a difference between the two countries which partly reflects
the way the market-versus-mercantilism debate took place mainly at national
rather than international level, and had varying outcomes at different
times. One example, the French physiocrats who believed that all wealth
derived ultimately from the land, attacked the industrial interventionism
pioneered by Louis XIV's finance minister Colbert.
It was they who coined the phrase laisser faire. But the more liberal
aspects of their theory failed to take deeper root in France, not least
because the physiocrats underestimated the productive capacity of industry.
But the more important difference probably lies in the respective political
structures. Interventionism sits easily with strong government; and in the
words of the historian Richard Cobb: 'French history has been dominated by
the violence of government . . .' In contrast, the English inheritance from
the Glorious Revolution was not only a parliamentary system that
incorporated a fair number of checks and balances; the interests of private
creditors tended to be given predominance over those of the government
debtor, at least until the 20th century. Discipline was reinforced for much
of that time by adherence to the gold standard.
Power in France, on the other hand, remained tilted in favour of
high-spending governments, and against the interests of creditors, for much
longer. Hence the admiration of 18th and 19th century French historians for
the tidiness of British public finances.
All that changed in the 20th century when public spending throughout the
developed world started its inexorable rise as a percentage of GNP. And the
recent tragedy of Anglo-French monetary relations has been that the swing of
the pendulum in fashion from fixed to floating exchange rates and back again
has rarely coincided in the two countries.
In the 1920s, when the Treasury under Churchill took sterling back to the
pre-war parity against gold, the French were unable to follow suit because
the franc had fallen too low. Between 1924 and 1926 their currency was under
constant speculative attack from German and Austrian banks.
Just as Louis XIV's government banished Law for his soft money views, the
government of Raymond Poincare expelled foreigners who took advantage of the
franc's undervaluation. Yet by the time of the 1929 Crash, when Britain and
Germany were already in depression, the victim of the currency speculators,
France, was enjoying prosperity - derived largely from the undervaluation of
the franc by those same, obnoxious speculators.
In the 1930s, the experience was reversed. When the British came off gold in
1931 France was back in one of its strong currency phases. Indeed, its manic
accumulation of gold had helped precipitate the global liquidity crisis of
1931; and France compounded its problems through dogged adherence to another
precursor of the ERM, the Gold Bloc, the members of which included - shades
of the earlier Latin union - Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
Italy. It took 4 1/2 years of political instability and savage deflation
before France devalued under Leon Blum's Popular Front. Britain, meantime,
was enjoying an extended post-devaluation bout of economic growth.
Yet the French readiness to go along with fixed exchange rates is invariably
coloured by wider perceptions of national interest. In the post-war period
General de Gaulle, an archetypal bullionist, complained vociferously about
the fault lines in the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate agreement, an
essentially Anglo-Saxon creation. His government helped hasten its demise by
selling dollars for gold in an act of monetary aggression that supported de
Gaulle's anti-American foreign policy stance.
Not to be outdone, the British were soon to moan about the fault lines in
the Franco-German inspired ERM, which even the French obsession with
currency stability has not been able to save. Its de facto disintegration
now threatens another idealistic attempt at a European monetary union. Yet
by loosening the ERM bonds, speculation may yet prove to have saved
continental Europe from another savage deflation.
The monetary disagreements between Britain and France, which reflect very
different experiences of inflation both in the 20th century and before, are
thus more subtle than they appear at first sight. How, then, are we to
explain the present French reluctance to take advantage of the new freedom
to cut interest rates after the ERM fiasco; the apparent preference for the
the hair-shirt of the mid-1930s to the prosperity of the late 1920s?
Perhaps the best rationalisation is provided by the late Fred Hirsch. In his
book Money International he remarked of France's deflationary enthusiasm in
the Depression: 'France was genuine in its financial conservatism. Its very
lapses in periods of inflation and external depreciation made it the more
determined to make amends when it could - to store up, so to say, a pile of
financial virtue as a reserve, both physical and spiritual, against the next
fall from monetary grace.'
That, surely, hits the bull's eye - and with much less arrogance than
Keynes.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Trials show water meters may cut consumption by up to 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLD meters could cut water use by some 11 per cent in England and
Wales, according to a long-awaited report by the government and the water
industry, to be published on Monday.
The findings, based on three years of trials, will fuel the growing debate
about whether people who use a lot of water should pay more. Most households
pay a flat annual fee based on property value under the old rating system.
Many businesses have been metered for years.
The results of the 12 regional trials will be welcomed by Ofwat and the
National Rivers Authority, the industry regulators. They have feared that
recurrent water shortages in the south of England would force companies to
build new reservoirs and raise customers' bills.
The industry's response is likely to be mixed. Anglian Water and Cambridge
Water have already announced compulsory metering to curb water use. But many
water companies, including some in the south, were sceptical that metering
would be worth the high cost - industry estimates suggest Pounds 3bn for
England and Wales. 'Metering might delay the need for new reservoirs, but
not forever,' one said.
The report says to install a meter typically cost Pounds 165 inside a home
and Pounds 200 outside. The cost of fitting free meters in the smaller 11
trials ran to several million pounds, split between the environment
department and water companies.
In the Isle of Wight, the 50,000 households surveyed reduced their water use
by some 21 per cent after meters were installed. But in the Hotwells
district of Bristol Water, where some 850 households were tested, the drop
was only some 2 per cent.
Many water executives yesterday questioned whether these falls in demand
would be permanent. One said: 'The Isle of Wight trial took place over only
three years, during recession and during the worst drought for decades - it
is hard to separate the metering effects from other exhortations to use less
water.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Government stands firm on public sector pay restraints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ministers yesterday met the vigorous protest over the decision to
maintain tough controls on UK public sector pay with a blunt warning that
the government would press ahead.
Public sector union leaders said the government would face serious conflict
if it sought to maintain a second 12-month period of pay restraint among 5m
public sector workers after the current 1.5 per cent wage limit ends in
November.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the government would stick by
the policies needed to bring about economic recovery, even if these were
unpopular.
Speaking in Scotland, Mr Major said: 'People are concerned at controversial
decisions. But sometimes it is necessary to take controversial decisions
even though they may be unpopular.'
The bitter unpopularity among Conservative supporters of the Budget decision
to impose value added tax on domestic fuel was revealed in the motions put
forward for the annual party conference published yesterday .
Ministers have already said that the policy will not be reversed. Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday brushed aside the threat of public sector
strikes and said the time for annual automatic pay increases had gone.
'We have got to get used to a climate in which Britain is now in control of
inflation,' he told BBC radio. 'We do not now have this annual performance
whereby significant well-organised groups think every year that pay has got
to go up to give a real increase in their living standards.'
Firefighters are likely to hold a ballot next month over industrial action
in defence of the 15-year-old formula that links their pay to the upper
quartile of male full-time workers' earnings.
Mr Ken Cameron, the Fire Brigade Union's general secretary, said a second
year of wage restraint would 'increase the likelihood of (firefighters)
voting 'yes' in a ballot for strike action'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said it was an attempt to make
public servants 'pay the price for the government's economic mistakes'.

The orchestrated drive in the bullion price above Dollars 400 an ounce
neatly extricated Sir James Goldsmith from most of his illiquid stake in
Newmont Mining. Whether anyone else made much money is a more open question.
Worries about an upturn in US inflation in the spring, buying in the Far
East and talk of a shortage in the market as fabrication demand exceeds
mined supply were enough to persuade many investors to suspend their
disbelief. The constant search for the latest fad by US hedge funds was
simply the cherry on the cake of the speculative run.
Presumably that factor is now working hard in reverse as such loose holders
dump the metal. The suspicion also remains that central banks, that other
great negative factor overhanding the market, may have been selling.
France's shortage of foreign exchange as a result of the ERM debacle has
made it the favourite suspect. This is all the more so since the Bank of
France holds an unusually high proportion of its reserves in bullion. The
French government has denied that it is liquidating holdings, but the threat
of sales looms.
Against that, there are still some plus points. With interest rates low the
opportunity cost of holding bullion is reduced. Value buyers may also emerge
now that the price has fallen back. There is still the steady tightening in
the market as fabrication exceeds production. And while inflation is hardly
a threat in industrialised countries, gold may yet provide a useful hedge
for Chinese holders. The easy profits made by Sir James are, however,
yesterday's game.

FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Signet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who have inflated Signet's share price must be gambling that the
ugly duckling will eventually turn into a swan. Yet those who remember the
company in its previous incarnation as Ratners may have their doubts. On any
sensible criteria the shares have little value. There are no dividends or
earnings to support a yield or a price earnings ratio, and preference share
dividends are piling up unpaid.
Given that some kind of capital restructuring lurks on the horizon, those
who have been buying the shares look over-optimistic. The first half may not
be a good guide to the year since the business is quintessentially seasonal,
but the reduction of losses and cash flow is still painfully slow. Much of
the cost-cutting which can be managed has already been done, and only a
marked improvement in sales will restore profits. With jewellery purchases
highly discretionary, that is as much dependent on the recovery in the
economy as on management action or marketing flair.
In that light the recent award of generous share options ought to raise a
few eyebrows. Signet's managers are already well paid for the size of their
business, and turning the operation round is largely a matter of common
sense and hanging on. Even so, unless the scheme is adjusted to take account
of any dilution on restructuring, it is hard to see managers benefiting.
Perhaps the hope is that, if the share price rises enough, a rights issue
will pay the rolled up preference dividends without diluting ordinary
shareholders out of existence.

FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While most drugs stocks have been enjoying a minor recovery SmithKline
Beecham is suffering a run of bad luck. The threat to its membership of the
FT-SE 100 index is bad for sentiment, although there is scant evidence that
the exclusion of a company from any index has much bearing on the
performance of the shares. The US Food and Drug Administration's reluctance
to approve a weak form of Tagamet, SB's biggest selling drug, for sale as an
over-the-counter medicine is more serious.
Time lost establishing a presence in the US consumer market carries a cost.
Tagamet's US patent expires at the end of next year, so generic competition
is already looming. Since marketing costs eat into profits in the early
years of an OTC product, the delay makes it less likely that consumer
earnings will fill the gap as prescription sales are eroded. The FDA has
questioned Tagamet's efficacy as a heartburn remedy rather than its safety,
so SB may yet win a swift and favourable decision. But that cannot be taken
for granted. The FDA ruled against nicotine patches earlier this year
because it could find no conclusive proof of their benefits.
Still, the rigour of the US regulator will not alter the trend towards OTC
medicines. Asking patients to pay for non-essential medicines dovetails with
other efforts to contain government spending on healthcare. While profits on
prescription drugs are being squeezed, margins of around 15 to 20 per cent
on mature OTC products can no longer be ignored.

FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Counting on results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On one level the recent weakness of UK equities looks like a straightforward
correction after the rise during August, a pattern repeated in New York,
Paris and Frankfurt. All the more so since the weakest sectors - such as
food retailing and food manufacturing - are precisely those which showed the
strongest gains on the upswing. Whether the correction develops into a more
sustained period of doubt turns crucially on corporate earnings living up to
expectations. So far the evidence has been mixed.
Interim figures from cyclical bellwethers such as BTR must be counted as
disappointing. Yet companies ranging from Cadbury Schweppes to Blue Circle
turned in creditable results, albeit accompanied by a rights issue in the
case of the former. Equally importantly for a market transfixed by yield,
surprisingly generous dividend increases from Glaxo and Prudential suggest
the outlook for dividend growth may be brighter than hitherto expected in
some sectors.
In the case of pharmaceuticals and life assurance, additional yield might be
seen as compensation for an increasingly uncertain trading outlook. In other
sectors, the flurry of companies offering enhanced scrip dividends -
effectively small rights issues in place of cash dividends - is a reminder
that companies have overpaid during recession. While inflation is weak and
bond yields are falling these concerns are unlikely to matter much. Where
the market will find inspiration for another great leap forward is less
clear.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Germany wants eastern Europe in Nato and EC
</HEADLINE>

GERMANY yesterday added its backing to a push for the integration of eastern
Europe with western institutions, including Nato, the European Community,
and the Western European Union.
In a restatement of German foreign policy, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign
minister, spelt out a series of ways in which he would seek to promote
enlargement both of Nato and the EC to include the central European
democracies, without alienating Russia and Ukraine.
In Brussels, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, also supported the
goal of future membership of the alliance for the countries of central and
eastern Europe.
He told the annual conference of the International Institute of Strategic
Studies in Brussels that an enlarged Nato would increase the stability of
the whole of Europe and be in the interest of all nations, including Russia
and Ukraine'.
Mr Kinkel pledged his government's firm support for the creation of a
European Union - including European monetary union and a common foreign and
security policy.
His plans included joint peacekeeping and peacemaking operations by the
western and eastern members of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council -
which includes Nato and the former eastern bloc states.
He proposed that the WEU, the intended arm of EC defence co-operation,
should offer association status to all candidates for membership of the
community, including central and east European countries. And he said that
Nato should declare its willingness to make bilateral agreements on security
co-operation with all countries seeking membership of the future integrated
EC.
Mr Kinkel's plans for eastern Europe, announced to a foreign policy congress
of his Free Democratic party in Bonn, are the most specific and radical to
have been put forward by a leading member of the Nato alliance. They may
well be seen as over-hasty by other allies but they reflect concern in top
German circles over the need to integrate eastern and western Europe, to
counter political, economic and social instability.
Mr Worner's statement is the clearest signal to date that Nato is prepared
to accept Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary, Slovakia and other central
European states provided they meet standards on human rights, democracy and
the protection of ethnic minorities.

FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation data, bonds
support stocks

Wall Street
GOOD inflation news and a rally in bond prices helped stock markets to end a
difficult week on a firmly positive note yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.14 at 3,621.63. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 4.22 higher at 461.72, while
the Amex composite finished up 2.68 at 456.06, and the Nasdaq composite up
6.59 at 744.30. Trading volume on the NYSE was 266m shares.
After three difficult trading days, when share prices either fell sharply or
struggled to hold their ground, the announcement of a big fall in producer
price inflation was welcome news for equity investors.
The government said that the August producer prices index fell 0.6 per cent,
and that 'core' producer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy
components), fell by 1.0 per cent - the largest decline ever recorded.
Although a good part of the decline was attributed to sharp falls in tobacco
prices, the inflation data was still regarded as extremely positive for both
stocks and bonds.
The impression of low inflation was reinforced by a drop in commodity prices
yesterday - the Commodity Research Board's index of prices ended down almost
two points at 213.17. Lower inflation and commodity prices provided a big
lift to bonds, with the benchmark 30-year government issue climbing more
than a point and the yield dropping to 5.87 per cent.
Among individual stocks, Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 4 1/4 to
Dollars 61 1/8 in heavy trading on reports that the entertainment group has
been discussing a merger with Viacom, owner of MTV and other television and
cinema interests.
According to the reports, the two companies would swap stock in a deal that
would value Paramount shares at Dollars 60 each. Separately, Paramount
unveiled a modest improvement in second quarter earnings to Dollars 120.4m.
Viacom, traded on the American Stock Exchange, firmed Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 65 3/4 .
Blockbuster rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 after the company told
analysts at a retail investment conference in New York that it was
comfortable with estimates of between 29 cents and 31 cents a share for the
third quarter.
Bank stocks were once again in demand as analysts forecast good third
quarter results. JP Morgan rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 79, Chase Manhattan
rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 , Citicorp added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars
35 3/4 , and Banc One climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were flat-to-firmer.
Microsoft rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 78 and Intel Dollars  3/4 at Dollars
65 1/2.

FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Canada): Turbulent week in Toronto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORONTO stock exchange proved this week that investors in resource-based
markets need iron-clad stomachs, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The TSE-300 index lurched from a 172-point dive in the first two trading
days of the week to a 56-point climb on Thursday. It then fell 7.63 points,
or 0.19 per cent, to close at 4001.69 on Friday.
The turbulence came just two weeks after the index broke through its August
1987 record, reaching a new all-time high of 4,143 on Sept 1. This week's
whipsaw action was most evident in the gold and junior oil and gas sectors,
which were the mainsprings of the 24 per cent rise in the TSE-300 in the
first eight months of 1993. But the market as a whole has been ripe for a
retreat.
With the TSE-300 at an average of about 17 times projected earnings, prices
have been supported by little more than hopes of improved corporate profits
and dividends. The economy shows little signs of life, however.
The plunge in the gold price and weakness in metals and forest-products
markets has clouded the outlook for big resource companies.
Mr Christopher Martin, a director at Cassels Blaikie, a Toronto securities
firm, cautions that 'there's still definite over-valuation in the
market-place. You have to be very selective.' He notes that, besides weak
commodities markets, many of the traditional giants of commerce and industry
are still in the midst of restructurings.
On the other hand, many money managers continue to insist that they will use
any substantial correction as a buying opportunity.
While further shocks may be in store, it's difficult to find an analyst who
thinks this week's upheavals are the end of the bull market.
Interest rates and inflation remain low; and the economy is recovering, more
slowly than most expected, but it is recovering.

SHARE prices remained little changed as selling, which followed the fixing
of the settlement price for September futures and options contracts, was
countered by index-linked buying and purchases by individual and financial
investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 7.60 to 20,817.98, down 1.4 per cent on the week.
The release of the Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly report on business
sentiment, had little impact on investor sentiment.
The index reached a high of 20,846.58 in the morning session, and lost
ground on profit-taking, hitting the day's low of 20,686.47 in the
afternoon. The index recouped some losses on arbitrage related buying.
Volume rose to 570m shares against 247m, due to trading linked to futures
and options settlement. Advances led declines by 544 to 461, with 160 issues
remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 1.16
to 1,677.50, its first rise in five market days. In London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index closed at 1283.60, up 0.67.
Steel companies continued to lose ground. Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, fell Y9 to Y333. Other leading steel makers, which announced
interim losses for the current fiscal year, also lost ground. Kawasaki Steel
fell Y11 to Y329.
Brokers were weak following reports by the Nikkei Shimbun, a business daily,
that Sanyo Securities had sought financial aid from banks and other
creditors due to mounting losses at a finance affiliate. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange suspended trading in Sanyo, but the broker and ministry of finance
officials later denied the allegations.
Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y2,160 and Daiwa Securities lost Y20 to
Y1,440.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y922,000, turning higher for
the first time in seven days. Railway stocks were higher on the last day of
subscriptions for the offering of 1.4m East Japan Railway shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 31.95 to 22,780.99 in volume of 29.2m shares.
The index rose for the first time in four trading days on hopes of an
imminent cut in the official discount rate. Nintendo, the video game maker,
fell Y190 to Y9,740 on profit taking.
Roundup
FOREIGN demand helped some Pacific Rim markets higher.
MANILA remained in record territory, helped by heavy foreign buying of
Manila Electric. The composite index added 7.45 to 1,919.22, for a 2.2 per
cent rise on the week.
Manila Electric A shares rose 4 pesos to 206 pesos.
TAIWAN ended higher on hopes for lower interest rates and the weighted index
rose 31.74 to 3,873.06, 1.5 per cent higher on the week.
AUSTRALIA was firmer in moderate trade, taking its lead from a recovery in
gold stocks and strength in some blue chips.
The All Ordinaries index rose 10.1 to at 1941.5, for a 0.6 per cent decline
over the week.
News Corp soared 32 cents to ADollars 10.72 as investors re-rated the stock
following this week's news that the BSkyB satellite TV arm would begin
payouts to shareholders next year.
Lend Lease also surged 32 cents to ADollars 17.04 after Thursday's
announcement that it was buying Yarmouth Group Inc of the US.
BOMBAY closed higher on buying by state-owned financial institutions and by
foreign fund managers, and the BSE 30-share index rose 42.35 to 2705.07, for
a weekly gain of 1.5 per cent.
HONG KONG saw some late overseas demand help to erase early losses and the
Hang Seng index edged up 6.69 to 7,593.45, 1 per cent higher on the week.
SINGAPORE was hit by profit-taking in blue chip issues which left the
Straits Times industrial index 21.94 lower at 1,998.79, for a 2.1 per cent
decline over the week.

FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi charts a curious
course in Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAKER dollar affected some of the continent's bourses yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN took the government approval of the 1994 budget in its stride, and
shares finished marginally ahead as the market wound down ahead of next
Wednesday's close of the September account. The Comit index rose 4.87 to
597.51, for a 5 per cent decline on the week.
Ferruzzi continued to chart a curious course, the share opening 10 per cent
higher before the price turned turtle later in the morning and finished
L49.75 or 10 per cent lower on the day at L448. Volume was a very heavy
40.7m shares.
Dealers were at a loss to explain the turnaround: on each of the first four
days of the week, the shares rose by their maximum permissible 10 per cent
limit.
One dealer suggested that the exchange authorities could not delay much
longer an inquiry into the stock's recent volatility.
Telecommunications shares made a firm start in the wake of government
approval of the sector's reorganisation next year. But gains were
subsequently trimmed to leave Sip L11 higher at L3,311 and Italcable L52
ahead at L9,281.
FRANKFURT eased further, its sixth consecutive decline, as the market
continued to be affected by the weaker dollar. The DAX index ended down
19.37 or 1 per cent at 1,861.44, a fall on the week of 3.3 per cent.
While there was disappointment at the limited cut in the the repo on
Thursday, some analysts remained confident that after a period of
consolidation the market would again move ahead.
Viag and Linde featured among the day's heaviest losers, with respective
falls of DM15 and DM11 to DM436 and DM770. Among the car makers, much in the
news this week, BMW lost DM6 to DM553 and Volkswagen DM6.30 to DM354.50
while Daimler was off DM8.50 at DM710. Schering was the only bright spot,
rising DM5.50 to DM962.50.
PARIS was little changed on the day but down 2.2 per cent on the week. The
CAC-40 index lost 0.37 to 2,108.38 after a high of 2,117 and a low of 2,094.
Turnover dropped back to FFr3.1bn from FFr4.6bn.
Carrefour, which had attracted some interest earlier in the week, lost FFr11
to FFr3,173. Hoare Govett commented that the shares look fully valued and
recommended a holding only to maintain a sector weighting.
Bouygues, which announced the award of a new contract on Wednesday, added
FFr7 to FFr674.
ZURICH edged lower in thin trading ahead of a long holiday weekend. The SMI
index shed 18.5 to 2,363.6, down 3.1 per cent on the week.
Nestle led the market lower on further consideration of Thursday's first
half results, the registered shares shedding SFr17 to SFr1,053.
ATHENS rebounded after a 2.6 per cent drop at the opening, as institutional
investors were attracted back by lower prices. The general index finished
4.37 higher at 806.22 having dropped below 780 points at midday on
pre-election jitters.
ISTANBUL finished at a fourth record high this week, but retreated from
early gains. The composite index ended 110.1 higher at 12,948.9, 11 per cent
higher on the week.

FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo's investors ignore the bad news -
Hopes of lower interest rates have been supporting equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market has a lot to worry about: the floundering economy,
plunging corporate profits and an unstable coalition government. Yet
investors have been hanging on to hopes of lower interest rates and a number
of new issues to spur sentiment.
In spite of the dramatic political changes, as the Liberal Democratic Party
was ousted after its 38 year rule and a new coalition government formed, the
Nikkei average has remained surprisingly stable. In yen terms, the index has
gained 4.4 per cent since the beginning of July.
Share prices have also been resilient against negative corporate news, such
as Daiwa Bank's rescue of Cosmo Securities, following its Y69.8bn loss over
tobashi, or shuffling of clients' accounts to hide unrealised losses.
Mr Alexander Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, says that share
prices are being supported 'purely by interest rates'. The Bank of Japan is
expected to lower the official discount rate next week. Some analysts point
out that share prices have discounted a 50 basis point cut, but a wider cut
could move prices higher.
Meanwhile, the government has started to envisage the possibility of another
fiscal stimulus package, and some cabinet members have called for an income
tax cut.
The increase in new issues has also created activity. The over-the-counter
market has seen a jump in trading due to new listings. More than 60
companies have listed there this year, up from 34 last year, and the OTC
index has risen 7.7 per cent since the start of July. The listing of DDI,
the long distance telecom company, on the second section of the TSE has also
been welcomed.
The listing of East Japan Railway in October may help to lift the
government's ban on new listings on the first section. Mr Yasuo Ueki at
Nikko Securities hopes that the listing of JR East will lure back individual
investors.
However, negative factors which many have chosen to ignore are steadily
worsening. The gloomy outlook on an economic recovery has deepened during
the past few weeks, with a spate of downward earnings revisions by leading
corporations and the announcement of the tankan, or quarterly report on
business sentiment.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone said it would cut 10,000 staff through early
retirement, while it also announced a cut in long distance call rates to
sustain market share. Leading steel companies revised profit estimates
downward for the year, with Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker,
setting up a task force to reduce administrative staff.
Nissan Motor also announced last Thursday that it may sell part of its cross
shareholdings in banks and insurance companies to cover its losses of Y40bn.
The tankan, released yesterday, confirmed fears of a worsening economy, with
business confidence of manufacturers falling to the lowest level in 18 years
and of service industries declining to a record low.
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, revised
downward its profit forecasts of leading companies for the current year to
next March. NRI said pre-tax profits would fall 14.2 per cent, lowering its
earlier projection by 7.2 percentage points.
The government's vague stance on the economy is also a worrying factor.
While it has announced deregulation policies and the need to control
political donations, it has also been slow in addressing the worsening
economy.
Mr Kazuo Aichi, of the Japan Renewal Party, one of the core coalition
parties, says the main objectives of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition is
political and electoral reform, and the cabinet will focus mainly on
achieving those goals.
However, analysts say it may take time for investors to react to bad news.
'As long as the government can maintain the impression that things are
moving forward, people are going to buy stocks,' says Mr Kinmont. He expects
the Nikkei index to reach 22,000 to 23,000 during the last quarter of the
calendar year.
While pessimists have given up waiting for the Nikkei to fall below 20,000,
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, strategist of Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment
Management's second investment division, remains a faithful bear. 'Some
investors haven't realised how bad the economy and corporate profits are,'
he says, warning that the Nikkei average's record low at 14,309 seen last
August, could be broken in the near term.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets in London had a quiet session, trading within narrow
ranges as professional traders took a cautious view of equity markets,
writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the September contract, which
expires at the end of next week, reached both the peak and the low of the
session within two hours of the opening.
At the official close, the September contract was trading at around a
three-point premium to the cash market; fair value on the contract is now at
zero. Trading volume was low at 9,409 contracts.
There was some roll-over into the December position, which held on to most
of its estimated 21-point fair value premium, on 2,406 contracts.
Turnover in traded options fell from Thursday's 41,557 contracts to 22,360,
with the FT-SE contract less active at 6,371 contracts against 10,188. The
Euro FT-SE (3,631 contracts) headed the list of individual options, with BT
(3,040) close behind as investors reacted to the increased competitition in
the mobile phones market.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International news and information organisation Reuters Holdings advanced 24
to 1554p, buoyed by news about its Globex trading system.
The after hours electronic dealing mechanism was developed by Reuters and is
owned by the main Chicago trading exchanges, the CBOT and CME.
It suffered after the London International Financial Futures Exchange said
it would not join forces with the CBOT and CME because of a clash over its
lucrative German government bond future contract. Yesterday, it was
announced that the talks were back on track.
The morning after the night before at Babcock International found investors
slightly more forgiving of Thursday's profits warning and the shares slipped
back just 1 3/4 to 29 3/4 p. Turnover was another huge 29m, demonstrating
good two-way business in the engineering group.
Analysts attending a meeting with the management yesterday said that a
rights issue was a near certainty to mend the balance sheet, with talk of a
Pounds 50m 1-for-3 needed by the year-end.
Electricity and water utility stocks surged as investors bought on yield
considerations. Smith New Court was said to be recommending the water
stocks, although the house refused to comment. All the waters saw hefty
rises, among them Severn Trent up 13 at 556p, South West 15 to 580p and
Yorkshire 16 to 565p. Among the Recs, East Midlands gained 11 to 530p,
Manweb 10 to 592p and Yorkshire 8 to 574p.
Mining company RTZ fell 12 to 713p on a downgrade from a London brokerage
house, adverse press comment and lower copper prices.
Swiss Bank moved to a sell from buy based on a bearish outlook on the dollar
and copper prices. There was also press comment that RTZ would find it
difficult to match its interim 15 per cent profits rise in the second half.
Finally, dealers said copper's early weakness, falling more than Dollars 23
to a low of Dollars 1,877, was another factor. Uncertainty over the outlook
for base metal prices as the global economies struggle to recover from
economic recession has restrained share prices in the sector.
Container leasing group Tiphook jumped 14 to 268p after revealing its first
ever breakdown of container use.
Telecoms groups rebounded after the mauling earlier this week after the
launch of Mercury's new cellular network, One-2-One. Sector analysts were
busy advising clients on the likely developments in the industry following
Mercury's sudden expansion into what is seen as a highly-prized market.
There was also talk that BT was closer to buying the 40 per cent stake in
Cellnet owned by Securicor as a result of Mercury's move, although analysts
said they believed such a development was not imminent. Estimates put
Securicor's stake at around Pounds 1.5bn. BT shares gained 3 to 419 1/2 p,
while Securicor ordinary climbed 8 to 1073p. Buying from across the Atlantic
again helped Vodafone, ahead 4 at 493p.
An unimpressive meeting following the announcement of the results as well as
the disclosure of further losses saw Ratners shares lose 2 to 32 1/2 p. The
company also received approval to change its name to Signet with immediate
effect.
August figures from BAA showed an increase in passengers handled of 4.6 per
cent on the same period last year. The news helped the shares edge forward 2
to 820p. A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson was said to have aided the
rise of Ocean Group, up 2 at 337p.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte rights talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of an imminent rights issue by Forte produced a late flurry of trading,
sending shares in the hotel group down sharply at the close. The rumours
were firmly denied after the market closed by Forte.
Dealers said that a big seller in the market, by touting around different
broking houses for prices, had prompted marketmakers to mark quotations
lower.
However, the rights issue story excited imaginations most, given Forte's
debt situation, with speculation that such a call would be in excess of
Pounds 500m. Forte has said previously that any such move would only be made
to accompany an acquisition. Forte shares closed 5 1/2 off at 237p.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: FDA move knocks SmithKline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE bad news hit SmithKline Beecham shares yesterday when the drugs group
failed to obtain US approval for a mild version of Tagamet, its anti-ulcer
drug.
The Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group had applied to the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to sell a diluted form of the treatment without
prescription as an antidote to heartburn. However, at a meeting late on
Thursday, the FDA came back with a series of questions that had to be dealt
with before approval could be given.
A favourable decision could have added between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m
a year to the company's earnings. It would also have countered the effect of
Tagamet coming off patent in the US next May.
In the event, the decision added to news that SmithKline Units might be
withdrawn from the FT-A Actuaries indices if new rules are imposed by the
Stock Exchange. The shares fell 12 to 417p yesterday with some dealers
talking of switching into Glaxo. Glaxo shares continued strong following
Thursday's surprise dividend hike. There was heavy buying in the US late on
Thursday and further buying in London yesterday which saw the shares rise 12
to 640p.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Modest rally in the blue chip stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAUTIOUS and somewhat faltering rally on the London stock market yesterday
reflected hopes that, following the Bundesbank's action this week, the next
cut in UK interest rates will not be long delayed. A temporary respite from
the flow of company trading results took some of the pressure off the market
as it waited for next week's list of corporate and economic data.
But the recovery was erratic, and the Footsie twice came close to re-testing
its overnight levels before closing 5.8 up at 3,037. Towards the end of the
session, rumours of another sizeable rights issue call revived, with the
hotels group in the frame this time.
The FT-SE Index has fallen by a further 20.3 points this week - the first
leg of the trading account. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, up 7.4 at 3,476.3
yesterday, reduced the week's setback to no more than a few points.
The announcement that Banque Indosuez was closing down the institutional
investor side of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, two long-established names in the
London stock market, confirmed rumours that have circulated for some weeks.
However, the French bank's decision underlined the pressures still felt in
the marketplace despite the return to generally profitable trading volumes
in equities.
Government bonds had a quiet session, although at the close the longer dates
were extending recent gains and small rises in near-dated stocks indicated
hopes of a cut in base rates sooner rather than later. Little attention was
paid to statistics on the UK trade gap for the second quarter of the year.
A further gain in Glaxo shares represented about a half of the overall gain
in the Footsie. But Glaxo was well balanced by weakness elsewhere in drug
stocks as the US dollar weakened. SmithKline Beecham suffered again from
doubts over the UK stock market index rating of the units.
Against this background, there was little optimism to be discerned behind
yesterday's share price rally. SG Warburg referred in its weekly client
briefing to the 'cautious tone' of many of the companies reporting trading
progress, stressing that overseas earnings are a key element.
Seaq volume fell to 596m shares yesterday from 726.8m on the previous day,
with non-Footsie stocks making up around 64 per cent of the total. retail,
or customer business, strengthened to a worth of Pounds 1.56bn on Thursday.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Caution continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in most European cash and futures markets continued to be very
cautious about the prospect for further monetary policy easing in Europe
after the Bundesbank's rate cut on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
Dealers in German markets continued to take the view that the  1/2
percentage point cut in the discount rate was a technical move to restore a
gap between the repo rate and the interest rate floor - and that this may
have been the last policy easing before November.
The near-term Euromark futures contracts continued to fall back, as they did
on Thursday. The December contract was down 5 basis points at 94.03 at the
close.
Conditions in the cash market were not a lot easier than they had been on
Thursday, with call money being quoted in a broad range of seven to 7.25 per
cent. The market continued to be dogged by the low level of bidding in the
weekly repo and the recent low usage of rediscount funds.
In the French market, interest rate futures were a little stronger towards
the end of trading, partly because of the franc's better performance against
the D-Mark in the European afternoon. The December contract was trading at
around 93.99 towards the close, up 4 basis points on the day.
The Belgian franc futures market continued to look as though it belonged to
a different epoch of trading. The September contract rose 105 basis points,
to close at around 90.50, indicating expectations of sharp cuts in rates.
This followed Belgium's cut in its important central rate by  1/4 of a
percentage point, to 10.25 per cent, on Thursday.
The cut in Belgian official rates has been accompanied by a dramatic fall in
3 month money this week from about 13 per cent on Monday to around 9 1/2 per
cent yesterday. But the Belgian authorities are clearly not prepared to
decouple interest rate policy from the Bundesbank.
Sterling interest rate futures were given a slight lift from the latest
trade figures, which showed a slight narrowing in the deficit. The December
contract rose 3 basis points to close at 94.39.
Conditions in the cash market were soft after the easy removal of a Pounds
700m shortage. Three month money again closed at around 5 7/8 per cent, but
with a slightly narrower spread.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up sharply on yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR appreciated sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday, amid
increasing signs that the authorities in Tokyo were looking at ways to
reduce their trade surplus with the US, writes James Blitz.
In European trading, the dollar opened very strongly at around Y105.60 and
pierced the Y106 level in early trade. It failed to break through the
Y106.65 level, which is seen by many traders as a key chart point. It later
closed at Y106.25.
In recent weeks, there have been increasing signs that the Japanese
authorities are seeking another substantial fiscal stimulus to their economy
later this year, a move which would allay US pressure to push up the yen as
a means of reducing the trade surplus.
The Bank of Japan's tankan report also showed weakness in the domestic
economy, reinforced expectations of such a fiscal boost. It also led to
renewed speculation of another cut in Japan's official discount rate, which
is currently at 2.5 per cent.
Another factor pushing the dollar higher may have been reports that the
Japanese foreign minister had said that Tokyo could set targets for the
reduction of the trade surplus.
This was seen as another example of how accommodating the Japanese are
proving to be on the trade issue. 'There has never been any suggestion thus
far from Japan about targets,' said Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase
Manhattan bank in London. 'There could be a lot of pressure on the yen next
week.'
Against the D-Mark, the dollar continued to look weak, hindered by producer
prices figures which showed a 0.6 percentage point fall in August, compared
to forecasts of a 0.2 percentage point rise.
The very low level of inflation has added to the view that there is little
upward presure on US interest rates. The dollar was more or less unchanged
at DM1.5980.
In the European exchange rate mechanism, most currencies performed a little
more strongly against the D-Mark. On Thursday, the French franc and Belgian
franc had been unchanged after the Europe-wide cuts in interest rates.
Yesterday, dealers appeared to be taking the view that the monetary easing
had been rather more modest than anticipated, giving them a reason to buy
the currencies.
The French franc closed at FFr3.511 from FFr3.525 while the Belgian franc
closed at BFr21.47 from BFr21.75.
Sterling closed at DM2.4750 from a previous DM2.4775. This was in spite of
trade figures which showed that, in the three months to June, the UK
imported Pounds 3.3bn more than it exported, a slightly narrower deficit
than in the previous quarter.

FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Publishing operations lift
earnings at Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Commun-ications, the US media group rumoured to be considering a
merger with Viacom Communications, has posted first-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 120.4m, or Dollars 1.01 a share.
A year earlier, the publishing, entertainment and theme parks group earned
Dollars 114.3m or 96 cents. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.35bn from Dollars
1.06bn. The gain was led by near-record operating income from Paramount's
publishing side and from sharply higher returns from its entertainment
business.
On Wall Street, shares in Paramount rose Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars
61 1/8 . The stock gained Dollars 1 7/8 on Thursday amid speculation that
Paramount was discussing a stock-swap with Viacom which would value
Paramount at about Dollars 60 a share. The companies would not comment on
the rumours, but it is believed that Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman
and chief executive has had informal discussions with Viacom's chairman Mr
Sumner Redstone, for several years.
Paramount has been looking for a merger partner since 1989, when its Dollars
200-a-share bid for Time failed.
A merger between Paramount and Viacom would create a company with extensive
cable and broadcast operationsas well as film and publishing businesses.
Paramount, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 4.27bn, owns a leading film studio
and television production company, as well as the Simon &amp; Schuster book
publishing house and New York's Madison Square Garden sports arena.
Viacom, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 1.86bn, is one of the most powerful
players in cable television. Its networks include MTV, Nickelodeon and
Showtime. Viacom is expanding overseas. MTV has recently entered Japanese
and Latin American markets, and has a growing presence in Europe. The
company also has an impressive television library of classic American TV
shows.
Paramount's entertainment division posted first-quarter operating income of
Dollars 89m, up from Dollars 60.8m. Results benefited from box-office
successes such as The Firm and Indecent Proposal. Paramount said its
entertainment results also benefited from higher operating income from its
theme parks.
Analysts at Salomon Brothers noted that half of the revenue gain and about
75 per cent of the operating profit rise came from Paramount's four domestic
and one international theme parks, acquired late last year.
But Madison Square Garden deepened its seasonal loss. The publishing
division posted record revenues for the quarter, led by strong gains from
its educational books.
Operating income from television programming fell in the quarter. Although
syndication sales of popular shows such as Cheers and Star Trek: the Next
Generation advanced, results at Paramount's jointly-owned cable operation,
USA Networks declined.

CBR GROUP, the Belgian cement manufacturer, announced a 13.4 per cent drop
in net consolidated profit for the first six months of 1993, from BFr1.45bn
to BFr1.26bn (Dollars 36m), and warned that its net results for 1993 could
be 'slightly below' those of 1992, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Restructuring of its North American activities had led to extraordinary
charges of BFr252m, compared with BFr19m last time.

FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Scoop puts Unilever on US map -
Frank McGurty on Kraft's sale of its entire frozen dessert business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICE CREAM is one of life's simple pleasures, but keeping pace with the
fickle tastes of ice cream fanciers has become a complex challenge for the
world's big consumer products groups.
For Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group and Europe's biggest ice cream producer,
the product accounts for an estimated 30 per cent of its food profits. But
for Kraft General Foods, America's largest producer, ice cream has been a
source of repeated frustration. Growth has been lacklustre, its margins soft
and the market share of its key brands - Breyers and Sealtest - has eroded.
This week Kraft, part of the Philip Morris tobacco and food group, decided
that it had had enough. It announced that Unilever had agreed to buy its
entire US frozen dessert business, with annual sales of about Dollars 500m.
Added to Unilever's existing US turnover of about Dollars 200m, the
acquisition vaults the Anglo-Dutch group to the top of the US league table,
with almost a fifth of a market worth about Dollars 3bn annually. Terms of
the transaction were not disclosed but analysts say the price was about
Dollars 300m.
For Unilever, the move represents another step in a strategy of diversifying
its product range in the US, and follows its purchase of several smaller US
ice cream concerns. The acquisition 'puts Unilever on the map' in the US,
says Mr Jack Salzman, who follows the food industry for Goldman Sachs, the
New York securities house.
Indeed, the size of the Kraft business and the strong name recognition of
the Kraft brands offer Unilever an opportunity to build on its strengths,
and perhaps to replicate its success in the Dollars 4bn European market,
where it commands a 40 per cent share.
Until now, Unilever has focused on the so-called 'novelty' segment, with ice
cream bars and other confections made for immediate consumption. The Kraft
business, which packages most of its products in large containers and sells
them through supermarkets, introduces Unilever into the US bulk ice cream
sector, the biggest part of the market. At the same time, however, Unilever
inherits many of the problems faced by Kraft.
Overall, sales of bulk ice creams are growing at a sluggish 2 per cent rate,
according to Nielsen Market Research. Breyers and Sealtest are faring even
worse, with the brands' combined sales contracting in the year to June 15.
The duo still commands more than 15 per cent of supermarket sales; and
Breyers is still number one, but its share and the size of its lead have
been shrinking.
The challenge has come at both the high and low ends. On one hand, consumers
have shown more willingness to seek out bargains, as they have in many
grocery categories. Generic or 'private label' ice creams now account for
more than 28 per cent of supermarket sales. Growth has largely come at the
expense of the national brands such as Seal-test on the lower end of the
branded spectrum.
In response to strong price competition, Kraft was forced virtually to 'give
the product away', according to Mr Howard Waxman, editor of the Ice Cream
Reporter, an industry newsletter. Operating margins were hovering at about 2
per cent, according to one analyst's estimate, much less than the 8 to 10
per cent margins which Kraft realises on its more profitable lines.
The highest profitability in the business is found at the opposite end - the
super-premiums. By catering to the whimsy of ice cream fanciers and their
inclination to indulge in the best quality, spare-no-expense super-premiums
such as Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Grand Metropolitan's Haagen Dazs have
flourished, while the premium segment, led by Breyers, has wilted. As part
of its acquisition, Unilever picks up Kraft's super-premium ice cream,
Frusen Gladje.
With the Kraft brands being squeezed at both ends, what attractions did the
business hold for Unilever?
Mr Salzman points out that the deal provides Unilever with an excellent
channel for distributing its novelty lines to US supermarkets. Production
facilities in several states are also included. However, Unilever may need
to invest heavily in building its own direct-to-store distribution system if
it expects the business to grow - a move Kraft was reluctant to make.
While the acquisition will bolster Unilever's US presence, it also presents
dangers. Margins are far less than it realises in its European ice cream
business, and Breyers and Sealtest show little promise of rebounding.
Consequently, most observers expect the group will look for 'synergies'. One
possibility is Unilever using the Breyers name to create cross-over products
which capitalise on the unusual flavours and ingredients of its novelty
lines.
Unilever declined to comment on its plans for the business. It has the
luxury of time. The acquisition comes at summer's end and the group can wait
several months before acting. It is apparent, however, that a fresh
marketing strategy is essential if Unilever is to succeed where Kraft did
not.
'If they are going to stand pat, then they probably haven't done a smart
thing in buying the business,' says Mr Waxman. 'But if they are going to
create something new, then Unilever may just pull the rabbit out of the
hat.'

A RADICALLY different information technology industry will emerge over the
next few years through consolidation in the semi-conductor business and the
disintegration of the traditional computer industry.
This was the view of industry leaders speaking yesterday at a major industry
conference in Barcelona. The Etre conference brings together leading figures
from the industry each year for two days of discussions and presentations.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microfsoft, the world's largest personal computer
software company, said that within three years software houses would no
longer market complete applications programs as at present. Instead, they
would develop pieces of software which could be connected together into
complex systems.
He predicted that within a few years, 90 per cent of personal computers
would have Microsoft's best-selling Windows program built in. The latest
development in Microsoft's family of Windows operating systems, codenamed
Cairo, would emerge from the laboratory in 18 months, he said. The new
system would have advanced features such as voice and handwriting
recognition built in.
Mr Gates said that developments in the computer industry would lead to an
information-rich society in which individuals might have to take explicit
steps to avoid bombardment with data. He said aeroplanes, hotels and theme
parks were the obvious candidates for sites where people could be supplied
with virtually unlimited information.
Mr Jerry Sanders, chief executive of AMD, a US semi-conductor company,
warned there would be no place for small, independent semi-conductor
companies in the volume IT markets of the late-1990s. He said the costs of
research and development coupled with the expense of building plants capable
of manufacturing chips with features smaller than half a millionth of a
metre meant that only the largest companies like Intel and AMD would be left
to fight it out.

<TEXT>
CHAUSSON, the French automobile company which is jointly owned by Peugeot
and Renault, said yesterday that it was suspending payments.
The group, which manufactures parts for France's two largest automobile
groups, said that it was forced into the decision by an increasingly
difficult financial situation and the failure of Renault and Peugeot to
agree on a restructuring package. Renault and Peugeot both own 48.5 per cent
of the company's shares.
Under French company law, Chausson will present its application to suspend
payments at a commercial tribunal. An administrator should then be
appointed.
The company said it will continue its production activities. These include
the manufacture of parts for the Renault Trafic, a small van, and for a
Peugeot utility vehicle. Until last March it had also produced parts for the
Peugeot 205.
Renault said yesterday it had been willing to pay half of a restructuring
package, estimated at FFr170m (Dollars 30m) for this year, if Peugeot would
pay the other half.
Peugeot declined to comment yesterday.

FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fortis takes ASLK-CGER stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, yesterday agreed to take
an initial 25 per cent stake in ASLK-CGER, the Belgian state-owned savings
group, for BFr15bn (Dollars 425m), as a first step towards acquiring a 50
per cent holding for a total of BFr35bn.
The deal, which hinged on yesterday's agreement by the Belgian government to
amend national legislation, effectively paves the way for the first big
privatisation under the country's four-year programme of selling off state
assets to reduce the budget deficit.
Fortis, which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium,
will deposit BFr15bn into an escrow account next week to pay for the 25 per
cent stake. The company will be given a put option on these shares in case
final agreement cannot be reached on the remaining 25 per cent stake.
It aims to buy a further 24.9 per cent stake by October 15 for BFr20bn. The
remaining 0.1 per cent stake will be transferred on January 1, 1995,
completing ASLK-CGER's transformation into a 50-50 private-public
partnership.
Under the legislative amendments approved in Brussels yesterday, the Belgian
government will be allowed to reduce its stake in ASLK-CGER to a minimum of
25.1 per cent. A Fortis spokeswoman in the Netherlands said the company may
be interested in lifting its stake above 50 per cent eventually, but added
that this was premature.
The company is examining how it will pay for its stake in ASLK-CGER, which,
like Fortis itself, is active in insurance and banking.

FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Japanese steelmakers see wider
losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading steel companies, hit by the prolonged economic slump and the
higher yen, warned of pre-tax losses for the current year to next March.
The announcements by Kawasaki Steel, NKK, Kobe Steel, and Sumitomo Metal
Industries, follow Nippon Steel's downward profit revision earlier this
week. Japan's steel companies have been hit by the sharp fall in demand from
its leading customers, including the car, electronics and construction
industries.
Although the companies had forecast first-half losses, they had hoped an
economic recovery in the second half would support profits for the whole
year. But the economy has remained lacklustre, and the appreciation in the
yen is delaying an upturn. The companies said they would omit interim
dividend payments.
Kawasaki predicted a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars 49m) for
the year on sales of Y1,040bn. It now expects a first-half pre-tax loss of
Y8bn instead of Y5bn as previously estimated.
Sumitomo Metal said it would post pre-tax losses of Y9bn on full-year sales
of Y1,110bn. Its interim pre-tax loss will widen to Y9bn from the initial
estimate of Y5bn.
NKK expects to break even for the year on a 0.5 per cent rise in sales to
Y1,270bn. For the first half, it will book profits of Y10bn from a change in
accounting method and Y10bn from sales of part of its securities portfolio.
However, it predicts an interim pre-tax loss of Y15bn on a 7 per cent fall
in sales to Y560bn.
Kobe Steel hopes to break even on a pre-tax profit basis on sales of
Y1,100bn. For the first half to September, Kobe expects pre-tax losses of
Y9bn on sales of Y550bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Indosuez, one of France's leading investment banks and a subsidiary
of the Suez holding company, saw net profits recover from FFr81m in the
first half of 1992 to FFr320m (Dollars 37m) in the same period this year,
helped by windfall profits from the European currency crisis.
The bank, which is heavily exposed to the Paris property market and was last
year forced to make steep provisions for its property losses, said the
improvement in this year's interim profits reflected growth in operating
income and tight cost control.
Indosuez was again forced to make substantial provisions of FFr1.31bn on
property and financial losses during the first half of 1993, against
FFr1.39bn at the interim stage last year. However, its gross operating
profits rose from FFr1.66bn to FFr2.63bn over the same period and costs were
static.
The company said it had made 'substantial profits' from capital and money
market instruments by benefiting from the changes in interest and exchange
rates during the first half.
It warned that the growth in gross operating profits might slow down during
the second half because of the sluggish economic environment and more stable
state of the capital markets.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME throws out copper
lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange threw out a lifeline this week to investors
struggling against the tide of support buying that has distorted copper
market prices throughout the summer.
Taking the view that a lacklustre world economy and excessively high stocks
of the metal pointed to a substantial slide in copper prices, these
investors made forward sales of copper they did not have in the hope of
being able to make covering purchases at lower prices before their short
positions fell due for delivery.
But they reckoned without the technical 'squeeze' that has propped up the
market since mid-June. While LME warehouse stocks were climbing to a 15-year
high tonnes, supplies available for immediate deliver dried up. This was
reflected in the normal cash discount (the 'contango' in trade jargon),
which reflects the costs of holding physical metal, being replaced by a
premium (or 'backwardation').
The culprit, LME traders alleged, was the Japanese Sumitomo metals group,
which they suggested might be preparing for a large-scale physical copper
deal. Sumitomo, however, has denied manipulating the market.
The LME first made known its uneasiness about the situation on July 14 when
it warned that it was monitoring the copper market. Two weeks later it went
a step further. Mr David King, the chief executive, strode on to the trading
floor to remind members that exchange rules gave the board draconian powers
to ensure that there was an orderly market. 'We wanted to make clear what
powers we have and that we won't hesitate to use them,' he said later.
But hesitate they did, much to the annoyance of many of the shorts. It was
not until Wednesday of this week, by which time the cash/three months
backwardation had grown from nil to Dollars 80, that the exchange decided to
act.
Mr King strode once more on to the floor to announce that the cash/one day
backwardation would until further notice be limited to Dollars 5 a tonne. If
shorts were unable to roll over due positions by 'borrowing' (simultaneously
buying cash and selling forward) in the market at a premium of less than
that level they could keep their positions open for another day by paying a
Dollars 5-a-tonne fee to the exchange.
Subsequently the cash/three months spread narrowed to Dollars 42 a tonne,
still Dollars 2.25 higher than at the end of last week, but, more
importantly, the September/October backwardation, which includes the most
critical delivery dates, came in from Dollars 55 to Dollars 35 a tonne.
Traders noted that trading in the copper options market market since Mr
King's declaration had concentrated on calls (selling options) for the near
months and puts (buying options) for January, indicating that traders
expected relatively tight conditions to remain for most of this year but to
ease in 1994.
With the squeeze perceived to be on the way out the market has begun to
reflect the fundamental supply/demand situation that led the speculators to
go short in the first place. The three months position closed yesterday at
Dollars 1,890.50 a tonne, down Dollars 64 on the week. In early trading
yesterday it twice bounced of the Dollars 1,880 mark, a breach of which
level, London broker GNI suggested in its daily Commodity Report, would
'indicate a sell-off to around Dollars 1,700'.
'There are bound to be some nervous moments in copper as tight September and
October dates unwind, but I only see three months headed one way,' one LME
trader told the Reuter news agency.
LME aluminium values also lost ground, partly because of spill-over
bearishness from copper. Traders said the contract's chart picture had
broken down as selling pressure from US investment funds and commission
houses triggered stop-loss selling orders. The three months price steadied
by Dollars 3.75 yesterday to close at Dollars 1,140.50 a tonne, but that was
still Dollars 21.75 down on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price suffered another significant
setback as the computer programmes used by some New York funds sent out
fresh 'sell' signals on Tuesday. The London price plunged Dollars 10.10 a
troy ounce that day and Dollars 2.50 the next. Thursday saw a Dollars 2.40
rally in response to the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts, but the New York
bears were in control again yesterday and the price ended the week Dollars
14.40 down at Dollars 349.85 an ounce, the first close below Dollars 350
since late April.
The London Commodity Exchange's robusta coffee futures moved to fresh 2 1/2
 year highs as the commencement of the export retention scheme on October 1
drew closer and producers talked of lifting the scheme's guide prices to
ensure that the planned 20 per cent would be held off the market. The recent
price rise has made it likely that under the agreed arrangements retention
will be scaled down to 10 per cent, or even suspended altogether, by the
time the scheme comes into force. The November position closed yesterday at
Dollars 1,296 a tonne, up Dollars 68 on the week, after peaking at Dollars
1,320.
Supply worries maintained the upward pressure in the LCE cocoa market, where
the December futures position touched Pounds 875 yesterday, before closing
at Pounds 856 a tonne, up Pounds 30 on the week.
In contrast oil prices, depressed by continuing Opec oversupply, slumped to
three-year lows. At London's International Petroleum Exchange the November
Brent crude futures position was trading late yesterday at Dollars 15.90 a
barrel, down 86 cents on the week.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PSB satisfies bid panel regarding stake in
ICD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BREACH of takeover rules by a group of investors who recently bought into
International Communications and Data has been rectified, the Takeover Panel
said yesterday.
The Panel ruled that the holding in ICD belonging to the investors led by
PSB Group, a direct marketing company, breached its substantial acquisition
rules. The group had acquired voting rights representing 23 per cent of
ICD's equity.
Under rules brought in to ensure that all shareholders can benefit from
takeover activity, the Panel's rules require investors to wait seven days
between purchases of 15 per cent tranches.
It therefore ruled that PSB must dispose of voting rights on 4.24m shares, 8
per cent of the equity, and could not vote them in the meantime. This ruling
had now been satisfied, the Panel said.
ICD expects to announce a pre-tax loss for the year to May 31 of Pounds 5m
in the next two weeks following a reorganisation.
It is opposed to the group, in which Mr John Porter, son of Dame Shirley,
the former leader of the City of Westminster Conservatives, is a 5 per cent
shareholder.
Mr David Cicurel, ICD's chairman, said: 'They have a lot of votes for very
little money risk and I would jolly well hope they have the interests of all
shareholders at heart.'

Headway, the consumer and industrial goods manufacturer announced pre-tax
profits 15.3 per cent ahead at Pounds 272,000, against Pounds 236,000, for
the year ended June 30.
This was boosted by a Pounds 194,000 net receipt from prior year business
disposals and a reduction in interest charges from Pounds 568,000 to Pounds
137,000.
Turnover was down by 12 per cent at Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 28.3m). Sales in
the consumer products division were down from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 17.9m,
a fall Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, attributed to the 'low level of demand
for garden furniture in the critical final quarter'.
Earnings per share rose by 23.1 per cent to 1.6p (1.3p) and an unchanged,
single, final dividend of 0.7p is recommended.

<TEXT>
In spite of a tough external environment and a currency devaluation on sugar
prices, which virtually increased by 20 per cent overnight, Armour Trust
recorded a 15 per cent improvement in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.6m.
Earnings worked through at 4.2p (3.7p) and a final dividend of 1.29p makes a
1.6365p (1.4885) total.
The group's interests are in confectionery and automotive accessories. The
directors stated that the former is currently trading 'at an equivalent
level to last year' while sales and profits in the automotive division in
the first quarter were higher than in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
Turnover for the 12 months to April 30 increased by 10 per cent to Pounds
24.6m.
The directors said they were examining ways to exploit Armour's potential
and believed the group was 'in an excellent position to respond to a
recovery in the economy.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rates hit Flogas profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Flogas, the supplier of liquefied petroleum gas in the UK and Ireland, has
blamed turbulence in exchange rates as the principal cause of a drop in
profits in the year ended June 30 1993.
Pre-tax profit reported for the year was down from IPounds 7.16m to IPounds
6.52m (Pounds 6.1m). But Mr Jim Flavin, chairman, said had the same exchange
rate been used throughout this year profits would have been IPounds 440,000
higher.
Start-up costs associated with natural gas business in Britain, R&amp;D
expenditure, the introduction of a twin share scheme which were written off,
had also created exceptional costs of IPounds 270,000.
Earnings per share were 23.31p (23.92p). The final dividend is 4.98p for an
unchanged total of 7.92p.
DCC, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, owns 60 per cent of the
capital.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Insurance gain keeps Gaskell in black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only an exceptional credit kept Gaskell, the carpet manufacturer, in profit
over the six months ended July 2. It made Pounds 393,000, against Pounds
15,000.
Mr Edward Andrew, chairman, said price cuts had to be made to defend the
market share, and that was successful in that turnover rose by 6 per cent
over the preceding half year. However, the pressure on margins led to a
turnround from an operating profit of Pounds 286,000 to a loss of Pounds
369,000.
The exceptional profit was Pounds 913,000, realised on fixed assets
destroyed by fire. The proceeds will enable the group to bring forward an
important item of capital investment in a second non-woven production line.
On the future, Mr Andrew said the market was slowly recovering and the order
books were beginning to increase for the first time since 1991.
Half year turnover was Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m). Earnings per share came to
5.2p (0.2p)and the interim dividend is again 1.5p.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hewetson shares fall on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hewetson fell 5p to close at 40p last night as the Hull-based
provider of goods and services to the construction industry warned that
results for the year to March 1994 would be below current market
expectations but not very different to the Pounds 503,000 achieved last
year.
The two main reasons were very low demand during July at Contract flooring
Sales, the flooring business, and a delay in the recovery of Hewetson
Floors, the raised access flooring business.
However, the directors said that unless conditions worsened there was no
reason to reduce the dividend below the 1.25p paid last year. In addition,
the balance sheet remained strong and the current investment programme would
enhance prospects, they said.

WITH ALL divisions, particul-arly contract hire, performing well, Bletchley
Motor lifted first half 1993 pre-tax profit from Pounds 604,000 to Pounds
785,000.
Mr David Dunn, chairman, said contract hire produced Pounds 473,000 (Pounds
324,000) as it continued to benefit from giving 'high quality service'.
Self-drive was at last emerging from the recession, and reduced costs and
increased demand pushed profits up to Pounds 73,000 (Pounds 11,000).
In car sales new vehicle registrations were ahead 9 per cent but at a small
cost to the used car business.
The chairman said that after-sales activities remained strong, despite
extended service intervals and improved vehicle reliability.
Turnover came to Pounds 39.6m (Pounds 35m) realising an operating surplus of
Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.26m). Interest costs were cut to Pounds 492,000
(Pounds 657,000).
Earnings per share worked through at 10.9p (11.4p) and the interim dividend

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Disposal puts Vinten in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPOSAL of a lossmaking defence business pushed Vinten, the camera
mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics group, into the red
for the first half of 1993.
A pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.71m was notched up after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 7.27m, made under FRS 3, for the sale of Exotic Materials, a
California-based manufacturer of parts for infra-red systems used by the
defence industry. The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.29m last time.
At the trading level profits were up nearly 24 per cent to Pounds 6m (Pounds
4.85m). The latest figure included a loss of Pounds 623,000 from the
discontinued division, and gains of Pounds 388,000 from acquisitions.
Turnover increased from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 43.7m.
Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said the disposal would eliminate
Vinten's exposure to the uncertain US defence markets. At the same time the
group had lifted both trading profit and revenues 'despite difficult
conditions'.
Three acquisitions were made during the half year that would strengthen the
group's position in the broadcast and photographic section of the business
which now accounted for the majority of turnover. Further benefits would
flow from the acquisitions in the second half, with the full benefit coming
through next year.
Net borrowings had increased by only Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 16.5m, however,
because of the group's strong operating cash flow, said Mr Baggott.
Losses per share were 7.2p (earnings 8.8p); taking out the exceptional items
gave earnings of 11.4p. The interim dividend is stepped up to 2.1p (1.9p).

WPP, the debt-ridden market-ing services company, has sold Seiniger
Advertising for Dollars 6.9m (Pounds 4.48m), of which Dollars 4.9m was paid
in cash and the balance in an interest bearing note repayable over five
years.
Seiniger is a Los Angeles-based producer of marketing campaigns for films.
It made a loss of Dollars 900,000 on revenues of Dollars 12m last year.
The sale gives rise to an exceptional non-cash charge of Dollars 12m due to
the implementation of the UK accounting standard requiring goodwill
previously written off to reserves to be written off to the profit and loss
account.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick subsidiary launches Lloyd's fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLM Advisers, a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker,
yesterday announced the formal launch of its CLM Insurance Fund, an
incorporated Name at the Lloyd's insurance market.
The launch comes ahead of the expected announcement on Monday of new Lloyd's
rules outlining the accounting, regulatory and legal treatment of corporate
investors.
Other investment and merchant banks have also announced their intention to
launch similar vehicles but the sponsors of the CLM fund, Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, are the first to issue an information memorandum.
Mr Michael Wade, chief executive of CLM Advisers, said he expected
'considerable interest from both private and institutional investors' in the
fund which will be managed so as to qualify as an investment trust for UK
tax purposes.
It is understood that BZW will seek to raise more than Pounds 100m when it
floats the fund later this year. A prospectus inviting investors to
subscribe to the fund will be published during October so that the fund can
participate in Lloyd's for the 1994 year of account.
The fund's board will be chaired by Lord Rees, a former chief secretary to
the treasury.
Like existing individual Names, new corporate Names will be able to 'use
their capital twice'. Capital used to support insurance activities will also
be invested in other assets. The CLM fund will participate in a range of
Lloyd's syndicates, via six subsidiary incorporated names, investing mainly
in a portfolio of UK equities.
Investment managers BZW Investment will aim to track the FT-A All Share
index.

explaining why she had rented a bed to Nicola Rogers, the 13 year old
runaway.
There was also of course details on the Pounds 500,000 Bono Bingo and the
winner of the Pounds 50,000 mortgage competition. On page two there was a
modest story on Israeli Peace Deal With PLO.
To potential investors in Mirror Group Newspapers, which is now emerging
from the long shadow of Robert Maxwell, the most interesting item on the
front page appeared in very restrained type - the 27p cover price. Since
July 12 the Daily Mirror has been 7p more expensive than its main opposition
The Sun and the differential appears to have made very little difference.
The Sun's price-cutting activity, and marketing ploys such as giving the
paper away at Shell garages, has generated a degree of excitement which has
pushed the popular tabloid market up by about 2.5 per cent overall.
The Sun is up by 300,000 to 3.83m, the Daily Star is up with the help of its
Pot of Gold promotion but perhaps the most remarkable thing is that the
readership of the Daily Mirror has stayed loyal.
Indeed the August circulation was 63,000 up on July.
The fact that the full frontal attack by The Sun has not dented the
circulation of the Daily Mirror removed another in a long line of
uncertainties that could have delayed the sale of the 54.8 per cent of MGN
now effectively owned by a range of banks owed money by the later Mr
Maxwell.
The last big hurdle was finally cleared earlier this week when the newspaper
group, whose publications also include The Sunday Mirror, People and Daily
Record in Scotland, agreed to settle a series of disputes with the private
companies in the Maxwell empire.
The deal, which will save MGN nearly Pounds 70m in tax and costs, involves
waiving potential net claims of at least Pounds 130m and in turn having
legal claims against the newspaper group waived.
The extent to which MGN has recovered from the financial and editorial
depredations of its former proprietor will become apparent on Wednesday when
MGN announces its interim results. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits
of between Pounds 28m and Pounds 30m compared with Pounds 16m. Mr Derek
Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, is going for
Pounds 31m and it is likely that the results will be at the upper end of
analyst's expectations.
. The prospect of a single buyer for the stake has now been all but ruled
out on the grounds that there are no obvious candidates around - or at least
candidates who would not become immediately entangled in monopolies
legislation.
All the signs now are that a private placing among a wide range of
institutions is being planned.
This will please the existing management of MGN, under Mr David Montgomery,
the chief executive, who see a wide range of City investors as the best
guarantee of the newspaper group's independence.
No final date, it is believed, has been set for a disposal, but unless
market conditions deteriorate unexpectedly MGN could be a publicly quoted
newspaper with conventional shareholders within two months.
With the present MGN share price at 178p, even with an appreciable discount
banks such as the National Westminster, holding MGN shares as security for
Maxwell debt should do well out of the disposal. Terms vary but most will
make something on their deals that would have looked implausible in the days
when horrific revelations followed each other on the state of the Maxwell
finances.
Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, joint administrator to the Maxwell
private interests, should also be able to make a little extra from the sale
to distribute to other Maxwell creditors.
Despite intense competition in the popular newspaper market and a worrying
downward trend in face of growing competition from the electronic media the
outlook for MGN looks strong. Printing in Oldham is already making 64-page
papers possible for the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail on Friday, Saturday
and Sunday.
The first of the new printing presses being installed on the outskirts of
Glasgow will come on stream in July further strengthening the Scottish paper
in the battle with The Sun.
Many of the Mirror's most distinctive voices have been either sacked or have
left the paper but 50 new journalists are being hired and the paper has not
joined the ranks of the Tory press as many feared.
Yesterday's political comment may have been restrained by historic
standards. But it still reminded readers how overall tax has risen under the
governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major and advised the Prime
Minister to 'scrap the heating tax now.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Stockbroker dismantled by Banque Indosuez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Indosuez yesterday confirmed changes that will dismantle Carr Kitcat
&amp; Aitken, a firm bearing some of the oldest names in British stockbroking,
writes Peter John.
The firm, part of the French bank's WI Carr Group, will be renamed Indosuez
Capital Securities with most of the broker's UK institutional client
operations being abandoned, along with all of its research operation.
As a result of the changes 40 staff, mainly UK institutional sales people
and analysts, will lose their jobs.
The new organisation will carry out its institutional business in five broad
areas - Europe, natural resources and South Africa, the Far East, Latin
America and gilts. It will also offer a 'limited service' in UK equities to
institutions.
Meanwhile, Banque Indosuez will concentrate its private client business
through Carr Sheppards in London and Le Masurier James and Chinn in Jersey.
Yesterday's changes were announced to coincide with Banque Indosuez's
half-year results statement. However, rumours of the change had circulated
among London marketmakers for the past fortnight.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bardon in loss after Pounds 60m provision
against US sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARDON, the debt-burdened quarry products group, made a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 59.5m for the six months to June 30 compared with profits of Pounds
4.6m, after providing for a one-off Pounds 60m provision against a US
investment it plans to sell.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, expected slow improvement. 'There are clear
signs of an underlying recovery in orders, with encouraging volume increases
in most areas of our business. The critical issue is pricing, which has been
much slower to respond.'
He forecast an unchanged dividend of 2p for 1993, and the interim is again
0.8p. Losses per share were 17p (earnings 0.5p) and 0.4p adjusting for the
exceptionals.
Turnover improved to Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 151.4m), mainly on US orders. Mr
Tom said: 'These are very large jobs so you don't actually get an immediate
benefit. In the current year we will see some benefit, but not as great as
people might expect.'
Bardon Roadstone, the English quarrying business, enjoyed a sound half year.
It met its budget despite a fall in aggregates demand in the UK.
Operating profit dropped to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 13.4m) as both the Scottish
businesses performed poorly compared with the previous period. Operating
profits from US operations fell because of disposals and exchange rate
effects.
Net interest charge declined to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.8m) and borrowings at
the half-way stage stood at Pounds 312m (Pounds 237m) before a Pounds 72m
rights issue in July.
'The interest cost was little changed, on reduced dollar debt, due to the
lower exchange rate this year. This more than offset the benefit of a
stronger dollar on US earnings, which are seasonally low in the first half,'
Sir Peter Parker, chairman, said.
In addition to the rights issue, Bardon is planning a private placement of
US loan notes worth Dollars 72m. This should reduce gearing to 60 per cent.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Renamed Ratners loses Pounds 27m in dull
first half - Waiting for Christmas to put a sparkle in Signet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS jewellery shops, lumbered with an image problem ever since their
founder's disparaging comments on some of the merchandise, are fading from
the nation's High Streets almost as fast as they sprang up in the heady
1980s.
The number of stores bearing Mr Gerald Ratner's name has been cut by new
management from a peak of 250 to 140.
But like-for-like sales at the remaining stores were down 12 per cent in the
first half this year.
So a further 40 stores are to be converted into H Samuel branches, a more
up-market format.
By this time next year, only 60 Ratner shops will remain.
In a further break with its past, the company won agreement from
shareholders at yesterday's AGM to change its name to Signet Group.
Mr James McAdam, chairman, described the Ratners shops as one of Signet's
'two problem children'.
Its falling sales were in sharp contrast with the group's other jewellery
chains - H Samuel and Ernest Jones - which were 2 per cent and 4 per cent
ahead respectively. The group has 1,800 shops in total.
The other 'problem child' is Salisbury's, the bags and luggage store, where
like-for-like sales were down 8 per cent.
A new management team has been installed and the strategy behind the chain
is under review.
The group cut its pre-tax loss in the six months to July 31 to Pounds 26.9m
(Pounds 27.7m), while the operating loss from continuing operations fell 34
per cent to Pounds 11.7m.
The reduction of Pounds 6.17m in the operating loss from Pounds 17.8m last
time reflected a Pounds 4.4m real improvement, with the rest coming from
exchange rate benefits. The pre-tax loss last time included a gain of Pounds
3.7m on the disposal of discontinued operations.
Mr McAdam said that the first half results gave no real indication of the
group's progress so far as its trading was so heavily weighted towards
Christmas - but he would not be drawn into making any predictions for the
Christmas season.
Total turnover for the group rose to Pounds 399.7m from Pounds 363.1m. But
at constant exchange rates turnover was down 3 per cent, reflecting the
effects of the store closure programme.
Like for like sales were, however, 2 per cent ahead.
Last year's improvement in gross margins from 51.9 per cent to 57.2 per
cent, thanks to lower levels of discounting in the UK and cost savings from
store closures, had been maintained.
In the US like for like sales were 5 per cent ahead.
Total interest payable was up to Pounds 15.3m from Pounds 12.3m.
With US borrowings - legacy of a 1980s acquisition binge, inflated by
sterling's devaluation - net group debt rose to Pounds 332m at July 31 from
Pounds 255.7m a year earlier.
The loss per share was 10.9p, against a previous 10.6p.
Dividend payments on preference shares remain suspended.
There is no interim dividend.
Mr Gerald Ratner left the group last November. Last month the company's
annual report showed that he and his cousin Victor had shared pay-offs for
loss of office of more than Pounds 1m last year.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: James Beattie falls 31% to Pounds 1.22m at
half year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ERIC Pountain, chairman of James Beattie, the West Midlands stores
group, yesterday reported a 31 per cent fall in profits from Pounds 1.76m to
Pounds 1.22m pre-tax for the half year ended July 31.
He said trading conditions had 'continued to suffer from the measure of
uncertainty which has inhibited consumer spending for so long'.
On a more confident note, Sir Eric said there were grounds 'for belief that
the worst effects of the recession have worked through'.
First-half sales, excluding VAT, rose by 5.1 per cent to Pounds 31.9m. The
figure included a six months' contribution from the Worcester store against
four months last year.
Operating profits declined to Pounds 595,000 (Pounds 725,000) while
investment income and interest dropped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 626,000.
Earnings fell to 1.73p (2.51p) but the interim dividend is being lifted from
1.4p to 1.5p.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Gloom behind the glamour: Big car makers are following their
customers downmarket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motor industry moguls have already checked out of Frankfurt. The circus
touches down next in Tokyo in October. Sadly the champagne, the canapes and
the elegant hostesses have largely disappeared too - to be replaced by the
smell of sweat, stale beer and sausages along the concrete walkways.
It is the turn of the customers this weekend to push and crane to ogle the
show of shiny metal that the best of the world's motor industry have put on
display.
More than 900,000 visitors are expected to have elbowed their way through
the crush of the endless halls of Frankfurt's biennial motor show, Europe's
biggest, by the end of next week.
But how many of them will come out and buy? If the industry's wise men are
right, 2m-2.5m fewer new cars will leave showrooms across Europe this year,
with German sales alone forecast to fall by about 900,000.
Four years ago Frankfurt was dominated by green issues and sales were
roaring along at record levels. Now every new car has its catalytic
convertor, every engine has swapped its carburettor for fuel injection.
Recycling strategies are in place.
Then two years ago it was safety - and sales were still at a record level.
Now everyone has a safety package too, boasting airbags - preferably
passenger and driver-side - safety belt pre-tensioners or 'grabbers',
anti-submarining seats and reinforced cages for the passenger compartment.
So what of 1993? First, the Frankfurt show will be remembered as the moment
when Mercedes-Benz and BMW, arguably the world's top two makers of up-market
executive and luxury cars, showed the world they were in earnest about
diving down to the small car market to try to capture more of Europe's
dwindling band of vehicle buyers.
BMW's bright-red E1 concept car - a choice of petrol or electric propulsion,
a 'greenhouse' roof and about the size of a Ford Fiesta - will not be on the
roads for a few years, though it is already being driven inside the
showgrounds.
In a more restrained shade of metallic blue Mercedes-Benz is unveiling its
Vision A 93 small concept car amid floodlights and pounding rock music.
Shorter than a Rover Metro or a Renault Clio, with a high roof to allow the
engine and gearbox to be located beneath the four-seat passenger
compartment, the Vision A 93 is a far cry from Mercedes-Benz's leviathan
two-tonne S-Class launched only two years ago.
Mr Helmut Werner, who is rapidly emerging as a revol-utionary new chief
executive at Mercedes-Benz, is adamant that a small car will be in
production by '1997 at the latest'.
'The S-Class was our premium profit producer, but this has changed and we
must act accordingly. Our customers are on the move into market segments
they have not been in before. They are also buying small cars. We have to be
sure we follow our customers.'
Frankfurt '93 will be remembered too for aluminium. Audi, the up-market car
division of the Volkswagen group, unveiled its near-production concept for a
top-of-the-range luxury car with an all-aluminium body. The real thing
should be launched next year.
'We have to get away from the spiralling weight of cars,' says Professor
Ulrich Seiffert, one of the losers and winners in this year's game of
management musical chairs at the top of the embattled VW group. Swept away
from the Volkswagen main management board to the VW division by Mr Ferdinand
Piech's clean broom at the start of the year, he has just been reinstated as
the group's research and development director. 'In the past 10-15 years
150kgs has been added to the average weight of a car. We have to bring the
weight spiral down.'
And Frankfurt will be remembered for gloom.
Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, held its Frankfurt
party at the city's Rebstockbad, a fancy complex of swimming pools, water
chutes and saunas.
Traditionally the party is a fiesta, but this year the evening's highlight
of a trapeze artist swinging high above the pool with only the water for a
safety net was uncomfortably reminiscent of the predicament of most of the
European car industry's top executives.
With little visible form of support they are swinging above an abyss of
mounting losses, job cuts, restructuring and cost-cutting.
It was left to the industry's leading showman Mr Bob Lutz, ex-BMW, ex-Ford,
and now president of Chrysler to give the show some old-time razzmatazz with
the world launch of the US carmaker's all-new Neon small car. At a recent
Detroit motor show he launched the group's new Jeep Grand Cherokee
sports/utility by driving it up the steps of the main entrance and in
through a plate-glass window. This year in Detroit he dropped his Dodge Ram
pickup down from the roof.
And in Frankfurt? Now with steely grey crew-cut and the look of a US Marines
commander, Mr Lutz turned the Chrysler stand and arena into a giant pin-ball
machine, so that the stage could flash up the message that the Neon marked
the start of a whole 'New Game' in the world small car market.
Most of the car industry does not like the current game very much, but at
least Mr Lutz could growl with satisfaction: 'Now that was a real launch.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / A few wrinkles in a maturing business: Alan Pike on possible
reforms at UK residential homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are residential homes good places for your elderly mother? Are they good
places to invest your money?
The questions are closely linked. This week came evidence that the UK
government is considering relaxing regulations on care homes as part of its
drive against red-tape. The move comes soon after a series of market
flotations by leading private sector operators. While no operator wants
unnecessary regulation, there is awareness that scandals in badly-run,
poorly-inspected homes could damage the prospects of a developing sector.
Private homes underwent astonishing growth in the 1980s - places rose from
less than 50,000 in 1981 to more than 150,000 10 years later. On the basis
of statistics alone, residential care is a business that cannot fail in the
1990s. The proportion of elderly people is rising - one-fifth of the
population will be over 65 by 2021, twice as many as in 1951. There will be
a sharp increase in the over 80s, while changes in family structure mean
fewer dependent elderly people are living with their children.
But such trends alone cannot guarantee a successful business. The explosive
growth of private homes in the 1980s resulted from two exceptional factors.
Rising property values helped make owner-managed homes an easy and
apparently low-risk small business to launch. And the right of many elderly
 -who often would have been unable to pay their own fees - to social
security funding meant proprietors could rely on a regular income. State
funding of residents in private and charitable homes rose from Pounds 10m in
1979 to Pounds 2.5bn this year.
The property market is now less friendly, leaving some individual homeowners
with negative equity in rambling old houses with high maintenance costs.
Since the introduction of the government's community care reforms in April,
people entering homes for the first time no longer qualify for automatic
state-funding.
Local authorities now assess individual needs, and are encouraged by the
government to help the elderly remain in their own homes. A report by the
Commons' health committee in the summer predicted that, during the next few
years, the new arrangements would lead to a big shake-out of independent
residential and nursing home providers - 'painful for owners but even more
traumatic for residents if they find themselves uprooted from the places
they have come to consider their homes'.
The homeowners that appear best placed to survive any shake-out are the
bigger operators. There are about 20 quoted companies in the residential
care field. Of the two largest, Westminster Health Care saw pre-tax profits
rise to Pounds 4.3m in 1992-93 from Pounds 1.7m the year before. Takare last
month reported a 17 per cent rise in interim profits to Pounds 6.9m.
Big operators still only account for a small part of the market. Takare, one
of the biggest companies of its type in Europe, has little more than 2 per
cent of the UK market.
Like the hotel and catering industry, residential care will always retain a
place for owner-managed establishments. But the large companies have
considerable advantages.
Using modern purpose-built accommodation and benefiting from economies of
scale in areas such as staff training, corporate operators are agreeing
long-term contracts with public authorities to house substantial numbers of
clients - providing competitive rates for the authorities and a guaranteed
revenue stream for the companies. The next likely development is leasing
schemes, with property companies building cost-effective homes and
specialist care companies running them.
Though no operator will be exempt from competition caused by the shift of
emphasis in public funding to domiciliary care, the market will be
underpinned in the long term by demographic trends and the expected growth
of insurance policies taken out by working people to pay for residential
care in later life.
But there is no desire in the sector for a battle in which operators compete
by cutting standards. What the sector is demanding is more consistency in
regulations and contracts across the UK.
'Our homes have bedrooms with 35 per cent more space than required by law
and corridors that are 60 per cent wider than the prescribed minimum,' says
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman of Takare. 'I don't want people trading who are
not prepared to invest in acceptable standards. I am quite prepared to jump
through the hoops of regulation. But I need to know that the hoops in
Bradford are the same as those in Birmingham.'
His comments reflect widespread concern in the sector that April's reforms,
under which residents enter homes on the basis of contracts drawn up by
individual local authorities, are creating inconsistencies.
Methodist Homes for the Aged - one of the biggest charity home operators -
deals with 116 local authorities, for instance. 'Some operate only at the
minimum standards of the Residential Homes Act, which we regard as low,'
says Mr Phillip Barkett, operations director. 'Others take basic contracts
that it might be reasonable to apply to refuse collection and try to use
them in residential care. Some make specific demands - such as insisting in
contracts that residents must be served a hot drink within a stated number
of minutes of waking up in the morning.'
Standardisation of contracts between local authorities would, home operators
believe, reduce bureaucracy, assist inspection and help create a level
market around the country.
'At the moment many local authorities are driving hard bargains in contract
negotiations, while the same authorities are making lavish demands when
setting standards,' says Eunice Paxman, who chairs the National Care Homes
Association.
There will be few calls from the sector to abandon regulation but operators
feel the government's community care reforms, designed to increase
individual choice, are creating conflicting demands in which the maintenance
of standards, and the sector's prosperity, will become more difficult.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Showdown at the French corral: David Buchan on threats to
veto the US-EC farm trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French ministers dress up their case for a better Gatt deal for French and
European agriculture in the high-minded motto of the French revolution and
republic.
First, liberte for France to maintain its 'vocation' as the world's
second-biggest agricultural exporter. Second, egalite of sacrifice between
the farmers of Europe and France and those of the US. Finally, fraternite in
the form of a 'peace clause' which would extend the protection for the EC's
reformed Common Agricultural Policy from American legal attack well into the
next century.
But behind this rhetoric and demands lies a deadly political game. A French
veto of the US-EC draft farm trade agreement, perhaps as early as the
September 20 meeting of the EC ministers in Brussels, would have serious
consequences for France's relations with its European partners, for what
remains of Community solidarity, and for the fate of the seven-year-old
Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations.
For the odds are still that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will be driven
to carry out his threat to 'go to the end of our determination, our
firmness' in getting major revisions in the draft farm accord which the
European Commission negotiated with the US last November.
This so-called Blair House agreement would, France insists, go far beyond
the production curbs in the last year's EC reform of Common Agricultural
Policy. Instead of having to take 15 per cent of land out of production - as
agreed in the EC's own reform - French farm unions say that implementing
Blair House would lead to an idling of more than 30 per cent of land, and
halve France's pork production and reduce its cereals output by 25 per cent.
For France, the most objectionable aspect of Blair House is the requirement
that the EC should reduce the volume of its subsidised exports by 21 per
cent over six years. By contrast, French ministers say their farmers can
live with Blair House's proposed 36 per cent cut in the value of exports
subsidies.
It has made this gesture partly to show that it is not totally closed to
change and partly to frighten its partners by reminding them that, after
all, the big cereal farmers in the plains around Paris are Europe's most
competitive.
The possibility of a last-minute compromise has increased as French
diplomacy has gone into overdrive, bombarding EC partners and the Commission
with a series of proposed modifications and clarifications to Blair House.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also, by his own account, trying to broker some
compromise. The German leader told Mr Balladur that President Clinton
informed him in a telephone conversation that the US 'understood' France's
reservations, even if it did not agree to with them.
Mr Balladur's threat of a veto may be a bluff. But it would be dangerous to
count on this. France has no pro-Gatt lobby and industrialists are chary of
speaking up against farm interests.
The reluctance of a prime minister with a record high standing in opinion
polls to face down farmers, which comprise six per cent of workforce, may
seem odd. But last year the then Socialist government escaped defeat on a
parliamentary censure motion by four votes after having accepted the May
1992 CAP reform.
This time, on the even more emotive issue of a Gatt deal, Mr Balladur might
not be so lucky. If his ministers are unable to return to Paris with some
key concessions he might find his poll ratings pulverised.
Within his own party there are those who have been sharpening swords for Mr
Balladur to fall on. Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR president of the National
Assembly, has championed 'an alternative policy' on Europe, Gatt and the
economy, as a presidential platform for Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR candidate
to run on. The latter, whose populism goes down better with the farmers than
Mr Balladur's patrician style, would not lightly ditch Mr Balladur. But he
is unlikely to let his long friendship with Mr Balladur stand in the way of
his 20 year quest to win the Elysee Palace.
Fully aware of his appalling dilemma, Mr Balladur, has not been drifting
passively towards the rocks of Blair House over his six months in office.
He quietly approved in June formal EC acceptance of the ceiling on European
oilseed production that had been negotiated as a side-element to Blair
House. He concluded that by accepting what was basically a good deal for EC
and French oilseed producers, France could both give concrete proof of its
new-found reasonableness and win concessions on other, more distasteful
aspects of Blair House.
For a time, France's two main farm unions, the FNSEA and CNJA which
represent more than half the country's 1m full-time farmers, took their tune
from Mr Balladur. What trouble there was during the summer was largely
directed against imports of fish, fruit and vegetables, largely outside the
EC price support regime and therefore the scope of Gatt.
France also acquiesced in the industrial tariff cuts agreed by the Group of
Seven countries at the Tokyo summit in early July, without getting a whisper
of a promise to reopen Blair House. But just as Mr Balladur began to feel
completely caught between his farmers' continued intransigence against the
basic provisions of Blair House and his foreign partners' insistence that
Blair House was a fixed deal, and that the Gatt talks must move on to fresh
ground, a ray of hope emerged  - from of all things the August crisis in the
European monetary system.
That momentous cloud had a silver lining, because it suddenly disposed Mr
Kohl to listen to French complaints. Since early August, farmers in
countries like France, whose currencies depreciate, get a better return for
their crops, once the common Ecu price is translated into national money.
Exactly the opposite is happening in Germany, whose farmers now face lower
D-mark prices for their products everytime the D-mark rises. With election
looming, the prospect of having discontented farmers on his hands disturbs
Mr Kohl.
'France wants Germany to help remove Blair House's provision for a 21 per
cent reduction in the volume of subsidised exports,' says a French minister,
explaining the basis of recent discussions between the two countries. 'In
return Germany wants France's help in preventing a fall in German farm
prices.'
As a fall-back - in the event that it cannot get EC partners to agree to
demands from the US for a scrapping of the 21 per cent cut - France is
proposing that the reduction should apply to a smaller category of goods. It
suggests food aid, processed products and existing silo stocks could be
subtracted from list to which the cut would apply.
Whether this would be negotiable in Washington is something which Mr Kohl
has been trying to establish. Certainly, anything seems worth trying to
avoid the dreadful dilemma between France losing the most pro-European prime
minister it is likely to have for the foreseeable future, and Mr Balladur
keeping himself in power by using the French veto, which would damage an
already enfeebled Community.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Risk from radioactive discharges
meaningless without a time scale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir FREDERICK WARNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The director of science, Greenpeace UK, writes in criticism of science
in environmental policy (Letters, September 8). She says that the government
assumes that a one in 10,000 risk of dying as a result of radioactive
discharges is acceptable. This is meaningless with no time scale.
She should ask Brian Wynne for the Royal Society publication, Risk-Analysis,
Perception, Management 1992, to which he contributed. This defines risk as
the probability that a particular adverse event occurs during a stated
period of time, or results from a particular hazard. Risk of death is one of
the events on which statistics going back many years are unarguable. A risk
of one in 10,000 a year is roughly that in road accidents. It is accepted by
anyone who ventures on the road. The official estimates of one in a million
a year from radioactive discharges (HMSO 1984) are made from the experience
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They could be more accurate as a result of work
at present planned.
Your editorial of the same date ('Green agenda') underlines the need for
social scientists and economists to work alongside natural scientists. The
Royal Society report showed the difficulties. There is a need for better
knowledge of costs and benefits to use resources sensibly. The precautionary
principle is flawed without the concept of proportionality.
The Health and Safety Executive conference, October 1992, has produced two
large volumes of required reading. It has a page from the US Office of
Management and Budget showing the cost of preventing one premature death as
Dollars 100,000 for seat-belt regulations, up to Dollars 110.7m for the ban
on asbestos. It underpins the priority given by the president to cutting
down regulations.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Better a sympathetic encounter while
walking in wine country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CORNISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having just read Nigel Buxton's informative and useful new book,
Walking in Wine Country, I was mystified by Giles MacDonogh's review (Food &amp;
Drink: 'Lo's life and times', September 4). If Nigel Buxton met with much
friendliness on his walks, regardless of whether or not he immediately
disclosed that he was a writer, in contrast to Mr MacDonogh's experiences, I
fear Mr MacDonogh must face the possibility that he may appear less pleasant
and sympathetic to meet on such occasions than Mr Buxton.
I hope therefore that Mr Buxton will take more walks in wine country for our
benefit and I suggest that Mr MacDonogh stay in his car when next in those
parts.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A case of financial incompatibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID G WALLACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Norma Cohen's article, 'Doors slam shut in salesman's face' (September
8), revealed some interesting figures. I believe she should have gone
further in terms of explaining the implications.
At the moment the commission payable on an annual premium personal pension
plan is broadly related to the potential premium paying term to retirement -
in other words, the greater the difference between the starting age and the
retirement age, the higher the commission paid. For example, where a client
pays a premium of Pounds 10,000, which is classified as 'annual', a sum of
about Pounds 8,000 would be stripped out in commission over a period of just
more than two years. By contrast were the premium to be classified as
'single' the commission taken out and payable immediately would be
equivalent to about Pounds 480.
Independent intermediaries are certainly not above criticism where the
question of commission is concerned, but it is interesting to note from the
figures produced in your article that those employed by the banks and
building societies as salesmen of 'tied' products sell 150 per cent more
personal pensions classified as annual rather than single. By contrast,
'insurance brokers, solicitors, accountants and others' (independent
intermediaries) sell 34 per cent less annual vis a vis single.
If Mr Wadsworth of consulting actuaries Watson &amp; Company is right about
bancassurance accounting for 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the UK retail
financial services market by the end of the decade, these figures must be
cause for concern as far as the consumer is concerned.
In our view commission and financial advice make incompatible bedfellows. As
fee-charging independent financial advisers we believe the figures prove
that not nearly enough has been done to raise the public awareness of the
increasing trend towards poorer value for money products.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Engineers must take real control of
profession if their lot is to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL CHARLTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I am thrilled the director general of the Engineering Council
(Letters, September 6) considers engineering to be an 'attractive,
stimulating and rewarding option', I can give several reasons why it is not.
First, if he regards an average salary of Pounds 31,768, or the statistic
that 8 per cent earned more than Pounds 50,000 a year, satisfactory, he is
sadly mistaken. He most sincerely would feel so if he tried to raise a
family in south-east England on that salary level. Although still young for
a chartered engineer, I already earn more than twice the average for an
engineer of any age outside the profession in a non-City, non-selling role.
Second, the proportion of engineers recommending engineering as a career is
irrelevant. Engineers have always recommended engineering as a profession.
They are obliged to. They should have been asked how many of their children,
who were academically capable, have chosen engineering as a profession. I
suspect a very different response would have been obtained.
Third, any profession promoting itself towards women has, by inference, the
intention of becoming a low-paid one (sorry ladies, but as an ex-engineer I
am being realistic). Fourth, if engineering is that good, why does one top
UK business school still limit the number of civil engineers, most of whom
are looking for an exit route, on its MBA course?
Not until the supply and demand of engineers is controlled by the profession
(and taken out of the hands of academics), and the profession decides to run
itself like a profession rather than an amateur cricket club, and engineers
get involved in the commercial aspects of their businesses, will the lot of
engineers change. Paul Charlton,

FT  11 SEP 93 / Man in the News: Hard wear for a software warrior - Ray
Noorda / Louise Kehoe and Geof Wheelwright on the 'Mr Nice Guy' who has
taken on Bill Gates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Noorda, 69, looks like everyone's favourite grandad. The chairman and
chief executive of Novell, the world's second-largest personal computer
software company - after its arch-rival Microsoft - drives a pick-up truck
to work in Provo, Utah, and decorates his offices with folksy Norman
Rockwell prints inscribed with uplifting mottoes.
A more unlikely adversary of Bill Gates, the testy, boyish multi-billionaire
chairman of Microsoft is hard to imagine. Yet 'Mr Nice Guy' Noorda, has
shown that beneath the amiable exterior lies a determination to influence
the direction of the computer industry. And that means putting Gates in his
place.
This week, it emerged that Novell has filed an anti-trust complaint against
Microsoft with European Community competition authorities. Novell has also
played an active role, behind the scenes, in providing information to US
authorities, leading to a justice department anti-trust probe of Microsoft.
Clearly rattled, Gates has lashed out at Noorda. 'He has a tremendous
vendetta against us. Novell has made a conscious decision to spread lies
about us,' he has charged.
Responding calmly, Noorda says: 'We have felt that Microsoft has broken
certain principles or codes of doing business. Wherever we see unfair
practices . . . particularly if we feel they are injurious to the industry
at large, we will probably complain to the recognised authorities.'
Noorda defers to his lawyers on details of the complaint to the EC, which
alleges Microsoft has abused its dominant market position in personal
computer operating systems to restrict competition.
He is, however, forthright on the principle involved. 'Competition is
absolutely necessary for anybody to improve what they are doing. So it
wouldn't be good either for Microsoft or for the industry if they were to
achieve a monopoly.'
Gates 'is not a bad guy, he is a young guy,' Noorda adds. 'In my more than
40 years in the industry I have not met a bunch like them. They are
possessive, aggressive and strong challengers, but they are afraid of
head-on competition and that is anathema to me.'
Noorda's outlook has been shaped by attempts to compete with Microsoft in
the market for PC operating systems. Novell charges that Microsoft protects
its share of this segment of the software business - more than 90 per cent -
through restrictive licensing schemes.
Adding fuel to perceptions of uncompetitive trading is the abortive merger
plan between the two companies, initiated by Gates last year, which was
called off when Microsoft acquired another software company without telling
Novell. Noorda says: 'I don't know what their motives were. I can only
speculate. But perhaps they were trying to slow us down.'
Noorda warns that computer users do not benefit if one company - be it
Microsoft or IBM - becomes so dominant that it can dictate 'how the game is
played'.
During a career which began in the era of punch cards, Noorda believes the
most significant technological change has been the emergence of the
'networking environment' in which different types of computer are linked
throughout an organisation, sharing information and processing tasks.
'Today, the customers demand that everything has to work together,' Noorda
says. 'That means that everyone in the computer industry has to work
together. We have tried to make a successful business out of working with
companies who would otherwise be called our competitors.'
Noorda has coined the word 'co-opetition' to describe the complex
relationships which can bring competitors to share, for example, technical
details of forthcoming products to ensure that they work together. 'We feel
that he who will co-operate the most with competitors will be the
longer-term survivor,' Noorda says.
This does not mean Noorda is a push over. Indeed, Novell is one of the few
companies in the software industry that has gone head to head with Microsoft
and won.
Since he acquired Novell 10 years ago, Noorda has transformed what was a
failing computer company into the leading supplier of software for personal
computer networks, with more than 70 per cent of the world market. Turnover
has increased from Dollars 3.8m in 1983 to Dollars 933m for its fiscal year
ended October 31 1992.
In the process, Noorda, with about 11 per cent of Novell's stock, has become
a billionaire. But money does not seem to excite him. Until last year he
drew a modest salary of Dollars 38,000 a year, preferring, he said, to spend
money on hiring. The board of directors forced him to raise his salary to
Dollars 198,000 after Wall Street observers suggested his commitment to the
company might appear to be in doubt.
Since he took over at Novell, Noorda has acquired 15 smaller companies,
expanding Novell's technology base and demonstrating a rare ability
successfully to manage mergers. The largest acquisition, completed in June,
with the Dollars 322m purchase of Unix System Laboratories, a former AT&amp;T
subsidiary, may stretch those skills. Assimilating USL's employees is a
challenge, Noorda concedes. The recent departure of Roel Pieper, former
president and chief executive of USL and a respected industry executive, for
'personal reasons', hints at how difficult the adjustment may be.
The purchase of USL will also test Noorda's 'co-opetition' philosophy.
Novell now controls Unix, the widely used computer operating system. This
makes Noorda the referee in an industry-wide feud over competing versions of
the program. The acquisition also places Novell in head-to-head competition
with Microsoft's latest Windows NT, an advanced computer operating system
that represents Microsoft's bid to expand beyond PCs.
As Novell and Microsoft's ambitions increasingly overlap, the potential for
conflict increases. Yet Noorda insists he is not aiming to depose Microsoft
as the industry leader. 'Our motivation is not to own the industry, not to
be the biggest company necessarily, but to accelerate the growth of the
industry,' he says. 'That is our best chance for survival in this intensely
competitive business.'
It is this competitive challenge that seems to motivate Noorda. He has no
plans to retire, he says, although he plans to name his successor at Novell
later this year. 'I'll expire before I retire,' he quips. 'I hope to
continue to be involved with Novell for a long time.' And for that long
Microsoft is likely to feel the heat.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Reality dawns in Palestine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDERS HAVE been urging Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
to recognise each other and allow the establishment of an autonomous
Palestinian entity alongside the Jewish state for so long that the reaction
to news that they have done so can only be immense relief. The question is
whether the Israel-PLO recognition deal finalised yesterday and the
self-rule agreement to be signed on Monday have come in time to pave the way
for a comprehensive peace, or whether they are too late to do more than
demonstrate how intractable the Middle East conflict has become.
For more than a century, competition between Arab and Jew for the land of
Palestine has poisoned the politics of the region. With the establishment of
Israel and dispossession of many of Palestine's Arab inhabitants in 1948,
followed by Israel's conquest of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza
Strip from Egypt in 1967, the competition took on the air of a zero sum game
in which each side could only assert its own right to exist at the expense
of the other's.
Short of a territorial and national compromise, or of a war in which the
Arabs prevailed, the conflict could only end in the expulsion of all
Palestine's remaining Arab inhabitants. Given that these include a
significant number of Israeli citizens, the result would have been to
destroy the legitimacy of Israel itself.
Enormous credit
To his enormous credit, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has
decided to set aside his domestic opponents' territorial ideology, confront
his countrymen's fears and accept these realities. The deals he has
concluded with the PLO's Mr Yassir Arafat - the latter admittedly
negotiating from extreme weakness - should enable most Palestinians in the
territories to rule their own affairs and improve their economic conditions
while preserving Israel's essential security requirements. It outlines the
only conceivable settlement to the core issue of a conflict that has in the
past led the world to the brink of thermonuclear war and, unresolved, could
do so again.
That, in essence, is why the west and the other regional powers have a vital
interest in helping make this agreement work. It is easy to think of ways in
which it might not. Many details of the self-rule accord have still to be
negotiated, including highly sensitive questions concerning the relationship
between Israeli security forces defending Jewish settlers in the territories
and a yet-to-be-formed Palestinian police force. The PLO could split, thus
eroding its leader's already shaky authority. The Palestinians themselves
could descend into internecine strife, eventually prompting the return of
the occupiers to areas from which they have withdrawn. Mr Arafat, used to
strutting the international diplomatic stage and manoeuvring through the
minefields of Arab politics, may prove incompetent in the more mundane tasks
of municipal administration and undemocratic in his approach to a people
that has never directly elected him to any office.
Grassroots frictions
Beyond the sensitivity with which the two sides handle the inevitable
grassroots frictions, much will depend on the policies adopted by the new
Palestinian authority, and on the Israeli government's response. Separation
of the Palestinian entity from the Jewish state can only be a gradual and
partial affair; tens of thousands of Palestinians will continue to work in
Israel; and it is vital to the viability of the Palestinian proto-state that
it obtain the freest of trading arrangements with both Israel and Jordan.
Given those essential prerequisites, aid money from the west and from the
wealthy Gulf states will be well spent in seeking to effect a rapid
improvement in the Palestinian economy, underpinned by a well-focused
programme of public works - preferably under the auspices of the World Bank.
Without such an improvement in infrastructure and living conditions,
accompanied within months by democratic elections, paper commitments by
Israel and the PLO will be worthless, hoped-for investments by talented
Palestinian businessmen will fail to materialise, and militancy of all
kinds, including the Islamic variety, will proliferate. From now on, the
choices do not get any easier. But at least they are concerned with concrete
realities rather than conflicting aspirations.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Cheap thrills are not enough: Britain may be turning into a
bargain basement but consumers want quality and convenience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, it was newspapers, as The Times reduced its price from 45p to
30p. On Tuesday, it was credit cards, as Save &amp; Prosper launched a Visa card
with an interest rate 7 percentage points lower than most of its rivals. On
the same day, Mercury offered free evening and weekend calls in London on
its new mobile phone network.
Before that, there was the holiday price war, the lager price war, and last
year the DIY price war. Britain, it seems, has become a bargain basement.
Consumers already used to hearing that the UK is emerging from recession may
wonder why there should be so much price-cutting activity now. Are
businesses positioning themselves to increase market share as the recovery
gathers strength? Or do cuts reflect the continuing squeeze on
profitability? Will consumers, who rebounded quickly from the 1980s
recession, emerge more cautiously from the 1990s slowdown, forcing
manufacturers and retailers to compete fiercely on price for the rest of the
decade?
The picture is mixed, and companies are introducing cuts from a variety of
motives. An important priority for some is to defend market share in the
face of a rush of competition. The UK's largest superstore chains, for
example, are being confronted by rapidly expanding discount stores, which
sell a limited range of goods at very low prices in no-frills surroundings.
The big chains are responding by localised price-cutting, and introducing
new, lower-price products. Usually these are so-called 'tertiary brands',
cheaper and lesser-known alternatives to big-name and stores' own brands.
The chains are also making increasing use of 'multi-buy' promotions, such as
three for the price of two.
A recent price survey by Verdict, the retail market research group, found
that for a basket of 40 common groceries, taking the cheapest item, in each
case, the price had fallen by 8 per cent across 12 national grocery chains
since last September. The price gap between superstores and discounters had
closed to 6 per cent from 12 per cent.
Increasing sales of retailers' own-label and other cheaper brands has put
pressure on many well-known manufacturers' brands, which normally sell for
substantial premiums. On April 2, Philip Morris slashed the US price of its
cigarettes to defend the falling market share of its premium Marlboro brand.
Other US brand leaders, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft and Quaker Oats,
have had to cut prices or at least shelve planned increases.
Although no UK branded producer has been obliged to cut prices as deeply as
Marlboro, prices have recently come under attack in a different way - from
imports.
Tesco obtained supplies of Stella Artois, the Belgian premium lager, through
its French subsidiary Catteau instead of through Whitbread, which brews the
lager under licence in the UK, and which has established it as a premium
brand by marketing it as 'reassuringly expensive'. This allowed Tesco to
sell the lager 25 per cent more cheaply than when it was sourced from the
UK.
Whitbread has since agreed to supply Stella to Tesco in continental-style
packaging, although at the same price as before.
Observers, however, believe Whitbread, as well as Courage, which brews
Holsten under licence, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, licensee for Becks, may be
forced to cut prices as Tesco and J Sainsbury plan further promotions of
imported continental lagers.
Many consumers are voting with their feet and shopping for beer and wines in
continental Europe, where prices are lower since import restrictions have
been relaxed.
So, while some companies have been forced to cut prices to compete, others
have chosen to do so to try to win market share, or to establish themselves
in a new market.
The price cuts by The Times this week and by The Sun in July were both
gambles designed to arrest declining circulations and increase market share.
The Sun is said to have increased its circulation by about 300,000 as a
result - but most observers believe this is not enough to cover the lost
revenue.
The reduction at The Times, considered by many a premium product, was more
controversial. Initial reports are that it has boosted circulation by more
than 30 per cent, taking it above 400,000, but some industry commentators
fear it has damaged its image. The publicity surrounding both price cuts,
however, seems to have stimulated the market, with competitors also showing
increased sales.
The move this week by Save &amp; Prosper, which announced a steep drop in the
rate of interest on a new Visa credit card, was a similar attempt to win
market share - but by a minnow rather than a big fish.
S&amp;P has 100,000 cards in issue against Barclay's 8.8m and National
Westminster bank's 4m and does not disguise its motive of gaining a larger
share of the market by doubling the number of its cardholders. 'We think
competition for lending will increase and thought it better to move in
early,' said S&amp;P.
New entrants to markets will often undercut their competitors to establish
themselves. Mercury, which launched its One-2-One mobile phone service in
the London area this week, did that. One-2-One is offering free local calls
to customers in the evenings and at weekends, in a bid to open the consumer
market to mobile phones for the first time.
Price-cutting campaigns, where several companies compete, can 'kickstart' a
slow market. The recent holiday price war is a good example.
Thomas Cook's 10 per cent price cut last month was matched by competitors
such as Lunn Poly, Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson. The chains say the
discounts have given them their best start to summer bookings ever. Lunn
Poly says it has sold more than 300,000 summer 1994 holidays so far, 150 per
cent more than at the same time last year.
But the low-margin structure of the industry means a 10 per cent cut across
the board is unsustainable in the long term (it represents most of the
commission that travel agents receive from tour operators) and the
promotions end today.
While sporadic discounting to protect or enhance market share has been
common during the recession, there is a growing view that retailers, in
particular, will have to become increasingly price-orientated during the
1990s.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of the Kingfisher group, has warned that
consumers are demanding more convenience, wider ranges and improved service
 -all at lower prices. The result is that profit margins will fall.
Successful companies must get into the 'virtuous circle' of cutting gross
margins and prices, thus increasing volumes and market share, and then using
higher profits to drive down prices still further.
Sir Geoffrey is trying to steer the Kingfisher group in this direction. B&amp;Q,
Kingfisher's DIY chain, has moved away from sporadic deep discounting which
provoked a DIY price war last year. Instead, it has adopted a policy of
'everyday low prices', permanently reducing the cost of 500 product lines.
Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is also taking a
longer-term view. Last autumn it launched an 'outstanding value' campaign
which involved freezing the price of three-quarters of its clothing range
and reducing the price of the remaining 25 per cent. The company says it is
committed to using productivity improvements to hold prices down.
There are several factors supporting Sir Geoffrey's forecast that price
competition will be more savage in the 1990s than in the 1980s.
Even when the UK emerges fully from recession, the consensus is that
consumer spending will grow at only about 2 per cent a year, compared with
the 7 per cent it touched in the late 1980s.
Moreover, demographic changes will affect spending patterns, with the number
of consumers in the high-spending 15-34 age group forecast to drop by about
1m during the decade, while the number in the more thrifty 35-59 group
increases by more than 2m.
Virtually all new retailers arriving in the UK are discounters. These
include warehouse clubs, which sell a range of goods from corn flakes to car
tyres at bargain prices in enormous sheds; 'category killers' - such as Toys
R Us, Ikea and PC World - highly efficient superstores which sell a wide
range of goods within a particular market segment at discount prices; and
factory outlet malls, which gather together clearance outlets selling
factory surplus or end-of-line stocks.
Many retail observers believe these formats will find a ready audience among
consumers who have just lived through the worst recession since the second
world war and have grown more price sensitive.
The view that customers are motivated by price above all is not, however,
entirely borne out by research. Mr Jef Harris, chairman of market research
group Harris International Marketing, says that of the 50,000 grocery
shoppers it interviews each year, only 20 per cent rate price the most
important factor when deciding where to shop. About 70 per cent say
convenience is most important (the proportions have reversed since the late
1970s and early 1980s).
Only 30 per cent believe the supermarket or superstore where they shop is
actually the cheapest available to them. That means 70 per cent of customers
choose shops which they believe are not the cheapest, because other
considerations are more important.
That view is backed by research by the Henley Centre, which has found low
prices alone are far from being the main factor influencing consumers.
Both research groups agree that as more women work full-time, and as real
incomes continue to rise and retail spending as a proportion of income
falls, customers will be increasingly motivated by convenience, by the
desire to save time, and by better value for money.
Mr Eric Salama, joint managing director of the Henley Centre, told a
retailing conference earlier this year: 'The link between price and quality
is breaking down. Customers are beginning to expect that they can get higher
quality goods without necessarily paying for them.'
For 1990s consumers, therefore, simply cutting prices is not enough.
Shoppers are not concerned just with buying the cheapest - they want
good-quality products, but at competitive prices and accompanied by good
customer service. That is the real challenge for manufacturers and
retailers.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Hedging his fiscal bets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over the contents of the forthcoming November Budget will, it
seems, be an open and shut affair. Open, in the sense that the war of words
over taxing and spending is now seriously under way between embattled
factions within the Conservative party; closed, in that Mr Kenneth Clarke
has issued a characteristically blunt reminder that he is in charge and that
there is no question of him signing away in advance his right to increase
taxes, whatever the Tory right might care to hope.
Many of the right-wing persuasion appear anyway to be in a state of
intellectual confusion. Some claim to believe that theirs is the party of
low taxation and that an outsize public sector borrowing requirement will
disappear with economic recovery. This would serve remarkably well as the
working definition of a party of unsound finance. And, indeed, it could
readily be argued that this is precisely what the Tory party has been for
the past 14 years. The figures in the last Budget Red Book show that only
now, after a soaraway decade in the 1980s, are total taxes coming back down,
as a percentage of GDP, to the level inherited from Labour in 1979.
Fiscal softy
As for spending, the present economic recovery has been pump primed by a
substantial fiscal boost in which spending departments have been held on a
much looser rein than they had earlier dared hope. Meantime a former special
adviser to ex-chancellor Norman Lamont has been complaining bitterly this
week that the Tories are now the party of high spending and that Mr Michael
Portillo, the Treasury minister who threatens swingeing cuts, is talking
through his hat. This view derives further support from Mr Clarke's own
statements, on becoming chancellor, that it was politically unrealistic to
expect to make real cuts in public expenditure. A self-styled man of the
hard centre, he threatens on this score to become a fiscal softy in the
departmental lion's den.
That said, he has yet to reveal his hand on anything substantive. And what,
one wonders, could any chancellor be expected to do other than to keep his
options open in present circumstances. In the short run, Mr Clarke has been
the beneficiary of a bigger than expected rise in output thanks largely to a
return of consumer confidence. Inflation figures continue to undershoot
mainstream forecasts and unemployment has fallen surprisingly early in the
recovery. Yet the very fact that the economy continues to surprise the
analysts underlines the Treasury's diagnostic problems.
Savings rate
Savings behaviour, which is the key to a significant part of the recovery to
date, is particularly hard to pin down. After a big surge, which provided
the main impetus to recession, the rate of household saving started to fall
again last year. But with the personal sector still heavily indebted after
the housing boom of the late 1980s, no one can predict how far and fast the
rate will now come down; nor, again, whether the confidence boost from
falling unemployment off-sets the restraining influence of housing market
debt.
In the meantime there are difficult questions about the external account,
which are exacerbated by the interruption in the official trade data.
Sterling devaluation has enhanced competitiveness; and productivity growth,
which is traditionally rapid in the early stages of recovery, is now working
further magic on unit labour costs. But some of the shine comes off gains in
competitiveness when Britain's main trading partners in continental Europe
appear bent on putting off recovery - witness the reluctance of the French
to cut their intervention rate after the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts on
Thursday.
Sheer ignorance of how the economy works, together with the fallibility of
the Treasury's own past forecasts, provides a compelling reason for delaying
the decision on taxation. And even if the data were reliable that judgment
would be horrifically difficult, since Mr Clarke has to steer a course
between a rate of growth that is neither so slow that the public finances
remain under pressure, nor so fast that the trade account collapses further.
Much easier, in fact, to run the economy from the backbenches. The Tory
right should count its blessings.

DR GERALD Smith, chief executive of Farr Group, a building group, stole
Pounds 2m from its pension fund to pay company debts, Southwark Crown Court
heard yesterday.
Dr Smith forged an authority to liquidate assets of the Farr Group pension

THE UK and Irish governments yesterday re-affirmed their commitment to
resuming inter-party dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland, Alison
Smith writes.
A joint statement after a three-hour meeting of the Anglo-Irish
inter-governmental conference in London said that the two administrations
'underlined the urgency and importance of the search for political
agreement'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, admitted that there had
been little progress in breaking the stalemate that ended the talks late
last year, but insisted there were grounds for encouragement in contacts
that had been maintained with political parties in Northern Ireland over the
past few months.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, emphasised that both governments
saw the resumption of talks as the priority.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Grassroots Tory activists signal discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCONTENT AMONG Tory grassroots activists at the government's policies on
value added tax, defence cuts and law and order has been pressed home to the
party leadership in the motions presented for the annual conference.
The 1,200 motions submitted by constituency parties, published yesterday,
reveal deep concern about the impact of the Budget decision to impose VAT on
domestic fuel.
Almost 150 of the motions concern the economy, and one in five of these
either calls for the reversal of the VAT extension or expresses reservations
about it.
The motion from Wirral West - the constituency of Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary - was among the most outspoken, saying that the move was 'totally
incompatible' with the principles of fairness laid out in the Citizen's
Charter.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, appeared to draw comfort from the fact
that many of the motions on the economy called for action to be taken to
reduce the PSBR.
But the range of opinions expressed, from calls for an income tax increase
to vigorous opposition to such a move, is a further reminder of the rift in
the party over tackling government borrowing.
There is a striking degree of consensus, however, among the motions on
defence, almost all of which demand a reversal of the reductions in defence
spending or a halt to further cuts.
There was a call for caution over the impact of cutting the armed services,
including one from the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency of Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary. Although more coded in its terms than others, it
urges that any restructuring of the services should allow them to meet
current and possible future commitments.
The largest number of motions on a single topic is the 244 on law and order,
which the government has already said will be one of its main themes in the
coming months.
Only about a dozen, uncontroversial motions will be selected for debate at
the conference in early October.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said last night: 'The Conservative
motions demonstrate that the party is now divided from top to bottom over
the imposition of VAT on fuel bills after Labour's successful campaign
opposing it.
'The prime minister should now overrule the Chancellor and order a rethink
of VAT on fuel.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Lathe-maker hopeful in 'lousy market': Business reports
sluggish Continental sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR YEARS ago Colchester Lathe unveiled a range of products at EMO, the
world's largest machine-tool show, and sold 500 machines straight off the
stand. 'It was the best show we have ever had,' recalled Mr Tony Sweeten.
Next week, as this year's show opens in a very different business climate,
there will be more new products on the Colchester stand at Hanover, Germany,
but it will be a miracle if anything like that number are sold.
Colchester lathes and those of its sister company TS Harrison are made by
600 Lathes, in the 600 Group's machine-tool division, of which Mr Sweeten is
managing director.
He said 600 Lathes' sales in continental Europe had fallen by 50 per cent in
the past 18 months. 'Germany is the industrial powerhouse of Europe and the
recession there affects everywhere else.' But Mr Sweeten is not
down-hearted: 'We've given a reasonable account of ourselves in a lousy
market,' he said. 'We've held our market shares, and even raised them in
some cases.'
Continental Europe accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the group's
lathe sales, and has long been an important market for Harrison and
Colchester.
They both produce mainly 'centre lathes' - manual machines to make turned
parts that are stalwarts of machines shops and toolrooms.
Mr Sweeten said Harrison has been making metric machines for the European
market since 1972. The more upmarket Colchester has been particularly
successful in Germany, helped by good marketing and a high-tech product.
Mr Sweeten said the German market first started to decline 18 months ago,
and went into a steep fall a year ago - just when the devaluation of
sterling against the D-Mark was transforming the terms of trade for UK
exporters to Germany, at least in theory.
But its machine-tool market is running at less than 50 per cent of its
levels 18 months ago. The decline in German sales has more than offset the
benefits of devaluation.
It is not all gloom, however. German competitors had higher costs and found
it harder to cut them, Mr Sweeten said. In contrast, the 600 Group moved
quickly in 1991 to concentrate all its lathe manufacturing at one plant in
West Yorkshire. And for the business that remained in Germany, the UK group
could offer better technology than its competitors for the same price or
less.
So Mr Sweeten believes the lathe business will have improved its competitive
position when the Continent emerges from recession.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Boat-builder looks to show for health of economy: Business
reports sluggish Continental sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of inquiries this weekend at the Southampton International Boat
Show should provide Fairline, one of the UK's leading boat manufacturers,
with some idea of whether the economy is looking up.
The week-long show attracts some foreign buyers but is mainly for UK
enthusiasts. It is the German shows - starting with Friedrichshafen in three
weeks - which the company will watch with most interest.
In 1989 Fairline exported 40 per cent of its output. Now, said Mrs Briony
Newington, the marketing director, the figure was more than 80 per cent.
The company, based near Peterborough, makes about 300 powerboats a year,
compared with 500 in the late 1980s. But the boats it makes now tend to be
larger and more expensive, selling for about Pounds 750,000.
After recording a loss of Pounds 507,000 last year the company expects to be
profitable this year.
When the UK started to go into recession Fairline looked to the Continent
for salvation. Germany has held up well, in spite of its economic downturn.
The company has increased its market share in Spain, although selling
pleasure boats there has become more difficult. France is experiencing more
difficult conditions. Sales to Germany have climbed from 25 per cent to 40
per cent of turnover in the past few years.
Fairline's sales received a boost from last year's sterling devaluation and
the German downturn does not appear to have affected orders.
'When they talk recession in Germany it's not the same as when they talk
recession in the UK,' said Mrs Newington. But France, she said, appeared to
be experiencing a UK-style downturn. 'They seem to be in the position we
were in a year ago.'
Mrs Newington said, however, that she has found Fairline's Continental
distributors reasonably optimistic. She hoped this week's interest-rate cuts
in continental Europe would keep orders buoyant.
UK boat-builders were in a strong position to turn their attention to
exports, she said. They were larger than their Continental rivals and could
manufacture more efficiently.
Mrs Newington said that UK boats had always been admired for their
mechanical excellence. The big improvement recently was their design.
With Europe in difficulties, the company is looking to the Far East, where
new marinas should boost demand.

MERCEDES-BENZ this week asked the Department of Trade and Industry for
details of UK sites of about 250 to 300 acres which would be suitable for
consideration for their proposed new assembly plant.
The DTI contacted UK inward investment agencies asking for site details.
Among those approached was the Northern Development Company, covering
north-east England and Cumbria, which has sent the DTI site details.
However, attention also focused yesterday on the West Midlands, where
component suppliers GKN, T&amp;N and Triplex Lloyd already manufacture parts for
Mercedes.
Industry analysts said the proximity of component suppliers will play a
leading role in the decision over where to site a plant.
The Black Country Development Corporation, which covers the region where
many component manufacturers are based, said the 'just in time' production
system of companies such as Mercedes meant new plants had to be close to
parts suppliers.
'The West Midlands would be an obvious choice because of the car component
manufacturing and infrastructure already here,' the development corporation
said yester-day.
The decision by Toyota, the Japanese manufacturer, to open its main European
plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, could also influence Mercedes, according to
local development officials.
The Northern Development Corporation, aware of the potential competition, is
trying to take matters beyond the DTI inquiry about possible sites.
The NDC happens to be holding a seminar for the German automotive industry
at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday. Mr Bridge is hopeful Mercedes-Benz
will be attending.
The NDC believes the success of Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, which
has attracted automotive suppliers to the area, is a valuable plus in wooing
Mercedes-Benz.
'I'd argue that the north of England has got the most successful automotive
and component activity in the UK, on the basis of growth and output through
the Nissan plant and the quality of the supply chain,' said Mr Bridge.
'That success derives largely from its newness. It doesn't have the problems
inherent in other parts of the country.'
He did not think the presence of a large carmaker like Nissan, now employing
4,600 people at Sunderland, could act as a disincentive by arousing fears
suitable labour might have been already mopped up.
Nissan said: 'Our investment in the north-east has proved very, very
successful in establishing the most productive car plant in Europe and one
capable of producing cars to Japanese quality standards.'
Mercedes-Benz's project could qualify for substantial grants and subsidies
depending on the site chosen, even though automatic grants under regional
policy were ended in the mid-1980s.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Market downturn hits meat exporter: Business reports
sluggish Continental sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN ABOUT Mr David Maunder's meat business disturbs his sleep. After
recently investing millions of pounds to bring his abattoir up to EC
standards, he now faces over-capacity in the UK market for the lamb he sells
and declining export sales as Europe pitches into recession.
'I am faced with it the whole of my waking life and it wakes me up in the
night too,' said Mr Maunder, director of Lloyd Maunder, one of the UK's
larger exporters of lamb carcasses.
Mr Maunder said that after enjoying a boost from the devaluation of sterling
last September his export business had seen a downturn since the start of
the year.
Last year Lloyd Maunder sold about 630,000 tonnes of lamb, with about 60 per
cent of that going for export, but export sales are expected to be lower
this year.
He added: 'Margins have been eroded because of competition in France and
Germany, and the Spanish market is not looking as good as last year  - all
of these markets are being squeezed by recessionary pressures.'
Spain's market for UK lamb represents a niche that some companies such as Mr
Maunder's have established over the past eight years. Spanish buyers want
lighter lamb carcasses than are sold in the UK from August to January, when
domestic supplies are low.
But sales to Spain over the past month have been running a third lower than
last year as the recession bites. The company is also facing increased
competition from newcomers to the export market which are turning to Spain
and undercutting prices as competition in the UK intensifies.
Competition in the French market, particularly from Irish producers, has cut
margins to a level that is making it harder to cover overheads. Mr Maunder
said: 'If margins continue to be eroded like this, it will be extremely hard
for us to make a profit this year.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / TUC moderniser strives for new horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MONKS can have no illusions about the magnitude of his task
regenerating British trade unionism after more than a decade of decline. His
first testing week compelled him to address two audiences.
In his inaugural speech as TUC general secretary on Wednesday he made a calm
and reasoned appeal to the world beyond the conference hall.
Here he appeared as the moderniser and competent manager, keen to show by
his commonsense and efficiency that the TUC still has an important role to
play.
Ready to adapt to change, he assured his audience that his personal ambition
was to lead 'a united TUC into the 21st century, spanning new horizons yet
committed still to the enduring values of solidarity, unity and justice'.
His speech may have lacked punch in its delivery but its content suggested
that Mr Monks may turn out to be the most far-sighted reformer the TUC has
seen since the era of George Woodcock more than 30 years ago.
But then on Thursday we saw a different Mr Monks in action. Union leaders
turned congress into what Mr Monks described as 'a bear hall' as they tore
each other to bits over the electricians' return, after a six-year absence,
to the TUC as a section of the recently merged AEEU engineering and
electrical union. The sheer strength of feeling took many by surprise.
The Berlin Wall may have fallen, the Soviet Union is dead, but the TUC is
still convulsed by events at Mr Rupert Murdoch's print plant at Wapping more
than seven years ago when members of the then EETPU electricians' union took
printworkers' jobs during the bitter dispute.
The hard left was displeased by Mr Monks' reaction to this particular
inter-union war. One journal yesterday said: 'His first task under fire
found him deploying the tactic of last resort. By making support for the
general council retreat an issue of personal confidence he devalued his
office.'
In fact, the new TUC general secretary showed a steely courage under
pressure that we have not seen in congress for a long time. His unprepared
response was coherent and devastating. But then for more than 20 years he
has been mediating between the warring factions behind the scenes at TUC
headquarters.
Mr Monks may have failed to achieve a final settlement over the return of
the electricians but he did enough to show he has no intention of dodging
hard questions.
Thursday's debate suggests that too many union leaders want to settle old
scores and ignore what is going on in the world beyond their own shrinking
memberships.
The row over the electricians was the only issue in the week at congress to
clear the bars and fill the hall with fury. More important debates - on the
future of labour law and how unions should respond to their decreasing
memberships - provoked little interest. Few delegates showed much interest
in new ideas. Human resource management was denounced. Performance-related
pay found no friends.
It was the marginalised Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM
mineworkers' union, who stirred emotions with his advocacy of struggle.
But Mr Monks knows well enough that if he is forced to devote his skills and
energy in trying to prevent further civil wars between the unions, he will
fail as a moderniser.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, was yesterday
elected as TUC president for the next 12 months.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Colchester Lathe hopes for German recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR YEARS ago Colchester Lathe unveiled a range of products at EMO, the
world's largest machine tool show, and sold 500 machines straight off the
stand. 'It was the best show we have ever had,' recalled Mr Tony Sweeten.
Next week, as the 1993 show opens in a very different business climate,
there will be more new products on the Colchester stand at Hanover. But it
would be a miracle if anything like that number were sold.
Colchester lathes and those of its sister company TS Harrison are made by
600 Lathes, flagship of the 600 Group's machine tool division, of which Mr
Sweeten is managing director.
Over the last 18 months, he said, 600 Lathes' sales in continental Europe
have fallen by 50 per cent. 'Germany is the industrial powerhouse of Europe
and the recession there affects everywhere else,' he said.
But Mr Sweeten is not down-hearted: 'We've given a reasonable account of
ourselves in a lousy market,' he said. 'We've held our market shares, and
even raised them in some cases.'
Continental Europe accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the group's
lathe sales, and has long been an important market for Harrison and
Colchester.
They both produce mainly 'centre lathes' - manual machines to make turned
parts that are stalwarts of machines shops and toolrooms.
Mr Sweeten said Harrison has been making metric machines for the European
market since 1972. The more up-market Colchester has been particularly
successful in Germany, helped by good marketing and a high-tech product.
Mr Sweeten said the German market first started to decline 18 months ago,
and went into a steep fall a year ago - just when the devaluation of
sterling against the D-Mark was transforming the terms of trade for UK
exporters to Germany, at least in theory.
The sharp decline in Germany in the last three months of 1992 reflected a
crisis of confidence throughout German industry. Many customers slashed
capital spending and simply stopped buying machine tools.
Sales in Germany had continued to fall, Mr Sweeten said. He expects the
decline will continue until the end of the year. Germany, Europe's largest
machine tool market, accounts for about half of 600 Lathes' European
exports.
But its machine tool market is running at less than 50 per cent of its
levels 18 months ago. The decline in German sales has more than offset the
benefits of devaluation.
It is not all gloom, however. German competitors had higher costs and found
it harder to cut them, Mr Sweeten said. In contrast, the 600 Group moved
quickly in 1991 to concentrate all its lathe manufacturing at one plant in
West Yorkshire. And for the business that remained in Germany, the UK group
could offer better technology than its competitors for the same, or a lower,
price.
So Mr Sweeten believes the lathe business will have improved its competitive
position when the continent emerges from recession.

that Mr Monks may turn out to be the most far-sighted reformer the TUC has
seen since the era of George Woodcock more than 30 years ago.
But then on Thursday we saw a different Mr Monks in action. In a debate
looking back to the past union leaders turned congress into, in Mr Monk's
words, 'a bear hall' as they tore each other to bits over the return of the
maverick electricians to the 'TUC family'. The strength of feeling the
prospect aroused took many by surprise.
The Berlin Wall may have fallen, Soviet communism is dead, but the TUC is
still convulsed by what the electricians' union did at Rupert Murdoch's
Wapping printing plant more than seven years ago.
The hard left was displeased by Mr Monks' reaction to this particular
inter-union war.
'It is a disastrous start,' said the Communist Trade Unionists broadsheet
yesterday. 'His first task under fire found him deploying the tactic of last
resort. By making support for the general council retreat an issue of
personal confidence he devalued his office.'
In fact, the new TUC general secretary showed a steely courage under
pressure that we have not seen in congress for a long time. His unprepared
response was coherent and devastating. But then for more than 20 years he
has been mediating between the warring factions behind the scenes at TUC
headquarters.
In the past few weeks Mr Monks has had to devote hours of his time to smooth
the return of the electricians as the issue threatened to cloud his own
election. He may have failed to achieve a final settlement but he did enough
to show he has no intention of dodging hard questions.
The danger is that Mr Monks will find himself too often having to turn
inwards to prevent further outbursts of inter-union rivalry.
Thursday's debate suggests that too many union leaders want to settle old
scores and ignore what is going on in the world beyond their own shrinking
memberships.
The row over the electricians was the only issue in the week at congress to
clear the bars and fill the hall with fury. More important debates - on the
future of labour law and how unions should respond to their decreasing
memberships - provoked little of interest. Few delegates showed much
interest in new ideas. Human resource management was denounced.
Performance-related pay found no friends.
It was the marginalised mineworkers' union president Arthur Scargill who
stirred the emotions of congress with his advocacy of struggle.
But Mr Monks knows well enough that if he is forced to devote his skills and
energy in trying to prevent further civil wars between the unions, he will
fail as a moderniser. 'If we allow ourselves to be riven by union rivalry
there is little we can achieve,' he warned.
In November the TUC general council meets for a two-day conference to
reassess the future of trade unionism. This will be followed by what Mr
Monks calls a 'relaunch' of the TUC.
As delegates left Brighton yesterday, however, it was unclear whether the
competent and highly intelligent new general secretary will be able to
present an acceptable face of British trade unionism to a world where two in
every three workers is no longer organised.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, 52-year-old general secretary of transport union RMT, was
elected yesterday TUC president for the next twelve months.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Two more gas-fired stations go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM Eggar, energy minister, yesterday gave the go-ahead for two more
gas-fired power stations, David Lascelles writes.
They are a 1,200MW combined cycle gas turbine plant at Seabank, Avon, and a
similar 710MW station at Keadby on Humberside.
The Seabank station is being built by Midlands Electricity and British Gas,
and Keadby by Hydro-Electric and Northern Electric.
The gas-fired power station at Seabank on the Severn estuary is expected to
cost Pounds 500m and will be owned and operated by Seabank Power, a joint
venture between British Gas and Midlands Electricity.
The stations are the latest in the controversial 'dash for gas' which has
been blamed for causing the contraction of the coal industry.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Competitiveness helps to narrow trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPROVED competitiveness of UK goods, following the devaluation of
sterling a year ago, helped narrow the trade gap in the second quarter.
World trade figures show that in the three months to June the UK imported
Pounds 3.3bn more than it exported, a slightly narrower deficit than in the
previous quarter when the gap was Pounds 3.5bn, revised from Pounds 4.5bn.
Although the quarterly deficit remains high, the latest figures contain
encouraging trends. Measured by volume, imports have fallen sharply since
the start of the year, while export volumes remained about flat.
This raises the possibility that the UK is substituting goods made
domestically for foreign imports. It also reflects the continued weakness of
domestic demand which has limited import penetration.
The news is encouraging because it suggests the economic recovery will be
able to progress without a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments.
The volume of total imports excluding oil and erratic items - defined as
ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver - fell by 3 per cent in the
latest quarter, compared with a 5 per cent fall in the first quarter.
On the same basis, exports rose by 1 per cent in the second quarter,
following a 3 per cent decline in the first.
The Central Statistical Office has yet to provide a breakdown of imports and
exports by commodity, so it is not clear where import substitution is taking
place.
While the figures are encouraging, the improvement in UK trade has been
confined to countries outside the European Community, which account for less
than half of total UK trade.
The visible trade deficit with the EC doubled from Pounds 400m in the first
three months of the year to Pounds 800m in the second quarter, reflecting
the economic sluggishness afflicting the UK's European trading partners.
By contrast, the deficit with non-EC countries narrowed. It was Pounds
2.36bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.1bn in the first.
The figures showed a sharp fall in the terms of trade in the second quarter,
resulting from a 2.5 per cent fall in export prices and a 0.5 per cent
increase in import prices. Non-oil export prices were 7.25 per cent higher
compared with a year ago, while comparable import prices rose by 13.25 per
cent.
The CSO warned that the introduction of a new method of data collection for
intra-EC trade meant that the latest figures were more than usually liable
to revision.
The latest figures refer only to visible, or merchandise, trade. Estimates
for invisible trade flows - services, government transfer payments and
earnings on overseas investments - appear later this month.

FT  11 SEP 93 / UK and Irish governments re-affirm commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and Irish governments yesterday re-affirmed their commitment to
resuming inter-party dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland, Alison
Smith writes.
A joint statement after a three-hour meeting of the Anglo-Irish
intergovernmental conference in London said that the two administrations
'underlined the urgency and importance of the search for political
agreement'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, admitted that there had
been little progress in breaking the stalemate that ended the talks late
last year, but insisted there were grounds for encouragement in contacts
that had been maintained with political parties in Northern Ireland over the
past few months.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, emphasised that both governments saw
the resumption of talks as the priority, refusing to be drawn on Irish
interest in the possible appointment of a US 'peace envoy' in Belfast.
Mr Michael Ancram, a Northern Ireland minister, said that all sides agreed
that a political settlement had to be reached. He will be pursuing private
discussions with the Northern Ireland parties to try to find a way forward
for the talks.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Roxburghe loses fight to save banking licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England has won its fight to revoke the licence of Roxburghe
Bank, the Asian bank that went into administration in April.
The decision follows an appeal against the Bank's petition brought by the
shareholders of Roxburghe, who initially demanded that the case be reviewed
by the banking appeals tribunal.
After initial discussions they agreed in the last few weeks not to proceed
with the appeal, the costs of which might have been charged to Roxburghe if
they had lost.
The details are revealed in a letter to be sent to the bank's 1,300
creditors early next week by Mr Tony Lomas and Mr Colin Bird, the joint
administrators from accountants Price Waterhouse.
Removing Roxburghe's authorisation to operate as a bank means that it has no
prospect of emerging from administration procedure to trade as a bank in the
future.
It also means that if the company is to continue to trade in some other
form, it will have to change its name in the next few months to remove the
word 'bank' from the title.
Mr J H Shah and Mr R H Shah, two directors, are believed to be considering
continuing their fight against aspects of the Bank of England's petition.
The Bank petitioned for Roxburghe's administration after monitoring its
position for some months.
The administrators said much of Roxburghe's business was with relatively
high-risk borrowers. Most of the depositors were from overseas,
predominantly based in India and Kenya, and many held deposits for
relatively small amounts.
They estimate that Roxburghe has assets of about Pounds 34m and liabilities
of Pounds 32m after provisions. Further provisions may give it negative net
worth of up to Pounds 5m, reducing the dividend to creditors below 100 per
cent.
Roxburghe is the fourth bank serving the Asian community in the UK to have
been affected since the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International in 1991.
Mount Banking, which recently made a voluntary arrangement with its
creditors, is currently appealing against the Bank of England's petition for
withdrawal of its banking licence.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LONDON FORUM, the private-sector initiative launched earlier in the year to
promote London, will ask ministers next month to back efforts to promote
inward investment into the capital with government funds.
A feasibility study on the potential for a 'First-Stop Shop' has been
carried out for the City Corporation - the local authority for the City of
London, the capital's business district - by Jones Lang Wootton, the estate
agents.
This found that other European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris have
central organisations for promotion to inward investors, with budgets of
several million pounds a year.
Representatives of London Forum will meet Sir George Young, inner cities
minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to discuss funding a
First-Stop Shop which would provide a showcase for inward investors thinking
of locating in London. The shop would provide information about all aspects
of London, including office accommodation, transport and living conditions.
The post of chief executive is likely to be advertised soon.

<TEXT>
THE 16 MONTHS of negotiations culminating in yesterday's restructuring
proposals for Canary Wharf were among the most arduous and complex in any
insolvency to date.
Officials from central government, local authorities, the London Docklands
Development Corporation, London Regional Transport, the Docklands Light
Railway and existing tenants were involved in discussions co-ordinated by Mr
Nigel Hamilton, Mr Stephen Adamson and Mr Alan Bloom, the administrators
from accountants Ernst &amp; Young.
Mr Peter Totty, a partner at Allen &amp; Overy who drafted the voluntary
arrangement document circulated yesterday, said: 'The only case we've ever
had is that something is better than nothing.'
He said several important decisions were resolved only in the last few days,
including agreements by tenants not to sue and the agreement of Canadian
administrators. 'It's been quite a cliffhanger,' he said.
The collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the parent company, required negotiations to
reconcile English insolvency law with the equivalents in Canada and the US,
where the group had property develop-ments.
Lawyers and accountants have clocked up thousands of hours during the
process and are likely to receive more than Pounds 14m by the end of the
process - regardless of the eventual outcome.
'It has been a succession of meetings going on almost since day one,' said
Mr Hamilton. 'The biggest difficulty was recognising the aspirations of each
sub-group. We spent many long hours persuading, cajoling. We sat till 4am on
more occasions than I care to think about.'
Many of the most important negotiations took place between the dozen banks
supporting Canary Wharf in New York, Toronto, London and Luxembourg. They
came from different countries, with varying regulatory structures, tax
demands and requirements for provisions on losses.
Their loan exposures varied widely and each had bilateral loans with Olympia
&amp; York, rather than a single syndicated loan which would have made
co-ordination more simple.
Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank co-ordinated the bankers. He likened
discussions to pushing a jelly, and said he had held more than 40 meetings
with London Transport alone.
The bankers did not have things all their own way. The government refused to
allow them repayment of all the money they put up under the so-called
'drop-dead agreement' if the Jubilee line was not completed on time.
He said there had been no victory parties by those involved so far, but
added that if the agreement is approved after the end of next month: 'There
will no doubt be the odd celebration or two.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Canary Wharf deal 'breaks new ground'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TO Canary Wharf, the office project in London's Docklands that went
into administration last year, yesterday announced details of a complex
Pounds 1.1bn rescue package.
This is the first time that a company voluntary arrangement, by which
companies are taken out of administration as a going concern, has been used
for such a large company.
Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank said: 'In putting together a rescue package of
this size, we are breaking new ground.'
The secured lenders have agreed to restructure their existing debt of Pounds
568m, plus accruing interest over 14 years, deferring repayment of the loans
until 2007.
In addition, the lenders are putting up new finance of up to Pounds 278m.
This sum includes the initial Pounds 98m private-sector payment for the
Jubilee Line extension, which will be provided by the European Investment
Bank, which is owned by the European Community.
It also involves payment of Pounds 27m to the unsecured creditors under the
company voluntary arrangement and Pounds 153m to support the long-term
development of Canary Wharf.
A further Pounds 300m will be paid to London Regional Transport over 25
years for the completion of the Jubilee Line extension, which has a current
value of Pounds 80m.
The consortium of lenders to Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf are Barclays,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Chemical Bank, Citibank, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki,
Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Canada.
The company voluntary arrangements for five main Canary Wharf companies
involves paying the 1,400 unsecured creditors up to 15p in the pound. About
130 creditors will be required to give warranties and will receive a further
25p in the pound. The claims of unsecured creditors are expected to be
Pounds 117m to Pounds 149m.
The proposed restructuring, refinancing and arrangements for the Jubilee
Line extension contain complex conditions making the transactions dependent
on each other, so no part of the proposals will go through unless they all
do.
Mr Stephen Adamson of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the administrators, said: 'The
package is interlocking so unless all the agreements fall into place,
nothing will happen.'
The costs of Canary Wharf's administration have been between Pounds 13m and
Pounds 14m.
The administrators have called a meeting to vote on the company voluntary
arrangements on September 30. The company is expected to come out of
administration by October 31 if the arrangements are approved by more than
75 per cent of creditors by value.
Canary Wharf's corporate structure will be reorganised under a parent
company controlled by the banks.

FT  11 SEP 93 / London Forum seeks backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON FORUM, the private-sector initiative launched earlier in the year to
promote London, will ask ministers next month to back efforts to promote
inward investment into the capital with government funds.
A feasibility study on the potential for a 'First-Stop Shop' has been
carried out for the City Corporation - the local authority for the City of
London, the capital's business district - by Jones Lang Wootton, the estate
agents.
This found that other European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris have
central organisations for promotion to inward investors, with budgets of
several million pounds a year.
Representatives of London Forum will meet Sir George Young, inner cities
minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to discuss funding a
First-Stop Shop which would provide a showcase for inward investors thinking
of locating in London. The shop would provide information about all aspects
of London, including office accommodation, transport and living conditions.
The post of chief executive is likely to be advertised soon.
Later this month the Corporation of London and the London Docklands
Development Corporation will join forces for the first time in an effort to
attract inward investment from the Far East to London.
In the absence of a body to promote London abroad the two organisations have
taken a stand at the Hong Kong World Property Market exhibition at the end
of the month to set out the capital's attractions as a centre for business.
Other UK cities will be separately represented.
The City Corporation has promoted the First-Stop Shop concept with
Westminster City Council and the LDDC, the quango responsible for the
regeneration of a 22 sq km area of former docklands in East London.
There is a reservoir of unlet commercial property in the capital. The City
has 7m sq ft of empty office space, including Pounds 30m of properties owned
by the corporation which are on its sales list. There is 4.9m sq ft to let
in Docklands, including much of Canary Wharf, the prestige office
development which is in administration under insolvency procedures.
An early success in selling London abroad has come with the decision of the
Polish trade mission to locate its west European office in the City.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, said that he hoped other eastern bloc trade missions would follow
suit.
The Polish decision had been taken against competition from other European
cities, in particular Frankfurt.
Mr Cassidy said that while the terms had been keen, they were no different
from those applying to other commercial lettings.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Customs climbs down on VAT plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HM CUSTOMS and Excise has backed down over proposals which would have
prevented many holding companies from reclaiming value added tax.
The department had proposed in a consultation paper issued last October that
holding companies owning operating subsidiaries would no longer be entitled
to recover VAT incurred on 'basic business activities' such as fees paid to
professionals.
Customs yesterday abandoned this proposal saying that it now planned to make
only minor changes to the existing system from October this year.
The reversal follows intensive lobbying from businesses and professional
bodies.
The proposals were based on an interpretation of a ruling by the European
Court of Justice on a holding company called Polysar. Initially due to be
introduced in April, they were delayed until this October pending further
consultation.
Objections included representations from a Pounds 125,000 lobbying campaign
by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, paid for by 17 companies.
Customs stressed that there are still minor changes. Companies which are not
active trading companies, not grouped with active trading subsidiaries or
which do not provide genuine management services to trading subsidiaries
will not be able to claim VAT refunds.
Customs said: 'We are a fairly pragmatic department and don't want to put
extra burdens on business.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Inland Revenue says tax privacy will remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to contract out the operation of computers used for assessing income
and corporation tax will not threaten the confidentiality of personal or
commercially-sensitive information, the Inland Revenue said yesterday.
Information relating to the Queen and other members of the royal family is
unlikely to be processed by outside contractors. The tax affairs of MPs,
members of the security services and other politically sensitive individuals
will continue to be handled by a special high-security wing of a Cardiff tax
office.
Mr Steve Matheson, the Revenue's deputy chairman, described as
'disinformation' reports that tax information would be less secure.
All information processing would be carried out in the UK under security
requirements at least as strenuous as those now applying to the Inland
Revenue, he said. The Revenue would monitor the contracts to ensure
compliance with its requirements, with the right to carry out spot checks on
the processing centres.
Two bidders - both US-owned - are left on the shortlist for the contract,
which will be worth between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn over 10 years. One is
a consortium of International Business Machines UK and Computer Sciences
Corporation, Europe. The other is EDS-Scicon.
The winning bidder will take over more than 2,000 Inland Revenue information
technology staff. It will be responsible for managing the Revenue's computer
systems, which include 13 data centres, three development centres and 50,000
terminals in tax offices. It will also modernise and upgrade the systems in
partnership with the Revenue.
Civil servants will continue to be responsible for examining tax returns,
assessing liabilities and making any judgments that are necessary.
Individual tax returns and company files will not be handed over to the IT
contractor.
The IT centres will process tax data keyed in by the civil servants and
issue assessments, notices, tax demands and repayments.
Mr Matheson said that it would be impossible for employees of the contractor
to access the data or copy documents printed out without leaving clear
evidence of interference. The department already had complex procedures to
stop staff looking at the files of taxpayers and companies to which they
were not entitled to have access. The successful contractor would be
required to have procedures at least as rigorous.
All three companies left in the bidding had excellent track records in
handling confidential data, Mr Matheson said.

FT  11 SEP 93 / No end in sight to Japan's recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE monetary planners of the Bank of Japan's grey stone fortress in Tokyo's
business district now have all the evidence they could need to justify a
half-percentage point cut in official lending rates.
That was the message drawn yesterday by Tokyo economists from the central
bank's latest quarterly survey of corporate confidence, the first since the
formation of the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. It confirms
that Japan's powerful economic machine has remained in neutral over the
summer and shows no sign of engaging first gear for some time to come.
Japanese manufacturers' business confidence ebbed to its lowest in 18 years
between May and August this year and service industries' sentiment was at
its most pessimistic ever, the survey shows.
After stagnating at -49 for two quarters, ending in February and May, the
bank's Tankan index of manufacturers' business confidence dropped to -51 by
the end of last month, its lowest since 1975. Service industries' sentiment
slipped from -38 in May to -41 in August, a record low.
The central bank's Tankan survey of business confidence is seen as Japan's
most authoritative study of short-term business intentions and is used by
the bank in forming monetary policy.
The previous Tankan survey forecast a slight recovery, which appears to have
been stifled by the continued rise of the yen through August and the wettest
summer for years, which has restrained consumer spending.
'There are no signs of recovery,' says Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. 'It could be quite some time in coming, perhaps a
year away. Between now and then we are in for a continuation of a slow,
rolling recession.'
Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'It's a
little worse than we expected in terms of profits and sales outlook, a weak
labour market and an increase in inventories. . . this recession is showing
an extended bottom rather than a double dip. I don't think we will see an
upturn for at least two quarters.'
The manufacturing companies questioned said profits would fall by 10.7 per
cent this year, a steeper fall than forecast in the previous survey, while a
balance of 32 per cent had excess inventories, up 1 point on May and 26 per
cent had excess capacity, up 2 points.
On average, manufacturers plan to cut capital investment by 5.9 per cent in
the tax year ending next March, having forecast a smaller 4.4 per cent in
the last survey. The employment outlook is also weak, with a balance of 19
per cent of all companies believing their workforces are too large.
Less pessimistically, Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers,
believes a turnaround could come by the end of the year, as two government
spending packages, worth nearly Y24,000bn (Pounds 147bn) over the past 16
months, begin to feed through.
He, and others, believe government agencies have been slow to disburse that
cash because of bureaucrats' fear, in the wake of the scandals of the past
few years, of being arrested if they pass a construction contract to a
company with which they have connections.
In conditions like these it is no surprise that business lobbies have
recently been urging the central bank to cut the official discount rate by a
full percentage point or more from the 2.5 per cent at which it has held
since February.
But analysts believe that the bank, which has always been cautious about
changing interest rates, will hesitate to go that far and content itself
with a half-point cut some time this month.
'Lower interest rates improve conditions for capital investment, but are not
enough by themselves,' warns Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the bank's
research and statistics department. Only when business sentiment improves
will falling interest rates work, he says.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Unrepentant peacekeepers will fire on Somali human shields:
UN chief blames warlords for civilian casualties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations said last night its forces would fire on civilians being
used by Somali militiamen as 'human shields', despite casualties among women
and children on Thursday when UN helicopters fired into a crowd.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, said responsibility for
civilian casualties lay with the militiamen who ambushed peacekeeping
troops, using women and children as shields.
UN commanders in Somalia appear to have decided that they will tolerate
heavy civilian casualties in their battle against General Mohammed Farah
Aideed, the rebel warlord.
The US combat helicopters on Thursday opened fire on women and children in
order to rescue trapped colleagues.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said 107 wounded people were
taken to Mogadishu's two hospitals after the attack. It could not verify
Somali claims of more than 100 civilian deaths.
Three months of increasingly bitter conflict have claimed the lives of 48 UN
peacekeepers. Thursday's attack against patrolling US and Pakistani soldiers
were carbon copies of previous ambushes: burning tyres and crowds of women
and children tied down the convoy, while Gen Aideed's snipers took aim from
behind the safety of their 'human shields'.
Seven Nigerian troops were killed in this way last Sunday. The tactic was
first used in June, when 24 Pakistanis were shot and mutilated by a hostile
crowd.
In the latest ambush, US Cobra helicopters shot into the crowd.
The UN yesterday was unrepentant. 'In an ambush there are no sidelines for
spectators,' said Major David Stockwell, the UN military spokesman. He said
civilians close to the scene of an attack were regarded as combatants,
whether armed or not, and that helicopters had dropped leaflets in the city
warning women and children to stay indoors.
In the US, news of civilian casualties reinforced the impression that the
UN's mission in Somalia had gone horribly wrong.
'We went to Somalia to prevent people from starving to death,' said Senator
John McCain, an Arizona Republican. 'Now we are killing women and children.
It's got to stop.' The Senate urged President Bill Clinton to outline his
objectives in Somalia and set a deadline for the departure of US troops. The
Senate debate on Thursday reflected unease in Congress with Mr Clinton's
decision to send 400 crack US commandos to Somalia to capture Gen Aideed.
'The US has become another faction in Mogadishu's clan warfare,' says Mr Mat
Berdal at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
'Playing this cat and mouse game with Gen Aideed has bogged down the whole
UN operation. It has damaged the credibility of the multinational forces.'
Another UN consultant, who asked not to be named, said open confrontation
with Gen Aideed's militias had destroyed the UN's chances of winning the
support of the people of Mogadishu.
Without local support the UN's hopes of disarming the city are futile.
Without disarmament, the chances of restoring peace and stability to the
shattered capital are slim.
'Neither a high-tech aerial war or neighbourhood sweeps on the ground will
flush out Aideed's guerrillas, and direct confrontation will only cause more
civilian casualties,' the consultant said. 'The UN faces a lousy set of
choices.'
The military operation has been further weakened by disputes within the
28-nation force. Many contingents resent the way the US has come to dominate
the peace-enforcing mission. Some question the wisdom of singling out Gen
Aideed as the chief villain. Many commanders have been tempted to cut
informal deals with local militias to protect their men from snipers. There
is little co-operation between troops of different nationalities, and when
disputes occur they rapidly become full-blown diplomatic incidents.
'The main difficulty in coalition warfare is reconciling different national
perspectives, and getting the various forces to accept one set of rules
under a single unified command,' admits Gen Jack Godfrey, chief of staff to
the UN's special representative in Somalia, Admiral Jonathan Howe.
Unless this happens, the UN's 27,000-strong peacekeeping mission in Somalia
risks becoming a costly blunder. The UN is already under fire for spending
ten times more on the military operation than on its humanitarian work. And
with every civilian casualty in Somalia, the UN's ambition to occupy
centre-stage in the resolution of post-cold war conflicts becomes less
credible.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Geography overwhelms history in search for the real
Australia: Nikki Tait interviews Paul Keating, who meets the Queen next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last time Paul Keating met the Queen, there was a small furore when the
Australian prime minister, only two months into the job, put his arm round
the British monarch's waist. 'Mocking Her Majesty,' screamed one British
tabloid. 'Hands orf Cobber,' yelled another.
So, sitting in the Canberra's modernist Parliament House, without a silver
salver in sight, the Australian premier is trying to inject a little
gravitas to their next meeting, at Balmoral in a week's time. Questions
about his potential reception in Britain are parried with sober poise. Even
mention of the tabloid press generates sarcasm, not the colourful epithets
which Keating bandies so adroitly in local political brawls.
But if the Prime Minister's demeanour is muted, his message is not.
Republicanism - that is, Australia's right to appoint its own head of state,
rather than have the British monarch wished on it - has been Australian
Labor party policy for a decade. Mr Keating has become its most forceful
advocate.
'The republic is a constitutional, historical and political necessity for
Australia,' he declares. 'Australia cannot represent itself to the world as
a multicultural society, engage in Asia, make that link and make it
persuasively, while, in some way, at least in constitutional terms,
remaining a derivative society.'
In the Keating school of argument, the need for constitutional change
follows an economic drift. Today, Asia-Pacific accounts for more than 60 per
cent of Australia's trade while half of new immigrants come from that
region.
Twenty years ago, notes Mr Keating, Australia had a 'White Australia' policy
which mitigated against Asian migrants and was only abandoned by the
government of Gough Whitlam in the early 1970s. 'That's not a long time
ago,' he says. 'In the event, we were very lucky not to be marginalised by
Asia. 'Countries in this part of the world have long memories.'
Economic expediency, however, is only one aspect of the Republicanism
debate. Much more fundamental is Australia's search for a national identity.
This is a complex issue for a country that has increasingly significant
financial ties to its neighbours, a weight of cultural bonds with Europe,
and must somehow also find a place for its Aboriginal population, whose
rights have suddenly become big news.
This is largely because of a High Court ruling last year which found that a
group of Aboriginal people were holders of native land title. The previous
concept of 'terra nullius' - that Australia was not occupied before European
settlement - was quashed.
The Mabo ruling, named after Eddie Mabo, the leader of the Meriam people who
began the High Court case in 1982, generated a frenzied backlash from other
interested parties, notably mining companies.
A touch of fervour creeps into Mr Keating's voice when conversation turns to
Mabo. 'The stain of dispossession still affects our society and our
relationship with the indigenes,' he says. 'Mabo is part of a broader agenda
of reconciliation.
'The highest court in Australia has declared that Aboriginal custom and
title is a source of Australian common law, and that native title exists in
common law. But there is no body of administrative law to express that
native title. What the government has been developing is a body of
administrative law to hear, award and protect native title, and to see that
the dual aims of justice for aboriginal and islander people, and the
economic imperatives of the country go together.'
Some of these matters, he is sure, will surface at Balmoral, although he
does not believe he will either surprise the British monarch, or chill the
atmosphere. 'I think she will have read the things I've said in public to
date ..She has absorbed the cultures of umpteen prime ministers over the
years. I'm sure she can cope with me adequately.'
In truth, even if the atmosphere in Scotland did drop a few degrees, it
would probably be a good deal warmer than the political climate back home.
Less than six months after his unexpected election victory, Mr Keating is
being jostled on all sides.
The new government's first budget, unveiled last month, has been stymied in
parliment, and concessions wrung by both the opposition parties and the
Labor party caucus. Uncertainty surrounding passage of this package has
contributed to a plunge in the Australian dollar, now at a seven-year low.
On the crucial issue of labour market reform, Mr Keating appears to have
bowed to the powerful union lobby, and seems likely to temper government
plans. Recent polls, meanwhile, have shown a significant drop in Mr
Keating's personal approval rating.
All this has prompted some commentators to suggest that the Prime Minister -
often seen as a distant figure, who ploughs his own furrow without excessive
consultation - may have to adjust his approach. So what lessons has Mr
Keating learnt from his rough ride during the past few weeks? 'Just that
politics is rough riding,' he retorts tartly, as the diplomatic demeanour
eases briefly.

NIGERIA'S interim government said last night the thwarted presidential
contender Moshood Abiola had agreed not to return home as planned so as not
to disrupt public order, Reuter reports from Abuja.
A statement said Mr Abiola had agreed not to return tomorrow as planned
after contacts with interim head of state Ernest Shonekan.
Earlier, Nigeria's electoral commission and the country's two political
parties agreed to hold a fresh presidential poll on February 19, just over a
month before the military-appointed interim government is due to relinquish
power.
The statement said: 'Both men agreed the progressive return of normalcy is
essential for the political and economic wellbeing of Nigeria, and anything
that will disrupt the peace should therefore be avoided.'
Mr Abiola, regarded as the winner of a June 12 presidential election
annulled by former military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, has been abroad
mobilising support for his claim to the presidency.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Shame about the high prices
</HEADLINE>

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
JAPANESE consumers will from next month be able to compare officially vetted
import cost prices with astronomically high retail prices, writes William
Dawkins.
The move is part of the new government's drive to encourage consumers'
interests in a country traditionally run with reference to producers' lobby
groups. It is among a series of measures under preparation for inclusion in
an economic stimulus package later this month, to lean on companies to pass
on the benefits of the yen's strength to consumers.
Finance ministry officials say they will soon publish monthly lists of
average importers' cost prices of 20 basic goods, such as meat, fruit and
whisky.
The aim is to shame distributors into dropping prices when consumers learn
of the huge profit margins usually added to imported goods by layers of
middlemen.

journey through many layers of middlemen between warehouse and shop.
A box of imported US nappies, for example, bought in central Tokyo last
week, cost Y2,000 (Pounds 12.26) while 200 grammes of Parmesan cheese could
be had - on special offer - at a local supermarket for Y900 yesterday
morning.
This could hasten the growth of discount stores, selling clothing, food and
electrical goods, which have emerged in Tokyo in recent years. Welcomed by
bargain-hunters, the new stores are even becoming fashionable.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Israelis asked to trust their former
enemy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALMOST 30 years, since its foundation in 1964, millions of Israelis have
been brought up to regard the Palestine Liberation Organisation with
revulsion - as a terrorist organisation single-mindedly committed to
Israel's destruction. And their greatest disdain has been reserved for a man
they see as the arch-terrorist himself, the sly, unshaven, pistol-packing
demon at its helm, Yassir Arafat.
One Israeli newspaper said yesterday Mr Arafat's PLO had, directly and
indirectly, been responsible for the deaths of 1,311 Israelis in the course
of three decades of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the wounding of more
than 14,000.
Soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories, schoolchildren inside
Israel, Israeli and Jewish passengers on foreign airlines and ships in
distant continents, even Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games have been
targets for the PLO.
Almost overnight, the Israeli public is being asked to undergo a profound
and fundamental shift: not just to embrace the enemy, but to trust him as
well.
Until recently it was illegal for Israelis to have any contact with PLO
officials, let alone Mr Arafat.
Mr Menachem Begin, the late Likud prime minister, would refer to Mr Arafat
as 'that two-legged animal' and, during the Israeli siege of Beirut in the
summer of 1982, approved an assassination attempt on him.
Yet by early next year, provided Palestinian self-government is implemented
on schedule, Mr Arafat and his nominated deputees will assume responsibility
for law and order in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. He
will control a large police force and confer with the very same Israeli
security services that once plotted his downfall.
The Israeli right-wing and its supporters are simply unwilling to concede
the possibility that Mr Arafat and his organisation have changed.
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud, claims Mr Arafat is
as determined as ever to destroy Israel, but has merely adopted a 'phased
programme' - taking Gaza and Jericho first, but keeping his sights set
firmly on taking over all Israeli territory, and especially Jerusalem, the
capital city claimed by both sides.
Mr Ariel Sharon, the former defence minister who led the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon in 1982, is even less complimentary. 'Arafat is a war criminal by
any standards. There is not a man in the world today with so much Jewish
blood on his hands. There's no place for peace with Arafat.'
Not so, says Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, the man who spearheaded
the 14 months of secret talks with the PLO that brought the breakthrough.
'The PLO was a terrorist organisation. But the PLO has today stopped being
the PLO. It has torn its charter to pieces.'
Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin stands uneasily in the centre,
dismayed by Likud's flat rejection, but still not entirely persuaded by Mr
Peres's enthusiasm. There was a clear element of embarrassment and discomfit
in the way he grinningly welcomed Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, Norwegian foreign
minister, to his office yesterday, blushingly remarking: 'I believe you've
brought a certain letter.'
It was only last May, after all, that Mr Rabin was calling on Israel 'not to
trust Palestinians any more, even those with good intentions.' And even over
the last couple of days, briefing his party colleagues, he has stressed that
he still regards the PLO as a 'most unpleasant' enemy.
If the concept of making peace with Mr Arafat is still troubling Mr Rabin,
it is hardly surprising that most Israelis are troubled too. But Mr Arafat
seems to be doing his best to win them over.
For the past week, the PLO has been hosting an Israel Television crew at its
Tunis headquarters. 'Peace is on its way,' he said with the broadest of
smiles, 'there is no turning back. The first steps to peace have begun,' he
said.
'With Allah's help, we'll meet again in Jericho,' he promised the Israeli
correspondent, rising to shake his hand. But behind the chairman, as the
camera panned back, was a photograph of the Dome of the Rock, on the Temple
Mount, in Jerusalem.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Clinton hails accord as 'shining moment
of hope'

THE US formally announced that it would renew its contacts with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday, opening the way for PLO and
Israeli leaders to sign an historic peace agreement at the White House on
Monday.
The announcement followed the signature earlier by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli prime minister, of a letter recognising the PLO as representing the
Palestinian people.
Mr Rabin signed the letter after receiving a similar letter from Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO chairman, recognising Israel's right to exist in peace and
security and renouncing the use of terrorism.
Mr Rabin said he was prepared to meet Mr Arafat but he ruled out the
possibility of attending Monday's ceremony.
Immediately after signing the letter of recognition Mr Rabin said: 'It's an
historic moment that hopefully will bring about an end to 100 years of
bloodshed, misery between the Palestinians and Jews.'
He said the agreement was only the first step towards a comprehensive Middle
East peace. 'It's only the beginning but a tremendous, important beginning,'
said the former general flanked during a televised ceremony by Mr Peres and
Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister who played a critical
role bringing the two sides together.
Hundreds of excited Palestinians later demonstrated in favour of the
agreement in occupied Arab east Jerusalem and, in an unprecedented event,
unfurled the banned Palestinian flag over the stone battlements of
Jerusalem's old city.
In Gaza thousands of Palestinians danced on the streets, celebrating the
accord and shook hands with Israeli soldiers.
At the White House ceremony on Monday, Israeli and Palestinian
representatives are expected to sign a further agreement outlining
arrangements for setting up a Palestinian administration in the occupied
territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said he hoped also to reach a
peace agreement with Jordan next week to complete a 'triangle' of peaceful
Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian coexistence which 'would change the entire
fabric of the Middle East.'
President Bill Clinton, announcing the US decision to resume contacts with
the PLO, described the agreement between Israel and the PLO as 'a shining
moment of hope for the people of the Middle East and, indeed, of the entire
world.'
He said the US would 'continue to be a full and active partner in the
negotiations that lie ahead to ensure that this promise of progress is
realised.' In an attempt to build support for the peace pact, he telephoned
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi.
The US broke off the dialogue it had begun with the PLO two years earlier
after a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv in 1990.
Mr Clinton said yesterday that the resumption of dialogue was justified by
the PLO's commitment to accept Israel's right to exist in peace and
security; to renounce terrorism; to take responsibility for the actions of
its constituent groups; to discipline those groups which violated the new
commitments; and to nullify parts of its charter denying Israel's right to
exist.
While the US decision stops short of according full diplomatic recognition
to the PLO, it is expected to lead to the re-opening of PLO representative
offices in the US and will certainly allow PLO leaders to enter the US for
Monday's signing ceremony.
It led to an immediate meeting in Tunis between US and PLO diplomats at
which the US formally invited a PLO delegation to Washington for the
signing.
Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, is expected to sign for his
government, but it was not yet clear yesterday who would represent the PLO.
Mr Mahmoud Abbas, head of the PLO's political affairs department, was one
possibility.
The ceremony is also expected to be attended by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
Russian foreign minister and Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister.
Invitations have been extended to former US presidents and secretaries of
state, including Mr James Baker, who was the chief architect of the Middle
East peace talks, the framework for which he achieved in eight shuttles to
the region starting immediately after the end of the Gulf war.
In Jerusalem, right-wing demonstrators outside the prime minister's office
branded the peace agreement as treason. Several hundred protesters banged
metal cans and signs.
Palestinian rejectionists on the PLO executive comittee similarly branded Mr
Arafat a traitor and there was a demonstration against him in Gaza.
But despite this the Palestinian leader's popularity appeared to be
increasing in much of the occupied territories, especially in the West Bank,
and PLO leaders meeting in Tunis last night approved the agreement which the
organisation is expected to sign in Washington on Monday. The deal gives
Palestinians limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Jordan could sign deal with Israel next
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN, the Jordanian ruler, yesterday said he believed Jordan could
sign an outline peace agreement with Israel in Washington next week, soon
after the PLO and Israel sign their declaration of principles on Monday.
Speaking in Britain where he has been on a private visit, King Hussein said
negotiators in Washington would sign the 'agenda' to guide detailed
negotiations with its neighbour 'if not on Monday, then Tuesday at the
most'.
The king said agreeing a full peace treaty with Israel would take time, but
added: 'Certainly the process leading to resolving all the problems, as they
relate to Israel and Jordan - the beginning will be very, very soon.'
The Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks in Washington had been the least
problematic of the four simultaneously negotiated tracks between Israel and
the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria.
Jordan's talks with Israel have centred on the return of two small strips of
land and water rights. Amman had essentially been waiting for the
Palestinians to reach agreement with Israel.
King Hussein, after initial anger at having been bypassed by the PLO in its
secret negotiations with Israel, has since publicly backed the accord. Last
night he said it was 'a very important landmark. . . I would certainly hope
that it will. . . lead to peace in our region.'
Neither Syria nor Lebanon have announced any progress in the latest talks in
Washington, which ended this week. Both remained impassive yesterday at
Israel's recognition of the PLO - Syria particularly is rankled by the PLO's
lack of consultation. Damascus restated its demand that the Jewish state
must withdraw from all occupied Arab land, while Lebanon rejected an Israeli
paper presented to its negotiators at the peace talks in Washington, saying
it ignored UN Resolution 425 which demands unconditional Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has won
his prize of recognition by Israel. But his historic diplomatic victory has
riven the PLO fold, and many in the movement believe the deal with Israel
could still backfire if its cost proves to be Palestinian national unity.
Mr Arafat's acceptance of a limited Palestinian autonomy, beginning in the
Gaza Strip and Jericho, along with Israeli conditions for mutual
recognition, has cost him the support of some of his closest comrades and
fuelled unprecedented dissent within the organisation.
Mr Arafat is convinced he has seized an historic opportunity he could not
afford to miss. He has also evidently decided to abandon efforts to retain a
Palestinian consensus which, in the view of some of his aides, had
previously paralysed the organisation.
He thus appears unperturbed by the slender majority by which the PLO
executive committee approved agreement with Israel late this week. Eight out
of 18 voted for the deal, four voted against, four more had already resigned
or boycotted the meeting, one could not attend and one abstained.
Opposition to the concessions made by Mr Arafat to win recognition was
predictably immediate and outraged from the traditional 'rejectionist'
Palestinian groups, which oppose in principle the talks with Israel. Mr
Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -
General Command, called yesterday his 'blackest day', and warned that
'Arafat and his group will be punished by the Palestinian people.' Fatah
Uprising, a radical splinter group, declared it would 'shed the blood of the
treacherous Arafat.'
More significantly, Palestinian opposition over the past week has not been
confined to traditional rejectionist groups. Many voicing concern include
supporters of the peace process - including Mr Mahmoud Darwish, the
prominent Palestinian poet, Mr Shafiq Al Hout, PLO representative in
Lebanon, both of whom have resigned from the organisation in protest, and Mr
Abdullah Hourani, an independent PLO committee member.
Yesterday, Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, PLO foreign minister, and number two in Mr
Arafat's own mainstream Fatah movement, bitterly rejected the agreements,
arguing that the leadership had no right to give up the Palestinian people's
rights.
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, the main opposition groups within the
organisation, have already joined Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement,
and are leading seven smaller groups in a campaign against Mr Arafat's
strategy.
Although the opposition lacks coherence and a unified platform, it could
still threaten Mr Arafat's undertaking, in the name of the PLO, to cease
violence against Israel and discipline PLO members who violate this
agreement.
The DFLP and PFLP are now considering withdrawing from the organisation, and
joining Hamas, which has never been part of the PLO.
But Mr Arafat's failure to consult his colleagues is not the only cause of
mounting dissent. In the view of his critics, he has made dear concessions
in return for an Israeli recognition of the PLO which falls short of
recognising the organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people and their national rights.
Israel has already claimed that the PLO to which they have accorded
recognition is different from that which they had for decades opposed as a
mortal ememy. The converse effect on many Palestinians is to give rise to
fears that by accepting the Israeli conditions, the PLO has in fact become
stripped of its historic identity as the embodiment of Palestinian
nationalism.
After gaining long-awaited and crucial recognition from Israel, Mr Arafat
now faces a struggle to prove that the PLO remains true to the Palestinians'
national rights and aspirations.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Paris certain farm talks will reopen
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE confidently expects the EC to reopen negotiations with the US on
Blair House, the farm trade accord reached last November, when foreign and
agriculture ministers of the Community meet at a special council in Brussels
on September 20.
Mr Jean Puech, French agriculture minister, said yesterday after meeting Mr
Andre Bourgeois, farm minister of Belgium, which currently holds the EC
presidency, that 'we are confident our position has now been understood'.
However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, warned France
yesterday that its rejection of the EC-US farm trade deal risked blocking
the Gatt Uruguay Round of world trade reform talks in Geneva.
'The Blair House agreement will not be reopened, in the view of the federal
government,' he said after talks with Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry
minister.
Only if France could prove that the deal went beyond the agreed EC farm
reforms would Germany be prepared to consider ways of finding a compromise,
Mr Rexrodt said.
Nonetheless, Mr Puech was adamant yesterday that the alternative to
reopening the deal was 'a useless crisis in the Community'. He reiterated
France's threat to exercise a veto which would wreck any chance of
concluding the overall Gatt talks by their December 15 deadline.
The minister underlined that 'France does not want this.' Mr Puech refused
to confirm the accounts of senior officials from other EC member states that
France had entered direct talks with the US on improving Blair House and the
farm chapter of the Uruguay Round.
These officials and senior Commission officers say that the French
government, Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, and
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, have all been in negotiations
with Washington to get a form of words on agriculture and other chapters of
the Uruguay Round acceptable to France.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, is to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, in Washington on Monday in what officials say may be a
critical part of these negotiations.
Mr Puech said 'we have to change Blair House,' but on further questioning
modified this to mean 'to complete and interpret' the farm trade accord. The
European Commission has said that there can be no reopening of the accord.
At the September 20 meeting, therefore, France needs the unanimous support
of its partners if it is to go back into the detail of the deal, rather than
try to improve it through side agreements.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Italy approves budget cost-saving measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S government early yesterday morning, after an 11-hour cabinet
session, approved tough cost-saving measures to raise an extra L28,000bn
(Pounds 11.8bn) in the 1994 budget.
The planned extra revenues, combined with limited new fiscal measures, will
raise L32,000bn. This will hold the public sector deficit down to
L144,000bn. The cuts, which caused considerable ministerial tensions, will
have to be endorsed by parliament.
The speed with which parliament approves the budget will have a direct
impact on the date for early elections. Parliament is technically meant to
pass the budget by December 30 but this date has often been ignored.
With new electoral laws in place since last month, parliament is expected to
have completed the introduction of legislation on constituency changes by
late December.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, said yesterday the austerity
budget sought to spread the burden of sacrifice. Several tax measures were
specifically designed to benefit the less wealthy, such as provisions for
property tax and exemptions on basic health payments. However, the
government risks being accused of failing to address sufficiently, either in
terms of direct aid or tax incentives, the problem of Italy's rising
unemployment.
Mr Ciampi, a former governor of the Bank of Italy, insisted the budget was a
strong signal to the international community that the country was intent on
regaining financial credibility by putting its public accounts in order. The
budget, he said, would have a primary surplus (the balance of income and
revenue excluding debt service payments) of L32,000bn, equivalent to nearly
2 per cent of GDP.
The 1994 budget devotes unprecedented attention to finding savings through
reform of the public administration and reducing the privileges of civil
servants. The proposals include:
Transformation of the ministry of posts into a public company/agency.
Abolition of the ministry of merchant marine and the absorption of its
activities in a restructured transport ministry.
Abolition of all but two inter-ministerial committees and 'quangos'.
Devolution of central control of universities and schools to the
institutions themselves.
A virtual block on civil service recruitment and greater job mobility
combined with greater freedom to hire and fire.
Reducing pension privileges by penalising early retirement.
Ministers said yesterday the transformation of the posts ministry into an
agency would save L1,500bn. Potentially bigger savings will come from
reforms in the education ministry. Between officials and teachers this
ministry accounts for 1.1m public sector employees.
There will be a block on hiring new teachers while the devolution of
management to the educational establishments is expected to create a far
efficient use of resources.
Furthermore the civil service will be subjected to a policy of limited
recruitment.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Global warrant for ex-BCI chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN magistrates have issued an international arrest warrant on a charge of
alleged corruption for Mr Enrico Braggiotti, former chief executive of Banca
Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the leading state-controlled bank, writes Robert
Graham. Mr Braggiotti is the second senior banker to be caught up in
investigations into bribery and corruption surrounding the 'Enimont affair'.
This involved the 1990 sale at an inflated price of the Ferruzzi group's 40
per cent stake in Enimont, a chemicals venture with Eni, the state oil
concern.
A local arrest warrant was issued for Mr Braggiotti on September 3, but this
only came to light yesterday when the banker was formerly declared a
fugitive from justice. Mr Braggiotti, also a former board member of
Mediobanca, is currently chairman of Compagnie Monegasque de Banque.
According to leaks from Milan magistrates, Mr Braggiotti is wanted in
connection with a pay-off worth up to L5bn (Pounds 2m) made on the orders of
the late Mr Raul Gardini, then chief executive of Ferruzzi-Montedison, to Mr
Vincenzo Palladino, former deputy chairman of BCI.
Mr Palladino was last week released from jail after being arrested on July
29 on allegations that he pocketed the money from Montedison while he was a
court-appointed custodian of Enimont shares in November 1990. This was the
moment when a deal was being worked out between Mr Gardini and Eni for
Ferruzzi-Montedison's stake that subsequently led to political pay-offs
totalling L150bn.
Mr Braggiotti is alleged to have helped smooth Mr Palladino's relations with
Mr Gardini and then aided the former in receiving up to L2bn from Montedison
by putting him in touch with a Panamanian company that accepted a false
billing.
It was also announced yesterday that Mr Diego Curto, the deputy head of the
Milan courts jailed last Friday on charges of accepting L320m for his part
in the Enimont affair, had been stripped of his pay and suspended from all
judicial functions. Mr Curto was the judge responsible for ordering a freeze
on Enimont shares in November 1990 and placing them in the hands of Mr
Palladino.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Clinton reasserts superpower role

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asserted the US's willingness to assume the
responsibility of world leadership in an effort to assuage doubts about
America's view of its role as the sole remaining superpower.
While acknowledging that the US had played a peripheral part in the secret
negotiations that led to mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, Mr Clinton said the deal offered an opportunity for
an 'effort to reassert and define America's role in a very new world.
'We must develop a strong philosophy and a practical set of institutions
that can permit us to follow our values and our interests and to work for a
more humane and a more democratic world,' Mr Clinton said at a White House
ceremony to announce that the US would resume contacts with the PLO.
Since he took office Mr Clinton has not always been able to strike an
effective balance between his desire to act multilaterally and his inability
to push his allies in the directions he wishes to go.
In Bosnia the US has tried to lead the UN and Nato towards a firmer policy
against Serbian and Croatian aggression, but has backed off when confronted
by European resistance.
Mr Clinton yesterday asserted a compelling US interest in 'peace, the
absence of oppression, the recognition of human rights - both on an
individual and group basis - and, wherever possible, democracy.
'I believe that while we must work with our friends and neighbours and
allies through multilateral organisations as much as possible, the
leadership of the United States is still absolutely essential to bring many
of these conflicts to a successful conclusion,' the president said.
'It is clear to me that for the foreseeable future we have a unique role
which we must assume, and it is very much in our interest as well as
consistent with our values to do it.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in US wholesale prices last month provided further confirmation
of declining inflationary pressures, the Labour Department reported
yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.6 per cent between July
and August, against a consensus forecast on Wall Street of a rise of 0.2 per
cent.
It was the third consecutive monthly decline. The annual rate of producer
price inflation fell to 0.6 per cent against 1.3 per cent in July.
Officials said the sharp fall in wholesale prices mainly reflected an
erratic 25.6 per cent decline in tobacco prices last month. A 0.5 per cent
increase in food prices was more than offset by a 0.8 per cent decline in
the cost of energy.
The 'core' producer price index, which excludes food and energy, fell 1 per
cent. Excluding tobacco, core prices were up 0.2 per cent.
The weakness of wholesale prices was consistent with recent reports of
sluggish economic growth.

Investors are offered astonishingly high rates of interest. A scheme being

FIGHTING flared between Serb and Croat forces around Serb controlled regions
in Croatia yesterday, threatening to rekindle the war between the Croat
government and rebel Serbs in the area.
Serb forces in the Krajina enclave shelled Croat government positions, after
Croat forces launched an offensive in the Gospic area and captured three
villages.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace envoy, urged Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman to order his troops to withdraw from the villages, but Croatia's
army chief insisted the push was a limited operation.
General Jean Cot, commander of the UN protection forces in the former
Yugoslavia, said: 'The past 24 hours have seen the most dramatic increase in
tensions since January 22.'
The Croat offensive, which began on Thursday, marked the first attack across
the UN ceasefire lines for eight months. It fuels fears that any lull in the
fighting in Bosnia could rapidly be replaced by renewed battles in Croatia.
The six-month war which Croatia fought with the rebel Serbs around the
enclave two years ago officially ended in January 1992, after the Serbs were
given de facto control of the Krajina area, monitored by some 15,000 UN
peacekeepers. This situation left the Croatian government hoping it would
eventually regain the territory.
But in recent weeks skirmishes along the border have intensified, as the
Croat government has become increasingly concerned that the proposed
partition of Bosnia could herald the partition of Croatia as well and the
rebel Serbs grow optimistic that the peace plan will allow them to link
Krajina with Serbia.
A Bosnian Serb army commander has ordered a group of mutinous soldiers to
lift immediately their blockade of the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja
Luka, AP reports from Belgrade. Bosnian Serb soldiers demanding the
punishment of war racketeers were reported to have seized the northern town
early yesterday and ringed key buildings with tanks.

VOLKSWAGEN'S attempts to polish its tarnished corporate image have upset
Dresdner Bank, one of its close associates, writes Christopher Parkes in
Frankfurt.
The bank, represented on the VW supervisory board by main board director Mr
Bernd Voss, is believed to have complained to the motor group that it took
liberties with its analysts' latest report on VW in an advertising campaign.
A recent full-page newspaper advertisement touting VW shares drew heavily
and selectively on an August 30 study from Dresdner International Advisors,
which described the stock as 'under-valued'.
The embarrassed bank said yesterday the extracts were taken out of context
from a news agency report, and disregarded criticism of poor performance at
the group's Seat subsidiary in Spain.
The advertisement is part of a corporate campaign apparently designed to
offset media criticism and the effects on the group's image of the
continuing probe into allegations that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
production director, stole secrets from General Motors, his former employer.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday threw down another
constitutional challenge to the country's parliament when he stated in a
letter to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, that he would
not sign a budget law sent to him by parliament.
Mr Yeltsin justified this second, unconstitutional, refusal to sign by
claiming the budget law was new because it had a new name. Mr Khasbulatov,
in an angry reply, insisted it be signed.
The clash came as a senior government adviser warned that the government was
now powerless to stop hyperinflation and financial collapse.
Irrespective of the outcome of this exchange, the parliament is due to
discuss yet another budget law, with revised figures, which would mean an
even larger budget deficit than that already forecast. The present bill
already calls for a deficit amounting to 20-25 per cent of GDP.
Mr Yeltsin will eventually have to choose between unconstitutionality and
signing a bill with huge deficit implications.
In a series of comments gloomy even by Russian standards, Mr Andrei
Ilyaronov, adviser to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, said the
government would have to operate one or other law passed by the parliament -
and that would mean a collapse of the state's finances by the end of the
year.
Mr Ilyaronov, supported by Mr Sergei Vassilyev, head of the government's
Centre for Economic Performance, and Professor Anders Aslund, a government
adviser, said the agreement between the government and the central bank to
limit credit expansion to 20 per cent in the current and the fourth quarter
of the year was already destroyed.
Credit expansion in the current quarter would be at least 43 per cent, while
that figure would be exceeded 'several times' in the final quarter because
of budget demands.

THE French economy should emerge from recession in the final quarter of this
year and stage a recovery in 1994, according to the latest analysis by Bipe,
a leading economics institute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Bipe expects the recovery to start slowly in the first quarter of 1994 and
to gain momentum through the year. It sees GDP growth of 0.8 per cent
(excluding invisible earnings) for 1994, following a fall of 1.5 per cent in
1993.
The general trends in Bipe's forecast are similar to those outlined earlier
this week by the Economy Ministry. However, the institute is less optimistic
about the pace of recovery. The ministry expects growth (including invisible
earnings) of 1.4 per cent for 1994.
Retail prices were static in August, according to provisional figures
published yesterday by Insee, the state statistics institute, bringing the
annualised inflation rate to 2.2 per cent.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Norwegian parties put their faith in higher taxes:
Unemployment is key election issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Thorbjoern Jagland, leader of Norway's Labour party although not its
prime ministerial candidate, was adamant in the final televised debate
before Monday's general election that higher taxes and more public jobs were
the way to solve the country's persistent unemployment problem.
'We will have to accept that higher taxes will be necessary to create more
jobs and that we will use the public sector as a motor to create new jobs,'
he said in a debate between candidates from eight parties.
The ruling Labour party clings to socialist orthodoxies long after most of
Europe's social democratic parties have adopted market policies to shore up
diminishing support. But in Norway, where oil wealth has helped cushion the
economic shocks which have hit the continent in recent years, the European
trend to cut government spending as the way to attack unemployment is little
in evidence. Labour looks set to return to power in Monday's vote, according
to polls.
Aside from the question of Norway's membership in the EC, how to deal with
post-war record unemployment of 8.2 per cent has been the dominant issue in
an otherwise lacklustre campaign.
In Thursday night's debate, held in the lakeside town of Gjoevik, the main
opposition Conservative party's spokesman on the economy, Mr Per-Kristian
Foss, was a minority voice when he said Norway should be dismantling its
high tax regime and big public sector if the country wanted to create jobs.
'Every time Labour has promised lower unemployment in an election campaign,
it has gone up,' Mr Foss said.
However, even the right-wing Progress party, which was founded on a
tax-cutting platform, seems to have abandoned this ideal in the face of
public demand for immediate solutions to the unemployment problem. Most of
the attacks on Labour during the debate came from the Centre party, the
Socialist Left party and the neo-Maoist Red Choice Alliance which, to
varying degrees, argued for more state involvement in the fight against
joblessness, despite annual government spending of NKr20bn (Pounds 1.87bn)
on training schemes.
The representatives of the three parties also called for a special tax on
overtime, which Labour has rejected. They claim more that 130,000 Norwegians
have more than one job, and by taxing overtime some 108,000 jobs could be
immediately created.
Nor did the Christian People's party, just four years ago a Conservative
coalition partner, offer much support to Mr Foss. Instead, Mr Jon Lilletun,
its representative, called for the pension age to be lowered to 64 from 67
to create 30,000 new jobs.
A right turn in economic policy therefore seems unlikely after Monday's
vote. With Labour consistently leading in the polls, but with no prospect of
winning an overall majority, the expectation is it will form a government
relying principally on the backing of the Socialist Left and Centre parties.
This will mean a delicate balancing act for Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland,
Labour's figurehead and trump card as an experienced and respected prime
minister. Assuming she returns to power, she will have to maintain the
partners' support, despite their vehement opposition to Labour's application
for Norwegian membership of the EC.
In what promises to be a complex pattern of party alliances, Labour will
look to the Conservatives, the second largest party, for backing on the EC
issue.
The Conservatives would like to form another coalition, as they did after
the last election, in 1989. But that is unlikely because of the lack of
pro-European partners. The previous coalition with the Christian People's
party and the Centre party fell apart after a year over the junior partners'
opposition to EC membership.

NORWAY'S ruling Labour party remains on course to return to power in
Monday's general election, according to an opinion poll published today,
Hugh Carnegy reports from Oslo. However, another poll yesterday showed a
clear majority against membership of the EC, underlining the tough task
facing a new Labour administration committed to pushing ahead with Oslo's
application to join the community.
The election poll in the newspaper Aftenposten showed support for Labour at
36.2 per cent, down slightly from earlier this week but still well ahead of
its nearest rival, the Conservative party, which was up almost 2 points at
21.1 per cent. The anti-EC Centre party continued its sharp rise in the
polls to 12.8 per cent.
Opposition to EC membership, meanwhile, stood at 54 per cent.

the cabinet room.
A close aide to Mr Yeltsin yesterday forecast the creation of a political
union of former Soviet states which would 'logically and inevitably' follow
the steps now being taken towards greater economic integration.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's chief spokesman, said in the popular
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that 'a new deal which will define the
geopolitical contours and the strategic parameters of a new community' was
now possible, after the 'uprooting of a few prickly nationalist weeds'.
It was only, he said, 'a matter of time'.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Independent asks OFT to review Times price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent newspaper yesterday called on the Office of Fair Trading to
investigate the 15p cut in the cover price of its rival, The Times.
The submission came at the end of the first week of the 30p Times. Newspaper
wholesalers were last night reporting results of surveys showing The Times
may have increased its sales by just under 40 per cent, although News
International claimed a more modest 22 per cent rise.
In its submission to the OFT, The Independent accused Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of News Corporation, of deliberately accepting short-term losses at
The Times to try to force The Independent out of the market.
Such 'predatory pricing' - lowering prices to uneconomic levels in the short
term with the intention of eliminating competition - amounts to an unlawful
anti-competitive practice under the 1980 Competition Act.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor-in-chief of The Independent, said: 'Our
best estimates suggest The Times would need to increase circulation by over
60 per cent - an additional 200,000 copies - to break even at 30p. This is
simply impossible.'
The formal complaint came even though The Independent conceded that a survey
of 1,000 outlets covering the first three days of this week showed the
paper's circulation had risen by 3 per cent.
The Times price cut seems to have increased the overall broadsheet market by
about 3 per cent, with the circulation of the Financial Times and The
Guardian unaffected but The Daily Telegraph down some 3 per cent.
In July The Times sold an average 359,822 copies daily, The Independent
334,993 and The Daily Telegraph 1.017m. A Times spokesman said yesterday:
'We believe we have nothing to fear from an open investigation by the OFT.'
If an investigation found The Times guilty of unlawful predatory pricing,
the OFT could seek undertakings on future pricing policy. A refusal to give
such undertakings could lead to a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Canary Wharf banks in Pounds 1.1bn rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS yesterday put forward proposals for a Pounds 1.1bn rescue package to
save Canary Wharf, the insolvent London Docklands office scheme, from
liquidation.
The proposals would pave the way for the Pounds 1.8bn extension to east
London of London Underground's Jubilee Line.
The agreement, hammered out during more than a year of complex negotiations,
depends on approval by the project's 1,400 unsecured creditors at a meeting
on September 30. If agreement is reached, Canary Wharf is expected to emerge
from administration, a UK insolvency procedure, by the end of October.
Canary Wharf, which cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build, has been valued at
just Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m. The rescue package depends on the secured
lenders investing substantial new funds in the project in the expectation of
recouping more of their existing Pounds 568m of loans.
Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank, which co-ordinated the rescue package, said
the banks intended to hold on to their investment at present. 'We believe
that the value of the project is in the future,' he said.
Unsecured creditors, who have been offered payment of up to 15p in the
pound, have been told they have no chance of securing a better offer. Mr
Cheyne said that if creditors rejected the deal, Canary Wharf would go into
liquidation, which would be 'a tragedy for the Docklands'.
The rescue of Canary Wharf and the Jubilee Line extension could have a
lasting impact on the potential success of Docklands, which suffered a
crisis in confidence after the insolvency of Canary Wharf in May 1992.
Better transport links would help Docklands overcome its difficulties in
attracting tenants, which, with the collapse in the London office market,
resulted in the failure of Canary Wharf.
The government is expected to approve the Jubilee Line extension once the
Olympia &amp; York companies come out of administration. Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, said securing the private sector contribution cleared
'a very large hurdle'. The government had delay-ed approving the project
until it had secured the private sector contribution promised by O&amp;Y, the
Canadian company which was the original developer of Canary Wharf.
The rescue package involves the restructuring of Pounds 568m of existing
debt and the payment of additional new finance of up to Pounds 278m plus
another Pounds 300m over 25 years for the Jubilee Line extension.

FT  11 SEP 93 / 'We're making history here': The possibility of peace is
dawning in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR years it has been illegal to demonstrate in East Jerusalem; to wave a
Palestinian flag was an act of defiance. It still is. But yesterday the
Israeli army just stood by.
Soldiers did not fire tear gas and Palestinians did not throw stones as
several hundred youths unfurled the red, green, white and black standard of
Palestine over the stone battlements of Jerusalem's old city.
The demonstrators, many in military fatigues and black and white Palestinian
scarves, clapped, danced and chanted songs in praise of Mr Yassir Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Their chanting echoed across a city built by King David and his son,
Solomon, nearly three millennia ago and which has provoked religious
conflict, political rivalry and foreign conquest in an almost uninterrupted
flow ever since. Posters of Mr Arafat were carried high above the crowd
gathered outside the old city's ancient Damascus gate.
The change in climate is electrifying. 'I have never seen this before,' said
Mr Abed Alloun, a student representative. 'We are making history here. We
are taking our political rights from the Israeli occupiers and soon we will
have our own state.'
As the significance of the peace accord dawns on both sides of the Green
Line which divides Arab and Jew in this holy city, support for the agreement
is growing.
Opinion polls of Palestinians show a clear 60-65 per cent in favour of the
deal. 'People are excited and happy about it. Most feel it is the first step
to a Palestinian state after 45 years of hell,' said Mr Nabil Feidy, a
money-changer on Salahadin Street in east Jerusalem.
'People aren't dancing on the rooftops yet. There are a lot of questions to
be answered like what will happen to us in east Jerusalem. A lot of people
still have their relatives in jail. Mothers and fathers have lost their
children in the intifada (the Palestinian uprising). It will take time.'
As fear wanes, support is also mounting among Israelis, despite vociferous
protests by Jewish settlers and other rightwingers against what they term
the 'treachery and foolishness' of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime
minister. An opinion poll in yesterday's Hebrew newspaper Yediot Ahronot
found 57 per cent of Israelis supported the accord, with 41 per cent
opposed. A week ago only 53 per cent backed the deal, with 44 per cent
against. The survey also found, however, that a large majority - 68 per cent
 -want Mr Rabin to hold a referendum on the agreement.
Many of Israel's toughest generals who have faced Arab armies in four major
wars and countless small ones endorse the agreement.
Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the minister of construction, who spent 27 years in
uniform, said: 'For most of my life, I battled against the PLO.' Making
peace with the organisation, he said, 'was a dream come true. I am glad that
my generation, which carried the burden of all those wars, is trying to save
the next generation.'
Mr Mordechai Gur, deputy defence minister and former head of the paratroop
division which captured Arab east Jerusalem in 1967, added simply: 'This is
what we fought for.'
Even relatives of victims of PLO attacks on Israel have been speaking out in
favour of the accommodation. Ms Ilana Romano, widow of one of the 11 Israeli
athletes murdered at the 1972 Munich Olympics, said she had been in 'a state
of inner turmoil' since news of the talks with the PLO broke. She could
never forgive Mr Arafat but she said: 'I want peace very much. If even one
life is saved, it will be worthwhile.'
The peace may be signed and is about to be sealed but it has yet to be
delivered. No two peoples are so divided by mutual hatred, while at the same
time united in the absoluteness of their claims to God-given sovereignty
over the same piece of land. Yesterday, on the holiest day of the week for
both religions, Jews and Arabs prayed 100 yards from each other in the old
city.
Pious Palestinians kneeled in submission to Allah at the Dome of the Rock
Mosque while Orthodox Jews prostrated themselves before the Wailing Wall.
Both are united in their belief that the mutual recognition between the PLO
and Israel, concluded yesterday by Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin, is a sell-out and
a sin against God.
'This land is our land, our Islamic land,' said Mr Souhail Abed, clad in a
Palestinian kafiyeh, as he left the stone-walled city through the Damascus
gate.
'Arafat has no right to give up our holy land,' he said. 'My country is in
Jaffa (a suburb of Tel Aviv) and nobody will give this back under the
agreement. I don't accept it.'
Mr Gerson Friedman, an orthodox Jew, has similar feelings. 'God gave this
land to us. Giving up even a small piece of it is like giving up your finger
or your heart,' he said, as he stood in his black suit and hat in front of
the Wailing Wall, the most holy religious site in Judaism.
'When the Jordanians had control of the old city they spat and pissed on the
Wailing Wall. It will happen again when Arafat comes. He is a murderer of
Jews. He is Hitler's right hand and this agreement is against the people and
against the Torah (the Old Testament).
'We are praying against the agreement and praying for the Messiah to come
and solve these problems.'

FT  11 SEP 93 / Japanese business confidence 'at its lowest in 18 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO

<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers' business confidence ebbed to its lowest in 18 years
between May and August this year and service industries' sentiment was at
its most pessimistic ever, the Bank of Japan said yesterday.
The results of the bank's quarterly Tankan survey on business sentiment,
taking in 7,400 companies, were slightly worse than expected and show that
Japan might have slipped into recession over the summer with no prospect of
an early recovery, said economists.
The business confidence index, which measures the balance between the
percentage of companies which see the outlook as good less those which
believe it is bad, stood at -51 for manufacturing industry at the end of
last month. That is the lowest since 1975 and compares with -49 in each of
the previous two quarters. Service industries fell to -41, from -38 in the
previous survey at the end of May.
This latest evidence from what is seen as Japan's most important business
survey increases the likelihood that the central bank will make a
half-percentage point cut in its 2.5 per cent official discount rate some
time this month, said analysts.
It also increases the urgency of the government's economic stimulus package,
details of which will be published next Thursday. Demand is weak. A balance
of 51 per cent of manufacturing companies reported excess supply for their
products and 32 per cent said inventories were too high.
As a result, manufacturers find their ability to dictate prices has
weakened. The index of prices, which measures the balance between those
expecting sales prices to rise against those forecasting a fall, declined by
10 points since May to -32.
A balance of 26 per cent of manufacturers had excess capacity. On average,
manufacturers plan to cut capital investment by 5.9 per cent in the tax year
ending next March, having forecast a smaller 4.4 per cent in the last
survey. The employment outlook is also weak, with a balance of 19 per cent
of all companies believing their workforces are too large.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Health fund planned for silicone implant cases: Dow Corning
proposes Dollars 4.75bn in benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WOMEN with silicone breast implants may be eligible to a share of up to
Dollars 4.75bn in health benefits over a 30-year period under a proposal
being discussed by both sides in litigation over implants.
Manufacturers of implants are facing thousands of lawsuits by women claiming
they cause diseases of the immune system.
Dow Corning, once the world's biggest maker of silicone breast implants
before it withdrew from the business last year, said discussions had
progressed to a point where a proposal had been developed and was under
review.
The Michigan-based company, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and
Corning, said the Dollars 4.75bn benefits would be funded by industry
participants, including manufacturers, raw material suppliers, insurance
carriers, physicians and other healthcare providers. Details of how much
each participant would contribute have yet to be determined.
Mr Gary Anderson, Dow Corning executive vice-president, stressed the
preliminary nature of the proposal. 'There are still many steps to go
through and conditions to be met before a settlement can be implemented.' He
described the proposal as 'essentially a 30-year insurance policy for women
with implants so that they won't have to worry about being protected in the
future.'
After the defendants and trial lawyers agree on a formula for sharing the
settlement, there will be public fairness hearings across the US to ensure
that it is fair to women with implants.
Dow Corning and other manufacturers deny implants are unsafe, although they
have been banned from widespread sale in the US. Bristol-Myers Squibb, a
former manufacturer, said it 'denies all liability and has entered the
discussions to avoid protracted litigation. It should be noted scientific
research has not established a link between implants and disease.'
Dow Corning had already committed Dollars 10m to research the safety of
implants 'and we will probably end up spending Dollars 20m which will not be
part of the proposed fund', said Mr Anderson.
The company said the proposal 'could possibly have a material adverse effect
on the company's consolidated financial position'.
Lawyers representing British women taking legal action against Dow Corning
welcomed the principle of a global settlement, but were unhappy with the
prospect that plaintiffs living outside the US would receive much less
compensation.

75m) private sector loan to modernise Greece's railways, in the latest part
of a drive to calm strains over the country's trade surplus.
This is a fresh development in Japan's six-year-old strategy of trying to
recycle part of its capital surplus in development and aid.
It is the first time the Export-Import bank has guaranteed a loan by private
institutions, under the so-called 'funds for development' scheme, and the
first time a European Community member state has benefited from the scheme.
'This loan to a member of the EC will help improve Japan-EC economic
relations, which are clouded by the trade imbalance,' said the bank.
The bank's guarantee allows the fixed rate loan, by 11 insurance companies,
to have an unusually long maturity, 12 years.
Without the guarantee, the lenders would have been unable to accept the
risk, said Mr Masahiko Agata, special adviser to the governor.
The precursor to this scheme was launched in 1987, with a Dollars 65bn
package of loans to developing countries, seen at the time as an important
gesture to critics of Japan's growing current account surplus.
Of this, the Export-Import Bank of Japan had lent Dollars 23.7bn by the time
the scheme was fully disbursed last June. Lending is untied, in that the
recipients do not have to use the cash to buy Japanese goods, though the
bank specifies that the borrowers must use the money on development
projects.

FT  10 SEP 93 / EC hopes to reform Lome Convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday unveiled plans to overhaul the Lome
Convention, the much-criticised regime governing trade and aid with 69
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC Commissioner responsible for development policy, said it
was vital to introduce tighter controls to counter inefficiency and
corruption, while bolstering democratic reform and the private sector.
Mr Marin, a Spanish Socialist, said the Lome Convention had to be tailored
to the new post-cold war world where Africa was competing with other regions
such as eastern Europe, Russia and Latin America for EC aid.
Mr Marin called for Lome funds to target civil society and strength
democracy, good government and the rule of law. 'It may be unfashionable to
say so, but we need to create a national bourgeoisie in Africa,' he said.
The 1975 Lome Convention grew out of the old Yaounde Convention, where most
of the beneficiaries were French colonies. Britain's entry into the EC
increased the membership in Africa and widened it to the Caribbean and
Pacific, but at the expense of efficiency and coherence. The Fourth Lome
Convention (1990-2000) provides for Ecu12bn (Dollars 14bn) in the form of
grants, soft loans and interest rate rebates over the first five years - a
20 per cent increase on Lome III. But a recent European Parliament report
said only one-third of projects produce results.
Mr Marin's most controversial proposal would involve stopping the automatic
payment of EC aid money to Lome clients.

Cuba took another cautious step towards establishing a mixed economy
yesterday when its communist party government authorised limited, individual
private enterprise in a wide range of trades, crafts and services, agencies
report from Havana.
The move, decreed by President Fidel Castro, lifted a virtual state monopoly
of production, employment and sales in Cuba. Cubans predicted the return of
private vendors and tradespeople who had disappeared after the last brief
relaxation, ended when the usual state control of all economic sectors was
re-imposed.

France's largest farm union, the FNSEA, called for a nationwide day of
protest on September 20 to press the European Community to renegotiate the
Blair House farm trade agreement with the US, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Luc Guyau, the union's leader, said the protest would be on the day EC
foreign and farm ministers were due to discuss the pact in Brussels.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt secretary-general, has warned that reopening the
Blair House draft agreement would endanger a December 15 deadline for
concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation talks. He said
yesterday the talks would be in crisis unless quick solutions were found to
outstanding issues.

FT  10 SEP 93 / European industry 'needs to change cost structure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN industry needs urgently to change its costs structure to compete
internationally and preserve jobs, even though many thousands of jobs will
go as a result of such a reappraisal.
This was the message of the industrial relations chiefs of two leading
European trans-national electronics companies, Philips and Siemens, to a
Centre for European Policy Studies seminar on employment.
Ms Regina Matthisen, international labour relations manager of Philips,
argued that 'we have lived in Europe above our means for too long.' High
wage and non-wage costs, inflexible and short working hours would drive
European industry to relocate in areas such as eastern Europe and China,
where costs were around a tenth or lower.
Mr Uwe Liebig, international labour policy manager at Siemens, argued that
with labour costs and working hours largely cemented in place by
regulations, sacking workers was often European companies' only way out.
'Current laws are such that only jobs are freely disposable,' he said.
Both cited now familiar figures showing most EC wage and social security
costs high above Japanese and US levels, even though Mr Liebig demonstrated
that productivity in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Sweden
remains well above levels in Japan and the US.
Ms Matthisen argued that 'we cannot compete with these enormous differences
in wage costs,' and called for a 'very high amount of flexibility' on wages,
working time, switching of jobs, and in the introduction of much greater
automation. A 'knowledge-intensive' industrial structure will be Europe's
strength, she said, but warned that companies could still get high quality
production out of low cost countries with sometimes lower education
standards.
Mr Liebig said Siemens was not considering shifting production out of Europe
on any scale. But technological advance was lowering the work content of
production, thereby doing away with semi-skilled jobs. At Siemens, these
jobs were largely being replaced by more skilled jobs.
Philips employs 240,000 world-wide, but has shed 170,000 jobs in the last 15
years, including 45,000 in the last three, Ms Matthisen said. Employment at
Siemens, by contrast, has more than doubled since 1960 to 413,000 in 1992,
but Mr Liebig said 'we shall have a little less than 400,000 employees
worldwide' by the end of September.
Officials from the European Commission, which is preparing a White Paper on
the way out of the jobs crisis, said dismantling EC social protection was
not the way forward.

Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, the German aircraft manufacturer, announced
yesterday that it will cut up to 2,800 jobs by the end of 1995 in nine to 10
factories across Germany, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
The company said the 'dramatic' decline in the demand for aircraft had
forced it to cut its workforce of 20,600 by 13 per cent.
The company, which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, itself owned by
Daimler-Benz, reported profits of DM410.8m (Dollars 253.5m) in 1992, down
from DM421.3m the previous year.

FT  10 SEP 93 / German banker rejects state banks privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S leading public sector banker has condemned suggestions that public
sector banks should be privatised as part of the German government's
attempts to reduce the role of the state in German economic life.
Speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday night, Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive
of the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the biggest of the Landesbanken
which act as house banks to Germany's regional governments, said that any
privatisation would endanger the stability and competitiveness of the German
banking industry.
He added that suggestions that privatisation of the banking sector could
raise DM100bn (Dollars 61.7bn) for central and regional government were
incomprehensible: the figure would be considerably lower, and in any case
the one-off benefit to the state from the proceeds would be offset by the
long-term damage to the fabric of society and the economy.
The German banking system is divided into three segments - privately-owned
commercial banks, state sector banks and co-operative banks. Mr Otto
Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democrats party, has been
prominent among those calling for state sector banks to be sold off as part
of the government's commitment to privatisation, outlined last week in a
paper produced by the Economics Ministry.
Although the Landesbanken fulfil duties on behalf of the state governments
which own them, they are free to enter into mainstream commercial lending
business as well. A bank such as WestLB, house bank to the state of
North-Rhine Westphalia, has accumulated extensive industrial holdings and
has played an aggressive role in big business.
It played a key part in Krupp's takeover of rival steelmaker Hoesch last
year and it has also built up a large business in the travel sector, most
recently acquiring the Thomas Cook travel group.
WestLB's activities have drawn sharp criticism from the private banking
sector which complains that the bank is unfairly subsidised by its state
sector owners.
They also complain that the bank's activities fit oddly with the its status
as house bank to the Social Democrat-ruled state of North-Rhine Westphalia.
One result of the three-tier system is that Germany is served by well in
excess of 4,000 credit institutions, which has led to suggestions that the
country is 'over-banked' and that it is likely to be the 'steel industry of
the 1990s' as the banks face the need for drastic restructuring.
However the banking sector is prospering despite the severity of the
recession.

FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in international conglomerate BTR soared to a hefty 23m, its
highest daily total since 1989, as dealers moved to sell the shares after a
cautious statement accompanied the group's results.
The shares fell 17 1/2 to 381 1/2 p, brushing aside a 10 per cent rise in
first-half profits to Pounds 602m, in line with market expectations, after
the company said the outlook 'remains uncertain' for the second half.
Analysts also suggested that there was some unease in the market about the
enhanced scrip dividend alternative and the free warrant issue, both
announced yesterday.
New London Stock Exchange rules likely to exclude Rothmans International and
half of SmithKline Beecham from the FT-SE Actuaries Indices hit the price of
the respective shares.
The changes, devised to plug an advanced corporation tax anomaly, would
imply that investment funds may not automatically buy SmithKline Units or
Rothmans as part of their need to get a full Footsie weighting.
Analysts said that from being 25 per cent underweight in SmithKline because
of extensive US holdings in the stock, UK fund managers might in future be
50 per cent overweight. One disgruntled analyst complained that the rule
changes were 'hardly conducive to an orderly market'.
SmithKline Beecham Units fell 15 to 374p on heavy turnover of 11m and
Rothmans lost 21 to 675p.
A surprise afternoon downgrade for Courtaulds, the chemicals group, left the
shares 16 cheaper at 519p. SG Warburg cut its current year forecast from
Pounds 210m to Pounds 180m as analyst Mr Paul Mylchreest argued that
short-term prospects were worrying, particularly in the heavy chemicals arm
of the business.
Stores issues had a good session, buoyed by optimism over rate cuts and
continuing reports about consumer-led recovery. Boots rose 5 to 498p, Dixons
7 to 231p after an upbeat agm and Marks and Spencer 5 1/2 to 389 1/2 p.
Dull results and the resignation of the finance director left Booker 9 down
at 432p. Northern Foods edged forward 1 1/2 to 281p. Strauss Turnbull was
recommending the stock.
The day's highest volume was in Babcock International, 29m shares being
recorded after the company issued a profits warning. Babcock said it
expected a first-half loss and would not pay an interim dividend due to
higher than anticipated costs on its Pounds 400m contract to supply
equipment to the Drax power station. The shares dropped 8 1/2 to 31 1/2 p,
just above the year's low.
T&amp;N shed 4 1/2 to 205p following a cautious results statement along with
what some in the market called 'unease' about the scrip alternative it
announced at the same time as the results.
Lloyds Bank rose 10 to 555p, with turnover hitting 5.7m shares, on talk of a
buy note from broker Kleinwort Benson and on technical considerations.
Kleinwort's banking team declined to comment.
RTZ strengthened 7 to 725p after announcing a 15 per cent profits increase.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing onward march in the share price of Great Universal Stores -
the stock has risen nearly 7.5 per cent in the past week - was prompting
widespread speculation in the market yesterday.
Perhaps the wildest but strongest rumour at the market opening was that the
chairman of Kingfisher was resigning to join GUS as chief executive  - a
story hotly denied by both camps. However, it had the effect of unsettling
the Kingfisher share price, which fell away sharply and failed to recover in
spite of good news on French interest rates.
Other stories linked to GUS included speculation that its enfranchisement of
its non-voting shares next month might be accompanied by a share buy-back
scheme. This would not be the first time cash-rich GUS has undertaken such a
move, although analysts were sceptical that it would do so just now. Another
rumour suggested that an announcement on a new commercial development was
imminent. GUS 'A' shares advanced 55 to 2158p. Turnover was 850,000.
Kingfisher retreated 9 to 647p.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good results and a cash call from Cadbury Schweppes left the shares steady
at 470p but the market deeply divided over the confectionery group's
prospects. Cadbury intends to use the bulk of the Pounds 324m to be raised
by the rights issue to buy A &amp; W Brands, a soft drinks manufacturer in the
US, a move which complements the group's interest in Dr Pepper, in which it
recently took a 26 per cent stake.
While analysts were united in the view that Cadbury will take full control
of Dr Pepper in the near future, thus becoming the third largest drinks
group in the US, they disagreed over the logic of the group's strategy.
Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull said that even should Cadbury persuade Dr
Pepper on the merits of a takeover, a move which would involve it having to
tap shareholders for even more funds, it would still have to battle for
market share against the market leaders, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
However, Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court said the Cadbury strategy was
'entirely sensible' and that the company was accustomed to competitive
environments the world over. 'Cadbury Schweppes represents one of the best
long-term investments in an otherwise dull sector,' he said.

FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rates boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's decision to reduce its interest rates, which sparked off a wave of
cuts through Europe, prompted share price increases for UK companies with a
big exposure to the Continent.
The boost to industry that lower rates will provide gave particularly a
fillip to the UK's hard-pressed building industry groups. RMC Group, which
has substantial German interests, jumped 28 to 807p. Redland rose 14 to
548p, BPB 6 to 247p and Rugby Group 3 to 276p.
Blue Circle Industries, also active in Europe, received an extra boost from
positive interim figures and the shares advanced 14 to 284p in heavy
turnover of 12m. The company, which reported a 31 per cent jump in profits,
said market conditions in the UK and US were improving.
Housebuilders and property groups also benefited from the hope that UK rates
might now fall further. Bellway moved forward 7 to 449p, Alfred McAlpine 4
to 210p, Great Portland Estates 7 to 213p and Slough Estates 10 to 237p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record volume in Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS group Glaxo stunned the investment community with a generous dividend
payment, prompting a rush of buying that left the shares up 27p at the
close. The rise accounted for 5.32 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. It was
accompanied by turnover of 24m shares, which matched the record volume and
sharp share falls registered in March when Dr Ernest Mario, the former chief
executive, resigned.
Yesterday, Dr Richard Sykes, Dr Mario's replacement, took advantage of an
increase in the company's cash pile to Pounds 1.8bn to flag his first
results presentation with a dividend of 22p, against expectations of around
20p. Glaxo had previously said it would not allow dividend cover to fall
below two times but yesterday's payout took cover to 1.8 times and the
company said it would be prepared to see it fall further.
Analysts who had been very cautious on the stock, including the
pharmaceuticals teams at James Capel and Lehman Brothers, were taken by
surprise.
Capel kept its current year profits forecast at Pounds 1.92bn but raised its
dividend prediction from 23p to 26p a share and moved to a 'hold' from a
'sell' stance. Lehman increased its profits estimate by Pounds 35m to Pounds
1.925bn.
Meanwhile, SG Warburg turned buyer and Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett,
already a buyer on yield considerations, said: 'People have overlooked the
capacity for the company to pay a dividend even when the outlook is
uncertain.'
Glaxo shares raced ahead 40 on the news and consolidated to close a net 27
up at 628p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIDSESSION boost given to the derivatives market by the reduction in
German interest rates soon faded as dealers once again decided to go in for
profit-taking, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, early selling of the September contract on the FT-SE 100 saw it
drift lower to the 3,026. This proved to be a solid support level and
September traded just above that level until the Bundesbank's reduction in
interest rates.
That announcement appeared to surprise the market and the ensuing demand
developed into a squeeze that sent the contract to a day's high of 3,057.
However with a feeling that UK base rates were unlikely to be reduced in the
near future, together with caution about the US markets with the current
weakness in the dollar, traders chose to consolidate earlier gains.
September drifted lower for the rest of the day and closed at 3,039, just a
point ahead of its opening level and at an 8 point premium to the underlying
cash market. Volume was particularly heavy with a substantial amount
generated by rolling forward from September to December. Some 14,864
contracts were dealt in the near month contract and just over 4,000 traded
in December.
Strong activity continued in the traded options and total turnover reached
41,557 lots, though volume in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 10,188 contracts.

FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares lower after an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reduction in Bundesbank interest rates failed yesterday to bring the
buyers back into a UK stock market still focused around company results and
the indications of political disagreement within Mr John Major's government
over tax policies in the November Budget.
Further cuts in rates in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have been widely
discounted in London, where investors still believe that a reduction in UK
base rates may be held back until the autumn Budget.
The timing of the cuts in German discount and Lombard rates, followed by
similar moves elsewhere in continental Europe, came as a mild surprise in
London and share prices bounced from a dull start, replacing a 10-point fall
on the Footsie with a gain of the same proportions.
But while the retail and consumer stocks hung on to an early improvement
prompted by a favourable survey of the distributive trades by the
Confederation of British Industry, the broad range of equities soon turned
back.
The second half of the trading session proved erratic, with the UK market
nervously watching Wall Street, which was a couple of Dow points ahead in UK
hours. Weakness in the US dollar revived caution on the outlook for New York
markets. Volatility in UK stock index futures played a part in moving blue
chip share prices.
At its final reading of 3,031.2, the FT-SE 100 Index was down 4.2 on the
day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which contains many stocks more closely linked
to the domestic economy, gained 6.5 points to 3,468.9. But non-Footsie
stocks made up only about 53 per cent of the day's total business.
Much of the day's trend reflected trading statements from a large number of
leading British companies, which continued to provide a somewhat mixed lead
for the stock market. Companies representing around ten per cent of the
FT-SE market capitaliation reported yesterday. The most outstanding was
Glaxo, which traded very heavily and finally showed a gain worth around plus
5.3 points on the Footsie Index.
Higher profits from Cadbury Schweppes, however, were balanced by a Pounds
324m rights issue, albeit well-discounted to market price. Blue Circle
Industries, Britain's largest cement producer, delivered a highly favourable
report on the UK industry. But statements from both BTR and Babcock
International were less encouraging.
The mixture of company results and interest rate plays boosted Seaq turnover
to 726.8m shares from the 600.4m of the previous session; on Wednesday,
retail or customer business continued to hold up well, returning value of
Pounds 1.27bn. Retail business in London has for a year held comfortably
above the Pounds 1bn daily mark regarded as the basis of a profitable market
for the London-based securities houses.
However, this did nothing to restrain renewed, and apparently stronger,
suggestions that a London agency broker would close its doors today.
Market strategists continued to ask, in the words of the equity team at
Kleinwort Benson, the London based house, ' ..just how far this setback will
go.' Although Kleinwort believes that overseas buying may now have moved on
other markets, it says the downside for London should be limited.

FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steadier with help of
jobless data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AIDED BY some unexpectedly good economic news, US share prices held their
ground yesterday following two days of heavy losses. Secondary markets were
particularly strong, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,589.49. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.85 to 457.50, while the American SE composite
put on 2.30 at 453.38 and the Nasdaq composite gained 6.98 at 737.71. New
York SE volume totalled 258m shares.
After the sharp declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, selling pressure in the
markets appeared to have been exhausted. Sentiment was aided by some rare
good news on the economy: weekly jobless claims fell 10,000 in the first
week of September to 316,000, the lowest level seen since June 1989.
Overseas news was also positive for stocks. The Bundesbank cut German
interest rates, prompting similar rate reductions by other European central
banks. Lower rates in Europe are viewed as bullish for US equities because
they will stimulate growth in European economies and boost demand for US
exports.
Once again, investors ignored events in the bond market, where three days of
big gains and rumours that congress was considering imposing a tax on
foreign holdings of US government securities sparked off heavy
profit-taking. By late afternoon the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue
had risen to 5.957 per cent.
Among individual sectors, bank stocks, which have returned to favour after a
short period in the doldrums, were once again in demand on hopes of
continued improvement in earnings. Chemical rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 43
1/8 , JP Morgan Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 77 5/8 , Citicorp Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 35 3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 .
UAL advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 142 3/8 on news of an improvement in
August traffic figures.
The day's most heavily traded stock was Hanson, which firmed Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 19 1/2 in volume of 41.3m as trading jumped ahead of today's
dividend payout. Glaxo ADRs climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 on news
of a 17 per cent improvement in fiscal 1993 earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks led the way higher, with
Intel moving ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 64 3/4 and Microsoft Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 76 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO rebounded and retrieved the 4,000-point level in busy trading, after
two days of steep declines. The TSE 300 index jumped 56.4 to close at
4,009.3 and rises led falls by 532 to 241 after volume of 62m shares. The
golds sub-index rallied 3.6 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses differ in reaction to
cut in German rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's rate cut had generally been anticipated and bourses saw a
mixture of performances, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT responded to the news from the Bundesbank with a slight fall,
which some traders attributed to the strengthening of the D-Mark against the
US dollar. The DAX index ended the session off 4.48 at 1,880.81, and in the
post-bourse slipped to 1,870.53. Turnover dropped to DM6.8bn from DM7bn.
The market has been undergoing a correction since hitting a peak at the end
of last month, which came at the end of a three-month rally in equities.
Mr James Cornish, European strategist at NatWest Securities in London,
remained positive on the outlook for the German market, both in the short
and long term. With economic fundamentals showing signs of improvement and
expectations that recovery was underway, he said, the prospect for corporate
earnings looked good through 1994 and 1995. He remained fully weighted in
the German market, he said.
Among the stocks, Daimler lost DM9 to DM718.50, Siemens fell by DM2 to DM658
and Volkswagen by DM2.10 to DM360.80.
PARIS was disappointed by the lack of a cut in the intervention rate, in
spite of an easing in the 5-10 day rate. The market is looking for the
authorities to make a move on the former by Monday at the latest.
The CAC-40 index, which at one point had risen to 2,146, closed down 20.69
or 1 per cent at 2,108.75. Turnover was moderate at FFr4.6bn.
The recent batch of disappointing corporate results was also affecting
investor sentiment.
There were some large falls among index stocks, with Legrand down FFr269 or
5.5 per cent at FFr4,625 ahead of interim results which are due today.
Canal Plus lost FFr57 or 4.4 per cent to FFr1,248 on a brokers downgrade,
while dollar weakness affected the likes of Rhone Poulenc , off FFr5.10 to
FFr147, and Euro Disney, down FFr1.80 at FFr62.35.
AMSTERDAM rose slightly after several days of declines, the CBS Tendency
index up 0.6 at 124.5.
Amev gained FL 3.30 to Fl 72.50 after parent group Fortis issued good half
year results, while Bols Wessanen lost 20 cents to Fl 42.00 on disappointing
interim profits.
ZURICH registered some disappointment at the absence of a cut in Swiss
interest rates and the SMI index fell 15.8 to 2,382.1.
Nestle registered shares eased SFr2 to SFr1,070 in spite of a 6 per cent
rise in first half consolidated net profits, which was at the top end of
expectations.
MILAN clawed its way back from a weak opening after the Bank of Italy cut
the discount rate and the Comit index finished 1.54 easier at 592.64.
The market had opened under pressure from a flood of sales by individual
investors following local press reports, later denied by the finance
minister, that the government was considering reintroducing capital gains
taxation on share trades.
The Bank of Italy's move on rates came as little surprise in the wake of the
German reduction, although many investors had expected the authorities to
hold back an announcement until the government won parliamentary approval
for its 1994 budget plans in a vote expected after the market had closed.
Among banks, San Paolo attracted a number of large buy orders which took the
price L900 or 8.7 per cent higher to L11,190.
Ferruzzi continued on its idiosyncratic way, climbing another L45 or 9.9 per
cent to L497.75, for a rise this week of 46 per cent.
STOCKHOLM strengthened during the session with the Affarsvarlden general
index rising 9.7 to 1,281.8 in turnover fo SKr1.4bn.
ATHENS fell 6.9 per cent as it became clear that the government had, after
all, lost its majority in parliament and an early election was called. The
general index fell 59.3 to 801.85.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London said: 'Over the longer term, the
economic fundamentals will not change greatly, irrespective of who is in
power. There is bound to be nervousness and the market will fall further,
but that will provide opportunities for investors to start buying selected
stocks again.'
The FT-SE Eurotrack indices committee yesterday approved the following
constituent changes to the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, to take effect on
Monday, September 20. Additions: Nokia (ordinary), AG Finance, Delhaize,
Sandvik A. Deletions: Montedison, Gambro B, Ciba Geigy (bearer), Banca di
Roma.

FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower as Manila
soars to record
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SELLING by investment trusts and European investors pushed share prices
lower and the Nikkei average lost ground for the fourth consecutive trading
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 92.61 at 20,825.58 as many investors remained on
the sidelines ahead of today's settlement of September futures and options
contracts, and release of the tankan, or quarterly report on business
sentiment.
The Nikkei moved up to a day's high of 20,943.79 in the morning session, but
fell to the day's low of 20,756.28 just before the close. Steel and oil
shares were sold after the announcements of gloomy corporate news from
leading companies in the sectors earlier in the week. However, some traders
blamed the popularity of the second section and over-the-counter market,
which was attracting funds away from the first section.
Volume contracted to 250m shares from 297m, staying below 300m shares for
the fourth day in a row. Declines outscored advances by 592 to 362, with 202
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 6.48
to 1,676.34, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.82 to 1,286.91.
The increase in new listings on the second section and OTC market has been
supporting activity in the smaller markets. On Wednesday, turnover on the
OTC market came to Y55.5bn, rising above Y50bn for the first time since June
1991. Traders said that Promise, the consumer finance company which became
listed on the OTC on Tuesday, attracted investors.
Steel issues weakened on earnings fears, following Nippon Steel's downward
profits revision on Tuesday. Four leading steel makers are scheduled to
announce similar revisions today. Nippon Steel fell Y18 to Y342, NKK lost Y5
to Y294 and Kobe Steel retreated Y8 to Y300.
Oil companies continued to lose ground following reports of Nikko Kyodo's
liquidation of its US subsidiary. Nikko Kyodo dropped Y13 to Y497 and Tonen
Y40 to Y1,590.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y15,000 to Y915,000 after its decision
to cut long distance rates, while KDD, the international telecom company,
surrendered Y100 to Y12,700. After the market closed KDD announced a cut in
its overseas call rates.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 122.04 to 22,749.04 in volume of 38.5m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical shed Y90 to Y5,620 on profit-taking.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were mixed.
MANILA soared to a record high, the composite index rising 25.49 to
1,911.77, with the outlook for PLDT providing the spur. PLDT climbed 65
pesos to 1,410 pesos.
SEOUL was spurred sharply higher by aggressive buying by individual
investors. The composite index rose 12.54 to 696.14 in turnover that picked
up to Won428.9bn. Renewed rumours of a currency reform, which the government
has strongly denied, and anticipation of economic boosting measures
contributed to the day's gain.
HONG KONG saw moderate losses at the close, after a plunge in index futures
helped to erase solid early gains. The Hang Seng index shed 20.37 to
7,586.76, after hitting an intraday record of 7,663.63.
AUSTRALIA continued its downward slide, undermined by weaker gold and
resource stocks, a lack of overseas interest and the sharp overnight fall on
Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index finished 8.1 lower at 1,931.4 in light
turnover of ADollars 398.4m.
NEW ZEALAND was hit by profit-taking, which left the NZSE-40 capital index
8.06 easier at 1,992.29.
BOMBAY picked up as the government sought to end the uncertainty that has
beset the market in recent days. The BSE index rose 82.30 to 2,662.54 in a
session shortened to one hour from the normal two.

FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Putting some numbers on David and
Goliath - New stock indices that show the relative performance of large and
small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the 1987 stock market crash, there have been some striking differences
in the share price movements of the biggest companies and their medium and
smaller-sized rivals.
This trend is highlighted by new Large Cap and Medium-Small Cap series which
are being calculated from this week as part of the FT-Actuaries World
Indices. The new indices are calculated by Goldman Sachs and NatWest
Markets, who produce the World Index series in conjunction with the FT and
the UK's Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The new indices split companies in the FT-Actuaries World Indices by market
capitalisation. The Large Cap series covers companies that make up the
largest 75 per cent of each country's market capitalisation. The
Medium-Small Cap series, covering the remaining 25 per cent, provides
performance information on the medium and smaller-size companies within each
country.
The chart of the overall World Large Cap and Medium-Small Cap indices shows
the new indices moving closely in parallel in the years immediately before
the 1987 stock market crash. After that, there was a period of sustained
underperformance by the largest companies. Then, from the summer of 1990,
larger companies did better. From the end of that year the two indices moved
sideways, in relative terms, before a pick-up in the smaller companies'
index from the beginning of 1993.
Although, in very broad terms, this pattern is shared by most of the
individual countries that make up the World index, there are big differences
in how extreme the movements have been. In the US, for example, the
outperformance by smaller companies after 1987 was less than in the world as
a whole, and the subsequent underperformance by this group was much larger.
The relative recovery by the US Medium-Small Cap index started sooner,
however, and has gone further than in the world as a whole.
In Germany, smaller companies outperformed consistently throughout
1986-1990, and since then the reversal of trend has been weak. There has
been little sign, as yet, of a reversion to outperformance by smaller
companies.
In Japan, as the chart shows, there was a brief period of outperformance by
larger companies in late 1986 and early 1987. Since then, however, the
pattern has been similar to that in Germany: small-company outperformance
until 1990, followed by weak outperformance by larger companies, with little
sign of the market switching back to favouring smaller ones.
There are a number of possible reasons for differences in the relative
performances of companies of different size. In general, small companies are
more exposed to the performance of the domestic economy than their larger
rivals, and less subject to the impact of currency movements. They are also
more vulnerable to recession. Periods of localised economic hardship are
thus more likely to affect small companies than larger ones.
Investors have better information about larger companies, and the markets in
their shares are typically more liquid. International investors, in
particular, often concentrate only on the very largest companies within any
individual economy, so in those markets where swings in international
investor sentiment are important, this may translate into differential
performance by larger companies.
It is hoped to publish a weekly summary of the performance of the Large Cap
and Medium-Small Cap indices in the FT, probably each Monday. Publication
will start once the necessary technical arrangements have been made.
Further details of the two indices can be obtained from Mark Zurack and
Barbara Mueller of Goldman Sachs in New York (tel: 212-902 6777) and Symon
Bradford of NatWest Securities in Edinburgh (tel: +44 (0)31-243 4258).

FT  10 SEP 93 / Money Markets: A gloomy mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's  1/2 percent-age point cut in its official interest rates
yesterday did not generate an expectation of further German easing in
European cash and futures markets, writes James Blitz.
The German central bank reduced its discount and Lombard rates to 6.25 per
cent and 7.25 per cent respectively. More importantly, the repo rate was
lowered to 6.70 per cent for next week's money market operation,
re-establishing a differential of around 50 basis points between the repo
rate and the official rate floor.
Yesterday's move was followed by a succession of official rate cuts across
Europe. But the surprise was that cash and futures markets were downbeat
about the news.
The September Euromark contract declined 3 basis points to close at 93.48,
because the repo cut will make little difference to the cost of three-month
D-Marks by the time the contract expires next week. The December contract
shed 6 basis points to finish at 94.08.
It may be that dealers saw yesterday's moves as purely technical, leaving
little hope for interest rate cuts over the next six weeks. The move may
also have been heavily discounted by German money market dealers who, on
Wednesday, accepted surpris-ingly few repo bids at the prevailing rate of
6.80 per cent in money market operations.
Conditions in the German market were very tight yesterday, with call money
still hovering at 7.52 per cent. Some institutions will be able to borrow
cash from the Bundesbank at the new discount rate today.
In France, the reduction in the five to 10-day lending rate to 7.75 per cent
was seen as a disappointment because it only provides the rate ceiling. The
December French franc contract had peaked at 94.13 when the Bundesbank news
came through, but fell back to close at 93.98.
Sterling interest rate futures fell sharply after Mr Howard Davies, the
director general of the Confederation of British Industry, was reported as
saying that the UK did not need a rate cut now. The December contract fell 6
points to close at 94.36.
Conditions in the cash market were very easy after most of a Pounds 2.4bn
shortage was removed in the early round of dealing. Three-month money lost
1/16 percentage point to end at 5 7/8 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Another fall for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, losing more than two
pfennigs, in spite of the Bundesbank's decision to ease its discount rate by
1/2 percentage point, writes James Blitz.
A few months ago, it would have been extraordinary to see the US currency
drop so far on the same day as a sharp easing in Bundesbank monetary policy.
But the mood towards the dollar has changed radically in the last two weeks,
and more than a few analysts wonder whether the currency now has a strong
downside.
The US unit fell to DM1.5928 before closing at DM1.5970, against a previous
DM1.6190. In New York it ended trading at DM1.5990. The dollar may have
depreciated because yesterday's Bundesbank move appears to have been well
discounted by some dealers. Less well informed players may have been
surprised that the US currency did not rise on the German move, and
panicked.
But in the background lie all the factors that make dollar appreciation hard
to envisage in the short term. Fund managers who thought this would be the
'year of the dollar' are heavily overweight in the currency; there is a
growing belief that the German recession has bottomed out; and, above all,
there has been disappointment in recent US economic indicators.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank, believes that DM1.58 to the
dollar is a done deal. 'If we do not get a quick bounce after that, all the
medium term players will panic and you will see it go a lot lower,' he said.
Currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were barely helped by the
German move. Against the D-Mark, the French franc ended at FFr3.525 from a
previous FFr3.519, the Danish krone fell to a close of DKr4.155 from
DKr4.130, and the Belgian franc finished at BFr21.75 from a previous
BFr21.76. The weakest and strongest currencies were divided by 9.21
percentage points at the close, a new record since the August currency
crisis.
There was no sign yesterday that Europe was decoupling from German monetary
policy. But the weakness in European currencies may have been due to a
perception that France, Belgium and Denmark were no longer doggedly pursuing
a high interest rate policy to defend their currencies.
Sterling tried to break through the DM2.50 level on news of the German rate
cut, as dealers took the view that lower rates in Europe gave a better
looking premium to the pound. But the UK currency failed to do so and, in a
fate similar to the dollar's, declined sharply to close at DM2.4775 from a
previous DM2.4950.
The move surprised some dealers. The Confederation of British Industry had
reported another increase in retail sales in August earlier in the day,
following similar improvements in June and July - and added that this was
accompanied by the lowest year-on-year rise in shop prices for 10 years.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather slashes US maize crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLOODS in the US Midwest and drought in the south-east have slashed US maize
production to three-quarters of last year's levels, the Agriculture
Department said yesterday.
In its latest crop report the department estimated maize production at
7.23bn bushels compared with last year's record of 9.48bn. Yields were
estimated at 113.1 bushels per acre - 18.3 bushels below last year's record
of 131.4.
The weather did less to reduce wheat production. The department estimated
this year's output at 2.49bn bushels compared with 2.46bn last year.
However, there have been widespread reports of disease problems in the Red
River Valley of both Minnesota and North Dakota, as well as damage caused by
moisture in South Dakota. The National Association of Wheat Growers has
written to Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, to express concern about
'serious wheat quality problems'.
The group is requesting establishment of a feed wheat purchase and donation
programme. It has also warned that damage may begin to appear in export
cargoes.
Despite the damage this year's wheat crop is expected to swell surplus
stocks. Because China and Russia have been largely absent from the world
market, the USDA has cut its wheat export projection to 1.35m bushels. The
figure last year was 50m.
US soyabean production will be an estimated 1.9bn bushels, about 13 per cent
below last year and the lowest output since 1988.
Cotton production is estimated at 17.9m bales, a rise of 10 per cent on last
year despite lack of rain in cotton-growing regions.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC's 'naive' aluminium import
curbs attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW over restrictions imposed by the European Commission on aluminium
imports to the Community from the Commonwealth of Independent States flared
up again yesterday as Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the
world's biggest mining group, launched a scathing attack.
He said the EC's imposition of quotas was 'naive, ineffective and an
irrelevance. One might just as well have attempted to prevent the recent
Mississippi floods with a child's index finger'. He pointed out: 'Supplies
of any fungible commodity are indivisible.'
The commission announced at the begining of August that the surge in CIS
aluminium imports had 'seriously damaged' EC producers and that imports to
the end of November would be limited to 60,000 tonnes. This would give some
breathing space for further negotiations.
At presentations associated with the publication of RTZ's half-year results,
Mr Crowson also added his voice to those who had suggested that the level of
metals prices in coming months mainly depended on the producers. More output
cuts were needed if prices were to rise, he argued.
He pointed out that CIS exports of all metals had levelled off but warned
that they would persist at present high levels. The 'clamour' of some metal
producers for trade restrictions was understandable but represented 'a
failure to live up to changed realities'. Because of the collapse of the
former Soviet Union, those realities included 'permanent and irreversible
shifts in patterns of demand, relative costs and production'.
Economic pressures were forcing western lead and zinc miners to cut
production but smelters had so far been insulated. 'Their insulation is now
disintegrating rapidly,' Mr Crowson suggested. Cuts in aluminium production
had not been enough to restore the market to supply/demand balance, let
alone reduce stocks.
There was a very good economic case to be made for Japanese copper smelters
to cut output, but it would be unwise to bank on this happening.
He said most metals prices appeared to be near their cyclical low points.
'The speed of any subsequent upturn depends partly on the course of economic
activity, but mainly on how suppliers themselves react in coming months.'
Discussions about the Lihir Island gold project between the government of
Papua New Guinea, RTZ and RTZ's potential joint venture partners were
proceeding amicably, said Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive. 'We are
hopeful that a satisfactory conclusion will prove possible,' he added. RTZ's
proposal to sell part of its 80 per cent stake to Venezuelan Goldfields, a
Canadian company, seemed in jeopardy last month after the PNG government
suggested RTZ was behaving in a high-handed manner and threatened to take a
50 per cent holding in Lihir, the biggest western gold deposit outside South
Africa, instead of 30 per cent as previously expected.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC 'to freeze green rates'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission would last night be freezing the 'green' currency
rates rates at which Community-guaranteed farm prices are translated into
national currencies until the end of September, a commission official said
yesterday afternoon, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'There will be no green rate devaluations or revaluations in September,' he
said.
The commission's decision, which followed backing for the move by the EC
agrimonetary committee earlier in the day, would provide some short-term
stability in farm trade, the official said, adding that the situation would
be reviewed before the end of the month.
Farm trade became unstable after all EC currencies were regarded as floating
when fluctuation bands for most units were widened on August 1 in the wake
of the exchange rate mechanism debacle.
The three- and 10-day reference periods for calculating green rates had been
temporarily abandoned and the rates fixed on the basis of exchange rates in
the last 10 days of August, the official explained.
The decision followed pressure from the German government, which was worried
that a possible strengthening of the D-Mark would cause a further cut in
prices for its farmers.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK feed cake sliced into bigger
portions - The three top producers now have 52 per cent of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CATTLE, pigs and poultry may not know it, but the business of feeding
them is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
'You've got to have animal feed plants that are like ice cream factories or
bakeries in terms of their standards of hygiene and efficiency,' says Mr
Paul Kirk, executive director in charge of agribusiness at Dalgety, the food
and agriculture group.
That is one reason for the growing concentration of the compound animal feed
market in the hands of national producers. The latest move came last week
when Dalgety announced that it was paying Pounds 15.7m for Unigate's Oldacre
business, the largest regionally-based manufacturer, to take its share of
the national market from 17 per cent to 21 per cent.
This puts it neck-and-neck with BOCM Pauls, the company formed last year by
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield when it merged its own subsidiary, Pauls Agriculture,
with the BOCM Silcock animal feeds business it bought from Unilever for
Pounds 67m.
BOCM Pauls has 22 per cent of the market, putting the share of the national
producers, including J. Bibby in third place, at about 52 per cent.
Industry analysts say the Dalgety acquisition has raised a question mark
over Bibby, part of the South African Barlow Rand group, given that it is
now a long way behind its nearest rivals in a shrinking industry.
Some of the independent regional millers and co-operatives that share the
rest of the market are also likely to come under pressure.
Hygiene standards are becoming increasingly onerous and putting the squeeze
on smaller producers, according to Mr Kirk. 'The amount of food safety
legislation applying to animal feeds is larger than that which applies to
human food,' he says.
The industry is likely to gravitate towards manufacturers that are either
big enough to benefit from economies of scale or small enough to hold niche
markets, says Mr Kirk. 'Being stuck in the middle might not be the most
comfortable place to be.'
European Community milk quotas, introduced in 1984, have helped to make the
animal feed market stagnant, and last year's reforms of the common
agricultural policy, designed to cut farm over-production, are expected to
restrict future growth.
'That doesn't mean there isn't a good business opportunity in a market
that's contracting, provided there is rationalisation,' says Mr George Paul,
chief executive of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield. 'What we're aiming to do is to be
significantly the most economic producers of feed, running a small number of
quite large modern mills at as close to design capacity as we can.'
BOCM Pauls is due to complete a sweeping rationalisation programme by the
end of this year. It has closed 13 mills, axed 600 jobs - 25 per cent of the
workforce - and increased the average capacity of its remaining 20 mills
from 75,000 tonnes a year to 120,000 tonnes. It is investing Pounds 10m in
upgrading production.
Dalgety has added Oldacre's eight mills to its existing 19 mills. Mr Kirk
says the purchase is a good geographical fit with the existing business,
although industry observers expect some rationalisation here too, albeit
more limited.
This year the company is spending Pounds 14m on replacing machinery,
upgrading older plants and increasing capacity, which is now an average of
nearly 100,000 tonnes per mill.
The size of the two market leaders will enable them to spread their research
and development costs at a time when discerning consumers are forcing
changes all the way down the food chain.
'The large retailers are increasingly interested in the methods of
production of what ends up on their shelves,' says Mr Martin Wood, BOCM
Pauls managing director, at the company's Ipswich headquarters. Supermarkets
now want to know the proportion of lean meat in broiler chickens, for
example, or the protein content of milk.
At the same time, UK farmers need to cut costs to compete with successful
exporters like Denmark and the Netherlands. That means, for example, using a
feed that will enable the delivery of as many cattle as possible to the
abattoir on the right day and at the right weight, he says.
To meet these demands, BOCM Pauls is converting some of its mills from
general feed production to diets specially designed for cattle, pigs or
poultry. Its 350-strong sales force has also become 'species-specific'.
The newly merged company had a disappointing first half performance because
it had failed to secure adequate advance supplies of raw materials before
the pound was devalued upon quitting the EC's exchange rate mechanism last
September.
The impact was felt not only in costlier imports, which account for 30 per
cent of its raw materials, but also in the price of vital home-grown
cereals. EC support prices are fixed in European currency units, so the
sterling-denominated price of UK cereals shot up by some 20 per cent as the
pound plummeted.
That cast a shadow over the merger.
But the pound's devaluation was not all bad news as it gave British farmers
 -including the company's 10,000 customers - an unexpected and welcome boost
to profits. That has increased confidence, particularly in the dairy sector,
where farmers are also being wooed by milk buyers and processors in the
run-up to next year's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board's monopoly.
The immediate challenge for the market leaders will be to hold on to their
new slice of the cake. BOCM Pauls lost 2 percentage points of market share
to its rivals during its merger, but analysts expect the Dalgety acquisition
to cause less of an upheaval because Oldacre is smaller and likely to
require less integration.
It should also soon become clear whether price competition is on the cards,
as manufacturers begin to strike contracts with farmers for the winter feed
season.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: ANC offers miners hope of
exchange control relaxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AFRICAN National Congress yesterday raised the prospect that a new
government might relax exchange controls to encourage investment by South
African companies in the region, especially in the mining sector.
Speaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg yesterday Mr Trevor Manuel,
head of the ANC's department of economic planning, said the ANC was
'considering the possibility of creating a special window for investments in
the region'.
He said the ANC was anxious to stimulate local mining companies to invest in
the region and thus to assist in its economic revival.
Existing exchange control regulations make it very difficult for South
African companies to finance investments beyond its borders. Companies have
to convince the Reserve Bank (central bank), which administers exchange
control, that there will be a virtually immediate benefit to the country
from any such investment.
The ANC - likely to be the largest party in a future government - has
acknowledged that no such change could be expected before the second half of
1994, and even that may be an ambitious target. Although, as one bank
official acknowledged, South Africa has a 'soft spot' for Africa, the
selective relaxation of exchange controls for South Africans, while foreign
lenders still find some of their loans subject to a sovereign debt repayment
scheme, would be controversial. And while the ANC clearly feels a debt to
its neighbours, all of whom suffered to some extent from South Africa's
destabilisation policies in the past, it may have difficulty convincing the
business community that the national interest is best served by favouring
regional investment.
In a speech outlining the ANC's view of the future of mining in South
Africa, and on the continent, Mr Manuel said the ANC was 'committed to
maintaining the international position of the (mining) sector and to
creating conditions for guaranteeing the high levels of investment needed to
replace depleting reserves'.
He said that the ANC recognised that mining was a high-risk industry and
that investors required 'above average' guarantees if they were to be
attracted. The ANC was planning a review of the system of access to mineral
rights in an attempt to encourage investment, he added.
'Mineral rights need to be freed up, but this needs to be done in such a way
as still to guarantee the investor the right to mine with adequate tenure.
The fiscal terms need to be stable and the investor must be given access to
foreign exchange, both for imported inputs and the repatriation of profits.'
The ANC, Mr Manuel added, was also committed to 'guaranteeing the investor a
stable economic environment, including guarantees against nationalisation
without compensation'.
Mr Manuel did not lay much emphasis on the 'responsibilities' of the
investor, other than to note that the legacy of apartheid in the industry
would have to be addressed through training of the local population. 'We
hope that we will see much greater black South African participation in
ownership and the higher paid positions.'
He endorsed the conventional wisdom that the future of the local mining
industry lay in the route of beneficiation, or adding value, to minerals.
Examples suggested were stainless steel and aluminium kitchenware and
cutlery.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani cotton fears ease

PAKISTAN'S CENTRAL cotton committee - the country's largest government
backed body for research - expects this year's crop to reach the target of
12m bales, despite recent reports of a leaf curl virus attack and a feared
locust invasion.
The latest assessment comes amid growing concerns over the future of crops,
especially as fears run high ahead of a fresh entry of locust swarms from
Indian Rajasthan, next week.
Pakistan's cotton crop suffered a shortfall of about 3m bales last year,
because of widespread devastation caused by floods, heavy rains and a
similar virus attack.
Mr Iftikhar Afzal, vice president of the committee, said this week that the
cotton crop in the Southern province of Sindh has been better than expected.
As a result, the province is expected to produce up to 1.8m bales, 20 per
cent above target.
In Punjab, where the bulk of the country's cotton is planted, there may be a
slight shortfall from the target of 10.5m bales. Recent rains there have
brought down temperatures and prevented the virus from flaring up, with the
result that earlier estimates of losses have been reduced.
Despite the reassuring assessments, the final crop output will depend on the
extent to which Pakistan is able to control the locust attack, officials
say.
'We are doing everything to save the crop. If we are unable, the
consequences can be devastating. But we have been able to control quite a
lot of activity on the locust,' said Mr Afzal. Other officials say,
moreover, that farmers are better prepared this year in applying pesticides,
based on their experience last year.

The Australian Federal Government accepted all the main recommendations of
the Garnaut Wool Industry Review Committe, appointed in April to consider
the wool crisis. The major wool consuming countries have expressed for
stockpile disposal caused particular anxienty, but the Australian Government
has only relented to the extent of postponing their introduction until July
1994. The wool market itself is firm or slightly dearer this week mainly as
a result of Chinese buying for early shipment. The AWC market indicator
reached 418 cents yesterday, against 411 a week before.

The London Commodity Exchange's robusta market COFFEE recovered from a weak
start yesterday to be about unchanged by midday. And futures values surged
to fresh 2 1/2 -year highs in the afternoon after the New York arabica price
broke through stubborn resistance at 80 cents a lb for the near December
future position. London's November position touched Dollars 1,300 a tonne
before closing at Dollars 1,297, up Dollars 29 on the day. 'The volume in
London has not been all that great,' said one trader, 'we're just following
the lead of New York.' The GOLD price also recovered from a modest early
fall, as the German Bundesbank's discount rate cut improved sentiment. By
the close the price was showing a gain from Wednesday of Dollars 2.40 at
Dollars 354.15 a troy ounce. 'Gold and German interest rates tend to work in
an inverse relationship,' explained James Capel's bullion analyst, Mr Jon
Bertheil. COPPER prices ended easier after an active day, as nearby premiums
narrowed in response to the LME's move on Wednesday to limit the one-day
premium so as to relieve the supply squeeze that has persisted for some
weeks.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: Enjoy an opera or ballet for only Pounds 10 - The new
ROH season's programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, is, of course, home base for The Royal
Ballet, and many participants in the FT-Royal Opera House offer of a ticket
to Covent Garden for just Pounds 10 will be motivated by the chance to see
one of the world's leading dance companies in action.
The Royal Ballet is emerging from a fallow period into an exciting era. It
is building up its company in readiness for the move to the modernised Opera
House promised for later in the decade, but already the stars are emerging,
the names the balletomanes love to follow: Viviana Durante, Sylvie Guillem,
Darcey Bussell, Fiona Chadwick, and now Leanne Benjamin, as leading
ballerinas, and, among the men, Jose Manuel Carreno, Jonathan Cope, Zoltan
Solymosi, Irek Mukhamedov, and Bruce Sansom.
The only new full length production of the season, The Sleeping Beauty, will
be premiered during The Royal Ballet's tour of the United States, and
overseas commitments mean that there will be much less ballet than opera at
the The Royal Opera House this season, perhaps just one hundred performances
as against over 150 of opera. But the programme planned is popular and with
broad appeal.
It starts on October 23rd with a mixed programme of four contemporary
ballets, two of which are world premieres, one is new to Covent Garden, and
the fourth is the eagerly awaited re-working of Kenneth MacMillan's 1984
ballet, Different Drummer. In a way the programme is a tribute to MacMillan,
The Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, who died last year. The new works
are by two of his prodigies, nineteen year old Matthew Hart, his first
ballet for the Company, and William Tuckett, both of whom came through the
Royal Ballet Choreographic Group. The UK premiere is Herman Schmerman, by
the Frankfurt based choreographer William Forsythe, which has Versace
contributing to the costume designs, and a promised appearance by principal
guest artist Sylvie Guillem. These highly individual works will find The
Royal Ballet on points but refreshingly modern in approach.
Then comes one of The Royal Ballet's most enduring favourites, Kenneth
MacMillan's version of Romeo and Juliet, danced to Prokofiev's inspired
music, and regarded as MacMillan's masterwork. Although The Royal Ballet
cannot guarantee appearances by dancers far in advance (they are so accident
prone) Leanne Benjamin is expected to make her debut as Juliet in some
performances, and Darcey Bussell is also expected to dance the role.
The Royal Ballet is celebrating Christmas in style this year with a rush of
performances of Tales of Beatrix Potter, which was staged a year ago to
intense popular acclaim, even if some of the critics were more reticent in
their praise. This re-incarnation for Beatrix Potter's ever popular animals
is brought to the stage by The Royal Ballet's director Anthony Dowell and
danced to Frederick Ashton's original choreography. Some matinee
performances will be mounted especially for younger children. In the same
programme is Ballet Imperial, music by Tchaikovsky, choreography by
Balanchine, and in terms of excitement and design all you expect from a
classical ballet.
This festive double bill runs in tandem with another Christmas favourite,
Nutcracker, as much a part of the season as The Messiah and the pantomime.
Tchaikvoksy's music, Julia Trevelyan Oman's designs, Peter Wright's
production, with its impressive special effects: this is the perfect
introduction to the ballet.
In contrast Mayerling, choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan to the music of
Liszt, is a much more dramatic, indeed tragic, ballet. It tells, with social
realism, the story of the fatal romance between Crown Prince Rudolph, heir
to the Imperial throne of Austria, and the 17 year old Mary Vestera, (danced
some nights by the promising young Gillian Revie), which ends in death for
them both at Mayerling. The Royal Ballet intends to use this production to
show off the progress of some of its younger dancers alongside the
principals.
There follows a particularly strong Triple Bill. The Dream was Frederick
Ashton's working of Mendelssohn's incidental music to A Midsummer Nights
Dream, and among the dancers taking the roles of King and Queen of the
Fairies will be Bruce Sansom and Viviana Durante. In the same evening you
can see another work by Ashton. A Month in the Country is based on Turgenev
and has suitably atmospheric music by Chopin. The Triple Bill ends with
David Bintley's most recent work for Covent Garden, Tombeaux, which is
designed by Jasper Conran.
Don Quixote was first unveiled last year, with the choreography re-worked by
Mikhail Baryshnikov on Petipa's original, and the staging handled by Anthony
Dowell. It is a very stylish looking ballet and the public loved it much
more than the critics. Darcey Bussell is expected to make her debut as
Kitri.
The Royal Ballet dances one more programme before it disappears to New York
for its 1994 summer tour. It is a Triple Bill, which will feature a new work
by Ashley Page; Glen Tetley's La Ronde, with music by Korngold; and
Balanchine's Agon, danced to the music of Stravinsky. It brings to an end a
Royal Ballet season, designed to confirm the recent improvements and to
establish a new generation of dancers in the public's affection. It should
thrill the Pounds 10 punters.
But participants to the offer also get the chance to see another dance
company at the Royal Opera House: the Birmingham Royal Ballet. This is the
former Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet which has moved to Birmingham, changed
its name, and enjoyed a tremendnous new lease of life. It has settled in so
quickly that it is already winning accolades and awards for its
performances. In March it brings the latest work by David Bintley,
MacMillan's most likely successor as leading British choreographer, to
London. Sylvia, based on a Greek legend, has been a favourite subject in the
dance world for over a century. Delibes provided the music for a famous
French 19th century version, which was choreographed by Frederick Ashton for
Covent Garden in the 1950s. Bintley uses much of Delibe's romantic music in
his fresh and modern interpretation, which still finds Eros triumphant at
the happy ending. The ballet is premiered in Birmingham next month and
promises to be the highlight of the season.
Birmingham Royal Ballet is also presenting a Triple Bill which will be of
great interest to London ballet fans since it gives them their first chance
to see the company in Balanchine's popular Serenade, danced to Tchaikovsky's
Serenade for Strings. Also in the programme will be two other works with
American links, Agnes de Mille's dramatic Fall River Legend, and the rousing
Elite Syncopations, danced to the Ragtime tunes of Scott Joplin.
The general director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,is Jeremy
Isaacs. His philosophy is simple. 'The thing that makes the whole job
worthwhile for me is to come out of the stage door and bump into people in
Floral Street with happy faces, who've enjoyed what they've seen and heard,
and are reeling around with the happiness of it.' This is the kind of
programme which should enable Mr Isaacs to enjoy many such encounters.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: European prices volatile after Bundesbank
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bonds were volatile after the Bundesbank's latest round of easing,
which triggered rate cuts in France, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy and
Belgium. After an initial jump on the news, most bond markets weakened
during the afternoon.
'There was a feeling this was the last easing for a while,' said Mr Andy
Bevan, head of fixed-income research at Bear Stearns. He now expects most
European markets to consolidate after their recent rallies.
Traders were also disappointed by the Bundesbank's decision to set
fixed-rate repos at 6.70 per cent, only 10 basis points below this week's
level. This indicated that German rate declines will continue to be very
gradual.
Still, 'once the dust settles, people will realise we're back on the
rate-cutting road,' said Mr Carl Holt, head of trading at ABN-Amro. He
expects yield curves across Europe to steepen as investors prepare for
further easing in Germany, where inflation and money supply data are
expected to improve in coming months.
The German bund future fell  1/4 point after the Bundesbank's announcement,
then rose about  1/2 point. It finally closed slightly lower on the day.
The larger-than-expected half-point cut in German rates initially put
pressure on bond prices. But traders were soon heartened by the tiny
repo-rate cut which indicated that the Bundesbank was not accelerating its
easing process while inflation and money supply growth were still above
target.
'Keeping the repo at 6.70 per cent was the best thing they could have done
for the long end,' said the head bund trader at a Frankfurt bank. Still, he
said that investors should take profits in 10-year bonds and move to shorter
maturities which may offer greater gains. 'Some time next year I expect the
discount rate to be around 4 per cent, but long yields will probably still
be around 6 per cent,' he said.
FRENCH government bonds initially rallied on the German rate cut, but then
dropped on disappointment over the extent of the French easing. By lowering
its five to 10-day repo rate to 7 3/4 from 10 per cent but leaving its
intervention rate unchanged at 6 3/4 per cent, the Bank of France 'put us
back at pre-ERM crisis levels, but no more,' said a dealer. In the event,
OATs recouped most of their losses to end little changed.
UK GILTS eased in line with other European markets, but rate speculation did
not spill across the Channel. 'What happens to continental rates in advance
of November 30 is more or less irrelevant to UK rates,' said Mr Kevin Adams,
UK bond strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The UK budget for next year is
due to be announced on that date.
THREE days of surging US bond prices came to an abrupt end yesterday when
rumours that Congress was considering taxing interest earned in the US by
foreign investors prompted heavy selling at the long end of the market.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 7/16 at
104, yielding 5.959 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down 7/32 at 99 31/32, to yield 3.874 per cent.
After the market's strong three-day rally that followed the unexpectedly
weak August employment report, no one was surprised yesterday when prices
turned tail. Although what sparked the selling was mere speculation - that a
Congressional committee is thinking of imposing a tax on foreign holdings of
Treasury securities - the reports were enough of an excuse for dealers and
investors to book some of the profits earned over the past week.
Prices recovered some of their losses later in the morning when staff
members in Congress said they doubted a tax on foreigners' Treasury holdings
would ever be passed into law. However, by mid-afternoon, the pace of
selling picked up again, sending prices to new session lows.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Austria's new issue market
springs to life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Austrian new issue market, long moribund because of deeply depressed
share prices, has found a new lease of life in the past few weeks.
Since late June, new primary and secondary equity issues raising more than
Sch3.7bn (Dollars 325.15m) have been launched, almost as much as in the
whole of last year. And there are many more in the pipeline.
The main reason for this surge of activity is the sharp recovery of the
Austrian stock market. Since a low point in January, the ATX index of 19
leading shares has jumped by some 40 per cent.
More importantly, volume has increased substantially since June, when
international institutional investors began to increase their weightings on
the Austrian market.
The biggest rights issues so far have been a Sch695m call in late June from
Maculan, the construction group that has acquired a clutch of companies in
eastern Germany, and a pair of issues worth a combined Sch1.9bn, which were
announced by Brau Beteiligungs and its Brau Union subsidiary last month.
The province of Burgenland has said it planned to float its 30 per cent
stake in electricity and gas utility Burgenland Holding to raise an expected
Sch300m. Leading food retailer Julius Meinl International announced a
one-for-two rights issue to raise Sch188m.
Analysts say the increased flow of cash calls reflects pent-up demand from
the long period when the stock market was too weak to absorb new issues.
'Companies have not been able to raise new equity for two years,' said Karl
Kaniak, a director of Bank Austria Investment Bank.
Mr Marko Musulin, director of securities and investment banking at
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, adds that many companies need new funds, either to
take advantage of one-off opportunities to expand in central and eastern
Europe or to promote new products developed in the past couple of years.
'The problem is that their profits are not in good shape because of the
recession, so they have to recapitalise,' Mr Musulin says.
A good example is Lenzing, the world leader in viscose fibre production. The
group has crippled its balance sheet and its profits by investing in
pollution control equipment in the past three years, and now needs new funds
to promote a viscose fibre it has developed to compete with cotton.
Meanwhile, the privatisation trend is still in the ascendant, as the
government looks for ways to ease a budget deficit bloated by recession.
In June, the troubled state owned Austrian Industries floated 74 per cent of
Austria Mikro Systeme, a maker of specialised integrated circuits, raising
Sch620m. Last month, the government said it would reduce its stake in
partially privatised Flughafen Wien, the company that operates Vienna's
airport, from 36.5 per cent to 25 per cent.
Meanwhile, speculation continues that the government will soon sell off some
of its controlling holding in Creditanstalt. The bank's shares have been
among Austria's best performers this year.
Austrian bankers expect the flow of new issues to continue well into next
year, provided that the sell-off in the market this week does not lead to
another slump.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Dollar sector holds stage with Dollars
600m Amexco offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISSUANCE in the international bond market picked up yesterday as borrowers
felt it was safe to return now that the World Bank's Dollars 1.25bn global
offering was out of the way.
The dollar sector remained the most active, as American Express raised
Dollars 600m through an offering of seven-year global bonds. The bonds,
which are backed by charge card debt, were priced to yield 38 basis points
over the yield on the 8 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2000, at the lower end
of the indicated range.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers, a subsidiary of American Express, said that
just under one-third of the offering was placed outside the US. American
Express raised Dollars 1bn through a similar offering last year.
Hydro-Quebec raised Dollars 200m through an offering of 12-year collared
floating rate notes and its rarity value in this market helped it to beat
its funding target by several basis points.
Most of the FRN offerings have been made by banks seeking to raise
subordinated debt. By contrast, Hydro-Quebec is the first provincial agency
in several months to issue senior notes in the FRN market.
Elsewhere, the Province of Ontario and the World Bank provided badly-needed
liquidity in the Canadian dollar sector. Syndicate managers said there was
strong demand from investors for Canadian dollar paper because of the
favourable outlook for the currency.
There have been few Canadian dollar deals in recent weeks and spreads on
outstanding issues have tightened considerably as a result. For example, the
spread on British Colombia's CDollars 400m 12-year offering has dropped to
42 basis points from its spread at launch on August 31 of 50 basis points
over the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 2003.
Ontario's CDollars 500m offering of 12-year Eurobonds was priced to yield 63
basis points over 10-year Canadian Treasuries, which matched the yield on
the borrower's 10-year global bonds.
The World Bank's CDollars 200m five-year offering was seen to be tightly
priced, at a yield spread of 10 basis points over the yield on the 6 1/2 per
cent Canadian Treasury due 1998.
However, demand was such that the bonds sold out quickly and the spread
tightened to less than nine basis points in the afternoon. The World Bank is
thought to have swapped the proceeds into D-Marks.
In the Eurosterling sector, Barclays Bank raised Pounds 100m through an
issue of fixed-rate perpetual Eurobonds. Barclays hopes to tap the current
demand among UK retail investors for high-yielding paper by providing them
with an option to take the bonds in registered form. In general, UK retail
investors are reluctant to buy bearer bonds.
The bonds were priced to yield 155 basis points over the yield on the 8 3/4
per cent UK government bond due 2017, a spread of five basis points over
Halifax Building Society's Pounds 100m issue of permanent interest bearing
shares which came earlier this week.
Lead manager BZW said there was a finite demand for this sort of product and
Sun Alliance's recent announcement that it intended to launch a Pounds 300m
undated preference share issue might deter other borrowers from tapping this
area of the market.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Long-term investors to get 30%
of BNP
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government plans to reserve 30 per cent of the shares in Banque
Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest banks, for long-term investors
when the bank is privatised later this month.
Union des Assurances de Paris, the powerful insurance group which is
scheduled for sale to the public later in the privatisation drive, will take
around 15 per cent of BNP's equity.
UAP presently holds 10 per cent of BNP which, in turn, plans to take a 20
per cent stake in the insurer after its privatisation.
A number of other long-term investors, or noyaux durs shareholders, will
take smaller minority stakes of between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent. These
investors will have to agree to hold their stakes for at least three years.
The French government has long made it clear that it plans to encourage
long-term shareholders to participate in the privatisation programme,
thereby helping to protect the former state-controlled companies from the
rigours of the private sector.
The noyaux durs are intended to form strategic alliances with the privatised
companies and to ward off the threat of hostile takeovers. Societe Generale,
another French bank, mobilised its noyaux durs to protect it against a late
1980s raid by Mr Georges Pebereau, the French financier who is the brother
of Mr Michel Pebereau, the BNP chairman.
BNP, one of the biggest banks in Europe which recently disclosed net profits
of FFr552m (Dollars 97m) on net banking income of FFr21.23bn for the first
half of this year, will be the first candidate for sale in the current
French government's privatisation drive.
The structure of the BNP issue should offer an important indication as to
the government's approach to future share sales. The final details of the
issue are expected to be announced before the end of this month.

despite the expectation that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has
secured a buyer for its 50 per cent stake.
News Corp announced last Friday that it was negotiating the sale of its
stake. For the past three days, announcements from News Corp have been
cancelled, encouraging speculation that there has been a hitch in the deal,
or that a counter-offer has been received.
The stock exchange said that the suspension would not be lifted on SCMP
shares until News Corp made an announcement that gave sufficient information
about the deal so that informed trading in the shares could resume.
It is widely expected in Hong Kong that the News Corp stake will be
purchased by a consortium led by Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok. At the
same time, Singapore's Straits Press group is tipped to take on a management
role in the Hong Kong newspaper.
Mr Kuok has no newspaper expertise, while Straits Press, which already owns
5 per cent of the SCMP, has made no secret of its desire to become the
leading newspaper publisher in South East Asia. The Singaporean United
Overseas Bank holds a further 9 per cent stake in SCMP.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi to shrink finance
division

MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's leading trading house, plans to shrink its
finance division in a move away from zaiteku, the financial engineering
popular among Japanese companies in the late 1980s.
The decision follows the company's bail-out earlier this year of MC Finance,
a group finance subsidiary which suffered from mounting investment losses.
In the late 1980s, financial investments became an important profit centre
for many industrial companies, which later suffered heavy portfolio losses
when the stock market turned sour.
MC Finance was created in 1986 to act as a banker for Mitsubishi
subsidiaries and affiliates, borrowing at discount rates and passing on the
savings to other group companies. MC Finance also turned to zaiteku, pouring
funds into the stock market.
Along with MC Finance, the group aggressively invested in specified money
trusts and fund trusts. Mitsubishi has been reducing its investment stocks,
and its outstanding investments stand at around Y230bn(Dollars 2.19bn).
Mitsubishi will disband its capital markets division, which had been the
centre of group investment operations since 1986, and shift about 30 of its
159 capital markets staff to its corporate information division.

SINGAPORE Airlines is to take a 10 per cent stake in a new aircraft
maintenance and repair facility being built in the city of Xiamen, on the
coast of China.
Other partners in the project are Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co, the
Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines and two Chinese state
controlled corporations. SIA's stake is believed to be worth just over
Dollars 6m.
SIA has developed its own aircraft maintenance and repair facilities in
recent years but now the carrier, like the other airlines involved in the
Xiamen project, is faced with spiralling land costs and acute labour
shortages.
Construction work at the Xiamen site has already begun and the facility is
due to be completed by 1996. Haeco, ultimately controlled by the Swire Group
of Hong Kong, will have a 41 per cent shareholding in the Xiamen project.
Airline industry analysts expect the Xiamen project to succeed, given the
rapid expansion of the airline business in the Asia Pacific, particularly in
China.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLES Myers, the Australian retail group, yesterday reported an 8 per cent
increase in operating profit to ADollars 598.7m (USDollars 394.1m), before
abnormal items, for the year ended July 25.
After tax and abnormal items, the increase was slightly higher - up 11.1 per
cent to ADollars 411.8m. Sales, adjusted for the sale of the majority of
Coles Myer's interest in Progressive Enterprises and Sandhurst Dairies, rose
by 3.7 per cent to ADollars 15.2bn.
On an unadjusted basis, sales were essentially flat.
The retailer said that it was pleased with the results, given the
recessionary climate. The strongest performances came from the Kmart, Target
and specialty group divisions.
Coles admitted that the profits from its supermarkets division were only
'marginally' ahead of last year, but that performance here had strengthened
in the second half of the year.
The Myer Grace Bros department stores, however, saw lower profits and weaker
margins - a trend blamed on the 'reduced levels of discretionary spending'.
Coles said that sales for the year overall were steady, but that turnover
had been disappointing in the final three months of the financial year.
Coles added that the 'signs of economic recovery are still tentative' and
conceded that the effect of this hesitant upturn on its own operations was
'uneven'.
However, it suggested that the previously-announced investment plan should
help sustain future performance.
Lend Lease, the financial services and property investment group, yesterday
announced that it was buying the Yarmouth Group, a US-based asset management
business.
Yarmouth has around ADollars 10bn in gross property assets under management
and manages client portfolios worth around ADollars 6.5bn. Among its
interests is the management of some 15 regional malls in the US, whose gross
value is put at USDollars 2bn-plus.
No price was announced for the acquisition, and Lend Lease said the
consideration would be related to performance and payable over a five-year
period.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais sets up
commodities arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French investment bank, has formed a new derivatives
arm to concentrate on over-the-counter commodities products.
Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives will extend the company's existing
commodity swaps and hedging arrangements into structured finance deals.
Mr Chris Mason, managing director, said: 'Now almost all of our business is
in traditional corporate hedging. In five years' time, I think we'll be
earning 80 per cent of our income from these new financing deals.'
The new group is looking to design tailor-made arrangements for corporate
clients to hedge raw materials costs on a long-term basis. It offers
companies a chance to hedge their exposure over several years and longer
than is available on the world's futures exchanges.
Mr Mason believes the food sector offers good potential to expand its
structured finance deals since hedging is so rare in the industry.
The new company is targeting users of coffee, sugar and cocoa as part of its
marketing campaign. It has worked out hedges for six European consumers of
orange juice over the past 18 months and recently signed up several Florida
producers.
CLRD is working on a model for hedging the green pound - the currency in
which agricultural producers are paid EC subsidies - for which Mr Mason sees
great demand from many food companies.
More traditional areas in which CLRD hopes to make a big impact are airline
financing, project financing for mining companies and aluminium leasing.
Mr Mason says the use of swap deals and swaptions to stabilise jet fuel
costs can reduce the funding levels of an airline finance arrangement by 100
basis points or 1 per cent depending on the amount of leverage involved.
In addition, a hedging arrangement for the output of, say, a mining company,
can be set in advance when funds are being put together for its development.

BRIERLEY Investments reports an 8 per cent increase in net profit to
NZDollars 271.3m (USDollars 149.8m) for the year ended June, despite
continued weak trading by its UK hotels arm.
Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said that the result was satisfactory given that
around one-third of the parent company's total assets, its 70 per cent
interest in the Mount Charlotte UK group, did little better than break even.
In the past two months, however, Mount Charlotte hotels had recorded a
marked improvement in occupancies, and directors were confident the recovery
was under way.
The New Zealand division recorded earnings of NZDollars 245m, up from
NZDollars 154m. Earnings from Australia were NZDollars 57m, compared with a
loss of NZDollars 33m last time. The newly created US arm, which had
budgeted for a small profit, made a loss of NZDollars 11.6m.
Earnings from the UK were NZDollars 5m, down from NZDollars 116m last year
when the Tozer Kemsley motor group, subsequently sold, was included. The
major associates Air New Zealand and Carter Holt Harvey recorded good
profits.
Earnings from New Zealand in the coming year would be boosted by the
purchase of fishing group Sealord, although this would be offset from the
loss of profits from interests in New Zealand companies that had been sold.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Brand new direction heralds
flotation of Japan Tobacco - The company's plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN Tobacco, the government owned tobacco company set for privatisation
early next year, is actively investing in new projects and introducing new
cigarette brands ahead of the flotation.
The company, the third largest tobacco company in the world, controls 83 per
cent of Japan's Y3,000bn (Dollars 28.4bn) domestic tobacco market. JT been
restructuring its business since 1985 - when the market was opened to
foreign competition - reducing the number of distribution outlets by 36 per
cent to 174 and the number of staff by 20 per cent to 24,000.
Due partly to this rationalisation, its bank borrowings are low relative to
other government-owned companies waiting to go public. Bank debt at JR East,
the rail group about to be privatised, is more than 16 per cent of total
assets: at JT the ratio is under 1 per cent.
The company's operations and decisions on pricing are less regulated than at
JR East and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-state owned telecom
company.
Japan's cigarette market is very mature. Mr Shigeru Mizuno, JT president,
says: 'In terms of volume, the industry is declining.' Industry sales for
the 12 months ended March 1992 fell 0.5 per cent to 272.6bn cigarettes.
JT also faces growing competition from foreign tobacco companies, notably
Philip Morris of the US which now hold 17 per cent of the market. Analysts
predict that foreign companies will hold over 20 per cent of the market
within the next few years.
The company's competitiveness is clearly hampered by regulations over the
amount of home grown raw tobacco it has to buy in. In general, Japanese
tobacco costs between and three times more than foreign grown tobacco.
Japanese tobacco makes up around 50 per cent of JT's tobacco purchases.
JT is now looking to diversify. Mr Mizuno envisages growth in new business
sectors such as foods, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and cigarette exports.
The company entered the non-alcoholic beverage and pharmaceuticals market in
1988, and started a hot-dog chain in 1989. Its lily bulb business and an
electric power switch manufacturing operation are among its more recent
ventures.
Exports account for less than 1 per cent of JT's total sales. It is
targeting Asian cigarette markets, which unlike western markets, are still
growing. Some 60 per cent of JT's overseas sales are in Asia.
Analysts feel that some of the new projects will be slow to contribute to
JT's profits. Mr Eizo Uchikura, of Nomura Research Institute, says property
could make a near term contribution but JT's drug operations are unlikely to
make a return before the end of the decade.

BANK Bumiputra, Malaysia's second biggest bank, reports pre-tax profits of

The result represents a rise of nearly 90 per cent on last year.  Bank
Bumiputra has assets of MDollars 35bn.
The bank, set up in the mid-1960s to help the bumiputras, or Malays, who
make up about 50 per cent of Malaysia's population, has been plagued by
scandal. Twice in the past 10 years the state has had to step in to rescue

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dow Corning plans implant fund -
Proposals to create a landmark settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Corning's unexpected announcement yesterday of a proposal to settle all
litigation involving silicone-gel breast implants may become a landmark in
mass tort litigation, in addition to lifting the cloud that has been cast
over the company since early last year when the Food and Drug Association
imposed a moratorium on the devices amid mounting concerns about safety.
The details of the plan are far from firm, but according to Mr Gary
Anderson, Dow Corning vice-president: 'From what I've been told, this is a
unique and different settlement.' The company, once the biggest manufacturer
of the devices, plans to join with other manufacturers, as well as raw
material suppliers, insurance carriers, physicians and other health care
providers to establish a Dollars 4.75bn fund over a 30-year period.
'It would be a large pool with different types of buckets,' says Mr
Anderson, 'covering everything from health check-ups and implant removal
where necessary to treatment and compensation for someone with a documented
disease related to the implants.'
For Dow Corning, a joint venture owned equally by Dow Chemical and Corning,
the proposal may help restore its reputation at a considerable cost. The
company said the settlement would 'likely have a material adverse effect on
Dow Corning's results of operations in the period in which it is recorded
and could possibly have a material adverse effect on the company's
consolidated financial position'. The company did not elaborate.
The proposed settlement is expected to be less of a financial burden for Dow
and Corning at parent level. Corning said yesterday that its share of such a
charge would have a adverse impact on earnings only in the quarter in which
such a charge is recognised.
Dow Corning has been trying to clear its name since 1991, when a San
Francisco court decided that the company had concealed evidence linking
ruptured implants to immune disorders and issued a Dollars 7.3m verdict
against the company. After initially adopting a combative stance with the
FDA, by early 1992 Dow Corning had changed its top management and taken a
more conciliatory approach.
As recently as January this year, however, the company balked at turning
over an outside counsel's report on its breast implants to the FDA.
Although Dow Corning and other manufacturers have steadfastly maintained
that their products pose no danger, a growing number of researchers in the
US are finding links between leaking silicone and diseases of the human
immune system. Dow Corning is investing at least Dollars 10m to research the
safety of silicone gel. The company is sponsoring a study to see whether
silicon causes scleroderma, a potentially fatal immune-system illness.
From a legal standpoint, the proposal has been compared to the Dollars 2.4bn
fund established in 1989 after 10 years of litigation over the Dalkon Shield
contraceptive, which was manufactured by A. H. Robins. The case contributed
to the company's bankruptcy filing.
Mr Guerry Thornton, a partner at Atlanta-based Thornton &amp; Leff who handles
claims against the Dalkon Shield trust and represents 15 implant plaintiffs,
said: 'From what we've been told, this would be similar to the Dalkon Shield
plan. Presuming there is a hearing to investigate the fund and see that
everyone is fairly and equally treated, I think everyone will benefit. It
will end up saving hundreds of millions of dollars in litigation costs -
money that would normally go to legal and medical experts would go directly
to the victims.
'Dalkon Shield has been by far the most successful mass tort resolution in
history. Hopefully this plan will incorporate the most favourable provisions
from that plan and implement some others to become the landmark settlement
used in the future to resolve other mass tort cases.'

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: US group's Alzheimer's drug wins
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday it had given
Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals concern, final clearance to market
Cognex, the first drug specifically approved in the US for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease.
The drug, which was developed by the company's Parke-Davis division, could
generate annual revenues of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m within a
few years, according to an estimate by Oppenheimer, the New York brokerage
house. Warner-Lambert declined to comment on projected sales, but said
Cognex treatments would cost patients about Dollars 3.50 a day.
Government approval had been expected as Cognex received a favourable
recommendation from an FDA advisory committee in March, after being turned
down twice by the panel in 1991. Even so, Warner-Lambert shares rose sharply
yesterday afternoon, closing Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 69 1/8 .
The drug was found to be effective in easing the symptoms of patients in the
mild-to-moderate stages of Alzheimer's, an illness characterised by
progressive decline of memory, judgment and ability to reason. There is no
evidence that Cognex alters the course of the underlying dementia process.
An estimated 4m Americans are afflicted with the disease, and the company
estimates that 50 to 70 per cent could benefit from Cognex treatment.
The FDA last night called for new tests on SmithKline Beecham's ulcer drug
Tagamet.
The UK pharmaceuticals group was hoping to receive approval to sell its
best-selling product over the counter in the US as a treatment for
heartburn, writes Peter John in London.
If the drug were approved the potential boost to the company's sales was
estimated at between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m a year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food products group, said yesterday it had achieved
record earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a strong
contribution from overseas markets.
Earnings and revenues for the full year also reached record levels for the
fourth consecutive time.
The results highlight Campbell's recent efforts to reorganise its global
operations, as well as its renewed emphasis on its core soup, biscuits and
bakery businesses.
Net earnings in the quarter to August 1 were 11 per cent higher at Dollars
122m, or 48 cents a share, up from Dollars 109m, or 44 cents. Revenues rose
7 per cent from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.5bn.
Before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, earnings in the 1993
quarter were 15 per cent up.
For the full year, net earnings before special charges rose by almost 17 per
cent to Dollars 574m, or Dollars 2.28 a share.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Perrier bolsters sales at Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the world's largest foods and mineral waters group, said its
first-half net income rose 6 per cent to SFr1.25bn (Dollars 893m), on sales
of SFr27.45bn, up 4.4 per cent.
In view of the recession in Europe and the devaluation of a number of
European currencies, the result was 'satisfactory,' it said.
It also confirmed its July forecast that sales volume would pick up in the
second half, and that profits for the year would show 'a satisfactory rise'.
Although volume in the first half grew by 5.5 per cent, all but 1 per cent
came from the acquisition of the Source Perrier mineral water business.
This 'momentary' weak internal growth was attributed to lower consumer
spending in Europe. Volume in North America was up slightly, and 'very
appreciably' in eastern Asia and Latin America.
Trading profit was up 4.9 per cent to SFr2.69bn.
Net financing costs jumped to SFr434m in the first half, from SFr307m in the
comparable period, reflecting the cost of the Perrier acquisition.
Net borrowings rose to SFr10.4bn at the end of the period, compared with
SFr8.9bn a year earlier, prior to the acquisition. However, in July, the
group collected SFr1.2bn in proceeds from its spring rights issue.
In its letter to shareholders, Nestle said the recent alarm in financial
circles about the value of branded food products arising from the marketing
problems of Marlboro cigarettes was unwarranted.
The company 'remains convinced that the major brands guarantee a superior
and a recognised quality'.

Names touted on Wall Street include Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple

The administrative law judge, charged with deciding Mr Lorenzo's fitness to

Mr Lorenzo was the industry's most controversial figure in the 1980s. As

liquidation and Continental into bankruptcy proceedings, from which it
recently emerged.

ARGENTINA intends to begin a new round of flotations of privatised companies

electricity generators.
Mr Daniel Marx, the government's top financial negotiator, said yesterday
the sale of 30 per cent stakes in the Costanera and Central Puerto power
stations should raise about Dollars 100m for the government.
The announcement follows the successful Dollars 3.04bn international
flotation in June of 45 per cent of YPF, the state-owned oil company. Mr
Marx said the electricity flotations would open the way for the sale next
year of minority government stakes in the larger gas transport and
distribution companies.
The sale of three Buenos Aires electricity distribution companies and other
generators would come later.
Central Puerto, with 1,009MW capacity, and Costanera, a 1,260MW station,
were privatised in April and May last year. Chilgener of Chile paid Dollars
92.2m for 60 per cent of Central Puerto, and Endesa, also of Chile, paid
Dollars 90.1m for 60 per cent of Costanera. Mr Marx said the two were
'extremely well-run and we think are mature and can be floated without any
problem'.
He said these companies, given their relatively small size, would be aimed
mainly at local investors. The flotation would be handled by local banks.
The remaining 10 per cent equity will be held by company employees in a
share ownership scheme.
Next year the government plans to sell its minority stakes in 10 gas
transport and distribution companies carved out of the former state-owned
gas monopoly.
Gas del Estado was privatised last December in a Dollars 3.99bn cash and
debt-for-equity swap for stakes ranging from 60 to 90 per cent.
Mr Marx said the sale of government stakes in the electricity distribution
companies would come last.

Their mines are in northern Saskatchewan. Their capacity, plus Katep's,

Cameco, now 51.5 per cent-held by the public, is carrying out a feasibility

Cominco reached agreement with 2,000 members of the United Steelworkers at

The results are much better than those of most other South African

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Record term for Campbell Soup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food products group, said yesterday it had achieved
record earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a strong
contribution from overseas markets. Earnings and revenues for the full year
also reached record levels for the fourth consecutive time.
The results highlight Campbell's recent efforts to reorganise its global
operations, as well as its renewed emphasis on its core soup, biscuits and
bakery businesses.
Net earnings in the quarter to August 1 were 11 per cent higher at Dollars
122m, or 48 cents a share, up from Dollars 109m, or 44 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1992. Revenues in the period, which contained an
additional week, rose 7 per cent from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.5bn.
Before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, earnings in the 1993
quarter were 15 per cent up.
For the full year, net earnings before special charges rose to Dollars 574m,
or Dollars 2.28 a share, nearly 17 per cent higher than in the 1992 period.
Sales rose by a less robust 5 per cent from Dollars 6.3bn to Dollars 6.6bn.
Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive, attributed earnings growth
to the 3 per cent global sales increase in the group's flagship soup
business, coupled with a 31 per cent profits increase from its overseas
businesses.
However, the results from non-US operations were exaggerated by the group's
acquisition in February of a 58 per cent controlling stake in Arnott's, the
Australian biscuits business, after a bitter takeover battle. Arnott's
contribution was included in the third and fourth quarters.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST BOSTON, the global investment banking group, has appointed Mr Allen
Wheat to the post of president and chief operating officer vacated by Mr
Archibald Cox. Mr Cox resigned after clashing with management over
compensation levels for the firm's investment bankers.
Mr Wheat's appointment to the top job at CSFB was accompanied by several
other management changes, and coincided with a decision to unify the firm's
three geographic units - First Boston in New York, Credit Suisse-First
Boston in Europe, and CS First Boston Pacific in Asia - under the single
name of CS First Boston.
Mr Wheat, who will handle the day-to-day running of the firm and report to
Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of CSFB, scotched speculation among some
industry analysts that his appointment meant CSFB was shifting the emphasis
of its business away from investment banking and towards trading in the
capital markets. This was based on Mr Wheat's recent handling of the firm's
highly-profitable derivatives unit.
Mr Wheat and Mr Hennessy said yesterday CSFB would continue to devote equal
energy to capital markets, underwriting and mergers and acquisitions.
The unification of the group under a single name, meanwhile, was not
unexpected. It comes three months after CSFB reorganised its businesses
along product, rather than geographic, lines. That move marked an acceptance
by senior executives and CSFB's parent, the Swiss financial group CS
Holding, that business rivalries and personality clashes between the New
York, London and Tokyo units had doomed the group's attempt to build a
unique global investment banking franchise.
Tensions between the three units had contributed to the departure of Mr
Wheat's predecessor. Mr Cox resigned in July after a string of top New York
investment bankers left the firm over a row about compensation. The departed
bankers were unhappy that their annual bonuses last year were low because of
the poor performance of CSFB's European and Asian operations.
Mr Wheat said the firm's businesses in New York, London and Tokyo had all
performed strongly so far this year. If the momentum was sustained, the
improvement in earnings would be reflected in 1993 staff bonuses, he said.
Mr David Mulford, co-head of worldwide investment banking, and Mr Robert
Diamond, head of fixed income and foreign exchange, were appointed
vice-chairmen of CSFB.

The judge said ATX had shown a pattern of 'disobeying orders and filing
frivolous and vexatious pleadings' during his proceedings.
'It certainly cannot be trusted to comply with federal law regulating the
transportation of passengers and cargo in scheduled air service,' he said.
ATX said it was confident the decision would be overturned.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canon bid for Rentsch fuels
Swiss takeover row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANON has become the latest bidder to take advantage of the absence of
effective Swiss takeover regulations.
The large Japanese office equipment group has agreed to purchase the
controlling 50.7 per cent stake in Walter Rentsch, a quoted Swiss office
equipment distributor and retailer, from Mr Hubert Looser. Terms have not
yet been finalised. However, no offer is being made to minority
shareholders.
This is the fourth such case in three years of minority shareholders of
Swiss companies being ignored or offered inferior terms in takeover bids.
The others were the Philip Morris takeover of confectionery group Jacobs
Suchard in 1990; the purchase by Mr August von Fink in 1992 of the
controlling stake in the hotel group Movenpick; and the takeover of the
controlling holding in Kardex last year by Industrieholding Cham.
Each case has provoked criticism in Swiss stock market circles, and new
legislation to eliminate discrimination against minority shareholders is
being considered.
Mr H. J. Scheffer, manager of EC affairs for Canon Europe in Amsterdam, said
the company's move was 'in line with Swiss practice'.
One analyst suggested a possible conflict of interest in that Canon products
accounted for up to 70 per cent of Rentsch sales. The Japanese group might
in the future arrange transfer pricing of its products to the detriment of
the Swiss company's profits, he said.

THE BELGIAN government is likely to clear the way today for Fortis, the
Dutch-Belgian financial services group, to buy a majority stake in
ASLK-CGER, the state-owned savings and insurance group.
The government hopes to raise BFr35bn (Dollars 992m) with the sale of shares
in ASLK-CGER, which has a national network of banking and insurance
branches.
It is the first candidate for sale in a four-year privatisation programme
which will help cut Belgium's large budget deficit.
At their regular cabinet meeting today, ministers should approve the change
in legislation which will allow Fortis to acquire a majority of the group.
Fortis was likely to buy 49.9% of the shares with an option to but a
majority later. The price is still under negotiation.
Meanwhile, Fortis, which groups the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of
the Netherlands, reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profit to
Ecu226.7m (Dollars 194m), compared with Ecu188.5m in the same period of
1992.
Total revenues grew by 10 per cent, from Ecu4.28bn to Ecu4.7bn, on strong
increases in income from life insurance and banking, particularly in the
Netherlands.
Fortis said it expected operating results and net profits for the whole of
1993 to surpass the 1992 figure.
The company also benefited from a strong increase in capital gains - from
Ecu50.6m to Ecu93.8m - boosted by profits from the sale of most of its 14.7
per cent stake in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank. That sale, and
a number of smaller disposals, have left Fortis well placed to buy into
ASLK-CGER.
Fortis was reluctant yesterday about the ASLK-CGER deal. A spokeswoman
pointed out that since the end of July the Dutch-Belgian company has had
exclusive rights to negotiate with the savings bank. That privilege lasts
until October 15.
Generale de Banque complained earlier this week that the Belgian government
had missed a great opportunity to regenerate interest in the Brussels bourse
by rejecting its proposal to mastermind a British-style public offer of
shares in ASLK-CGER.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Plastics fall dents UCB profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNTURN in the plastics sector and the aftermath of European currency
turmoil held back first half profits at UCB, the Belgian chemicals company.
The group's pre-tax profits fell from BFr1.49bn (Dollars 42.49m) in the
first half of last year, to BFr1.07bn. However, an exceptional gain of
BFr988m, due mainly to profit on the sale of the group's Belgian chemicals
subsidiary Vel, helped increase after tax profits to BFr1.75bn from
BFr1.57bn.
The company said exceptional gains would help it to match 1992's record net
profit of BFr2.25bn, but pre-tax earnings for the year would be lower than
in 1992.
Mr Georges Jacobs, UCB chief executive, said devaluation of a number of
European currencies had hit the group's sales, which slipped to BFr23.4bn
from BFr24.6bn in the first half. He estimated that the effects of the
currency turmoil might have reduced interim profits by some BFr100m.
Mr Jacobs also held out the hope that Zyrtec, UCB's successful anti-allergy
drug, would win approval from the Food &amp; Drug Administration for marketing
in the US before the end of this year.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nissan may sell shares to cut
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second largest manufacturer of cars, may sell shareholdings
in an attempt to offset trading losses it is likely to have made in the six
months ending this month.
The move, which is highly unusual for a Japanese company, reflects the
pressures Nissan faces from a sharp downturn in the Japanese car market,
which fell nearly 7 per cent in the first half of 1993.
If implemented, it could prompt similar action by other Japanese companies
suffering from falling revenues and lead to a general unravelling of the web
of cross shareholdings linking Japan's corporate giants with financial
institutions, sub-contractors and group companies.
Nissan is considering selling its stakes in leading banks and life insurance
companies in an attempt to cover first half trading losses. In May it warned
that pre-tax losses for the period would total around Y40bn (Dollars 379m).
The shares are part of cross-shareholdings Japanese companies hold widely in
order to cement relationships with their leading banks and corporate
clients. Nissan's stock holdings amount to Y391.4bn at book value, the
company said.
While it is common practice for Japanese companies to sell part of these
holdings to realise profits at the end of the year, they normally buy them
back straight away.
In a first-ever move for the company, however, Nissan will not buy back the
shares it sells at the end of the fiscal year. Nissan also said it is likely
to sell part of its property holdings as well.
With the sharp appreciation of the yen and the increasing possibility that
the Japanese economy will remain sluggish for some time, Nissan is uncertain
how much of that Y40bn it will be able to recoup in the second half of
1993-94.
The Japanese car industry is bracing itself for a third year of falling
demand. Exports have suffered both fromthe high yen, which has forced
Japanese car makers to raise prices in the competitive US market, and the
recession in Europe. Meanwhile, the yen's rise has squeezed profits from
overseas sales.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said last month that economic weakness
and the yen's rise had forced the company to lower production plans by
several percentage points.
Nissan has already launched a restructuring programme aimed at cutting
Y200bn in costs March 1996. Earlier this year, it announced plans to close a
car plant in Zama, on the outskirts of Tokyo.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is poised to break into the internal Spanish data
transmission market, loosening the grip on the sector held by Telefonica,
the Spanish government controlled group, through a surprise agreement with
Banco Santander, the big domestic financial institution.
The British telecoms group, which opened a representative office in Spain
four years ago, is negotiating the acquisition of up to 50 per cent of
Megared, a potentially powerful data transmission company created by
Santander in 1989 to serve the banking group's extensive network. Megared
has been under-utilised and is seeking to build up its business through
attracting outside clients.
An agreement on the acquisition is expected as early as next week and it
will include the allocation of licences to operate privately-owned data
transmission companies within Spain which have been promised by the
government in October.
The negotiations were fuelled by the government decision last June to
deregulate data transmission services to meet the EC directives on the
liberalisation of telecommunications. Santander's Megared and BT had
independently applied for licences and the decision to unite in a joint
venture was viewed by analysts as a highly convenient marriage of interests.
In a second deregulation phase, timed for January, the government is set to
award licences to operate cellular telephones.
Under the liberalisation plans, up to 15 per cent of Telefonica's revenues
are expected to face competition. Although voice transmission will remain in
Telefonica's domain for the foreseeable future, the deregulation will affect
the high growth and high margin areas of the telecommunications sector.

THE FRENCH government yesterday reduced its stake in Total, the oil group,
from 8.17 per cent to 5 per cent through a market placing at FFr296 a share.
The sale, which raised FFr2.06bn (Dollars 361m), was ordered by Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, who has said that the state regards a 5
per cent holding in the oil company as its desired level.
The stake had increased to 8.17 per cent over the past year through the
conversion of preferential subordinated notes.

<TEXT>
BALLAST Nedam, the Dutch construction subsidiary of British Aerospace, is
holding talks with Boskalis, another large Dutch construction company, to
explore possible forms of co-operation, including a merger.
The companies said the talks, which have been going on for several weeks,
are taking place in consultation with BAe.
A spokesman for Boskalis said it was too early to say what the conclusions
of the talks might be. However, he added that potential co-operation could
be far-reaching, with a merger among the possibilities.
The companies will not comment on the progress of the talks until they are
completed.
Ballast Nedam's future has been uncertain for some time, partly because of
BAe's own restructuring. In December, Ballast Nedam chairman, Mr Willem
Maeyer, resigned after BAe decided against hiving off the company through
either a buy-out or a bourse flotation.
Ballast Nedam, with annual turnover of Fl 2.2bn (Dollars 1.2bn), and
Boskalis, with turnover of nearly Fl 1bn, described themselves as companies
which 'potentially complement and strengthen each other's market position'.
Boskalis, a leading international dredging company and a specialist in
marine construction, generates 80 per cent of its business outside the
Netherlands. Ballast Nedam, traditionally strong in the Middle East, does
about half of its business overseas.
Ballast Nedam's expertise in the Middle East - it built the causeway linking
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - was the main reason why BAe acquired the company
in 1987.

FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: CBOT to reconsider bund future
sole rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, one of the partners in Globex, the global
electronic trading system, is prepared to reconsider its position on
retaining sole rights to trade bund futures on the system, CBOT chairman Mr
Pat Arbor said yesterday.
Last month, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange
pulled out of negotiations to join Globex when the CBOT insisted on its
exclusive rights. Reuter and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CBOT's two
Globex partners, subsequently blamed the CBOT for Liffe's withdrawal in a
series of acrimonious letters.
Mr Arbor told a press conference at the Swiss Commodities Futures and
Options Association's annual meeting in Burgenstock, Switzerland: 'You might
view this as an invitation to reopen negotiations.'
However, he also insisted that there had been no fundamental change in the
CBOT's position and emphasised that two other issues - the governance of
Globex and the length of any contract between Globex and Liffe - would have
to be resolved first.
On this matter there seems to a difference of opinion between Mr Arbor and
Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of both the CME and Globex. Mr Sandner said that
the main stumbling block to an agreement with Liffe was the Bund contract
issue. Liffe officials have expressed the same view, saying that progress
has been made on the other issues.
Mr Arbor said the length of Liffe's commitment was a crucial issue. France's
Matif, the only exchange to have joined Globex since its launch over a year
ago, agreed to a 12 1/2 -year commitment, while Liffe was asking for just a
1 1/2 -year contract, he said. Nevertheless, Mr Arbor seemed to be adopting
a more positive stance, saying 'it's my feeling that we would be favourably
disposed to giving up exclusivity' if the other issues were resolved.

despite sales decline
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOLS WESSANEN, the Dutch food and beverages group created by a merger this
year, reported a 7 per cent rise in net profit for the first half of the
year, in spite of a slight decline in sales.
Net profit rose to Fl 119.6m (Dollars 64.6m) from a pro forma Fl 111.8m a
year earlier, while sales dropped 4.8 per cent to Fl 2.5bn.
The sales decline was due mainly to divestments, which reduced turnover by a
combined Fl 231m.
Another reason was a 7 per cent fall in sales in the beverages group,
largely reflecting the lower value of the Italian lira.
Despite the sales drop, the beverages group raised operating profit 5 per
cent to Fl 77.6m, representing the largest single contribution to Bols
Wessanen's total operating profit of Fl 173m.
In the dairy group, which includes Leerdammer cheese and frozen yoghurt,
sales were flat but operating profit also rose 5 per cent, to Fl 65.7m.

ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has agreed to sell an 81 per
cent stake in its Italian-based packaging company Tambox CCC to the Dutch
group Esswell Packaging.
Enso declined to reveal the terms of the deal but it said that the sale of
the loss-making operation would not affect its 1993 results.
The company only acquired the subsidiary in April this year, as part of its
purchase of Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe.
Tambox CCC operates three paperboard mills and three corrugated box plants
in Italy, with net 1992 sales amounting to FM400m (Dollars 69.8m).
Enso said that it wished to sell the unit because it did not fit
geographically with its other corrugated box manufacturing operations in
Sweden and Finland.
The company is to retain a 19 per cent stake in the subsidiary to reflect
its role as a leading raw material supplier to the European corrugating
industry.
Esswell Packaging is the holding company for a privately-owned group of
corrugated box companies in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Germany.

A SMALL marketing services company yesterday hit back at a rival which has
bought the voting rights of 23 per cent of its equity, saying the deal
breaches takeover panel rules.
USM-quoted International Communications and Data, which expects to announce
a pre-tax loss for the year to May 31 of Pounds 5m in the next two weeks
following a reorganisation, said the investment was unwelcome. Its shares
closed up 1 1/2 p at 13p yesterday.
ICD said that an investor group led by PSB Group, a direct marketing
company, had paid Pounds 100,000 for 2 per cent of ICD's equity at 5p a
share and the voting rights for six months on a further 21 per cent of the
equity. Of those shares, it has an option to buy for 14p each share
representing 13 per cent of the equity.
Mr David Cicurel, ICD's chairman, said: 'They have a lot of votes for very
little money risk and I would jolly well hope they have the interests of all
shareholders at heart.' PSB got its new interests from Mr Nigel Balcombe and
Mr John Apthorp, a former ICD chairman and director.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIELD Diagnostics, the Dundee-based biotechnology company, yesterday raised
more than Pounds 5m through a placing of about 30 per cent of its shares
with institutions and private investors.
Allied Provincial Securities, which handled the issue, said 5.5m ordinary
shares had been placed at 112p.
After the placing 18.6m shares are in issue, giving the company a market
capitalisation of Pounds 20.82m.
About half the shares were placed with nine institutions, with the remainder
going to private investors. They begin trading on the London Stock Exchange
on September 23.
In addition, 358,690 ordinary shares were placed on behalf of some directors
and employees to raise Pounds 401,734 before expenses. No other existing
shareholders have realised their investment.
A group of venture capitalists, including Apax Partners, Summa and Cygnus
Ventures, held 90 per cent of the stock before the flotation and now hold 57
per cent.
The net proceeds of Pounds 5.24m will be used to clear the group's
borrowings of about Pounds 500,000, and to provide working capital to allow
further product acquisition and development.
Shield, which makes 65 per cent of its sales outside the UK, specialises in
developing, making and marketing in vitro tests for human disease.
It is rare among biotechnology companies that have come to the market
recently in that it already has 23 products for sale.
The company made no profits forecast and gave no notional dividend in its
prospectus.
In the year to the end of March it had a total turnover of Pounds 1.68m,
compared with a previous Pounds 445,000. Gross profits were Pounds 1.1m
(Pounds 305,000). After net operating expenses of Pounds 1.74m (Pounds
1.69m) and interest payments, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 653,000, cut from
Pounds 1.43m in the previous year.
Mr Gordon Hall, the chief executive who was recruited from Abbot Diagnostics
of the US, insisted that Shield was different from other UK biotechnology
groups as it already has commercial products and established marketing and
licensing agreements.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas static after better second
quarter - Regulatory squeeze on margins and OFT requirement hits UK supply
activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the half year results of British Gas were little changed from the
half-way point last year, the overall figures released yesterday masked a
continuing change in the company's structure.
As foreshadowed by a statement made at the time of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report last month, profits for the six months to June 30
on a historical cost basis were Pounds 634m compared with Pounds 637m a year
earlier.
That included a second quarter loss of Pounds 16m, a slight improvement on
the corresponding quarter's deficit of Pounds 21m.
The interim dividend remains unchanged at 6.4p.
The result showed a fall in operating profit from UK gas supply from Pounds
809m to Pounds 742m because of the regulatory squeeze on margins and the
Office of Fair Trading requirement that British Gas divest itself of a major
portion of the industrial market.
Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, said that 59 per cent of the firm
contract market and 17 per cent of the market for customers using more than
2,500 therms a year was now in the hands of the competition.
Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said that overall gas sales were down
2 per cent, but the result included a benefit of Pounds 36m attributable to
the slightly colder weather in the UK over the period.
Regulatory actions cost the company Pounds 140m in the first half through
enforced loss of market share and price controls.
Against this, overseas gas supply raised its contribution from Pounds 94m to
Pounds 123m, and exploration and production rose from Pounds 112m to Pounds
196m. British Gas is now active in Argentina and Canada, and expects to sign
a major contract shortly in Trinidad.
Mr Robert Evans, the chairman, said that the relaxation of the price formula
recommended by the MMC 'will do little to restore the profitability of the
UK gas supply business. Even with the major rationalisation which we intend
to implement, profits from that business will not reach the levels achieved
in recent years, and the adverse effects will be felt by the company as a
whole.'
He said the investment programme, which totalled Pounds 2bn last year, would
have to be reduced. However, he believed that the structure proposed by the
MMC would introduce 'a measure of stability and clarity' to the industry.
British Gas has already warned that the changes being forced upon it will
result in the loss of 20,000 jobs over three years. So far this year, 3,000
have gone, bringing the total down to 79,284.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering doubles to Pounds 3.75m
with help of associates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALL ENGINEERING (Hold-ings) yesterday announced more than doubled
first-half profits and joined the growing list of companies to offer an
'enhanced' scrip dividend to save cash and reduce its tax bill.
The Shrewsbury-based steel stockholding, construction products and
engineering group lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 3.75m
as operating profit rose by one-third, the share of associated company
profits jumped by two-thirds while the interest charge fell by one-third.
Earnings per share jumped from 2.27p to 8.2p.
The record Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1.96m) profit from associated companies -
almost all of which came from the four companies in Singapore, Indonesia and
Hong Kong - served to highlight Hall's tax poser. As profits derive
predominantly from overseas it is less able to offset its ACT liabilities.
Hall is to accelerate the dividend payment by making an interim pay-out of
6.48p (3.3p) and, as an alternative, offer shareholders new shares based on
an enhanced figure 50 per cent above the interim cash dividend.
These shares can be sold to Kleinwort Benson at a minimum guaranteed price.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said that if the scrip dividend was fully
subscribed, the company would save Pounds 2.5m from not paying the dividend
nor the related ACT. On a pro-forma basis earnings per share would improve
by 2.1p and gearing would be lower by 8 percentage points.
Hall's move, timed to pre-empt any possible Budget measures, comes as UK
profits mount an impressive recovery, which will reduce the amount of ACT
that the company has to write off.
In steel stockholding, a deficit of Pounds 108,000 in the first half of last
year was turned into an operating profit of Pounds 366,000 this time. 'There
is much more stability in the market and we are having much less trouble
getting our margins', said Mr Hall.
The BRC steel reinforcement business, strengthened by new management, posted
an operating profit of Pounds 117,000, compared with a Pounds 659,000 loss.
In contrast, profits fell in the engineering division from Pounds 1.91m to
Pounds 1.05m. This reflects a Pounds 500,000 provision for 90 redundancies
at the Stadco pressings business, and a loss of Pounds 300,000 in Stadco's
automation business, where profits on some important long-term contracts
have yet to be booked.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Details of FT-SE announcements
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the text of the notice issued on Wednesday by the FT-SE Actuaries UK
Indices Committee.
The Committee, at its meeting today, proposed a change to the rules
concerning the definition of a UK company for index purposes.
It is a principle of the indices that only UK companies are eligible and the
purpose of the rule change is to clarify the treatment of stapled units
which include shares in both UK and non-UK companies.
The proposed rule change involves an additional requirement that companies
eligible for membership shall pay dividends franked for UK corporation tax
purposes (or if there is currently no dividend, would do so).
Cases where shareholders may elect to receive either a franked or a
non-franked dividend (ie, where it is not mandatory, when receiving a
dividend, to receive a franked dividend) would not be eligible.
All index rule changes require to be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries Share
Indices Steering Committee which next meets on October 6, 1993.
If the proposed rule change is approved by that Steering Committee, neither
new Rothmans units nor Vendome units would be eligible for inclusion in any
of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices for the UK; 'old' Rothmans
International would remain a constituent of the indices until the
forthcoming reorganisation becomes effective.
The status of SmithKline Beecham units (which have been included in the
indices for several years) would become anomalous. Each unit consists of B
ordinary shares in the UK company (which pays no dividend) and US preference
shares of a US subsidiary which is responsible for all the dividends on the
unit; thus the unit pays a dividend which is not franked for UK corporation
tax.
The units will continue to be included in the indices while consultation
takes place with interested parties including the company and its advisors.
SmithKline Beecham A shares (whose dividends are franked) are not the
subject of such consultation and will remain a constituent of the indices.
Notes: Rule 4.9 of the Ground Rules for the Management of The UK Series
currently defines an eligible UK company as a company 'incorporated and
registered for tax purposes in the UK'.
Under the proposed revised rules, Eurotunnel plc will remain eligible for
inclusion in the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices. The weighting of Eurotunnel
plc will remain unchanged at 50 per cent of the Eurotunnel units.
                   *             *           *
Details of annual changes
The Committee approved constituent changes to be made to the FT-SE SmallCap
and FT-A All-Share after close of business on 31 December 1993. In
accordance with ground rule 4.8(c), the minimum size of constituent for
FT-SE SmallCap companies has been set at Pounds 30m.
There will be an additional 74 new companies included in the FT-SE SmallCap
Index and FT-Actuaries All-Share, with 40 existing companies being removed.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ERM turmoil behind fall at Woodchester to
IPounds 16.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, which
is 49 per cent owned by the Credit Lyonnais Group, has reported a 6.2 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits to IPounds 16.4m (Pounds 15.3m) for the six
months to June 30.
The fall reflects the turmoil in the ERM early in the year, prior to the
devaluation of the punt, which caused interest rates to soar and is
estimated to have cost Woodchester about IPounds 2.5m, similar to the final
quarter of 1992.
Mr Craig McKinney, chairman and chief executive, said 'If it hadn't been for
the ERM crisis profits would have been up on last year'. He explained that
most of the group's lending is on fixed rates, with 90 per cent of the
portfolio hedged against interest rate movements on the three-to-six month
Dublin interbank market. When short-term rates soared, Woodchester therefore
had to absorb the cost.
The result includes a first-time contribution from CLLE, the European
leasing arm of Credit Lyonnais, in which Woodchester took a 30 per cent
stake in November 1992, and which boosted profits from associated companies
by 140 per cent to IPounds 2.8m.
Mr McKinney, said, however, that new business volumes and net interest
income in CLLE's operations were below budget by 21 and 12 per cent
respectively, 'due to the generally poor economic climate throughout
Europe'.
CLLE is a strategic area for Woodchester's future development plans, by
building on its success in the UK and Irish small and middle-ticket leasing
markets, to expand throughout Europe.
Market analysts in Dublin expect CLLE's contribution to improve in 1994, and
pointed to the continuing strength of Woodchester's car leasing business in
both Ireland and the UK, where new business is up 5 per cant and 30 per cent
respectively. In Ireland this has been achieved against a backdrop of a 6
per cent decline in car registrations.
Earnings fell by 15 per cent to 6.37p (7.47p), reflecting both the fall in
pre-tax profits and a 6 per cent increase in shares in issue since 1992. A
15 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.08p (1.81p) has been
declared, which brokers said was indicative of Woodchester's confidence for
the year.
A full-year result of about IPounds 37m pre-tax and earnings of about 15.5p
are being forecast.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dutch purchase of Newey enforces European
role in electrical distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAGEMEYER, the Dutch company which has agreed to pay BTR up to Pounds 165m
for Newey &amp; Eyre Group, said the management of the Birmingham-based
electrical distributor would remain after the acquisition.
Hagemeyer, which is 63 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, is an
international trading house specialising in automobiles, consumer
electronics, speciality foods and luxury goods.
It also supplies electro-technical products.
The timing of the acquisition fits Hagemeyer's pattern of takeovers in the
field of electrical distribution. In 1989 it acquired the Dutch group
Bernard, and followed that up two years later with the purchase of a large
majority stake in Froschl of Germany.
Mr Andrew Land, chairman of Hagemeyer, said the management team of Newey had
managed to maintain a reasonable level of profit during a severe UK
recession.
The purchase comes as the British construction industry is showing signs of
emerging from recession.
Mr Land said: 'We are cautious and do not expect a very decided upturn, but
we do expect an improvement in conditions.'
Given the normal time lag of six to 12 months, Hagemeyer expected Britain's
market for electro-technical supplies to show an 'uptick' in the second half
of next year.
The acquisition of Newey will not only boost the Dutch company's turnover by
one-third to more than Fl 4.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), but it will also bring into
reach a long-standing goal of building up a significant European
electro-technical business. Its aim for the past five years has been to
generate sales of at least Fl 2.5bn per year in the electro-technical sector
by 1995.
Newey's turnover of Fl 1bn, plus existing electro-technical turnover of
nearly Fl 1.2bn, puts Hagemeyer comfortably on course to reach this goal, Mr
Land said yesterday.
Mr Land said that Hagemeyer usually takes two years to absorb and integrate
a major electro-technical acquisitions, meaning that a similar-sized deal
should not be expected for another two years. Smaller, 'rounding'
acquisitions of companies with turnover of between Fl 50m and Fl 200m are
possible, he said.
Hagemeyer expects to decide before the end of the year how it will finance
the purchase of Newey. Mr Land did not rule out a share issue but said the
decision would rest on a number of factors.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed opens shop in Japan

<TEXT>
Austin Reed, the upmarket clothing retailer, yesterday opened its first shop
in Japan, through a licensing agreement with a Japanese tailor, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The move comes as the country's prolonged economic slump has affected
consumer confidence, especially in clothing. Leading department stores have
been forced to offer cheaper suits due to the aggressive price cuts by
discount retailers, which have gained popularity as more Japanese have
started to refrain from spending.
Mr Barry Reed, chairman, said he was aware of the latest trend in the men's
clothing market, but he believed that in the long run, the Japanese would
opt for quality clothing.
Austin Reed has been available in the Japanese market for the past 20 years,
through licensing agreements with the country's apparel makers.
The company hopes to attract customers, who are familiar with its flagship
store on London's Regent Street. The outside appearance of the new shop,
located in Ginza, the luxury shopping centre of Tokyo, is modeled after the
Regent Street store and is made of the same stone material.
The retailer expects to see sales of Y70m (Pounds 430,000) in the first
year.

FRIENDLY Hotels is seeking Pounds 10m net through a 1-for-3 rights issue at
150p a share. The proceeds will be used to reduce indebtedness and

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Components side helps lift T&amp;N 14% to
Pounds 39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, boosted first half pre-tax
profits by 13.5 per cent to Pounds 39.4m in spite of what the directors
described as 'severe recessionary conditions in continental Europe.'
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said the group's automotive
component businesses had provided most of the increase, although the
bearings and friction products divisions had also made increased
contributions. He said T&amp;N had improved margins in the period to end-June
from 7.8 per cent to 8.3 per cent.
Customer demand in Europe was continuing to decline, and it would be some
time before a recovery was seen. While the UK would be hampered by the
European recession, brighter conditions were seen in North America and the
Far East.
'Much potential exists for further market share gains and margin
improvement,' he added.
Trading profits in North America, where the group now supplies all three
Japanese motor makers, were up 50 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 12.5m).
In the UK, which lifted direct exports by 8 per cent, trading profits were
18 per cent ahead at Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 20.7m).
Mr Hope said that elsewhere, in very difficult trading conditions, profits
had been maintained at similar levels to last year.
Group turnover was 8.7 per cent higher at Pounds 774.5m (Pounds 712m).
Operating profits were up by 15 per cent at Pounds 54.2m (Pounds 47.1m)
after allowing provisions of Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 8.5m) for claims related to
its former asbestos activities.
Earnings per share were 5p (4p). The group is proposing an unchanged
full-year dividend of 10.85p, payable at the interim, with the alternative
of an enhanced scrip dividend valued at 16.275p per ordinary share.
Hoare Govett is offering to buy the scrip shares for not less than 98 per
cent of face value, or about 15.95p. If all shareholders took the enhanced
dividend, T&amp;N said it would save Pounds 50m cash on dividend payments and
Pounds 14.5m on advanced corporation tax.
T&amp;N completed the DM250m (Pounds 100m) acquisition of Goetze, the German
piston ring producer, in June, when the first instalment of DM90m was paid
and 21.9m T&amp;N shares were placed to raise Pounds 37m.
Rationalising Goetze's activities were on course.
Net borrowings at June 30 were Pounds 425.5m, up from Pounds 239.2m at the
end of last year and giving gearing of 80 per cent.
COMMENT
Given the prevailing trading conditions in the motor sector, this is a very
good set of results. Raising margins in this climate is a rare feat which
shows that the drive to cut costs and boost market share is paying off. T&amp;N
has kept its shareholders loyal during a near-decade of restructuring by
offering them a high yield. Their cup runs over with payment of an enhanced
scrip dividend in full at the interim stage. Holders of the stock this
calendar year will enjoy a yield near 10 per cent. Questions remain over who
will hang on when the shares go ex-dividend - yield fund managers will
certainly start to look elsewhere as they stare at a less prosperous 1994.
But it could mark the transformation of T&amp;N from a yield stock to a growth
stock.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella hits Pounds 63m and keeps an
eye on China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS Viyella, the textiles and clothing company, is hoping to reduce
gearing by 20 per cent by enticing preference shareholders to convert to
ordinary stock with an enhanced dividend.
The offer of a scrip dividend was announced as the group unveiled a 35 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 46.4m). Turnover
rose to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1bn).
Profits were helped by a Pounds 7.2m gain from the lower pound and a 50 per
cent increase in UK operating profits to Pounds 20.8m.
Following a series of acquisitions and joint ventures borrowings rose to
Pounds 503m (Pounds 474.5m) representing gearing of 62 per cent. This is
expected to fall to around 45 per cent by the year end.
However, this could be cut by another 20 per cent if the 119m preference
shareholders convert to ordinary stock in order to take advantage of the
scrip dividend. Its value of 4.875p compares with the declared ordinary
interim dividend of 3.25p (3p). For each share offered under the issue
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is offering cash of 4.7775p.
The shares yesterday rose 1p to 257p. The group is confident that the stock
will remain above the preference shareholder conversion level of 251p until
the end of the month.
If the scrip is taken up by shareholders it will save the company Pounds 25m
which will be used to invest in the company's joint ventures in China.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said: 'We have already signed six joint
ventures and are confident of clinching more shortly. There are enormous
opportunities in China; there are 1.2bn people who are not fully clothed.'
Mainland Europe was the only area where profits fell. Mr Bain blamed the
deepening recession for the decline in Continental profits to Pounds 12m
(Pounds 19m) and said further rationalisation would take place in the second
half.
Earnings per share rose to 5.9p (4.3p).
COMMENT
Coats Viyella's scrip dividend is worthy of support since the company is
pin-pointing specific investment in China which should offer a good rate of
return. With net cash inflow from normal operating activities jumping from
Pounds 13m to Pounds 52m shareholders are not being asked to shore up the
balance sheet. Borrowings are likely to fall sharply by the year end as
preference shareholders convert to ordinary stock to qualify for the
enhanced payout. That would give the company more headroom to build on its
investment in China and make further strategic acquisitions. Forecast annual
pre-tax profits of Pounds 150m put the shares are on a prospective multiple
of 17.7. With further gains from the devaluation of sterling to flow through
the shares still look attractive on a premium rating.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bird fight puts heat on Booker - Slight
decrease to Pounds 30m and cautious note sounded on second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food distribution and agribusiness group, yesterday reported a
slight decrease in interim profits and sounded a downbeat note about the
outlook for the second half.
Mr Jonathan Taylor, chairman, said: 'Overall, current trading is
satisfactory but . . . we remain cautious for the year as a whole.'
Mr Taylor said he was concerned about the group's Arbor Acres chickens farms
in the US, which were facing increasing competition, and the possible
adverse impact on consumer confidence in the UK of November's budget.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds 29.9m in the six months to
June 12, although the previous period was flattered by a Pounds 5.3m gain on
disposals. Sales rose from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 1.5bn and operating
profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 38.9m.
In spite of sluggish trading conditions, Booker said effective action had
been taken to increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs, so margins
had improved slightly.
Food distribution profits recovered strongly from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds
19.2m. Sales in cash and carry started to improve during the second quarter
and this trend was improving.
More important were the cost savings resulting from the extension of
information technology throughout the depot system. The total group
workforce fell by 1,340 to 21,000, with most of the job losses occuring in
cash and carry.
Booker Fitch Food services improved profits as a result of tighter operation
control. Its biggest fast-food contracts had been concentrated into two
dedicated depots, reducing costs. However, the catering market remained
dull.
Within food distribution, current trading was improving, but the group said
it was not possible to predict the impact of the next budget, which would
come before the peak Christmas period.
Profits from fish and prepared foods were static at Pounds 9.6m (Pounds
9.8m). The group said it was difficult to secure price increases from
supermarkets to compensate for higher costs.
Agribusiness profits fell to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 10.1m). In the UK,
McConnell Salmon had returned to profit and other businesses were benefiting
from sterling's devaluation.
Earnings fell to 10.5p (12.2p), although excluding exceptionals they rose
from 10.42p to 10.51p. The interim dividend was held at 7.5p.
COMMENT
The preference of US consumers for chickens with lots of white meat is
hurting Booker, which breeds birds with more dark meat than the competition.
It will be 1995 before a suitable female bird is ready, so the pain could
continue for some time. Meanwhile, the success of rationalising food
distribution shows that Mr Charles Bowen, the recently appointed chief
executive, has plenty of scope for improving controls further. The shares
are on a prospective multiple of 13, a 15 per cent discount to the market
and just below the food sector's rating. A maintained dividend looks
assured. The shares, down 9p to 432p, are underpinned by a prospective
premium yield of more than 6 per cent, but are unlikely to advance until the
new man shows his hand.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lower provisions help DY Davies cut losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at DY Davies, the USM-quoted architect, were cut from Pounds 1.67m to
Pounds 684,000 pre-tax for the 12 months ended April 30.
The figures were helped by a reduction in exceptional provisions to Pounds
553,000 (Pounds 950,000) and lower interest costs of Pounds 259,000 (Pounds
287,000).
Turnover improved to Pounds 7.36m (Pounds 7.29m) and at the operating level
there was a swing from losses of Pounds 430,000 to profits of Pounds
128,000. Losses per share emerged at 11.5p (21.8p).
Directors said the industry was still in the grip of recession, construction
prices were down, fee bidding was competitive and demand was low.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reverse for Ford leaves Gowrings in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH TURNOVER down from Pounds 26.84m to Pounds 25.69m, Gowrings, the motor
dealer and leisure group, suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 137,000 for the
first six months of 1993, against Pounds 172,000 profits.
Mr John Fowles, chairman, stated that the two Ford dealerships experienced
'a most difficult six months' trading'. He explained that Ford's loss of
market share, together with an erosion of new car margins and reduced
manufacturer's incentives, 'had a dramatic effect on our results'.
The leisure division produced doubled trading profits for the period of
Pounds 187,000 (Pounds 90,000) while the motor side made just Pounds 3,000
(Pounds 270,000).
Losses per share were 1.84p against 1.62p earnings and the interim dividend
is unchanged at 1p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: NFC surges to Pounds 116m and plans
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport group, yesterday announced a restructuring to focus on
two core businesses which will lead to a management shake-up.
It also reported that pre-tax profits had jumped to Pounds 116.3m (Pounds
59.3m) for the 40 weeks to July 10 on the back of the sale of Waste
Management and property disposals.
The restructuring package is part of a strategic review due to be completed
by the year end. The news was welcome in the City and the shares rose 3p to
270p on a day the market fell.
The UK BRS transport operations and Exel Logistics, the distribution and
storage business, are to be merged. While on the international side,
relocations and removals are to be expanded.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'The transport businesses were becoming
more similar making it sensible to integrate them. The move will give rise
to significant cost savings.'
Before exceptionals profits edged up to Pounds 62.3m (Pounds 61.5m).
Operating profit rose 14 per cent to Pounds 79.2m as sales increased 11 per
cent to Pounds 1.4bn.
The full-year profit is projected at Pounds 95m, the lower end of previously
indicated 'best view' range. In the future it will not issue best view
ranges after taking legal advice.
Mr Watson said trading remained difficult in mainland Europe, particularly
in Germany and Spain, while UK recovery was proving patchy.
Provisions will cover the rationalisation which will be taken as an
exceptional charge at the year end. However, Mr Watson declined to say how
much it will cost or what benefits the change will bring in cost savings.
The group would continue to keep its other businesses, such as truck rental
and car leasing, and had stemmed the losses at Links, the parcels business.
Mr Watson hopes the refocusing will enable the group to expand its
international relocations and removals network. 'We are the biggest player
with above 5 per cent of a market worth up to Pounds 7bn.'
Mr Robbie Burns, managing director of Logistics is to take charge of the
expanded transport business; Mr Graham Roberts moves from transport to
become managing director of European operations and Mr Denis Olliver moves
from Home Services to become managing director of International projects.
Earnings per share rose to 17.5p (8.3p), although they were unchanged at
8.5p before exceptionals.
The third interim dividend is raised to 1.6p (1.55p).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Laing declines to Pounds 5.1m mid-term -
Constructor blames downturn on delays in government spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS in government spend-ing and costs previously held off the balance
sheet contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits at John Laing from Pounds
5.6m to Pounds 5.1m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover at the construction company fell to Pounds 590.2m (Pounds 596.6m)
as public sector work declined.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said: 'Are ministers going to take the easy
option and chop major capital expenditure projects, or are they going to
grasp the nettle and go for the revenue side?'
A Pounds 4m interest charge on Pounds 40m borrowings on a Belfast
development, previously held off-balance sheet, turned net interest receipts
of Pounds 900,000 last time into a charge of Pounds 1.2m. The development
contributed Pounds 2.4m to group operating profits of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds
4.7m).
Laing has a further Pounds 15.2m of off-balance sheet borrowings, held in
three joint ventures and paying their own interest charges. It has net cash
of Pounds 53.7m (Pounds 10m) following its Pounds 39m share placing in June.
Laing's US housing business made deeper operating losses of Pounds 3.6m
(Pounds 1.5m), reflecting a Pounds 2.7m land write-down, while UK housing
made a Pounds 500,000 operating profit (losses Pounds 1.6m).
Laing sold a total of 1,224 (792) housing units and expects to meet its
full-year target of 2,410 (2,175). UK land prices are rising about 5 per
cent over the full year as competition for smaller sites increased.
Mr Laing is not anticipating 'major price rises' on housing units but said
the cost of consumer incentives fell about 1 per cent over the half year.
Operating profits from construction struck mainly in the 'deteriorating' UK
market fell to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 8.4m). Laing will resist tendering at
'unrealistic prices'.
Higher margin construction contracts won in the 1980s are almost complete
and Laing is aiming to increase its proportion of overseas orders, now about
20 per cent of turnover, where operating margins average 10 per cent
compared with a 2.5 per cent peak in the UK.
Property and investments returned Pounds 4.6m profits (losses Pounds
600,000).
The interim dividend is being maintained at 3p covered by earnings of 4.1p
(4.5p).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reduced Pounds 125,000 loss for Roxspur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 125,000 were announced by Roxspur, maker
and installer of playground equipment, street furniture and rubber safety
surfacing, for the year ended May 31. For the previous 14 months there were
restated losses of Pounds 755,000.
Mr Ian Orrock, chairman, said the fall in turnover from Pounds 5.46m to
Pounds 4.18m reflected the uncertainty surrounding the future of the group
during the first half, together with the scale of the recession, competitive
conditions and the uncertainty in the local authority sector of the group's
market.
The pre-tax result was after exceptional cost of sales of Pounds 180,000
relating to works required to correct a substantial number of manufacturing
and installation problems and an exceptional Pounds 60,000 for
rationalisation and reorganisation costs.
Losses per share fell to 0.9p (13.6p).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth at British Dredging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress all round coupled with much higher net margins enabled British
Dredging to raise pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds 578,000 to
Pounds 739,000 in the first half of 1993.
Turnover of the building materials, ship repairing and concrete products
group, rose only 7 per cent to Pounds 17.35m. Mr Fane Vernon, chairman, said
this increase was entirely due to the full six months' contribution from the
604 builders merchants business which was acquired in March 1992 and from
Selco's Cardiff branch - opened in July 1992.
Operating profits grew 83 per cent to Pounds 655,000. Net interest received
was lower at Pounds 84,000 (Pounds 306,000) because of the group's
investment in new branches of JT Edwards and Selco Trade Centres and reduced
interest rates.
Last time there was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 85,000. Earnings
per share increased from 2.2p to 2.83p, while an unchanged interim dividend
of 2.6p is declared.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: JIB Group advances to Pounds 11.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JIB GROUP, the insurance broker, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.7m for the first six months of 1993.
Earnings per share were up 12 per cent to 6.5p (5.8p). The interim dividend
is unchanged at 2.5p.
Turnover from insurance broking increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 100.6m
,with about half the increase attributable to the strength of the US dollar
in the period compared to last year. Income from the Lloyd's members' agency
fell to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 1.3m). Investment income was Pounds 8.4m
(Pounds 9.5m).
Mr John Barton, chief executive, said that JIB had set aside Pounds 250,000
to meet costs arising from litigation involving its Lloyd's members' agency.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs leave Arjo 36% lower at
Pounds 63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits for the first six months to June 30 down 36 per cent from
Pounds 99.1m to Pounds 63m.
Earnings per share fell 52 per cent from 7.5p to 3.6p. This was partly
because of lower selling prices, but also a Pounds 14.6m provision for
restructuring at the Cesea Spanish pulp and forestry operations and the
German Buhl decorative paper business.
A quarter of the workforce at Cesea will be cut, and Buhl's mill at
Ettlingen is being closed. Without the restructuring costs, earnings per
share fell 28 per cent to 5.4p.
The company also booked an Pounds 8.8m loss on foreign currency loans for
the Portuguese Soporcel operations following the devaluation of the escudo.
Since June there have been further devaluations. The interim dividend was
unchanged at 2.65p.
Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the business climate continued to be arduous.
Recovery in the US and UK remained subdued and uneven. Poor demand in
continental Europe and overcapacity affecting several product ranges would
continue to restrict the group's profit recovery prospects until at least
the second half of next year.
The company intends to secure a listing on the Paris Bourse later this year.
Mr Stenham said the aim of the listing would be to widen AWA's shareholder
base. The undue influence of AWA's minority French shareholders have caused
concern among some UK institutions.
The results were achieved on turnover up 10 per cent from Pounds 1.3bn to
Pounds 1.43bn. At constant exchange rates, sales volumes were up 1 per cent,
but prices fell 5 per cent. Operating profits, including the exceptional
items, dropped from Pounds 112m to Pounds 89m.
European paper manufacturing turnover increased from Pounds 637m to Pounds
676m, but fell 8 per cent at constant exchange rates. Cost savings only
partly offset price cuts, leading to trading profits down from Pounds 51m to
Pounds 25m after the exceptional restructuring costs.
The Appleton North American operations' trading profits rose 34 per cent to
Pounds 71.4m, or 12 per cent in dollar terms. US paper operations increased
their sales 4 per cent from Dollars 519m to Dollars 540m.
Debt increased to Pounds 351m, compared with Pounds 286m a year earlier
thanks to high capital expenditure of Pounds 98m and the take up of shares
during a Soporcel rights issue. Interest costs increased from Pounds 12.2m
to Pounds 18.8m.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Christies benefits from weaker pound and
improves to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S depreciation helped Christies International, the auctioneer, to
advance pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.11m to Pounds 7.06m in the six months
to June 30.
Sir Anthony Tennant, its new chairman, said: 'A substantial proportion of
this increase is associated with the effect of sterling's depreciation
during the last year, but it is pleasing to note that underlying sales grew
by 4 per cent in the period.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 64.8m (Pounds 51.4m), helped by a Pounds 5.65m
first-time contribution from Spink &amp; Son, the fine art dealer acquired in
April.
Sir Anthony said: 'While we are encouraged by these signs of improvement, we
are seeing relatively modest results in certain other categories where some
owners have been slow to regain the confidence to consign works of art to
the market.' Cost controls had contributed to the profits improvement, with
last year's efficiency programme continuing to bring benefits. The increase
in March of the 'buyer's premium', a commission paid on purchases, had
improved margins.
Sales growth had been strengthened by demand for 19th and 20th century
pictures, with impressionist and modern pictures achieving a 57 per cent
increase.
The company said highlights included Monet's La jetee du Havre, which sold
for Dollars 9.7m (Pounds 6.29m) in New York and Renoir's Jeune Fille portant
une Corbeille de Fleurs, which fetched Dollars 5.7m in London.
Jewellery sales had also improved substantially, as did volume in a number
of decorative art departments. Demand also hardened in the middle market,
with sales at Christie's South Kensington rising by 22 per cent.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p. Earnings per share were 2.51p
(0.7p).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Swallowfield rises 24% to Pounds 522,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SWALLOWFIELD, the aerosol and cosmetics manufacturer, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 522,000, against Pounds 421,000, in the
24 weeks to June 19. Turnover rose 40 per cent from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds
12m.
Mr Tony Wardell, managing director, said that within the encouraging
performance the results of individual companies were mixed. Aerosols
continued to provide most of the turnover and profits and reported a 30 per
cent rise in volume but only 12 per cent in value.
In cosmetics, the UK side increased profits but the Belgian-based
manufacturer had yet to be turned round.
The pre-tax figure was after increased interest charges of Pounds 344,000
(Pounds 256,000). Earnings per share were 2.6p (2.2p). The interim dividend
is held at 2.2p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Halved interest costs help Manders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HALVING of the interest charge helped Manders, the Wolverhampton paint,
inks and property group, lift pre-tax profits 21 per cent to Pounds 4.92m in
the six months to June 30.
Interest payable tumbled to Pounds 965,000 (Pounds 1.94m) in the wake of
lower rates and a fall in borrowings to Pounds 20.5m at the end of the half,
against Pounds 29.6m previously.
Mr Roger Akers, chief executive, suggested that borrowings would have been
lower, but for the 13.8 per cent rise to Pounds 52.4m in the turnover of
continuing operations and the need for stock at Wickes, the 70-strong DIY
multiple, where Manders started delivering own-brand paint in March.
The group also announced that it was marketing the Mander Centre in response
to 'unsolicited approaches'. It was valued in December 1991 at Pounds 57.5m.
Mr Akers said that, even if it was not sold soon, Manders would continue to
look for acquisitions in Europe in paints and, especially, inks.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 55.2m, against Pounds 56.1m, though the latter
figure included Pounds 7.55m from discontinued activities. Operating profits
were Pounds 5.88m (Pounds 5.77m) with the coatings and inks division rising
to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 1.43m) on turnover of Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 19.8m)
and the decorative side making Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 1.72m) on sales of
Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 26.3m).
The interim dividend is lifted to 2.9p (2.6p), payable from earnings per
share of 9.02p (7.74p).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Carr Kitcat slims broking of UK stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARR, Kitcat &amp; Aitken, one of the oldest names in British stockbroking, will
announce today that it is to radically cut back its broking of UK stocks.
The company, part of Banque Indosuez's WI Carr Group, will continue its
private client stockbroking business, under the name of Carr Sheppards.
It will also maintain its research and broking of foreign stocks,
particularly Asian securities, to UK institutional clients, under the WI
Carr name. The announcement will be made today, according to an Indosuez
executive.
Banque Indosuez acquired WI Carr from British Commonwealth's Exco in 1987.
When Kitcat &amp; Aitken was shut by its parent, Royal Bank of Canada, in 1990,
WI Carr took on 24 salesmen, dealers and analysts (13 of them Kitcat
directors), and acquired the name.
Indosuez, one of the largest subsidiaries of Suez, the French industrial and
financial group, suffered an 87 per cent drop in net profits in 1992, to
FFr101m (Pounds 12.2m) because of economic slowdown and the property slump
in Paris.
Indosuez is floating 51 per cent of its holding in Gartmore, the UK fund
management company. In early 1991, Banque Indosuez injected up to Pounds 20m
of extra capital into Carr Kitcat to satisfy UK regulators that the broker
could withstand potential losses from Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of
Polly Peck International.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: LUI liabilities may reach Dollars 9bn
during next 40 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL LIABILITIES of the insurance subsidiaries of London United
Investments, the insurance holding group which crashed in 1990, could amount
to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn), it emerged yesterday.
Provisional liquidators of the Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street
and Mutual Reinsurance subsidiaries (best known by the KWELM acronym)
provided the new figures when they yesterday proposed a scheme of
arrangement for the policyholders and creditors of the companies, numbering
more than 100,000.
The liquidators, Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, say
that the proposed scheme is intended to speed partial payment of agreed
claims. Initially they will pay between 3p and 12p in the pound, an amount
which they hope will eventually rise to 40p.
The KWELM companies specialised in direct liability insurance written for
North American corporations and professionals, together with reinsurance of
similar business by other insurers.
'To some extent it is an unfortunate aggregation of the least attractive
business which was around at the time,' said Mr Hughes.
Losses stem mainly from court awards in product liability, asbestos,
environmental, medical malpractice and professional indemnity claims on
policies underwritten between 1972 and 1980.
Current best estimates of the companies' unsecured liabilities are about
Dollars 5bn - however most claims are not yet known or agreed and the
overall figure could rise to Dollars 9bn during the next 20 to 40 years.
KWELM Management Services, the company set up by the liquidators to pay
claims, will be able to reduce these liabilities through reinsurance
recoveries. It expects an ultimate deficiency in the range of Dollars 3bn to
Dollars 5bn.
Of the estimated claims it is expected that about Dollars 1bn will be paid
to policyholders who may be eligible for protection by the Policyholders'
Protection Board, including certain lawyers, doctors, accountants and other
professional partnerships and individuals.
Currently the KWELM companies have nearly Dollars 500m theoretically
available for distribution. The liquidators have collected or secured more
than Dollars 280m since their appointment, including about Dollars 180m in
reinsurance.
Creditors are being asked to vote on the scheme proposals at a meeting to be
held at the Alexandra Palace in London on 17 November.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tax credit helps lift Enterprise to Pounds
80.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Oil, one of Britain's leading independent oil exploration and
production companies, yesterday announced a jump in interim net profits from
Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 80.1m, thanks to a large tax credit, increased
production and sterling's depreciation.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, warned, however, that a
majority of Enterprise's 1993 profits had accrued in the first half because
of special factors and weaker second half oil prices.
A credit of Pounds 27m resulted from the abolition in last March's budget of
Petroleum Revenue Tax on past exploration and appraisal expenditure. The
rise in production to 157,430 barrels a day of oil equivalent (135,500 b/d)
was above market expectations.
An interim cash dividend of 9.5p (6.5p) was declared - the same level as
last year's final. The policy of reversing the relative sizes of the
dividends would apply for this year only, according to the company. Earnings
per share were 15.8p (7.9p), after tax of Pounds 0.5m (Pounds 16.3m).
Enterprise joined the raft of companies offering enhanced scrip dividends to
reduce their surplus advanced corporation tax. Shareholders are entitled to
a dividend in new shares worth 14.25p per share. SG Warburg is offering to
buy the shares at a minimum of 13.965p per share.
Mr Andrew Shilston, the newly appointed group finance director, estimated
the company would save Pounds 13.2m in cash if all shareholders took the
scrip alternative.
However, the company expects higher production rates to continue. The Scott
field began producing ahead of schedule last week, with output due to reach
175,000 b/d later this month. Production from the Nelson field should begin
in the first quarter of 1994. Total Enterprise output should rise to 250,000
b/d by 1995.
Exploration and appraisal expenditure fell to Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 44.4m) in
the first half to June 30. Mr Shilston said test results of the Monte Alpi-3
in Italy were encouraging.
The lower spending helped to boost operating profits to Pounds 65.9m (Pounds
42.3m). Turnover was up 22 per cent to Pounds 292.7m (Pounds 239.5m).

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Shield Diagnostics raises Pounds 5m through
30% placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIELD Diagnostics, the Dundee-based biotechnology company, yesterday raised
more than Pounds 5m through a placing of about 30 per cent of its shares
with institutions and private investors.
Allied Provincial Securities, which handled the issue, said 5.5m ordinary
shares had been placed at 112p.
After the placing 18.6m shares are in issue, giving the company a market
capitalisation of Pounds 20.82m.
About half the shares were placed with nine institutions, with the remainder
going to private investors. They begin trading on the London Stock Exchange
on September 23.
In addition, 358,690 ordinary shares were placed on behalf of some directors
and employees to raise Pounds 401,734 before expenses.
No other existing shareholders have realised their investment.
A group of venture capitalists, including Apax Partners, Summa and Cygnus
Ventures, held 90 per cent of the stock before the flotation and now hold 57
per cent.
The net proceeds of Pounds 5.24m will be used to clear the group's
borrowings of about Pounds 500,000, and to provide working capital to allow
further product acquisition and development.
Shield, which makes 65 per cent of its sales outside the UK, specialises in
developing, making and marketing in vitro tests for human disease.
It is a rarity among biotechnology companies that have come to the market
recently in that it already has 23 products for sale.
The company made no profits forecast and gave no notional dividend in its
prospectus.
In the year to the end of March it had a total turnover of Pounds 1.68m,
compared with a previous Pounds 445,000. Gross profits were Pounds 1.1m
(Pounds 305,000). After net operating expenses of Pounds 1.74m (Pounds
1.69m) and interest payments, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 653,000, cut from
Pounds 1.43m in the previous year.
Mr Gordon Hall, the chief executive who was recruited from Abbot Diagnostics
of the US, insisted that Shield was different from other UK biotechnology
groups as it already has commercial products and established marketing and
licensing agreements.
Last year Shield acquired products from Northumbrian Biologicals which
increased its turnover by Pounds 684,000 and gross profit by Pounds 460,000.
Mr Hall said the group, which has high fixed overheads, was seeking further
product acquisitions.
In addition to further developments of its existing range of products, the
group has high hopes for two projects now under development.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RTZ shows its mettle with advance to Pounds
339m - Results at top end of analysts' expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, 'showed its considerable resilience
in combating difficult trading conditions,' by reporting a 15 per cent
increase in half year pre-tax profits despite an average 11.5 per cent fall
in metal prices.
The results were at the top end of analysts' forecasts and RTZ's share price
rose 7p to end the day at 725p.
Profit before tax rose from Pounds 295m to Pounds 339m. Net attributable
earnings, which RTZ suggests is usually the most relevant measure of its
performance, surged from Pounds 128m to Pounds 264m.
Earnings per share were up from 12.4p to 25.6p. However, adjusted earnings,
which reflect underlying performance by excluding exceptional items, were up
by a more modest amount, from Pounds 158m to Pounds 186m, or from 15.3p a
share to 18p.
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman, warned that it may be some time before metal
prices showed any meaningful improvement from present depressed levels and a
more widespread improvement in economic activity was needed for volume
growth in industrial minerals.
Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said first half results had benefited by
Pounds 50m from exchange rates, arising principally from the devaluation of
sterling and a weaker Australian dollar, whereas lower metal prices reduced
earnings by Pounds 43m.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations increased from Pounds 236m to
Pounds 315m.
A Pounds 536m rise in net debt to Pounds 1.58bn in the first half reflected
the cost of the Nerco and Cordero US coal acquisitions. Asset disposals had
reduced this to 14 per cent and gearing would be even lower by the year-end.
Sir Derek is to give up executive responsibilities at the 1994 annual
meeting when he will be 64 to become non-executive chairman.
He said RTZ was in very good health. 'How many companies could see a near-60
per cent fall in its product prices since the peak in 1988 and still produce
these results and throw off all this cash?'
COMMENT
It has been a hectic half year for RTZ, what with buying about 5 per cent of
the US coal industry, selling most of the Pillar business and other assets.
The share price last night seemed to be assuming there is more wheeling and
dealing to come in the second half. This seems very unlikely and RTZ will
have to work very hard indeed to match in the second half, or in 1994, what
was undoubtedly an impressive first-half performance. There is no more
dividend to come this year and, while most metal prices do not have much
further to fall, copper, the most important one in the portfolio, might drop
another 20 per cent from today's 86 cents a lb. And every 10 cent a lb fall
would cost RTZ about Pounds 53m. In its present form RTZ is probably capable
of earning 90p a share at the peak of the metals cycle, so there will be a
better time to buy. It is a question of getting the timing right.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jigsaw theory proves a puzzle - Cadbury
Schweppes latest US move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes' proposed Dollars 334m (Pounds 217m) acquisition of A&amp;W
Brands, the biggest US producer of root beer, has filled out part of the
jigsaw which the British confectionery and beverages group has been
assembling on the other side of the Atlantic.
But the deal, which comes three weeks after Cadbury snapped up 20 per cent
of Dr Pepper, the third largest US soft drinks company, has left observers
puzzling over the eventual grand design.
As one industry analyst put it yesterday: 'Either Cadbury has a secret
master plan for the US market and has really thought out all the moves in
advance. Or else the company is just grabbing at opportunities as they come
up and hoping everything will come right in the end.'
A&amp;W's sales last year of Dollars 130.8m are a fraction of the Dollars 47bn
US soft drinks market. But the acquisition would be a sizeable leap for
Cadbury, raising its US market share to 5.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent and
increasing its worldwide soft drinks volumes by 20 per cent.
Cadbury believes A&amp;W's brands, which include cream soda and citrus- and
ginger-flavoured products, would give it more weight with independent
bottlers. It also sees scope for cost savings and says the acquisition of
A&amp;W, which has an operating margin of 20 per cent, would enhance cash flow
after the first year.
Still, A&amp;W offers only a small step towards the US presence which Cadbury
thinks it needs to present itself as a credible global player in soft
drinks. Dr Pepper, with its 10.4 per cent share of the US market, remains
the best hope of fulfilling that objective.
However, it is still unclear how that hope can be fulfilled. Last week, Dr
Pepper installed a 'poison pill' to deter Cadbury from raising its stake
above its current level of 25.9 per cent and has responded coolly to calls
by the UK group for talks on closer co-operation.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, put a brave face on these rebuffs yesterday.
He said that he had not been surprised by the poison pill and that Cadbury
was still on speaking terms with Dr Pepper, which bottles most of its soft
drinks concentrates and distributes some of its brands in the US.
He said Cadbury's intentions were not hostile and it had not so far asked
for a seat on Dr Pepper's board. A bid for the rest of the company was 'not
on the cards' at present, though Mr David Jinks, Cadbury's finance director,
said pooling the companies' US drinks businesses in return for a bigger
stake in Dr Pepper could be an option eventually.
However, Cadbury could not point to any imminent breakthrough in an apparent
stalemate which has left it with more than Pounds 150m pounds invested in a
company over which it exercises no management control and on which it is
receiving no dividend.
Almost as perplexing to some observers is Cadbury's renewed interest in the
US at a time when growth of the overall soft drinks market has slowed
sharply - though the non-cola segment in which the company competes has
fared much better.
Two years ago, Cadbury transferred its worldwide beverage headquarters from
the US to London. The move, which led to the resignation of Mr Jim Schadt as
head of the business, was widely seen as reflecting a shift in emphasis to
markets closer to home.
The company is believed at about the same time to have considered, but
decided against, making a takeover bid for Dr Pepper. Last spring, Cadbury
executives were talking of the company's small residual holding in Dr Pepper
as a financial investment, which was likely to be unwound.
Yesterday, Mr Cadbury said the recently enlarged holding in the US company
was a long-term investment. But while it has yet to show a tangible returns,
there was a 32 per cent rise in profits.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Blue Circle grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST-CUTTING helped Blue Circle Industries, Britain's biggest cement
manufacturer, achieve a 31 per cent increase in first-half profits before
exceptional items.
The building materials and home products group reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 60.5m for the six months to June 30, compared with profits before
exceptional items of Pounds 46.3m.
In the 1992 first half, exceptional gains of Pounds 40.1m, mainly from
disposals, lifted pre-tax profits, restated under FRS 3 accounting rules, to
Pounds 86.4m.
Earnings in the latest period came to 5p, against 4.1p in 1992 before
exceptionals and 10.2p including the exceptional profits.
The share price added 14p to 284p.
Operating profits before net interest payments of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds
12.6m) increased by almost a third to Pounds 77.9m (Pounds 58.9m). Turnover
grew to Pounds 798.8m (Pounds 570.4m).
Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director, said he was 'pleased but by
no means satisfied' with the improved operating results. He added: 'Market
conditions are now showing some signs of improvement, in both the UK and the
US.'
The heavy building materials division, comprising the cement, concretes and
aggregates businesses, raised profits to Pounds 53m (Pounds 42.8m), on sales
of Pounds 353.5m (Pounds 296.4m).
Operating profits at Blue Circle Cement (BCC) in the UK fell to Pounds
12.7m, compared with Pounds 15.9m before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.6m in
the year-ago period. BCC's sales volume slipped by 5 per cent to 2.9m
tonnes, reflecting weaker construction output and cement demand.
However, Mr James Loudon, finance director, said the price increases
introduced in June had largely recovered the erosion over the previous year.
He also noted that the rationalisation programme announced in June,
involving capacity cuts and a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce, had
been completed and savings would be reflected in second-half results.
Blue Circle America, which is focused on the south-eastern US, boosted
operating profits to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 1.9m).
In the home products division, profits grew by a modest 5 per cent to Pounds
24.2m (Pounds 23.1m) despite a near doubling in turnover to Pounds 396m
(199.8m) partly reflecting the acquisition last year of Celsius, the French
and German central heating businesses.
Net debt at June 30 stood at Pounds 385m, down from Pounds 405m at the end
of December and represented gearing of 38 per cent.
COMMENT
The cynic might argue that Blue Circle is merely reaping the rewards of its
substantial provisions in previous years. Nevertheless, the restructuring of
the BCC operations has substantially reduced costs just as the cycle appears
to be turning. In contrast, the lacklustre performance of the continental
heating businesses again highlights the unfortunate timing of the Celsius
purchase and accompanying rights issue. However, pre-tax profits should rise
to about Pounds 155m this year, producing earnings of about 13.6p and a
prospective p/e of about 21. This is a classic recovery stock.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo still confident of Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERPINNING Glaxo's continuing success over the last year has been its
ability to continue to expand Zantac, its ulcer treatment and the first
medicine to break the Pounds 2bn sales barrier.
In spite of the scale of the drug's sales, underlying growth, excluding
exchange rates, increased by 11 per cent, a performance described by Dr
Richard Sykes, chief executive, as quite remarkable.
Dr Sykes said Glaxo's long-established position in the US with bulk
purchasers of medicines had enabled Zantac's underlying growth from that
source to reach 13 per cent in the year to June 30.
Although underlying sales in Europe were up only 6 per cent - healthcare
reforms in Germany and Italy cut sales by 10 per cent and 5 per cent
respectively - those in the rest of the world increased by 19 per cent.
Considerable attention had been paid to the recent challenge to Zantac's
patents by US generic companies, said Dr Sykes. However, even if Glaxo lost
the cases, no generic version would be on the market before 1996.
There were other issues which could affect Zantac before the patents issue
was resolved, Dr Sykes admitted.
The most immediate threat was presented by the expiry next year of the
patents of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, Zantac's main US competitor. Zantac
would have to compete with generic versions of this drug.
Even SmithKline Beecham's senior executives are divided over the likely
impact.
The main threat from generics would appear to be in the managed care sector,
rather than the retail sector where patients pay for their own medicines and
are used to taking Zantac.
In the managed sector, Dr Sykes said Zantac was already holding its own
against low-price Tagamet. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of generic
versions could hold back their sales, he added.
Even if Glaxo wins its patent case, generics companies will theoretically be
able to market an earlier version of the drug from 1996. However, Dr Sykes
played down the threat. There were regulatory problems for generics
manufacturers because the earlier version had not previously been licensed.
In addition, it was unstable and difficult to manufacture.
Dr Sykes admitted that Zantac's sales would be affected by the introduction
of over-the-counter non-prescription versions of Tagamet and Pepcid, Merck's
counterpart.
An FDA advisory committee met yesterday to discuss SmithKline Beecham's
application. However, any impact would be marginal.
Other threats include the eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium
which has recently been discovered to be implicated in ulcers. If doctors
decided to eradicate the bug rather than prescribe Zantac type drugs, the
market could collapse.
Dr Sykes said this issue had still to be resolved and the company was
working on its own eradication therapy.
The company is planning applications for new illnesses, such as ulcers
generated by anti-arthritic drugs, and new slow-release formulations. Dr
Sykes insisted that in spite of the all the threats, Zantac's franchise had
a positive future.
Meanwhile, Glaxo has also launched a number of new products in an effort to
reduce the dependence on Zantac. The new drugs, Serevent, Flixonase and
Flixotide, the asthma treatments, Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment,
Imigran, the migraine drug, Lacipil, a heart drug, and Cutivate, a skin
cream, generated sales of Pounds 592m.
Dr Sykes said the performance of the new drugs was very creditable given
that Serevent and Flixotide were only now going on sale and that Imigran had
only just been launched in the US and had already achieved sales of Pounds
116m (Pounds 43m).
The star new drug, said Dr Sykes, had been Zofran which had generated
revenues of Pounds 365m after only three years on the market. The treatment
was not yet available in Japan, but he hoped it would be given approval
during the fiscal year.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Glaxo increases dividend by 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 17 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30, up from Pounds 1.42bn
to Pounds 1.67bn.
The results were helped by robust performances from Zantac, the world's
best-selling medicine, and recently introduced products. Advantageous
exchange rates contributed to the improvement.
The Glaxo board surprised the market with a 29 per cent dividend increase.
It proposed a final dividend of 15p, making a total of 22p (against 17p) for
the year. Glaxo's shares rose 27p to 628p.
Glaxo's cash mountain continued to grow. Liquid funds available for
investment increased from Pounds 1.332bn to Pounds 1.815bn. However, Mr John
Coombe, finance director, said that in view of the uncertain conditions in
the healthcare environment, the company was not in a hurry to spend.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive, said doubts remained over the future of
Zantac, sales of which rose 20 per cent to Pounds 2.172bn. At constant
exchange rates, the growth was 11 per cent. The drugs' patents are being
challenged and it faces increasing competition.
Dr Sykes said he did not expect US healthcare reforms to have a significant
impact on Glaxo's business. The company generated more than Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) in the US. Nearly half of that was already through the
managed care system that President Bill Clinton was hoping to encourage, Dr
Sykes said.
Expenditure on research and development increased 24 per cent to Pounds
739m, making the group the world's largest spender on drugs R&amp;D. The company
said it expected R&amp;D spending to increase to Pounds 850m in the coming year.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 650m, up 15 per cent. It had probably peaked,
Dr Sykes said.
Group turnover increased 20 per cent from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.9bn and
operating profits were up 18 per cent from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.525bn.
At constant exchange rates, they rose 11 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively.
Earnings per share increased 16 per cent from 34.3p to 39.9p. Earnings per
American Depositary Receipt increased 7 per cent from Dollars 1.21 to
Dollars 1.29.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Cadbury rises 32% and makes Pounds 324m cash call: Rights
issue at 400p to pay for agreed takeover of US soft drinks maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks company, yesterday
launched a Pounds 324m rights issue priced at 400p per share after reporting
a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 166.2m in the first half.
Most of the proceeds of the 1-for-9 issue are intended to fund a Dollars
334m (Pounds 217m) agreed takeover of A&amp;W Brands, the largest US producer of
root beer, also announced yesterday.
Acquisition of A&amp;W, which had sales last year of Dollars 130.8m, would raise
Cadbury's share of the US soft drinks market by almost two-thirds to 5.6 per
cent.
The proposed deal follows Cadbury's purchase last month of a further 20 per
cent of Dr Pepper, the third largest US soft drinks producer.
Cadbury said it was also negotiating the acquisition of an unnamed
confectionery business with sales last year of about Pounds 55m and net
tangible assets of Pounds 20m.
The rights issue, of 82.8m ordinary shares, is not conditional on completion
of the A&amp;W purchase. Hoare Govett is stockbroker to the issue, which has
been fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. Cadbury's shares closed
yesterday unchanged at 470p.
The latest pre-tax profits, for the six months to June 19, compare with
Pounds 125.9m last time and reflected strong improvements in all regions
except continental Europe. Sales increased 16 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn,
while group trading margin rose to 10 per cent from 9.6 per cent.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, described the performance as excellent. Though
continental markets remain depressed, he was confident that this year would
show 'significant progress'.
UK trading profit rose 29 per cent to Pounds 79m on particularly strong
performances by Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages and Trebor Bassett.
In continental Europe, a Pounds 15m loss in Spain due to restructuring costs
halved trading profit to Pounds 10m, though soft drinks performed better in
France. In the Americas, trading profit rose 56 per cent to Pounds 40m on
gains by beverages and the first full year contribution from Aguas Minerales
in Mexico. Pacific Rim trading profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 31.3m.
Results from Africa rose 39 per cent to Pounds 94.5m.
Earnings grew to 12.4p per share (from 10.26p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 3.6p from 3.3p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Babcock warns of loss after Drax problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Babcock Inter-national fell more than 20 per cent to 31 1/2 p last
night after the big UK engineering contractor said it would be unable to pay
an interim dividend and would report a loss for the six months ending
September 30.
Babcock blamed a Pounds 20m pre-tax provision to cover higher than expected
costs on its Pounds 400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) contract at
National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire, and closure costs
for Babcock Africa's non-core mining activities.
The expected first-half loss contrasts with pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.6m
a year ago, and underlines the risks involved in large project contracting.
The announcement was the first indication of problems on the Drax contract,
the world's largest FGD project for cleaning up the emissions from
coal-fired power stations, and producing commercial gypsum as a by-product.
Mr Jonathan Getz, analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said the news was 'a
really major disappointment'.
Mr Jeff Whalley, Babcock's acting chief executive, said the problems at Drax
stemmed from the costs involved in completing tests on the FGD units so far
installed. 'We brought more people in and took our eye off the cost line.'
In July a team from head office had found a Pounds 15m gap between expected
future income on the contract - due to be completed in 1996 - and costs, he
said.
Mr Whalley said the first two FGD units at Drax were due to go into
commercial operation in December, but Babcock would be able to build the
final four more efficiently. He said he had 'turned over every stone' at
Babcock in the past six months and was confident there would be no further
cost overruns at Drax or elsewhere.
Last year's interim dividend was 1p. Babcock said the amount of the dividend
for the current year ending next March would depend on trading results for
the year as a whole. Babcock also confirmed it was appointing Mr John Parker
as joint deputy chairman and chief executive, filling the gap created in
April when Mr Oliver Whitehead left after disagreeing with the board over
strategy.
Mr Parker resigned last week as chairman and chief executive of Harland &amp;
Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder. Babcock has also appointed Mr Nick Salmon,
an executive at the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom engineering group, as managing
director.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Liquidity seeps into US property: The search for higher
yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of stagnation, liquidity is seeping back into the US
commercial property market. The soaring prices - and falling yields - in
equity and bond markets are driving some investors into property in search
of higher returns. And with banks and insurance companies still weighed down
by their property lending binge of the late-1980s, there is a big overhang
of assets for sale.
On Wednesday, the Quantum Realty Fund, a property investment vehicle set up
by the financier George Soros, paid Dollars 634m (Pounds 419m) for a
portfolio of troubled property assets from Travelers, the US insurance
company. Even after the sale, Travelers has Dollars 4.3bn of underperforming
commercial mortgage loans and properties acquired through loan foreclosures.
Like other big insurers, including Prudential Insurance, it is still looking
at ways of unloading properties in bulk. Selling underperforming assets
allows the insurers to reinvest money in areas which offer a higher current
return.
Also, risk-based capital rules for insurers that are to come into force soon
will make property investments less attractive: Mr Bob Crispin, Travelers'
chief investment officer, estimates that property will attract a 10-15 per
cent capital charge, compared with the 1-2 per cent charge on corporate
bonds.
Travelers reports strong interest from pension funds looking to acquire
property assets. With pension funds increasing their involvement in
sub-investment grade bonds, emerging stock markets and Latin American debt,
it isn't surprising to see them returning to property as well. However, the
decline in property prices has undermined the view of property as a stable
asset offering a high rate of return.
Some investment managers, believing the stock and bond rallies are sure to
end soon, are building a bigger exposure to property: Morgan Stanley has
taken its investment in property from almost nothing to 9 per cent in less
than six months. The chance to earn yields of 8 per cent or more, when
10-year Treasury bond yields have fallen to 5.23 per cent, explains the
move.
One of the clearest indications of growing institutional interest has been
the flow of new cash into real estate investment trusts (Reits). In the
first six months, trusts raised Dollars 2.5bn, more than in the whole of
1992.
Demand for Reits pushed up the property investment trust index run by the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts by nearly 15 per cent
in the first three months of the year, though a correction in the second
quarter saw it fall back slightly. Even after this, the yield on property
investment trusts had fallen to around 6 per cent - well below that on
commercial properties traded in the private market.
Other securitisations of property have picked up. Total sales of new
commercial property-backed securities was running at around Dollars 1.5bn a
month in the first six months of this year, up from Dollars 1bn a month last
year.
The Resolution Trust Corporation, established to take on and dispose of
assets of troubled thrifts, accounted for only a quarter of these sales,
compared with more than a half during 1992. Its shrinking involvement has
left more room for private sector entities such as banks and insurers to
dispose of assets.
The yield premiums available on commercial mortgage-backed debt accounts for
much of the demand. A 10-year, double-A rated bond currently trades at a
yield of around 200 basis points (or two percentage points) above US
Treasuries. The yield premium on a comparable good-quality corporate bond is
only 70-80 basis points.
The demand is likely to generate more commercial property-backed securities.
The Quantum Fund plans to issue bonds to finance some Dollars 350m of its
Travelers purchase, and may also put some of the assets into a Reit, which
would then be floated. Prudential Insurance, which has hired Morgan Stanley
to explore the attractions of a bulk sale of as much as Dollars 700m of its
properties, is also considering shifting assets into a Reit.
In spite of the increased activity, there is little to suggest that property
values are heading up again. A commercial property market index run by
consultants Frank Russell and the NCREIF, based on appraised market values,
showed a total return of zero for the first six months of this year: the
income generated by properties in the index was wiped out by further capital
write-downs. This was at least an improvement after eight consecutive
quarters in which the total return had been negative.
Prices are likely to recover only when demand for vacant office, retail and
industrial space falls and rental income picks up. That will happen when
economic activity accelerates and companies take on more space to house
growing workforces. Yet last week's disappointing US employment data for
August offered little hope that America is returning to work yet.

FT  10 SEP 93 / BTR shares dip despite improved results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in BTR lost 17 1/2 p to 381 1/2 p yesterday after the UK industrial
conglomerate expressed caution about the strength of its markets in the
second half.
The shares fell even though BTR announced a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, a disposal worth up to Pounds 165m and an enhanced scrip dividend.
Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'Despite the pronouncements of
governments and economic forecasters, the outlook remains uncertain for any
economic recovery in the second half.'
BTR said evidence that the UK recovery was translating into significant
increases in profitability was still inconclusive. The recovery in the US,
so marked in the last quarter of 1992, had not maintained the same momentum
in the first half of this year, although a number of group companies had
improved their performance.
Some of BTR's businesses had been severely affected by the rapid
deterioration of the major European economies in the first half -
particularly those serving the German automotive industry. Even with the
loosening of the exchange rate mechanism, recession on the Continent would
remain a sensitivity into 1994.
BTR's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 548m to Pounds 602m in the six months
to June 30. Sales were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 4.87bn. Gearing is down
from 79 to 61 per cent.
The group said the results demonstrated its ability to prosper in
unfavourable trading conditions. Robust performance from other parts of the
world had helped compensate for difficulties in Europe. Profits continued to
improve from Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group BTR bought for Pounds
1.55bn at the end of 1991.
The group has agreed to sell Newey &amp; Eyre Group, a Birmingham-based
electrical distribution group, for up to Pounds 165m to Hagemeyer, a
Dutch-based international trading house. Newey &amp; Eyre, which has 200
branches and 2,800 employees in the UK and Ireland, had sales of Pounds 355m
in 1992 and net assets of Pounds 50m. Initial payment will be Pounds 110m,
with provision for up to Pounds 55m more, depending on performance targets
in 1994 and 1995.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 4 per cent to 10.5p (from 10.1p).
The declared interim dividend was increased 6.5 per cent to 4.95p (from
4.65p). BTR is offering an enhanced scrip alternative worth 7.425p, a 50 per
cent enhancement. BZW will pay a minimum cash alternative of 7.2765p.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Clarke pledges review of funding for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, last night announced a review of the role
of financial institutions in funding industry, in particular small
businesses.
The review, to be carried out by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to
the Treasury, will focus on whether business has access to the funds it
needs.
The chancellor told the annual dinner of the Confederation of British
Industry in Glasgow that he was concerned to ensure that the City and other
financial institutions contributed fully to the development of commerce and
industry.
The review is the first fruit of Mr Clarke's speech at the Mansion House in
June, in which he committed the Treasury to listen more to the concerns of
business. It also reflects the government's desire to ensure that the needs
of industry are at the forefront of policy-making.
The chancellor also announced measures to push forward the government's
private finance initiative, launched last year to attract private capital
for public-sector projects. A task force representing the public and private
sectors is to be formed to identify suitable projects and willing investors.
The initiative has attracted criticism for the lack of progress since it was
announced in the Autumn Statement. Many companies are reluctant to commit
resources to devising schemes to build new infrastructure, since they might
not win a contract when it goes out to tender.
Mr Nelson's review of funding for industry will aim to identify 'whether
there are any market imperfections which may distort the flows of finance',
according to the chancellor.
Among the issues to be reviewed will be the reliance of small and
medium-sized companies on bank overdrafts, which provide less flexibility
than types of finance available to businesses in other European countries.
Mr Nelson will also listen to complaints of 'short-termism' among
institutional investors, which refuse to adopt a long-term perspective in
funding growing businesses.
He will be keen to establish whether the market is failing to provide
finance to businesses with good investment potential.
The economic secretary is not expected to produce a report, the Treasury
said last night. However, it said that if problems are identified, the
government will take action to rectify them.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Mercedes seeks site in Europe to produce new small car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury carmaker, is considering four sites in
Europe for the construction of a new assembly plant.
The new plant, for which the UK is in the running, would produce the
company's planned small car, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief
executive, said yesterday.
A decision on the plant, which would be able to produce about 200,000 cars a
year, could be taken by the end of this year, he said. The company was
aiming for a share of about 2.5 per cent of the world market for small cars,
which totals about 8.5m.
Mercedes-Benz is seeking to spread manufacturing of its passenger vehicles
outside Germany as part of its new product strategy, although a German site
for the new plant is on the shortlist of four, which includes the UK and the
Czech Republic.
The disclosure will trigger intense competition between countries trying to
attract one of the biggest greenfield site automotive projects likely to be
built in Europe in the second half of the 1990s.
In recent years, the main share of new car assembly capacity in Europe has
been built in the UK with the development of three plants by Nissan, Toyota
and Honda, the Japanese carmakers.
The European car industry is already suffering heavily from over-capacity,
but Mercedes-Benz has been forced to plan a new facility to enter the small
car market. Mr Werner said the plant would be dedicated to the small car.
The decision to build a small car marks a sharp change of policy by the
German luxury carmaker, which is also planning to expand into other new
market segments, those for four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles and
multipurpose vehicles.
Mr Werner said an announcement would be made around the end of this month on
a location in the US for a plant to build the proposed four-wheel drive
leisure utility vehicle.
Mercedes-Benz planned to build up to 65,000 vehicles a year in this range
for sale worldwide, but expected the plant to break even at production of
less than 40,000 a year. The new MPV would be built at Mercedes-Benz's
existing plant in Spain and would be launched in January 1995, Mr Werner
said.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Press complaints body plans to resign if ombudsman appointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD McGregor and the other members of the Press Complaints Commission plan
to resign en masse if the government imposes an ombudsman to deal with
complaints against newspapers.
The government is pushing ahead with proposals for an ombudsman with the
power to award compensation to victims of press intrusion.
Proposals are also well advanced to create new criminal offences covering
electronic eavesdropping and taking pictures on private property, with
tightly constrained public-interest defences. The Lord Chancellor's Office
has also proposed a new law giving citizens the right to sue for up to
Pounds 10,000 in damages for invasion of privacy.
The stage now looks set for a bitter confrontation between press and
government. Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Council's replacement, has
said he will resign on the day an ombudsman is appointed, as self-regulation
of the press would be fatally weakened. His fellow commission members take a
similar view.
There has been considerable confusion and disagreement in the government on
press regulation in the wake of complaints about intrusion into the lives of
politicians and the royal family.
A white paper due from the Department of National Heritage before the summer
parliamentary recess failed to appear.
One of those involved said: 'We are waiting for a majority view to emerge.'
A consensus seems to be forming around the idea of the 'voluntary' ombudsman
who would hear appeals from those dissatisfied with commission verdicts. The
commission is paid for by the newspaper industry but now has a majority of
independent members.
The newspaper industry has said it will neither accept nor pay for such an
ombudsman.
Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the Newspaper Society, the body
representing local and regional newspapers, said: 'It is an utterly, utterly
absurd idea. It will be opposed by every newspaper in the country.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Bundesbank has acquired a reputation for only cutting interest
rates when the market does not expect it, yesterday's cut should perhaps
have been expected after all. The background has barely changed since its
last meeting, so yesterday's move appears basically technical. It has
restored a more normal relationship between money market rates and the
discount rate, which in turn gives Mr Hans Tietmeyer greater operational
flexibility during his first weeks in office as president.
The meagre 10 basis point cut in the repurchase rate must disappoint France.
Its dilemma over when and whether to move below German rates is all the more
awkward as its foreign exchange reserves remain negative.

FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Too big for the UK, too small for the world, Cadbury Schweppes has long
wondered how to acquire critical mass in overseas markets without
jeopardising its earnings record. Merging a series of small beverages
businesses appears a neat solution for the US. The ultimate prize would be
the creation of a cash generative franchise business controlling almost half
the non-cola market. Its realisation, however, is fraught with pitfalls.
Cadbury has first to secure A&amp;W Brands; it then has to persuade Dr Pepper to
sign up to the plan. A full bid for Dr Pepper has become a lot harder since
the latter swallowed its poison pill. The final fear would be that even if
Cadbury did make a splash in US beverages it would only provoke a scrap with
the two cola giants in their own backyard.
Cadbury must prove that the risks of creating a third force in the mature
and competitive US market are not so great as to detract from its other
virtues. The 9 per cent increase in its underlying earnings highlights its
considerable trading momentum. Its investments in China and Poland signpost
fruitful avenues of expansion available elsewhere in the world.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are real reasons for disappointment with BTR's first half results. The
operating margin has fallen; profit before interest would also be down
without the effect of exchange rate changes. But BTR's failure to deliver
strong organic growth only adds to the impression that it looks in need of
an acquisition again.
Unlike Williams, whose results also disappointed earlier this week, BTR's
balance sheet is increasingly able to support such a move. Gearing has
fallen by 8 percentage points since December. The disposal of Newey &amp; Eyre
and the enhanced scrip dividend will reduce it by about 12 points more. A
year from now the cash outlay on restructuring acquisitions could have
dwindled to a trickle.
Yet, if an acquisition looks both desirable and affordable, a suitable
target may be hard to find. At current market levels a contested bid for a
listed company could be prohibitively expensive. Shopping for an agreed
trade purchase might not yield anything large enough. The most interesting
opportunities could lie overseas. BTR's enhanced scrip dividend would make
greater sense if it reflected a realisation that an even larger proportion
of future earnings would be generated abroad.

FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely can a company with such an embarrassment of riches have faced such
uncertainty. In addition to price competition and government regulation,
Glaxo must cope with threats to Zantac, the ulcer drug which accounts for 44
per cent of sales. The legal challenge to Zantac's US patent now in progress
is the first hurdle. Generic and over-the-counter versions of Tagamet, the
rival ulcer drug, are not far behind. Although yesterday's generous dividend
increase marks an acknowledgment that the Pounds 1.8bn cash pile cannot grow
unchecked, Glaxo has good reasons for not handing back more by way of a
share buy-back.
Yet Glaxo's return on capital has fallen for each of the past six years as
cash has accumulated. That cannot be ignored indefinitely. So far the answer
has been to plough resources back into the business at an accelerating rate.
Planned research and development spending of Pounds 850m this year will be
double the level of 1990. The growth of Glaxo's new drugs suggests that past
investment is delivering an acceptable return. Whether the next wave will do
so - in the face of tougher regulation and competition - remains open to
doubt.
The cash issue will then have to be addressed again, especially if Zantac's
patent is secured. In the meantime a yield well above the market average
makes the risks more palatable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The habit of paying investors with non-existent money seems to be getting
out of hand. By passing a cash payout and going for an enhanced scrip
dividend, companies are trying to conserve cash as well as avoid advance
corporation tax. Perhaps the recent rush implies a fear that the wheeze will
be extinguished in the November budget. Yet an outright ban looks unlikely
since in the last budget the chancellor said he wanted to ease the problems
of companies with genuine ACT problems.
That said, the government's promised proposals on how to resolve ACT
difficulties are unlikely to provide a universal method of avoiding the tax.
Surplus ACT can arise because a company has very large overseas operations
and insufficient UK earnings to offset ACT payments. But those companies
which have seen UK earnings collapse, yet have maintained their dividends at
an unrealistically high level, also have the problem. A distinction between
the two seems valuable.
That division is increasingly seen in the market, where scrip dividends from
companies with overseas earnings problems can still get a reasonable
reception, but where those with high dividends, high gearing and negative
cash flow feel a certain chill. Investors should ask themselves about the
credibility of the implicit promise that comes with an enhanced scrip
dividend. The paper they are offered is only worth money if the company can
afford to service the increased equity base in future years. For those like
Ladbroke and T&amp;N with uncovered dividends and high gearing, that promise may
prove paper thin.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Plus ca change across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASUAL observer, returning tanned from a long news-free vacation, could
be forgiven for thinking that nothing has changed in Europe's tense and
turbulent foreign exchange markets. The Bundesbank continues to tease the
traders, yesterday delivering an unexpectedly large cut in official interest
rates. Meanwhile, much of the rest of Europe - France, Belgium and Denmark
in particular - continues to shadow the D-Mark and assume the punishingly
high real interest rates that Bundesbank policy implies.
But the world has changed. The collapse of the hard version of the exchange
rate mechanism in late July has removed the last remaining rationale for
these suicidal policies. Moreover, yesterday's rate cut, and the market
response to it, confirm that policy changes must come. First, domestic
conditions in Germany mean that monetary policy is not going to fall fast
enough to suit the rest of Europe's needs. Second, the rise of the D-Mark
against the dollar is tightening the economic squeeze across the rest of
Europe, and thus hastening the day when interest rates will have to fall
below those in Germany.
It may seem strange that the D-Mark should rally against the dollar in
response to a cut in official German rates. German three-month market rates
remain over three percentage points above rates in the US, while 10-year
yields are more than one point higher. But economic trends seem to imply
lower German rates and higher US yields. So why has the D-Mark risen by 6
3/4 per cent against the dollar since June?
Slow pace
The explanation is to be found in the economic news that has emerged over
the summer on both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundesbank has signalled
unambiguously that the slow pace of monetary policy easing will continue
throughout the autumn. Monetary growth remains above its target range and at
the top of the Bundesbank president-elect's list of concerns. Yesterday's
discount rate cut makes room for more easing. But the 'repo' rate was cut by
a mere tenth of one per cent, suggesting that this space will be exploited
slowly.
The headline German economic indicators send uncertain signals. Output rose
by half a per cent between the first and second quarters, while industrial
orders grew by 3 per cent in July. This growth was largely driven by
stockbuilding while German industry remains under severe pressure. But short
and long-term real interest rates are not punitively high, at least by
French standards.
Reduced forecasts
In the US, by contrast, the economic news has been bad. Output in the second
quarter grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent, slightly slower than in
Germany; employment fell again last month, and the Clinton administration
has reduced its forecasts of US economic growth to 2 per cent this year,
from 3.1 per cent as forecast in April. Of course, the US recovery will
eventually accelerate - short and long-term real rates are very low and
anecdotal evidence suggests that the housing market is beginning to lead a
pick-up in spending on consumer durables. But the next move on US short-term
interest rates could still be down.
This is why foreign investors have been happy to stay in Germany. Over the
next year the recent D-Mark rally may well unwind or worse; for the moment,
the currency is rising. What is perverse is the desire of much of the rest
of continental northern Europe to rise with it. In France, that means that
the key intervention rate has not fallen since July's crisis, that
short-term real interest rates remain in excess of 5 per cent, that output
is depressed and that unemployment is both very high and rising. In Belgium,
recent interest rate increases are deepening the fiscal crisis and weakening
the currency while not easing market fears.
Europe ought now to let the D-Mark gyrate alone. There is no fundamental
reason why the French franc ought either to follow the D-Mark down next year
or up over the coming months. The best thing for continental European
governments would be to acknowledge that the D-Mark's fluctuations reflect
German instability, to ignore Bundesbank council meetings and to set
interest rates according to domestic needs. The sooner they recognise that
the world has changed, the better.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Government a la Gore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIFFERENCE between Vice-President Al Gore's proposals for streamlining
the US federal government and the many similar plans advanced in previous
decades is largely one of motivation. The Clinton administration believes in
government: the purpose of this performance review was thus at least as much
to improve the public sector's effectiveness as it was to curb expenditure
by 'cutting it down to size'. As President Bill Clinton put it this week:
'Government is broken and we intend to fix it.'
The phrase 'reinventing government' is, however, misleading. Mr Gore's study
asked how government performs, not what it should do. There was no
discussion of larger questions, such as the appropriate role of government
in the 21st century or the proper distribution of responsibilities between
federal and lower levels.
The reforms proposed, moreover, are mostly tame. Mr Gore sets four main
priorities: cutting red tape, putting the customer first, empowering
employees by decentralising authority, and eliminating obsolete services. He
emphasises the importance of consumer choice and market forces. Agencies,
for example, will be encouraged to contract out services to the private
sector. He urges government to copy the latest management fads of US
companies. He says government must concentrate on achieving results rather
than setting rules and learn to 'steer, not row'. These fine sentiments
hardly amount to a redefinition of government. There is little here that has
not been tried in Britain and other countries.
Given the US's reputation for entrepreneurship, Mr Gore's charge of
'paralysing inefficiency' in the public sector may come as a surprise. But
there are good reasons why US government tends to be rule-bound and
inflexible.
Elaborate procedures
The calibre of its civil service is probably lower than in many European
countries, reflecting reliance on short-term political appointees, and the
greater relative attractions of private sector jobs. Rules for agencies are
highly complex - partly because of a long-running battle between the
executive and the legislature and partly because elaborate procedures have
been invented to prevent discrimination against minorities and reduce the
scope for corruption. The inability of officials to improvise or use
discretion partly reflects a justified fear of lawsuits. None of these
underlying causes of rigidity are properly addressed in Gore's report.
Obvious targets
It does, however, identify a number of obvious targets for reform. A century
after industry replaced farming as the principal economic activity, the
federal agriculture department still operates more than 12,000 field
offices, an average of nearly four per county, whether rural, urban or
suburban. Yet having emphasised the absurdity of this, the report proposes
closing only 10 per cent of them.
The administration claims that the 800 proposed reforms will save Dollars
108bn over five years and reduce the civilian federal workforce by about
252,000 (roughly 12 per cent). But few of the savings are spelt out in
detail. It is simply asserted, for instance, that more efficient procurement
will save Dollars 22bn over five years. The only merger or elimination of
departments envisaged - a partial transfer of powers from the Drug
Enforcement Agency to the FBI - is opposed by powerful members of the
cabinet. The ambitious staff cuts are to be achieved largely through natural
wastage and incentives for early retirement.
Previous attempts to reorganise federal government have gone nowhere. This
time there is a greater chance of progress. Mr Clinton is interested in the
topic of government reform in a way that Mr George Bush, for example, was
not. Polls suggest he badly needs to convince sceptical voters that the
public sector is competent to carry out his activist agenda. 'Reinventing
government' seems a perfect vehicle for establishing his credentials as a
centrist 'new Democrat' and neutralising the political appeal of Mr Ross
Perot. There is thus no doubt that Mr Clinton will make many rousing
speeches about the need to streamline the federal bureaucracy; but whether
he will have the time or energy to see that Congress acts on many of the
Gore proposals is far less certain.

FT  10 SEP 93 / How to stand out in a crowd: A marriage of technologies is
one way forward for poorly performing consumer electronics groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something profoundly wrong with Europe's electronics industry. Last
year, Thomson of France lost Dollars 300m in consumer electronics. Siemens
of Germany lost about Dollars 600m in personal computers and semiconductors.
Nokia of Finland lost Dollars 130m in consumer electronics. Philips of
Holland made a net loss of almost Dollars 500m overall. The industry, it
seems, has lost its way.
While the recession has not helped matters, the roots of the problem go
deeper. Take, as an example, television sets. Industry executives will tell
you that nobody has made money producing TVs in Europe for five or six
years. Even the mighty Matsushita of Japan, which supplies Europe with
Panasonic sets from a big new factory in Wales, has lost money in the UK
market for a decade.
It is natural enough that companies should make losses on new products while
they build up sales. But TV sets have now become a basic commodity, like
cornflakes. Cornflake manufacturers make handsome profits: why not TV
manufacturers?
Fortunately for electronics companies, parts of their industry can still be
highly profitable: in particular, telecommunications and defence, where
customers are mostly governments and markets are tightly restricted. But in
free markets even the best companies find it hard to make a living. In an
industry as vast and fast-growing as electronics, there should be room for
everyone. So why do companies keep handing out their products for less than
they cost to make?
Ten or even five years ago, European executives would have had a simple
answer: the Japanese, with their trade barriers, their cheap finance and
their obsession with market share. Now that the Japanese industry has
troubles of its own this excuse is heard less often. Other excuses must be
found.
Most of them are unpersuasive. In consumer electronics, executives say, the
problem is the power of the distributors. This seems absurd. The world's
biggest specialist electronics store chain is said to be Dixons of the UK.
By comparison with the world's food retailing giants, Dixons is a tadpole.
But the big food companies like Nestle or Unilever enjoy margins of which
electronics companies can only dream.
A more substantial argument has to do with the high cost of investment.
Professor Walter Kunerth, executive vice-president of Siemens, says: 'To set
up a new technology costs a lot of money. To justify that expense, you have
to build big capacity. Then you need volume to justify the capacity.'
And, as the production chief of a consumer electronics group says, this
makes it harder for companies to get out. 'The barrier to exit in this
game,' he says, 'is a high invested cost. If you're in it on a global basis,
the sunk cost is huge.' On the other hand, he points out, that same
investment entails a very high depreciation charge. So even if a company is
making losses after depreciation, it may well be generating cash. 'That's
why we all chase volume at the expense of profit,' he says.
The snag about this argument is that, by implication, it writes off whole
chunks of the industry as a giant commercial blunder. Companies are trapped
by their investment mistakes of the past, and are thus obliged to throw good
money after bad. While such things are not unknown elsewhere, it seems odd
that a sophisticated industry like electronics should produce managerial
incompetence on this scale.
There is a further argument to explain consumer electronics' demise which is
perhaps more credible. 'The industry has worn out its consumer appeal over
the past 10 years,' says the head of business development at a European
group. To appreciate his point, ask yourself what make of radio you have in
your kitchen, or what kind of TV in your front room. A surprising number of
people cannot remember. But they do know what kind of car they drive or what
brand of breakfast cereal they eat in the morning.
'Cars are an element of social distinction,' the executive says. 'A TV set
is not. You can take pride in having a lousy TV set, as a sign of having
better things to do with your time.'
The manufacturers are thus in a jam. If you are looking to buy a video
recorder or clock radio, you will tend to stick to a few names you know:
Sony, Philips, Panasonic and so on. The manufacturers spend heavily on
marketing to remain in that exclusive club. But the chances are you will
base your final choice on price, since in other respects there will be
little to choose between them.
Perhaps the fixation of consumers on price has a more basic cause. It is a
truism in electronics to say products cost less than they used to, and in
future will cost less again. This is mainly because of the industry's
phenomenal record on productivity. 'If Rolls-Royce had achieved the same
productivity gains as the TV industry,' says the business development chief,
'a Rolls would cost the same today as a bicycle.'
The snag for the companies is, of course, that the industry has given away
all of these productivity gains to the customer. Worse, it has created a
perpetually shifting environment in which the consumer cannot form an
impression of what constitutes fair value. This kind of slippery slope is
the nightmare of any consumer manufacturer or retailer; in creating it, the
industry is the victim of its own success.
As if all this were not enough, there is the looming shadow of Japan.
Historically, the low price environment worked in Japanese companies'
favour. This can be simply illustrated in financial terms by comparing two
giants of the world industry, Philips and Matsushita.
In 1982, Matsushita had sales of about Dollars 14bn, compared with Philips's
Dollars 16bn. Since then Mat-sushita has kept its prices and margins
relentlessly low, and its growth has been ferocious. By 1992 it had sales of
Dollars 61bn, against Philips's Dollars 32bn. In a decade, the Japanese
company went from being smaller than Philips to twice its size.
In the process, Matsushita built up formidable cash flow and balance sheet
strength. Compare the financial performance of the two companies in last
year's recessionary conditions. Philips's cash flow, net of capital
investment and dividends, was Dollars 166m. Matsushita produced a torrential
Dollars 1.9bn. Thus, while Philips's gearing ratio - net debt measured
against equity - rose from 148 per cent to 167 per cent, Matsushita's fell
from 42 per cent to 31 per cent.
If this sounds too one-sided to be true, there are signs it may be changing.
Japanese giants are under pressure on two fronts: their domestic market has
fallen sharply, and their shareholders are demanding more profits and
dividends to compensate for the share-price collapse over the past two
years.
In Europe, this results in the bizarre spectacle of Japanese companies
pleading for higher prices. Mr Katsuro Sakakibara, Matsushita's main board
director in charge of European operations, says: 'We have raised our selling
prices twice this year. Very few of our competitors raised theirs. We cannot
operate at a loss, and also we feel someone must sell at a reasonable price.
It is then my strong hope that other people will correct their attitude to
pricing. So far, nothing has hap-pened.'
'Beyond a certain level,' an executive of a European company says, 'the
price war doesn't make sense. I'm convinced the tougher economic environment
in Japan will make Japanese companies more reasonable in the long run. They
cannot expect to compensate huge price declines with huge volume increases,
as they did in the 1970s and 1980s. There are fewer companies left to kill,
and those that are left don't want to die.'
And, the executive points out, Far Eastern competitors no longer have the
access to cheap capital they used to have. 'The Japanese and Korean
companies used that capital to build up stocks,' he says. 'Nowadays, they
will find volume increases expensive to achieve.'
But if this takes pressure off European companies in the short term, no one
believes it solves the fundamental problem. It simply means the Japanese are
in the same boat as everyone else. So how is the industry to achieve its
salvation?
Dr Ron Sommer, head of Sony's operations in Europe, gives a clue. 'When you
think about competitors,' he says, 'you perhaps think about Philips, Thomson
and Matsushita. I don't. I think about the telephone companies and the
computer companies. Those markets are intermingling.'
The industry, he argues, will look different as a result. 'On the one hand,
there may not be so many companies. On the other, you will categorise them
differently. You will start to look at telecoms, computer and entertainment
companies in one block rather than clearly separating them. That doesn't
mean I see Sony in the 21st century producing a mainframe or putting a
telephone line from the US to Europe. I don't see IBM or AT&amp;T producing a
Walkman either. But there are plenty of new businesses where we will cross
over. Tomorrow, there may be a video dial tone to your home via the
telephone line. That must have something to do with Sony.'
A European rival agrees. 'In 10 or 15 years, personal communications,
computers and so forth will all be one world. That probably will mean
alliances. It's difficult to assess what kind: mammoth new companies, or
consortia of companies often in unrelated industries with ties of cross
ownership along the lines of the Japanese keiretsu model. It's impossible to
be clear. But it is clearly a world where levels of investment and barriers
to entry will rise.'
This process of rationalisation and co-operation is not confined to consumer
electronics. Siemens, as Professor Kunerth points out, has already formed an
alliance to develop the technology for the 256 M-Dram chip, the next
generation computer memory chip, with Toshiba and IBM. 'The development cost
alone runs into billions,' he says. 'Then you have to decide to set up a
factory. To get the pay-off on your R&amp;D the factory has to sell high
quantities, which can only be done worldwide. I don't know where the factory
will be, but there will be only one to supply the world market.'
All this, he argues, is the inexorable result of increased technological
sophistication. 'The higher the level of technology, the more the need for
capital, the fewer the players and the greater the need for a big market.
With a 256 M-Dram, you can do things with one component where you needed 10
or 20 before. So the total quantities go down, which puts more pressure
again on the number of players.'
In this process, the companies will start to look very different. To the
outsider, Professor Kunerth says, Siemens may seem a monolith. Below the
surface, various alliances are developing. 'Different companies within
Siemens have different kinds of co-operation with other companies. It can be
a marketing co-operation, or a development co-operation, or even a joint
venture, such as we have with Matsushita in passive components (commodity
devices). On the one hand, you have to concentrate on your core
competencies. On the other, you have to sell businesses, co-operate, go into
minority positions and so on.'
The result could be a series of loose federations, in fact, a new kind of
capitalism. 'The future structure of our industry will be much more
complex,' Prof Kunerth says. 'The same companies will compete in one field
and co-operate in another. This is only possible if you have mutual trust
and common business ethics. If you have been hitting someone on the head for
years, co-operation is very difficult.'
This, then, is the vision of the future: a world in which the mingling of
technologies and the rising burden of investment mean there are only two or
three dominant players in a given area. The fewer the competitors, the less
the competition and the higher the profits.
There is one big risk. The industry got itself into this mess in the first
place by pumping out volume to justify past investment. It is now talking
about still greater investment, requiring still greater volumes. What is the
guarantee that in the brave new world, the old suicidal competition will not
con-tinue?
'I can't say,' Prof Kunerth says simply. 'But it's the only way. If you
don't do it this way, you're certain to lose money. You won't survive.'

Ingenuity was sorely tested when anti-Maastricht treaty campaigners this
week began preparing the effigy of foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, which
swung from gallows in Hexham, Northumberland, yesterday to mark the laying
of treason charges against him.
'We tried all the joke shops to get a mask of Douglas Hurd but we couldn't
find one anywhere; they only had John Major,' says David Moon, one of the
Essex anti-federalists involved in the body-building. In the end they had to
compromise and stuck a photograph of Hurd on to the head of a dummy.
Meanwhile, making the gallows proved a bit more tricky. But necessity
facilitated invention and, quips Cheltenham-based Melvyn Rendell: 'We've got
the blueprint. We'd be happy to go on Blue Peter.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We know the British Broadcasting Corporation is watching its pennies - who
isn't? - but the paucity of some of its prizes is no deterrent to Russian
listeners.
The BBC's external services recently ran a competition which invited
Russians to speculate on the likely rouble-US dollar exchange rate for
midsummer.
Prizes were two copies (in Russian) of Paul Samuelson's standard economics
text book - bane of many a western undergraduate's life - plus a handful of
electronic calculators and BBC pens.
The competition attracted 1,389 replies, some from far-flung regions. But
the response from one Russian schoolgirl reveals that a certain western
cynicism about economic theory has begun to filter through; she asked for a
BBC T-shirt instead of the Samuelson.

Could it be that Glasgow's Forte Crest hotel has an ex-actor for its

say it decided temporarily to rename the Lamont Suite as the Scottish Suite,
during Kenneth Clarke's sojourn last night after his address to the annual

But it was clearly a joke; the duty manager at the hotel said Clarke stayed
in the Buchanan Suite and that there were no plans to rename the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poles are beginning to feel a little edgy about who, constitutionally,
controls their secret police service, known as the UOP.
The circumstances surrounding the dismissal last Friday of Adam Hodysz, the
chief of Gdansk's secret police unit and one of Solidarity's heroes, have
now been taken up by Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. She plans to start an
official inquiry into the affair.
Hodysz, 53, was the Gdansk dissident movement's mole in the local secret
police headquarters from 1978 till his arrest in 1984, when he served a
four-year prison sentence for his pains.
Hodysz is also acclaimed for having warned Solidarity's leadership about the
imminent imposition of martial law in December 1981.
In the post-communist era Hodysz was reinstated, his moral credibility as
high as that of anyone in Poland. He was appointed chief of the UOP in
Gdansk in early 1990.
What has got the gossips going is that Hodysz's replacement is Henryk
Zabicki, another secret policeman who first caught Lech Walesa's eye in
1985, while in charge of watching the future president. Zabicki has more
recently managed the security guards protecting the president's children in
Gdansk.
Constitutionally, the hiring and firing of security officials lies with the
government, not the presidency. But some observers detect the presidential
hand in the otherwise puzzling demotion of Hodysz.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Observer: Pissaloux passe?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques de Larosiere has just made his first visit to the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development since becoming president-elect of the bank.
In a speech to directors and vice-presidents, he hinted at changes that
pleased almost everyone.
Moreover, with a political deftness learned at the Bank of France and the
IMF, he took considerable care not to make any binding commitments.
The directors were delighted when he promised to consult them on strategic
issues rather more than had his predecessor, Jacques Attali.
However, one executive who might be feeling vulnerable following de
Larosiere's speech is Pierre Pissaloux.
Pissaloux was in charge of the inordinately expensive project to fit out the
bank's London headquarters.
Originally, he had two grand titles at the bank. At the start he was both
budget director and director of the president's cabinet; but following the
news of the bank's high-spending on its refurbishments, Pissaloux
relinquished the budget job.
Now his remaining responsibilities would seem to be under a sword of
Damocles - de Larosiere has apparently informed the EBRD's directors that he
sees no need for a presidential cabinet.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Government view on contract indemnity
clauses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY BALDRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The headline in your report, 'Government backs down on tendering'
(September 7), may have given a misleading interpretation of the
government's view on indemnity clauses in tendering contracts. The report
related to the action of South Lakelend District Council, which had required
tenderers for a compulsory competitive tendering contract to provide an
indemnity against the contingency of the contract, if entered into in the
belief that no transfer of undertaking was involved being at some later
dated ruled to be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations.
In such an event, the government's view is there would not normally be any
question of financial liability on the transferor authority. It takes the
view that local authorities do not normally have any cause to require
tenderers to provide indemnities, and any such requirements are liable to be
anti-competitive and in breach of CCT legislation.
In the South Lakeland case, the department took the view that it was not
appropriate to take statutory action against the council; we believed that -
notwithstanding the council's unjustified action in asking for indemnities -
there had in this case been a reasonable competitive response.
But in notifying South Lakeland of its decision, the department emphasised
the principle that indemnities were not normally appropriate, and clearly
spelt out that 'where an authority seeks to incorporate an indemnity clause
in (CCT) contract documentation, the secretary of state may decide to take
statutory action'.
Compulsory competitive tendering has given local residents and taxpayers
better services and lower costs. The government will continue to deal firmly
with authorities which seek to restrict competition with unreasonable
contract conditions or any other kind of anti-competitive action.

environment minister,

<TEXT>
Be daring. Assume that Mr John Major survives as prime minister. Go on. It
is a fair assumption. Put the odds at about 50-50 against, which is more
favourable to the incumbent than his behaviour this week might suggest.
Whatever his intentions, Mr Major has given the impression that he is
running scared. What other interpretation can be placed on the actions of a
politician who celebrates the return of the busy season by popping up among
regional party officials here and there, seeking to 'restore morale'? The
ordinary observer must assume that he is trying to save his job. It could
have the opposite effect. The Liberal Democrats, which have been identified
as the principal threat to the Conservatives in the south-west, will
doubtless benefit from the attention thus focused upon them.
The prime minister invariably wins friends and admirers when he appears
before small groups in person, but there is a physical limit to the number
of people he can reach in that manner. There is no way around it. Mr Major
will stand or fall by what he does in Number 10 Downing Street, by how he
minds the shop. He needs a string of successes, or at least a period free of
political disasters.
His chances of such a happy outcome are, as I say, a hair's breadth less
than evens. The government still looks disunited, partly as a result of the
cheeky public statements of a few cabinet ministers, Mr John Redwood
prominent among them, and partly in consequence of the willingness of
right-wing MPs to rush to the microphones and proclaim their aversion to
this or that tax increase should it be brought forward in the November
Budget. In reality nothing has changed since Mr Kenneth Clarke became
chancellor in the late spring and immediately intimated, as I recorded at
the time, that he saw little room for further spending cuts and could not
rule out tax increases. He said as much in public before the summer
holidays, and again this week.
If anyone can traverse the budgetary minefield and live to tell the tale, it
is Mr Clarke. This may be less difficult than it seems. The chancellor and
the prime minister are both aware that a vote against a finance bill is a
vote of no confidence that could bring the government down and put Labour
in. Few of the posturing rebels would risk that. It is therefore reasonable
to postulate that Mr Major may see an end to his period of lame-duckery.
If so, he may derive satisfaction from the promotion of a series of small
improvements to everyday life. The schemes to bring about 'open government',
the citizen's charters, and the plans for deregulation are all close to his
heart. None of these, taken separately or regarded as a bundle, will make
heroic headlines. All of them reflect the character of the prime minister.
Details fascinate him. Small incremental improvements are his stock in
trade.
With some passion, he has inscribed the word 'deregulation' on his banner.
Expect many minnows, but no whales. A 1985 white paper, Lifting the Burden,
trumpeted the forthcoming removal of red tape. Silence followed. It was
disturbed only by the soft flap of pages of new regulations as they
accumulated on lawyers' shelves. When Mr Major entered Number 10 he found a
'deregulation advisory panel' with an address somewhere in Whitehall. It has
been lost again, but may still exist. His undertaking at last year's
Conservative party conference to send Mr Michael Heseltine swooping through
the regulatory jungle has been followed up, in spite of Tarzan's illness, by
the appointment of eight 'taskforces', most of them headed by businessmen.
Departments have dutifully presented lists of good intent. The taskforce
reports must be in by October, to support a deregulation bill to put before
the new parliament in November. The government is not open enough to
indicate whether this will specify laws that must be amended or scrapped or
whether, as some propose, it will be a 'Henry VIII' bill - the type that
says, in effect, that a given minister (Mr Heseltine?) may do as he pleases
and let the House of Commons know when it is done. Many existing regulations
can anyway be withdrawn or changed in the same manner as they were imposed:
by ministerial fiat. So can departmental procedures, circulars and advisory
notes.
Rest assured. Something will come of it. How much? As little as civil
servants and ministers think must be sacrificed in order to get the prime
minister off their backs. It was the same with open government and the
charters. Improvements will unquestionably result. I have seen some myself,
as with the charter's effect on social security office turnround times. But
officials and ministers retain control over important information, internal
working practices and the power to regulate. Mr Major might revolutionise
the culture of Whitehall if he had a decade in office, but that length of
tenure is no longer certain.
It is not only civil service cunning that is in the way of radical reform.
Most regulations are there for a reason. Entrepreneurs, instinctive
anarchists to a man or woman, naturally cheer when the government promises
to tear up thousands of rules - unless the ones that are scrapped protect
them or their immediate interests. You may rejoice at the news that care
homes, in some of which some FT readers have invested substantial amounts,
may be freed from the costly attentions of pettifogging inspectors. You
would react quite differently if you heard that elderly residents, confused
and helpless, had fallen victim to unscrupulous managements of laxly
regulated establishments. This week's hullabaloo over the possible
relaxation of the rules governing the registration and inspection of private
residential and nursing homes is a perfect illustration of the deregulators'
dilemma.
Last month a report prepared under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Levene
recommended the creation of a regulatory review commission. The government
rejected it. You can see its disadvantages. It might conduct business in the
open. Citizens might have access to its workings. And it might take control
of deregulation away from the permanent secretaries. It would be almost as
bad as a freedom of information act. The mandarins' defensive strategy,
which is to give little while seeming to give a great deal, would be blown.
They need have no fears. At least for now. Whitehall is safe in Mr Major's
hands.
