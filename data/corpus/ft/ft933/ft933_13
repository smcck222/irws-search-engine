FT  10 SEP 93 / A long and winding road: Democratic niceties will have to
wait in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African politicians were quick to tell their followers that Tuesday's
decision to establish a limited multiracial interim government was a
significant step on the road to democracy.
They forgot to mention a fact that has become increasingly clear in recent
weeks: that the two leading negotiating parties, the African National
Congress and the National party, foresee no straight path to democracy.
Leading figures in both parties envisage a wide detour into illiberal
territory almost immediately after the first multiracial elections next
year. They seem likely to impose a tough security crackdown as one of the
first acts of a power-sharing government of national unity: and in a society
obsessed by fear of widespread violence, most voters would probably thank
them for doing so. Indeed, Wednesday's massacre of about 30 blacks at taxi
ranks near Johannesburg - which came barely 24 hours after Tuesday's deal -
can only strengthen the hand of those who favour tough measures.
At least in the short term, South Africans are likely to be voting on April
27 next year to swap one form of authoritarian government for another: more
broadly based, more legitimate, certainly more effective - but no more
saintly than the current incumbents. The democratic niceties will have to
wait upon the overwhelming need to restore stability.
Baffled by the complexities of the constitutional negotiations, and confused
by the intricate deals aimed at cementing the power sharing, most South
Africans spend their time worrying about personal security - not democracy.
Little can be done before the elections to stem the violence that has left
10,000 blacks (and scores of white farmers, diners and churchgoers) dead in
political violence since Mr Nelson Mandela left prison in 1990. Indeed, as
political competition intensifies ahead of the elections - which the mainly
Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and ultra-right Conservative party plan to
boycott - the death toll can only rise.
The consensus emerging among the ANC and the NP is to forge ahead to
elections, however unfree and unfair, on the principle that no delay will
make them freer or fairer. Neither side dares risk a postponement, unless
relatively minor.
So South Africa hurtles headlong towards elections, less than eight months
away, without a constitution under which to hold the poll. There is no
agreement on any of the crucial issues: of how power is to be shared between
the centre and the regions, or between the ANC and the National party; of
how the increasingly obstructive Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha
Freedom party can be satisfied; or of how the threat of Afrikaner
nationalism can be defused.
Even the Transitional Executive Council - that tentative first step to
democracy - cannot be set up until a constitution is agreed. And agreement
on the TEC itself was only reached after delegates de-cided to move out of
their hotel rooms and cancel subsequent negotiating sessions, to leave no
alternative but agreement before bedtime.
Multi-party talks will now focus on the first post-apartheid constitution,
which has already gone through many permutations. Delegates believe it will
be agreed by the end of October, but there is a significant chance of delay,
dangerously jeopardising the election date.
Two significant issues will determine when agreement is reached, and whether
the constitution has broad enough legitimacy to prevent civil war: the
distribution of power between central government and regions, and the role
of the National party in cabinet.
The current constitutional draft offers little in the way of devolution of
power to regions: regional governments would have exclusive powers over only
relatively minor areas such as gambling, traffic, language, culture and
markets. Chief Buthelezi and other homeland (or regional) leaders
contemptuously dismiss what they see as an offer to issue their own dog
licences, and demand exclusive control over regional policing and other
controversial areas. Government officials hope that both Chief Buthelezi and
the Afrikaner Volksfront (an umbrella right-wing group which has gained
strong white support in recent weeks) can be accommodated by giving some
regions more powers than others.
But it is anybody's guess whether Chief Buthelezi will settle for autonomous
local policing and perhaps a home guard for his regional base Natal - or
even whether the ANC will offer it. The latter pays lip service to the need
to accommodate the Zulu chief; but his increasingly aggressive behaviour
raises questions over whether he is genuinely seeking a deal.
Pretoria and foreign governments alike are exasperated with his threats of
civil war, and his refusal to compromise. Over the next few weeks, the
government must negotiate with the ANC to make an offer Chief Buthelezi
cannot refuse - and hope that he sees fit to accept it.
Equally difficult will be the task of persuading the Afrikaner Volksfront of
retired General Constand Viljoen that Afrikaner autonomy can be gained
without violence. So long as Gen Viljoen insists that blacks cannot be full
citizens in an Afrikaner region, there will be no deal; but if he leaves the
current round of talks without a deal on autonomy, his constituency may look
to more militant leaders.
If neither Inkatha nor the white right can be brought on board, even the
toughest crackdown could be insufficient to restore law and order -
especially if the Zulus and the Afrikaners strengthen their current tactical
alliance, and opt for violent resistance.
That leaves the question of the National party's role in the first
post-apartheid government. The ANC has already agreed that it will share
power with its former oppressors; but debate continues over how to ensure
that whites (through the National party) have what amounts to a veto over
important cabinet decisions.
This could be done by making Mr FW de Klerk the vice-president under Mr
Mandela, and giving him veto powers over, for example, the budget and
national security. Government sources appear willing to accept such a veto
might be necessary only for the first two years of the five-year government
of national unity; after that, a three-quarters or even two-thirds vote in
cabinet might suffice. And, significantly, it seems unlikely that there will
be any constitutional provision for power-sharing after the initial
five-year period: the National party will hope to make itself indispensable
to the ANC in that period - but not to force it to share power beyond 1999.
Somehow, the ANC and government must make a deal on this issue; for they
must work together if South Africa is to have any hope of stability - not to
mention the chance to give true democracy a try.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Markets do not destroy values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T CHRISTOPHER MCCOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Once again the market has come under attack for promoting the
destruction of values that are the bedrock of social institutions. The
dynamic within Lord Lawson's recent speeches may be 'yesterday's battle' to
Mr Cleaver (Letters, September 8), but I must disagree.
Mr Cleaver points to an array of the market's effects upon the social
system, expressly focused on the ills of freedom. The result, he says, is
the disincentive for long-term relationships and, in the end, broken or
non-existent families. If one accepts Mr Cleaver's arguments wholesale, then
maybe the answer should be an endeavour to create a 'valued' economic system
which would dovetail with the accepted boundaries of social and moral
spheres. Those spheres would presumably include a strong family centre
around which their members' lives could find meaning and comfort.
A daunting task indeed. Socialism was an outcrop of such general notions. It
had its roots in the idea that the failures of a laisser faire market could
be corrected by constricting it with specific social ends. It progressed, if
that is the proper term, to forsake the market altogether and the results
are plain to see.
I wonder how far the well-being (however one might define that expression)
of Mr Cleaver's family would degenerate after 70-plus years if we heed his
warning by limiting those freedoms and ignore the more familiar remarks of
Lord Lawson?

FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Real world of stock valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MCNAUGHT-DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Jackson, in his interesting article, 'Peril of losing touch with
the real world' (August 13), concerning the fact that stock market
valuations reflect economic expectations implicit in all the available
economic and political data rather than current industrial performance,
makes a fundamental error and is guilty of an important oversight.
He declares, incorrectly, that dividends are paid from profits when they are
clearly a cash cost of running a business and as such are paid out of cash
flows.
It is true that it is unusual that dividends exceed post-tax profits. It is
by no means unheard of, though, in an age when institutions such as M&amp;G
would prefer dividends to be paid even if a rights issue is required to
repair the damage to the balance sheet from the cash outflow.
He rightly notes, however, that the price/earnings ratio is 'one of the
simplest methods of (share) valuation'. Indeed, in the US more attention is
paid to the ratio of share price to cash flow, even if EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is merely a proxy for
the latter and thereby omits the cash-flow implications of capital
expenditure and changes in working capital.
His oversight lies in his failure to discuss the importance of the increased
supply of capital to the stock market from investors, thereby boosting share
prices and their multiples, when they find the yields available from cash
and bonds relatively unattractive.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Steamrolling corporate Names plan is
not justified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Lapper ('Lure of profits tempts corporate Names', September 8)
is quite right to sound a note of caution about existing Names' approval of
Lloyd's rules for corporate Names.
The action groups, which are well organised and command more than half the
voting membership of Lloyd's, do not believe that the need for corporate
capital in 1994 is sufficiently acute to justify steamrolling the new
proposals in advance of evidence that Lloyd's will be producing an
acceptable settlement of Names' present claims for negligence and breach of
contract.
Although the admission of corporate capital must be regarded as a sensible
long-term measure, it must be at the right time and in the right way. Unless
assurances are forthcoming, the membership may well decide to vote down the
council's proposals at the EGM on October 20.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Union members remain committed to
collective bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ALEXANDRA OUROUSSOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart, in his article 'On the lookout for the vision thing'
(September 6), reports that collective bargaining between employers and
trade unions is declining. I detect (from my own research with trade union
members) an ideological bias in the analysis he offers of this important
development.
Goodhart interpets this trend as 'the tailoring of union activities to
individuals', citing a 1992 survey by the National Union of Public Employees
in which respondents put 'advice on disciplinary issues and grievances'
ahead of collective wage bargaining in a list of their reasons for joining a
trade union.
From this he argues a need for trade unions to concentrate on providing
services to individual members, if they are to survive. This, he says, is in
accordance with the members' wishes.
I agree that this kind of service is increasingly valued by trade unionists.
Goodhart, however, overlooks the real reason for the response by Nupe's
members. My own work with other unions suggests that it is the dramatic
increase in workplace intimidation by employers and managers in the past
decade that has brought the issues of discipline and grievance settlement to
the forefront of unionists' minds.
I have seen no evidence that employees are losing interest in collective
bargaining over wages, especially in these difficult economic times, only
that they now want stronger representation in disciplinary and other
workplace issues added to the unions' traditional role in defending wages -
which are, after all, the reason why they go to work.
Goodhart seems to interpret the Nupe survey as confirming a supposed trend
towards an increasingly individualist society. But surely it is the
collective strength of the trade union movement that leads employees to take
their disciplin-ary and other grievances to their unions in the first place.
We should beware of undisputed fact being used to support dubious,
politically inspired myth.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: A Brutus of the billiard-table business - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINE new play at the Hampstead Theatre is about a father wilfully
underating his sons and his sons wanting to hurt their father. It is so
well-written that it can steer its audience from a zipping, uproariously
funny start, through a mid-ground where laughter is both appropriate and
inappropriate, to the gradual, serious contemplation of a moral dilemma. All
about a small family business with three generations, it stirs up the raw
feelings that can only occur within a family.
Jack and Gordon, two surviving sons of Mr Chapel, have been preparing for 20
years to push their father, now 75, into retirement. The third generation,
Barry, David, and Tony, are in their 20s, and can already see that the
company needs changes more radical than those Jack and Gordon would
initiate. Chapel, meanwhile, is not going lightly. Father/son conflicts
ignite all over the place. A Going Concern catches all the chatty comedy
pertinent to men sharing a workroom, and it picks up that brisk comic tone
at several points.
The family company makes, and repairs, billiard tables. The play's author is
Stephen Jeffreys, who recently adapted the RSC's staging of A Jovial Crew
and whose own comedy Valued Friends was a success at the Hampstead Theatre
in 1989 and 1990. A Going Concern is based on autobiographical material for
him.
Matthew Lloyd directs; and I have only praise for his cast, and for the way
the play introduces them as simple sit-com types and then deepens them, one
by one. Reece Dinsdale is Tony, who emerges as the young Brutus of this
family coup d'etat; David Killick is his fierce father Gordon; David
Horovich is Gordon's milder brother Jack; James Clyde their nephew Barry,
devoted to 1960s pop music; Adam Godley is Jack's son David, an Eng. lit.
student who occasionally works for the company (plainly closest to Jeffreys
himself); Henry Stamper is the heartless old fox Chapel.
Each one is a vivid agent in the drama; and each then stands back to comment
in alarm on what occurs. (This even goes for the non-family member of the
workforce, Ray, played by Shaun Prendergast.) Samantha Holland is Vicky, the
new accountant who finds herself suddenly involved with the business
officially and in private. It is she who has the play's best line ('Right
now, there is one sixth of a melon dusted with cinnamon sitting in a fridge
in Muswell Hill with your name on it') - funny because of both its timing
and her deadpan delivery; and it is she who exposes the family's most
serious secret treacheries.
The play shines with old-fashioned virtues. Every role is interestingly
three-dimensional; the fluctuation of comic and serious tone is perfectly
judged; there is even a quotation ('days of wine and roses'), skilfully
introduced and woven through the play. I am not sure, however, why he sets
it in 1966 and makes it a period piece (references to Donovan, The Man from
UNCLE, et al). Just as the play's rawer surfaces grow exciting, some new
period detail distances it from us. And several long speeches are conceived
slightly too much as great set pieces. The play stirs me, but I occasionally
wish it were less neat.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: An African Macbeth - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Mortimer's father used to greet his three-year-old son with 'Is
execution done on Cawdor?', expecting a reply from the fledgling
barrister-writer. The beauty of this is that the entire play flashes in
front of you: the blood, the dark, the assassinations, the multitudinous
seas. Macbeth translates well from one place to another. At the Bridge Lane
Theatre, clannish Scotland has become tribal Africa, maybe Nigeria or Ghana.
This is a predominantly black African Macbeth from Committed Artists UK, a
British company which has just finished a tour of the US. The production has
moments of great power, but could still quicken and concentrate.
The set is a large sandy pancake with oil drums round one side and a smoking
pot of incense in the middle. The modern design puts the soldiers in red
berets and fatigues; the weapons of choice, a problem when bringing
Shakespeare into the era of automatic fire, are machetes.
At the opening, the witches curse and spit in the sand, like the exemplary
weird sisters in Roman Polanski's violent film version. This is voodoo
rather than Celtic sorcery, and the witches are an unsettling presence
appearing throughout the action behind a mesh screen at the wall behind the
circular stage. Later, the witches work themselves into a fine frenzy,
dispelling the thought that 'double double toil and trouble' might have more
to do with backgammon than the clairvoyant cassoulet ('eye of newt . . .
tongue of dog') they are cooking for Macbeth.
Stephen Rayne's direction of this, Shakespeare's shortest play, strings the
action out; the acting, especially in the court scenes, is fitful and
patchy. Macbeth (Hakeem Kae-Kazeem) starts out matter-of-factly, a
trigger-happy guerrilla. But with 'If it were done, when 'tis done' the
issues become lucid, even if elsewhere the verse sounds choppy. The
Banquo-ghost scenes are a stormy triumph, but Macbeth finishes too quietly,
wrapped in a cloak, rocking on his haunches over the body of his wife,
clutching a voodoo doll as the witches look on.
The play's energies gather at the entrance of Lady Macbeth, superbly played
by Jaye Griffiths. From her first lines she finds the urgency and
breathiness in the part. She reacts physically as she summons the spirits to
'unsex' her and fill her with cruelty.
The production draws on Trevor Nunn's chamber style of Shakespeare from the
Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. It shows Bridge Lane at its best; this is
a fine space, an Almeida south of the river, just surviving into its 11th
year in a harsh financial climate.
In repertory, Bridge Lane Theatre, SW11 (071-228-8828).

FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: OUT goes Michelangelo, IN comes the glib idea -
William Packer plumbs the Arts Council's strange philosophy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS eager, condescending way, the pamphlet for children that accompanies
the Arts Council's exhibition Recent British Sculpture, a selection of works
lately acquired for its, that is to say our collection, says it all.
The introductory paragraph is itself a collector's item. 'What is
Sculpture?', it asks itself. 'Once upon a time this question was quite easy
to answer. A sculpture was solid and three-dimensional, not flat like a
picture. It could be big or small, but it generally stood on a plinth, not
on the floor. It was usually carved from stone or wood, or modelled in clay
and cast in metal. Sculpture was mostly about people and animals - people in
particular. It didn't move. Not any more.'
The statement is breath-taking in its complacency. Thus is written off in an
easy, thoughtless antithesis the universal tradition that by now should
embrace the cumulate experience of the millenia, from the earliest of
civilisations to our own, from the Willendorf Venus to Henry Moore, from
Easter Island to the bronzes of Benin, the great Buddha of Nara, the tombs
of the Pharaohs, the totems of the Pacific, the figures of Michelangelo.
Plinths indeed: people and animals forsooth: so that is what it was about
all that time.
That such simple-minded fatuities should be uttered in the name of education
is merely the measure of how far we have come. That is not to say that all
the works on show are therefore without merit. The point lies rather with
the critical assumption behind the selection, and the clear signal given to
young minds, that we need no longer bother ourselves with all that boring,
old-fashioned, disciplined, difficult, dusty stuff. Chuck it all out along
with the life-model, the cast from the Antique, the museum cabinet. Nowadays
anything goes: do your own thing: art is whatever you like to say art is:
what fun.
It is the philosophy of play-pit self-expression, visual joke and glib idea
as substitute for the creative and the profound. No monuments to mortality
here, but plenty of bright ideas. Richard Wentworth is one of the most
thoughtful sculptors we have, with an aesthete's fastidiousness in the
formal control and disposition of his materials, and a surrealist's wit in
the redeployment of given objects. His 'Toy' has a sardine-tin set as it
were floating in a now solid galvanised tub, an object as simple as it is
ambiguous and imaginatively satisfying. 'Richard Wentworth', we are told,
'says that he thinks of his studio . . . as 'the playroom where I'm not told
to tidy up''. He should be ashamed of himself.
Bill Woodrow's black crow tearing at carrion is as elegantly clever a thing
as he, so clever a sculptor, has ever done. David Nash's small and rudely
carved 'Coal Stove' is a nicely contradictory conceit, an image at once
purposeful and impractical. Less convincing and more literary in her
ambiguity, Cornelia Parker has made several hundred lead casts of a Big Ben
souvenir which she has arranged in a cone-like heap that spreads out in
neat, widening circles on the floor - 'Fleeting Monument', time passing,
mutability, leaden symbolism.
This is indeed a literary, concept-driven collection. Ron Haselden, with his
clicking, flickering, electronic 'Red Nose', an engagingly casual assemblage
of eviscerated cameras and naked circuitry, hints, we are told in the
catalogue, 'at deeper concerns and questions the role of the camera - a
machine . . . which is sometimes said to 'capture' its subjects.' On we go:
'Indirect Lighting, like much of Julian Opie's work, treads a very wary path
between the languages of high art and of mass design.' 'Stephen Hughes
('Container One') has explored the concept of containment in various
materials and forms over a number of years.' 'Territorial explores Veronica
Ryan's concern with boundaries and the edges of things.'
Such is the current jargon of justification. Sculpture is no longer simply
what it is, ambiguous, intuitive, inarticulate, magical. It must be about
this, concerned with that, take an interest, explore ideas, strike an
attitude. Antony Gormley's 'Five Fishes' consists of five long objects, such
as a truncheon or a blade, each encased in lead. Lead, he tells us, 'is a
material of transmutation and insulation: death to the object - a removal
from sight to be reborn in another place of the mind where differentiation
has not occurred . . . This work abolishes time by removing objects from its
flow and represents a moment of Adamic naming where evil coexists with
good.' How silly of me: of course it does.
From all this earnest company, Dhruva Mistry stands apart, the one sculptor
allowed to acknowledge the wider tradition of the figure and the humane
response, ancient Indian at one with modern and European. Here, even on the
smallest scale, in his fractured carving of a reclining woman, he achieves
the monumental.
The sculptor is free, of course, to use whatever materials he feels
appropriate to his purposes, and in whatever way. It is only the narrow
critical exclusivity that is worrying, as though to say: only such an
approach or interest is valid. 'During the last decade', says the catalogue,
'British sculpture has received international acclaim.' Did it then receive
none in the 1940s, with Moore and Hepworth, none in the 1950s with Turnbull,
Paolozzi, Armitage, Butler, none in the 1960s with Caro, King, Tucker, none
in the 1970s with Long and Flanagan? So where in the collection are all the
others, the carvers and modellers among them, even now still hard at work?
'Such a wealth of talent has emerged of late that it has been impossible for
the Collection to acquire work by all artists of importance.' So that is all
right then.

It would, I suppose, be too much to expect the broadcasters to tag half a
dozen of tonight's programmes with a little logo saying 'Old Series' yet
that would make at least as much sense as the logo saying 'New Series' which
is applied to such vintage titles as Tomorrow's World which is in its 29th
year. Tonight's subjects include the training of fire fighters in a mock-up

That is followed by the 'new' series Bruce Forsyth's Generation Game which
is in its 23rd year. When Brucey says 'Nice to see you, to see you. . . .'
millions of viewers will growl 'Nice', and most will declare 'Cuddly toy'
before he does when the time comes to recall the prizes on the conveyor belt
(8.00 BBC1). Other series returning tonight include the ITV game show Family
Fortunes, (7.00) and Channel 4's series about education, Class Action
(8.00).
The oddest and perhaps most promising programme of the day is Feed (11.55
BBC2). It consists of unguarded moments recorded in television studios
during the 1992 New Hampshire US presidential primary.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: Twinkle of a fresh talent - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, a concert by George Benjamin and
his young Premiere Ensemble included a remarkably appealing discovery: Unsuk
Chin, a 32-year-old Korean composer from Seoul. Benjamin came upon her Seven
Fairytales just a few months ago, while serving on a Paris competition-jury.
Taking her inspiration from mini-tales secreted in Alice Through the Looking
Glass and Michael Ende's The Endless Story, Unsuk Chin has fractured those
texts - hence her subtitle, 'Akrostichon-Wortspiel': perhaps you need to be
Korean to believe that Western words sung backwards will retain their
'symbolic meaning' - and has set them for soprano and a tingling little
ensemble. The results betoken a clever, original ear. Not so original as to
conceal debts to her teacher Ligeti and to Gyorgy Kurtag; but overall the
bright fantasy, economy and pungency of this sequence ring too consistently
true to be anyone's but her own.
Though the seven settings share a family resemblance (a taste for whispered,
spidery intricacies, for piercing pedal-notes in extreme registers, for
sudden plainness after busy instrumental textures), each has its special
ear-catching character. Genuinely fabulous, they twinkle and tantalise. We
must hear more of her.
We had a lot of Benjamin, in his expert and various roles as conductor,
pianist and composer; in his own programme-notes, too, with some discreet
polemic about Webern's restricted, 'weightless' style (which 'proved so
thrilling to the ears and minds' of 1950s composers, 'although that time is
now well past': Benjamin is an 1980s composer) and conversely about the
'egotistic excesses of romanticism, still resonant in our own decade'. He
conducted Webern's gentle 12-note Symphony op. 21 quite simply, without
special pointing, though as pianist in the accompanying trio for Ravel's
three Chansons madecasses he underlined the most telling strokes with a
fellow-professional's relish.
After her poised Fairytales, the soprano Penelope Walmsley-Clark sang the
mould-breaking Ravel triptych so beautifully, and fixed the distinct persona
of each song with such assured elegance, as to disarm my settled prejudice
against non-mezzos in this music. Her clear, cultivated French almost
compensated for the omission of the texts from the programme-book.
Gerard Grisey's microtonal experiments for a pair of horns, Accords perdus,
generated some intriguing aural cross-talk, but little more. In Varese's
Octandre Benjamin concentrated on hyper-subtle detail, at some cost to its
raw energy. His own At First Light, which had a rapturous welcome in 1982,
sounded more prettily episodic and less gripping than one remembered it from
London Sinfonietta performances. The Premiere Ensemble, excellent though it
is, has not risen yet to the Sinfonietta's level of forceful, single-minded
conviction.

truants.
The electronic attendance registration system - Ears - is a computer tablet
in a folder. Each time the teacher takes the register the pupils name is
ticked off on the screen. This information is sent by radio to the central
computer in the school office where it is collated.
The system, developed by Bromcom Computers, can even write to the parents of
missing pupils. Bromcom: 081 461 3737.

Designers may love the flashy graphics and revolving images on their
computers, but they still need models to display what their ideas will look
like, writes Andrew Fisher. Vu Thru, of London, has come up with a novel way
of showing designs in three-dimensional form.
This is achieved by stacking printed information on optically clear film
between Perspex layers. The film sheets are taken as slices of a
computer-generated graphic and printed with a thermal plotter. The contoured
slices, 20 or more, are bolted together to produce the image. Vu Thru: UK,

printing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With the proliferation of colour PCs and software has grown the demand for
colour printing. But colour printers have been too expensive for many
businesses.
QMS, of Mobile, Alabama, has launched a departmental desk-top colour laser
printer for less than Pounds 10,000.
The company has reduced the size and cost of the machine by replacing the
multiple marking engines - one for each colour ink - with a single unit. In
the Laser 1000 a belt circulates to pick up the ink from the four separate
hoppers and deliver it to the marking engine. This is then transferred to
the drum and on to the paper.
The Laser 1000 will print two pages of colour documentation a minute at the
cost of at least 5p per page. QMS: US, 205 633 4300; UK, 0784 430900.

Twenty-five years after the launch of the first quartz wristwatch, Japanese
manufacturer Seiko has launched the first quartz watch to work on kinetic
energy.
Instead of the traditional battery the watch is powered by the movement of
the wearer.
Sitting behind the watch face is a semi-circular rotor, which rotates with
the movement of the wrist. This is attached to a motion-powered generator,
smaller than the head of a match, which can generate up to 2.5 volts of
electricity. A microprocessor ensures that the quartz crystal receives the
required one-volt supply, and despatches the surplus power to a capacitor,
where it is stored for up to a week.
Three minutes of activity will generate enough energy to power the watch for
five hours. Ten hours of normal activity will power the watch for three
days.
At up to Pounds 200 each, the range of 10 watches is targeted at the top 5
per cent of watch wearers. Seiko: UK, 0628 770001.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology: A flat vision of the future - A new type of
television screen promises to shake up the global market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consumer electronics industry has been searching desperately for ways to
revitalise the television market. There has been much excitement in the
industry over wide-screen television and, further ahead, high-definition
equipment.
But a different kind of television unveiled by Matsushita Electric of Japan
could be just what the industry needs to spark demand among consumers for
new sets.
Matsushita's television boasts a flat screen that is a third of the depth of
conventional sets. Matsushita calls the new product Flat Vision and believes
it can capture more than 10 per cent of the world's display market by the
end of the decade.
The 14-inch television, which Matsushita will sell in Japan from October 1,
has a screen that is less than 10cm in depth, compared with about 34cms for
conventional televisions of the same size which use cathode ray tubes.
Matsushita also plans to introduce computers and multimedia devices using
the flat panel. If the company succeeds in overcoming some technological
hitches, televisions on the wall may become a reality earlier than expected.
The starting point for Flat Vision lay in what appears to have been an
inspiration from the research and development staff at Matsushita. While
consumer electronics makers have tried to make thinner televisons, doing so
with conventional technology, which uses CRTs, was always a problem. CRTs
are necessarily bulky, with an electron beam at the back of the tube to scan
colour dots on the screen's face and produce a moving picture. The tubes are
thick to allow the electron beam enough room to be bent to reach the outer
edges of the screen.
Matsushita has overcome the problem by replacing the bulky electron beam
with a matrix of 9,746 tiny tubes that are lined up to form the shape of a
television screen.
Flat Vision consists of 44 vertical wire cathode tubes, with 222 minitubes
per wire cathode on the backplate which emit the electrons. There are five
control plates and a fluorescent surface with colour phosphor strips on the
surface.
The picture is created through the illumination of the fluorescent front
surface by the electrons, with a separate electron beam source for each of
the 9,746 tubes. Each minitube thus acts like a CRT, scanning six lines of
two sets of the three colour elements (red, blue and green) to form the
picture.
Flat Vision retains the CRT advantage of being self-illuminating and
therefore very bright. 'By allocating only small areas of the display to
each electron beam source, the company was able to achieve a much slimmer
body than if one electron beam was responsible for the entire display area,'
Matsushita says.
The closeness of the cathode to the faceplate, the fluorescent surface which
contains colour dots, means it is easy to aim the electron beam to the
proper colour and this enhances the picture clarity and brightness. Since
the Flat Vision screen has a grid of small CRTs there is no blurring at the
edges of the screen, allowing a wider viewing angle than conventional
televisions.
There is still much to be improved upon in Matsushita's screen. The company
admits that because the glass of the screen is flat, it is not as strong as
the curved CRT screen and is therefore more vulnerable to pressure. This
makes it difficult to produce televisions larger than 20 inches until a
further breakthrough in the technology.
The electronics team at SG Warburg, the securities company, believes that
because Flat Vision splits up the screen into a large number of minitubes it
creates faint horizontal lines on the screen in high-resolution
applications, making Flat Vision in its current state unsuitable for
high-definition television.
Its high power consumption also means it is unlikely to become a viable
alternative to liquid crystal display technology found in portable
applications, SG Warburg says.
Matsushita's Flat Vision product will go on sale in Japan at a cost of
Y288,000 (Pounds 1,811). The company initially plans 1,000 units to be
produced a month.
By 2000, Matsushita believes that Flat Vision will sell about 25m units
annually, or more than 10 per cent of the annual worldwide display market
which it forecasts will be 217m units, up from 140m units today, including
CRT and LCD devices.
To meet its forecasts the company plans to start licensing the technology,
for which it already has over 133 domestic patents, to third parties. It has
applied for another 1,300 patents in Japan.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology: At the Sharp end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 20 years have passed since Sharp, the Japanese electronics company,
launched the world's first calculator that used a liquid crystal display.
Sharp has placed LCDs firmly at the centre of its devices business, which it
believes will provide the company with a big advantage over other consumer
electronics makers by helping it to differentiate its products from those of
its competitors.
The number of R&amp;D staff working on LCD has increased sixfold over the past
six years to 1,000 and LCD-related capital expenditure has ballooned to
Y100bn (Pounds 630m) over the past three years.
The company is already seeing the beneficial effect its expertise in LCD can
have on its consumer electronics business.
Sharp's camcorder, known in Japan as the ViewCam, uses a four-inch liquid
crystal monitor instead of a viewfinder, and is doing well in the domestic
market despite sluggish demand for camcorders. Sharp's share of this market
is expected to surge on the strength of the ViewCam.
The LCD monitor is big enough for on-the-spot viewing and can be rotated 270
degrees for shooting from a variety of angles. The great advantage of the
LCD monitor is that there is no need to keep your eye glued to the
viewfinder. You can shoot scenes even if stuck behind a crowd.
Sharp is also concentrating on LCD television. One of its latest products,
the Crystaltron, is a portable television which uses a low-reflectivity
thin-film transistor LCD.
A big problem with portable televisions has been the difficulty of getting
clear pictures outdoors. Because LCDs do not emit light on their own but
need to use a backlight, they are more likely to lose picture brightness
than CRTs when another light source interferes.
Sharp has improved the brightness of the Crystaltron by using a stronger but
smaller back light, together with a low-reflectivity LCD panel and by
replacing the glass of the front cover with a low-reflectivity material.
In order to improve picture quality, Sharp was able to increase the amount
of light that reaches the eye after passing through the LCD panel. In the
past, only about 40 per cent of the light penetrated the LCD panel, but this
has been increased to 48 per cent.
Another product using LCD into which Sharp has been putting its energies is
projection television. LCD panels are placed inside the projector which
makes it much easier to set up than conventional televisions, and portable
as well.
Since conventional television uses tubes which bend under the influence of
the earth's magnetism, they need to be adjusted each time they are set up in
a different place. With LCD projection television, that problem is
eliminated altogether, says Takashi Matsumoto, general manager of Sharp's
LCD visual systems division.
Sharp has developed a 2.8-inch high-density LCD panel with 217,945 pixels
for the system. By combining three of these panels its projection television
produces high quality resulting from 653,835 pixels.
There are a number of problems that continue to plague LCDs. Not least is
the technological complexity of producing them, which makes LCDs both costly
and difficult to make in larger sizes. But the light weight, low-power
consumption and flatness of the screens give LCDs an advantage in portable
applications that is hard to beat.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Property: 'Gold fever' gives way to sober realism -
Budapest's developers are cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euphoria that characterised Budapest's property sector at the turn of
the decade has given way to sober realism.
According to the city authorities which are trying to sell off state-owned
property, the market has slowed down. 'The real estate market has collapsed
in the past two years,' says Mr Gabor Demszky, mayor of Budapest.
He fears that demand for property has dropped so sharply that the city may
not achieve its target of Ft6bn-Ft10bn in property sales this year. It is
far cry from 1990-91, when interest in property was 'like a gold fever',
according to Mr Demszky. 'Every day dozens of foreigners wanted to meet me
because of real estate,' he says.
But while developers are no longer beating a path to the mayor's door,
agents in Budapest challenge the assertion that the market has collapsed.
Supply and demand are in a good balance, with over-supply of 1 per cent.
Rents for the best buildings have held at a monthly rate of about DM50 per
square metre, though for some less well-located buildings the rates have
fallen to DM30.
The recession in property markets worldwide, together with a less bullish
attitude to the domestic sector's prospects have prevented any speculative
excesses in Hungary.
Developers have therefore resisted starting new developments because of
concern about the possibility of oversupply, the difficulty of raising
finance without pre-lets and the problem of selling completed buildings.
The result of this caution has been a relatively prompt take-up for
completed buildings. Since 1988, 280,000 sq m of office stock has been
completed. Take-up this year is likely to be about 80,000 sq m-100,000 sq m,
according to Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors.
Investors for completed, let buildings are currently a rare breed. 'You can
assume that the majority of buildings are potentially for sale,' says Mr
Michael Hodges of Jones Lang Wootton. So far, there have been a bare handful
of investment deals. Two small office buildings were bought by Dutch
investors last year on yields of between 13 per cent and 14 per cent.
The slow development of Budapest's investment market is partly explained by
the problems endured by markets in other countries in recent years. Those
investors which are in a position to make purchases have been able to obtain
high yielding buildings in more established markets.
Investors might also be deterred by relatively short leases. 'For the
development of the investment market, we need more buildings with good
covenants and good lease structures,' says Mr Michael Carroll of Healey &amp;
Baker, the surveyors.
Moreover, potential investors do not believe returns are high enough to
compensate for the extra risks associated with an unstable economy and the
non-convertibility of the forint.
Some commentators blame property owners for having an inflexible position on
the value of their property. 'If prices stay as high, there is no chance of
inviting foreigners to invest here,' says Mr Peter Keszthelyi of the
Budapest Chamber of Commerce.
But developers baulk at dropping their asking prices, given the high cost of
building in Hungary, which is not much cheaper than in neighbouring
countries. Developers must contend with heavy duties on imported building
materials, lengthy planning procedures and onerous financing costs.
Moreover, the authorities are reluctant to sell land cheaply. 'We have
long-term goals. The city is waiting for a good time to sell it (property)
at the right price,' says Mr Janos Haszonits of the city's enterprise
department,
Compared with other central and eastern European countries, there are
relatively few problems in establishing a claim to land. 'The land registry
has, for the most part, been carefully maintained. It is functioning well,'
says Mr Wolfgang Dorn-Zachertz of the law firm, Punder, Volhard, Weber &amp;
Axster.
The legal system also presents few problems, he says. Even so, investors
still need to confront the complexities of the ownership structure, which
compels buyers to undertake tortuous negotiations with different state
organisations. Complications arise because state-owned property is
administered by several entities.
Developers also have to grapple with a complex planning system. Applications
are supposed to take more no than 30 days to process; but in reality they
take a lot longer. 'The bureaucratic procedures have not been reduced by the
change of regime,' says Ms Katalin Pongracz, of the city's special planning
department.
The structure of the planning authorities in Budapest is complex, involving
six departments at the town hall and 22 local districts. Winning agreement
for the city's new development plan, which replaces the old regime's 1988
plan will therefore be complicated.
The main proposals in the development plan, according to Ms Pongracz, are:
to ensure that the density and size of the city are contained;
to improve the quality of living accommodation;
to upgrade infrastructure and transport facilities;
and to improve green areas and ensure the old parts of the city are restored
before greenfield sites are developed.
'There is a special character of Budapest which we are not going to
destroy,' says Ms Pongracz.

FT  10 SEP 93 / People: QMH: Cairns and Bould check in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Coppel, the chief executive charged with sorting out the affairs of
Queens Moat Houses, is still unable to explain exactly what went wrong at
the hotel group, whose shares were suspended last March.
He has, however, recruited two new senior executives charged with finding
ways of turning the group's 191 hotels in the UK and continental Europe into
a viable business.
Michael Cairns, 53, is to join the board as chief operating officer, hotels
on September 20. Cairns has been with Inter-Continental Hotels for 25 years,
most recently managing its European, Middle Eastern and African properties.
He is also managing director of Saison Overseas Holdings,
Inter-Continental's parent company.
The second appointee is Andrew Bould, 45, senior vice president of sales and
marketing at HiltonInternational, who is to become managing director of
Queens Moat's UK hotels division.
Bould's appointment is in line with Coppel's view that the UK business needs
its own chief executive, rather than being run directly by group head
office, as under the previous management.
Coppel says Cairns will need to grapple with markedly different problems in
the UK and Germany, the group's two most important markets.
In Germany, Coppel found that the hotels had been reasonably well-managed
under the old regime, with proper financial controls. The difficulty is the
country's economic downturn, which has damaged trading.
In the UK, where hoteliers say business is picking up, Cairns and Bould need
to decide what to do about the management weaknesses which existed before
the shares were suspended. These include the management incentive scheme,
which went badly wrong, and the branding and marketing of the hotels.

<TEXT>
Tomorrows Leisure, the USM-quoted, Newcastle-based hotels and leisure group
which had been on a roller-coaster of management changes in recent months,
has appointed Chris Blaxall as managing director.
Blaxall, 36, has come from the Consett, Co Durham-based Derwent Valley Food
Group, best known for its 'Phileas Fogg' snack range, where he was group
finance director.
Blaxall is Tomorrows Leisure's third managing director in as many months. He
succeeds Stephen Lovely, who held the post for three weeks before resigning
with immediate effect in late July. Lovely replaced Malcolm Powell, who then
became operations director, a post from which he has now resigned.
In July Tomorrows Leisure gave a second loss warning for its results for the
year to March 31, which have yet to be published. It also announced at that
time that John Roberts, a former Next director brought in in February as
chairman, had resigned and that founder John Sanderson, who stepped down as
chairman and managing director in the February reshuffle, had become
executive chairman.
Blaxall, a chartered accountant, assisted the founder directors of Derwent
Valley Food Group, which he joined in 1991, in refocusing the business back
to its core activities and selling it to United Biscuits for Pounds 27m in
March.

FT  10 SEP 93 / People: GKN finds finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive components and industrial services group GKN is at last filling
the finance director's seat left vacant by Brian Walsh's departure to the TI
Group in April.
About to get his feet under Walsh's old desk at GKN's London headquarters is
48-year-old Merseysider David Turner, who has been finance director of food
distribution and agri-business conglomerate Booker for the past nine years.
Turner, a chartered accountant whose career included spells with Touche Ross
and Mobil Oil before signing up with Booker as a financial controller in
1975, is expected to take up the post 'in the next month or two', according
to GKN.
The lack of apparent urgency might seem somewhat surprising, given the
length of time since Walsh's departure. But costs are well battened down,
recession is starting to abate and the rest of GKN's hierarchy has been
stable for some time.
Not least, hands-on chairman Sir David Lees himself had a lengthy stint as
finance director before climbing the last few rungs of the corporate
rigging. 'So the ship of finance has been able to sail serenely on,'
according to one GKN insider.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Management: Rockwell's Czech mate - The problems of
establishing ventures in east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an unusual door into one of the four plants at Liberec, 80km
north-east of Prague, where Rockwell International, the US multinational, is
making its first foray into motor components manufacturing in eastern
Europe. Flanked by high railings it is big enough to take a bus.
Until the late 1980s it did. The political prisoners the bus disgorged daily
assembled door and window mechanisms for the Skoda cars being made - now
under Volkswagen's control - at nearby Mlada Boleslav. To minimise sabotage
risks, production was reduced to many simple operations, each numbingly
repetitive. Today paid employees have replaced the prisoners. But the
tedious tasks remain.
The facility illustrates practical hurdles western companies face in seeking
to turn formerly Communist state-owned companies into competitive businesses
with which they hope to exploit growth prospects in central and eastern
Europe. Not least, it helps shed light on some of the wider frustrations VW
claims to be experiencing over its commitment - as part of taking over
control of Skoda - to help develop a competitive Czech motor components
industry.
In the past few days the German company seeking to improve Skoda's
productivity and compensate for rising costs has raised Skoda prices and is
threatening to import more components from the west. As a consequence, Jan
Peer, the Czech-born executive appointed by Rockwell nearly two years ago to
run the Liberec operation, is under more pressure to demonstrate the venture
can work.
Last month, during his first full meeting with the 462-strong workforce,
Peer expounded Rockwell's ambitions for Liberec.
His final slide concluded 'and let's have some fun'. There was a puzzled
pause before nervous grins spread among the dour Czech ranks, speaking
volumes about the working culture of plants carrying the legacy of 40 years
of Communism. Nevertheless Peer, who moved to the US when he was 18,
believes that Rockwell BCS-Liberec, the enterprise's new name (the BCS
stands for Body Chassis Systems, one of Rockwell's global divisions), can be
a 'world class' constituent of Rockwell's global vehicle components business
in the next few years.
Until privatisation, Liberec was purely a Skoda components arm. Skoda
remains its only customer, supplied with the mechanisms which raise and
lower windows, seat slides and sunroofs. But Liberec, which is to supply
sunroofs for a high-volume, German-built small car to be launched in 1995,
will soon start making sunvisors for another European producer, and is
exploring other opportunities. From mid-1994 it will also benefit from
increased production of an updated Skoda Favorit, the first step of a DM9bn
(Pounds 3.6bn) investment programme at Skoda leading to new families of
cars.
The task ahead, however, is formidable. While Peer was seeing the work
force, the bare, wooden floors were echoing to the clatter of a VW team
arriving for the second quality audit since he took over. VW has made clear
it expects Rockwell to match VW's quality blitz on the Skoda assembly lines.
The challenge for Peer and his team of Czech managers is how best to
motivate and organise employees into teams responsible for their own quality
while continually looking for improvements - ingredients of total quality
management systems becoming the western norm.
Peer says that there are 60 per cent more indirect workers than production
employees. 'That's two and a half times as bad as in western plants.'
Given that Rockwell must make best efforts under the deal to maintain
employment for three years, the obvious solution might be to retrain
indirect workers for increased production. But Peer expects some to leave
rather than accept perceived loss of status or shift requirements. By at
least making the offer, Rockwell will not breach the employment guarantee.
And such departures could ease the task of restructuring.
'Over 40 years a whole system has been built on total mistrust, with
managers resistant to taking on any new tasks or being held in any way
accountable - there is always a bunch of signatures on any document.'
For Liberec to work, Peer says there must be accountability without fear.
'Total quality management is built on the principle of openness. So there
has got to be a total lack of fear on behalf of the creator of a defect. But
workers here were financially punished for creating a defect. What sort of
attitudes does that create?'
Uncertainty among Liberec managers has also not been helped by VW importing
senior German managers to Skoda. Peer insists that Rockwell will not do the
same and when he leaves, his successor will be Czech.
But after some organisational and management changes he is detecting
positive attitude shifts. The first work teams are being formed and quality
improvement programmes are gaining momentum. Management training has
started, with engineers being sent to other Rockwell centres to learn
systems.
But plant and equipment problems abound. Some is adequate and even modern -
as with some presses - but occasionally it is downright bizarre. The worst
horrors will fade from Liberec as part of Rockwell's Dollars 6m (Pounds
3.8m) investment commitment, which will also see the semi-automation of
assembly processes.
But given the employment guarantees modernisation cannot come with a rush.
To facilitate it, work is accelerating on bringing in the computer-aided
design and engineering systems integral to Rockwell plants in the west, and
of which Liberec will form part of a global matrix.
Peer says there are islands of good existing technology, even by western
standards. With its low labour rates, it could become a cost-effective
supplier of parts for the more complex component systems supplied by
Rockwell in the west.
Far from deterred by its Liberec experience to date, Rockwell sees the
operations as a potential springboard for other ventures in eastern Europe.
VW, for one, hopes fervently it is right.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Management: The dangers of a culture crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is an old trick, played most often in euphemism-loving America, for two
companies to describe the takeover of one by the other as 'a merger'. It
makes both top managements feel more comfortable about the deal, and for a
while mollifies all the other 'stakeholders' concerned. Goliath swallows
David, but they tell shareholders, employees, governments and local
communities they are 'merging'.
A few years down the road the truth becomes all too obvious. Not only has
the senior partner swallowed the junior, but frequently it has also
destroyed most of the latter's special skills - the very things which helped
prompt the acquisition in the first place.
From the signs of the past few days, this is all too likely to be the way
things turn out once giant Renault and tiny Volvo consummate the 'marriage'
which they announced this week.
Most French observers certainly expect Renault to dominate. In its main
headlines about the deal, the influential newspaper Le Monde toed the
official line about 'fusion' (merger), but gave the game away on an inside
page with a sub-heading which read starkly: 'L'absorption par Renault'.
For Volvo to go the way of so many acquired companies in the past would be a
tragedy. This is not just because of its innovative skills in production and
international management.
Far more important is that this would destroy what could otherwise have been
the potential for Renault-Volvo, like ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) before it, to
become an entirely new European company, capable through leanness, speed and
flexibility, of challenging the toughest competition that either the US or
Japan could throw at it.
Supporters of Louis Schweitzer, the purportedly internationalist and
certainly ambitious head of Renault, will protest that this is exactly his
intention.
If so, he has already, in several senses, fluffed his first chance. Instead
of locating the head office of the new group at Renault's existing HQ in
western Paris - with twin offshoots there and in Gothenburg - he should have
made the classic move of a 'transformational' leader: broken sharply with
the company's past by choosing a fresh site elsewhere.
Since national politics make a move to neutral Belgium or the Netherlands
impossible, he could at least have moved the HQ to the other side of town.
Percy Barnevik, the Swede who heads ABB, took such a step by locating its
new HQ in Zurich, a short but significant distance from Brown Boveri's old
Baden office.
Actions of this kind are far from merely symbolic: they tend to energise
management when a company is faced with any kind of radical change. Not for
nothing did AT&amp;T move out of its pompous Philip Johnson-designed Manhattan
skyscraper when it was forced to revitalise itself. The reformist new boss
of troubled Digital Equipment has just taken a similar decision to leave the
Massachusetts mill where it has been since birth. If Louis Gerstner is well
advised in his battle to stop IBM from sinking, he will abandon the
company's plush HQ in leafy Armonk.
A second immediate step by Schweitzer should have been to declare that the
Paris head office will be staffed entirely on merit by a wide range of
nationalities, including Swedes, Dutch and Americans. Otherwise, the
suspicion must be that it will be dominated by the French. The equivalent
worry would apply equally to a Swedish, Dutch, American or British parent
company.
It is not too late for Schweitzer to make such a move: he could still change
course before January, the date by which he has said the details of senior
staffing arrangements will be settled. To hold back until after the
subsequent privatisation would lose precious time, and also forego (taking)
a step towards internationalisation which would make Renault-Volvo more
attractive to private investors. Delaying would also provoke more resistance
among his French staff.
The nationality of key staff is closely linked with the question of what
sort of organisational and 'culture change' processes Schweitzer intends to
initiate across and down the company. Even if it were not swallowing Volvo,
Renault would have had to undergo a wrenching series of such changes as it
emerged from the protective arm of the state. Now, the challenge will be all
the greater.
Rather than 'fusing' the two cultures, as commentators have suggested, his
objective must be to create an entirely new culture, as Barnevik has done at
ABB. This will undoubtedly require some existing elements from both sides,
such as Renault's emphasis on flair and adventure in design and marketing,
and Volvo's greater informality and internationalism.
Injecting each of these into the other side will be hard enough. But if, as
at ABB, Renault and Volvo are to develop quickly the vital unifying sense of
building a new world together - which requires much more than just using a
newly decreed language (English) - they must also borrow from around the
world fresh attitudes, disciplines and procedures.
Given the gulf between typical French and Swedish attitudes to such basic
management variables as authority, delegation and uncertainty, Schweitzer's
task here will be tough indeed. He will find it a little easier if he can
bring himself to hold up an Americanised version of Swedish culture - more
decisive and entrepreneurial - as a model at which to aim.
By no means all of this can be done quickly; creating ABB has so far taken
Barnevik five years. But for any of it to succeed, Schweitzer needs to get
off on the right foot.
In spite of his stumbles this week, he still has time to do so. The best way
of doing that would be to behave internally, not just towards the media, as
if the deal really is a merger.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (8): A record
flotation - Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN)

THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange is to get a much-needed boost next year when
the government floats a first tranche of shares in its 100 per cent-owned
postal and telecommunications company, Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN).
For the bourse, the launch will represent a vitally important injection of
new blood following a steady thinning in the ranks of Amsterdam's listed
companies as a result of recent mergers in the paper, foods and banking
sectors.
But for KPN itself, the flotation will be equally significant, marking a new
stage in its determined efforts to become an internationally-recognised
provider of postal and telecommunication services.
'If we remained a state-owned company, our world expansion plans would come
to nothing,' says Mr Wim Dik, KPN's chairman. 'No state-owned company could
pull it off.'
KPN is well aware that it cannot hope to meet its international goals on its
own, particularly in telecommunications where investments are heavy, change
is rapid and companies like AT&amp;T are engaged in expensive acquisitions.
Ultimately, the flotation is aimed at putting KPN in a position to find
additional strategic partners to realise its international ambitions.
The Amsterdam listing opens up the possibility of arranging cross-stakes in
share capital, if necessary, to cement a strategic partnership.
'Our desire to be launched on the bourse is not based in the first instance
on a need for capital,' says Mr Dik.
So far in the 1990s KPN has concluded a number of far-reaching strategic
alliances. The most significant is its participation in Unisource, a
three-way partnership with Sweden's Telia and Swiss Telecom aimed at
providing specialised telecommunications for multinational companies.
On the postal side, KPN has also linked up with TNT of Australia and the
postal authorities of Germany, France, Sweden and Canada to form a joint
venture in international express mail.
In eastern Europe, KPN is helping to improve the telecommunications networks
of Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
By becoming a listed company, KPN hopes to make it easier to conclude
business partnerships, especially with US companies which previously found
it difficult to understand the Dutch company's anomalous role as a fully
commercial organisation whose shares happened to be owned by the state.
IN Dutch terms, KPN's 'privatisation' took place in 1989, when the former
government agency was transformed into a public limited company accountable
to a supervisory board rather than to the ministry of public works.
Although the state retained its 100 per cent share holding, KPN was free to
act like a private-sector company. An immediate priority was to train its
102,000 staff - all former civil servants - to be customer and
market-orientated.
KPN's five-year transformation will be capped in the the first half of 1994
with the sale of 20-30 per cent of the state's shares. In later tranches,
the government intends to reduce its stake below 50 per cent, though it will
retain a 'golden share.'
Estimates of KPN's total market value range up to Fl 22bn. However, the
price of the shares will depend largely on the company's future dividend
policy, as KPN will be seen primarily as a yield stock. KPN currently pays
out 40 per cent of net profits to the state.
The initial flotation will not only rank as the biggest in Dutch history,
exceeding the launch of the chemicals group DSM in the late 1980s, but it
will also mark the country's first privatisation of a household name.
Although the holding company KPN may not be immediately recognisable to many
Dutch people, the term 'PTT' (post, telephone and telegraph) certainly is.
All phone users are customers of PTT Telecom, one of KPN's two main
operating companies, while PTT Post is familiar to millions as the place to
go to buy stamps or to access the services of the Postbank, which belongs to
the ING Group.
Mr Dik, a former senior executive at Unilever, recalls a consultant at KPN
in the late 1980s who proposed that the name PTT be dropped. This suggestion
was flatly rejected. It would have been crazy, he says, 'to discard a brand
name when 99 per cent of our customers knows exactly what it stands for.'
KPN's flotation - the first of a string of share launches by continental
telecommunications companies such as Deutsche and France Telecom - is
unusual because the Dutch postal services will be included. But KPN's postal
operations are themselves unusual because they are profitable, unlike all
other post offices in Europe with the exception of Britain's Royal Mail.
'PTT Post is very healthy and achieves a return on invested capital that is
every bit comparable to that of PTT Telecom,' says Mr Dik.
KPN's international ambitions extend to postal operations as well as to the
more obvious area of telecommunications. Already, low Dutch postal rates
have enticed foreign companies to ship their European post to the
Netherlands for onward delivery elsewhere on the continent.
Potential expansion opportunities for PTT Post include international
consultancy as well as the setting up of postal services for other countries
and lending management support.
KPN as a whole intends to double its turnover by the year 2000.
The company, which posted 1992 net profit of Fl 1.66bn on turnover of Fl
15.62bn, says growth will come from the expansion of existing businesses
into new areas but also from acquisition.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (7): New urgency over
reforms - Amsterdam Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE its competitor on the other side of the English Channel, the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange has always avoided the 'Big Bang' approach to
change, preferring instead to pursue a rolling programme of reforms to
bolster its position in Europe.
But its plans for fundamental and far-reaching reform in early 1994 betray a
new sense of urgency, prompted by London's increasingly tight grip on block
trading in Dutch shares and government bonds.
To counter the attractions of London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation
System (SEAQ), the Amsterdam bourse will be offering a rival screen-based
system called ASSET (Amsterdam Stock Exchange Trading System) where banks
and brokers can advertise their prices. This will be supplemented by an
on-screen trading system called AIDA.
For the first time, foreign banks and brokers based outside the Netherlands
will be offered direct access to the Amsterdam market through the new screen
system, in a bid to persuade them to stop trading Dutch shares and
government bonds in London.
Equally important, the Amsterdam bourse wants competition from foreigners to
force domestic players to adopt a more aggressive stance in the market. The
screens will be used only in the wholesale segment market, which is to be
created through another dramatic reform ' the splitting of trading into
distinct retail and professional sectors.
Together, the advent of limited screen-based trading and the division of the
market between private and institutional investors will mean the demise of
the Amsterdam 'hoekman,' or stock jobber, a traditional feature of the Dutch
capital's stock exchange. It was the hoekmen's task to bring together supply
and demand, and most transactions had to be channeled through them.
The hoekman will disappear and be replaced by a market 'specialist,' similar
to those in New York, who will operate on the retail side of the market.
Rather than having two competing hoekman companies specialising in each
Dutch stock, the new specialist will have exclusive rights to deal in
individual companies' shares.
'The specialist will now have to compete against the market, instead of
against his 'hoekman' competitor,' Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, the
bourse's chairman, said in an interview.
The change will have radical consequences for the exchange's 23 'hoekman'
firms and their combined workforce of around 200. Less than 10 firms will be
eligible to become specialists, and they will all have to invest heavily in
new equipment. And, to survive in a new world of lower commission rates,
they will clearly have to boost their share volume.
Amsterdam's multiple moves to split the market, to allow in foreign-based
brokers and to do away with the old-style hoekman are a response to
surprising figures on trading in Dutch securities uncovered last year by
McKinsey &amp; Company, the consultants.
Although Amsterdam's low, 32 per cent share of trading in Dutch bonds had
been cause for concern for years, the McKinsey figures showed that share
trading had also undergone a profound shift to London.
The seepage to SEAQ was most pronounced in block trades worth more than Fl
1m each, with only 33 per cent of these deals done in Amsterdam in 1991
compared with 68 per cent in 1988. Overall, the Dutch exchange accounts for
60 per cent of dealings in Dutch securities, down from 80 per cent three
years earlier.
Mr van Ittersum said the 'shocking' figures had helped concentrate the
collective mind of the Amsterdam financial community, producing a consensus
for change.
The McKinsey report also found that investors were increasingly turning to
foreign banks and brokers when investing in Dutch shares, helping to
accelerate the trend towards SEAQ trading. It urged Dutch banks and brokers
to boost their competitiveness as well as their trading volume, and to be
prepared to offer more liquidity in the market. But Mr van Ittersum noted
that a change of mentality was needed in addition to the change in trading
methods - 'no matter how well-organised you are, you will lose out in the
end if the Amsterdam-based intermediaries are not competitive enough to win
back the business that has gone abroad,' he says.
Besides Amsterdam's comprehensive revamping of its trading system, the
bourse also faces the challenge later this year of incorporating its
lower-tier 'parallel market' into the main share market. The parallel
market, launched in 1982 as a breeding ground for smaller companies seeking
to graduate to the main bourse, has stagnated after a series of
well-publicised company failures dented its image.
Before the parallel market can be abolished, however, the bourse must
resolve the question of what admission conditions will govern the transfer
of stocks to the mainstream market.
Another issue coming to a head later this year is the desirability of
greater co-operation between the stock exchange and the Amsterdam-based
European Options Exchange.
The two exchanges have asked Coopers &amp; Lybrand to report this autumn on
potential areas for partnerships. In the first instance, the two markets are
interested in exploring cost-savings that could be generated by operating
joint back-room administration and legal services. However, a more
thorough-going link-up is also possible.
'There is no question of an automatic merger, but far-reaching co-operation
can also not be ruled out,' says Mr van Ittersum.
In the longer term, the stock exchange also wants to increase the number of
Dutch companies coming to the market. Next year's privatisation of the Dutch
PTT will be the biggest-ever flotation in the Amsterdam bourse's history
(see report below), but unlike France or Germany, where heavy privatisation
programmes should swell turnover in the years ahead, there are few
privatisation targets in the Netherlands, meaning that the bourse's ranks
can only be bolstered by newcomers from the private sector.
Mr van Ittersum says there are at least 200 medium-sized Dutch companies
'ripe' for flotation - 'we have a magnificent top league of bourse-listed
companies, but there's gap at the lower end,' he adds.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (5): Debate over
funds for industry - Concern over venture capital channels for promising
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL policy has become a hot topic in the Netherlands this year
following the demise and rebirth of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, and the sale
of a majority stake in Fokker, the aeroplane builder, to Daimler-Benz of
Germany.
Closely related to worries about the overall competitiveness of Dutch
industry is the more specific question of how venture capital can best be
channeled to the Netherlands' most promising companies.
It is clear that the availability of capital to young companies - as well as
to better-established industrial groups - is at something of a cross-roads.
First, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange's 'parallel market,' established 11
years ago as a place to groom smaller companies for a full listing on the
main market, is to be closed down later this year and incorporated into the
stock exchange itself. The market was too illiquid to attract institutional
investors, and its image was sullied by a number of controversial company
failures. The looming demise of the parallel market has raised concern about
the future flow of smaller companies on to the stock exchange. Much will
depend on whether new admission rules are eased sufficiently to encourage
newcomers.
The parallel market required companies to have market capitalisation of at
least Fl 5m, compared with the main market's minimum requirement of Fl 50m.
The bourse is being urged to lower this floor to around Fl 25m to make it
easier for companies to make an initial flotation.
In a second new development, the stock exchange and the Dutch venture
capital association NVP (Nederlandse Vereniging van
Participatiemaatschappijen) are preparing to hold their first 'participation
exchange' in late November, an opportunity for institutional investors to
buy substantial share packets in non-listed Dutch companies and a place
where venture capital funds can arrange 'exits' from their most successful
investments.
And finally, the government is trying to put together a Fl 880m 'Industry
Fund' to finance promising ventures and developments at eligible Dutch
companies, up to a maximum of Fl 50m per company. The country's banks,
insurers and pension funds will put up Fl 200 each, as will the ministry of
economic affairs. The semi-government-owned Nationale Investeringsbank,
which will manage the fund, is to contribute the remaining Fl 80m.
The funds are designed to help medium to large Dutch companies rather than
small or start-up firms. The aim is to give assistance to companies which
are at the centre of a high-technology 'cluster.'
The NVP has said that from the start that the fund is unnecessary, arguing
that there is no lack of venture capital in the Netherlands. In 1992, the
industry invested Fl 545m in promising companies, down from Fl 675m in 1991
but still at relatively high historical levels.
Mr Evert Elbertse, the NVP's secretary-general, said: 'If the government
believes there is too little money available, it could have done something
to help existing players make larger investments,' citing a government
matching scheme operated in the US.
The NVP says that to avoid as much overlap as possible in the market, the
new fund should concentrate on amounts above Fl 25m because the venture
capital market for amounts between Fl 10m-20m is already reasonably
developed.
The industry fund was originally scheduled to be launched in the early
summer but talks between the various participants have taken longer than
expected - 'we think the fund can get under way in the autumn,' a ministry
spokesman said.
The proposed fund is a government-sponsored response to concern about the
passing of Fokker into German hands and the collapse of Daf and its
subsequent resurrection in slimmed-down form without its former UK
operations.
IN the case of Daf, the Dutch government was prepared to pump money into the
new company, along with the Flemish regional government of Belgium and a
number of other investors, including Dutch venture capitalist firms.
But Fokker's sale to Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary was a
consequence of the Dutch government's refusal to help the company (in which
it held a 32 per cent stake after a cash crisis in the late 1980s) finance
the development of a new generation of aircraft.
As with Fokker, the government's financial involvement in Daf is designed to
be temporary. There is little tradition of state ownership of industry in
the Netherlands, nor do the country's banks tend to own large stakes in
companies, making either bourse flotation or venture-capital participation
essential.
The 'participation exchange", or 'parex,' scheduled to take place on
November 23, is designed specifically to help the Netherlands' rich
institutional investors to find appropriate investments in unlisted
companies.
The exchange, which will operate under a tender system, will allow for the
transfer of stakes equivalent to at least 5 per cent of a company's share
capital and worth a minimum of Fl 1m. Companies whose shares are up for sale
must have shown a profit for at least two years.
The difference between parex trading and a flotation on the stock exchange
is that companies whose shares are sold directly to institutional investors
by subscription do not have to meet the same strict financial reporting
criteria as those who go public in search of wider ownership.
Mr Elbertse said the first participation exchange in November may see
dealings in only one or two companies' shares because potential participants
will probably take a cautious stance at first. But he added that this could
act as a stimulus for future 'parex' days, which may then be organised every
six months, depending on demand.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (6): Reputation for
liberal tax laws - New US-Dutch treaty after a decade of complex
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's oldest double taxation treaty, the 1948 treaty between the
Netherlands and the US, is to give way to a new document believed to be the
most complex tax agreement ever concluded between two countries.
The new US-Netherlands treaty will replace an existing treaty dating from
1948. After more than 10 years of exhaustive negotiations, the two countries
signed a draft treaty in December 1992. If ratification proceeds smoothly -
and this is by no means certain - the treaty will take force on January 1,
1994, with companies given a one-year transitional phase before they need to
comply with its stipulations.
The revised treaty is attracting considerable international attention, not
because of any changes in withholding tax rates, but because of its
complicated Article 26, which sets out the 'limitations of benefits' and,
effectively, narrows the range of companies that are able to invoke
protection against double taxation.
The US, which is keen to counter 'treaty shopping' by companies seeking to
reduce their tax bills, is expected to use the treaty with the Netherlands
as a model for its future tax treaty relations with other industrialised
countries.
The Netherlands, for its part, has attempted to retain as many features of
the old treaty as possible, underlining its reputation as a country willing
to forego tax on interest payments, profits and royalties generated in third
countries.
This stance has given the Netherlands, though hardly a tax 'paradise' for
its own citizens and residents, a reputation for liberal tax laws for
international businesses.
The Netherlands' attempts to preserve this reputation and the US's desire to
rein in treaty shopping account for the long, arduous negotiations over the
new treaty's text, which runs to 100 pages, excluding a 35-page appendix.
The new US-Dutch treaty will make it difficult for 'mailbox' and
'brass-plate' companies to carry on benefiting from double taxation rules.
This is because the draft treaty includes exhaustive tests of how rooted a
company is in the Netherlands.
Previously, mere residence in the Netherlands was enough to enable a foreign
company to draw on the Netherlands-US tax treaty benefits. Now, eligibility
will have to be established by any of a variety of means, ranging from an
ownership and business activity test to a 'publicly traded' and
'headquarters operations' test.
Although lawyers and consultants continue to pore over the document, the
treaty will probably have few practical consequences for those companies
that have substantial business or administrative activities in either the US
or the Netherlands. The only drawback for them of the new treaty is that
they may face greater administrative burdens proving that they are eligible
to take advantage of the treaty's provisions.
However, two broad categories of companies are likely to be most affected by
the changed US-Dutch tax rules: companies which use Dutch companies as a
channel for investment into the US because their own countries, such as
those in the Middle East, have no tax treaty of their own with the US; and
UK companies which use a 'mixer' sub-holding in the Netherlands to blend
their tax liabilities in various countries before remitting profits to
Britain.
Particularly for companies in the 'mixer' category, minor or even wide-scale
restructuring of their corporate structure in the Netherlands may be
necessary if they are to continue to draw on the treaty.
If they lose their eligibility, companies will face an increase in US
withholding tax on dividends from 5 per cent to 30 per cent and on interest
payments from nil to 30 per cent.
In another change, the treaty will effectively force the Netherlands to
alter the ability of Dutch resident companies to use tax-haven companies and
branches in places like the Netherlands Antilles. The treaty stipulates that
if the Netherlands does not revise its laws on this point, the two countries
will handle the issue in a protocol to the treaty.
Despite the changes brought by the treaty, the Netherlands is expected to
remain an attractive tax regime for foreign companies, though competition
continues to increase within Europe, especially from the 'co-ordination
centre' facilities allowed by neighbouring Belgium.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (4): Guilder remains
resilient - Economic Outlook / The Netherlands has so far been able to avoid
the worst effects of recession in Germany, its biggest trading partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE positive result of last month's dramatic disintegration of the European
Monetary System - for the Netherlands, at any rate - is that it has
underlined the resilience and strength of the Dutch guilder.
Of all the EC currencies in the mechanism, only the guilder was able to hold
on to its 2.5 per cent band with the German mark. All the others retreated
to 15 per cent bands, effectively leaving only the guilder and the D-Mark to
carry on the old-style EMS.
In the short term, the decline in value of other European currencies will
put pressure on the Netherlands' export-led economy and its export-dependent
companies. But in the long term, the guilder's ability to maintain its link
to the D-Mark means the Netherlands can expect to reap the benefits of low
inflation.
Indeed, the outcome of the currency turmoil can be seen a back-handed
compliment to the Netherlands' unswerving commitment over the past 10 years
to pegging the guilder to the D-Mark. Over the years, this policy has often
encountered domestic criticism, particularly in times of rising interest
rates such as in the immediate aftermath of German reunification. But the
fall-out from the recent EMS crisis appears to have vindicated the 'strong
guilder' efforts of the past.
'I think people will now stop seeing the Dutch central bank as merely a
slave to the Bundesbank,' one bank economist says. 'It's clearly in our
interests to be linked to the D-Mark.
The Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, says it was partly this link
that enabled the country to get its structural, or underlying, inflation
rate down to around 3 per cent in the 1990s from an average of 6.6 per cent
in the 1960s and 1970s. The day after the EMS debacle, the Dutch finance
ministry also noted, 'the coupling of the guilder to the D-Mark has made a
strong contribution to the fact that the level of Dutch short and long-term
interest rates is among the lowest in Europe.'
Several times in 1993, the Dutch central bank was able to cut interest rates
independently of the Bundesbank. This demonstrated that, in many ways, the
Dutch economy is actually putting in a stronger performance than that of its
powerful eastern neighbour. For example, Dutch inflation is considerably
lower than that of Germany, as is growth in unit wage costs. Most
importantly, the Netherlands has not yet followed Germany into deep
recession, though Dutch growth rates are clearly faltering.
Growth in gross national product, which peaked at 4.7 per cent in 1989, fell
to just 1.4 per cent last year and could slow to 0.5 per cent or less in
1993, economists predict. Although consumer spending is holding up
relatively well, unemployment is rising quickly, in line with the trend in
other parts of Europe.
Opinions are divided on whether the Netherlands is already in a full-blown
recession. For this reason, some economists prefer to describe the situation
as one of 'recessionary growth' or even a 'velvet recession."
According to strict economic definitions, the country dipped into recession
in early 1993. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the economy contracted by 0.1
per cent compared with the third quarter, and this was followed by a further
0.4 per cent drop in the first three months of 1993. Nevertheless, the
figures are not entirely conclusive because the declines were so slight. At
the same time, provisional figures for the second-quarter gross domestic
product show that growth was flat in the spring, meaning that the recession
has bottomed out.
In any case, it is clear that, so far, the Netherlands has been able to
avoid the worst effects of recession in Germany, its biggest trading
partner, which is projected to suffer a 2 per cent decline in economic
growth this year.
Even though 30 per cent share of Dutch exports go to Germany, the pain of
German recession has been eased by the fact that the Netherlands' foreign
sales are heavily weighted in favour of less cyclical sectors such as
agriculture and energy. A quarter of Dutch goods sold in Germany are
foodstuffs or food-related. This was particularly beneficial in the early
days of German re-unification, when Dutch horticulturists moved quickly to
satisfy pent-up demand for fresh vegetables in the former East Germany.
Another reason why the Netherlands has been able to absorb Germany's
economic downturn is that wage rises were kept low throughout the 1980s and
are still well below Germany's increases, accounting partly for continued
Dutch competitiveness.
For this reason, industry's traditional calls for wage restraint have
intensified in the past few months, particularly since the breakdown down of
the EMS. If other European currencies drop sharply against the D-Mark and
the guilder, Dutch companies will inevitably be forced to choose between
reducing profit margins to retain their share of export markets or accepting
a loss of European market share to protect overall profitability.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (3): Concept fosters
cross-selling of financial services - Dutch financiers' enthusiasm for
'bancassurance' trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT home, Dutch financial institutions are fervent followers of the trend
towards 'bancassurance' - the combining of banking and insurance operations
in one financial services group in order to foster cross-selling of banking
and insurance products.
Now, having taken the 'bancassurance' concept further than most European
competitors, the Dutch are slowly branching out, with varying degrees of
success, into other parts of the continent and beyond.
The export of Dutch-style bancassurance marks the second phase of the
Netherlands' embrace of integrated financial services.
The first step came in 1990 when the government lifted an informal ban on
mergers between insurers and banks.
This freedom was quickly seized upon by several leading players to create
three main domestic bancassurance, or 'Allfinanz,' groups: Internationale
Nederlanden Group (ING); Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance
group; and Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank, and its insurance
subsidiary Interpolis.
Of the three, Rabobank is the only one which has yet to take its
bancassurance concept to other markets. In recent years it has concluded a
string of partnerships with banks in Spain, France, the UK, Italy, Germany
and Austria, but these ties are focused on traditional banking activities,
mainly helping each others' clients on their respective home markets.
The bank is planning to look into applying bancassurance to other markets
than the Netherlands, but no conclusions have yet been drawn.
ING - the product of a merger in 1991 between Nationale-Nederlanden, the
Netherlands' largest insurer, and NMB Postbank, the country's third-largest
bank - has so far managed to 'export' bancassurance to Italy, the first
country outside the Netherlands where it operates as a fully integrated
financial services company.
The vehicle for ING's bancassurance approach in Italy is Sviluppo, a
Milan-based financial group in which the Dutch company has gradually built
up a 100 per cent stake. Sviluppo, which was already active in areas like
securities brokerage and investment funds, mainly through its 650 financial
advisers, now also sells Nationale-Nederlanden life insurance and pension
products.
ING's hopes of creating a second 'home market' for bancassurance in Belgium
were dashed, at least for the time being, when it decided against launching
a bid for Bank Brussel Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second-largest bank, in late
1992.
BBL has since said it wants to develop bancassurance in co-operation with
two of its institutional shareholders, Royale Belge and Winterthur. ING,
which has a 10 per cent stake of its own in BBL, has not ruled out some sort
of pact with BBL in the future.
Meanwhile, ING continues to search for what it describes as a second 'home
market' in Europe. Elsewhere, it has opened an insurance desk at its Hong
Kong banking operation and it is looking at insurance and pension
opportunities in South America, where it has extensive banking operations.
Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, already
has two home markets, and it has applied bancassurance practices
successfully on both.
The Dutch-Belgian group's position in Belgium may soon be strengthened if it
succeeds in negotiating the takeover of a significant stake in the
government-owned Belgian savings bank group ASLK-CGER as part of the
country's privatisation programme.
ASLK-CGER, which already sells insurance products through its banking
network, has granted Fortis exclusive negotiating rights until October 15.
If no deal is reached, the Belgian bank may turn to another suitor, but both
sides have said they will do their best to reach an agreement.
By taking a large stake in ASLK-CGER, Fortis would not only be extending the
reach of its bancassurance operations in Belgium but it would also be
gaining a new distribution canal. AG, Fortis' Belgian shareholder, sells its
insurance policies mainly through independent agents rather than through
bank offices like ASLK-CGER.
Besides Belgium, Fortis has also made bancassurance inroads in Spain through
a joint venture with the country's largest savings bank, La Caixa. The 50-50
venture owns large stakes in the bank's life and non-life insurance
operations, making Spain the fourth most important market for Fortis after
the Netherlands, Belgium and the US.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (2): Market becomes
more aggressive - Merchant Bank Mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Netherlands' 'newest' merchant bank likes to see itself as continental
Europe's first 'Anglo-Saxon' merchant bank.
Mees Pierson, created in April out of the merger between two rival merchant
banks within the ABN Amro group, has set its sights on following in the
traditions of Goldman Sachs, Kleinwort Benson and Schroders while continuing
to draw on its roots in the continent of Europe.
From the moment they first announced their merger plans in November, former
competitors Bank Mees &amp; Hope and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson made clear that
they were modeling themselves on the big Anglo-Saxon players, all of whom
are active on the bank's open home market.
In fact, the Anglo-Saxon banks are probably Mees Pierson's biggest
competitors in the Netherlands after its own parent bank, ABN Amro.
Mr Johan Kleiterp, chairman, says Mees Pierson has the same expertise as its
Anglo-Saxon rivals and it even shares the same culture, reflecting a decade
of change to new market conditions and the adoption of a more aggressive
market stance - 'our corporate culture is not much different from that of
most of our Anglo-Saxon colleague houses,' he says.
'Perhaps we could raise our aggressiveness a bit,' Mr Kleiterp adds, but
stresses that the bank's two predecessors had already made great strides
forward in the 10 years before the link-up.
He notes that Mees Pierson does not have the same financial muscle as
Goldman Sachs in security trading, for instance, but adds, 'one of reasons
for the merger was to contribute to a substantial strengthening of our
financial base.'
Mees Pierson, with a balance sheet total of Fl 36bn, may be the newest name
in Dutch banking but it traces its history back to the early 1700s. Its
predecessor banks, buoyed by the Netherlands' status as a great trading
nation, helped finance the construction of Canada's railways, and they were
also involved in arranging the 'Louisiana Purchase' which allowed the
newly-formed United States to buy a great swath of territory from France.
Pierson was taken over by Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank (Amro) in 1975, the same
year that Amro's rival ABN purchased Mees &amp; Hope. However, both merchant
banks continued to operate independently of their new parents.
When Amro and ABN merged in 1990, speculation quickly started that one or
other of the merchant banks would be sold off.
In the event, the decision was taken late last year to merge them, while
retaining the policy of allowing the merged bank to compete head-on with its
parent in Mees Pierson's entire range of businesses - corporate finance,
primary markets, equity trading, asset management and lending.
Abroad, Mr Kleiterp is often called upon to explain how a subsidiary can
operate in total independence from its parent. Proof of this separateness
and independence, he says, is the fact that the bank has offices in many of
the same international financial centres as ABN Amro  - 'we both have
offices in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Why shouldn't we both be in
New York, Singapore or Hong Kong?' he asks.
Mees Pierson's network of 20 offices in 17 foreign countries is largely a
legacy of the international ambitions of Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson, rather
than of Mees &amp; Hope. This means that there is not much overlap overseas
compared with the Netherlands, where 450 out of 2,500 domestic jobs are to
go.
Mees Pierson employs a total of nearly 4,000 people, including 1,500
overseas, and it expects the foreign-domestic ratio to move closer to 1:1 as
the bank grows abroad. However, the number of foreign offices itself is not
expected to show significant expansion.
Mees and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson each had offices in London, New York,
Singapore and Hong Kong, and these will eventually be integrated. There is
no urgent need to do so, however, because Mees's emphasis lay more in
corporate, trade and commodity finance while Pierson tended to pursue asset
management, stockbroking and private banking in these centres.
A top priority for this year is to launch equity research and trading in
Frankfurt, to be followed by Paris. The strategy is to make equity research
and trading more European, and then, in their wake, to win more cross-border
business in mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance.
Before the merger, Pierson had attempted to boost its European profile in
equities through a partnership with Sal. Oppenheim of Germany. But the
merger, plus Oppenheim's own revised strategy, put an end to their
co-operation. Last year, the partners' jointly-owned venture in Paris,
Oppenheim Pierson Melendes, was closed down because of continued losses.
In asset management, Mees Pierson already has a large, global operation that
spans Europe, the Far East and the US.
Among the challenges of the merger is the need to integrate separate
automation systems. Credit and treasury systems will be fully integrated by
the start of 1994, but merging the two banks' equity systems will take well
into next year.
On matters of business philosophy, Mr Kleiterp says Mees Pierson has yet to
take a stance in principle on how it would respond if a client wanted to
launch an unfriendly, Anglo-Saxon-style takeover bid, a phenomenon which is
still exceedingly rare in the Netherlands but which is expected to increase.
Mr Kleiterp's old bank, Pierson, had been involved in isolated Dutch
battles, whereas Mees's former parent ABN had come out squarely against
participation in hostile bids.
He says Mees Pierson's stance could be - like Pierson's - that it would
defend any client that was on the receiving end of a bid and that it would
examine on a case-by-case basis the merits of any bid which a client would
want to launch - 'I wouldn't automatically say no (to involvement in an
unfriendly bid), but I would add that this is something we still need to
discuss as a matter of principle in the new combination,' he says.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (1): Facing up to
international competition - Every segment of the Netherlands' finance
industry is being penetrated by foreign competition. Amsterdam is having to
work much harder than its bigger rivals just to hold its own as a European
financial centre, reports Ronald van de Krol, who wrote this survey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER a spate of mergers in the Dutch banking and insurance sector in the
early 1990s, the whirlwind pace of change has slowed down sufficiently for
the Netherlands' financial community to take stock of its strengths and
weaknesses and to prepare for the future.
There is little doubt that the recent bout of consolidation has produced a
far stronger Dutch financial sector, particularly when judged by domestic
standards. But the problem is that the purely national market no longer
exists. Competition at home from foreign banks and insurance companies is
fierce, a legacy of the traditional openness of the Dutch market.
Increasingly, the challenge of 'international' competition is one which
Dutch banks and insurance companies are having to face - and win - on their
own turf as well as on other European markets.
The same is true of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The exchange, which lays
claim to being the world's oldest, can no longer afford to feel content with
the regular annual increases in turnover volume in Amsterdam, simply because
the rise in trading in Dutch shares and bonds in London is showing even
faster growth, as is the use of non-Dutch brokers.
In the past, before the advent of data transfer by telephone line and the
launch of screen trading in London, Amsterdam was, by rights and by
definition, the natural 'home' market for Dutch securities trading.
Now, however, the bourse finds itself forced to undertake a radical shake-up
of its trading system as part of a new effort to establish itself as the
main international marketplace for Dutch securities. With London continuing
to siphon off Amsterdam's business, the bourse's ability to protect this
basic function is by no means guaranteed, raising important questions about
the future role of the Dutch capital in a more highly integrated Europe.
Underlying the Amsterdam bourse's planned reforms is the recognition that it
must encourage foreign securities houses to take part in Amsterdam's
proposed new screen-based trading system even if they are physically based
in London. By trying to inject Anglo-Saxon standards of competition and
aggressiveness, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is, indirectly, challenging
Dutch-based banks and brokers to become much more daring themselves by
taking larger positions in equities trading and assuming greater risks.
THE future of Amsterdam as a financial centre lies in the hands of Dutch
institutions as much as it does in the intentions of London-based players.
The question is: how committed are Dutch banks and brokers to Amsterdam,
especially now that they too have built up stronger operations in London?
After all, technology means that they could as easily trade Dutch shares
from the British capital as they can from the Netherlands.
Still, there are obvious virtues in having conservative financial
institutions.
Neither Dutch banks nor Dutch insurers have run into the same types of
problems that have beset their colleagues in, for example, Scandinavia. And,
with the exception of the collapse of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch truck maker, and
a few other domestic cases, Dutch banks have so far not found themselves
overly exposed to the worsening economic climate in Europe. As a sector,
they have also tended to shun the cyclical property market.
This innate caution translates into admirable financial stability. Central
bank figures show that the average capital adequacy ratio of Dutch banks
stood at 11.5 per cent at the end of 1992, well above the Bank for
International Settlements' norm of 8 per cent.
When the banks are forced into disclosing their hidden reserves in the late
1990s, these figures, too, are expected to confirm the sector's overall
health.
Because they are big, strongly-capitalised and conservatively-managed, the
merged Dutch banks and the new hybrids - the 'bancassurance' groups spanning
both banking and insurance - can certainly afford further geographic
expansion. So far, however, growth abroad is still being hampered by the
lack of suitable takeover candidates at reasonable prices, especially in the
sector's 'home' market of Europe. ABN Amro, the Netherlands' biggest bank,
has found it easier to expand by acquisition in the Chicago area than closer
to home in Europe.
With the opening up of Europe and the emergence of bancassurance, Dutch
institutions are faced with many more opportunities - and dilemmas - than
before.
By comparison, the previous round of far-reaching consolidation in the
mid-1960s was relatively straight-forward, with separate mergers creating
big rival banks, ABN and Amro, and a large insurer, Nationale-Nederlanden.
Acquisitions by ABN and Amro in the mid-1970s produced the famous but now
defunct Dutch 'four-leaf clover' in which corporate finance was entirely
dominated by four home-grown players: ABN and its investment bank Mees &amp;
Hope, and Amro and its investment bank Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson. It was
natural for Dutch companies to go to their Dutch banks for finance, and
foreign competition was inconsequential.
All that has changed. Firstly, the main two petals of the four-leaf clover
fell away in 1990 with the link-up of ABN and AMRO, and this was followed up
in April by the coupling of their investment banks into Mees Pierson.
Secondly, the merger in 1991 of Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank, the
country's third-largest bank, created the Netherlands' biggest exponent of
'bancassurance,' or 'Allfinanz,' blurring previous distinctions between
banks and insurers. Rabobank, the co-operative bank, and Amev, the insurer,
have also embraced bancassurance, though ABN Amro and Aegon, the country's
other big insurer, have not.
Finally, foreign competition has penetrated every segment of Dutch finance,
from primary bond issues to lending. Anglo-Saxon banks, both those with
offices in the Netherlands and those which serve the Dutch market from
London, are particularly active.
The prevalence of foreign banks in the world of Dutch finance has been
heavily underscored by the upcoming partial flotation of the country's
postal and telecommunications company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland. As part of
the 1994 flotation, the biggest in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange's history,
the Dutch government has already appointed Britain's NM Rothschild &amp; Son to
act as its advisers. KPN, for its part, has chosen Goldman Sachs.
Unlike France, where the choice of foreign advisers would have raised
eyebrows, the selection has caused barely a murmur in the Netherlands.
The flotation of KPN marks probably the last big privatisation in a country
with few state-owned companies. In the long term, although the state-owned
railways may eventually become a candidate for sale, the Netherlands and its
financial community cannot rely on state sell-offs to swell the ranks of
bourse-listed companies. This stands in sharp contrast to France and
neighbouring Germany, where a long list of privatisation candidates offers a
guarantee of continuous organic growth of their respective capital markets.
In the end, the Netherlands simply lacks the large domestic hinterland that
has naturally propelled London, Frankfurt and Paris to the forefront of
European finance.
From this perspective, it is all the more impressive that Amsterdam has
managed to build up a role in European finance that is clearly out of all
proportion to the country's size. But the handicap of size also means that
Amsterdam will have to work much harder than its bigger rivals just to hold
its own in Europe.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Test for Bank and examiners: The appeal against closure of
Mount Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England faces one of the first real external tests of its
credibility as a regulator this week as a panel of three sits to assess
whether it was right almost a year ago to recommend closure of Mount
Banking.
The workings of the banking appeals tribunal - the panel before which the
Bank is appearing - are also being tested for the first time. No other
tribunal has been constituted in the six years since the legal provisions
for them were introduced.
The Bank of England faces an appeal brought by Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji
Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah, the shareholders in Mount Banking, a
small bank based in the UK.
Most of Mount's depositors were Asians. Accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick who
are the administrators to the bank are also involved in the appeal.
The Shahs object to the petition brought by the Bank in early October last
year to place Mount in provisional liquidation. This was granted, and Mount
entered administration two weeks later.
Creditors last month approved a voluntary arrangement which leaves open
several options for Mount's future.
The procedure for a banking appeals tribunal was established in the 1987
Banking Act, with the details laid out in a statutory instrument which
became effective in that year.
Although seven cases have gone as far as a preliminary hearing, none has yet
reached the stage of a full appeal. 'It is an ad hoc body,' an official
familiar with the tribunal said yesterday.
'It is so long since the previous one (appeal) that we are almost
re-inventing the wheel.'
Control for administering appeals has been shifted since 1987 from the
Treasury to the Lord Chancellor's Department, where it is co-ordinated by
the secretariat responsible for value added tax and inland revenue appeals.
The same staff would also handle appeal procedures laid down in legislation
for building societies and friendly societies, though no such action has
ever been launched in either case.
When any banking appeal is received, the lord chancellor nominates a
chairman and the chancellor of the exchequer puts forward two 'wing' members
 -so called because they sit on either side of the chairman.
The chairman holds a preliminary hearing and if there is a case to answer
and those involved wish to continue, a tribunal is held. Lawyers may
represent all those called and the verdicts and identities have normally
been kept secret.
In 1989-90 there were three initial appeals which were either withdrawn or
settled without recourse to the full tribunal. One of the cases is believed
to have concerned Harrods Bank.
In the past year there have been a further three appeals. One was settled by
agreement, one was withdrawn and a decision about whether to proceed to a
full appeal on the third is still pending.
In addition, there is the Mount case, for which the chairman is Mr Jonathan
Mance QC. The wing members are Mr Christopher Swinson, an accountant, and Mr
Nicholas Clegg, a banker. The hearings started on Monday and may run into
next week.
The Bank of England rejects suggestions that the tribunal reflects a greater
willingness to have its authority as a supervisor tested - an approach
recommended in the Bingham report following the collapse of Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
Others suggest that the fact a tribunal is taking place is more a function
of the tenaciousness of the Shahs and their insistence in pursuing the
formal procedures as far as possible.

FT  10 SEP 93 / US Ford plant may build new Jaguar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK workforce at Jaguar, Ford's luxury car division, will face
competition from at least one rival Ford plant in the US to build the new
'small' XJ200 saloon for launch in 1998, it was acknowledged yesterday.
Executives at Jaguar's Coventry headquarters said they still considered the
UK to be the most likely production centre. The new car is intended to be
built at a rate of up to 70,000 a year.
Jaguar said yesterday: 'We will have to go to the Ford board with a
recommendation as to where it should be built, based on tightly researched
comparisons between the West Midlands and possible US plants.'
A decision is still nearly 18 months away, but the centre of gravity of
Jaguar's sales this year has started moving strongly towards north America.
Jaguar expects the US to be by far its largest single market this year, and
to account for about 14,000 of a projected world total of 29,000 sales. That
is twice the likely sales level in the UK, Jaguar's next biggest market.
Performance in the US is being enhanced by an order worth Pounds 16m for 500
XJ6 saloons from the Budget car rental group. The order, announced
yesterday, gives Jaguar a foothold in North America's huge luxury car rental
market. The deal was described by Jaguar's North American president, Mr
Michael Dale, as 'a major breakthrough'.
The 36 per cent rise in US sales so far this year, coupled with an extended
summer shutdown while a new assembly line was commissioned, has left Jaguar
short of stock and has led to temporary overtime working.
Sales in the UK have also risen this year, by 16 per cent to 4,825 by the
end of August, but Jaguar has been unable to escape the effects of the steep
slump in the continental European car market.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Congress votes for electricians' return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC Congress voted by a comfortable majority for the return of the
electricians to the TUC as part of the AEEU engineering and electrical union
yesterday - but only after one of the most bitter debates seen in the trade
union movement for a long time.
Delegates voted by 4,303,000 to 2,837,000 for the TUC's peace formula, which
should return the electricians to the TUC from the end of this month.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said: 'I am pleased at the outcome. The vote
was for the future of trade unionism, but the sound and fury of the debate
put the ugly face of trade unionism before the public. We have to build
bridges to get over the disgraceful scenes seen at the rostrum.'
However, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, said he had no
regrets over his savage attack on the electricians, during which he tore up
a written guarantee from Mr Jordan that the AEEU would abide by the TUC
rules. 'We have been the victims of plundering and pilfering,' said Mr
Morris. 'What has been agreed today by Congress is a short-term fudge which
won't last. We will have the same drama next year.'
It took an effective and reasoned intervention by Mr John Monks, the new TUC
general secretary, to calm the atmosphere. 'I bet the government has loved
this,' he said.
But he later welcomed the decision to allow the return of the electricians.
'It was a good day for the TUC though deep scars remain and work has still
to be done,' he said. 'I did not like some of the things I saw but these
were done in the emotion of the moment.'
Mr Jordan said that the gesture by Mr Morris during the debate, in tearing
up a written guarantee promising not to poach members, 'showed a disregard
and contempt for the trade union movement. It gave the worst glimpse of
trade unionism the public has ever seen.'
Waving in the direction of the AEEU delegation Mr Morris declared: 'We stand
here as the victims and not the aggressors - they are over there. You can't
build unity on the basis of 'take it or leave it'.'
With the real threat that the AEEU would leave the TUC rather than accept
the continuing exclusion of the electricians, Mr Jordan said his union had
gone a long way to satisfy the demands of as many as 11 unions which lost
members to the electricians in the six years since the electricians'
expulsion from the TUC.
The savagery of the attacks on the electricians reflected the frustration
and anger among many union delegates, he said.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Chicken sexers revive a lost art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Social Fund is giving grants to train long-term unemployed men
and women in a lost art - sorting out the males from the females among
day-old chicks.
The skills are in such demand that 30 trainees on eight-month part-time
courses, have been offered salaries of Pounds 15,000 a year if they
successfully complete the training. An experienced sexer can earn up to
Pounds 40,000.
Qualities required for the job include concentration and the manual
dexterity to part the feathers of up to 1,200 chickens an hour. 'It is very
tiring,' said Mr Tom McGuckin, project manager. 'Many workers can only
manage a three-and-a-half-day week.'
Chickens need to be sexed so they can meet customer requirements - males for
fattening-up and females for laying eggs.
The skill of sexing has been in decline in Britain, and poultry breeders
have been hiring Japanese or Korean workers. 'Up to now there have been no
training facilities in the UK,' said Mr McGuckin.
Poultry breeders have tried to separate males and females by mechanical
means, but they are having to stop because of animal welfare laws.
Years ago, there was a four-year apprenticeship for the job. Eight months,
said Mr McGuckin, was not a long time in which to learn the job and be able
to perform it at speed.
'Chickens are not like human beings.' he said. 'There is no obvious way of
telling the sex of a chick at that age. It takes time to recognise the
differences.'
There were more jobs on offer than students, he said.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Jubilee Line extension looks set for go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE JUBILEE Line Underground extension to Canary Wharf in east London is
almost certain to go ahead, after months of negotiations between banks and
the government over the private sector's promised Pounds 400m contribution
to the project.
A banker to the project said that all material disagreements had been
resolved.
Eleven commercial banks led by Lloyds will today announce a financial
reconstruction of Canary Wharf, which has been in administration under
insolvency procedures for more than a year. The 11 lent Pounds 600m to fund
construction.
The rescue of Canary Wharf - which was built by Olympia &amp; York of Canada,
the world's biggest property developer until it collapsed last year - has
been dependent on an agreement being reached with the government on building
the Tube extension.
Banks have been prepared to inject new funds into Canary Wharf only if they
could be confident that the Jubilee extension would be built.
As part of the reconstruction Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants acting as
administrators to the project, are providing creditors with details of a
proposed settlement of claims. If creditors accept Canary Wharf will come
out of administration under a company voluntary arrangement. It would be the
first time that a big company emerged from administration as a going
concern.
The European Investment Bank, owned by the European Community, is providing
Pounds 98m so that the first two tranches of the private sector's
contribution can be made.
Plans for the Pounds 1.7bn London Crossrail east-west rail link have run
into a delay. London Underground confirmed last night that the first meeting
of the Crossrail Bill committee, scheduled for next month, had been
postponed.
The government is continuing its search for cuts in the cost of the scheme
and has 'asked for the delay so we can look at costs', London Underground
said.

TEACHING UNIONS at the TUC yesterday rejected the government's plans to
recruit non-graduate primary school teachers.
Mrs Marian Darke, president of the National Union of Teachers, said such
teachers were 'an insult to children. It's like saying a surgeon does not
need to study anatomy before performing heart bypass surgery'.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, wants to allow men and women over
the age of 25 with two A-levels to teach in primary schools after training
for a year. At present they are required to take a four-year course.

FT  10 SEP 93 / TUC plea to Labour body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC has complained to the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation
about the British government's new legislation permitting employers to deny
pay increases to any employees who refuse to sign personal contracts, thus
requiring them to give up their rights of union representation.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that this provision of
the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act was 'a clear violation of
the key ILO convention on the right to organise and collective bargaining'.
He acknowledged that the ILO lacked the legal powers to force the government
to amend the legislation, but said that the TUC should keep up the pressure
and expose how employment rights in Britain did not match up to
international labour standards.
In recent years the ILO has upheld TUC complaints and criticised the British
government for unilaterally abolishing the negotiating rights of the
teachers' unions and failing to put an end to the blacklisting of trade
unionists by employers.

FT  10 SEP 93 / BT offers 1.9% pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT YESTERDAY said it had made a 'final' pay offer of 1.9 per cent to 110,000
engineers and clerical workers.
The increase, backdated to July 1, would take a technical officer's maximum
pay from Pounds 17,770 to Pounds 18,108 and a clerical officer's maximum pay
from Pounds 13,840 to Pounds 14,103.
Mr Peter Archer, director of employee relations, said that the company
believed the offer was reasonable. 'Although 1992-93 was a relatively good
year, there is a continuing need for us to reduce costs in real terms and
not to mortgage our future by awarding unrealistic pay increases on rates
which are already high by comparison with our competitors,' he said.
The National Communication Union, the main BT union, said it would meet on
Monday to consider the offer.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Pits to close after low bid turnout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR mining companies have bid to operate just seven of the 19
pits put out to tender by British Coal following its decision that it could
no longer run them. As a result British Coal will prepare the 12 pits that
did not receive bids for closure.
The final tally of bids is even less than was expected earlier this week
when the deadline closed for the last tranche of five pits to be put out for
licensing. This is because RJB Mining has withdrawn a bid for Easington
colliery in County Durham after it failed to agree with British Coal who
should bear the costs of pumping water in the area.
Three of the 19 mines are the subject of tenders which involve the use of
surface assets only. The low number of bids is a blow for thousands of
miners who have been made redundant, and provides little comfort for the
government as it prepares for a new round of closures.
In all, there were 19 tenders for 11 collieries but three have since been
withdrawn.
The bids involving mining proposals were led by Edwards Energy, headed by Mr
Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, which submitted
five tenders, and RJB, which submitted four, not including Easington. Apart
from them, only two mining offers were received, both for the same pit,
Betws, in Wales.
In the final tranche of five pits only one, Coventry Colliery at Keresley,
attracted an offer which involved mining. Parkside, Sharlston, Shirebrook
and Taff Merthyr received no offers.
The withdrawal of RJB's bid for Easington will heighten concern about water
pumping in the Durham coalfield.
The National Rivers Authority this week named Easington as a mine whose
closure threatens to contaminate water supplies. British Coal said that
talks with the NRA would continue.
Redundant British Coal employees are satisfied with the career advice they
receive as part of their severance packages, a survey has found.
The study was conducted among 526 former British Coal employees recently
made redundant. Half those interviewed were already in employment or
self-employment, the majority finding a new job within six months. More than
half said the job shop and career centre run by British Coal Enterprises, a
British Coal subsidiary, contributed directly to their finding new
employment.

   THE BENEFITS of the non-fossil fuel obligation
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which requires electricity producers to buy a portion of their power from
such sources as nuclear and hydro-electric - should be extended to
clean-coal projects in order to generate market enthusiasm for new
coal-fired plant, Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, said
yesterday.
Mr Clarke said that the large role foreseen for coal in this week's World
Energy Council report on the future of energy supplies meant that greater
emphasis should be given to clean-coal technology.
The higher costs of the non-fossil fuel obligation are met by a 10 per cent
levy on electricity bills which produces about Pounds 1.3bn a year.
The WEC report said coal was among the world's most plentiful energy
resources, and that it would play an important role in long-term energy
supplies.
It estimated that future investment in world coal projects would account for
13 per cent of energy investment. This would secure a market share in excess
of 20 per cent.
Mr Clarke said commitments to build coal-fired power stations in the west
and in developing countries suggested that coal was seen as the fuel of the
future.
However, the proposed privatisation of British Coal would restrict its
ability to take an adequate part in developing long-term technologies.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Petrol stations in rural areas 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of rural petrol stations operated by large integrated oil companies
could close if competition from hypermarkets continues unabated, Sir John
Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said yesterday.
Sir John said in the company's annual energy review that competitive
pressures were undermining the 'old public services undertakings' by which
the big oil companies ensured countrywide access to fuel at uniform prices.
Sir John said that hyper-markets accounted for 16 per cent of national sales
of vehicle fuels. Their market share is growing rapidly because they can
take advantage of cheap supplies from surplus capacity in British
refineries.
Hypermarkets can also concentrate on a few sites where they can incorporate
the latest health, safety and environmental standards at relatively low
costs.
'There is a growing differential between low volumes and high unit costs of
rural sites and the converse for hyper-markets who operate only at prime
sites,' Sir John said.

FT  10 SEP 93 / DTI at odds with mergers body on Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at the Department of Trade and Industry appear to be in conflict
with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the best way to deal with
British Gas, company chiefs suggested yesterday.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said that the MMC's
recommendations in its recent report ran counter to submissions made to the
Commission by the DTI's oil and gas division. 'It goes against what they
said. That's how I read it,' he said, while announcing the company's
half-year results.
Last month, the MMC recommended that British Gas be broken up by 1997, and
that its monopoly of the tariff market for small consumers be removed over
the following five years. However, publication of the full MMC report
earlier this week revealed that the DTI placed top priority on removing the
tariff market monopoly rather than the case for breaking up British Gas.
In their submission to the MMC, DTI officials said that as a free market
developed and competitors made greater inroads, the question of whether
British Gas should be broken up 'seemed likely to assume a smaller
importance than during the transition to it'. The key point was to regulate
the market in a way which enabled competitors to enter on equal terms, they
said.
A break-up would also create difficulties, the officials told the MMC. It
would require 'a radical overhaul of the legislation', and would be a
'complex exercise with its own transitional uncertainties.' They said it
would end British Gas's ability to underpin the domestic gas market during
the transition phase, and would increase the market's dependence on new
mechanisms which could not be tested in advance.
Officials also appeared to support British Gas's contention that a break-up
would prevent it competing effectively abroad, where some of its best growth
prospects lie. They told the MMC that 'the successful pursuit of overseas
gas business in existing market conditions required significant players with
live experience in all main areas of the business. There might be a balance
to be weighed up between requirements for the home market and requirements
for success abroad'.
Officials concluded with a warning that some British Gas shareholders might
see a break-up of the company as a departure from the spirit of the 1986
privatisation prospectus.
The fact that the MMC ignored these cautions and put break-up at the top of
the list will pose a dilemma for trade ministers. One option is to reverse
the MMC's recommendations and deregulate the market first, leaving break-up
till later, if at all.
One point of agreement between the MMC and the DTI is that the simultaneous
de-regulation and break-up is impractical.
British Gas is hoping that ministers will make a decision before Christmas.
Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, said yesterday that he wanted to avoid
a prolonged period of uncertainty.
Mr Brown said that British Gas has not yet had any contact with the DTI
about the report. In the absence of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
secretary, who is recovering from a heart attack, the matter is being
handled by Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister.
The DTI is seeking comments by the end of October.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Coal pension fund may be split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is proposing to split British Coal's Pounds 13.5bn pension
assets into two separate funds for past and present employees as part of the
planned privatisation of the company.
Under proposals put forward for comment yesterday the Department of Trade
and Industry said that the needs of existing employees differed from those
of pensioners, and that the new funds should be structured accordingly.
A choice of arrangements was proposed for pensioners. They could have a
closed scheme in which the government would guarantee inflation-linked
pensions and ensure the scheme's solvency. The government would share in any
surpluses, however, and would be involved in investment decisions.
Alternatively the government would provide no guarantees, but members would
not have to share future valuation surpluses with it.
Two new pension schemes would be set up for existing employees, following
from present arrangements which have separate schemes for supervisory grades
and industrial employees.
Each scheme would be required by statute to provide the same package of
benefits as before. The new schemes would operate on an industry-wide basis.
Employees would be free to choose whether to join a scheme, take out a
personal pension or join another scheme operated by their new employer.
Only British Coal employees who were contributing members of the main
schemes up to privatisation would be able to join an industry-wide scheme.
Employers would be responsible for making good any deficits in these
schemes.
It would be up to employers to decide on the pension arrangements for people
joining the coal industry after privatisation.
Yesterday's proposals do not say how the present funds should be divided
between the new schemes.
The DTI said it would have to be satisfied that the interests of
beneficiaries, employers and the taxpayer were satisfied.
The proposals were welcomed by the trustees of the British Coal staff
superannuation scheme. They described it as 'a first step, representing very
substantial progress in meeting the concerns of our members'. much work
would be needed to reach agreement on the details, however.
The pension funds have 577,000 members, more than 95 per cent of them
current or deferred pensioners. In June there were only 29,000 contributing
employees.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Inquiry finds no direct racial bias in Bar exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into allegations of racial discrimination at the Bar's law school
has found no evidence of direct discrimination, says an interim report
published yesterday.
But the inquiry, chaired by Dame Jocelyn Barrow, did not rule out of the
possibility of indirect discrimination and of direct discrimination in some
individual cases.
It was set up earlier this year to find out why ethnic minority students
taking the Bar finals exam in 1992 had a failure rate nearly three times
that of white students.
In the 1991-92 academic year, 44.7 per cent of ethnic minority students
failed the exam compared with only 16 per cent of white students.
The results for this year showed an improvement, but ethnic minority
students' failure rate was still more than double that of white students.
Just 12 per cent of white students failed the exam in 1993 compared with 30
per cent of ethnic minority students.
Dame Jocelyn said that research was continuing and a review of 20 individual
cases was to be undertaken next month.
While poorer prior academic performance could account for part of the
disparity, a substantial difference still remained.
The committee had identified a number of problems relating to teaching
assessment, she said. Potential solutions included the introduction of a
double marking system and the appointment of external examiners.
The final report will be published in March.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Rural petrol stations 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of rural petrol stations operated by large integrated oil companies
such as Shell could close if competition from hypermarkets continues
unabated, Sir John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said
yesterday.
Sir John said in the company's annual energy review that competitive
pressures were undermining the 'old public services undertakings' by which
the big oil companies ensured countrywide access to fuel supplies at uniform
prices. He added that the undertakings were becoming 'an untenable
anachronism'.
Sir John said that hyper-markets account for 16 per cent of national sales
of vehicle fuels. Their market share is growing rapidly because they can
take advantage of the cheap supplies from surplus capacity in British
refineries.
Hypermarkets can also concentrate on a few sites where they can incorporate
the latest health, safety and environmental standards at relatively low
costs.
'There is a growing differential between low volumes and high unit costs of
rural sites and the converse for hyper-markets who operate only at prime
sites,' Sir John said.
'These differentials can no longer be accommodated . . . (and) they will
increasingly entail the reduction and concentration of oil company networks,
with consequent pressures on the availability or price of rural petrol
supplies.'
Sir John also warned that urban motorists should not assume that the trend
towards lower petrol prices would last. Financial strains on re-finers were
now 'acute' because of a 20 per cent surplus in capacity combined with the
cost of new environmental measures, many of which he believes are
'ill-considered'.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Heseltine plans to be back at his desk this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is set to return to work
at the end of this month after a rapid recovery from the heart attack he
suffered in Venice in June.
The return of Mr Heseltine, one of the cabinet's most forceful
communicators, will boost government hopes of political recovery this autumn
from the disasters of the past year.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will look to Mr Heseltine to carry the
government's message to the country in a way that few other ministers are
able to manage.
However, Mr Heseltine is expected to restrict himself to light duties for
some time, suggesting that he remains less than fully fit.
He has been sent important papers in the past few weeks, but is not
receiving the boxes of government papers which form a large part of the
ministerial workload.
Mr Heseltine is said to be listening carefully to medical advice on the
extent of his workload, and is likely to avoid highly stressful situations,
at least initially.
This means that he may decide not to deliver a platform address to the
Conservative party conference in Blackpool next month - an event which is
normally a conference highlight.
However, he is said to be keen to attend the conference, and he may decide
to address one or more smaller gatherings on the conference fringe.
Mr Heseltine will return to a busy departmental schedule, including the need
for decisions on coal privatisation and the terms of reference for a
forthcoming review of the nuclear power industry.
He will also have to decide whether to accept the recommendations of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the break-up of British Gas.
The department will also receive the results of its studies into the
elimination of red tape later this year, and Mr Heseltine will want to be
closely involved in the development of an omnibus deregulation bill for the
next parliament.
Mr Heseltine will also want to give a further impetus to the delayed
negotiations on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, in which he takes a keen interest.
He is said to be keen to get back to work, and determined to retake the
reins of at the Department of Trade and Industry as quickly as poss-ible.
Speculation that Mr Heseltine might be moved by Mr Major to replace Sir
Norman Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party, is said to be
unfounded.

THE Bank of England should be wary about taking on the operation of an

regulator, a study sponsored by the Corporation of London has concluded.
In the aftermath of the collapse of Taurus, the Stock Exchange settlement
system, the Bank has proposed a successor system, to be known as Crest,
which it said it or a commercial vendor might operate.
The report notes that in other centres, responsibility for equity settlement
tends to be shared between the stock exchange, banks and brokers.

The scheme, Diamond EuroPass, will entitle business travellers to five fully
flexible return business-class journeys to be made on any of its direct
international routes within three months of purchase.
The pass will be priced in two bands: Pounds 799 covering travel between
London Heathrow and Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Dublin; and Pounds 999
for travel on any route on the airline's international network. It will be
available from September 13 in the UK and the end of the month overseas.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Decision on Hurd's Maastricht 'treason' hangs with CPS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS, as Hexham magistrate Mrs Muriel Bowman observed, 'a procedure we
rarely see'.
Normally, at 9.30 am on Thursdays, the magistrates court in the
Northumberland market town hears nothing more momentous than applications
for drinks licences.
However, yesterday's business was special - a last-ditch attempt to throttle
the Maastricht treaty by laying seven charges of treason against the
ministers who signed it: Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and the
former Treasury minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death
penalty under UK law.
The men behind the move, businessman and Conservative political economist Mr
Rodney Atkinson - older brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Freedom
Association chairman Mr Norris McWhirter, earnestly addressed Mrs Bowman.
The massed media - the people of Hexham being conspicuously absent - sat
entranced.
The statutes they handed over were impressive, from the Coronation Oath Act
of 1953 and the 1795 Treason Act to the Magna Carta. Mr Atkinson submitted
that the signing of the Maastricht treaty was contrary to laws and statutes
of the United Kingdom going back over many centuries.
Mrs Bowman played it with a straight bat. She passed it on to the Crown
Prosecution Service.
After the three-minute hearing Mr Atkinson insisted the challenge was
serious. 'My brother is in the business of comedy, I'm afraid on this
occasion I'm in the business of tragedy, a democratic tragedy for the
British people unless this Maastricht treaty is overturned.'
Mr McWhirter threatened a judicial review if the CPS does not act. But did
they really want to see Mr Hurd in the Tower of London? 'The Queen can
always exercise the prerogative of mercy, provided of course by that time
she's not Mrs Elizabeth Windsor, European citizen,' suggested Mr McWhirter.
If their main target was worried, there was no sign of it; he was 300 miles
away at a Downing Street cabinet meeting and was not represented in court.
It was all very civil but then Hexham, chosen for its nearness to Mr
Atkinson's family home and distance from the London political establishment,
has been pretty quiet for the last few centuries since the border wars
between England and Scotland calmed down.
The demonstrators, flanked by banners - 'Hang Hurd High', 'Rodney is Right'
 -were undeterred. Should Mr Hurd hang? 'Yes, absolutely,' said one. 'It's
no more than the government deserves.'

FT  10 SEP 93 / Maxwell administrators sue bank for Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to the manager of the Maxwell company pension funds have
filed a writ seeking Pounds 100m from Lehman Brothers International, the US
investment bank owned by American Express.
The writ alleges that officials of Lehman Brothers International entered
into 'stock-lending' agreements in which Bishopsgate Investment Management,
the Maxwell-owned fund management company, borrowed increasing amounts of US
Treasury bills, and that it knew the deals were unusual.
It alleges that as early as October 1990 Mr Mark Haas, Lehman's head of
international stock-lending, knew that stocks being offered as collateral
for the borrowings of US Treasury securities actually belonged to the
pension funds.
The writ details a conversation between Mr Haas and Mr Timothy Daily, then
head of stock-lending at Invesco MIM, the fund managers. Mr Daily was
questioning why the Maxwell pension fund investment portfolio managed by
Invesco had been passed to Lehman Brothers.
The writ alleges that Mr Haas informed Mr Daily that the stock-lending
arrangements were not normal; that the Treasury bills being lent to BIM were
being converted to cash; and that the late Robert Maxwell was in financial
difficulties.
Lehman rejected the claim, adding: 'We engaged in bona fide business
transactions under a legitimate stock-loan arrangement with a regulated
counter-party, and had no notice of any impropriety.'
The writ alleges that while Lehman was receiving press materials and private
information suggesting that Maxwell's personal empire was under pressure, it
agreed to increase borrowings to BIM in exchange for larger amounts of
collateral.
Once, it says, the bank agreed to an increase in credit facilities only
after BIM agreed that Lehman could be lead underwriter in a secondary
offering of BIM's stake in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceuticals company.
Last month Lehman acted as lead underwriter for an offering of the shares
still held by BIM as well as the shares it acquired under the stock-lending
agreement. The prospectus for the offering notes that the Teva shares held
as collateral were registered in the name of BIM and that permission had to
be obtained from Teva after Maxwell's death to change the registration to
its own name.
The borrowed Treasury bills, the writs allege, were on numerous occasions
sold back to Lehman Brothers Government Securities and then resold for cash.
The writ alleges that the cash was then deposited, upon the instructions of
a man who Lehman Brothers knew was not a director of BIM, into accounts for
the personal interests of Maxwell.
The writ says that Lehman usually took instructions from Mr Larry
Trachtenberg, a director of London and Bishopsgate International Investment.
BIM is not legally connected to LBII and Lehman had received on several
occasions lists of BIM directors, copies of its accounts and other
documents.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Right backs off from a fight: How the Tory top brass is
calling the tax tune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION yesterday by the cabinet's rightwing minority to drop a
threatened revolt on taxation marks the beginning of a determined effort by
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the drift and disunity of the past
year.
The climb-down underlined the weak position of the right wing in cabinet. It
also highlighted the ability of the prime minister and Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, backed by the loyal ranks of the spending ministers, to
exert control if they wish.
For this purpose, the cabinet right means Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary,
Mr Peter Lilley, health secretary, and, less committed, Mr Michael Howard,
home secretary - the trio generally identified as the 'bastards' referred to
in unguarded comments by Mr Major earlier this year.
However, while the issue is probably dead at cabinet level, continued unease
among rightwing backbenchers suggests that it remains a potentially
important focal point for dissent.
Rightwingers were dismayed by Mr Clarke's comments which kept open the
option of tax increases in the November Budget while ruling out any further
cuts in public spending.
One of Mr Major's strongest critics on the back benches is Mrs Teresa
Gorman, who has said that an increase in taxes would be 'a reversal of
everything we have stood for over the past decade or more'.
Others on the right wing making similar comments included Mr John Townend,
chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, and Sir George
Gardiner, a member of the executive of the 1922 Committee, which represents
all Tory backbenchers.
However, while taxation will continue to irritate relations between Mr Major
and the right wing, the debate is not simply a continuation of the
Maastricht rebellion by other means.
For one thing, there is little overlap between the the small group of
rightwingers which has orchestrated the debate on taxation and the 23
hard-line Euro-sceptics who helped defeat the government in the social
chapter debate in July.
Of the half-dozen leading backbench taxation rebels, only Sir George
Gardiner and Mrs Gorman were among the die-hard 23. The others - Mr Townend,
Mr David Shaw and Sir Rhodes Boyson - voted with the government.
Most of the remaining Maastricht rebels have yet to declare their views on
the Budget options. But there is no reason to assume that all would join a
taxation rebellion.
Some, like Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Richard Shepherd and Mr Nicholas Winterton -
who fell into line at the last minute on Maastricht - have virtually
detached themselves from the parliamentary party and are capable of opposing
almost any government policy.
Others, however, have been more discriminating in their criticism of the
government. For example, Mr Bill Cash, leader of the Maastricht rebellion,
has been loyal to the government except on Europe and pit closures.
Further complicating the picture, the right wing is split internally about
the balance of importance between low taxation and sound public finances,
which might require tax increases.
Some rightwingers point to Lord Howe's tax-raising budget of 1981, which
laid the groundwork for the prosperity of the later 1980s, as a courageous
Conservative Budget which the chancellor would do well to study.
Mr John Biffen, a former leader of the Commons under Lady Thatcher and the
leading rightwing proponent of this view, has suggested that the top rate of
tax may have to rise considerably to help eliminate the Pounds 50bn budget
deficit.
Mr Biffen was a trenchant critic of the Maastricht bill, although he voted
with the government in the final series of debates which eventually decided
the issue.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been more
opaque. He would like to avoid tax increases but, like Mr Biffen, he
believes that the first priority is sound public finances.
There is one further important difference between the Maastricht rebellion
and the taxation debate.
The Maastricht rebels' objective was to force the government to abandon the
treaty by forcing a vote on including the social chapter - anathema to
Conservatives. Throughout the long wrangle on the bill to approve the
treaty, the rebels knew that there was no risk of bringing down the
government. So when Mr Major called their bluff by tabling a confidence
motion, they fell into line.
However, the Budget is a different matter. The right wing's only chance to
reverse tax increases would be to oppose the enabling legislation in the
finance bill.
That would mean defeating the government on a key issue of policy, and
possibly wrecking the chancellor's spending and revenue calculations.
At this stage it seems highly unlikely that a significant number of rebels
would be prepared to go to such lengths to make their point.

government to abandon or modify much of the controversial Sheehy report and
finance a Pounds 20m redundancy scheme in his force instead.
The commissioner's formal response to the Sheehy report on police pay and
responsibilities, presented to the Home Office yesterday, rejects proposals
for fixed-term contracts for junior ranks; raising the retirement age for
constables and sergeants from 55 to 60; increasing the qualifying period for
full pensions; abolishing some ranks, and reducing starting pay.
Mr Condon also rejects Sheehy's proposals for performance-related pay but he
has offered to pilot-test Metropolitan Police proposals for a simplified
system linking pay to individual performance.
In a second move yesterday, Mr Condon announced proposals to reduce the
senior ranks of the Metropolitan force by 450 - nearly 20 per cent of the
total - by April 1995. He has asked the Home Office to finance the Pounds
20m scheme, which would otherwise have to be funded from reductions in
operational services. The redundancy programme requires the approval of Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary. It would be difficult for him to reject it
as thinning senior ranks is one of the objectives of the government's police
reforms. Mr Condon believes that the scheme would be quicker and cheaper
than some of the Sheehy proposals.
Under the redundancy plan the Metropolitan force would lose 260 inspectors
and chief inspectors, 190 superintendents and chief superintendents and 14
posts in assistant constable grades. A chief superintendent with 30 years
service retiring at 50 instead of 55 could receive up to Pounds 70,000. The
scheme could begin this autumn. 'I have never hidden the fact that we must
have fewer managers in the police service,' said Mr Condon. He did not
oppose change, but the Sheehy recipe for performance-related pay would be a
'bureaucratic nightmare', while its recommendations for lower starting
salaries and raising the retirement age were fundamentally wrong.
Mr Condon was sharply critical of Sheehy committee member Prof Eric Caines,
who has argued robustly for its proposals. 'My fear is that at least one
member of the committee had a fairly jaundiced view of what policing is all
about and what we are trying to achieve.'
The home secretary is consulting on the report until the end of this month.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Lloyd's to raise board payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to spend nearly Pounds 500,000 on extra payments to 26
business executives who sit on its market and regulatory boards as part of
efforts to improve the standard of management at the insurance market.
Among those benefiting are Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, Mr David
Newbigging, chairman of Rentokil, the environment and property services
group, and several leading Lloyd's underwriters.
The 26 members of Lloyd's market and regulatory boards will receive Pounds
20,000 a year, while 15 of these executives who are also part of the
20-strong Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - will also receive
an extra Pounds 5,000 per year.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said the changes were necessary to
'make sure we can get quality people'. He said that including regular
fortnightly meetings and background reading, board members could expect to
spend between 10 and 12 hours a week on Lloyd's matters.
Both boards were set up last year after a report by Sir Jeremy Morse into
the market's governance. Previously, seven members of the market's council
nominated by the Bank of England were paid Pounds 15,000 a year, while eight
external members, elected by Names, were simply reimbursed expenses.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, Mr Middleton and other employees of the Lloyd's
Corporation receive no extra payment.
Meanwhile Lloyd's announced that Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities
and Investments Board, had resigned from the council and the regulatory
board on because his commitments as chairman of the SIB did not allow him
sufficient time to devote to Lloyd's.
He will be replaced by Mr Robert Owen, deputy chairman of European Capital
Co and a former chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong
Kong.
Mr Large's departure came two days after that of the former deputy chairman,
Mr Stephen Merrett. Mr Rowland said that he recognised the 'very
considerable demands made upon (Mr Large's) time as chairman of the SIB'.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Sales rise but shops peg prices, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL sales rose again last month, but shop managers still lack the
confidence to put up prices, a Confederation of British Industry survey
showed yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of the CBI's quarterly distributive trades survey, Mr
Nigel Whittaker, distributive trades panel chairman, warned that tax
increases in the November Budget could damage the 'modest recovery in high
street activity'.
The CBI said the increase in sales in August, following similar improvements
in June and July, was accompanied by the lowest year-on-year rise in shop
prices in the 10 years since the survey was first conducted.
Mr Whittaker added: 'Part of the growth in high street business may have
been achieved by retailers setting low prices to win business in competitive
market conditions.'
While the improvement in retail sales appears to be well-established, the
pace of the upturn is uneven.
The survey showed a patchy recovery across sectors. Some traders reported
small sales rises and, in general, retailers with just one store had trade
volumes below last year's levels. Motor traders had their best August for
five years.
The outlook for wholesalers was unpromising. They reported a slowdown in
activity since spring and expect sales growth over the next three months to
fall further.
The strongest improvements were in clothing, furniture and carpet shops.
Sales for grocers, shoe shops and chemists were also buoyant.
A balance of 31 per cent of retailers reported increased sales in the year
to August, compared with 32 and 30 per cent in July and June.

FT  10 SEP 93 / League table for Names' agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP DIFFERENCES in the performances of members' agencies at the Lloyd's
insurance market are disclosed in a survey published yesterday by the
Association of Lloyd's Members, the organisation which represents more than
9,000 Names. Members agents handle the affairs of Names whose assets support
Lloyd's.
Two small agencies - Hardy and Gravett &amp; Tilling - come top of the ALM
league table, producing average pre-tax profits (before Lloyd's and agency
charges) of 9.8 per cent and 8 per cent (of gross capacity or allowable
premium income) respectively in the five years 1986 to 1990.
The best performing larger agencies were Kiln, Roberts &amp; Hiscox and Murray
Lawrence, which produced average returns for Names of 5.2 per cent, 4.8 per
cent and 4.4 per cent in the same five years.
Some 65 agencies are currently active in the Lloyd's market compared to 250
in 1984.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Staff vetting may use criminal records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW basis for the use of criminal records as a way to vet employees is
suggested by the government in a consultation paper published yesterday.
While the idea of creating an independent agency to administer vetting
arrangements appears likely to win support, the suggestion that it might be
privatised will prove more controversial.
The paper also proposes legislation to allow the police to charge for making
checks on prospective employees' criminal records, and puts forward new
criteria for vetting checks.
These include extending existing rules to protect the vulnerable, such as
children and the elderly, from rogue applicants for posts in childrens'
homes, sheltered accomodation and other social services and charitable work.
Under the proposals the arrangements for giving information on local police
records could be tightened to define more closely both the matters that can
be disclosed and the posts for which such checks could be made.
A full charge for vetting is estimated to be about Pounds 12 for a check of
national records, while a check of local records as well would cost about
Pounds 17. The police currently carry out about 900,000 checks a year, some
two thirds of which are for child-protection.
The paper acknowledges that when MPs recommended the creation of an
independent agency they envisaged that it would be in the public sector, but
argues that there is no reason why the private sector should not run the
service.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Clarke pledges review of industry funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, last night announced a review of the role
of financial institutions in funding industry, in particular small
businesses.
The review, to be carried out by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to
the Treasury, will focus on whether business has access to the funds it
needs.
The chancellor told the annual dinner of the Confederation of British
Industry in Glasgow that he was concerned to ensure that the City and other
financial institutions contributed fully to the development of commerce and
industry.
It reflects Mr Clarke's desire, set out in his Mansion House speech in June,
to listen more to the concerns of business.
The chancellor also announced measures to push forward the government's
private finance initiative, launched last year to attract private capital
for public-sector projects. A task force representing the public and private
sector is to be formed to identify suitable projects and willing investors.
The initiative has attracted criticism - particularly from the CBI - for the
lack of progress since it was announced in the Autumn Statement. Many
companies are reluctant to commit resources to devising schemes to build new
infrastructure since they might not win a contract when it goes out to
tender.
Mr Clarke said that he would bring forward proposals to deal with the
problem of the intellectual property rights of such companies. And he
promised more guidance for businesses that want to invest in the public
sector.
Welcoming the measures, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI,
called on the chancellor to deliver a Budget in November that would
encourage investment in both the public and private sector.
Mr Nelson's review of funding for industry will aim to identify 'whether
there are any market imperfections which may distort the flows of finance',
according to the chancellor.
Among the issues to be reviewed will be the reliance of small and
medium-sized companies on bank overdrafts which provide less flexibility
than types of finance available to businesses in other European countries.
Mr Nelson will also listen to complaints of 'short-termism' among
institutional investors, which refuse to adopt a long-term perspective in
funding growing businesses.
He will be keen to establish whether the market is failing to provide
finance to businesses with good investment potential.
The economic secretary is not expected to produce a report at the end of the
exercise, the Treasury said last night. However, it said that if problems
are identified, the government will take action to rectify them.

Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat Citizen's Charter spokesman, said
the paper, to be discussed at the party's conference next month, would

FT  10 SEP 93 / Many killed in US attack on Somalis: UN says action was last
ditch effort to save troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US HELICOPTER gunships fired on a crowd of Somalis in Mogadishu yesterday,
inflicting heavy casualties in what United Nations officials said was a
'last ditch, last resort effort' to save encircled UN troops.
The battle followed an attack on a road-clearing patrol of Pakistani troops
under UN command, in which a UN armoured vehicle was set on fire by a 106mm
canon shell.
UN officials said there were 'sizeable' casualties among the Somali
militiamen who attacked the patrol. They said it was 'entirely possible'
that women and children who had swarmed around the armoured vehicles,
serving as cover to the militiamen, had been killed as well.
One Pakistani soldier was killed and five Pakistanis and three US soldiers
wounded in the battle, which took place in the same district of Mogadishu in
which seven Nigerian soldiers were killed by militiamen on Sunday, and 24
Pakistanis in an earlier ambush.
The battle took place as pressure mounted in Congress for President Bill
Clinton to pull US troops out of Somalia, or at least to lay down more
clearly what their purpose was.
The Senate yesterday debated a motion by Senator Robert Byrd, the senior
Democrat from West Virginia, urging that funds for the Somalia operation be
cut off on October 31 unless Congress approved US involvement.
'How long are we to chase around the Somali capital with helicopter raids,
seeking an elusive magic bullet solution to Somalia's political turmoil?' Mr
Byrd asked.
Members of Congress from various points on the political spectrum have
expressed mounting anxiety about different aspects of the US involvement,
ranging from the cost of the operation, to the president's failure to
consult Congress, to the UN command structure which places some US troops
under commanders of other nationalities.
'It is one thing to be there feeding people, but if you are out on an active
military mission I think Congress should sign off on it,' said Senator Mitch
McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky.
While US military forces have been greatly scaled back since the beginning
of the operation launched by former President George Bush, some 4,500 troops
remain, and have recently been reinforced by crack Army Rangers.
General Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday
said it would be a mistake to 'cut and run because things have gotten a
little tough,' and said withdrawal would be 'devastating to our hopes for
the new world order and our ability to participate in multinational
organisations to deal with problems like this.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESERVE Bank of India, the central bank, yesterday warned the government
in New Delhi that it is in danger of overshooting the borrowing targets set
in its wide-ranging economic reform programme.
In its 1992-93 annual report, published yesterday, the bank said government
borrowing in July, the latest period for which figures are available, was
running at Rs174bn (Pounds 3.6bn) - more than twice the level for the
equivalent month in 1992 and more than three times the level at the end of
the last financial year in March.
The reserve bank's warning comes amid signs that the government is under
political pressure to boost spending on subsidies and other handouts, in
advance of crucial state elections to be held in November.
Elections are due in four states where the local assemblies, dominated by
the opposition right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, were suspended after
the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque by BJP supporters. The ruling Congress (I)
Party is anxious to avert the danger of the BJP returning to power with
increased majorities.
The reserve bank report was generally optimistic about India's economic
prospects citing good growth and low inflation. But it expressed 'concern'
at the rise in government borrowing. Separately, in an interview, Mr C
Rangarajan, the central bank governor, said: 'We have expressed serious
concern to the government at the high level of net credit to the government
 .we feel that it is now running at a level far above what we regard as a
desirable level.
He said that ministers had to cut spending or raise revenues.
India is finding it difficult to cut government borrowing in line with
targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund, which is monitoring its
economy.
In 1991-92, the first year of reform, the gross fiscal deficit dropped from
8.4 per cent to 6 per cent of GDP. But in the year to March 1993, the
deficit fell only marginally to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
For the current year it is running at a similar level, far above the target
of 4.7 per cent. Indian officials could face questions about these
developments at the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF later this
month in Washington.
Finance ministry officials say the problem is caused partly by a fall in
customs revenue due to the slowdown in imports and partly by more spending.
Officials also argue that since India's inflation rate is low, delays in
cutting the fiscal deficit are not critical.

Plans for greater central bank independence were announced recently in the
economic reform programme of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister.
He is due to leave office after elections on October 6.
The proposals under consideration include allowing the State Bank of
Pakistan to recruit its own staff members without seeking clearance from the
federal government in Islamabad, new powers to control the money supply and
independence in regulating the activities of commercial banks.

Negotiations to resolve suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme
reached an apparent impasse yesterday after Pyongyang rejected talks on the
issue with Seoul, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea said it would not hold discussions with South Korea until Seoul
accepted conditions it has already rejected.
The demands from Pyongyang include Seoul ending military exercises with the
US. It also says it wants South Korea to stop seeking international
co-operation on the nuclear issue, apparently to isolate Seoul from US
support.
Seoul wants to conduct mutual nuclear inspections, which the two Koreas
agreed to conduct when they signed a non-nuclear pact in late 1991.

China and Britain closed their 11th round of talks on Hong Kong political
reforms yesterday agreeing to meet again in two weeks as they strive to
resolve a bitter dispute over democratic change, reports Reuter in Beijing.
The official Xinhua news agency said the next round of talks would take
place in Beijing from September 26-27, close to the time when the two
countries' foreign ministers are expected to meet at the United Nations
General Assembly in New York.
The talks, which have dragged on since April, are aimed at working out
differences over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's plans to implement
limited democratic reforms in the British colony before handing it back to
Beijing in 1997.
The Patten proposal has enraged Beijing, and the talks have struggled along
for months with no apparant sign of progress.

Pakistan's central bank is expected to be given more independence on
monetary and administrative policies in a presidential ordinance due next
week, senior officials said yesterday, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi.
Plans for greater central bank independence were announced recently in the
economic reform programme of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister.
He is due to leave office after elections on October 6.
The proposals under consideration include allowing the State Bank of
Pakistan to recruit its own staff members without seeking clearance from the
federal government in Islamabad, new powers to control the money supply and
independence in regulating the activities of commercial banks.
The new measures are meant to control the chronic problem of a large
budgetary deficit, caused by several years of uncontrolled government
spending.
The new ordinance is expected to allow the central bank to clearly set the
limits for deficit financing without government interference, Mr Mohammad
Yaqub, the bank governor said this week.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Japanese cut costs of labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic downturn has forced 60 per cent of Japanese companies to trim
employment costs, according to a labour ministry survey, writes William
Dawkins.
Cars and steel were among the six out of eight sectors surveyed which told
the ministry they had less work in late August than earlier in the summer.
This bodes ill for the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business
confidence, considered the most important indicator of corporate intentions,
due out today.
Companies' methods of cutting labour costs included staff relocation,
practised by 21.6 per cent of the 1,000 companies surveyed; lending
employees to other companies, practised by 11.4 per cent; and temporary
lay-offs, in the case of 7.6 per cent. A small proportion, 1.5 per cent,
have dismissed people or made early retirements.
So far, Japanese industry has avoided big redundancies, so that unemployment
has been contained at 2.5 per cent, according to official figures. Ministry
officials believe widespread redundancies are unlikely because companies
fear being short of workers when an upturn materialises.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Japan's parties see donations fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE political parties said they raised Y173.9bn (Pounds 1.08bn) last
year, but this is believed to be only a fraction of their real wealth,
writes William Dawkins.
The figure, in a home affairs ministry annual survey, is about a third of
the actual amount raised, estimated Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet
secretary and government spokesman.
It does not cover illicit funding, which the new government of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa has pledged to attack with strict controls on party financing, to
be tabled before the end of the year. Also, political parties are obliged to
disclose only the source of donations worth more than Y1m.
The figure last year represented a 6.3 per cent fall from the record
Y185.7bn in 1991, and the first fall for five years.
This is in part a reflection of the impact of the economic slowdown on
corporate donors' generosity and in part the fact that there was only one
election last year, for the upper house of parliament, after several years
of much political activity. Nearly half of the total is due to donations,
the rest from parties' own fund-raising activities, such as tickets for
lavish receptions, subscriptions to party publications or membership fees.
Mr Hosokawa's own Japan New Party, founded in May 1992, put in a spirited
start on the fund-raising trail by raising Y609m in the same year. The seven
coalition members raised Y84.9bn, said the report.
Each coalition members' fund raising power pales beside that of the
Communist party, which told the ministry that it raised Y33.6bn last year.
That is compared with Y25.5bn raised last year by the LDP, the former
government party and many times larger than the Communists.
The Communists' income is unusually high because it includes earnings from
its popular newspaper, Akahata (Red Flag). The LDP figure is deceptively low
because it does not include funds raised by the party's factions.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Clinton set to revive
dialogue with PLO - US president hails recognition deal achieved yesterday
in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday hailed the Middle East peace deal as 'a
huge development' and was expected today to announce that the US would
resume a dialogue with the PLO because of its agreement to recognise Israel.
Administration officials predicted that the PLO statement of recognition -
signed in Tunis last night - would meet US conditions for resuming talks
with the PLO, with which the US has had no contact since 1990.
Mr Clinton cancelled until today a statement planned for last night because
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, had not yet signed a document
recognising the PLO. But earlier yesterday Mr Clinton said in Cleveland: 'If
the PLO statement meets the criteria we have repeatedly set down -
renouncing terrorism and acknowledging Israel's right to exist - then we
will resume our dialogue with them, and we'll go forward from there.'
Mr Clinton applauded the 'very brave and courageous' decision of mutual
recognition by the PLO and Israel.
The president was 'very, very hopeful about the future', adding: 'I am
extremely happy that this finally happened. This is a huge development.'
Among other reaction, France hailed the breakthrough and pledged the
European Community would give political and economic support to Arab-Israeli
peace.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said: 'French diplomacy is determined to
support their efforts to build this just, global and lasting peace for which
we have long wished.'
He said he would seek to enlist EC foreign ministers' backing at an informal
meeting in Belgium tomorrow.
Egypt's foreign minister Amr Moussa described the initiative as 'a positive
step in a long journey to reach a settlement to the Palestinian and
Arab-Israeli conflict'.
Lebanese foreign minister Faris Bweiz described the peace moves as the 'most
important event since the fall of the Ottoman Empire' early this century.
In Washington Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, urged Israel
to prove peace was real by lifting a six-month-old closure of the West Bank
and Gaza, releasing prisoners and allowing home all those deported during
the 26 years of Israeli administration of the occupied territories.
PLO supporters in the territories generally welcomed the accord. But Islamic
fundamentalist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad joined Damascus-based
Palestinian radicals in a call to sabotage the agreement which they see as a
sell-out of Palestinians' claim to all of pre-1948 Palestine.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Letters of
recognition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following is the text of three letters, released in Jerusalem late last
night, which form the mutual recognition agreement between the PLO and
Israel. The letters are separate from the Declaration of Principles between
Israel and the PLO providing for Palestinian self-rule which is to be signed
in Washington on Monday:
From Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, to Mr
Yitzhak Rabin:
Mr Prime Minister,
The signing of the Declaration of Principles marks a new era in the history
of the Middle East. In firm conviction thereof I would like to confirm the
following PLO commitments:
The PLO recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and
security. The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242
and 338.
The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process, and to a peaceful
resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all
outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through
negotiations.
The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration of Principles
constitutes an historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful
co-existence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and
stability. Accordingly, the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other
acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and
personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent violations and
discipline violators.
In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the Declaration of
Principles and based on Palestinian acceptance of Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338, the PLO affirms that those articles of the
Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist and the
provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of
this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO
undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval
the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant.
Sincerely,
Yassir Arafat, chairman, Palestine Liberation Organisation.
From Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat:
Mr Chairman,
In response to your letter of September 9th 1993 I wish to confirm to you
that, in light of the PLO commitments included in your letter, the
government of Israel has decided to recognise the PLO as the representative
of the Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO within the
Middle East peace process.
Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel.
From Mr Arafat to Mr Johan Joergen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister:
I would like to confirm to you that, upon signing of the Declaration of
Principles, I will include the following positions in my public statements:
In light of the new era marked by the signing of the Declaration of
Principles, the PLO encourages and calls upon the Palestinian people in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the
normalisation of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, contributing to
peace and stability and participating actively in the shaping of
reconstruction, economic development and co-operation.
Sincerely,
Yassir Arafat, Chairman, Palestine Liberation Organisation.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Aid needed at a
proper pace

PENS are set to be uncapped for the signature by Israel and the Palestinians
of an outline agreement on self-rule. Donors are already addressing the
question of what aid will be needed to create a functioning Palestinian
administration, and an economy integrated with those of its neighbours and
the wider world.
European Community foreign ministers tomorrow will consider plans for an
Ecu500m (Pounds 383m) aid package to the West Bank and Gaza Strip - a
package aimed to capitalise on the historic breakthrough by Israel and the
Palestinians and to consolidate the EC's importance as a donor and trade
partner in the Middle East.
Scandinavian countries last week pledged Dollars 140m in aid to the
territories over the next four years. The US is seeking to 'facilitate
contributions' to the new Palestinian authority, but administration
officials have made clear that they do not expect to be the principal source
of finance.
Japan 'would have to help with restructuring in the region' once the accord
was signed, Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said yesterday.
In total, according to estimates based on a draft World Bank report and the
views of other economists, the new Palestinian 'entity' will require
external financing, both in aid and private capital flows, of more than
Dollars 4bn in the next decade.
This sum, according to Mr Stanley Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor who helped produce a Harvard University report on the
economy of the territories, represents the likely maximum the Gaza Strip and
West Bank could absorb.
'No running economy can take in more than about 10 per cent of GDP,' he
says, putting the combined annual gross domestic product of the West Bank
and Gaza strip at about Dollars 4bn.
This would also be a greater sum of aid, proportionate to the size of the
territories' economies, than the original post-war Marshall Plan for Europe.
Most to the point, according to several economists, such a sum is likely to
place Gaza and the West Bank - if adeptly managed - on a sound economic
footing. 'All the ingredients for growth are there,' says Mr Fisher.
As important as the gross sums of aid, however, will be the promptness and
co-ordination of their disbursement.
As a first step, officials from the PLO, Israel and its Arab neighbours will
meet in Washington on September 20 to discuss creating a central fund to
direct international assistance, under the World Bank, whose economists have
already created a detailed plan for regional economic development. The Bank
can lend only to member countries but is seeking ways around this hurdle for
the territories.
Swift as the initial response of the EC, the World Bank and others has been,
shadows hang over co-ordination of the international aid effort. It is
unclear, for instance, how the EC package will be aligned with wider
international attempts to create a viable economy in the territories, with
proper roads, water, and telecommunications.
Japan has already contacted the EC about the Brussels plan, but senior EC
officials say there has so far been no contact with the US.
What already looks clear, however, is the determination of donors to help
this historic opportunity succeed - not simply in creating a viable economy
for a Palestinian proto-state, but in encouraging both better Middle Eastern
development and the closer integration of the region's economies with, in
particular, those of the EC.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Dusty outpost
prepares to receive Arafat's cabinet - PLO could set up offices in former
British prison building / Jericho and the West Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUSTY, palm-fringed town of Jericho, in the barren Jordan Valley, seems
an unlikely choice for a Palestinian administrative capital.
It is small, dry and baking in summer. It lacks telephone lines, roads and
power. The biblical town's population is a mere 16,000 and its biggest
building the shabby, two-storey, 70-roomed Hisham Palace hotel.
Yesterday workers were busy plastering over cracks and painting the walls in
anticipation that the hotel will become the headquarters of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation. Residents are convinced Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, will move into a luxurious white-washed villa trimmed with green
window frames and ample lush gardens on the outskirts of the city.
They also say the PLO could take over the offices of the Israeli military
run administration which was once a British prison and the headquarters of
the Jordanian government until 1967.
But Palestinian officials, who are negotiating to have Israeli troops
withdraw from a 100 sq km area around Jericho, say the PLO will keep its
political and administrative headquarters in occupied Arab East Jerusalem.
Although a cabinet headed by Mr Arafat might meet in Jericho, the town will,
in essence, be an outpost for the administration of interim self-rule over
the whole West Bank.
Palestinians know it is the West Bank, with its more fertile and abundant
agricultural land and better natural and human resources, which could lay
the basis for real economic growth. The West Bank economy is dominated by
agriculture and tourism which contribute about 80 per cent of gross domestic
product.
The 5,500 sq km of the West Bank have many similar infrastructural needs to
those of the Gaza Strip, especially in sewage and solid waste management.
But it is considerably better off, largely as a result of Jordanian
administration until 1967 and a deeper integration with the Israeli economy
since.
In 1991, the last reliable figures available, the 1.1m residents of the West
Bank had gross national product per head of Dollars 2,000, compared with
Gazans' Dollars 1,230. Its physical and social infrastructure is less
dilapidated, it has fewer refugees in squalid camps, a lower dependence on
Israel and direct access to the Jordan market over the Allenby bridge.
Furthermore, a Palestinian authority will inherit considerable potential
assets in the West Bank, particularly in its better education system and
tourist resources.
According to the World Bank, a greater proportion of Palestinians complete
higher education than in neighbouring Arab states - 18 college graduates per
thousand people. Two of the universities in the West Bank - Bir Zeit, near
Ramallah and An-Najar in Nablus - are counted among the five most
distinguished higher education institutions in the Arab world.
At Bir Zeit's new campus young men in sneakers, sunglasses and baseball caps
wander past laboratories with high-tech equipment. The West Bank
universities are also famed in the Arab world for their unparalleled freedom
of speech.
However, since the financial crisis in the PLO, the eight universities have
had difficulty raising the Dollars 25m needed to run them and some salaries
have not been paid for months.
For tourism the West Bank is well endowed. There is the old city of
Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock mosque, the old walls of Jericho, the Mount
of Temptation, the Jordan River, the shrines of Bethlehem, souks, castles
and a strong craft industry.
With two power companies which buy power from Israel, the West Bank also has
the rudiments of an independent power industry.
Mr Hisham Awartani, an economics professor at An-Najar University, says the
greatest challenge for an incoming Palestinian administration will be making
the right policy choices and creating the appropriate institutions.
The PLO, he warns, must recast itself to face the challenge; first, it must
resist socialist voices calling for a state-controlled economy, and
nationalist voices demanding economic isolation from Israel.
'If the PLO creates a state-controlled economy we are doomed,' he said.
'Much will depend on how vulnerable the PLO is to trade unions, labour
groups and old-time socialists.'
It must also move swiftly to create transitional institutions of
professionals and technocrats capable of tackling the problems and
streamlining a co-ordinated strategy. International technical assistance
will be vital to plug the management gap of the PLO.
'Palestinians have great experience in democratic building of institutions,
and the PLO must realise this before they succumb to appointing their own
people to the administration.'
Other policy challenges will be to introduce, nearly from scratch, a
financial system after years when the only licensed bank has been the
Cairo-Amman bank.
This will entail creation of a new legal and administrative framework of
commercial and property law providing for a mechanism for enforcement on
loan defaulters. A new investment and licensing code will also have to
devised.
Taxation will also have to be increased to sustain the administrative
structures - even given Israel's undertaking to return tax revenues
presently collected from the territories - and a new trade policy must focus
on boosting exports to other destinations than Israel to reduce a big trade
deficit.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Gaza's worst problem
is its best hope - How a public works strategy could improve living
standards and kickstart the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEDOUIN women dressed in flowing black cloth herd their sheep across a
disused airstrip, overgrown with weeds, in the economically impoverished and
under-developed Gaza Strip. Like much of the infrastructure that will be
inherited by a Palestinian authority, the 300m airstrip, with no terminal
buildings, has suffered from years of neglect during 26 years of Israeli
occupation.
Nowhere are the gaping infrastructural needs more apparent than in the
rubbish-strewn and densely populated refugee camps of Gaza - home to at
least 260,000 of the 780,000 Palestinians crammed into the 365 sq km that
make up the Strip.
It is in Gaza, far less developed than the West Bank, that the political
peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians could be made or broken by
economic developments. Failure to meet economic expectations could backfire
and fuel Islamic fundamentalist groups which reject the peace accord.
In the filthy Jabalya camp, crowds of unemployed Palestinian youths gather
in the afternoon on the dusty roadsides to escape the heat and
claustrophobia of their tiny corrugated iron and breeze-block shacks.
Donkey-drawn carts carrying oil drums of water and crates of vegetables work
their way along streets where the stench of open sewage and contaminated
water is everywhere.
Economists agree that sewage, water and housing are the priorities facing
the Palestinian authority and external donors, despite a PLO decision not to
dismantle the refugee camps until talks on a final settlement within three
years. A programme of public works will be critical to alleviate a male
unemployment rate of 62 per cent, provide jobs for a population growing at
4.6 per cent and create the infrastructure needed to encourage wealthy
Palestinian, Arab and Israeli businessmen to invest.
Mr Alex Pollock, an economist with the United Nations Works and
Rehabilitation Agency in Gaza, said nearly all Gaza's infrastructure is
'either missing or in a deplorable state. We are talking about scrapping
most things and starting again.' But he believes an aid-backed public works
development strategy for a labour force with proven skills acquired in
Israel's construction sector could quickly alleviate poverty.
'Gaza's best assets are its slum conditions, its over-population and its
international goodwill,' he said. 'Its worst problem is its best hope -
because a well-funded public works programme could immediately provide jobs,
alleviate suffering and defeat political opposition.'
A draft World Bank report says external official financing of Dollars
1.5bn-Dollars 1.75bn will be needed to fund the public sector in both Gaza
and the West Bank for a five-year transition period, creating 12,000 jobs.
The report says public sector financing needs in the short and medium term
will centre on water and waste-water, transport, power and solid wastes.
'The upgrading of physical and social infrastructure, a key priority for
improving living standards of the population and for stimulating private
sector development, would have to be undertaken mostly by the public
sector,' the World Bank says.
Many of Gaza's pot-holed roads require urgent attention. In many parts of
the strip, especially around the villages, most roads are not even metalled.
The airport will have to be upgraded to carry at least light passenger
traffic between Gaza and the West Bank and add some freight facilities. But
economists warn against grandiose multi-million dollar projects - likely to
be urged on an incoming Palestinian authority for political and
nationalistic reasons - such as a deep sea port, an international airport
and a water desalination plant.
Housing will also be a priority, with Palestinians estimating that at least
120,000 new units must be built in the territories within a decade. So far
Palestinian and international economists are agreed that housing should be
left to the private sector, with the government assisting with a revolving,
low-cost loan scheme.
Much of the transitional economic phase will depend on success in
job-creation. Israel estimates the Gaza work force at 125,000, but
Palestinians say the figure is closer to 200,000. At least 10,000 new
entrants join the Gazan work force every year. Economists say that the
public works programme will not soak up the high unemployment.
Continued migrant labour to Israel, under a properly negotiated
Israeli-Palestinian framework, will be vital to the Gazan economy. It has
plummeted from 80,000 in 1987 (45 per cent of the work force) to 20,000
today largely as a result of restrictions imposed by Israel.
Ultimately, private sector development will have to be the main job-creator.
Gaza's industrial base, however, is limited.
The biggest industrial firms are the 7-Up bottling plant, a citrus packaging
factory and a textile plant which get sub-contracting work from Israel.
There are other small firms in plastics, woodwork and food processing but no
company employs more than 70 workers and no company has an annual turnover
in excess of Dollars 1m. Most of Gaza industries are family-owned or small
informal sector businesses with a maximum investment capital of Dollars
250,000.
A huge gap in management and executive skills for medium- and large-scale
companies will have to be filled in Gaza by the Palestinian expatriates who
have worked mostly in Gulf Arab states and who the World Bank hope will
provide an extra Dollars 200-Dollars 250m of private capital into the
territories over the next five years.
Another constraint will be the high price of land in the strip. In Gaza
city, which has only four buildings as high as 10 storeys, a dunum (1000 sq
m) sells today for Shk1.6m (Pounds 370,000). Apartments of 60sq m sell for
Dollars 55,000.
Its not all bad news. A Palestinian self-government will inherit a decent
education and health system with good teachers and medical staff  - in large
part due to the efforts of UNWRA, which devotes a substantial part of its
Dollars 84m annual budget for Gaza on the two services.
Primary and secondary education and health will, however, have to be
expanded. University education will benefit from integration into the
universities of the West Bank.
Also on the positive side of the economic equation is the bureaucracy in
Gaza. In all, 12,000 Palestinians work in the Gaza departments of the Civil
Administration and UNWRA, many with years of experience. Therefore, a
Palestinian authority could, initially, move into the buildings of the Civil
Administration in Gaza City and take over a slim and efficient
administration.

FT  10 SEP 93 / The Palestinian Economy: Lure of contracting bonanza -
Westerners jockey for position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE occupied territories may seem an unpromising location for western
companies to expect the beginnings of a Middle East contracting bonanza. Yet
that is the gleam in the eye of a number of western and Israeli businessmen.
It is certainly the outlook of those prepared to take a long view, not just
of the prospects for engineering and construction contracts in the
territories but also of the wider regional opportunities that may follow.
The immediate focus of attention is the programme in the West Bank and Gaza
being prepared by the World Bank in consultation with Israel, the
Palestinians and potential Arab and western donor countries.
According to a confidential draft report by the Bank, this should involve a
Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m) public works programme over the next five
years.
If its assumptions are correct, the Palestinian authority expected to take
over initially in Gaza and Jericho will soon be offering opportunities to
international contractors in road-building (the Bank estimates Dollars 330m
is needed up to 1998), power (Dollars 350m) and water and sewage treatment
(Dollars 280m).
When the period of interim self-rule is up, there will be potential for more
ambitious schemes such as upgrading power generation for the territories
(Dollars 600m), possibly along with moves to integrate the regional
electricity grid.
Among western governments and companies - especially European ones - the
jockeying for commercial advantage has already begun.
Western governments have agreed to work on feasibility studies for projects
in particular sectors and these sometimes coincide with a search for
commercial spinoffs.
Italy is working on ground water and waste disposal projects that could
yield business for its engineering concerns; France is pursuing the
transport sector, with an eye to road and rail projects for its hungry
construction and railway companies such as Alsthom Atlantique.
This pattern - whereby western countries contribute expertise in exchange
for contracts - will almost certainly continue as wider regional
opportunities open up.
The World Bank, Middle Eastern governments, and Arab and Israeli businessmen
have in recent months been working up a more far-reaching blueprint for
regional co-operation which could eventually revolutionise prospects for
business in the Levant.
At its most ambitious, this could involve projects which still seem to
belong in the realm of fantasy, such as a canal jointly run by Israel and
Jordan linking the Red Sea with the (lower-altitude) Dead Sea and generating
hydroelectric power to run a giant water desalination plant. Discussed at
the multilateral talks Jordan is so keen for a new source of water that it
wants to get on with it even before a peace deal with Israel is signed.
Whether or not it stands a chance of becoming reality, western companies are
beginning to factor the broad possibilities into their equations. In many
cases, their initial jumping-off point is Israel, already undergoing
something of an infrastructure boom. The Jewish state will in any case be
linked to the Palestinian entity in a free trade zone if the World Bank and
other donors have their way, so it too stands to benefit from an upswing in
activity in the West Bank and Gaza.
The Israeli government is dangling the prospect of business in the
territories and in Israel as a carrot to lure European and other countries
into providing financial support. During his Brussels meeting last week with
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, foreign minister Shimon
Peres suggested that EC member states might care to encourage their
companies to invest in or trade with the region by providing them with
generous credit guarantees.
In Tel Aviv, the Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce is receiving
unprecedented international attention, as companies hitherto deterred by the
secondary Arab boycott - which seeks to penalise those who do business with
Israel - scout for opportunities. Two months ago, it hosted the first ever
delegation to Israel from the Keidanren business organisation of Japan,
whose companies have long shunned Israel.
Mr Dan Gillerman, the federation's ebullient president, points to other
straws in the wind:
French companies are actively pursuing a contract to build a new railway
between Eilat and Tel Aviv, a link that could eventually become the nucleus
of a bigger regional railway between Riyadh and Damascus;
Siemens of Germany is looking into the potential for linking regional
electricity grids - a lucrative project that would also save Israel and its
neighbours billions of dollars by eliminating waste;
Mr Gillerman has been discreetly extending his tentacles into the Arab
world, meeting regularly with Palestinian and Gulf Arab businessmen. His
goal: to create a private sector 'Middle East fund', a consortium of Arab,
Israeli and other financial institutions that would provide seed money for
infrastructure projects such as toll roads.

FT  10 SEP 93 / The Palestinian Economy: Public services in Occupied
Territories inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE World Bank's draft report on 'Developing the Occupied Territories
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Investment in Peace' describes serious shortcomings in the infrastructure
to be inherited by an incoming Palestinian self-government.
'The provision of public services and physical infrastructure is highly
inadequate,' the report says, because of the state of public finances in the
occupied territories. First, neither the Israeli military-run Civil
Administration nor the utilities borrow to finance investment and are forced
to fund investments from revenues. Second, the bodies have inadequate
revenue resources. Third, there is a 'lack of coherence in sectoral policies
and programmes'.
The bank lists the inadequacies as follows:
Water: Intermittent supply leads to contamination of water from the
intrusion of polluted water into the networks.
Power: Some 138 Palestinian villages have no permanent, full-time
electricity supply. Sewage: Solid waste collection and disposal 'is grossly
inadequate, raising serious health and environmental concerns'. There are no
modern sanitary landfills and no satisfactory waste water collection or
treatment system.
Roads: 'The physical condition of the roads serving the Palestinian
population has deteriorated to the point where without immediate
rehabilitation, past investments may be lost completely.'
Communications: There is a large suppressed demand with the backlog for
telephone connections exceeding 12,500 in the West Bank.
Educational facilities are poor. The health infrastructure is less in need
of repair although hospitals and clinics are not efficient.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Healthcare revolution is nigh: Will Clinton's plan mean
cheap care or a free lunch?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trickle of leaks about the likely content of President Bill Clinton's
healthcare plan has turned into a torrent as the White House begins to
prepare for the most ambitious social reform since President Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society programmes of the 1960s.
Although some of the details of the plan may change before it is formally
unveiled later this month, the broad thrust of Mr Clinton's strategy is
clear. His political gamble is that the public will accept some new controls
on healthcare spending and some restriction on choice of physicians, in
return for an unequivocal guarantee that everyone, at all times, will enjoy
access to a standard package of healthcare benefits, regardless of age,
income or employment status.
The pledge of universal access to care would belatedly bring the US into
line with social policy throughout the developed world (at present South
Africa is the only other industrialised country which does not guarantee
care for all). It is important not just for the estimated 37m Americans (15
per cent of the population) without insurance cover, but for tens of
millions of families who fear losing insurance cover should a breadwinner
become unemployed or contract a serious illness.
To make good on this pledge Mr Clinton will propose controversial changes in
the way healthcare is financed and delivered. He will recommend that
employers be legally required to provide health insurance for employees and
meet at least 80 per cent of the cost of a policy providing the standard
package of benefits.
To allay Republican fears that such a 'mandate' on employers will kill jobs
by bankrupting small companies, the White House will propose public
subsidies to ensure that the burden on small companies (those with fewer
than 50 employees and average annual wages of under Dollars 24,000) is no
more than 3.5 per cent of total payroll costs. This would compare with
expected payments of 7-8 per cent of payroll for larger companies.
As part of a long-term strategy to reduce costs, Mr Clinton will propose
that the US adopts a form of 'managed competition'. He wants most
individuals and businesses to enroll in large healthcare purchasing
co-operatives to be known as regional health alliances. (Companies with more
than 5,000 employees will be able to form their own 'corporate alliances'.)
The idea is that the health alliances will collect contributions from
employers, employees and federal government and then act as a bulk purchaser
of care from competing groups of hospitals and doctors in the private
sector. Individuals (and companies) will be able to choose from a list of
'health plans' certified by the alliances as meeting the minimal federal
requirements.
The range of options in every area should include managed care, such as that
provided by Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), which sell pre-paid
plans, as well as more traditional fee-for-service medicine. But there would
be strong financial incentives to shift people into HMOs, which levy a flat
annual fee and thus have a strong incentive to control costs.
Under present plans those opting for fee-for-service schemes would have to
pay 20 per cent of the cost of each treatment, whereas those accepting
restricted access to doctors under HMOs would pay only a flat Dollars 10 per
visit. This would probably cause a rapid shrinkage of fee-for-service
medicine.
Mr Clinton has ruled out any direct controls on the price of medical
services, including drugs. But the White House intends to place tight caps
on the growth of federal programmes such as Medicare, the scheme for the
elderly.
Other more controversial cost-cutting proposals will include limits on the
rate of increase in private healthcare premiums (the first time the federal
government has interfered with spending in the private sector) and
legislation to make corporate healthcare spending in excess of the standard
benefits package taxable income for employees (at present there are no
limits on tax deductibility).
After the narrow passage of his deficit-cutting budget, Mr Clinton will not
be careful to avoid antagonising Republicans. Claiming reforms can be
financed mainly by limiting the growth of spending on existing federal
healthcare programmes, the White House envisions only a modest increase in
'sin' taxes on cigarettes; it has ruled out a general increase in income or
consumption taxes.
Several measures, such as subsidies for small business and the pledge that
fee-for-service medicine will remain an option for everyone (albeit an
expensive one) seem tailored to defuse conservative opposition.
Long phase-in periods for crucial elements of the plan will also increase
its chance of success. States, for example, will be able to delay
introducing the main reforms until December 1997, well after the next
election. For the most controversial proposals, such as limits on tax
deductibility, the phase-in period could be as long as 10 years.
Mr Clinton's pledge to guarantee security of access to care for all
Americans is likely to have a strong political appeal.
But many specific proposals, such as the mandate on employers to provide
insurance for employees, will be hotly opposed. Congress is certain to
insist on many modifications to the plan and will probably defer a final
vote until next spring.
When the initial enthusiasm for reform dies away, people may wonder whether
it is really possible to extend insurance cover to 37m people and improve
nearly everybody's benefits (for example by including more generous cover
for mental health problems and long-term nursing care) without raising taxes
significantly. To veterans of previous bids to control healthcare costs, it
sounds suspiciously like a free lunch.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Hillary Clinton yesterday met Democratic and Republican members of
Congress as the White House's efforts to build momentum for its healthcare
reform proposals gathered speed, George Graham reports from Washington.
Administration officials are telling members the reforms will trim more than
Dollars 90bn (Pounds 58.4bn) from projected government spending over the
years from 1994 to 2000, despite expanding the types of care paid for by
insurance and despite extending a guarantee of coverage to an estimated 35m
people who currently have no insurance.
Many members of Congress are sceptical about the prospects of actually
saving money with the reforms, despite an estimated Dollars 105bn of revenue
to be generated in 1994-2000 by an increase in the cigarette tax.

FT  10 SEP 93 / UN troops chief welcomes Clinton pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Jean Cot, commander of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday
welcomed a pledge by President Bill Clinton to send an unspecified number of
US peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, saying it would be a welcome boost to the
peace process.
However, Mr Clinton's pledge yesterday threatened to add to tensions in
western policy on Bosnia, after he insisted the troops would only operate
under Nato, not UN, control, and stressed that any deployment would need
full authorisation by Congress.
He said: 'It (the deployment) has to be enforced or, if you will,
guaranteed, by a peacekeeping force from Nato, not the United Nations, but
Nato.'
Diplomats yesterday warned that the US insistence on Nato control was likely
to be a significant stumbling block, given the insistence of Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, that peacekeepers in Bosnia must be
under UN control.
A UN diplomat yesterday said: 'This is a very fraught issue. Discussions
have been continuing for a long time, but it remains a big sticking point.'
Mr Boutros Ghali yesterday met Russian, British and French officials,
apparently to discuss the issue.
British and French diplomats yesterday reiterated that peacekeeping troops
would probably need to be under both Nato and UN, in spite of a widespread
recognition that Nato is best equipped to run a peacekeeping operation.
Mr Clinton's promise of troops for Bosnia came after he met Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic. In spite of Mr Izetbegovic's demand that the US
launch air strikes against the Serb and Croat forces to break the siege of
Sarajevo and add weight to his attempt to wrest more territory in the Geneva
peace negotiations, Mr Clinton refused to set any deadline for air strikes.
Under US pressure, Mr Izetbegovic said Bosnia's Moslem-led government was
ready to resume peace talks with Serbs and Croats. But at a news conference
he continued to insist that these adversaries must yield more territory for
an agreement.
Meanwhile Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, has cancelled plans to visit
Sarajevo next week because of the delay in the Bosnian peace talks, the
Pentagon said yesterday. He will meet US and European defence officials and
experts in Brussels on Saturday.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Pounds 3bn fund for breast implant cases planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and CLIVE COOKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN throughout the world with silicone breast implants may be eligible to
share up to Dollars 4.75bn (Pounds 3bn) in health benefits over a 30-year
period, under a proposal being discussed by both sides in litigation over
such implants.
Implant makers face thousands of lawsuits by women claiming implants cause
diseases of the immune system.
Dow Corning, once the world's biggest makers of silicone breast implants
before it withdrew from the business last year, said discussions had
progressed to a point where a proposal had been developed and was under
review.
The Michigan-based company, a 50-50 joint venture of Dow Chemical and
Corning, said the Dollars 4.75bn would be funded jointly by industry
participants (including manufacturers), raw material suppliers, insurance
carriers, physicians and other providers of health care. Details of how much
each participant would contribute are undecided.
Mr Gary Anderson, Dow Corning executive vice-president, stressed the
preliminary nature of the proposal: 'There are still many steps to go
through and conditions to be met before a settlement can be implemented.' He
described the proposal as 'essentially a 30-year insurance policy for women
with implants, so that they won't have to worry about being protected in the
future.'
After the defendants and trial lawyers have agreed a formula for sharing the
settlement, there are to be public fairness hearings across the US to test
it for fairness to women with implants.
Dow Corning and other manufacturers continue to deny that the implants are
unsafe, although they have been banned from widespread sale in the US.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, another former manufacturer, said it 'denies all
liability and has entered into these discussions to avoid protracted
litigation. It should be noted that scientific research has not established
a link between breast implants and disease.'
Dow Corning has already committed Dollars 10m to research on the safety of
the devices. 'We will probably end up spending Dollars 20m, which will not
be part of the proposed fund,' said Mr Anderson.

OLYMPIQUE MARSEILLE, the troubled French football club, yesterday won the
first round in its legal battle against exclusion from the European
Champions' Cup when a Swiss court temporarily suspended the ban, pending a
final ruling, reports Alice Rawsthorn from Paris.
Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French businessman and Socialist former
minister who chairs the club, vowed to stay on as chairman.
The Marseille club, which last season became the first French team to win
the European Champions' Cup, is fighting to overturn the decision on Monday
by Uefa, the European football authority, to ban it from this season's
competition because of a bribery scandal. Club officials have been accused
of trying to bribe players of a rival French team to rig a league match last
season.
The ban threatened to drive Olympique Marseille into bankruptcy because of
the loss of the estimated FFr150m (Pounds 17m) the club had expected from
its European games. A final court ruling on the Uefa ban is expected within
days.
The club's position is further complicated by an edict earlier yesterday
from Fifa, the world football authority, that it be suspended from the
French league unless it abandons its legal battle against the Uefa ban.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Hurd hits at role of journalists in Bosnia: Success of
media-free Middle East negotiations gives diplomats food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE language was diplomatic, but the pique was thinly disguised. When it
comes to dealing with the delicate world of foreign policy, too much
openness - and too many journalists - can sometimes do more harm than good,
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said last night, Gillian Tett
writes.
The timing of Mr Hurd's attack, made to the London Travellers Club, was not
entirely accidental. In recent weeks, the British government has faced
strong criticism in British papers over its cautious policy in the Balkans.
Today Mr Hurd is due to appear on German television in an effort to deflect
even fiercer attacks in the German press.
Meanwhile, the recent outwitting of the press corps over the secret Middle
East negotiations has given diplomats food for thought.
'There are some foreign policy subjects where absolute secrecy is possible,'
Mr Hurd said, pointing out that discretion had been crucial in Britain's
negotiations with Argentina after the 1982 Falklands war, or the 'two plus
four' discussions over the reunification of Germany.
Ignoring the media as earlier British prime ministers cheerfully did was no
longer possible, Mr Hurd admitted. He might have added that the British
government itself has lost little time in publicising aid initiatives,
culminating in the controversial 'Operation Irma' last month.
But with coverage liable to concentrate on horror spots, the 'something must
be done' syndrome left some journalists with much to answer for in Bosnia,
Mr Hurd claimed.
Some aid workers and diplomats in the Balkans might agree. The skill with
which UN relief workers have orchestrated the media in Bosnia has provoked
pique from low profile groups like the International Red Cross. Attempts by
the Bosnian parties to fight their propaganda campaigns through the western
press have rarely been welcomed by negotiators in Geneva.
Although the press was barred from Mr Hurd's speech yesterday, the Foreign
Office ensured it coverage by faxing his words to the newspapers.

FT  10 SEP 93 / SmithKline Beecham suffers US setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees yesterday refused to
recommend Tagamet, one of the best-selling products of SmithKline Beecham,
the Anglo-American health care group, for use over the counter (OTC) without
a prescription.
The decision is a serious blow for the company. The US patents for Tagamet,
an anti-ulcer product, expire next year after which the drug will be subject
to fierce competition from generic non-patented rivals.
Tagamet generated world-wide sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m)
last year, an estimated 75 per cent in the US.
The company had hoped to compensate for the loss of prescription sales after
the patent expiry by selling the drug over the counter without a
prescription for treatment of heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset
stomach.
The gastro-intestinal drugs advisory committee and the OTC drugs advisory
committee, said they were not concerned about the safety of Tagamet over the
counter. However, they believed further analysis was required to demonstrate
efficacy. This does not cast doubt on the efficacy of Tagamet in its
prescription form. The trials for OTC Tagamet involved doses of 100mg and
200mg. The prescription doses are 300mg, 400mg and 800mg.
SmithKline Beecham said yesterday it might be possible to re-submit data
from existing trials which had been re analysed rather than conduct
completely new trials.
SmithKline Beecham is the second pharmaceutical company to run into such
difficulties this year.

Mr Lopez Echague was picked up early on Thursday by a group of assailants,

unconscious.
Last month two men beat him and cut his face with a switchblade, cursing him
for investigating allegations that the ruling Peronist party uses hired
thugs as 'security guards' at rallies to prevent heckling.

The duties will be effective from Saturday, according to the EC's official

Local manufacturers complained that the Chinese bikes were undermining their

weighted 59 per cent. The duties will be on all Chinese bicycles, not just
the large-tyre, mountain variety.

FT  10 SEP 93 / BA presses for curb on European subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is putting pressure on the European Commission to adopt
tighter restrictions on government subsidies supporting financially troubled
national flag-carrier airlines.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA chairman, said yesterday the UK airline would argue
strongly, before a recently formed group of EC 'wise men', that recovery for
European airlines was achievable without the need for further protection or
state support.
The group was set up to analyse and propose possible cures for the European
airline industry, which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 454m) last year.
'Some Dollars 3bn have been pumped into three European airlines in the last
three years,' he said, adding that, as long as governments continued to
support their national carriers, there was little hope of getting airlines
in Europe 'fit to compete against the big US carriers'.
Apart from the Dollars 3bn in state support to Air France, Sabena of Belgium
and Iberia of Spain, other European carriers are waiting for state support.
These include Aer Lingus of Ireland, Air Portugal, Olympic of Greece. Sabena
may seek additional funds.
The UK government is expected to back vigorously BA's position on state
subsidies and to oppose any re-regulation in the now liberalised European
airline market.
The EC group of 'wise men' was set up this summer after a similar initiative
by the US administration. In Brussels yesterday, the group started hearings,
which will continue next week.
United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday also warned the
'wise men' that many European airlines were looking to their governments for
relief and protection from further competitive inroads by other carriers.
Mr Larry Nagin, United's general counsel, argued such action would be
counterproductive.
'The public cost of securing, for a favoured airline, some transitory relief
from competition would outweigh the public benefits which the protection
would provide,' he told the EC committee.
BA is also continuing to press for an agreement by the UK and the US
governments to clear the way for the completion of its partnership agreement
with USAir.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, is to hold further talks in
Washington next week on a revision of the existing air service agreement
between the UK and US, so as eventually to complete an 'open skies' accord
by the two countries.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department has approved the establishment of a free trade
zone centred on a cargo-only airport near Fort Worth, Texas, which would
boost a 20,000-acre development project owned by the family of Mr Ross
Perot, the Texas billionaire.
The new Alliance Airport and the surrounding area is envisioned as a
crossroads for a export boom for products going on to Mexico and the rest of
Latin America.
Mr Perot, a leading critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement, is a
minority stockholder in Hillwood Development, which plans to lease land and
buildings surrounding the airport to importers seeking more favourable
tariff treatment.
Mr Perot's son, Mr Ross Perot Jr, is the majority stockholder and a
supporter of Nafta. If the Nafta is approved by the US Congress, the airport
project will benefit from its location as a trade hub. If it fails, the free
trade zone designation is even more valuable.
The Dallas Morning News said the 'contradiction' between the positions of
the father and son has 'prompted some critics to question whether the former
independent presidential candidate is playing both sides of the free trade
issue'.
The US has 193 federal free trade zone projects, which allow domestic
business activity to take place as if it were outside US customs territory.
No duties or quotas are charged on re-exports; customs duties and federal
excise taxes are deferred and sometimes lowered on finished products which
emerge from the zone into the US market.

<TEXT>
AMADEUS, the computer reservation system (CRS) jointly owned by Air France,
Lufthansa of Germany and Iberia of Spain, yesterday reacted angrily to a
campaign by its US rival CRS system Sabre, owned by American Airlines.
The latter is accusing Amadeus of delaying new EC regulations on computer
travel reservation systems.
The European group claimed American Airlines was 'wilfully misrepresneting
the issue' by alleging that European carriers and Amadeus were attempting to
prevent European travellers benefiting from lower air fares provided by
Sabre.
'American actually tried to prove that Amadeus does not allow a travel
agency to search for lower fares in a document directed to the EC,' said Mr
Miguel Vermehren, Amadeus director of communications. 'We were able to show
not only that Amadeus displayed the same or lower fares than Sabre, but that
half of Sabre's fares were out of date.'
Amadeus said the issue facing the EC was one of data security and equal
chances for CRS distribution.
The EC postponed approval of new CRS rules after protests from several
European airlines insisting on separation of an airline's own internal
computer systems and the CRS marketed to the travel industry.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Spanish abandon pay pact deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH Government and trade union negotiators agreed last night to
abandon a deadline of September 20, in their attempts to agree a wages pact.
The government may now be retreating from its insistence that a pact is
essential to economic recovery.
Until a few days ago, senior officials in the finance ministry had been
saying that the government wanted a wages deal in place by September 20,
when the draft 1994 budget is to reach parliament.
On the expectation of a virtual wage freeze next year, and of rises below
the inflation rate for 1995 and 1996, foreign financial institutions have
been making heavy purchases in recent weeks of Spanish debt.
The wages deal was to have been the centre of a so-called social pact - to
encompass pensions, labour market reform and unemployment benefits  -
designed by the government in an effort to trim its large deficits. But,
after meeting the unions and employers yesterday, Mr Pedro Solbes, finance
minister, said talks before the budget debate closes on September 30 would
concentrate solely on issues that directly affected budget planning.
These talks would start next Monday, he said, and cover changes the
government wants to make in the way it calculates pensions - using forecast,
not past, inflation - for next year and proposed cuts in unemployment
benefit. Mr Solbes said that, if there were no agreement this month, the
government would set its own budget targets.
Prospects may not be bright. The unions will insist on a 'realistic', or
high, inflation target and strongly oppose any meaningful cuts in benefits,
which also fell sharply last year. If the government has to impose targets
in order to present its budget on time, then negotiating a wages deal and
labour market reform - which Mr Solbes said would start in October - could
become difficult.
Even so, Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, labour minister, denied last night that the
wages talks had been delayed. He said the government was still aiming for a
three-year deal and that the real test was whether it began on time, on
January 1.

FRANCE achieved a record trade surplus of FFr10.88bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in May,
as exports rose much more quickly than stagnant imports, according to
customs statistics announced yesterday.
The surplus was almost double the FFr5.8bn surplus recorded in April, which
was revised down from FFr7.6bn, and was well ahead of expectations.
An official at the economics ministry said that May trade figures
demonstrated the competitiveness of French industry. But economists
cautioned against reading too much into the statistics.

THE Bank of France responded cautiously to the German cut, reducing the rate
for five to 10 day funds from 10 per cent to 7.75 per cent but leaving the
more important intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent.
The German move gives the French authorities more room for manoeuvre in
lowering borrowing costs. But the cut in short-term rates, which brings
official French rates to their levels before this summer's currency crisis,
was seen as a limited step.
'It was the minimum reaction they could have taken,' said Mr Christopher
Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'Money market rates are
already below 7.75 per cent and no one expects them to rise again.'
He said the Bank of France would try to bring money market rates down from
7.5 per cent to about 7 per cent in coming weeks, before cutting the
intervention rate, the floor for money market rates.
The problem facing the French is the continued strength of the D-Mark.
Despite the Bundesbank rate cuts, the French franc lost ground against the
German currency yesterday, closing at FFr3.525 to the D-Mark in London,
about 3 per cent below its former ERM floor.
Despite the widening of the fluctuation bands, the Bank of France has sought
to keep the franc relatively stable against the D-Mark. This partly reflects
the central bank's need to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves after its
unsuccessful defence of the franc in the recent currency crisis.
Economists welcomed the German cut. 'If the Bundesbank didn't move, it would
have increased pressure on the French to go it alone,' said one. They
believe French interest rates will now see continued gradual reductions.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Italy to wield public spending knife: Rome has found it can
no longer afford an inefficient bureaucracy and welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government was last night due to announce cuts in pension
benefits, further streamlining of the health service, a reduction in the
number of ministries and a continued freeze on civil service recruitment to
save L28,000bn (Pounds 11.6bn) in the 1994 budget.
Before the cabinet met late yesterday, the unions lobbied to head-off a
freeze on civil servants' pay during 1994. But if a pay rise is conceded
this is unlikely to exceed 2.5 per cent - well below projected inflation of
3.7 per cent.
The public spending cuts are an unequivocal signal that the state can no
longer afford to support an inefficient, overmanned bureaucracy and a
welfare state that has been funded out of debt rather than taxes. The
austerity measures are also aimed at Italy's international partners,
especially the EC, demonstrating the government's seriousness in cutting
back the huge public sector deficit.
The 1994 budget deficit will be held down to about L144,000bn on the latest
calculations, compared to L155,000bn for the current year. This would be
equivalent to 9.7 per cent of gross domestic product, still nearly twice the
EC average.
But yesterday the Bank of Italy dropped the discount rate from 9 per cent to
8.5 per cent in response to the Bundesbank's move and this promised a
further annual reduction of some L7,000bn in the overall burden of Italy's
debt.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, is seeking to raise L32,000bn
through spending cuts and extra taxes. Officials said he had opted to obtain
the bulk through spending cuts because fiscal pressure was already high and
increased taxes risked being counter-productive.
The cuts are to be focused on pensions. The Amato government last year
introduced a reform of Italy's generous state pension system; but this did
not go far enough. The new measures will penalise state employees who seek
to leave (as they previously could) after only 20 years work.
Those leaving the state sector before making 35 years of contributions and
the private sector before 38 years will have their payments scaled back
progressively the earlier they retire. At the same time the government is
expected to postpone the revision of existing pension payments.
All ministries are being asked to find across-the-board cuts of 3 per cent
while the Ministry of Posts is expected to be abolished. Tighter control
will be exercised over government procurement contracts, and some 130,000
civil servants risk being switched to new jobs or face unemployment.
Additional income is due to come from the sale of government buildings. But
privatisation revenue has been deliberately excluded from the budget. On the
fiscal side, the government is due to make minor adjustments to value added
tax payments, reduce the scope for tax write-offs on government investment
and refine the 'minimum tax'.
The latter was an attempt to bring the self-employed and professions within
the tax net by assessing people on notional incomes for their declared jobs.
The tax was strongly contested by trade and professional associations.
However, so long as they are seen as the principal source of evasion, the
Ciampi government is unlikely to be too sympathetic.

The surplus was almost double the FFr5.8bn surplus recorded in April, which

An official at the economics ministry said that May's trade figures
demonstrated the competitiveness of French industry. But private economists
cautioned against reading too much into the statistics.
They said the sharp downward revision in April's surplus demonstrated the
unreliability of trade figures following the introduction of new compilation
procedures in the European Community at the beginning of the year. They
added that May's surplus largely reflected the weakness of the French
economy.
Imports in the month at FFr88.41bn were little changed compared with April's
figure. 'This reflects depressed spending in the domestic economy,'
according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Bros.
Exports, however, showed a healthy increase, rising by 5.7 per cent to
FFr99.29bn. The surplus on trade of industrial and military goods more than
doubled to FFr8.27bn.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Rebels force Greek government to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government was forced to resign yesterday after losing its
one-seat parliamentary majority through the defection of a little-known
conservative backbencher.
A general election will be held on October 10, seven months before the
conservatives' four-year mandate was due to end.
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, announcing his cabinet's resignation,
accused his political opponents of sabotaging the government's efforts to
implement economic reform.
'Greece cannot make progress in an atmosphere where the government's work is
being constantly undermined,' he said.
Mr Mitsotakis has faced as much criticism in recent months from within his
New Democracy party as from the socialist opposition, with dissent focusing
on the government's plans for partial privatisation of OTE, the state
telecoms company.
However, it was not until this week that Political Spring, a new
conservative splinter group, launched a co-ordinated campaign to bring down
the government.
Its leader, Mr Antonis Samaras, who was sacked as foreign minister by Mr
Mitsotakis last year for his unwillingness to compromise on recognition for
Macedonia, appealed to his half-dozen supporters among New Democracy
deputies to leave the party.
It looked until yesterday as if the government might survive, as only one
deputy, Mr Stefanos Stefanopoulos, a close ally of Mr Samaras, had declared
he would sit as an independent. Then came the unexpected departure of Mr
George Symbilidis, leaving New Democracy with only 150 seats in the
300-member chamber.
Mr Mitsotakis, who has little personal following among the Greek people,
cannot have much hope of being returned to power as head of a government.
The government's approval rating has plummeted in the past year as recession
deepened and the effects of structural reform, including wage-capping and
reductions in public sector hiring, started to be felt.
The Panhellenic Socialist Movement is already well ahead in the opinion
polls, despite persistent doubts that its ailing leader, Mr Andreas
Papandreou, would be strong enough to carry out the prime minister's duties.
Pasok officials have been trying to reassure businessmen and diplomats that
the party has set aside the radical policies of the 1980s, asserting its
commitment to European economic union. Nonetheless, the prospect of a change
in government sent shock waves through the Athens stock market, where the
index dropped by 6.8 per cent yesterday.
Victory for the socialists next month would certainly create problems for
the economy, at least in the short term. Pasok says it is determined to
abandon the conservatives' privatisation programme, which was expected to
yield more than Dr300bn (Pounds 857m) in revenues this year from the sale of
49 per cent of OTE, together with two state-owned oil refineries.
With tax receipts lagging far behind the budget forecast the loss of
privatisation income would cause a substantial shortfall in government
revenues.
Public debt amounts to more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product and
a socialist government would face serious difficulties in financing a higher
deficit.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Rest of Europe holds tight to Bundesbank coat-tails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's interest rate cut yesterday allowed several European
central banks to follow suit, and may trigger a further easing in monetary
policy in the coming days.
But each country in the exchange rate mechanism still faces the dilemma of
whether to decouple its monetary policy from that of the Bundesbank, pushing
short-term interest rates below Germany's.
The Bundesbank's cut in its Discount and Lombard rates was widely
interpreted as a move determined by stronger economic data in Germany, in
particular a lower level of German money growth than had been expected.
It had little to do with the pressing need to ease the cost of money in
Europe as a whole. 'This was a move determined by domestic factors, and
subsequent moves will also be determined by those factors,' said Mr Brian
Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
The other ERM members must decide whether to remain tied to Germany on
monetary policy, or to use the freedom provided by last month's ERM
relaxation to to cut borrowing rates more sharply.
The ERM's operating rules were drastically altered on August 2 when finance
ministers agreed to widen the fluctuation limits against the D-Mark from
2.25 per cent to 15 per cent.
But the remaining ERM countries - France, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal - have hardly capitalised on the changes by
letting their currencies drop against the D-Mark through sharp interest rate
reductions.
Instead, they are keen to maintain their currencies' values against the
D-Mark to preserve a semblance of the semi-fixed exchange rate system which
produced large inflows into their asset markets in recent years.
The caution was underlined yesterday when the Bank of France left its
important intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent, even though, in a
more technical move, it cut its five to 10 day money-market lending rate.
Belgium and Spain both shadowed the German move more directly, and Denmark
cut its 14-day Certificate of Deposit rate by  1/2 a percentage point
earlier this week. But there was no suggestion that any of these countries
would ease policy more drastically than Germany does.
However, France, Denmark and Belgium cannot hope to preserve the values of
their currencies simply by shadowing every cut in German rates.
Their currencies could come under heavy pressure against the D-Mark if
foreign exchange dealers believe that damage is being inflicted to their
economies by a failure to cut interest rates.
Nor can they count on the Bundesbank to ease pressure quickly enough to
remove that threat. 'The Bundesbank is clearly not in a mood to accelerate
its gradual programme of cuts in interest rates,' says Mr David Morrison,
international economist at the London office of US investment bank Goldman
Sachs.
It all adds up to what Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chemical Bank, calls a
no-win situation.
'Either they keep their interest rates on hold, and their currencies die a
slow death,' he said. 'Or they take the more sensible course of cutting
interest rates sharply. Their currencies would fall in the short term, but
they will appreciate on signs of higher economic growth.'
France would be in a strong position to adopt the latter policy. Its economy
is fundamentally strong, with a strong trade and current account surplus and
low inflation.
But a decoupling of policy would be more traumatic for the Danish and
Belgian authorities, who have seen their respective currencies depreciate in
the wake of this week's cuts in interest rates.
The Danish krone may be vulnerable because - following the relaxation of the
ERM bands - dealers have tended to place the currency alongside its fellow
Scandinavians, the Finnish markka and Swedish krona. Both of these had
substantial devaluations last year.
The Belgian franc could be even more vulnerable. Until recently, the move to
European monetary union diverted attention away from some of Belgium's
serious economic problems, including a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 130 per
cent. Following the recent crisis in the ERM, the Belgian franc has fallen
more sharply than any other currency in the system.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Swiss economy faces third year of decline

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND is heading for a third of year of modestly declining output,
with only a slow, weak recovery in prospect next year, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
It forecasts a 0.6 per cent decline in real gross domestic product this
year, after a 0.5 per cent fall last year, and sees only 1.6 per cent growth
next year.
Recovery will be hindered by poor prospects for exports, and by the sharp
rise in unemployment, which will limit private consumption, and by the
oversupply of commercial buildings, which will dampen private construction
investment.
The disappointingly slow fall of inflation will limit the central bank's
ability to reduce interest rates. Figures published yesterday showed the
annual inflation rate in August rose to 3.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent in
July.
The report is remarkable for its mild commentary on Swiss policies. This is
in stark contrast to its 1992 report which made swingeing attacks on the
high prices of most Swiss goods and services and on the central bank's
monetary policy.
The strongest criticism in the new report is of the government's quaint
practice of collecting income taxes only once every two years. The OECD also
worries about structural government deficits and high farm subsidies.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Frankfurt finally delivers goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday ended its cat-and-mouse game with the international
financial markets and delivered the cut in interest rates that everybody had
been waiting for.
After more than two months of refusal to cut the internationally sensitive
discount rate - a stubbornness which led directly to the July upheaval in
the European exchange rate mechanism - the German central bank chopped the
discount and the Lombard rates by half a percentage point to 6.25 and 7.25
per cent respectively.
The move brought confused and conflicting reactions inside Germany. The
German government, in the shape of Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister,
said the move would 'support efforts to restore growth within and outside
Germany'.
German industry, on the other hand, was much more sceptical. The German
chamber of commerce and industry (DIHT) described the move as 'questionable'
in the light of continuing excess growth in money supply. 'If interest rates
are cut again in spite of excessive money supply growth, the German
Bundesbank's money supply-oriented anti-inflation policy will be thrown into
doubt,' it said. The DIHT, like many economists, also doubted that the move
would have any significant direct effect on German economic growth - because
long-term interest rates are already at a historic low point. Its beneficial
effect, they said, will only come indirectly through export growth, if other
European economies can expand faster as a result of the interest rate move.
Mr Franz-Josef Link, of the IW economic institute in Cologne, attached to
the federation of German industry, cautioned against seeing the latest
recovery in the growth rate of gross domestic product - up by 0.5 per cent
between the first and second quarters - as anything more than stagnation.
For some time the markets have been expecting the Bundesbank to resume its
gradualist approach to interest rate cuts. Long-term interest Bund yields
have sunk to 30-year lows in anticipation of further easing and the German
stock-market has for weeks been buoyant. The DAX index of 30 leading German
shares closed marginally down yesterday and long bund yields closed
unchanged at 6.13 per cent.
There were technical and political reasons for the timing and size of the
cut.
The technical reason is that for nearly six weeks the repurchase rate at
which the Bundesbank supplies wholesale funds to the banking sector has been
extremely close to the discount rate. The Bundesbank's freedom of manoeuvre
in its money market operations is limited under such an interest-rate
constellation and observers expected the discount rate to fall by at least
25 basis points to create a decent gap between it and the repo rate.
The political reason is that the Bundesbank never likes to be seen to be
giving into international pressure when it makes its rate cuts.
The last meeting of the policy-making council coincided with a visit to Bonn
from the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur: not a good moment to
cut.
The next meeting is immediately after the International Monetary Fund/World
Bank annual meeting in Washington. To cut then might also seem like bowing
to outside calls for cheaper money.
These were not the arguments used by the Bundesbank to justify yesterday's
move however.
In a terse statement, the bank explained that there had recently been signs
of a gradual slowing down of the inflation rate - and that money supply
growth was likely to turn out to be less pronounced than had been feared
after the Bundesbank's currency interventions last month.
This positive message was amplified in comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president: he said the pressure on prices was quietening down.
The Bundesbank believes that its gradualist approach has succeeded in
restraining inflation - despite signs to the contrary.
'We wouldn't want to create the impression that Germany doesn't have any
inflationary problems any more,' Mr Schlesinger told the VWD news agency,
'but they are less pronounced than they were'. The annual inflation rate was
4.2 per cent in August - more than twice the Bundesbank's long-term 2 per
cent target. In July M3 - or broad money - grew well outside the the 4.5 to
6.5 per cent target range for the fourth month in a row. The 7.4 per cent
seasonally adjusted, annualised growth in July M3 was cited as a reason why
rates were not cut a fortnight ago.
Against this background, Mr Schlesinger's words and the interest rate cut
served to stimulate hopes of inflation below 4 per cent cent in October and
money supply back within the target range. This would allow further cuts in
short-term rates before the end of the year.
Mr Schlesinger said the council had reached its decision to cut rates after
assessing evidence that the German economy had passed its low point, citing
the fact that the small increase in western German GDP in the second quarter
of the year. 'We weighed all this up, without sharing in any great
optimism,' he said, reiterating the central bank's stance that German
industry cannot rely on interest rate cuts to reverse a recession or to
remove the need for structural measures.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Volkswagen urges prosecutors to interrogate Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN lawyers have written several times to public prosecutors
demanding that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, group production
director, should be interrogated as soon as possible on the suspicions
against him.
Even telephone calls to Ms Dorothea Holland, the senior prosecutor in
charge, had failed to produce a summons, Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, VW
spokesman said yesterday.
He was responding to charges from General Motors that VW was not
co-operating fully with the probe into suspicions that Mr Lopez and
colleagues stole secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and took
them to their new employer.
A claim from Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, that VW was paying
only 'lip service' to co-operation was 'unbelievable', Mr Wachs said.
Mr Lopez offered personally to testify on August 26, when Ms Holland and her
team searched VW's headquarters for possible evidence to support suspicions
of industrial espionage, he added.
During the raid Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, sent an electronic mail
message welcoming the search and asking all employees to co-operate
'constructively and openly'.
Mr Hughes could not be reached yesterday, but GM officials said Mr Lopez's
offers were 'tactical manoeuvres'. Ms Holland was more likely to be
interested in examining the haul from her search and preparing questions
based on the results than seeing him now.
Under German law a suspect may, at the prosecutor's discretion, see files on
the investigation at the time they are questioned. They are guaranteed
access when charges are imminent to allow them to prepare a public
statement.
According to an internal VW letter, signed by Mr Piech, the searchers
confiscated documents, 25 personal computers and around 250 diskettes.
People in the areas searched said the material was VW data, the letter
added.
'We have, as far as we were able to attend the search action, been able to
establish no indications that any secret data originating from GM/Opel was
found by the investigating authorities.'
Mr Hans Gab, vice-president of GM Europe, reached last night, noted VW had
already admitted 'potentially significant evidence' had been destroyed on
its premises.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and PLO agree to peace: Recognition achieved as
leaders exchange letters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, bitter enemies for nearly
three decades, recognised each other yesterday in a decision which will
enable the signing of an historic peace accord between the two parties in
Washington next week.
Israel said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, would sign a letter to Mr
Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in a public ceremony this morning after
receiving two letters signed by Mr Arafat last night in Tunis.
The Arafat letters, which were approved by the PLO executive, were being
ferried from Tunis to Jerusalem by Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian
foreign minister, who played a critical role in the Israeli-PLO dialogue.
In a letter to Mr Rabin, Mr Arafat commits the PLO to recognising the Jewish
state's right to exist in peace and security, to a peaceful resolution of
all future conflict, to a renunciation of terrorism and violence and to
convening the Palestinian parliament-in-exile to amend its founding charter
which denies Israel's right to exist.
In the second letter, addressed to Mr Holst, Mr Arafat says that after
Monday's signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord on self-government
for the occupied-West Bank and Gaza Strip, he will call on the 1.9m
residents of the Israeli-occupied territories to suspend the intifada - the
six-year-old Palestinian uprising.
Mr Rabin's letter to Mr Arafat says: 'The government of Israel has decided
to recognise the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and
commence negotiations with the PLO within the Middle East peace process.'
The letter marks the abandonment of years of virulent Israeli hostility to
the PLO, which it had branded a terrorist organisation bent upon the
destruction of the Jewish state.
The move paves the way for an end to a conflict marked by terrorism,
assassinations, hijackings and violence committed by one side or the other
since the PLO was set up in 1964. It also paves the way for the first
durable peace between Jews and Arabs. in the Holy Land and the beginnings of
a Palestinian homeland. Earlier, Mr Rabin told Labour party MPs that Mr
Arafat would tell the residents of the occupied territories that 'a new era
has begun, an era of reconciliation, building and co-operation, and
especially opposition to terror and violence'.
Mr Moshe Shahal, Israeli police minister, and Mr Holst said separately that
a broader agreement on Palestinian self-rule, including immediate Israeli
military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, initialled
in Norway three weeks ago, could now be signed in Washington on Monday. A US
official said the ceremony was set for 11am at the White House.
Mr Arafat said he would attend the signing if he was invited by President
Bill Clinton to the ceremony. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister,
who clinched the peace deal, is expected to sign for the Jewish state. Mr
Arafat is currently barred from entering the US after Washington cut
contacts with the liberation movement in 1990. Mr Clinton, however, said
yesterday the US would now consider resuming dialogue with the PLO 'if the
PLO statement . . . meets the criteria we have repeatedly set down:
renouncing terrorism and acknowledging Israel's right to exist'.
Both Mr Peres and Mr Arafat appeared in an unprecedented live connection on
French Television. 'This is really an historical change after 100 years of
war, Holocaust and victims,' Mr Peres said.
Yesterday's breakthrough on mutual recognition follows days of secret and
difficult negotiations in Paris over how to word the letters. The PLO was
concerned about Israel's demand that it suspend the intifada.
The text was finally nailed down between Mr Uri Savir, director-general of
Israel's foreign ministry and Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), head of the PLO
economics section, after it was agreed Mr Arafat could send a second letter
to Mr Holst which specifically avoids using the word intifada.
In Israel there were signs that virulent right-wing opposition to the
agreement was waning. Mr Ariel Sharon, one of Israel's most uncompromising
hawks, said the right wing led by the Likud party should accept that the
peace agreement was irreversible.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Bundesbank move triggers wave of rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, ROBERT GRAHAM and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK cut its internationally important discount and Lombard rates
by half a percentage point each yesterday, prompting a wave of rate cuts in
continental Europe.
But the German central bank's decision to make only a slight cut in the
'repo' rate, at which it supplies funds to the banking sector through money
market operations, to 6.7 per cent from 6.8 per cent, led financial markets
and economists to view the monetary easing with caution.
The Bundesbank reduced its discount rate to 6.25 per cent from 6.75 per
cent, its first cut since July 1, and in effect dropped the floor for German
money market rates by half a percentage point. The Lombard rate, at which
the Bundesbank lends emergency funds to banks against collateral, was
lowered to 7.25 per cent from the 7.75 per cent level set immediately before
the late July crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The German move was followed by rate cuts in France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Austria. Other ERM central banks, though, appeared reluctant to
treat the German move as a signal for sharp cuts in interest rates or for a
decoupling of their currencies from the D-Mark in the ERM's wider 15 per
cent fluctuation margins agreed last month.
The Bank of France reduced the rate at which it lends five-to-10-day funds
from 10 per cent to 7.75 per cent but left the more important intervention
rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. Belgium, while cutting its discount rate by
half a point to 6.50 per cent, reduced its important central rate by only
one quarter of a percentage point to 10.25 per cent. The Netherlands reduced
its official rates by only a quarter of a percentage point.
Financial markets reacted coolly to the news. Equities in Frankfurt were
slightly lower at the end of official trading before declining further in
after-hours dealings.
The rate cuts left the D-Mark unscathed. The dollar fell sharply against the
German currency, losing more than two pfennigs in London to close at
DM1.597. It was little changed in New York.
The Bundesbank said it had resumed its policy of gradually lowering interest
rates because of recent evidence of a gradual slowdown of inflationary
pressures in Germany.
Another factor was the recent strength of the D-Mark, coupled with signs
that money supply growth had not been as high as feared after the Bundesbank
intervened in currency markets last month, the central bank said.
German politicians welcomed the Bundesbank's move. Mr Theo Waigel, finance
minister, said it would support the recovery of economic growth in Germany
and abroad.
Although the cuts in Germany's two 'headline' rates were more than expected,
verdicts among economists and industry were mixed. Mr Thomas Mayer,
economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said: 'It combines a technical move
with genuine easing of monetary policy.' The BDI, the Federation of German
Industry, welcomed the rate reduction, but said it was too soon to talk of
an 'all clear' for German industry.
Some economists pointed out that the direct impact on German industry of
yesterday's cut in short-term rates would be negligible because the bulk of
German companies' borrowing was long-term, where rates had been at 30-year
lows for some time. But Mr Jurgen Pfister, head of economic research at
Commerzbank, said: 'The cut will have considerable symbolic effect as it
proves the Bundesbank's determination to keep on reducing rates.' European
monetary officials suggested that the Bundesbank had cut its rates yesterday
to 'clear the decks' in good time before the retirement of Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the central bank's president, at the end of this month.

FT  10 SEP 93 / Major puts down revolt by right wing over taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent and ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday sought to exert his authority
on the government by facing down a right-wing revolt on taxation and warning
ministers not to step out of line in future.
In a robust lecture to the first cabinet meeting for six weeks, Mr Major
warned that grass roots Conservative activists were fed up with government
disunity.
He said the government must unite around agreed policies and draw a line
under the battering it has sustained since its unexpected victory in the
1992 general election.
The message was rammed home by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, who reported on soundings taken from more than 150 constituency
chairmen in the past week.
Sir Norman said regional officials were desperate for a renewed sense of
unity in the party, and tired of the splits and recriminations of the past
year.
He also confirmed the party's decision to concentrate its resources on
fighting the growing threat posed by the Liberal Democrats in the south and
south-west of England.
Rightwing hopes of heading off the possibility of tax increases in the
November budget were torpedoed in a forthright intervention by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Clarke forestalled any challenge to his budget strategy by saying all
options remain open and ruling out a renegotiation of next year's agreed
spending total.
His vigorous defence of the chancellor's traditional right to control
budget-making silenced rightwing ministers, who judged it prudent to drop
plans to air the taxation issue.
However, Mr Clarke pleased rightwingers in a speech to the CBI in Glasgow,
in which he reaffirmed the government's determination to cut spending in the
long term and promised a second year of tough controls on public sector pay.
'I have read some mistaken speculation that I might relax on the public pay
front. Do not worry,' the chancellor said. 'We need to see the current pay
realism continue.'
Trade union leaders at the TUC conference in Brighton were dismayed. Some
warned of industrial action if the government tried to tighten this year's
1.5 per cent limit on pay rises.
Mr Alan Jinkinson , general secretary of Unison, the public service union,
said he had no doubt about the 'serious consequences' of another year of
imposed pay policy: 'Public service workers have already paid an unfair
price for the government's inept mismanagement of the economy.'
Most of the cabinet discussion took place at a one and a half hour meeting -
held without officials - which followed a formal half-hour official cabinet
meeting restricted largely to administrative matters.
The tone of the debate reflects Mr Major's determination to exert a firmer
grip on the government, which he believes can revive its popularity in line
with economic recovery.
However, rightwing backbenchers continued to claim that any increases in tax
would be suicidal for the government.

FT  09 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) Global union watch on Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 17th September 1993) appended to this article.
A WORLDWIDE trade union council is to be established representing workers
employed by companies owned by Hanson, the conglomerate.
This was announced yesterday after a meeting of TUC leaders with the
AFL-CIO, the US trade union body, and the United Mineworkers of America.
The council will be permanent with worker representatives worldwide. The aim
is to co-ordinate union strategy across the Hanson subsidiaries.
The TUC and AFL-CIO said they would be seeking a meeting with the company to
discuss creating a joint company-union council.
Yesterday's announcement is the latest response to the current strike in the
US by miners, including 17,000 employed by Peabody, the biggest private coal
company in the US and a wholly owned Hanson subsidiary. The protest, which
has been going on since February, is against the Bituminous Coal Association
of which Peabody is a member. The United Mineworkers of America are
demanding that jobs should be offered to unionised miners in new pits when
exhausted ones are closed.
The strike has turned into a bitter struggle over the future of trade
unionism in the US coal industry. As the leading negotiator in the
mineowners' association, Peabody is setting the pace for non-unionism in an
industry where two-thirds of the 100,000 miners are still organised.
The close involvement of the TUC and the AFL-CIO reflects a growing
partnership across the Atlantic. They want to establish more global
organisations to press for the establishment of social clauses established
by the International Labour Organisation and the OECD in agreements with
global corporations.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, made no comment about the
proposal for a joint company-union council. He said: 'We have excellent
industrial relations.'
MSF, the technical union, has announced what it calls a US-style corporate
campaign against Zurich Insurance company over its decision to de-recognise
the union. MSF has 1,000 members employed by Municipal Mutual Insurance,
which was acquired by Zurich earlier this year.
The campaign involves legal action, local and national lobbying, and
advertising.
CORRECTION
ON September 9 the FT wrote that Mutual Municipal Insurance had been
acquired by Zurich Insurance early this year. Zurich Insurance has in fact
only acquired parts of the business of MMI.

<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food company, is to merge Kraft General
Foods Europe and Jacobs Suchard, its two main European food businesses. The
link-up creates a group with sales this year of about Dollars 9bn in 20
countries.
The group, to be called Kraft Jacobs Suchard (KJS), will be Europe's third
largest food manufacturer after Nestle and Unilever, and will have
particularly strong positions in coffee, confectionery and cheese.
Integration of the two businesses, which will be phased over the rest of the
year, is designed to improve productivity, cut costs, streamline management,
and unify marketing in the face of increasingly tough competition in Europe,
company executives said.
Mr Raymond Viault has been named president and chief executive of KJS. He
previously headed Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery and coffee company
which Philip Morris acquired three years ago for Dollars 3.8bn.
Jacobs Suchard has until now operated almost separately from Kraft General
Foods Europe, which was formed out of Philip Morris' acquisitions of Kraft
and General Foods of the US in the 1980s.
The two businesses' headquarters will be merged in one office in Zurich,
Switzerland, and their operations in most countries combined under one
management. Mr Viault said the reorganisation would create 'some
redundancies' among the group's 32,000 staff in 20 countries.
He said the merger, which has been under discussion for five months, was
expected to achieve some 'fairly significant savings,' particularly in
purchasing, distribution and warehousing.
Germany, where KJS will have annual sales of Dollars 3bn, will be the
group's biggest national market, followed by Italy and France. Mr Viault
said expanding the group's cheese business in France and central Europe,
probably by acquisition, was one of his top priorities.
Freia Marabou, the Norwegian confectionery and snacks manufacturer purchased
by Philip Morris last year, is excluded from the reorganisation.

THE US and Japan today begin a series of talks under a framework agreement
aimed at ironing out bilateral trade and economic issues. They will provide
the first glimpse of the new Japanese government's stance on trade.
The talks, agreed between President Bill Clinton and former Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, will cover a broad spectrum of issues, including reduction
of the Japanese current account surplus and improved market access for
foreign companies in specific Japanese sectors. Since the framework talks
were set up Mr Miyazawa has been replaced by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
An agenda for future discussions and possible co-operation is likely to be
established at the meetings. Five areas for co-operation have been agreed
between the two countries; Aids research, the environment, development of
human resources, technology, and population planning in developing
countries. But interest in the talks, being held in Washington, will focus
on whether or not the US renews pressure on Japan to set quantifiable
targets in opening up specific markets to US products and reducing its
surplus.
Although Tokyo's stated commitment to deregulating markets has been welcomed
by Washington, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance minister, yesterday
renewed opposition to Washington's demand that it set a target for reducing
the surplus.
In a joint statement issued after a July summit of the Group of Seven
industrialised nations, the two countries called for a 'highly significant'
reduction in Japan's surplus. The US has been asking for a cut from 3 per
cent of GDP to between 1-2 per cent, but Japan has resisted setting a
numerical target on the grounds that this would lead to managed trade.
However, some Japanese industrialists say a quantifiable target should be
set for the reduction.

RUSSIAN and US and defence leaders met yesterday to further improve military
ties between Moscow and Washington and to discuss nuclear and other issues,
Reuter reports from Washington.
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, and US defence
secretary, Mr Les Aspin, met at the Pentagon to sign a defence co-operation
agreement as the two countries rapidly build bridges.
The two met in Germany three months ago and said then that the agreement
would pave the way for a range of moves, including joint peacekeeping
manoeuvres.
One future exercise is expected to involve Russia's big 27th Motorised Rifle
Division and the 3rd US Infantry Division based at Frankfurt.
Mr Aspin said that future joint peacekeeping exercises could take place in
Russia, the US and Europe.
Yesterday's agreement also improves telephone communications between the US
and Russian defence ministries, enabling Gen Grachev and Mr Aspin, as well
as top military officers, to discuss issues on a regular basis.
Mr Aspin noted that the plan includes annual meetings between US and Russian
defence ministers as well as senior military officers and one exchange
involving about 100 promising young military officers each from Russia and
the US. The two ministers also discussed nuclear and other issues, including
Russia's moves to destroy hundreds of former Soviet nuclear weapons on its
territory.
At the Pentagon last week, senior Russian and US defence officials signed
two agreements providing additional US assistance to help Russia destroy the
weapons.
The nuclear agreements signed at the Pentagon last week provide Dollars 85m
in US equipment and training to help build a storage facility in Russia for
nuclear material taken from former Soviet warheads and for protection of
civilian nuclear material in Russia.
The agreements, along with other nuclear aid memorandums already signed,
brought to Dollars 370m the total being provided by Washington to Moscow to
destroy nuclear arms and protect nuclear material from falling into
terrorist hands.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Progress on EC steel restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESTRUCTURING of the recession-torn European steel industry took a step
forward yesterday when the European Commission agreed a loan scheme to help
producers make capacity cuts.
The scheme is a key element in the European Community's efforts to enable
the industry to shed 30m tonnes in excess crude steel capacity.
But steel industry observers warned last night that the much-needed
restructuring of the industry - most of which is losing money heavily in
spite of recent price increases - still faces big obstacles before it can be
implemented.
The Commission said it would provide loans to companies, grouped along three
product lines, which agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts made by
the end of next year.
The loans would be paid back by the companies which did not cut capacity.
Officials said the fund would earmark about Ecu1bn (Dollars 1.17bn) to cover
capacity cuts of 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip, 2m tonnes of plates
and 2.5m tonnes of heavy section.
The product-based loan scheme is one of the less controversial elements of
the steel restructuring plan. Even so, it is reported that approval has
already been postponed once because some commissioners queried what
repayment guarantees the steelmakers would give. But agreement on the loan
scheme could at least restore some momentum to the restructuring effort,
whose original timetable has begun to look unrealistic.
In February, the Commission gave steelmakers until September 30 to present
closure programmes to qualify for its rescue plan.
However, the original timetable has slipped because of the deadlock in the
summer in the Commission's negotiations over state subsidies, notably with
the Italian government in relation to the struggling Ilva steel group.
The Commission has still not resolved this case, or that involving the
Spanish steel industry. The sticking point is the amount of capacity, and
jobs, that producers are prepared to cut in return for receiving the state
subsidies.
But private sector companies want the subsidy issue resolved before
agreement can be reached on any capacity cuts they might offer. Some private
sector producers have become increasingly exasperated at the lack of
progress.
Last month, a select committee of the UK's House of Lords entered the debate
with a strongly-worded report that warned against further state subsidy to
support inefficient production. It said the restructuring plans could be put
at risk unless a strict timetable is enforced to settle outstanding
disagreements on state aids.
The report said restructuring of the EC steel sector was long overdue, and
warned that excess capacity hit profitability throughout the industry. It
said there was 'a real danger' that efficient private companies could suffer
at the expense of inefficient state producers. The subsidies issue will be
discussed by EC industry ministers on September 21. The ministers must also
review the loan scheme.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Brussels tightens Italian aid curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday reinforced its increasingly tough line on
state aid in Italy when it attached strict conditions, applicable to all
Italian state holdings, to its authorisation of payments to creditors of
Efim, the liquidated state industrial holding.
Yesterday's decision follows a preliminary deal reached in July between Mr
Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition, and Mr Beniamino
Andreatta, Italian foreign minister, which allowed for repayment of half the
bank loans.
Efim was put into liquidation in July 1992 with total debts of nearly
L18,000bn (Pounds 7.49bn). Financial institutions were owed L9.3bn of this,
including more than L3,500bn to foreign banks. The loans were guaranteed by
the state under Italian law, and Rome argued it was obliged to honour what
amounted to sovereign debt.
The Commission accepted this argument, but in effect held up the deal as
part of a wider effort to bring Italian state aid under control. At the time
of the July understanding between Brussels and Rome, the Italian government
withdrew its plan to write off debts worth Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.08bn) run up by
Ilva, the steel group.
The two sides are still negotiating the size of the write-off against
Commission demands for a sharp reduction in steel capacity, due to be
discussed at a special Council of Ministers meeting in two weeks' time. Now,
as part of the definitive agreement on Efim, the Italian government will
have to:
Impose a freeze on debt at state-owned companies by the end of 1993;
Reduce this debt to levels in equivalent companies in the private sector by
the end of 1996;
Revoke the government's loan guarantee arrangements to state-owned companies
immediately afterwards;
Agree to the Commission's joint monitoring of the whole process.
'We have to ensure that in a few years' time the (Italian) state won't come
back to us with the same arguments,' a spokesman for Mr Van Miert said. The
remainder of Efim's debts, largely to suppliers, will be dealt with under
normal state aids procedures, the Commission stated.
Italy's labour minister yesterday played down the risk that job riots could
spread following violent protests over the threatened closure of a chemical
plant in the southern port of Crotone, Reuter reports from Rome.
'There is an emergency, but there will not be 10, 100 or even 1,000 other
cases like Crotone,' the Labour minister, Mr Gino Giugni, told the daily la
Repubblica newspaper after workers reacted to lay-off notices by destroying
part of their condemned factory.
In Crotone itself, riot police continued to surround the factory which
hundreds of workers were occupying.
On Monday night, protesters sacked the plant's offices and set fire to a
main road by pouring highly toxic phosphorus on it after ENI, the state
energy group, said it would lay off 80 per cent of the workforce at its
Enichem plant in Crotone.
Unions have accused ENI of acting irresponsibly over the Crotone lay-offs
and warned that violence could break out in other high unemployment areas.
Union leaders said that decisions like ENI's in Crotone, or the sacking of
2,000 municipal workers in Naples, were either sheer stupidity or a
deliberate ploy to make the south explode.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Japan's coalition halves proposed party subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government is to scale back plans for public subsidies for
political parties by half, to heal a potentially embarrassing rift with its
largest coalition member.
The seven coalition groups expect today to agree draft proposals for a
Y300bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year public political subsidy, said officials. This
would replace corporate donations and is equivalent to Y250 per taxpayer
each year.
Last month, the coalition partners provisionally agreed a Y600bn annual
subsidy, only to be embarrassed when the defeated LDP counter-proposed
Y300bn. This jeopardised the popular new government's image as the bringer
of a change in political style from the LDP, whose downfall came partly due
to public disgust at its dependence on large, sometimes corrupt, corporate
donations.
Ministers hurriedly explained that the Y600bn figure was only tentative,
after objections from the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition
member, whose chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana, happens to be minister for
political reform.
The subsidy is part of a package of political reforms, including a new
single-seat constituency electoral system, for debate at a special
parliamentary session starting on September 17.
Public subsidies would fill some of the gap left by corporate donations, to
be phased out after three to five years, according to early drafts of the
package. The aim is for parties to compete with equal financial backing,
instead of on their ability to wring cash from companies in return for
favours.
In spite of the inevitable internal coalition wrangling to have emerged in
the month since coming to power, public confidence in the government appears
hardly shaken.
Three opinion polls yesterday showed that the administration's popularity
remains high, as do public expectations. A Kyodo news agency poll gave Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa's administration a 79 per cent popularity rating, a
post-war high for any Japanese government, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper
gave it 71 per cent. The Mainichi Daily News recorded a 10 percentage point
drop in the government's popularity over the past month, to a still high 65
per cent.
However, the real test of confidence in the the government will come when
the public sees final details of the electoral reform plans as well as a
hotly waited economic stimulus package.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North
Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with
Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks concerning the
inspection of its nuclear facilities, but it later added preconditions for
the meeting it had proposed for tomorrow.
It demanded that Seoul stop its support of international efforts to force
nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to
its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. Mr Hwang In-sung,
South Korean prime minister, in rejecting the conditions told Mr Kang
Song-san, the North Korean premier, that Pyongyang's demand 'makes it
doubtful if your side has a genuine intention of reopening dialogue'.
North Korea suspended regular contacts with Seoul at the beginning of the
year in protest against the holding of the Team Spirit exercise. It failed
to appear at a meeting yesterday to discuss procedural matters for the talks
tomorrow.
If North Korea boycotts that meeting, it could lead to the end of hopes for
an quick resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.
The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if Pyongyang
does not make progress in nuclear inspection talks with both the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Seoul by the end of month.
North Korea last week held inconclusive talks with the IAEA on allowing its
inspectors to examine two nuclear waste sites that are at the heart of the
dispute.
The IAEA, which has heard no response yet from Pyongyang for a proposed new
round of talks in Vienna, will discuss the issue at its next governors'
meeting on September 21.
The IAEA wants to inspect North Korea's facilities to determine whether
Pyongyang is producing more plutonium than it has reported to the agency.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (26): Age of the city car is
about to dawn - The Car of the Future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of us, the name Mercedes-Benz evokes images of large luxury cars.
Yet one of the most significant potential trends for cars of the future is
that Mercedes will unveil a concept car smaller than a Ford Fiesta at the
Frankfurt motor show this week, and that the ideas it incorporates will
provide the basis for a production Mercedes of the late 1990s.
The age of the 'city' car - small, light, miserly on fuel or alternatively
using electrical energy - appears to be about to dawn in Europe.
The Twingo runabout from Renault, and the Polish-built Cinquecento from
Fiat, have already given renewed momentum to the European market for very
small cars - a market all but ignored during the economic boom years of the
1980s. (The sector is long-established in Japan, where there is a
flourishing market for 'microcars' specifically designed for urban use.)
Current cars, however, are equated with cheapness and utility. Mercedes'
model, which in concept form is called the Vision A 93, should show, once
and for all, whether the 'city' car concept can be satisfactorily taken
'up-market.'
Rapidly increasing urban traffic congestion, concern about the pollution
thus caused, and even the prospect of city centres being closed to all but
electric cars or other very 'clean' alternatives have been driving factors
behind the development of the 'Vision' - together with Mercedes' own
acknowledged need to find commercially attractive new market sectors.
But Mercedes is not alone. BMW has produced a three-seater prototype of its
own, the Z13. Volkswagen will start production of its city car, the Chico,
in 1995, and many other manufacturers have similar projects in development.
BMW's Z13 is more obviously a 'city only' car than the Mercedes. It has been
designed and developed mainly for driver-only operation; it is powered by a
1.1 litre motorcycle engine mounted at the rear with a continuously variable
automatic transmission. The driver is seated centrally, with two full-sized
seats for possible passengers set back slightly on either side.
The Vision has been designed as a four-seater and is intended to be usable
on longer journeys. With impact safety in mind, the engine - petrol, diesel
or battery-powered electric - is located centrally under the passenger
compartment.
Importantly, Mercedes claims that the petrol and diesel engines would both
qualify as 'ultra-low emissions vehicles' under California's draconian clean
air regulations, and the electric version would qualify as a 'zero emissions
vehicle' (ZEV). Starting in 1998, California will require 2 per cent of a
manufacturer's total car sales to be of ZEVs, rising to 10 per cent by the
year 2010, if the manufacturer wants to go on selling its vehicles in
California's 1m-plus annual new car market.
Both the BMW and the Mercedes models would have in common in their bodies
the extensive use of aluminium, seeking the lightness needed for good fuel
economy from small capacity power units, or in compensation for the weight
of the air conditioning, mobile telephone, navigation system and fax - all
considered as possible de rigeur fitments for cars towards the end of the
1990s.
Not surprisingly, aluminium producers are watching these developments with
the closest interest: it now looks increasingly likely that the material
will have a much expanded use in the car of the future.
Aluminium's attractions are obvious: it is extremely light and much easier
and cheaper to shape than steel. On the other hand it is more easily
damaged; it is more difficult to weld than steel; and it requires a great
deal of energy to produce, so it is a good deal more expensive.
In terms of total energy requirement, however, its exceptional capacity to
be recycled works in its favour in the long term. Smaller, lighter engines,
gearboxes, driveshafts and other mechanical components can be used.
So far, aluminium has provided the main bodywork only for expensive, limited
production cars such as Aston Martin or Honda's NSX sports car. But the next
substantive move towards wider adoption by vehicle manufacturers is
imminent, within the next few months, with the launch by Audi of its
replacement for the V8 saloon and which will have an aluminium chassis.
The car will mark the culmination of an ll-year collaborative project
between Audi and Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa). It required not only
the development of new alloys with the required crash protection properties,
but also new production processes. The car will have a skeleton-like
spaceframe made up of about 100 robotically welded pressings - about one
third the number required in a steel-bodied car.
The partners' faith in the future of aluminium for the motor industry is
such that Alcoa has built a Dollars 70m facility at Soest, Germany, to make
the spaceframes - and to offer its services to other vehicle makers.
However, the material is not yet a candidate for cheaper, very high volume
production cars; at present the process is cost-effective only for
production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year.
But the revival of interest is aluminium is causing a certain amount of
wariness at some large chemical groups such as Dow and DuPont, which have
large plastic composites interests. For much of the 1980s it appeared that
plastic composites could emerge as stronger, non-rusting rivals to metal for
the load bearing main structure of a car. Complexity and recycling
difficulties make this a more distant prospect, although the use of plastics
continues to increase steadily in other non-stress bearing applications.
With or without aluminium, 'downsizing' of cars is occurring across most
vehicle sectors as sophisticatedcomputer aided design and manufacturing
systems allow much better packaging of mechanical components, thus leaving
more room for occupants.
Mercedes is even investigating ways of making its top-range 'S' class models
appear smaller, following criticisms in some sections of the press that it
seems too much of an environmentally-unfriendly leviathan.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): The logic is impeccable -
Multi-Purpose Vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY call them multi-purpose vehicles, or MPVs for short, and their numbers
are growing fast because they are so practical. Buyers all over the world
have found that MPVs are like dishwashers and home laundries. Once you have
acquired one you find it hard to believe you ever managed to live without
it.
The logic behind the MPV is so impeccable it seems odd that cars were ever
made car-shaped instead of box-shaped. There is no better shape for a
container to put things - or for that matter, people - in than a box. It
combines maximum interior space with minimum external dimensions.
Could there be a better formula for a car to be driven and parked on
increasingly crowded roads? Why should a car's engine stick out in front, as
the horse did before mechanically propelled vehicles were invented?
Designing the 'three-box' car (bonnet, body and boot) was really a
retrograde step because the first horseless carriage had all the machinery
underneath.
But the first MPV was rear-engined. The VW Microbus of over 40 years ago was
a delivery van with three rows of seats and windows, powered by a
hard-worked VW Beetle engine under the boot. It was incredibly successful,
and so long lived that it has only been replaced within the last 10 years.
Since then, MPVs have largely left their commercial roots behind. They are
now like cars to drive, even though some still look rather van-like, being
essentially box-shaped.
Best known of the new generation of MPVs in Europe is the slant-nosed
Renault Espace that resembles a French TGV (train grand vitesse).
It seats up to seven, but takes up no more road or parking space than a Ford
Mondeo.
In a market segment that accounted for 1 per cent of total new car sales in
Western Europe last year and is projected to grow to 2 per cent in 1996 and
3 per cent by 2001, the Espace continues to dominate. The 56,317 units sold
last year (one in four of them turbo-diesel powered) accounted for exactly
50 per cent of the Euro-MPV market.
Next to Espace the most significant purpose-designed Euro-MPV, as distinct
from a panel van conversion, is the Nissan Serena. It is made in Spain,
where Nissan is half-way through a Dollars 1.4bn, five-year investment
programme running until 1996.
About 80 per cent of Serena's content is European. Current production
capacity is 205 units per day and the line is 50 per cent automated. If
demand rises, Nissan will install more robots to boost output.
But Espace and Serena are only the tip of a European MPV iceberg. Next year,
a vehicle jointly developed by Fiat and PSA and bearing a flattering
resemblance to the Renault Espace will enter the market.
The year after, a co-operative venture by VW and Ford will result in
production of a multi-purpose vehicle starting in Portugal.
Other European manufacturers with MPVs on the way include BMW and
Mercedes-Benz; Volvo (a joint effort with its partner, Renault); and Opel.
European producers appear to be contemplating a merging of function and
identity between the currently popular on-off road 4x4 vehicles and MPVs.
Few on-off road 4x4 owners ever contemplate seriously driving across country
 -not least because it is difficult to find anywhere to do so without
offending either the law or environmentalists, perhaps both.
Many of these 4x4s are bought to use as car alternatives by people who value
their high driving position, roominess and individual styling, and to whom
sheer off-road capability has very low priority.
Some may well want enough additional traction to cope with snowy hills or
crossing a muddy field but would not dream of driving over really rough
terrain.
For them, the ideal vehicle would be a tall MPV with four-wheel drive - such
as the Renault Espace Quadra or the Mitsubishi 4x4 Space Wagon. The current
boom in sales of 4x4s designed specifically as off-road vehicles could run
out of steam in the next few years, as manufacturers introduce on-road MPVs
with either selectable or full-time four wheel drive.
Japan has a number of MPVs in production, although not all of them come to
Europe. One that does come is the Toyota Previa, a purpose-designed MPV
which succeeded the original panel van-based Space Cruiser. Previa is a
little bigger overall than the Espace, seats up to eight people and has a
2.4-litre, 4-cylinder engine laid on its side and tucked away under the
floor.
Although strikingly spacious, it is not so big and bulky as to be difficult
to squeeze into a meter bay.
Although Europe, beginning with the VW Microbus of the 1950s, is the
ancestral home of the MPV, the US is where the concept has really taken off.
There they are called mini-vans, although by European standards they are
anything but mini-sized.
Nearly 4m units of Chrysler's Voyager mini-van (MPV) have been sold
worldwide since its launch in 1983, about 500,000 of them in the 1993 model
year just ending. It is the world's most popular MPV; for the last seven
years it has held more than 50 per cent of the mini-van market in the US.
Production of the Voyager began in Europe last year at the Eurostar plant in
Austria operated by Chrysler in partnership with Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG. This
year's scheduled output of 27,000 units is forecast to increase to 50,000 a
year in 1994-95. In two years time a new model with sliding passenger doors
on each side, instead of only one on the right hand side, will make the
production of right-hand steering versions for the UK market commercially
viable.
Ford's rival to the Chrysler Voyager is the Aerostar, launched in the US in
mid-1985 and - a foretaste of things to come in the European MPV market -
produced in two-wheel or four-wheel drive versions with 3-litre or 4-litre
V6 engines.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Conventional cars are
multiplying - All 1994 models are safer than the cars they will replace. The
industry has also been trying to minimise their impact on the environment /
New Models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN an ideal world, all the new cars which will make their debut at Frankfurt
and Tokyo motor shows would have been designed simply and solely as safe,
economical personal transport making the minimum impact on the environment.
Some of them have - although they are mainly concept cars which may or may
not go into production.
In the meantime, conventional cars with potential maximum speeds exploitable
only at rare intervals on the de-restricted parts of Germany's autobahnen
are alive and multiplying. The new Porsche 911 and Toyota's new Supra, which
is capable of 180 mph (290 kph) but restricted to a more seemly 155 mph
(250kph), prove that the supercar is surprisingly resistant to the
disapproval of the environmental/conservationist lobby.
To be sure, all 1994 models, be they European, American or Far Eastern, are
safer than the cars they will replace. And the industry has been going to
great lengths (and enormous expense) to minimise their environmental impact
during manufacture, for the whole of their working lives and when they are
finally scrapped.
Active safety has been enhanced by the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) which
have become standard equipment on medium and higher priced cars. Traction
control systems, using the same electronic sensors as ABS, are gradually
being introduced. Permanently engaged four-wheel drive is available on a
limited number of purely road-going cars for buyers who feel the need for
maximum possible tyre grip for performance or safety reasons.
On the passive safety front, reinforcing bars are now fitted to the cheapest
cars to limit intrusion into the passenger protecting cell in side-on
accidents. Buyers of executive-class cars now expect driver-side airbags as
standard equipment, with passenger-side airbags as not-too-expensive
optional extras.
ProCon Ten, an ingeniously simple mechanical system which pulls forward the
steering wheel in an impact severe enough to displace the engine backward
and simultaneously tightens the seat belts against driver and front
passenger remains exclusive to Audi. There are signs that it will be
abandoned in favour of airbags. The new VW Passat being launched at
Frankfurt has them as standard for both front seat occupants.
Impact-sensitive, self-tightening belts, however, are now common to most
makes of car.
Inevitably, improving the driver's chances of preventing a hazardous
situation from developing into a collision, and protecting a car's occupants
better if the worst should happen, has its downside.
Making new models crash-safer has increased their weight and complication.
To maintain or improve performance, particularly acceleration and easy
driveability in traffic, they are tending to have lower overall gearing,
which does not help fuel consumption.
The potentially adverse effects of heavier construction and lower gearing on
fuel consumption are being offset by improved electronic management systems
for petrol engines and the wider adoption of fuel-efficient diesel - and
particularly turbo-diesel - engines.
Volkswagen is showing at Frankfurt a management system which further
improves the economy of diesel cars by shutting off the fuel supply and
stopping the engine on downgrades. Saab's 900, its first new model since
General Motors took a controlling interest, is to be available - initially
only in the turbo version - with a Sensonic automatic clutch.
This system is a half-way house. The driver still has to change gear with a
conventional lever but there is no clutch pedal. Sensonic provides many of
the advantages of a conventional torque-converter automatic transmission
without any fuel consumption penalty. Eliminating the gear lever and
shifting by buttons on the steering wheel is the next step.
There are signs at Frankfurt - and there will be signs at Tokyo - that a
rash of really small cars is coming in the second half of this decade. New
models will be nearer to the Fiat Cinquecento and Japanese microcars in
overall size than existing small Europeans such as the British-made Nissan
Micra, the Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa, Renault Twingo and Rover 100 (Metro in
UK). Corsa and Micra have proved that in terms of performance, ride comfort
and general utility, the only thing distinguishing a really small car from a
medium sized one is its bulk.
Mercedes-Benz, whose Vision A 93 design study is a Frankfurt talking point,
speaks of growing demands by customers for cars of individuality and quality
that will be suitable for use in crowded conurbations but still capable of
longer journeys. BMW's 3.7 metre-long E1, designed for either
battery-electric or petrol-engine power, is similarly targeted. The Fiat
Cinquecento, seemingly parkable anywhere, does not feel in the least out of
its depth on a motorway; and it is on the market now.
Recognising that multi-cylinder buyers do not necessarily want a
conventionally large car has led General Motors to offer a 2.5 V6 engine in
its medium/large Opel Vectra (Vauxhall Cavalier), Calibra coupe and Saab
900. Especially when combined with automatic transmission, a small V6 is an
appealing package, as Japanese producers like Mazda realised earlier on.
Next year, Ford's successful Mondeo will go on sale with a US-made 2.5-litre
V6 engine and automatic transmission.
The civilised benefits of air conditioning have already spread from luxury
to executive cars. Now they are now begining to reach the broad base of the
European market, just as they did years ago in the US and Japan. At the same
time, the convertible market is booming, with Peugeot launching its 306 and
Volkswagen its new Golf soft-tops at Frankfurt and Saab promising a new 900
cabriolet by the spring of 1994.
Just as the BX propelled Citroen into the mainstream European car market in
the early 1980s, the Xantia which has just succeeded the BX is proving a
powerful challenger in the fleet market traditionally dominated by Ford and
GM products. It is an outstanding car, widely tipped as a likely European
Car of the Year 1994 contest winner. It combines a roomy though elegantly
styled body with advanced self-levelling suspension and refined diesel and
turbo-diesel engines.
In the luxury class, Rolls-Royce has squeezed more power from its venerable
V8, while Mercedes-Benz, aware of a trend among business buyers away from
very large cars with very large engines, has introduced a 2.8- litre,
six-cylinder version of the S-Class.
Some versions of its new C-Class saloons, which have been aimed at younger
than traditional Mercedes-Benz buyers, have the world's first
four-valves-per-cylinder diesel engines. Although they have been on sale for
some weeks in Europe, they are making their first show appearance at
Frankfurt.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (23): Focus on weight reduction
 -It is almost certain that carmakers will employ both materials much more
extensively in future, particularly in the US / Magnesium vs Aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GETTING your retaliation in first is a well-tried battle tactic.
Mercedes-Benz is aware how effective this can be - and therefore its latest
shots in the increasingly hostile European car wars involved a paean to
magnesium metal.
Mercedes suggested that magnesium had big advantages over steel, aluminium
and plastics for car producers needing to reduce the weight of vehicles. And
certainly that is what producers are concentrating on today because weight
reduction is the single most effective way to cut fuel consumption.
The German company's statement was obviously designed as a 'spoiling'
exercise ahead of an October Press briefing by its rival Audi, the up-market
part of the Volkswagen group, extolling the virtues of aluminium in cars.
Audi is soon to launch an 'aluminium-intensive', top-of-the-range V8 saloon
which it developed along with the Aluminium Company of America.
'This is our most important project,' says Mr Franz-Joseph Kortum, Audi's
chairman, of the DM1bn venture. 'We are trying for a second time for success
in this segment of the car market and this is a great challenge for the
company. But we will set new standards in this segment. We have changed the
rule that says the bigger and better the car, the heavier it must be.
'It is true that cars generally have improved enormously, but the weight has
increased enormously, too.' He says the new Audi will offer drivers 'a new
experience because of its light weight, stiffness and rigidity and safety.'
Many will find its performance and low fuel consumption astonishing, he
predicts. 'And this is because it is build of aluminium.'
BMW also chipped in with the news that it has signed a co-operative
agreement with Hydro Aluminium of Norway for the development of aluminium
components - possibly even the production of complete 'space frames,'
skeleton-like frames to which body panels can be fixed. But BMW said it had
no plans for volume production of an entire aluminium-intensive car such as
Audi's.
Nevertheless, BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an aluminium space frame in
its prototype E1 electric vehicle for California. At the Geneva Motor Show
this year, the group presented the Z13 concept 'city car', which has an
aluminium frame, recycled plastic panels, and a motor-cycle engine.
Hydro, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group, this year
started supplying aluminium space frames from a Michigan factory for General
Motors' new Corvette sports. It has also been co-operating on car
space-frame concepts since the mid-1980s with various groups, including
Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy.
Yet Mercedes intervention is a timely reminder that the automotive industry
is interested in metals other than aluminium. And the automotive sector is
expected to play a big role in magnesium's future.
According to Mining Journal's annual review, in 1991 there were nearly 40
magnesium components already in production for US and Canadian cars,
compared with only one 10 years previously.
At the Institute de la Technologie du Magnesium, in Santa-Foy, Quebec, which
specialises in contract research and development work, half the members are
Japanese while the US automotive industry is represented by General Motors.
An average of 4.5lb of magnesium per car was used in North America in 1990
and the Cadillac North Star engine, launched last year, uses 15lb of the
metal.
While this trend is particularly important for the use of magnesium in
die-casting, extrusions are also set to become competitive and magnesium is
already the choice for a growing number of structural automotive uses such
as road wheels, seat frames, housings and valve covers.
Although it is one of the lightest metals available for automotive design
engineering, magnesium displays outstanding strength-to-weight and
stiffness-to-weight ratios. Its proponents also say the metal has superior
damping qualities to absorb noise and vibration and it is the easiest of all
structural metals to machine. Mercedes commented on this aspect: 'Magnesium
has the advantage compared with aluminium in that it can be better processed
in many ways and consequently can be cheaper in the end.'
Mercedes pointed out that new high-purity alloying processes can offset
magnesium's traditional disadvantages to a carmaker - its relatively high
price, poor corrosion resistance, low strength and inability to keep its
shape in warm conditions. Magnesium alloys reach the required elasticity
levels of up to 10 per cent without costly heat treatment, it added.
The group has been working with a foundry specialist on a new thin-wall
pressure casting technique which allows a 40 per cent reduction in material
thickness. This 'opens up a new spectrum of possibilities for the use of
magnesium.'
Mercedes has been using magnesium seat frames for its SL Roadster since 1989
and said it had 'favourable experience' in using it in bodywork, too. But Mr
Werner Heiss, of Mercedes' pre-development trials division, said it was
unlikely the metal would be used for engine blocks in water-cooled engines.
'Consistent use' of magnesium could reduce a car's weight by 10 per cent, he
said.
Mercedes pointed out that it would not be difficult for the world to produce
enough magnesium, no matter how much the carmakers eventually required, and
that the metal could easily be recycled.
Mercedes' attempt to place magnesium in competition with aluminium is a
little puzzling given that its small concept car at the Frankfurst Show will
be the Vision A93 which has a body, fuel tank and seat frames made of
aluminium. And in many ways the metals complement one another - a great deal
of magnesium is already used in aluminium alloys.
It is almost certain that carmakers will employ both materials much more
extensively in future, particularly in the US where they have to meet
government-imposed fuel economy targets but the market shows customers do
not want very small cars.
For example, Ford not so long ago announced plans to install North America's
first-ever car seat stanchions made of magnesium. Yet the US's
second-largest vehicles group is also using more aluminium than the rest of
the American motor industry combined - about 16m tonnes a year.
Mr Kenneth Kohrs, Ford's vice-president of car product development, has been
standing up for the aluminium-intensive car. He revealed that Ford was
testing a fleet of 20 Mercury Sable cars made mostly of aluminium as part of
a Dollars 25m effort to see whether volume production of an
aluminium-intensive car was feasible. He said the experimental Sables each
weighed 400lb less than an identical version made of steel.
Ford has also developed the Synthesis 2010, about the same size as the Sable
but which achieves weight savings of about 1,000lb. The Synthesis, 'a
rolling test bed for new technologies,' is powered by an aluminium,
three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US
aluminium producer, and Alacan of Canada, the western world's second-largest
aluminium producer, have both been working with Ford on its aluminium
projects.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (21): Cheaper won helps exports
 -South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S car industry is once again enjoying an export boom after
several years of lagging sales abroad.
The rapid improvement is largely a due to increased price competitiveness
resulting from a cheaper Korean won, which has fallen by almost 20 per cent
against the Japanese yen since the beginning of the year.
Car exports during the first eight months of 1993 rose by 37 per cent to
358,000 vehicles and would have been still higher if a series of strikes
between May and July had not disrupted production at Hyundai Motor, the
country's largest carmaker and biggest motor exporter.
There is growing optimism that exports may reach 560,000 vehicles this year,
close to the previous export peak of 576,000 units in 1988.
Exports have slumped during the past four years as the appreciation of the
won and higher labour costs has pushed the price of Korean cars higher.
Complaints about product quality in the late 1980s contributed to a big fall
in sales in the US, the main export market.
The drop in exports underscored the Korean carmakers' overwhelming
dependency on the North American market - which accounted for 80 per cent of
foreign sales in 1988 - and convinced them to diversify their markets
abroad.
North America remains the single largest overseas market, but its share of
total foreign sales has fallen to 28 per cent this year.
The Asia Pacific region has recently emerged as the second largest market,
with a 26 per cent share, with China buying large numbers of Korean cars.
But China's recently imposed ban on car imports to slow consumer spending
has provoked worries that sales there may fall sharply.
The biggest disappointment has been Europe. Hyundai in particular has
concentrated on expansion in Europe during the past few years and the region
overtook the US last year as the company's biggest export market.
The recession caused Korean car sales in Europe to fall by 9.4 per cent this
year, and reduced the region's share of exports to 23 per cent, against a
14.3 per cent increase for North America and a 98.9 per cent jump in Asia.
The general improvement in exports is encouraging news for Kia Motor and
Daewoo Motor, Korea's second- and third-largest carmakers respectively, as
they try to challenge Hyundai's dominance in foreign markets. Hyundai
normally accounts for two-thirds of Korean car exports.
Until recently, both Kia and Daewoo have largely relied on supplying cars to
other companies on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis for most
of their exports. Kia produces the Fiesta for Ford, while Daewoo
manufactures the LeMans for General Motors (GM).
But the two are now venturing into foreign markets on their own. Kia is
establishing an independent sales network in the US and recruiting local
dealers in Europe.
Daewoo, which ended its joint venture with GM last year in order to free
itself from restrictions on overseas marketing activity, is initially
concentrating on sales in the developing world. It plans to expand into the
US and Europe once the GM-imposed marketing restrictions lapse next year.
The two companies are also setting up factories, mainly in Asia and the
Middle East, to assemble cars supplied in knock-down kit form.
The sharp rise in exports comes at an opportune moment for the Korean car
industry, which is confronting tougher market conditions at home.
Domestic sales, which account for almost 75 per cent of total Korean motor
sales, grew by 10.5 per cent during the first seven months of 1993 - much
slower than the average annual rate of 40 per cent registered over the past
six years.
As the economy stumbles, consumer confidence has weakened. Carmakers are
spending more on marketing and sales efforts to reverse the downward trend,
while offering consumers generous financing terms that are placing further
pressure on profit margins.
The strikes affecting Hyundai, however, have benefited Kia and Daewoo, with
both reporting higher sales during the first half of the year. Kia posted a
48 per cent rise in net profits to Won5.2bn (Pounds 4.3m) while Hyundai's
net profits tumbled by 41 per cent to Won15.4bn.
While the Big Three car producers are engaged in fierce competition in the
compact and medium-size car segments, other companies associated with them
have been successful in developing specialised niches, particularly in
mini-cars and four wheel drive jeeps. These are the fastest-growing areas of
the Korean motor market.
Daewoo Shipbuilding began producing mini-cars in 1991. Its success is
encouraging Hyundai Precision to enter the market at the end of year, using
technology supplied by Mitsubishi of Japan. Kia is also considering
producing mini-cars.
Hyundai Precision, which also manufactures containers and tanks, began
production of jeeps in 1991. Its Galloper jeep has cut into the sales of
Ssangyong Motor, which is Korea's biggest jeep producer.
Ssangyong, which suffered losses of Won8.8bn last year because of the
challenge posed by Hyundai Precision, has responded by diversifying into
passenger cars.
Earlier this year, it signed an agreement with Mercedes-Benz to begin
production of a new range of medium and luxury cars in 1996.
The luxury car segment is rapidly becoming an area of competition among
Korean carmakers. Hyundai and Kia already produce luxury car models and
Daewoo is expected to join the field by the end of the year with a domestic
version of Honda's Legend.
The passenger vehicle market is in danger of becoming even more crowded with
Samsung indicating that it wants to manufacture cars within the next few
years.
Although some analysts question whether Korea can support nine manufacturers
of cars and commercial vehicles, the expansion is being encouraged by the
government.
Under its X-5 programme, the government is planning to make Korea one of the
world's five biggest vehicle manufacturers by 2000. Korea is already the
seventh-largest in terms of production, with 1.73m vehicles manufactured
last year.
The government estimates that it will cost Dollars 36bn to implement the X-5
programme, with 60 per cent of this devoted to factory expansion and the
remainder consisting of research spending in such areas as electric cars.
The programme is largely funded by soft state loans.
'It's nuts,' said one Seoul-based western industry consultant. 'The danger
is that Korea is heading toward excessive production capacity.
'It may soon find its Asian market weakening as China builds it own cars.
Sales at home could also stagnate because the nation's roads are becoming
clogged with traffic and it may not be able to handle much more.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Too quiet for comfort -
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a Mitsubishi Motors showroom in Tokyo, visitors last month were sent home
with a gift bag full of vegetables. Not to be outdone, the nearby Nissan
dealer was offering prospective customers a bag of firecrackers and a yo-yo.
Car dealers in Japan are having a quiet season. Last year, for the first
time since the second world war, the Japanese car market experienced its
second consecutive year of decline. The odds are increasing that the record
will be extended to three consecutive years of decline unless the Japanese
economy unexpectedly lifts itself out of its gloom.
In the first six months of this year, domestic demand for cars shrank 6.6
per cent, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association
(Jama). After an early jump in sales in March - which proved a false
warning, activity in the market has returned to the sluggish state that has
become all too familiar in the past few years.
Although the Japanese government is holding firm on its forecast that the
economy will see a gradual pickup towards the latter part of the fiscal
year, the continuing weakness of personal consumption and private capital
investment are casting a dark shadow over that projection.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, admitted last month that, given the
current state of the economy and the sharp rise of the yen, the company
might have to revise downward its production target for the year.
The Japanese car industry's troubles are not restricted to the home market.
Overseas, Japanese carmakers are coming under severe pressure as a result of
the sharp advance of the yen's value against the dollar. One Japanese
manufacturer after another has had to raise prices overseas, particularly in
the US, to try to salvage what profits they can, as the yen continues its
surge.
This has damaged their price advantage at a time when US manufacturers are
increasingly challenging the competitive edge Japanese carmakers have had
with their better-made cars. In the first three months of this year, the
Japanese makers' share of the US market slipped to 27 per cent from 30 per
cent.
The political environment also makes it difficult for Japanese carmakers to
seek to make up in exports the slack in domestic demand. As the Big Three US
companies have brushed up their manufacturing, they have also stepped up
political pressure to keep Japanese carmakers at bay, as well as force Japan
to open its market more to US-made cars and car parts. They have tried to
get the US government to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made minivans by
claiming that Japanese carmakers 'dump' their vans in the US. At the same
time they have increased political pressure on the Japanese auto industry to
buy more foreign-made car parts.
In the EC, calls to curb the Japanese onslaught are no less intense. The
European Commission is negotiating with the Japanese government to scale
back an agreed target for Japanese car imports into the Community in 1993.
Hopes have been pinned on the Asian market. However, even exports to China
(a growing market) have been reduced this year as a result of the adverse
effect of the yen's appreciation and a tightening of monetary policy by the
Chinese authorities intent on cooling down their economy.
The pressures facing the Japanese industry would have seemed less
intractable were it not for the structural nature of many of the problems.
The outlook for Japan's carmakers is now radically different from the years
of strong growth, in the late 1980s, which led them to invest heavily in the
latest production technology and expand rapidly abroad.
In contrast to those days, the industry is today gripped by the recognition
that there is an overcapacity in the global car market. For example, in
Japan at the end of March last year, according to Jama, 87.3 per cent of
households owned a car. Against that background, Mr Yoshihiro Wada,
president of Mazda, expects growth in the industrialised world's car markets
to be less than 1 per cent. Slower growth means that carmakers can no longer
afford to supply a full range of models and compete with each other in every
category. There needs to be a division of labour, Mr Wada says.
That is already beginning to happen in Japan. The high and rising costs of
development are bringing Japanese rivals together.
Isuzu, a leading truck and commercial vehicle maker, is pulling out of
passenger car production and buying cars from Honda. In exchange it is
supplying Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu is also supplying Mazda
with diesel engines. Meanwhile, Mazda and Nissan are negotiating about the
possibility of swapping trucks and vans.
Although Japanese and US carmakers have been making cars together for years,
the growing links in the domestic market - where rivalries are fierce -
reflect the heightened sense of urgency within the industry. The trend is
likely to accelerate further. The urgent need to address environmental
issues, to raise fuel efficiency and improve safety measures all require
that carmakers bring their resources together, says Mr Junji Shibata,
general manager of the European and North American Operations Group at
Nissan.
'One of the key issues that the managers of carmakers will have to tackle in
the future is how to maintain individuality within these alliances,' says Mr
Taizo Yokoyama, managing director of Mitsubishi Motors.
In the meantime, the Japanese industry is focusing its efforts on
readjusting operations to suit the changed market environment. Carmakers are
increasingly standardising parts in an effort to cut costs and develop
cheaper cars that will cater to the more cost-consciousness Japanese
consumer.
But perhaps the greater challenge for Japanese carmakers lies in adjusting
to a market that is already mature.
Nissan shocked the nation when it announced earlier this year that it was
closing a plant in the outskirts of Tokyo. Others may be forced to take
similar measures to deal with their overcapacity. Mazda and Toyota, for
example, built up considerable capacity in the boom years of the late 1980s.
While plant closures and redundancies have a high social cost in Japan, the
Japanese car industry probably has little choice but to shrink - unless new
demand can be tapped in outside markets.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Trickle turns into a
torrent - China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese motor vehicle market and industry is currently one of the
world's most dynamic automotive sectors. During the 1980s, several Chinese
companies concluded licensing agreements with foreign vehicle manufacturers
for the local assembly of selected models.
Joint ventures with foreign companies also began to make their appearance in
a trickle of deals which has recently turned into a torrent. There has been
what has, at times, looked almost like a rush by western vehicle
manufacturers to put down a marker in the rapidly-growing (and potentially
very rich) Chinese market for all types of vehicles.
The Chinese government has welcomed this process, with Mr Li Peng, the
Chinese premier, citing vehicle manufacture as one of the four central
pillars of Chinese industry. Technology transfer is actively sought; China
is eager to learn from the expertise of the world's vehicle multinationals.
The sector is very highly fragmented, with a large number of relatively
small-scale operations likely to characterise the industry for the 1990s.
This situation will surely start to change early in the next century,
however, given the strength of the vehicle market where growth prospects
seem virtually limitless. An equally important influence is the rapid growth
of the Chinese economy and the liberalisation of economic and certain
political attitudes, for example towards the creation of wealth and the
personal ownership of the means of production.
Not only will larger-scale vehicle manufacturing plants probably start to
make their appearance in strength, but it is probable China will seek -
either through the state or private-sector interests - to develop a truly
indigenous motor vehicle design and manufacturing industry.
Throughout the 1990s, the sector will concentrate on boosting output,
improving efficiency and profitability, raising economies of scale and
upgrading managerial and blue collar expertise and skills.
Comprehensive figures for the levels of vehicle production and sales for any
year in China are extremely difficult to come by, with assessments based on
individual company releases and on the information put out by the China
National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC).
Two things are clear, however. One is the rapid growth in passenger car and
commercial vehicle production and sales in recent years. According to CNAIC,
output last year reached 120,000 cars - excluding the Daihatsu Charade which
is also assembled in China, and Beijing Jeep's aged 2020 four-wheel-drive
vehicle - and 960,000 commercial vehicles. The other is that the sector will
expand throughout the 1990s.
The recently published Financial Times management report, The Emerging
Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry: Growth and Opportunities from South Korea
to Turkey, which examines the industry in depth, is forecasting that Chinese
output of passenger cars could rise to 1.9m units by 2002, and that of
commercial vehicles to 1.6m units.
The potential size of the market explains the scramble since the start of
the 1990s by western and Japanese vehicle manufacturers to establish or
expand production, assembly or licensing business in China.
Germany's Volkswagen group is in the process of increasing its level of
investment. It has entered into two important joint ventures. The first is
the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company, which in early 1992 announced
that it was to increase annual output substantially at its Shanghai facility
by 1995. The second is the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, which is
constructing a plant in Jilin province, scheduled to come on stream by 1995.
The second-largest carmaker in China is France's PSA group, which has two
joint ventures. The first is Guangzhou Peugeot which assembles the 505 in
the south of China, and the second, SAW Citroen Auto, which in the autumn of
1992 began to assemble the Citroen ZX hatchback.
Among other European vehicle manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz has interests in
the commercial vehicle sector in China, while Italy's Iveco has a tie-up
with Nanjing Motor for the production of light trucks.
Two of America's Big Three are building a strong presence. Chrysler has a
shareholding in the Beijing Jeep Company, which manufactures the Cherokee
four-wheel-drive vehicle. At the start of 1992 General Motors formed a joint
venture with the Chinese van and light truck producer, Jinbei Automotive.
Most Japanese carmakers have already concluded joint ventures or technical
assistance agreements in China. These ventures include Zhengzhou Nissan
Automobile, the Hainan Mazda Motor and Stamping Company, the Jiangling-Isuzu
Motors Company, the Changan Suzuki Automobile Company and the Shenyang
Jinbei Passenger Vehicle Manufacturing Company, in which Toyota is in
partnership with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings.
In addition, Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy Industries have technical assistance
agreements with Chinese vehicle manufacturers. Other Asian vehicle producers
are also eyeing opportunities in China. These include South Korea's Kia
Motors, which has announced a joint venture for the assembly of passenger
cars and components in Yanji City.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (20): An important force -
South-East Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE south-east Asian region, encompassing South Korea, Taiwan and the Asean
block, has become an important force within the global automotive industry,
and is providing the world's vehicle and components manufacturers with some
of the strongest growth rates and most substantial business opportunities to
be found anywhere in the world.
During the 1990s the current boom in vehicle output is set to continue apace
in the wake of rapidly-growing local demand and the development by a number
of companies of important export markets. From a total output across the
region of 2.9m vehicles in 1992 (1.9m passenger cars and 1m commercial
vehicles) production is expected to increase substantially into the early
years of the next century and beyond.
The recently-published Financial Times Management Report, The Emerging
Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry: Growth and Opportunities from South Korea
to Turkey, which examines this sector in some depth is, for example,
forecasting that by the year 2002 some 4.6m passenger cars and 2.8m
commercial vehicles a year could be produced in South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
According to this report, particularly strong growth is identified as likely
in the automotive industries of Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines (in the
latter country from a very small base level of a few tens of thousands of
units) for the 10-year period up to the year 2002.
Growth in South Korean vehicle manufacturing is also likely to be
substantial over the next decade - especially if plans by one or more
participants in that industry for the establishment of overseas plants come
to fruition.
Vietnam, which is expected to enjoy rapid economic growth in the foreseeable
future, is also expected to emerge as a producer.
So far, the motor vehicle industries of Taiwan and the Asean block have been
largely dominated by Japanese multinationals,
although opportunities have existed for American and European automakers,
and will, indeed, continue to present themselves over the coming years.
Of Taiwan's current tally of 10 vehicle manufacturers in early 1993, eight
assemble Japanese makes and three American or European models. One company,
Yeu Tyan Machinery Manufacturing, assembles both Daihatsu and Peugeot
vehicles. Despite heavy Japanese involvement in the Taiwanese automotive
industry, however, Ford has, managed to develop the leading position within
this sector.
In 1992, the Ford Lio Ho Motor Company, in which Ford Motor Company has a
majority shareholding, accounted for more than a quarter of total vehicle
output in Taiwan, and is planning an increase in production in the 1980s.
Another western opportunity in Taiwan is in the process of being realised:
Volkswagen vans are to be produced by the Ching Chung Motor Company from
late 1993.
In Thailand, several makes of European vehicles are assembled in modest
quantities by local companies, although General Motors is thought to be
considering the re-commencement of assembly operations in conjunction with
the Bangchan General Assembly Company. GM withdrew in 1978 from assembly in
that country. The excellent potential of the Thai motor vehicle market could
lead several other western carmakers to re-evaluate opportunities.
As in Thailand, the Malaysian motor vehicle assembly sector is almost
totally dominated by Japanese models, although seven European makes of
passenger car, and one American, were assembled in 1992 in very low
quantities. Several other such operations are currently either starting up
or planned. In addition, the official first and second national car projects
involve respectively Mitsubishi and Daihatsu - although it is not
inconceivable that an opportunity for a western luxury car manufacturer
could present itself at some stage in the future, should a third national
car project ever be formulated.
The position in Indonesia is little different from that in Thailand and
Malaysia, although General Motors has been negotiating with two local
companies for the establishment of further vehicle assembly agreements.
Within the small vehicle assembly industry of the Philippines, Mercedes-Benz
in March 1993 received approval from the Board of Investments for the
assembly of two models by the Commercial Motors Corporation under the
newly-opened luxury car category of the car development programme.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (17):  Fighting comeback
against old enemy - The American buying public recognises improved design
and quality / North America, The big three
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICA'S three biggest car companies are making a fighting come-back. They
have regained more than 2 per cent of the US vehicle market from Japan,
their 'old enemy', this year, following 1992's small improvement over 1991.
While Japanese car makers are handicapped by the strengthening yen, there is
increasing public recognition that the design and quality of General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler products have improved considerably. The result is that
sales for the Big Three at the expense of Japan are looking up - although
none of the American makers thinks the job is complete.
'We're not where we'd like to be (on quality),' says Robert A. Lutz,
Chrysler's president.
But his company is making the biggest impact in the showrooms, thanks to
several well-received new model introductions which include the revised
Voyager minivan (a trend-setter and class leader), Jeep Grand Cherokee and
the LH range of saloons known as Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler
Concorde. The Escort-sized Neon saloon will make its debut at this month's
Frankfurt motor show, and will be followed shortly by the muscular Ram
pick-up and medium-size JA saloons. And the outrageous, low-volume Viper
sports car did wonders for Chrysler's rather dowdy image.
So far, the new vehicles have helped to shoot Chrysler from a market share
of just over 12 per cent in 1991 to more than 15 per cent by the end of June
this year. In a gradually improving market, this means that Chrysler sales
in the first half of this year were up by more than a quarter compared with
the same period last year.
It is no wonder that Chrysler is a Wall Street favourite once more. Its
financial results this year have been good - helped by disposals of a
component company and by Chrysler's remaining stake in Mitsubishi Motors.
The more 'global' companies, GM and Ford, are presently handicapped by their
overseas operations, particularly in the wake of the unprecedented slump in
western European car demand. Chrysler has benefited from a concentration of
its business in North America. This is typical of the company's boom-or-bust
history: the ups and downs in Chrysler's fortunes are much more marked than
at Ford or GM, companies which are bigger and slower to change.
Ford recognised the Japanese challenge much earlier than either of its
rivals. It began restructuring a decade ago, gradually improving its
efficiency, quality and market share. The company - financially the
strongest of the Big Three - is also on a roll.
Ford overtook GM's Chevrolet as the leading nameplate in the US some time
ago. Five of America's 10 best-selling vehicles are Fords, including the top
truck (F-series) and the top car (Taurus). Ford hopes that the North
American versions of Mondeo, which will be known as Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique, will join the best-selling list when they go on sale next year.
In contrast to Ford, GM appeared to believe until recently that its great
size rendered it impervious to changing conditions. But its steadily
worsening market share, accompanied by a deterioration in its financial
performance, prompted last year's shareholder revolt.
Like Chrysler in the mid-1980s and Ford in the early 1980s, GM is embarked
on a thorough overhaul of its policies, processes and products  - under Mr
Jack Smith, GM president since last November.
For the first time in GM history, the chairman (now Mr John Smale) is not
involved in the corporation's daily operations. Mr Smith is unlike all
previous top executives at GM. A hands-on man who is credited with creating
the corporation's successful European operations, he has moved his office
from GM's palatial Detroit headquarters to the more modest technical centre
in nearby Warren.
GM once built one out of every two cars bought by Americans. It now builds
one in three, thanks to competition from Ford, Chrysler and Japanese
carmakers, and clearly has more factories than it needs, especially in the
wake of efficiency improvements. The adjustment will be a long and painful
one: 23 plants are on the closure list.
Mr Smith vows that reform will not be side-tracked by issues such as the
controversial defection to Volkswagen, earlier this year, of Mr Ignacio
Lopez, GM's purchasing chief. Mr Lopez was in charge of North American
automotive operations, the group's principle area of concern. This made a
net loss of Dollars 95m in the first half of this year, although Mr Rick
Wagoner, the chief financial officer, says it will break even before charges
for the whole year - a notable improvement on the Dollars 11bn losses
recorded during 1991-92.
It will mean continuing the cost-reduction work, begun by Mr Lopez, on
bought-in components. Mr Wagoner says the group will have lopped Dollars 4bn
 -more than 10 per cent - from its North American supplier bill by the end
of this year.
One real problem for GM at present is a lack of blockbuster new models that
customers really want - for example, models such as the Chrysler LH series
or Ford's Explorer four-wheel-drive. But the corporation has high hopes for
next year's new Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Aurora.
GM designers say they have learned from recent history, when look-alike
styling contributed to falling market share and in-house brands competed
with each other rather than with their real rivals from Ford and Chrysler.
The bright spot for GM is its Saturn division, which increased sales by 25
percent this year. But Saturn,
which absorbed billions of dollars, is a comparatively cheap, low-volume
model. As it can never earn the profit margins of larger cars and trucks, GM
needs to repeat its results across many other models as well.
Longer term, the corporation is understood to be planning a full range of
models with many fewer chassis-platform variations. The challenge will be to
give distinctive character to cars built off the same components.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (18): Optimism remains despite
sharp slowdown - Most car companies assume that economic growth will pick up
/ Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER steady growth over the past five years, Mexico's car and truck
industry is now suffering from the country's sharp economic slowdown.
In the five months to May, domestic and export sales reached 445,768; a drop
of 3.1 per cent on the same period last year. The market had been expecting
growth of at least 5 per cent, after last year's increase of 8.8 per cent,
and double-digit growth of previous years.
The contraction is largely due to a 22.5 per cent reduction in van and lorry
sales as small and large businesses have cut purchases in an environment of
low economic growth. Car sales increased by a modest 3 per cent, while
exports were flat.
The reduction comes just as Mexico's car industry is preparing itself for
the North American Free Trade Agreement, scheduled to come into force by
January 1 1994. The treaty is likely to intensify the integration of
Mexico's car industry with those of the US and Canada, enabling car
companies to rationalise plants in the Americas, concentrating production in
the most efficient factories in the region.
Under Nafta, Mexico will gradually dismantle barriers to imports, breaking
the complex link between permitted imports into Mexico and a car company's
exports and domestic sales. But the US will eventually eliminate its 25 per
cent tariff on light trucks, its 2.5 per cent tariff on Mexican cars, and
consider Mexican cars as North American for purposes of CAFE, a regulation
that encourages car makers to make fuel-efficient vehicles in the US or
Canada.
On one level, the removal of Mexican trade barriers means that US car
companies will likely take advantage of economies of scale in US plants, and
excess capacity, by exporting from the US to Mexico. New US exports to
Mexico could hurt Volkswagen and Nissan which between them control the
compact and sub-compact market in Mexico. GM reckons that as a result of
greater US exports to Mexico, the US automotive deficit with Mexico of about
Dollars 2bn a year will turn to a surplus.
In June, General Motors gave a possible signal of events to come when it
announced it was going to move production of US and Canadian-bound Cavaliers
from Ramos Arizpe to Lansing, Michigan.
But Mexico's low wages, special status under Nafta, and the high
productivity of its workers make it an attractive location for new plants.
GM has said it might start production of a compact car in its Ramos Arzipe
factory, and Mercedes-Benz is exploring the possibility of exporting luxury
cars to the US from Mexico.
Volkswagen has no factory in the US, and eventually expects to supply part
of the US market from Mexican plants rather than, as now, from those in
Germany. Other non-US companies, such as Honda and Toyota, may also set up
in Mexico to take advantage of its access to the US.
Nafta also forces car companies to meet a stiff North American rule of
origin requirement of 62.5 per cent. While the US companies easily meet this
target, VW and Nissan are having to persuade German and Japanese parts
suppliers to set up in Mexico so as to comply.
Troubles in the car industry have caused lay-offs and provoke talk of a
crisis. On June 15, Ford Mexico fired 680 workers after it cut back
production at a plant in northern Mexico City from about 500 to 400 vehicles
a day. When announcing the cut-back, Ford said it had been expecting
industry domestic sales of 720,000 this year, but it now reckons sales will
be about 600,000.
The car companies are blaming weak sales on high interest rates, which have
cut demand for credit, and the newly privatised banks which, after seeing a
rapid increase in underperforming loans, have become much more cautious in
giving out loans.
The elimination of tax deductibility for company vehicles last year also
seems to be having an impact.
The worse performing companies have been the US Big Three - Ford, General
Motors and Chrysler - partly because they are the biggest producers of
trucks and vans, and also because they have not recently invested heavily in
new capacity. In the first five months, domestic sales at Chrysler fell 24.2
per cent, at GM by 14.6 per cent, and at Ford by 11.4 per cent. Volkswagen,
boosted by sales of its new Jetta, improved by 17.1 per cent, and Nissan was
up by 4.5 per cent.
Exports have held up better, thanks to the recovery of the US economy and
increased capacity. Nissan has started exporting from its new Aguascalientes
plant, pushing exports up by 80 per cent, while VW exports increased by 18.1
per cent. However Ford, last year the largest exporter, saw exports fall by
13 per cent and has had to eliminate shifts at its Hermosillo export plant,
which produces Escorts and Mercurys for the US market.
Despite this year's problems, the car companies are still optimistic about
prospects in Mexico because most assume that economic growth will pick up
from the lucklustre 2.4 per cent of the first quarter this year, and
interest rates will continue falling.
The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts domestic sales will reach 1.1m by
1996 from 706,914 last year. Exports are predicted to rise to
600,000-700,000; almost double last year's figure of 383,374.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (16): Slide becomes more
pronounced - Nissan and tiny Isuzu manage to steer clear of the downward
trend - and gain market share / The Japanese in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVENTS of the past year demonstrate that Japan's carmakers are not
invincible in the US. Many observers, following their performance in America
during the previous two decades, were beginning to think they were.
Japanese car brands - imports as well as those made locally - finished last
year with an American market share of 30.1 per cent. Their slice of the
total vehicle market, which includes pick-up trucks, off-roaders and
people-carriers, was 24.3 per cent.
Both kinds of market share were down, marginally, from the previous year's,
but the slide became more pronounced during the first half of this year,
when Japanese nameplates accounted for 27.6 per cent of the car market -
21.9 per cent overall. It was their worst performance in five years.
Japan's only good news came from Nissan and tiny Isuzu: both gained market
share against the trend. Even Honda, America's darling during much of the
1980s, faltered, as the Accord slipped from number one to fourth in the car
popularity stakes.
Not that European brands fared any better. Combined sales dropped more than
15 per cent in the first half of the year, and now account for little more
than 2 per cent of the total US vehicle market. In other words, Japan
outsells Europe in the US in a ratio of almost 10:1.
Overall, the drop in Japanese car sales was much too large to be a
statistical quirk. While Detroit's Big Three, General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler, between them found more than half a million more new customers in
the first half-year compared with one year earlier, Japanese companies lost
almost 15,000 sales.
This is a particularly challenging period for Japanese car makers. The poor
returns in the US come against a background of sluggish sales in Japan
itself and a dramatic fall in demand in Europe. With the exception of sales
to Latin America and south-east Asia, Japanese vehicle exports everywhere
are stalled.
At the same time, Japanese companies are committed to a costly build-up of
transplant factories in North America and Europe. In the wake of the yen's
apparently ceaseless appreciation, they may prove a long term salvation to
some of the US's problems, by reducing its dependence on exports.
The yen is hovering at about 100 to the dollar, compared with about 125 one
year ago. While exporters managed to cope with adjusting from 250 yen to the
dollar of the mid-1980s, the latest exchange rates are proving too much,
even for a successful and wealthy company such as Toyota.
It is easy to see what that degree of swing will do to prices of direct
imports from Japan. But it also affects vehicles made by Japanese companies
in the US. Many of their components are still imported.
The rising yen will be a further incentive for Japanese companies to honour
a commitment to raise the local component content of their American-made
vehicles from about 55 per cent to 70 per cent.
Japanese vehicle prices in the US are beginning to reflect the yen's
strength, although the fight for customers in the market place means that
actual purchase prices are a good deal closer to those of American products
than the list prices suggest.
Consumer belief that Japanese models are much more expensive than those of
GM, Ford and Chrysler, contributed to the resurgence in Big Three sales. So
did the distinct shift in public attitude about buying US products. Now that
many Americans are hostile towards Japanese trade policies, it is almost
chic to buy US cars these days.
On the other hand, the US come-back is masked by the large proportion of
fleet sales, perhaps more than a quarter of the total. This traditionally
low - or zero - profit business is almost the Big Three's exclusive
preserve.
Japanese companies say their largely retail business has held up well. They
also point to the slower economies along the west coast, where the Japanese
have historically been strongest. Those regions are suffering in the wake of
recent defence cuts.
Nevertheless, the shift to US brands is understandable because the country's
car companies responded positively to Japanese competitive pressure in the
1980s. Detroit made quantifiable improvements in vehicle quality in recent
years, described in surveys by the independent JD Power market research
group. While Japanese brands still come top of Power's annual initial
quality and customer satisfaction surveys, US models are coming much closer.
'Quality is not an issue any more,' says a Power spokesman.
Nissan's counter-trend improvement in sales stemmed largely from the
addition of two new models, both of which are made in the us. Sales of other
Nissans reflected the more general Japanese trend. The new Nissans are the
Altima, a saloon manufactured at Smyrna, in Tennessee, and the Quest
minivan, or people-carrier. Made by Ford for Nissan, Quest was designed in
Nissan's California studios. Between them, Altima and Quest helped Nissan to
a half-year sales increase of nearly one fifth, to just over 330,000.
Given the general malaise among Japanese producers, that is impressive, but
it only moves Nissan back towards the position it enjoyed during the
mid-1980s. Nissan, together with its upmarket Infiniti marque, remains well
behind Toyota and Lexus, which ended the first six months on 509,000 sales
and a slightly reduced market share.
Nissan was on fairly level pegging with Honda and Acura, whose 328,000 sales
were achieved in the absence of any offerings in the increasingly important
market segments for minivans, pick-ups and off-roaders. Technically, such
vehicles are trucks, although they are usually used like passenger cars.
They now account for three out of every five vehicle sales in the US.
The trend continued this year. While traditional passenger car sales eased
up 2.4 per cent, truck demand soared up 17.4 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (15): A greater mood of
optimism - North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICA'S Big Three vehicle manufacturers - Ford, General Motors and
Chrysler - which have spent a decade losing market share in their own
country to nimbler Japanese rivals, are at last hitting back hard and
winning market share gains.
The revival of Detroit still has a long way to go, and special factors may
be making the Japanese atypically weak at present, yet there is a greater
mood of optimism in the US motor industry now that at any time since the
early 1980s.
That was when the Japanese began not only importing vehicles to the US but
also manufacturing in America, setting up so-called 'transplant' assembly
plants, for the most part making cars rather than trucks. This helped boost
their share of the US car market to more than 30 per cent by the early
1990s.
The improved mood in Detroit stems partly from the fact that the US vehicle
market generally is recovering from the deep recession of 1991-2, and sales
growth is running somewhat ahead of the overall economic recovery.
This may be due partly to the high average age of the fleet presently on US
roads, and partly to low interest rates, which makes borrowing for a new car
less painful.
Whatever the reason, US vehicle sales could total about 14m units in 1993,
up from roughly 13m last year - and Detroit is winning a bigger share of
this larger pie.
In the first six months of this year the Big Three accounted for 75 per cent
of car and light truck sales, up from 72.5 per cent in the same period of
last year. Asian companies saw their share drop to 22.8 per cent from 24.7
per cent.
In the car market alone, Detroit boosted its share from 65.1 per cent to
67.7 per cent, while the Asians dipped from 30.7 per cent to 28.9 per cent.
Why the change? First, the Americans are seeing the fruits of the painful
lessons they learnt from the Japanese in the 1980s. Detroit is developing
vehicles more quickly, and bringing its suppliers into the design process;
it has introduced Japanese style 'lean' manufacturing techniques in many
plants. And it has realised the importance of building the highest quality
into its products.
Chrysler, for example, the smallest of the Big Three, totally changed the
way it operated after studying Honda, the first Japanese company to set up
'transplant' operations in the US.
Japanese vehicles still tend to have a higher reputation for quality than US
ones among American customer surveys, but the gap has narrowed to the point
where consumers are prepared to pay greater attention to other issues, such
as a vehicle's styling, price and dealer service.
The Americans are doing much better in the style stakes. Chrysler has a big
hit on its hands with its very different-looking LH series of mid-sized
vehicles, the Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepid.
General Motors still has to revamp much of its model range, but its Saturn
small car is one of the country's hottest selling vehicles. Saturn, a
stand-alone project begun in the early 1980s to show that America could
compete with Japan when starting from scratch, has just moved into profit
after three years of production.
Detroit has also been much more effective than the Japanese in taking
advantage of a trend by consumers to buy pick-up trucks, mini-vans or
four-wheel-drive Jeep-style vehicles rather than cars. This segment of the
market is likely to account for about 40 per cent of total US sales this
year, up from about 36 per cent in 1992.
Many of these vehicles have substantially higher profit margins than cars.
Ford's four-wheel-drive Explorer and Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee have
been especially successful.
Japan's share of the light truck market has dropped from a peak of 20.4 per
cent in 1986 to 13.5 per cent in 1992. Factors behind this drop include the
sheer strength of the US competition; the fact that imported trucks have
long faced a 25 per cent tariff; and dumping allegations by the Big Three,
which have held back Japanese mini-van sales.
In both the car and truck markets, Japan's competitive position has been
hurt by the rise in the value of the yen relative to the dollar since the
start of this year.
This has forced the Japanese manufacturers to push up prices in the US much
more aggressively than their Detroit rivals.
This trend shows no sign of changing in the near term. General Motors, for
example, recently announced that it would seek to raise its market share
during the 1994 model year by increasing its overall vehicle prices by an
average of only 1.8 per cent - well below the expected rate of inflation.
Still, Detroit can hardly afford any complacency. For one thing, exchange
rates are unpredictable and the dollar could strengthen against the yen. And
some observers suspect that the Japanese manufacturers may, to some degree,
be deliberately soft-pedalling in the US market so as to stave off tougher
trade sanctions by the Clinton administration.
Whatever the case, the Japanese remain formidable competitors and the Big
Three still have some way to go to match their manufacturing efficiency and
reputation for quality.
None has further to travel than General Motors which is still losing money
in North America and remains extremely inefficient compared to the rest of
the industry. However, the plan it put in place last year to return North
America to profit is starting to bear fruit.
GM says it is on target to break even - on an earnings before interest and
tax basis - in North America this year, compared to its loss of Dollars
4.5bn in 1992. Factors include plant closures, which are bringing its
manufacturing capacity more in line with demand, job cuts and a drive to
reduce its biggest single cost item, raw materials.
But restoring its North American operations to healthy profits is likely to
take several years, and will depend in no small measure on it producing an
attractive range of new vehicles which consumers are keen to buy.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (11): Domestic registrations
take a fall - Peugeot-Citroen and Renault have been struggling to respond to
the downturn / France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<TEXT>
FRENCH car manufacturers cannot remember when times were so hard.
Recession at home, falling demand in most of their principal European
markets and the increased price competitiveness of many of their
international rivals have left Peugeot-Citroen and Renault struggling to
respond to the downturn.
The domestic market, burdened by a sluggish economy and depressed consumer
confidence, contracted by 17 per cent in the first seven months of the year,
compared to the same period in 1992. Motor industry analysts see little hope
for rapid improvement.
'There isn't any sign of an upturn for the rest of the year,' says Mr Bob
Barber at James Capel, who forecasts a full year decline in the French car
market of about 15 per cent.
The downturn has taken its toll on the two principal carmakers, particularly
in their home market. Registrations of Peugeot-Citroen cars in France fell
by almost 19 per cent - to 300,500 vehicles - in the first seven months of
1993. Renault did better, but still suffered a fall of 12.7 per cent - to
314,000 vehicles, according to figures from the Committee of French
Automobile Constructors.
Profits will naturally be affected. Renault, the world's most profitable car
manufacturer in 1992 (in terms of the ratio of net profits to sales), saw
pre-tax profits plunge by by almost 90 per cent - from FFr5.44bn TO FFr730m
in the first half of the year. Peugeot-Citroen, which saw profits fall from
FFr5.53bn to FFr3.37bn in 1992, is expected by most car industry analysts to
fall into loss this year.
Amid the gloom, however, there are some signs of encouragement.
Improved sales in the UK and increased market share in Germany allowed
Peugeot-Citroen to report first half sales of FFr73.05bn, a fall of 11.4 per
cent over the first half of 1992.
This decline masked a relatively strong second quarter, in which sales fell
by 6.8 per cent.
'The results were better than expected,' says one French car industry
analyst, adding that the introduction of new models such as the Citroen
Xantia and the Peugeot 306 would help sales, particularly with the
introduction - in June - of diesel models.
For Renault, there is consolation in the fact that the company is winning
market share from its domestic rival and from international manufacturers.
'Renault has continued to strengthen its image at the expense of Peugeot,'
says one car industry executive in Paris, citing the Safrane, the high-end
model which has enjoyed a successful introduction.
For both car manufacturers there is also the potential benefit of a weaker
franc.
Peugeot-Citroen and Renault have both lost competitiveness compared with
manufacturers in Spain, the UK and Italy, which have all seen their
currencies depreciate significantly over the past nine months.
The weakening of the European exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of
last month, however, has brought a depreciation of the franc of about 3 per
cent. It has also raised the prospect of reduced financial costs through
lower interest rates.
But the prospect of continued depressed demand raises a series of difficult
decisions for the French carmakers. In particular they are faced with the
need to reduce production to adapt to the adverse conditions.
Peugeot-Citroen has already announced reduced working days at its factories
in Mulhouse and Sochaux in eastern France and is reducing its workforce by
almost 3,000 this year. It has also announced that it is stopping production
of its 405 model in its UK factory.
Car industry analysts in Paris say that, for Renault, the downturn in the
market increases pressure to finalise its merger with Volvo, the Swedish car
manufacturer, so as to achieve production economies.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, is pressing Renault to
complete the alliance with Volvo to prepare the French carmaker for
privatisation.
A final deal, which is thought to be imminent, will give the merged company
12 per cent of the European car market and more than 20 per cent of the
European truck market.
It will allow the merged company to achieve economies of scale and reduced
production costs and enable joint marketing and research operations.
If the French government has sought to galvanise the two companies into a
speedier marriage, it has also sought to protect the French car market from
what it regards as unwelcome suitors.
Both Mr Longuet and Mr Alain Lamassoure, the minister for European affairs,
have appealed to the European Commission to re-open negotiations with
Japanese car manufacturers concerning the level of their exports to the
European market.
The French government argues that the worse than expected decline in the
European market requires a further cut in Japanese exports. The Japanese
Ministry of Trade and Industry had previously agreed to a reduction of about
9.4 per cent in exports to the EC, based on a fall in European car sales of
6.5 per cent.
The two sides are expected to meet again in September to discuss the issue.
But the mood of the French car makers is unlikely to have been improved by
then.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Main players happy -
Fiat, Volkswagen-Audi and GM are the main contenders / Central and Eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL foreign investment in new or modernised car plants is becoming a
powerful stimulus to economic growth in central and eastern Europe. It is
helping economies adapt to meet the real needs of consumers rather than the
priorities of planners.
The build-up in production volumes from Fiat in Poland,
Volkswagen-controlled Skoda Automobilova in the Czech republic and, on a
lesser scale, General Motors and Suzuki in Hungary is helping to compensate
for the decline in output from the steel, heavy engineering and arms
industries which were the mainstays of the old economies.
As in the UK, where heavy inward investment by the big Japanese car
companies is helping to reverse decades of industrial decline, central
Europe is gaining export-orientated plants whose demand for components has
spawned rapid collateral growth in components manufacture.
Central Europe is becoming both a significant player in the European car
industry per se and a fast-growing source of car components as western
components makers follow the leading car producers with low-cost,
locally-produced components and trim.
In some cases, companies such as Ford, which have decided against building
assembly plants in the region, have opted instead to lower the overall cost
of assembling vehicles in their existing west European plants by sourcing
components in this low cost region. Ford, for example, is sourcing many of
its electrical components from a new Dollars 100m plant south of Budapest.
The rising production of components is steadily improving the local content
ratio of the Fiat Cinquecento, Skoda Favorit and other models coming off the
assembly lines - and so maximising the advantage of low wage rates and high
skill levels.
Over time, rapid economic growth will erode the wage-cost advantage which is
currently the main attraction for the European and US multinationals. But
higher incomes will raise purchasing power and unleash the potential of what
is still a largely untapped market of 65m people in central Europe alone.
Significantly, Poland, with 39m people, has become the first of the
post-communist states to recover from the steep initial restructuring
recession. One of the forces behind recovery was a 32 per cent rise in car
output last year as production of the new Cinquecento, mainly for export to
Italy and other EC markets, soared from 5,500 in 1991 to 82,400.
This year, Cinquecento output is building up towards the 240,000 capacity
planned for mid-decade, while a new Fiat family car will roll off the
production lines within the next two or three years. Limited assembly of the
the GM Astra model at the Warsaw FSO plant will further boost output.
A 29 per cent rise in output from Skoda Automobilova over the first quarter
of 1993 reflects a similar pattern in the Czech republic which is also
poised to resume overall economic growth in the second half of this year.
Skoda Automobilova plans to double output to about 440,000 vehicles as
Volkswagen seeks to repeat its success in revamping Seat in Spain and create
a new generation of low-cost but well-engineered cars from its Czech plants.
In Hungary, output is also building up from the Magyar Suzuki plant at
Esztergom, built on a former Soviet military base close to the Austrian
border. But the first investment by Japanese industry in the region faces
big problems.
The recession and fierce competition in EC markets together with a
stronger-than-expected Hungarian forint, cultural problems with a local
labour force reluctant to adapt to a Japanese-style work regime, and the
impact of a strong yen on its imported components have all conspired to make
life difficult for the company.
General Motors has also found that the unexpectedly rapid liberalisation of
Hungary's foreign trade regime changed the assumptions upon which it based
its original DM400m decision to build both a small Astra assembly plant and
an engine factory at Szentgottard in western Hungary. The original plan was
to earn hard currency from engine exports to other GM plants, to pay for the
foreign exchange costs of the imported kits for Astra assembly in Hungary
for the domestic market.
Intense competition in the still depressed Hungarian domestic market means
that General Motors is now having to export Astras from its Hungarian plant
which contain expensive imported components and are built in uneconomically
low volumes.
Despite the problems faced by earlier entrants, however, Hungary remains
popular among foreign investors.
Fiat and Volkswagen-Audi have emerged as the main European players in
central Europe, with the French industry reduced to small kit assembly
operations in Poland and the traditional close links with the Romanian
industry.
General Motors leads the American pack, seeing its scaled-down Astra
assembly operation in Poland as a toe-hold in what is expected to be the
fastest growing market in the region.
The main players seem happy with their strategic moves into central Europe
and are cautiously reviewing prospects further east where the future of
economic reform remains clouded by political factors and the enduring power
of the old communist nomenklatura in the big state-owned plants.
Significantly, however, car production has held up surprisingly well in the
former Soviet states.
Last year, while industrial output generally fell by more than 18 per cent
in Russia, car production fell by only 6.6 per cent, according to a study by
Planecon Europe and DRI-McGraw-Hill.
Exports also performed well, even though the various Lada models now coming
off the production lines for export have to compete head-on for hard
currency sales both in the west and in the former Comecon states.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Tough battle for recovery
 -Volvo and Saab depend on the alliances they have forged / Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO judge by the dismal performance recently of Volvo and Saab, Sweden is not
a good place to make cars.
Operating losses in Volvo's car division piled up to SKr4.45bn in the years
1990, 1991 and 1992. In the same period, overall losses at Saab totalled
SKr8.18bn. Both companies have continued in the red in 1993, suffering heavy
declines in the numbers of vehicles sold in the first half of the year.
This has taken place against a background of a catastrophic decline in their
home market. New car sales in Sweden, in the grip of a fierce recession for
the past three years, have plummeted from a peak of 340,000 in 1988 to an
expected figure this year of less than 120,000.
The survival of these two potent symbols of Swedish manufacturing and
engineering prowess has come to depend on the alliances they have forged
with foreign volume car producers - with France's Renault, in the case of
Volvo, and with America's General Motors, which is a 50 per cent co-owner of
Saab along with Sweden's Saab-Scania group.
Already, both companies have undergone profound and expensive restructuring
which has cost the jobs of thousands of their Swedish workers. Now, with new
models launched, Volvo and Saab are fighting to prove that Swedish carmakers
can have a profitable future - albeit under the wing of foreign partners.
With the bulk of cars produced by both companies sold overseas, the collapse
of the Swedish market is not as damaging as it might seem at first sight.
But it makes the task of recovery even harder, particularly given the
double-digit decline in car sales in Europe this year.
The strategy common to both the Renault-Volvo and the GM-Saab links is that
both the Swedish companies will continue to produce cars that retain a clear
Volvo and Saab identity. Their individual look - the body styling - and
their Swedish qualities of safety, performance and 'greenness' will be
carefully preserved. Meanwhile, under the skin, there will be the maximum
use of common components, design and production systems, to cut costs.
However, the evolution of the two alliances has been very different. In the
case of Saab, the smaller of the two rivals, GM bought in in 1989, took over
management control and has since pumped in SKr4bn in new capital, matched by
a similar amount from Saab-Scania, which is fully owned by Sweden's powerful
Wallenberg family.
Saab now operates as an arm of GM, producing its premium 900 and 9000 models
to compete principally with BMW, Audi and Mercedes in a market segment GM
and its European operation Opel otherwise do not directly contest.
For Volvo, the link with Renault has been more complex. It began in
September 1990 with an exchange of minority stakes at a time when Volvo had
been waxing strong and Renault's finances were weak. Since then, however,
this position has reversed to the point that Volvo is set to be the junior
partner when the link matures into a full merger, as is anticipated shortly.
Volvo shareholders have expressed some confusion over what Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the chairman and long-time chief of Volvo, intends the future
shape of the company should be. This confusion has been compounded by the
deal Mr Gyllenhammar struck with the Swedish government earlier this year
over Procordia, the drugs and food group jointly controlled by Volvo and the
state.
Under the accord, Volvo will take over the food businesses of Procordia and
retain up to a 35 per cent stake in the spun-off pharmaceuticals unit.
Many Swedish investors have questioned why a car, truck and marine engine
manufacturer should want to diversify in this way.
The resolution of what had been a year-long wrangle with the government over
Procordia cleared the way for further deepening of the Renault-Volvo
relationship.
Already, Renault and Volvo have gone a long way towards integrating their
car production. They make some 20 per cent of their annual purchases jointly
to cut supply costs and say this could rise to 80 per cent. Renault supplies
engines and gearboxes for the smaller Volvo 400 series made in the
Netherlands. It will supply diesel engines for both companies, while Volvo's
latest petrol engine will go into some Renault models.
In June, they set up a joint department to plan new car production and they
plan a common platform for their next generation of executive models.
Both Volvo and Saab, in league with their foreign partners, have done much
to improve their competitive position. They have been helped considerably by
the strong devaluation late last year of the Swedish krona. But in a falling
market, with heavy overcapacity in world car making, they still face a tough
battle for recovery.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): New mood of austerity -
Everywhere, companies are putting production lines on short time / Spain

THE multinationals manufacturing cars in Spain tell a common tale of losses
and, also, of big investments geared to put their operations back into the
black.
The two themes of the tale run in parallel. The losses are as much a product
of depressed markets as of continuing capital investment programmes. The
investments firmly underline the shared belief in Spain's future as one of
Europe's leading car producing centres.
Nissan Motor Iberica, which is 66 per cent owned by the Japanese car
manufacturer, posted losses of Pta14.3bn last year. Profits at Ford fell by
47.8 per cent to Pta10.7bn and Seat, Volkswagen's 100 per cent-owned Spanish
subsidiary went into the red for the first time in four years, registering
1992 losses of Pta12.7bn.
By the first quarter of this year, Nissan was preparing the markets for even
greater losses. At the end of March the Spanish company's losses topped
Pta11bn, against Pta1.7bn in the first three months of last year, and
Nissan, the parent company, announced it would would wholly subscribe an
immediate capital increase of Pta5bn, at par, for the Barcelona-based
producer .
Nissan Motor Iberica's board approved further capital increases up to a
maximum of Pta27.8bn and the parent company said it was studying a further
Pta5bn capital injection this year and an equivalent investment in 1994.
The pattern of losses plus greater investment was evident elsewhere in the
domestic car sector. Seat, which expects to post further losses this year,
has invested a total of Pta244.5bn in a new plant, also near Barcelona,
which was inaugurated last spring. The plant, possibly the last great car
production centre to be built in western Europe, is destined to manufacture
a new Ibiza model.
Ford had earlier chosen Spain as the production centre for its 'Sigma'
motors. This involves investment in the region of Pta70bn and the addition
of 800 highly qualified employees to the US company's 12,000 labour force at
its plant near Valencia. The 'Sigma' motors are based on a four-cylinder,
16-valve prototype and consist of a full range of models up to 1,400cc.
Such investments amount to a courageous long-term bet. Already at the
begining of this year domestic industry experts were forecasting a fall of
between 5 and 7 per cent for 1993 in the internal car market.
The final figures could be a lot worse than the most pessimistic estimates
in that initial forecast. Recession continues to make big inroads on the
Spanish economy and the government is now saying that that 1993 GDP will
show a negative growth of 0.5 per cent. Independent economists say the GDP
is likely to closer to minus 1 per cent.
The Spain-based manufacturers are even more concerned about the economic
stagnation elsewhere in Europe. This is because Europe is the domestic
industry's main client and has in the past absorbed as much as 70 per cent
the sector's output. To a degree, the falling demand in Europe will be
compensated by the shrinking value of the peseta which has depreciated by
more than 20 per cent ion the past 12 months against most leading
currencies.
The investments however, in the main, date back to the buoyant late 1980s
period and it would prove even more costly to stop them short at this stage.
Just as Seat has its hopes fixed on the models that will roll out of its new
plant early next year and as Ford linked up a good measure of its future in
Spain to the 'Sigma' motor, so Nissan Motor Iberica has set great store by
the launch this year of a four-wheel vehicle called Terrena II and of a
people carrier vehicle named Serena.
Both the Japanese subsidiary's products are aimed at fast-growing niche
markets and the Terrena II will have the added boost of a joint marketing
effort that will involve Ford's pan-European distribution networks.
Car manufacturers in Spain, as elsewhere, are nevertheless taking no
chances. Across the board, the companies are placing production lines on
short time to cut down on stocks, reducing their labour force and
negotiating hard to force unions to moderate wage increases.
Indicative of the new mood of austerity was Seat's decision this year to
freeze executive salaries until further notice.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (10): European slump applies
the brakes - Western Europe's car market fell by nearly 18 per cent / UK
Motor Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The steepest continental European car market slump in recent memory has at
last begun to apply the brakes to a resurgent UK motor industry.
After hovering at an unchanged 13.5m units in 1992, western Europe's car
market fell by nearly 18 per cent in the first seven months of this year.
The UK market, which went into recession much earlier, has gone against the
Euro-trend: up by 9.1 per cent in the same period. But even with most
forecasters expecting sales to grow this year to between 1.75m and 1.8m -
from 1992's 1.59m - it is too small to sustain output from some UK car
plants in the face of such a sharp drop in demand on the Continent.
In gross output terms, statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers
(SMMT) and Central Statistical Office continued to paint a buoyant picture
of expansion during the first half of this year. They showed car production
up by 8.19 per cent, to 742,991, over the period, compared with the 686,747
during the same period last year.
But in July, for the first time in many months, the figures showed a fall in
total output: by 2.42 per cent, to 115,648. Most tellingly, production for
export was down 16 per cent - the first significant drop of the year.
Commenting on the figures, Mr Roger King, SMMT public affairs director, says
that 'overall production levels are clearly at risk in the face of shrinking
exports.'
Even so, production would have to slump by nearly one third in the remaining
months of this year if the 1992 total of 1,291,880 were not to be exceeded.
Most analysts still expect a final outturn approaching 1.4m - which would be
the highest since 1975 and a far cry from the 880,000 produced in 1982, in
the depths of the previous recession.
Nevertheless, production at the traditional UK 'big four', Rover, Ford,
Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot, is now contracting - in some cases sharply.
Growth this year is entirely the result of the start of UK production by
Toyota and Honda, together with an expansion into two-model production by
Nissan's plant at Sunderland.
The most recent statistics for manufacturers' production, covering the first
five months of this year, show that Nissan's output of Primeras and the
small Micra was up 43 per cent to 115,244, compared with a year ago.
Toyota produced 9,727 Carina E saloons and hatchbacks after starting
production at Burnaston, in Derbyshire, at the turn of the year. Honda,
which started production at its Swindon plant at about the same time,
produced 10,886 of its Accord model in the same period.
That contrasts with a 3 per cent production drop at Rover, 5.2 per cent at
Vauxhall, 12.3 per cent at Ford and a production drop of nearly 16 per cent
at Peugeot Talbot.
By July, the actual cutbacks were starting. Most significantly, Peugeot
decided to end its UK production of the 405 family saloon, its market
mainstay. Having become a two-model plant only last January - when the new
306 hatchback entered production - Ryton is now building only the 306.
Output has been reduced to 1,600 cars a week from 1,900 and 300 jobs are
being cut.
Vauxhall has begun to cut shifts both at its Astra plant at Ellesmere Port
and at Luton, where it produces the Cavalier/Opel Vectra. Ford has taken
similar action at Halewood.
Despite its own output also falling back slightly, Rover Group was
continuing to maintain in early August that it had no plans for cutbacks at
either its Longbridge plant near Birmingham or the Cowley facilities near
Oxford, where it has recently invested Pounds 200m on modernisation.
On the contrary: Rover, which is now the only European manufacturer to be
increasing both volume sales and market share in Europe, maintains that it
is exploring ways of increasing output of its Metro and Mini small cars at
Longbridge. In the first seven months of this year its total sales in
Europe, including the UK, rose by 10.5 per cent to 191,000 and its market
share from 2 per cent to 2.7 per cent. That output has not matched the
increase reflects mainly the British Aerospace subsidiary's 'lean
distribution' efforts - to cut stocks in the supply line between factories
and dealers' showrooms.
Although Nissan has changed the balance of its production, reducing the
Primera output and increasing the Micra's, it says the downturn in
continental Europe should not stop it reaching its target output, from
Sunderland, of 270,000 cars this year. Similarly, Toyota and Honda maintain
that they are on course to achieve their respective output targets of 36,000
and 32,000 for this year.
Toyota, however, is already speeding up its previously declared, longer-term
production targets.
It intends to produce 100,000 cars next year - a year ahead of the original
schedule - on the way to to 200,000-a-year production in the late 1990s.
DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group, regards this as conservative. It
predicts that by 1998 Japanese 'transplant' production in the UK will have
reached 800,000 units a year, and that well before then Toyota will have
added the smaller Corolla to Carina E production at Burnaston.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, Toyota's president, has already indicated that Toyota is
'considering' a second model for the plant.
DRI projects that, overall, UK car output will reach a record 2.1m by 1998
and that the UK motor industry will once again be recording a substantial
balance of trade surplus after recording deficits of as much as Pounds 6bn
in some recent years.
Competition within the UK market, however, is expected to remain intense and
keep profit margins under pressure.
The long-sustained market leadership by Ford of Britain, which made a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m last year, is being challenged as never before
by General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary. Vauxhall actually beat Ford in the
UK sales charts for the first time in July, although total sales in the
month are very small and regarded as unrepresentative because they precede
the August sales 'bulge' caused by the introduction of the new registration
plate prefix.
Rover, buoyed up by the new 600 saloon range and its surging Range Rover,
Discovery and Land Rover output, is also reversing its long trend of market
share decline.
In the first seven months of this year it accounted for 13.7 per cent of UK
new car sales, up from 12.9 per cent in the year-ago period and fewer than
four percentage points behind Vauxhall's 17.3.
Ford, which once regularly commanded 30 per cent of all new UK car sales,
now has a share of only around 22 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (7): Carmakers focus on labour
cuts - If the future seems black, the present looks even blacker / Germany

THE rejuvenation of the German motor industry is under way with a vengeance
 -especially at Volkswagen. The company recently concluded a deal with its
workers' councils under which employees will be able to retire at 55.
For the five years until they become eligible for a normal pension,
Volkswagen workers will be paid 90 per cent of their net salary: a third
from the company and the rest from state employment budgets.
While this milestone agreement demonstrates the vigour with which VW is
cutting its labour force in its fight to return to profit, it also shows how
difficult it has become to cut the fat. Reduction of the retirement age is a
costly attempt to avoid the unthinkable: forced redundancies. Common enough
in the UK and the US, they are almost unknown in Germany's 'social economy'.
Almost 100,000 jobs have disappeared from the German vahicle industry in the
past two years. Furthermore, according to Mr Achim Diekmann, director of the
VDA industry association, another 100,000 must go by the middle of 1995. In
the meantime, overall costs must be reduced by 20 to 30 per cent, he says.
If the future seems black, the present looks even blacker. The industry
association is now counting on German car production tumbling from 4.86m
last year to about 4m in 1993 - a drop of 18 per cent compared with
springtime forecasts, considered grim at the time, of 10 per cent.
The French and Italian markets have failed to produce expected sales growth
because of recession and revaluation of the D-Mark. Some German makers have
increased list prices to compensate but, according to analysts, risk losing
market share. Volkswagen, for example, has raised Italian prices by about 11
per cent. In Germany, too, the drop in new car registrations is markedly
worse, so far, than the expected 20 per cent decline for 1993 - and now the
VDA is worried that next January's 16-pfennig increase in the cost of
petrol, coming at a time when disposable incomes are shrinking in real
terms, will prolong the domestic downturn.
On top of all this, the industry is concerned about the damage to German
brands' export potential which could be caused by Volkswagen's bitter set-to
with Adam Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary.
But the extraordinary story of VW's seduction of GM's Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, the renowned 'cost-killer,' and the clouds of allegations
which followed him from Detroit to Wolfsburg, have tended to obscure the
deep-seated restructuring going on throughout the German car industry before
Lopez arrived and unleashed his procurement 'warriors' on parts suppliers.
Almost two years ago the industry at large turned its attention to what is
seen as its greatest problem: cost. Whatever quality, image and engineering
advantages German cars may possess, their sales prospects are hobbled by
their being 20 per cent too expensive.
According to the VDA, labour costs per vehicle produced in France, almost
the same as in Germany 10 years ago, are now about 30 per cent less than
levels across the border. The German labour force was the first, obvious
target for the knife, but as VW's early-retirement programme illustrates,
there are limits if confrontation with the workforce is to be avoided.
But the search for economies has spread far beyond car manufacturing plants.
Germany's estimated 3,000 components companies are now in the front line,
confronted by demands for instant price cuts, new contracts and threats if
they do not comply.
Much has been made of VW's blunt demands for 30 per cent price cuts. Two
companies have already claimed that they have been driven out of business by
its tactics. The survivors complain they have already paid their dues for
the restructuring of the industry, and cite independent research by Deutsche
Bank analysts which shows that between 1985 and 1992 components prices
increased by only about 5 per cent, while retail prices of cars rose more
than a quarter.
But however justified their appeals may be, they are caught in a deadly
squeeze. As Mr Lopez discovered at Opel - part of a multinational group with
wide international contacts - there are plenty of French, Italian, British
and other suppliers willing to step into any breach left by German
manufacturers which fail to meet his demands. Former communist-bloc
countries increasingly offer even cheaper sources for some parts.
This has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. According to industry estimates, the
foreign content of an average German car is already 30 per cent, compared
with 25 per cent last year. Mercedes, for example, which traditionally buys
about 90 per cent of its components from German companies, is seeking to
reduce the proportion to about 75 per cent.
According to VW's new management, the German motor industry is fighting for
its life. No-one wins such a struggle without pain and sacrifice.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (8): Task has been getting
tougher by the day - Profits have fallen, but one famous name is managing
remarkably well / BMW'S New Strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernd Pischetsrieder, an earnest, mild-mannered engineer who joined BMW's
production planning operations straight from university 20 years ago, knew
he had a tough act to follow when he was appointed this year - at the age of
45 - to succeed Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim as BMW's management board chairman.
Since May, when he first got his feet under the desk which Mr von Kunheim
had occupied for 23 years, the task has been getting tougher almost by the
day. Europe's car markets continue to weaken and the deteriorating
competitiveness of Germany as a manufacturing base has become ever more
cruelly exposed.
Given the onset of recession in most of its important world markets since
the start of the 1990s, BMW has, in fact, done remarkably well. Last year it
built a record 598,000 cars - some 8 per cent more than the previous year
and, for the first time, more than its rival, Mercedes-Benz. The value of
sales rose by nearly 5 per cent to DM31.2bn. But operating profits fell by
more than 15 per cent, to DM1.48bn. And for the first time since the
mid-1980s, net profit was lower, by about 7 per cent at DM726m.
And this year, with demand problems compounded by the D-mark still riding
high on the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut interest rates, the profits
situation has deteriorated sharply. Net profit for the first half fell by
more than one-third to DM421m. Analysts expect full-year profits of about
DM500m.
Mr Pischetsrieder has also warned that there is no prospect of production
matching 1992's levels. Car output in the first half was down 10 per cent at
275,000 - although this was still a much better performance than the German
motor industry overall, which cut output by one quarter.
Some markets, notably North America and the UK, are on the upswing, helping
to counter the continental European sales slide. BMW should also benefit
substantially when its new plant at Spartenburg, in South Carolina, starts
production in 1995; it is expected to be able to build cars 40 per cent more
cheaply than in Germany. The plant will add 70,000 cars a year to BMW's
existing 560,000 cars a year capacity in Germany. The car will be an
entirely new model, thought to be a sports car, for sale throughout the
world.
And an agreement just signed, under which 3-Series and 5-Series cars will be
assembled in Vietnam, will also add to the - relatively minor - revenue
stream from existing similar operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and
Latin America.
But in the meantime, cost-cutting and greater commonality of components,
backed up by the introduction of an array of new models to broaden BMW's
available market, are now at the top of the agenda in terms of reversing the
fall in profits.
More jobs than the 3,500 already lost this year are likely to go as part of
the process.
With the greater diversity of models, Mr Pischetsrieder intends BMW to
secure a step increase in its world market share from the current level of
about 1.7 per cent. He indicates that the diversity is likely to take BMW
into market sectors not associated with the company since the 1960s.
The motor show now starting in Frankfurt is not expected to provide an
immediate launch pad. More engine variants and extra models in the 3 and 5
series ranges are more in prospect. The company needs them, for it is about
to start facing much stiffer competition from its arch-rival Mercedes' 190
replacement, now being launched. According to Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes'
chairman, some 150,000 of the new model will be made this year, rising to
about 200,000 in 1994 and 250,000 in 1995.
But more radical things are on the way from BMW.
It does not exactly intend to return to producing the three-wheeled 'bubble
cars' which were a familiar sight on Europe's roads 30 years ago. But like
Mercedes' recently-unveiled concept 'city' car, the Vision A 93, BMW's
similar Z13 urban runabout points the way to a possible whole new market
sector for BMW in the mid-to-late 1990s.
On the cost-cutting, Mr Pischetsrieder says he believes there is much
greater scope for closer co-operation between European vehicle makers as
well as the components industry to achieve savings. For example, he points
out that it is self-defeating for individual manufacturers separately to
develop complex and expensive systems to perform essentially the same task,
using anti-lock braking systems developed by Alfred Teves, Robert Bosch and
Mercedes as an illustration.
Mercedes appears to agree. Already the two companies have started their
first tentative collaboration on components. 'It would be ill-advised to
continue to try to make everything ourselves,' Mr Werner says.
Such a development marks a milestone in the history of both companies, each
of which has remained among the most determinedly independent and vertically
integrated of all the world's car companies.
It is a measure of the severe pressures under which they, and the entire
German motor industry, now find themselves. The pressures can only increase
further - not go away.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (9): Why Fiat needs a winner -
The Punto must match its highly successful predecessor if the Turin group is
to recover the leading position from which it has slipped / Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH austerity is becoming the watchword with Italians, they are
unlikely to begrudge Fiat a PR splash in launching the Punto this month. A
measured dose of ostentation and drum-beating will not be held amiss for a
new car that is considered fundamental for Fiat's fortunes.
The Turin carmaker has not had much success with new models since it
launched the Uno a decade ago. The Uno earned praise from journalists and
won the European Car of the Year Award in 1983. But as well as being a
journalists' favourite, it was also a commercial hit with the car-buying
public.
Indeed, it continues to draw purchasers into showrooms. The Uno's appeal is
such that it still heads Italian rankings of new car sales 10 years after
its launch. With 146,400 sold in the first half of this year, the Uno
achieved more than double the sales of its nearest rival, Ford's Fiesta.
Clearly, the evergreen Uno will be hard to follow. Yet the Punto must match
its highly successful predecessor if Fiat is to recover the leading position
from which it has slipped over the past five years. 'The launch will
represent an important milestone in the programme for the renewal of the
product range,' Fiat's directors told shareholders this summer.
Much depends on the Punto's visual impact. 'Styling is the principal factor
in car purchase in Italy,' says Mr Giuseppe Gabriele, director of the car
importers' association UNRAE. In involving stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro in the
Punto, Fiat hopes that the designer of the Uno will be on target again.
But the new factory at Melfi, near Potenza in southern Italy, where the
Punto will be produced, will also play a critical part in determining
whether the Punto will be a success or not. Quality and efficiency are the
keywords at Melfi.
Fiat says that its green-field factory is in the vanguard of car production
and will ensure manufacturing excellence and cost competitive products.
Flexibility and a just-in-time approach, achieved by the location of primary
suppliers at the same site, are features on which Fiat is basing its hopes
at Melfi.
Series production will start in January, although cars will be leaving the
assembly lines from this month. When Melfi is fully on-stream its 7,000
workers will be building 450,000 cars each year.
Melfi represents total investment of L4,700bn and is part of a major capital
expenditure programme. Fiat's capital spending in the car sector amounted to
L3,920bn last year on net revenues of L27,450bn, a sharp increase on 1991's
figure of L2,160bn on net revenues of L27,510bn. Fiat Auto also spent
another L1,330bn on research and development last year, a slight increase
over 1991.
However, this is not an easy time for financing new investment. Cash flow at
Fiat Auto fell from L1,990bn in 1991 to L1,330bn last year, and operating
income has been sliding. From a L2,360bn high in 1989, operating income
slumped to L160bn in 1991 before plummeting to a L540bn loss last year.
Figures at group level underline the strain of financing the investment
programme. From L3,310bn in 1989, Fiat Group net income dropped to L550bn
last year, and cash flow almost halved from L6,430bn to L3,630bn. Over the
four years 1989 to 1992, the group's net financial position suffered a
massive reversal, moving from a surplus of L2,120bn at year-end 1989 to a
deficit of L3,850bn at the end of last year.
Hopes of improvement this year are slender. Industry specialists wonder
about the impact on the accounts of summer sales campaigns, aimed at
reducing stocks before the Punto's launch. But the costs of special offers,
discounts and other encouragements to move stocks are less significant than
market conditions.
Fiat is launching its new model at an inauspicious moment. Car sales in
Italy in the first half of the year slumped by 22.5 per cent against the
same period last year. Mr Gabriele expects that new car sales will be
between 15 and 18 per cent lower than last year, suggesting a total of
between 1,950,000 and 2,010,000.
Others are less sanguine. Mr Salvatore Pistola, managing director of Rover
Italia, believes that 1,870,000 new cars will have been sold when the year
closes. Mr Massimo Berni, head of General Motors Italia, says: 'There are no
prospects for improvement in the short term, and the trend suggests a figure
of 1,800,000.'
Mr Pistola and Mr Berni both think that there might be a small increase to
1,900,000 next year. If the more pessimistic experts are correct, Fiat and
the importers may have to wait until 1996 before the 2m threshold is again
crossed.
Economic, political and fiscal factors underlie the sharp drop in the
market. The depressed economic climate is one of the reasons why Italians
are deferring car purchases. 'There is no shortage of liquidity, but people
are not spending because they are worried about their jobs,' says Mr
Gabriele, adding that political uncertainty also acts as a brake on big
spending decisions by families.
Additional taxes and increased health charges have also induced caution in
family spending this year. 'The government's continual search for extra tax
revenues is causing diffidence and a reluctance to take extra commitments or
spend savings when these might be needed to meet surprise tax bills,' says
Mr Gabriele. The company car is not a significant part of the new car market
in Italy, sales depending predominantly on how families manage their
budgets.
However, Fiat is not only launching the Punto into a sickly economy, it is
also having to fight aggressive competition from importers. Over the past
five years, foreign makes have steadily eroded Fiat's share of the Italian
market. In 1988, the Turin group sold 1.35m cars for a market share of 59.9
per cent. Sales last year were 1.05m, cutting Fiat's domestic market share
to 44.3 per cent.
Fiat has paid the price of failure to renew its range with attractive models
to compete with imports in terms of style, technology and cost. Indeed, even
in the particularly difficult conditions of the first half of this year,
during which Fiat was able to regain a little market share to 44.6 per cent
 -albeit on a 22.1 per cent volume drop - some importers have been able to
buck the trend.
The most prominent is Nissan, which is enjoying booming sales of its
Sunderland-built Micras and Primeras. In the first six months, Nissan sold
24,500 cars - an increase of 78.4 per cent on the same period last year - to
take a market share of 2.3 per cent.
Rover and General Motors are also both performing well, Rover suffering a
volume decline of only 2.4 per cent and GM 4.1 per cent between January and
June.
Mr Pistola says that 'Roverisation' has been successful, with the Rover
badge enjoying a good image for styling, quality and technology. 'We are
competitive on price,' says Rover's managing director. The company is doing
well in certain niches, and with its 800 series top-of-the-range saloons and
coupes.
'November's launching of the 600 series, which has a distinctive styling
edge, should help us increase market share. The 400 series station wagon
being launched next year will also provide a boost,' says Mr Pistola. And he
believes that Rover will double its market share when it launches its new
small car in two or three years.
'Value for money is General Motor's formula,' says Mr Berni. Last year,
Opel's sales rose by 33.7 per cent to 134,000, and its market share
increased from 4.3 to 5.6 per cent. Although sales dipped slightly in the
first six months this year, Opel's share increased to 6.6 per cent. 'We are
a volume business, but strong in niches at the same time,' Mr Berni says,
pointing to Opel's success with the Astra estate and Calibra coupe.
Despite the German origin and D-Mark pricing of much of GM's imports, the
company has made sure to keep price lists competitive. And this is true of
other German and French carmakers. The lira devaluation is not offering
respite to Fiat in its home market. Indeed, Mr Gabriele says that there is
now a flourishing parallel export market of German and French cars due to a
30 per cent price differential.
With Italians pragmatically assessing alternatives when considering their
new cars, and no longer feeling patriotic obligations to buy Fiat, the Turin
group's models have to prove their worth in order to win sales. The Punto is
being launched into a different and much more competitive market than was
the Uno 10 years ago.
Its success is of fundamental importance to Fiat. But will it succeed?
Whether or not Fiat has a winner should be known next spring.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (6): British carmaker bucks the
trend - Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Rover Group has achieved a rare distinction this year. It is the only
sizeable car maker to have increased unit sales in continental Europe's
tumbling car markets.
Its European sales rose by 10.5 per cent to 191,000 in the first seven
months in the face of a nearly 18 per cent decline in the market overall.
Rover's market share has increased from 2 to 2.7 per cent. It has largely
succeeded in transforming its image from an essentially failed UK
state-owned leviathan to a relatively small but flexible and competent
producer of cars perceived to be a cut above their mass-market rivals.
And five years after buying it - as BL - for Pounds 150m from the
government, the parent company, British Aerospace became free to sell it on
August 12.
With production of 405,000 cars and Land Rover, Range Rover and Discovery
four-wheel-drive vehicles last year, Rover is a minor but nevertheless
important player in the European market. It remains, by a small margin, the
UK's biggest carmaker, although it takes second place to Ford as a vehicle
maker if light commercial vehicles are included.
Its chairman, Mr George Simpson, has depicted a future for Rover in which it
can be a viable, independent producer of around 500,000 vehicles a year;
earning enough not just to satisfy shareholders, but to make the daunting
ongoing investments required of any car maker to renew model ranges.
Even if, as some industry analysts such as Prof Garel Rhys of Cardiff
Business School's Motor Industry Research Centre indicate, Rover should need
higher volumes, it has the capacity to achieve them.
Rover's car plants at Longbridge near Birmingham and Cowley, Oxfordshire,
with Land Rover's Solihull facility could virtually double current
production with little investment and maximum multi-shift working.
Perhaps most important, it has had by far the longest and most intimate
relationship of any European manufacturer with the Japanese industry which
its rivals have come so much to fear.
Rover began building Honda's Ballade (under licence, as the Triumph
Acclaim), in 1980. Subsequently, through joint car development programmes
such as the Rover 800/Honda Legend executive cars; the smaller Rover
200/Honda Concerto and the just-launched Rover 600/Honda Accord, Rover has
assimilated to good effect much of the working culture, practices and
manufacturing systems which have served Japanese car makers so well in their
forays into overseas markets.
Honda, now making its own cars at Swindon, has itself benefited from Rover's
vehicle design expertise and there is a 20 per cent cross shareholding
between Rover and Honda's UK manufacturing subsidiary.
It was little wonder, then, then that Volkswagen, in its dash to become
European market leader by acquisition (SEAT and Skoda), was tipped as a
leading candidate to buy Rover when the UK government's strings attached to
BAe ownership were finally snipped - and after it became clear that Honda
itself had no ambitions to acquire control.
Other leading manufacturers such as Ford were also assumed to be potential
bidders, given what was a widespread assumption that BAe would seek an
almost immediate sale, for Pounds 450-Pounds 500m, and concentrate once more
on its core aerospace business.
The assumption appears to have been wrong. Not only is BAe showing no
immediate desire to sell; with defence and other parts off the aerospace
industry going off the boil, there are signs that Rover is itself coming to
be regarded as a core business.
Nor is the current depressed European motor industry climate, particularly
in Germany, conducive to acquisitions.
There is speculation about possible management buy-out proposals. But
whether in BAe or managers' hands, 'the best result could well be that Rover
remains the industrial equivalent of Belgium,' observes Prof Rhys.
The Rover 200/400 has already re-established Rover as a serious competitor
in the lower-medium car sector. Following a Pounds 200m investment to
transform production facilities at Cowley, the Rover 800 has become a market
leader in the UK executive car sector. The fact that the Rover 600 is
regularly matched against BMW by the motoring media provides further
evidence that Rover's 'upmarket' strategy is working.
A new entity, the Special Projects Division, has been formed to exploit
market niches offering the prospect of high margins for relatively low
investment. Cabriolet and Cooper versions of the evergreen Mini and the MG
RV8 sports car are just among the first of a rash of such products over the
next few years.
Production of Discovery and Range Rover models has been raised repeatedly
and Rover expects to quadruple sales of these vehicles, to 16,000 units
annually, in the US alone by the mid-1990s.
Meanwhile, it is indicative of the new flexibility of both production
processes and Rover's 33,000 strong work force that the Cowley plant, in
which Rover has invested more than Pounds 200m since 1990, is viably
building, in small batches away from the main production lines, the ageing
Montego and Maestro models.
Mr John Towers, Rover's managing director, makes clear that it will continue
to do so for as long as demand for even a few thousand a year persists.
Inevitably, however, Rover's early heavy dependence on Honda, its extensive
use of Honda engines and the Japanese maker's essentially leading role in
joint car development to date has led industry observers to question whether
Rover any longer has the technological as well as financial resources to
stand alone.
Mr Towers grins. Across Rover's product range, he points out, a full-line
product engineering capability can still be found. The Rover 200 coupe's
body shell is Rover's own, albeit on an essentially Honda platform. The
widely acclaimed K series engine owes nothing to Honda, and is being
developed from the current 1.1 and 1.4 litre versions into 1.6 litre and V6
units which will eventually displace Honda's engine in the 200/400 and 800
ranges.
Basically what the world has not so far seen is the resurgent Rover's full
technology capability brought together into one new model, he teases - but
the world may not have many years to wait.
While Rover remains notoriously tight-lipped about new product plans, it
plans to re-enter the sports car market with a K Series-engined MG,
code-named PR3, in 1995. This, however, is to be a joint venture with
Mayflower Corporation, the specialist UK engineering company, which is being
contracted to design, develop and supply the body shell.
A wholly Rover vehicle is much more likely to be a replacement for the
Metro, on which Rover is currently working.
A question mark remains, however, over finance. Mr Towers says Rover now is
close to its target of financial break-even at 400,000 cars a year, after
making startling productivity improvements - a claimed 18 per cent at Cowley
so far this year - and the result of stringent cost cutting.
Analysts expect Rover to achieve a trading profit, before interest, of
Pounds 30-50m this year. But with current debts of around Pounds 400m Rover
would still be making a net loss. And this year's trading profit will follow
two consecutive years of operating losses - Pounds 49m in 1992 and Pounds
52m in 1991.( There was a trading profit of Pounds 65m in 1990).
Mr Towers insists that it will take only a relatively modest upswing in
markets for the benefits of efficiency measures to show through. Analysts
tend to agree. Many expect profits, at least at the trading level, to more
than double in 1994, to Pounds 90m-Pounds 100m.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (4): Tensions with the EC are
growing - Painful negotiations are again under way between Brussels and
Tokyo over the levels of Japanese exports / The Japanese in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
THE rapid development of Japanese carmakers' production capacity in Europe
is coinciding alarmingly with a steep downturn in west European new car
sales.
Inevitably tensions are growing between the European Community and Japan, as
European carmakers face a growing burden of overcapacity and in many cases
mounting losses.
Painful negotiations are again under way between Brussels and Tokyo over
Japanese export levels, as some European carmakers seek sharp cuts in
Japanese vehicle shipments to the EC and call for restraints to be placed on
the level of Japanese production in Europe.
Under the terms of the controversial understanding reached by the European
Commission and the Japanese Government in 1991 - the so-called 'Elements of
Consensus' - there were to be 'no restrictions on Japanese investment or on
the free circulation of its products in the Community'.
At the same time, however, Tokyo undertook to avoid 'market disruption by
exports from Japan', and to monitor the level of its exports for seven years
to the end of 1999. The seven-year transitional period was to allow EC
carmakers to adjust 'towards adequate levels of international
competitiveness.'
The vaguely-worded 1991 understanding, which itself was only reached after
months of tortuous negotiations, had always threatened to be a minefield to
administer from the moment it came into force at the start of this year.
But Brussels and Tokyo could hardly have bargained with the enormity of the
problem they now face in the first year of the monitoring system: a plunge
in the west European car market steeper than that suffered in the wake of
the first oil crisis in the first half of the 1970s.
In April the two sides finally agreed on a ceiling for Japanese exports to
the EC of 1.089m vehicles - cars and light commercial vehicles up to 5
tonnes gross vehicle weight - for 1993, a reduction of 9.4 per cent from
1992. The reduction was based, however, on an assumed reduction of only 6.54
per cent in the EC market this year.
Even at the time the market forecast looked hopelessly optimistic, and in
June the Commission was again forced to seek talks with Tokyo to try to
negotiate a further reduction in Japanese exports. Another round of talks is
expected to take place this month.
In the event, new car sales in the EC have plunged by 17.8 per cent in the
first six months of this year, with no sign of any recovery in demand in the
second half.
The downturn in the west European new car market could hardly have come at a
more sensitive moment, with Japanese vehicle production in Europe starting
to growing rapidly. Nissan, whose European presence is most advanced, has
forecast a 51 per cent rise in output at its UK plant this year, to 270,000
cars from 179,000 in 1992.
During the last 12 months Toyota and Honda have started production at their
first European car plants, both located in the UK. Suzuki has started car
assembly at its more modest facility in Hungary. Honda is expected to
produce 32,000 cars this year at its Swindon plant in southern England,
while output at Toyota's plant at Burnaston, near Derby, is expected to
total 36,000 in 1993, rising to 100,000 next year.
Magyar Suzuki, which is scheduled to produce 15,000 cars this year, is
planning to raise output to 50,000 by 1995. In the UK Honda has talked
publicly about raising output to 100,000 by 1995, while Toyota has named
1997 as the target date for reaching a capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
However, vehicle industry analysts expect both plants to raise output
significantly above these levels by the end of the decade.
As output expands at these locations, Mitsubishi Motors is the next in line
to start production in Europe.
It is pushing ahead with the development of Netherlands Car (Nedcar), its
joint venture with Volvo of Sweden in which a one-third stake is also held
by the Dutch government.
Mitsubishi and Volvo are investing heavily in NedCar - it is currently
included in the Volvo 400 small family car series - for the development of a
new range of cars to be launched in 1995/96. The capacity of the plant at
Born in the Netherlands is being doubled to 200,000 a year. The output of
160-200,000 cars a year will be shared equally between Mitsubishi and Volvo.
NedCar says that about Fl 3bn is being invested in the development of the
cars and the plant, of which Fl 2.1bn will be financed by the present
shareholders and the remainder financed externally. The training of several
hundred NedCar employees at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Japan is already
beginning this autumn.
Above all, the Japanese car plants are having a big impact in the UK, where
they already account for more than a fifth of British car production.
DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts, forecast that the car output of
Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi in west Europe, will grow from 326,000
this year to 993,000 in 1998. At the same time the share of Japanese makes
of car in the west European new car market is forecast to grow from 11.9 per
cent last year to 15.5 per cent by 1998.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturing presence in west Europe also includes
several other ventures: Nissan Motor Iberica and Suzuki's Santana-Motor in
Spain; IBC Vehicles, Isuzu's joint venture with General Motors in the UK, as
well as Daihatsu's joint venture with Piaggio in Italy to produce small
microvans; and the production under licence of Toyota pick-ups by Volkswagen
in Germany. In Italy, Bertone produces a small volume of four-wheel-drive
vehicles, called the Freeclimber, based on the Daihatsu Sportrak but powered
by a BMW engine.
The production of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles has proved an
attractive niche for the Japanese carmakers in Europe, as these vehicles
become increasingly popular as substitutes for cars.
In the UK, IBC Vehicles produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, a
four-wheel-drive vehicle based on Isuzu technology. Frontera output is
forecast at 42,000-45,000 this year. In Spain, Santana-Motor produces the
small Suzuki Vitara four-wheel-drive vehicle with an output of 32,515 last
year, while also in Spain, Nissan production includes the Terrano II
leisure/utility vehicle - also sold as the Ford Maverick.
Despite this rapidly growing presence, it has not all been plain sailing for
the Japanese carmakers in Europe. In July Suzuki announced that it was being
forced to abandon its planned venture to produce a small car in
collaboration with Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of Volkswagen. The project
was well advanced, with production already set to start in 1995, scheduled
to rise to 150,000 a year.
For Mazda, several years of negotiations - including talks with Ford and
Saab - have ended in frustration; it has been unable to find a joint venture
partner in Europe. Mazda is left as the only one of the leading Japanese
carmakers with no firm strategy for European production.
Nissan, too, has run into expensive problems in Spain, where Nissan Motor
Iberica is accumulating heavy losses - they total Pta14.37bn (Dollars 116m)
in the whole of 1992, and a further Pta11.1bn (Dollars 89.7m) in the first
three months of this year alone. It has already been forced to inject
Pta5.023bn (Dollars 40.5m) in new equity capital into the company so far
this year, and expects to have to inject a further Pta10bn during the next
12 months.
At the same time, there are signs that the Japanese carmakers will very
quickly become just as vulnerable to recession in Europe as their
long-established rivals. Already, Nissan has been forced this year to cut
production in the UK of its Primera large family car, in response to falling
sales across Europe. It has also had to stop overtime work at the plant.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): EC Commission sweeps away
fog of confusion - To consumer groups' chagrin, manufacturers' commercial
polices were not criticised / Pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN July the EC Commission blew away another big patch of the fog of
confusion and suspicion which has long surrounded manufacturers' new car
pricing structures within the EC, writes John Griffiths.
It did so by requiring manufacturers to publish their first pan-European
price lists, showing what similar models cost in individual EC states.
The Commission's declared aim in causing the lists to be published - at
six-monthly intervals and with the next to be based on November 1 prices -
is to 'improve price transparency' for consumers wanting to shop around the
EC for the best bargains available.
For consumer groups which had long claimed that prices in some countries,
notably the UK, were too high, the first list - and the Commission's
comments on it - did not quite vindicate their stance.
The list showed that some big differentials do exist. However, while there
were isolated cases of variations of more than 40 per cent, most were either
within or not far outside the EC's own guidelines. These state that maximum
price differentials should not vary by more than 18 per cent in the short
term and by more than 12 per cent over a longer period.
To the consumer groups' chagrin, the Commission identified exchange rate
fluctuations as being a big factor in the divergences and refrained from
criticising manufacturers' commercial policies.
A principal contention of consumer organisations within the EC is that the
motor industry is using its restricted distribution system - employing
exclusively franchised dealers - to stifle competition. They claim that the
system keeps prices higher than they would be in the case of a retailing
'free-for-all' in which cars were available from almost any retailing outfit
wishing to sell them, as is the case with white or brown goods.
The motor trade and industry, which argues strongly that the complexity and
safety aspects of cars require a specialised sales and service system, is
allowed to operate its exclusive dealer systems under a specific block
exemption from normal Treaty of Rome competition rules.
However, its current exemption from the rules expires in June 1995 and the
Commission has indicated that, after making due allowance for exchange rate
changes, it does expect to see its guidelines more strictly observed if the
industry wants the exemption renewed.
For that reason, in many ways the second list in November will be more
important than the first list in providing the first clear-cut figures on
price differential trends.
The first list reflected prices, as of May 1, of 55 European and 17 Japanese
models. They were - and will continue to be - based on recommended retail
prices, adjusted for equipment differences and given in local currencies
both before and after tax.
Supplements for options such as air conditioning and power steering are
given, as well as the premium for right-hand-drive models for the UK market.
An index of differentials is arrived at by converting local currency prices
into European Currency Units (see chart).
Among small cars, variations of up to 24 per cent were found - in the case
of Fiat's Cincequento - between the most expensive market, France, and the
cheapest, Spain.
In the large saloon category, Ford's new Mondeo 1.6LX saloon was found to be
23.9 per cent more expensive in Germany than in Italy and Ireland, the
cheapest markets. At the executive car level, BMW's biggest variation was of
22 per cent, in the case of its 730i V8 model, in France, with the UK being
the cheapest.
Overall, the lists showed that for 92 per cent of mini cars on the list,
such as Fiat's Cinquecento, price disparities were less than 20 per cent.
The differential was less than 20 per cent for 89 per cent of medium-sized
family cars and 89 per cent of luxury cars. In all other market sectors
except 'people carriers', four-wheel-drives and sports cars (collectively
averaging 69 per cent), about four-fifths fell below the 20 per cent
differential level.
As regards consumer group claims that UK prices are particularly high
compared with leading continental European markets, the price lists showed
it to be an expensive market on some small cars, middling for many family
cars - and often the cheapest market for luxury cars.
Almost certainly, the Commission will find a further degree of convergence.
Manufacturers and importers have, for example, been pushing down retail list
prices in the UK. The fact that the lower 'official' prices of themselves
will have done virtually nothing to change actual transaction prices will
not prevent the EC 'convergence' figures looking better.
The cuts have been achieved mainly by reducing dealers' official
margins,from a typical 15-17 per cent to 10 per cent. Because it is has been
almost a matter of routine for dealers to give discounts of 10 per cent or
more, the only real effect is to reduce their scope for discounting.
In some cases, however, the downward pressure on list prices is real.
Volkswagen, for example, is determined to capture a larger share of the UK
market, having this year taken over UK distribution from Lonrho. To help do
so it has cut 11 per cent from the prices of diesel models; substantially
more than the 5 per cent reduction on its dealers' margins.
And Ford, with its traditional UK market leadership now under strong
challenge, was obliged by market pressure to cut prices of its Mondeo model
by a real 6 per cent - the dealers' margin was already only 10 per cent -
only two weeks after its launch.
Not surprisingly, the European industry has sought to make political capital
out of the Commission's acknowledgment of the big role played by currency
movements.
What has been demonstrated conclusively, according to the European
Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), is that it is unrealistic to
make meaningful price comparisons - let alone have 'harmonised' prices -
when some currencies have been so volatile. Between July last year and the
middle of May, the main EMS currencies - German, French, Belgian, Dutch and
Danish - rose 22 per cent against the lira (briefly touching 32 per cent in
April), 20 per cent against the peseta, 17 per cent against sterling and 15
per cent against the Portuguese escudo.
'Manufacturers - particularly non-local manufacturers - cannot be expected
to make instant double-digit price changes,' the ACEA contended.
The price lists themselves have a lot of inbuilt compromises. They do not
take account of the widely varying discounts available in individual
markets.
And while excluding Denmark and Greece, because local taxation - of more
than 100 per cent - is seen as excessively depressing pre-tax prices,
Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal are included even though national
taxation in each can add 50 per cent to the cost of a new car.
In these countries, too, manufacturers have a strong incentive to keep
pre-tax prices down in order for tax-inclusive prices not to be beyond the
reach of ordinary consumers.
The Commission implicitly has accepted that such tax regimes in themselves
are an undesirable obstacle to the convergence it is seeking from
manufacturers. It has indicated that it will put pressure on the governments
involved to reduce such distortions.
But if such governments are feeling such pressure, there is as yet no
visible sign.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (3): Intense international
battle looms - Falling sales and excess capacity mean that producers must
take drastic measures in the race to regain global competitiveness / Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
EUROPE has become the battleground of the world motor industry in the 1990s.
As demand for cars has nosedived across the continent, the failure of some
European carmakers to put their houses in order during the recent years of
strong sales has become glaringly apparent.
The race to regain global competitiveness is intense - the frontiers of the
European car market will be thrown fully open to Japanese import competition
by the end of the decade. Japanese carmakers are already establishing a
growing local production presence in Europe.
Large parts of the European industry have been forced into short-time
working. The European car industry's workforce is being drastically pruned.
Components suppliers are being squeezed harshly to cut their prices. As
overcapacity grows, companies are being forced to rationalise and
restructure.
Ford of Europe, once the Ford group's main profit generating machine
worldwide, has racked up losses of more than Dollars 2bn in the past two
years.
It was exposed earlier than its rivals by the long-lived recession in the
UK, its biggest market in Europe. Ford has already conceded that it will
remain in loss in Europe in 1993 for a third successive year, despite tough
steps begun late last year to restructure.
Ford is cutting the workforce of its European automotive operations
(excluding Jaguar) by 14.8 per cent, with the elimination of 14,400 jobs
between October 1992 and the end of 1993. The target is to reduce the
workforce to 83,000 from 97,400 over 15 months. The company acknowledges
that if the European economy continues to weaken, it may have to make
additional job cuts.
Fiat's car and light commercial vehicle operations (Fiat Auto) plunged into
an operating loss of L544bn (Pounds 229.72m) last year after a three-year
slide from an operating profit of L2,362bn in 1989.
With its domestic market share in Italy under heavy attack, and falling
market share across Europe, Fiat Auto had been forced to start cutting
production by late 1990. It eliminated output of 259,000 vehicles in 1991,
230,000 last year and 173,000 in the first six months this year alone. Its
workforce has been reduced from 133,431 in 1989 to 125,378 last year.
The Renault group of France managed almost to double its annual profits in
1992 and then to fall into loss in the final quarter, pushed down by the
turmoil in the European currency markets, its share of losses at its partner
Volvo, and the losses of its truck operations.
The most serious problems have emerged in Germany, however, where
Volkswagen, the group which has led the west European market in terms of
sales volumes for the past eight years, crashed badly into loss in the final
quarter last year. After making a pre-tax profit of DM1.2bn in the first
nine months last year, it fell into a pre-tax loss of DM563m in the final
quarter and has followed this with a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months of
1993.
In Europe, the rot set in during the final months of last year, as orders in
most European car markets suddenly began to shrink and carmakers were left
with bloated stocks and plants turned out cars for which there were no
customers.
According to James Capel, the UK financial analysts, 'the first quarter of
1993 has been the worst period for earnings (in the European car industry)
since the early 1980s and possibly for a period much longer than that'.
There was no improvement in car demand in the second quarter.
During the second half of the 1980s, new car sales in west Europe bounded
from one record year to another, with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to
13.47m in 1989. For another three years from 1990 to 1992 demand held
steady, near the record level of 13.5m.
Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well; demand
began to diverge wildly in the important markets. Sales in the UK, with the
early onset of recession, slumped by a third from the 1989 peak. Sales
faltered also in France. These setbacks were more than compensated for,
however, by the unprecedented surge in new car sales that took place in
Germany, Europe's biggest market, in the wake of unification of the
country's east and west.
Carmakers - most of all the Volkswagen group, which controls about 28 per
cent of the German market - were able to surfboard on the rising wave of
demand in Germany, where the car market surged from 2.8m in 1989 to 4.2m in
1991 and 3.9m last year.
But the German market, the driving force in Europe, has moved alarmingly
into reverse this year, and its fate has been shared elsewhere. Excepting
only the UK, new car markets across western Europe have seriously shrunk in
the first half of 1993.
Nearly 1.3m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe in the first six months
this year than in the corresponding period of 1992, as demand plunged by
17.2 per cent to around 6.1m according to industry estimates.
In July sales dropped by around 20.1 per cent further intensifying the
already steep decline suffered in the first half of the year. West Europe is
experiencing its sharpest fall in new car demand for more than a decade,
with sales in the first seven months drastically lower than a year ago in 16
of 17 markets.
The only significant gain has come in the UK with a rise of 9.1 per cent in
the first seven months, albeit from a very depressed level. In Germany sales
in the first seven months fell year-on-year by 20.6 per cent, in Italy the
decline was 23.6 per cent, in France 17.1 per cent and in Spain 27.7 per
cent.
Leading carmakers' latest forecasts suggest that sales could fall as low as
11.4m in the full year.
All carmakers in Europe are under fierce pressure. Only the UK's Rover
group, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, is increasing its European sales
in spite of the serious decline in the overall market.
The German industry is feeling the heat most intensely. By far the most
powerful in Europe, the German car industry had rested on its laurels for
too long. Now it is finding that a bloated cost-base has made it
disturbingly uncompetitive not only against Japanese carmakers but also
against its European rivals.
'Production costs in Germany are too high,' says Mr Erika Emmerich,
president of the German auto federation. 'The cause is labour costs as well
as energy, transport and environmental costs. Working hours are shorter than
in the auto industries of most other countries. And corporation tax is
higher than in our most important competing countries.'
Based on exchange rates last December German carmakers had total wage costs
of DM47 per hour, two-thirds higher than the average of DM28.3 in the rest
of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in the US and Japan at DM34.4 per
hour. German car workers clocked up only 1,483 hours in 1991 (the latest
figures available), a third less than the 2,181 hours worked by a Japanese
car worker, and 27 per cent less than their counterparts in the US at 2,022
hours. German annual working hours are also well below the UK (1,830 hours),
France (1,608) and Spain (1,654).
According to Mr Ferdinand Piech, the beleaguered chief executive of
Volkswagen, the group's current difficulties 'can only be blamed in small
part on the weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other
German manufacturers.
The cause is rather the structural problems of the entire sector, which are
now being openly exposed by the recession.
'We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do
our homework. Because as soon as sales fall we are in the red,' he says.
Intent on expanding its sales and market share at the expense of cutting fat
from the organisation and keeping costs under control, Volkswagen, the
European market leader, has become the continent's highest cost producer.
French carmakers have a 20 per cent cost advantage over the group, says Mr
Piech, and the Japanese a lead of 25-30 per cent.
Jobs are being cut. Last year's 7,500 reduction at VW's six domestic German
plants is to be followed by a cut of about 15,500 in 1993 and 1994. The
workforce at these plants will cut to 100,000 by the end of 1994.
Worldwide the group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, is cutting at
least 33,000 jobs in 1993/94 to 240,000.
Capital investments are being drastically reduced with a halving of planned
spending across the group and a virtual halt on investment at Audi and Seat
for the second half of the year.
Components suppliers are being put under severe pressure to cut prices with
some reporting demands for cuts of up to 30 per cent over the next three
years.
Volkswagen is not alone in having to resort to such drastic measures. In a
stunning departure from corporate tradition Mercedes-Benz, the world's most
prestigious luxury carmaker, is re-thinking the whole way it does business
with an 'extensive realignment of its strategic product policy' led by Mr
Helmut Werner, who took over as chief executive in May.
He admitted earlier this year that Mercedes-Benz's present luxury and
executive cars were 'over-engineered', and said that the company would end
up being priced out of world markets if it persisted with such a policy for
developing new models.
Mr Werner said the only way Mercedes-Benz could maintain its engineering and
quality leadership, was if it could also achieve cost leadership. Gone were
the days, when the charging of premium prices could cover for an
uncompetitive cost-base. 'No one in the world is prepared to pay for German
complacency on the cost front,' said Mr Werner.
About 13,000 jobs were cut by Mercedes-Benz last year in Germany (at its car
and commercial vehicle operations) reducing the workforce from 225,000 to
212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs are scheduled to be cut in
the next two years.
More vehicle assembly is being moved outside Germany to locations such as
Mexico, South Korea and Spain. Mercedes-Benz is also following BMW to the
US, where both groups are building their first passenger vehicle assembly
plants.
The pain of recession in Europe is being exacerbated by the building of
additional plant capacity across the continent. The new facilities were
planned as west European car producers were still basking in the years of
successive annual sales records. European producers are bringing into
production plants with a capacity for about 1.5m vehicles a year between
mid-1992 and the end of 1994, although VW has delayed part of its expansion
in eastern Germany.
Japanese vehicle makers are expected to have built a capacity in Europe for
about 1.2m vehicles a year by the end of the decade.
'The whole industry but European manufacturers in particular have to face
one particularly severe international challenge. This is worldwide
overcapacity,' says Mr Bruno Adelt, executive vice-president of the
Volkswagen brand division. 'For the remainder of the 1990s we estimate this
at more than 10m vehicles. . . Excess capacities in Europe will greatly
increase, competition will be tougher and above all pressure to sell at
lower prices will increase dramatically.'

NEW car sales worldwide are expected to contract by 3.0 per cent to 33.02m
this year, the second significant decline in the last three years under the
impact of sharply falling demand in west Europe and in Japan.
Global sales are forecast to recover next year, however, with a 5.4 per cent
rise to 34.8m. Continuing steady growth in the following years is expected
to take worldwide new car sales to 41.3m by 1998 according to the latest
World Automotive Forecast report by DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts.
Worldwide new car sales were virtually unchanged last year at 34.05m after
peaking at 35.01m in 1990. Sales fell by 3.3 per cent in 1991 to 33.9.
Much of the growth next year is forecast to come from North America, Asia
and east Europe. Car sales are already recovering in North America this year
with an increase of 4 per cent to 9.55m forecast to be followed by a further
rise of 6.1 per cent in 1994.
The strongest growth worldwide is expected to come from outside the leading
traditional car-consuming regions of west Europe, North America and Japan,
however.
While the DRI report forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand
from 1992 to 1998, the main impulses for this growth are expected to come
from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and east Europe during the
rest of the decade.
'The 1990s are expected to be a decade of structural changes in the pattern
of global car sales towards newly developing markets,' says DRI. The US is
already a mature market where new car sales are increasingly a function of
replacement demand, and the same will be true of west Europe by the end of
the decade.
The DRI report claims that the best prospects are in Asia-Pacific, where the
density of car ownership is still low, and strong economic development is
leading to rising disposable incomes.
New car sales in China more than doubled in 1992 to 321,000 from 145,000 in
1991, and sales are expected to triple in the next six years to reach 1.05m
by 1998. A similar development is forecast for Thailand with sales jumping
to 540,000 by 1998 from 121,000 last year and 66,000 in 1991.
Latin America and east Europe also offer good growth prospects, says the
report. By the mid-1990s, the Latin America is expected to be more than 2m,
nearly double the level of the mid-1980s.
As east Europe develops and used car imports fall away, new car sales in the
region are expected to grow by over 50 per cent in the next five years to 2m
a year.
The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main
focus for growth in car production for the rest of the 1990s with output set
to jump from 2.25m last year to 4.81m in 1998. China will account for a
large part of the increase with production forecast to rise from 171,000
last year to 950,000 in 1998.
After falling steeply for the last three years, car output in east Europe is
forecast to recover strongly for the rest of the 1990s with production
increasing from the low point of 1.47m last year to reach 2.65m by 1998.
The growth in newly developing markets has been unable to compensate in
recent years, however, for the downturn in demand in the main industrial
countries. The long upward trend in worldwide new car sales, was halted at
the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s first by the fall of
demand in the North American market and then by declining sales in Japan and
now in west Europe.
West European new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this year to
11.3m from 13.5m in 1992. The outlook for next year is also gloomy with the
prospect of only a minimal recovery.
The decline in west Europe in 1993 will be steeper than during the recession
following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. Sales in Germany, the
single largest market in Europe, are forecast to plunge by 22 per cent, with
demand expected to fall by 21 per cent in Italy, 26 per cent in Spain and 16
per cent in France.
The only market in west Europe that is showing any growth is the UK, albeit
from a very depressed level after three years of recession, with sales
forecast to rise to 1.77m from 1.59m in 1992.
There is little prospect of any sustained recovery in 1994 with sales in
west Europe forecast to rise by only 2.9 per cent next year to 11.66m.
Modest increases in demand in the UK, France and Spain are expected to be
offset by further small declines in Germany and Italy.
West European car production is set to fall by 2m vehicles or 15 per cent
this year to 11.4m from 13.4m in 1992, says the DRI report. Output is
unlikely to regain the 1989 peak of 13.7m until 1996 with the start of a
stronger recovery delayed until 1995.
The UK is an exception, however, with output boosted by the development of
the three Japanese car plants established by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. UK
car production is forecast to rise from 1.3m in 1992 to a record 2.1m in
1998.
By 1998 Japanese car production in the UK is expected to reach 800,000 cars
a year - accounting for around 37 per cent of total British car output and
allowing the UK to move from fifth to third place in the European production
league ahead of Spain and Italy.
Japanese carmakers have fallen under unaccustomed pressure in their domestic
market, where sales this year are suffering an unprecedented third
successive annual decline. The DRI report forecasts a six per cent drop this
year to 4.19m following declines of 8.5 per cent in 1992 and 4.6 per cent in
1991 from the peak of 5.1m cars sold in 1990.
Car production in Japan is expected to fall this year by 6.7 per cent to
8.75m from 9.4m last year and the peak of 9.95m in 1990. The impact on
production of weak domestic demand has been compounded by lower exports.
Shipments from Japan are being affected by the increase in Japanese
carmakers' overseas production in particular in North America and in Europe,
and also by the weakness of demand in Europe.
The Japanese car industry is in the lead in taking advantage of growth
elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, however, and shipments to other Asian
countries, led by China and Thailand, are becoming much more important in
terms of volume.
Japanese manufacturers 'will generally be looking to increase output in
locations outside of high-cost Japan, certainly as far as supplying exports
markets is concerned,' says DRI. 'At the same time, domestic market demand
will grow only modestly in the medium-term.'
In the US, fragile consumer confidence continues to threaten the pace of
recovery from recession, but car sales are rising again in 1993 after four
years of decline. Car sales (excluding light trucks) are forecast to rise by
around five per cent to 8.79m in 1993 but will still be nearly 3m units
below the 1986 peak.
The US light passenger vehicle market has been marked more and more by the
American fondness for light trucks, however, with four-wheel drive
leisure/utility vehicles, mini-vans (known as multi-purpose vehicles or MPVs
in Europe), and pickups increasingly substituting for family saloon cars.
US light truck sales are expected to jump by 14 per cent this year to 5.3m
units, easily surpassing the previous peak of 4.8m in 1988. While annual car
sales are forecast to rise by only 1.1m units from 1992 to 1998, light truck
sales are predicted to jump by more than 1.4m in this period to exceed 6m by
1998.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (1): A fierce fight for
survival - The recession has exposed severe problems within the world car
industry. In the battle to restructure there will be casualties

THE tables are being turned with a vengeance in the world motor industry.
After several years of intense pain, the big three US carmakers have
returned from losses, earning Dollars 2.3bn of net profit in the second
quarter of this year alone.
Now, it is the Japanese and European vehicle makers who are on the rack. As
sales fall, the losses are mounting. Nissan is in loss in Japan, as is
Volkswagen in Europe.
The fortunes of the US carmakers are improving as part of the gradual
recovery in the US economy, but the US auto industry turnround is more than
merely a cyclical recovery.
There is a new air of confidence in Detroit as General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler sense that a watershed has been reached in their battle to
restructure and to contain the advances of the previously all-conquering
Japanese vehicle makers.
Under heavy pressure from the rising value of the yen, Japanese producers
are being forced to raise their prices in the US much faster than their
American rivals. After a number of years in retreat US carmakers are
stemming the tide - at least for the moment - and it is their Japanese
rivals who are now being forced to cede market share in North America.
Symbolic of the changing order, the Ford Taurus last year ousted the Honda
Accord from the position it had held for three years as the best-selling car
in the US. The share of Japanese makes in the US car and light truck market
fell in 1992 to 24.3 per cent from 25.7 per cent a year earlier. In the
first seven months this year the Japanese share dropped away further to 22.3
per cent.
The US vehicle makers have benefitted in particular from the growing
popularity of light trucks - pickups, mini-vans and sport/utility vehicles -
which increasingly are replacing saloon cars for passenger use. The big
three dominate the US light truck market, where sales have jumped by 18 per
cent in the first seven months this year, compared with a rise of only three
per cent in new car sales.
The return to health of the US industry - signalled most emphatically by the
transformation of Chrysler's fortunes, whose share price has jumped fivefold
in the last 18 months - is still far from complete, however.
The big three carmakers face a difficult round of labour negotiations this
autumn, and General Motors, the wounded giant of the world auto industry, is
barely out of intensive care. After three turbulent years, GM's North
American automotive operations were still in the red in the first half of
1993 incurring a loss of Dollars 289m, although Mr Jack Smith, GM chief
executive, insists that the business can meet its target of a Dollars 4.5bn
turnround by breaking even at an operating level in the full year.
Japanese carmakers, under pressure in North America, are facing, too, an
unprecedented third successive annual decline in new car demand in their
domestic fastness, where imports still account for only four per cent of the
market. New car registrations in Japan this year are forecast to be 18 per
cent lower than in the peak year of 1990.
Several Japanese carmakers have fallen into loss, most notably Nissan, the
country's second largest vehicle producer, and Mazda. Toyota, the world's
richest carmaker and leader of the Japanese industry, has suffered three
years of falling profits and a further decline is expected this year.
Honda's pre-tax profits in the three months from April to June fell by 55
per cent.
The Japanese industry is being forced to restructure at a time when it is
burdened by high fixed costs and high depreciation, following recent years
of heavy capital expenditure and the building of new assembly capacity in
Japan. It no longer enjoys the advantages it had in earlier years of an
undervalued yen and cheap money. Plant closures are being forced, and
Nissan's drastic move to shut its Zama car plant in 1995 is unlikely to be
the last.
In contrast with the dramatic proliferation of new products at the end of
the 1980s, Japanese carmakers are now having to cut the number of model
variants and types of options offered, which in recent years have
'proliferated excessively' according to Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of
Nissan.
They are seeking to use more common parts among different car models, and
some are also planning to extend product life cycles - previously regarded
as one of the Japanese industry's key advantages over European and US car
makers.
Japanese vehicle makers are also being forced to make up for weaknesses in
their product armouries by marketing cars or niche vehicles from rival
makers under their own badges rather than trying to develop competing
products themselves.
Loss-making Isuzu has pulled out of carmaking altogether in order to
concentrate on four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicles and trucks. Instead
it will market a range of Honda cars under its badge in Japan, while Honda
is planning to sell Isuzu leisure/utility vehicles under the Honda badge
both in the US and in Japan. Honda also plans to sell in Japan the Rover
group's UK-built Land Rover Discovery four-wheel-drive vehicle under the
Honda name. Nissan and Mazda are exchanging light commercial vehicles in
Japan.
The spate of deals to share both vehicles and components appears to presage
a more far-reaching restructuring of the Japanese motor industry, as some of
the smaller makers are absorbed into the bigger groups, as has happened
already in Europe.
According to Mr Tsuji the Japanese motor industry 'may now be at a
structural crossroads'. The rapid appreciation of the yen would appear to
favour a further transfer of production abroad, but Mr Tsuji has voiced the
fear that such a move could entail a 'hollowing out' of industrial
operations in Japan. He has warned that 'the global motor industry is facing
a business climate of unprecedented severity.'
The Japanese vehicle makers continue, too, to face acute trade pressures as
the US pushes to reduce its huge deficit in automotive trade with Japan, and
the European Community seeks to restrain the volume of vehicles imported
from Japan in the face of plunging new car demand in Europe.
Faced by the accelerating contraction of the west European market the
established European producers have clamoured for intervention by Brussels
to renegotiate Japanese import levels.
'The agreements between the European Community and Japan are not enough,'
said Mr John Hardiman, until last month chief executive of Ford of Germany.
'We are deeply dissatisfied. . . We are demanding that Brussels sets
Japanese export quotas exactly in line with the actual development of the
market. . . You do not have to be a prophet to foresee that the goal of
orderly adjustment and a far-reaching restructuring of the European auto
industry cannot be reached by 1999.'
The real challenge is not so much the Japanese imports, however, as local
Japanese production in Europe, where Nissan, Toyota and Honda are already
showing that they can reach Japanese levels of quality and efficiency with
European (British) workforces, albeit in new plants and with new labour
agreements.
In west Europe the plunge in new car demand has been precipitous. Carmakers
are facing an even steeper decline in sales than occurred in the wake of the
first oil crisis in the early 1970s. Sales across 17 markets in west Europe
have fallen by an estimated 17.7 per cent in the first seven months of the
year with 1.5m fewer new cars sold than in the same period a year ago.
The most damaging falls have occurred in some of the biggest European
markets with sales in the first seven months dropping year-on-year by 21 per
cent in Germany, 24 per cent in Italy, 17 per cent in France and 28 per cent
in Spain. Only the UK, of the larger markets, has achieved any growth, with
sales rising by 9 per cent, albeit from a very depressed level after three
years of recession.
Large parts of the European industry have been forced on to short-time
working. The European auto industry's workforce is being drastically pruned,
components suppliers are being squeezed harshly to cut prices, and as
overcapacity grows, companies are being forced to rationalise and
restructure.
In an uncanny reflection of the earlier fate of General Motors in the US,
the Volkswagen group, the dominant leader of the European market, has
crashed heavily into the red with a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months of
1993. Ford of Europe will run up a third consecutive annual loss this year,
Fiat's car and light commercial vehicle operations suffered an operating
loss of L544bn (Dollars 339m) last year and their financial performance has
deteriorated further this year, while Renault's pre-tax profits plunged by
almost 90 per cent in the first six months this year.
The fight for survival in the global car industry has never been so fierce,
and the tensions have broken the surface in unprecedented fashion in the
ugly, bare-knuckle conflict between GM and VW over the US carmaker's
allegations of industrial espionage and the theft of thousands of highly
confidential documents during the departure of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, its former global purchasing director, to become Volkswagen's
head of production and purchasing.
What started as a bizarre tug-of-war over the services of Mr Lopez has
developed into a full-scale public battle between two of the world's biggest
industrial corporations, which still threatens unpredictable consequences
both for Volkswagen and for Mr Lopez and Mr Ferdinand Piech, the aggressive
and autocratic former head of Audi, who took over as chief executive of the
beleaguered VW group at the beginning of the year.
The Lopez saga, which has mesmerised the world auto industry, reached a
fresh climax two weeks ago with the raid by police and German public
prosecutors on the Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg. VW has already
admitted that GM documents have been shredded at one of its Wolfsburg
premises. The espionage allegations are also being investigated by the US
justice department.
The bitterness of the conflict between GM and VW has prompted interventions
by German Chancellor Mr Helmut Kohl and German Economics Minister Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, in an effort to contain the damage - but to little avail.
Mr Piech added fresh intensity to the conflict by accusing Opel, GM's German
subsidiary of mud-slinging and conducting an international war against VW
and Germany. He suggested that GM/Opel may have hacked into VW's computers
to plant secrets there. In return GM Europe has described the Piech attacks
as 'grotesque' and said the VW chief executive's war-like words suggested a
'psychosis-like bunker mentality.'
Mr Piech has claimed publicly that he is engaged in nothing less than a
mission to save the European auto industry and that Mr Lopez shares the same
messianic vision. His burning determination to bring the Spanish engineer
from GM to VW was not to be resisted.
The Lopez investigations are diverting top management attention from the
central issue of rescuing VW from its uncomfortable postion as the highest
cost volume carmaker in Europe.
Mr Piech has placed the blame for VW's precipitous collapse into loss firmly
on the group's previous management, with the onset of recession blamed only
in passing.
'The VW group's current difficulties can only be blamed in small part on the
weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other German
manufacturers,' he says. 'The real cause is much more the structural
problems of the entire sector, which are now being openly exposed by the
recession.
'We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do
our homework. Because as soon as sales fall we are in the red. Our task for
the coming years is to come to grips with this structural transformation.
'In eight years of boom we concentrated exclusively on expansion and we did
not prepare for bad times. We should break even with our plants working at
70 per cent or less of capacity. We came into this crisis with a break-even
level of around 100 per cent of capacity. From 1989 our sales volumes grew
every year and our profits shrank every year.'
Competitive pressures are being felt throughout the European auto industry
as it moves uncomfortably through the seven-year transitional period to a
west European car market, where all protection against Japanese imports is
supposed to have been removed by the end of the decade. The heat is most
intense in Germany, however, where vehicle makers were cushioned initially
by the surge in sales that followed reunification. This delayed the start of
restructuring.
The German automotive industry must shed a further 100,000 jobs and cut
costs by between 20 and 30 per cent in the next two years Mr Achim Diekmann,
chief executive of the German Automobile Federation, warned recently. German
vehicle and component makers had already cut 95,000 jobs in the two years to
the end of June, he said.
High costs in Germany have played an important role in decisions by both BMW
and Mercedes-Benz to develop new plants for passenger vehicles in the US,
and German components manufacturers are also increasingly moving capacity
abroad.
In a stunning departure from corporate tradition Mercedes-Benz, the world's
most prestigious luxury car maker, has embarked on 'a very extensive
realignment of its strategic product policy'. Mr Helmut Werner, who took
over as chief executive in May, admitted earlier this year that
Mercedes-Benz's present luxury and executive cars were 'over-engineered',
and said that the company would end up being 'priced-out' of world markets
if it persisted with such a policy for developing new models.
As the battle in Europe to restructure and to become globally competitive
intensifies, the industry faces the growing problem of overcapacity which is
'a major strategic concern' for all carmakers in Europe according to Mr
Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe. Ford does not expect new car
sales in west Europe to return to the trend level of 1990/91 until the late
1990s. 'The potential for excess capacity in the mid to late 1990s wil be
around 7m units,' Mr Nasser warned recently.
This amount of overcapacity would pose 'severe structural problems' for the
European auto industry, which would be compounded by a rising market share
gained by Japanese carmakers. This 'may result in continued losses or
severely depressed profitability for many manufacturers.'
As the Japanese build up their local production capacity Europe has become
the main battleground in the world auto industry.

FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More talk of a rights issue to accompany results from Cadbury Schweppes this
morning was heard. Rumour-mongers attempting to put more gloss on the story
were speculating that the company would be looking to raise an additional
Pounds 300m to buy either a beer producer in the US, or to increase its
stake in Dr Pepper.
Suggestions of a bid for United Biscuits also resurfaced amid the chatter.
However, Cadbury shares withstood the uncertainty, rallying to close 2 up at
470p in turnover of 2.2m. UB lost 8 to 376p.
Airtours shares moved forward 6 to 413p. Later in the session the company
announced it was changing its broker from BZW to Hoare Govett. It also
emerged that it was sacking its financial PR and adding Morgan Grenfell as
bankers. Earlier this year, Airtours narrowly lost a bitter battle for
control of rival holiday operator Owners Abroad. The latter's shares nudged
up a penny to 87p.
Pharmaceutical stocks slid in early trade, following weaker drug stocks in
the US and stronger sterling overnight.
Glaxo, which is to announce full-year figures today, fell 12 to 601p as
small investors in the US decided to take profits. SmithKline Beecham lost 7
1/2 to 444 1/2 p as US brokerage Wertheim Schroder published research
arguing that SmithKline's growth will slow dramatically. Wellcome shed 4 to
729p. The falls followed profit-taking in US drug stocks, including Merck,
Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer.
A strong pound, which rose almost two cents against the dollar on Tuesday to
its highest level for more than three months, depressed the translation
value of US earnings. The drugs sector had gained last week on a report
suggesting that the US government would not impose compulsory price controls
on health care companies in its forthcoming reforms.
The composite insurers bucked yesterday's lacklustre trend, with Royal
Insurance particularly buoyant after announcing the Dollars 59m disposal of
its US subsidiary. The shares gained 10 at 317p.
Media conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, rose after
BSkyB, in which Pearson has an interest of 17.5 per cent, unveiled first
full-year profits of Pounds 62.3m before interest payments. Also, SG Warburg
raised its 12-month forecast for the share price by 80p to 620p. Pearson
shares closed 12 higher at 529p and Granada, which also has a stake in the
satellite TV channel, put on 3 at 445p.
Carlton Communications, whose video duplication business is likely to suffer
from the new pay per view video services that have been discussed by BSkyB,
fell 12 to 752p.
Oil issues slipped in reaction to lower crude prices, which fell sharply
after the International Energy Agency cut global demand forecasts on
Tuesday, and on concern about an Opec meeting in Geneva on September 25.
Enterprise led the fall, losing 12 at 475p after a good run in the past
three weeks. Shell was down 5 at 658p and BP 4 1/2 to 299 1/2 p.
British Gas was firm ahead of first-half results due today, closing 1 1/2
ahead at 329 1/2 p. The company announced last month that it expected to
report a profit of not less than Pounds 503m on a current cost basis, after
Pounds 498m a year ago, and Pounds 634m on an historical cost basis, after
Pounds 635m.
Stores shares responded to reports of continued recovery in retail sales.
Kleinwort Benson was also steering investors in search of short term gain
towards selected consumer shares. Among stores stocks, Boots moved ahead 8
to 493p, GUS 38 to 2103p and WH Smith 'A' 4 to 458p.
With the army and navy equipment exhibition currently being held in
Aldershot, VSEL were in demand and the shares climbed 11 to 877p, with
several investors having visited the company at the show.
Bargain hunters reassessed Williams Holdings, whose figures earlier this
week had disappointed the market. The shares recovered 4 to 330p in volume
of 2.7m.
Shares in British Airways put on 6 at 367p in active trade of 5.9m, with
Kleinwort Benson said to have recommended the stock. Ocean Group
disappointed the market by reporting interim figures unchanged from a year
earlier at Pounds 20.8m and a dividend held at 4.7p. The shares lost 9 to
325p.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, fell 5 to 718p ahead of first-half
results today.
General trader Inchcape gained 3 at 563p as Gartmore, the investment fund,
announced it had increased its stake to 4.01 per cent.
UK Land, which underwent a financial reconstruction involving a 22-for-one
rights issue on Tuesday, continued to rally sharply. After opening at 1 3/4
p on Tuesday and closing at 29 1/2 p, the stock advanced 20 1/2 yesterday to
finish at 51p.
Nervous trading in international conglomerate BTR left the shares 2 lighter
at 399p ahead of today's figures. Volume was 4.3m at the close.
Agency broker Panmure Gordon was said to have advised investors to sell
Cookson group. The shares relinquished 4 to 211p.

News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings jumped in late
trading as US buyers, unable to find stock in their home market, bought
through the London market ahead of a key presentation in New York.
Dealers who trade between New York and London reported sharp interest from
Merrill Lynch and several small US brokers which boosted the share price by
26 to 1544p.
Senior Reuters board members will give a seminar in New York to analysts
early next week to discuss the company's forthcoming projects.

FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blenheim drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession in continental Europe lay behind a sharp fall in the share
price of Blenheim, the conference and exhibitions organiser, which dropped
43 to 355p, a two-year low.
Blenheim announced an 18 per cent rise in first-half profits to Pounds
15.4m, but the company generates much of its profits from France. It said
yesterday: 'There have been some signs of revival in the economies of the US
and UK but those of France and Germany have continued to deteriorate.'
The statement upset a number of analysts' forecasts, and Blenheim's broker
BZW cut its 1994 prediction by Pounds 11m to Pounds 43m. Reed International,
which is also heavily exposed to European exhibitions, fell 11 to 700p.

FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: P &amp; O hit by profit revisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT and property group Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P &amp;
O) suffered a steep drop after the company stunned the market by reporting
interim figures significantly below the worst market forecasts.
Profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 80.1m, against a restated Pounds 89.9m.
The range of forecasts was Pounds 95m to Pounds 130m. The shares initially
hardened a penny to 669p as dealers appreciated the fact that the company
was to make a much predicted enhanced scrip dividend alternative.
However, this brief optimism turned to gloom as analysts were presented with
a poor view of the near term outlook at their meeting with the board. Aside
from the disappointing profits, researchers were particularly concerned by
the higher than expected debt levels, the prospect of stiffer competition
from the Channel tunnel next year, and overcapacity in the container
shipping market.
As securities houses downgraded current and following year's forecasts, the
shares dropped 49 to 619p in hefty trade of 16m, the highest daily total
since 1989, with income funds said to have been the day's biggest sellers.
Analysts were particularly angry that the company had given no indication of
the state of current trading, several complaining that this could have been
covered when the company met them in June.
Mr Mike Stoddard at Charter house Tilney, who reduced his year-end forecast
by Pounds 28m to Pounds 225m, said: 'It appears the City confused the
company's long term optimism with the state of current trading.'
UBS was said to have cut its forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 250m, while
Nikko was believed to have reduced its estimate by Pounds 25m to 245m.

FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rally peters out before trading
closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURABLE report on the domestic economy from the UK Treasury helped the
London stock market rally from early weakness yesterday. But the FT-SE 100
Index was edging lower in the final minutes after a mixed set of company
trading announcements left the market nervous ahead of what promises to be a
test of market confidence today.
Suggestions of a large rights issue in the food manufacturing sector this
morning subdued traders, who were already cautious ahead of today's profits
statements from Glaxo, British Gas and RTZ, as well as the meeting of the
Bundesbank policy committee.
A highly disappointing interim profits report from P &amp; O, the cross-Channel
ferries operator and property group, was received badly. But this was
balanced by better news from Wimpey, the housebuilder, and from Prudential,
the blue chip insurance group.
In early deals, equities gave ground sharply, albeit without suffering any
great selling pressure. The Footsie lost a further 16.5, bringing it down to
3,022.1 and increasing traders' concern over the depth of the shakeout seen
since last week's peak.
However, a rally then set in which gathered pace for a while after the
latest monthly report from the UK Treasury stressed the falls in real
interest rates in the UK, downward pressures on inflation and rising retail
sales.
The early losses in share prices were recovered and the Footsie only just
failed to move into positive territory, helped by firmness in the government
bond market as sterling improved behind the Treasury's report. But later in
the session, a weak opening on Wall Street, down 14 Dow points in London
hours, left UK stocks to drift off again for a final close on the FT-SE 100
of 3,035.4, a loss of 3.2 on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 7.8 to
3,462.4.
Seaq trading volume dipped to 600.3m shares, from 626.2m on Tuesday, when
customer, or retail, business made a good recovery after Wall Street's
closure on Monday, to return a value total of Pounds 1.35bn. This compares
well with the turnover levels seen at the market peak. Non-Footsie shares
were active yesterday, representing about 62 per cent of the Seaq total.
The London market was held back by continued weakness in the pharmaceuticals
sector, which took its lead from a fall in Glaxo ahead of the trading
report. Oil shares, too, reacted to lack of support for crude oil prices.
Domestic consumer and retail sectors tried to respond to the favourable
comments from the UK Treasury but gains were mostly modest and were trimmed
back before the close. The telecommunications sector, shaken up on Tuesday
by Mercury's plans to increase competition in the mobile phones market,
steadied.
Analysts were disinclined to pronounce on the prospects of a cut in rates by
the Bundesbank today, although some claimed that nothing short of a full
point cut in discount rate would have much effect on the London market.
The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee yesterday approved the following
constituent changes to the FT-SE 100 Index, to take effect on Monday,
September 20. Additions: MEPC, Rolls-Royce, Schroders. Deletions: De La Rue,
Tate &amp; Lyle, Scottish Hydro-Electric.

FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN the futures market remained in familiar territory yesterday as
dealers tried, in good two-way business, to anticipate the outcome of
today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Christopher Price.
After a weak opening, the September Footsie contract moved slowly forward in
what were described as squeezy conditions, with some eyes fixed on next
week's expiry date. There was more evidence of investors rolling positions
into the December contract, where volume yesterday reached more than 3,000
contracts.
The Treasury report and firm gilts and short sterling, together with some
continued optimism that good news may be forthcoming from Germany today,
helped to sustain the rally, and September led the cash market higher in the
morning session, although the good two-way business saw some volatile
swings.
A high for the day of 3,049 was reached shortly after midday, after which
September drifted back slightly, eventually closing at 3,036, around three
points ahead of the underlying cash market. Volume was a steady 11,474
contracts.
The options market recorded a strong 40,000 contracts, with the FT-SE 100
option accounting for 15,000. BTR, which reports results today, saw 5,500
contracts traded. Amstrad was also busy, with 1,795 lots dealt, as were BT,
British Gas, Glaxo and National Westminster Bank.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign demand fuels Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN equities showed fresh strength at midsession in response to
foreign demand, but lost some ground later on moderate profit-taking.
The Bovespa index was finally a net 133, or 1.1 per cent, ahead at 11,751,
after touching 12,236.
Equities have been attracting interest after the government announced its
intention to tackle inflation, currently at a monthly level of 34 per cent,
by adopting fiscal reform measures and accelerating the privatisation
programme.
BUENOS AIRES reversed a fresh retreat on profit-taking to close higher on
the day in response to late news of the approval by key Senate committees of
a draft for a pensions reform bill.
The weighted Merval index, which initially lost 3 per cent, finished a net 1
per cent up at 482.60.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs take toll on US
markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
HEAVY profit-taking and computerised sell programs continued to take a toll
on US stock markets yesterday, although late buying caused share prices to
pick up from the day's lows, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 18.17 down at 3,588.93. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.87 to 456.65, while the American SE
composite shed 5.20 to 451.08 and the Nasdaq composite lost 8.62 at 730.73.
New York SE volume was heavy at 283m shares.
Prices opened lower across the board as the markets failed to rally from
Tuesday's losses, when a late surge of sell programs sent the Dow tumbling
more than 26 points. Although stocks just about held their own for the first
2 1/2 hours of trading, slightly before midday another round of sell
programs, and heavy profit-taking in all markets, prompted sizeable losses.
The late buying helped to bring prices back from their lows in the final
hour of trading.
The day's economic news - the publication of the Federal Reserve's Beige
Book report on the economy - had little effect on sentiment. The Beige Book
reported that the economy grew at a 'slow to moderate' pace in late-July and
August.
Investors also ignored fresh gains in the rallying Treasury market, where
longer dated securities rose sharply, pushing the yield on the benchmark
30-year government bond down to an historic low of 5.858 per cent.
Among individual sectors, drug and healthcare stocks, which rallied last
week when President Bill Clinton backed down from his original proposals to
impose price controls on drug and health services companies, took a beating.
Pfizer declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 62, Merck Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
31 3/4 , Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 3/8 and Schering-Plough
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 .
Warner-Lambert fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 1/4 , undermined by a
ratings downgrade from brokerage house Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
Health care shares on the Nasdaq market were also sharply lower. US
Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 44, Pacificare Health Dollars 5 3/4
to Dollars 34 and Oxford Health Plans Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 .
Baxter International slid Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 22 7/8 in volume of 4.7m
shares after the company warned that its third-quarter earnings would come
in below those reported a year ago. Baxter also announced plans to freeze
employee salaries and cut senior managers' pay by as much as 25 per cent.
Selected bank stocks remained a rare bright area, buoyed by falling interest
rates and renewed interest in the recently neglected sector. BankAmerica
rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 1/2 , Citicorp Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 33
3/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 .
Nasdaq technology issues fluctuated wildly. After declining almost Dollars 2
in early trading, Intel rebounded to end Dollars 1 up on balance at Dollars
63.
Canada
TORONTO plunged for the second straight day as the market continued its
correction after the recent run-up that took it to record high levels.
The TSE 300 index closed 70.8 lower at 3,952.9 for a two-day drop of 173
points. The index fell to just below 3,930 in mid-afternoon before staging a
modest recovery. Falls outnumbered rises by 647 to 150 after volume of 67.6m
shares.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei cautious as Hong
Kong sets record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING caution following a spate of downward corporate earnings
revisions depressed activity, and the Nikkei average lost marginal ground,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 43.91 easier at 20,918.19, its third consecutive
decline. Small-lot selling by individuals, investment trusts and securities
houses pulled the index down.
Investors reacted to Tuesday's announcement by Nippon Steel, which now
expects to fall into a loss for the current business year.
The index slipped to the day's low of 20,816.78 in the morning. However,
afternoon support from arbitrage-linked buying pushed it up to the session's
high of 20,996.50.
Volume totalled 298m shares, against Tuesday's 251m. Foreign investors, who
had previously been active buyers, held the sidelines.
Declines outscored rises by 586 to 391, with 193 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 6.96 at 1,682.82, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.09 to 1,288.57.
Reports that Nikko Kyodo, a leading mining and oil refiner, had decided to
liquidate its US subsidiaries depressed sentiment. The company expects to
post losses of Y90bn due to the liquidation.
Nikko Kyodo was the most active issue of the day, falling Y35 to Y510. Other
oil issues fared poorly, with Mitsubishi Oil shedding Y20 to Y1,030 and
Showa Shell Sekiyu Y10 to Y1,260.
Steel companies were weak on the unexpected downward earnings revision by
Nippon Steel, announced on Tuesday. The company said it would skip its
interim dividend and would post a pre-tax loss of Y15bn for the current year
to next March.
Other leading steel issues, including Kobe Steel, NKK, Kawasaki Steel and
Sumitomo Metal Industries, are scheduled to make similar announcements
tomorrow.
Nippon Steel retreated Y7 to Y360 and Kobe Steel declined Y9 to Y308.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y11,000 to Y930,000, declining for the
fifth trading day in a row.
The company said it would cut its long distance call rates, and it revised
down its revenue for the current year by Y100bn.
Ink and printing concerns were higher. Dainippon Ink moved up Y4 to Y544 and
Dai Nippon Printing gained Y20 at Y1,710.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 47.09 to 22,871.14 in volume of 38m
shares. Trading remained inactive ahead of Friday's settlements for
September futures and options contracts.
Roundup
MIXED messages emerged from Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG investors decided that they had been marking time for long enough
and a wave of afternoon buying took the Hang Seng index up 60.42 to a record
close of 7,607.13.
The rise came as Sino-British friction took a back seat to comments by Mr
Zhu Rongji, the Chinese vice-premier, that the country's economic growth was
likely to be 13 per cent this year, in spite of the current austerity
policy.
Hopewell, the most active issue, advanced 20 cents to HKDollars 5.50 and was
followed by Jardine Matheson, which gained HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 65.
Hong Kong Electric moved ahead 60 cents to HKDollars 21.40.
MANILA was helped by heavy foreign buying of Manila Electric, and the
composite index rose 4.28 to 1,886.28.
NEW ZEALAND benefited from better than expected Air New Zealand results,
enabling the NZSE-40 capital index to overcome early weakness and close 4.56
higher at 2,000.35. Air New Zealand rose 13 cents to a year's peak of
NZDollars 2.75.
AUSTRALIA took its lead from the sharp falls on Wall Street and in the
bullion price, and shares were marked lower from the opening. Some support
emerged for blue chips at noon before investors again took profits towards
the close. The All Ordinaries index finished 28.3, or 1.4 per cent, lower at
1,939.5, while the golds marker ended 127.8, or 7 per cent, down at 1,897.2.
Among gold stocks, North Flinders Mines shed 70 cents to ADollars 12.50 and
Plutonic Resources fell 31 cents to ADollars 6.60.
SINGAPORE was lower for the second consecutive day as profits were again
taken after the recent sharp rises. The Straits Times Industrial index fell
7.74 to 2,028.96.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Strong week for Latin American markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America's emerging markets performed well last week, with Colombia and
Venezuela in particular coming to the fore, while there were also good rises
in the Philippines, Malaysia and Portugal.
US funds have been flowing into Latin America recently, seeking out
underperforming markets and attracted by the general recovery in economic
fundamentals.
Mr Federico Laffan, of Latin American Securities, comments that Colombia,
has been driven higher recently by a flow of funds from large US
institutions. As a consequence turnover has risen from around Dollars 2.5m a
day in the first half of the year, to some Dollars 4m.
Foreign money, he adds, has been attracted to Columbia since equities there
have lagged other regional markets, while prices are also cheap.
Inflation has been coming down, and GDP growth is forecast for 1993 at
between 4 to 4.5 per cent, after 3 per cent in 1992, when the economy was
affected by a severe drought.
Among the smaller European bourses, Portugal has enjoyed a rally since May,
coinciding with the devaluation of the escudo. According to the data
provided by the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, the market has shown a
43 per cent improvement on the year to date in dollar terms, making it the
fourth best performer in the list.
Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie International says that initial gains in the
market had been led by US investors, attracted by lower interest rates and
good earnings prospects from 1995.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses unable to make
much headway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses drifted yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw a weak start as the options and futures market dragged
equities to a DAX index intraday low of 1,865, before recovering just before
the close to 1,885.29.
Traders reported that selling accelerated when the DAX broke a support level
at 1,880, although they added that the market had been looking overbought
and was due for a correction. Turnover improved slightly to DM7bn from
Tuesday's low DM6.3bn.
In an absence of corporate news, VW again attracted attention, particularly
given conflicting statements from the group's senior management. The shares
added DM1.40 to DM362.90 after Mr Ferdinand Piech said that a dividend would
probably be resumed in 1994.
PARIS fell back modestly, the CAC-40 index shedding 7.85 to 2,129.44 in
turnover of FFr3.2bn.
A further batch of interim results affected share performances:
CarnaudMetalbox lost FFr10.50 to FFr198.50 after reporting that it saw no
improvement in profits for the rest of the year, and Valeo gained FFr20 to
FFr986 reflecting satisfaction with first half figures. Mr Bob Barber of
James Capel, reiterating his sell recommendation, noted that it was
difficult to believe Valeo shares could outperform the market 'at a time
when the prospects for companies in the sector are generally being regarded
with growing caution and ahead of what we believe will be a downward
reaction in the price of automotive shares'.
AMSTERDAM experienced a further correction, with the CBS Tendency index
falling 2.5 or 2 per cent at 123.9 in good turnover.
The market had a second look at Ahold's results and marked the shares down
Fl 3.50 at Fl 87.70, while a fall in Grolsch of Fl 1.70 to Fl 39.30 on
disappointment with its interims, dragged Heineken off Fl 4.10 to Fl 182.30.
Bols Wessanen was down Fl 1.50 to Fl 42.20 ahead of today's results.
MILAN remained on a downward track, not helped by program selling ahead of
tomorrow's options expiry, and the Comit index shed 15.57 or 2.6 per cent to
594.18.
Bank privatisation candidates came under pressure following the news that
IRI, the state holding company, planned to sell them off by public offering
and not through a competitive tender. BCI shed L234 or 4.4 per cent to
L5,126 while Credito Italiano was L25 easier at L2,700.
Ferruzzi, however, shrugged off local press reports that details of its
rescue plan would be delayed until the end of this month. The shares
continued their recent advance, rising L41 or 10 per cent to L452.75.
ZURICH spent an uncertain session, with investors mixed on the prospects for
lower interest rates and the SMI index dipped 5.5 to 2,397.9.
Nestle registered shares were steady at SFr1,072 in active trading with
analysts expecting a moderate growth in half year profits to be announced
today.
STOCKHOLM retreated further as Volvo Bs lost another SKr11 to SKr447. The
Affarsvarlden general index declined 12.3 to 1,272.1 in turnover of
SKr1.3bn.
COPENHAGEN took little notice of a 0.5 point cut in the central bank's key
14 day rate to 10 per cent with analysts suggesting that further cuts would
be needed before the present, positive undertone turned into a rally. The
KFX index shed 0.9 to 98.95 in moderate turnover of DKr601m.
VIENNA fell 4 per cent amid further profit-taking after the market's strong
run and on renewed concern ahead of results due shortly from OMV. The ATX
index tumbled 41.36 to 970.81.
OMV shed Sch42 to Sch755, after a day's low of Sch735, as local press
comment suggested that the group faced heavy losses and could be forced to
restructure its chemicals operations.
ATHENS bounced back after Tuesday's slide as the prospects of an early
election receded. The general index which was 2 per cent higher for much of
the day received a late fillip which took it 40.25 or 4.9 per cent higher to
861.15 at the close.
ISTANBUL continued in record-setting mood, in spite of some late
profit-taking after an early rally which saw the composite index over the
13,000 level. The index finished 198.4 or 1.6 per cent higher at 12,725, for
a 9.2 per cent rise since the start of the week.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Overnight rate at 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVERNIGHT interest rate in the sterling cash market was quoted as high
as 20 per cent yesterday after some of the leading players in the market
refused to offer bills to the Bank of England at the start of trading,
writes James Blitz.
There was a lack of liquidity in the market after the Bank of England
forecast a comparatively large shortage of Pounds 2.35bn. Only Pounds 315m
of bills were offered in the early round and it was not until the afternoon
session that the bulk of the shortage was removed.
Banks and discount houses borrowed Pounds 730m via the 'late assistance'
window, at which it is suspected that they pay punitively high interest
rates.
Yesterday's difficult conditions appeared to be the result of several
factors which are again causing concern to discount house dealers and
commercial banks in London.
The shortages in recent months have become very large because of the
government's huge sales of gilts to fund its Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement. At the same time, one or two UK clearing banks are thought to
have built up a substantial share of the sterling bill market in the wake of
changes in the Bank of England's reserve requirements in the late 1980s.
Dealers say that this gives them the power to dictate the overnight rate
level, depending on the state of their lending positions.
Yesterday's conditions pushed up three-month money by  1/32 percentage point
to 5 29/32 per cent.
One dealer also said that they contributed to a fall in sterling interest
rate futures, with the December contract closing 4 basis points down at
94.42.
By chance, conditions in the German market were not much of a recommendation
for the repo system of money manage-ment either.
German call money jumped a full percentage point to 7.75 per cent after
commercial banks bought far fewer funds from the Bundesbank at the
prevailing repo rate of 6.80 per cent.
The German market was again locked into the same mentality that dogged it
before the last Bundesbank meeting.
Dealers believed that the discount rate would be cut today and preferred to
borrow funds through the discount window. There was a larger drain of funds
from the market than had been expected.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: More optimism on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR edged forward against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers appeared a
little more optimistic about the prospect of an official interest rate cut
by the Bundesbank today, writes James Blitz.
There was no indication from the German central bank that it was thinking of
reducing the interest rate floor, currently at 6.75 per cent. But German
commercial banks appeared optimistic yesterday that there would be an
easing, and did not bid for funds aggressively at the established repo rate
of 6.80 per cent in the weekly money market operation.
This had an impact on the currency markets, where one London dealer talked
of 'mild position-squaring' by dealers. The dollar closed at DM1.6190 from a
previous DM1.6105.
The dollar strengthened more sharply against the yen, as dealers continued
to ponder whether Japan would introduce a substantial fiscal stimulus later
this year as part of a deal with the US. The US unit rose to Y105.65 from
Y104.00.
In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6145 and Y105.53.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, thinks the
dollar will not fall far this week, whatever the Bundesbank does. He
believes that no change in rates would lead to only modest profit-taking on
the downside. A cut of 25 or 50 basis points would push the dollar up
modestly.
But Mr Cocker is one of the growing number of economists who think the
dollar is heading for a more substantial fall in the next three months,
possibly to as low as DM1.35. In his view, there is little chance of the
Federal Reserve tightening policy before the end of the year or of a
significant German easing. But more importantly, fund managers are still
heavily overweight in dollars. 'When we get to the DM1.56 or DM1.55 level,
fund managers will seriously take a look at their dollar weightings,' he
said.
In the European crosses, sterling again dominated events, moving up sharply
in the wake of a particularly encouraging monthly monetary report from the
UK Treasury. The Treasury remained bullish about prospects for growth,
saying that recent figures pointed to 'very encouraging trends'. This helped
the pound to rise a pfennig to a close of DM2.4950.
The performance of other European currencies was mixed. The Belgian franc
slipped sharply against the D-Mark at one stage amid new reports of the
country's formidable economic problems. The Belgian franc fell to a low of
BFr21.7500 from a previous BFr21.6300. Some economists spoke of the
prospects of the BFr22 level being broken soon.
The French franc was less troubled, closing at FFr3.521 from a previous
FFr3.519. The Danish krone was unaffected by a cut in the country's key
interest rate of  1/2 percentage point. This was another example of how
European central banks do not harm their currencies when they ease policy.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan mobilises locust
defences - A battle that many villagers fear is a lost cause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE sun rises over the village of Mithi, on the Pakistani border of the
Thar desert, an ominous silence is broken only by the tinkling of bells tied
around the necks of goats and camels coming out of a nearby valley, followed
by bare-footed herdsmen in torn clothes.
'Makhar aayo' shouts one suddenly - 'the locusts have come' - and all eyes
turn towards a band of hundreds of pink insects flying off some nearby
trees.
A few miles up the desert track, villagers wait for the bus to take them to
irrigated sugar-cane fields in search of seasonal jobs. They have seen a
drought this year followed by the locust invasion, and fears of widespread
fodder shortages are gradually convincing many to migrate, at least until
the locust attack is past.
Aerial and ground sprays have left grim reminders of the potential
catastrophe that haunts them. For miles around the road-side is littered
with dead yellow hoppers and pink locusts in the flying stage. But the
problem is far from over.
The scene is only one example of Pakistan's most recent emergency in the
agriculture sector. The scale of the problem is huge, claimed by some to be
the worst locust plague in more than three decades.
The government this week called in the army to help with the monitoring of
locust bands and with aerial spraying, after the department of agriculture
found itself unable to meet the challenge. According to official estimates,
at least 47,000 bands of locusts have been eliminated in spraying over an
area of about 12,000 sq km. But that is only a small portion of the massive
task at hand. At least 50,000 sq km of desert land in Thar (Sindh) and
Cholistan (Punjab), remains as a breeding ground for the voracious insects.
Shortage of equipment and pesticides has raised concerns that the defence
operation will prove futile. Pakistani experts expect more swarmlets to
arrive from India by the middle of this month, amid fears of heavy breeding
currently in progress there.
The desert is the last frontier before lush prime farmland begins, and with
Pakistan's prime cotton land at the greatest risk western experts and some
officials fear that the shortages have caused irrecoverable delay in
launching the operation. Mr Ali Khan Junejo, agriculture minister, said this
week, that the attack could become 'terrible' if allowed to spread. Earlier,
Pakistani senators bitterly criticised their government's inaction.
Despite the criticism, some government officials defend their position. Mr
MB Mohsin, one of the government's most senior entomologists, says: 'A lot
of swarms came, but none of them could come out of the desert. This is proof
that we acted in time.'
Mr Mohsin is confident that the attack will be contained in the desert. He
also denies that there are any shortages of pesticides. But many local
villagers see the fight as a lost cause. 'The spray planes come here every
day,' says Mr Bhai Khan, a herdsman, 'but so do more and more locusts'. Mr
Haji Mohammad, a local school teacher comments: 'The agriculture people have
mostly gone to areas close to roads and tracks. But out in the distant
valleys the locusts have destroyed crops and grass'.
Some lower-level agriculture officials share these concerns. One junior
government entomologist says the equipment and pesticide shortage has caused
the most serious setback. 'We need at least 100 exhaust vehicles, we have
only 15. How can we fight like this.'
Some pesticides have been supplied in assistance from bilateral donor
agencies and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. Some officials
fear, however, that unless a massive operation is launched with all the
required resources delivered within the next couple of weeks, the locusts
may cross the desert and penetrate inland. How much crop damage would result
is anybody's guess.
According to government forecasts earlier this year, Pakistan expected to
produce up to 12m bales of cotton from its current crop. Some officials say
this must be now lowered to 11m bales, but only as a starting point for
assessing the possible damage caused by the locust invasion.
Whatever the final outcome, the catastrophe for the desert herdsmen has
already taken place. For some, it may be years before they can repair their
livelihoods, which were at a minimum subsistence level to start with.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Veteran diamond chief resigns
'because of ill health'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VALERY Rudakov, the veteran chief of Russia's diamond industry, has
resigned citing ill-health, and has been replaced by a senior official from
Yakutia, the semi-independent region that produces the country's diamonds.
His successor, elected by shareholders including the Yakut government, is Mr
Andrei Kirillin, deputy chairman of the Yakut parliament, which has been
pushing for ever greater independence from Moscow.
But Mr Sergei Ulin, deputy chairman of Almazy-Rossii Sakha the
state-dominated corporation responsible for the production and marketing of
Russian diamonds, denied that there were any political motives for Mr
Rudakov's departure.
However, another official, who declined to be identified, said the
resignation may have been triggered by conflicts between Mr Rudakov and
Yakut authorities increasingly eager to wrest remaining control of the
industry from Moscow-based Russian authorities. 'He is a strong-willed man
and he is not the kind to give in to demands, especially stupid ones,' the
official said.
Before heading ARS, Mr Rudakov was in charge of Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet
state gold and diamonds monopoly, which was subsequently broken up into
separate corporations for diamonds and gold.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply fears push cocoa prices
to three-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES surged to their highest level for over 3 years in London
yesterday fuelled by continued fears that the Ivory Coast's harvest will be
lower than expected, leading to a shortfall in world supply.
The price spike came on the eve of the International Cocoa Organisation's
talks in London on the operation of its new producers' agreement, which will
try to bring supply and demand more closely into line.
The price of the December cocoa futures contract on the London Commodity
Exchange rose in hectic trading by Pounds 31 to Pounds 862 a tonne - its
highest point since June 1990. About 16,000 contracts had changed hands by
the close of the market, still way below the record of 46,458 lots set on
June 22.
'The market has realised cocoa prices have just been too low for too long
and maybe this is just the beginning of a big move,' said Mr Tony Chadwick
at Prudential Bache.
The cocoa market has recently been reacting to reports that this year's crop
from the Ivory Coast, which produces around a third of the world's cocoa,
will not be as good as expected.
A poor harvest - which begins on October 1 - will push world supplies lower
than demand for the third season in a row.
One reason for the shortfall is that prices have been so low in recent
years, they have not encouraged producers to invest in production, resulting
in the current poor crops.
Mr Tony Harrison from Mars who is chairman of the European cocoa industrial
users body, Caobisco, says there is a pressing need for producers meeting in
London today to discuss ways of matching world supply with demand.
'I'm not arguing for higher prices, but we want to see a sustained supply
and these prices have not been encouraging that,' he said. World demand has
been rising by between 3 and 5 per cent a year.
The 40 nations represented at the talks in London will also try to agree a
way to dispose of some 230,000 tonnes of buffer stocks held from the
market-stabilising International Cocoa Agreement, which expired this year.
They are expected to agree a way of releasing some 4,000 tonnes of cocoa to
the market each month over four and a half years at prices prevailing in the
market.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI, the London trade house,
believes that the way in which the buffer stock liquidation is decided could
have an effect on prices.
But traders have been anticipating the outcome for some weeks and most of
them believe it has already been discounted.

ROBUSTA COFFEE futures prices rose by Dollars 20 a tonne on the London
Commodity Exchange yesterday with the November contract closing at Dollars
1,268 a tonne, after touching a fresh 2 1/2 -year high of Dollars 1,285 a
tonne during the day.
The sharp run-up in coffee prices over the past couple of days reflects a
tightness in supplies of good quality beans to be delivered against the
September contract.
Market sentiment was also buoyed by the decision of Indonesia to join other
producers in the coffee retention scheme, which makes the agreement more of
a global one.
Brazil has fought off a challenge by Colombia to its traditional position as
the world's leading coffee exporter, according to figures released this week
by the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febec), writes Bill
Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
It had appeared that Brazil would be outperformed by its north-western
neighbour for the July-June season. But a rebound in Brazilian shipments in
June, pushing monthly exports back over the 1m bags mark, helped the country
to regain its world leadership.
Brazil shipped 15.9m bags (60kg each) compared with Colombia's 15.7m during
the 12 month period ending in June. World exports were 76.5m bags. During
the 1991-92 season, Brazil exported 21.9m bags, compared with Colombia's
14.6m. World exports that season totalled 76.4m bags
The Brazilian resurgence is continuing. The country exported 1.4m bags in
July, the highest monthly figure this year. August shipments should have
reached 1.5m, according to preliminary estimates compiled by Febec.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME moves to relieve copper
'squeeze'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange last night took emergency action in response to
widespread suggestions that its 'flagship' copper market, on which most
contracts around the world are based, was being manipulated to boost the
price.
It said the daily backwardation (premium over the future price for metal for
immediate delivery) was to be limited to Dollars 5 a tonne.
After an LME board meeting, Mr David King, chief executive,strode on to the
trading floor at 3.30pm London time to announce the details.
He said later that the board had also authorised him to take any further
action that might be needed to ensure an orderly copper market.
The LME board's intervention was widely expected because two formal warnings
had already been given that action might be taken to end the squeeze.
In similar circumstances in the copper and zinc markets in the past the LME
has imposed limits on daily backwardations.
'This should have come as a surprise to no-one,' said Mr Nick Moore, analyst
at the Ord Minnett financial services company. 'So there should be no
squeals from traders. But, once again, it helps those who are short of metal
to get out of a tight spot.'
Many traders suggested that Sumitomo, the Japanese group, has been
responsible for the supply tightness building up this summer, possibly in
preparation for a large sale of physical copper deal. Sumitomo denied it was
manipulating the market.
Mr King said yesterday that the backwardation now imposed until further
notice took account of both present prices and the level of trading. Dealers
said the premiums for key dates, such as next week's September delivery date
and October 7 and 8, have varied but they have never been much above Dollars
7 a tonne.
After the LME's move copper for immediate delivery closed down Dollars 15.50
a tonne at Dollars 1,986 and three-month copper was down Dollars 19 at
Dollars 1,928. Analysts suggested that, with a lacklustre world economy and
LME stocks at a 15-year peak, copper had further to fall when the 'squeeze'
ended.

Charts show mixed pictures for precious metals after yesterday's nervous
base-building in the wake of technically-inspired selling on Tuesday,
analysts said. As the London bullion market GOLD price fell another Dollars
2.50 to Dollars 351.75 a troy ounce traders said the the downside risk was
relatively limited. 'The break through Dollars 360 was important,' said Ms
Elli Gifford, analyst at Investment Research of Cambridge. But she thought
the Dollars 350 mark was 'not particularly significant'. She said the market
was 'oversold' and 'the real support doesn't begin until Dollars 340'. Mr
David Kerly, senior analyst with Chart Analysis, thought an early return to
the high prices seen a month ago, was unlikely. 'So much damage has been
done that it will really take time for confidence to be re-built,' he said.
PLATINUM had the weakest chart background, according to Ms Gifford, with the
downside stretching from the current Dollars 357/Dollars 358 an ounce range
down to about Dollars 340. But Mr Kerly saw platinum coming into support in
the January-April 1993 trading range at closer to Dollars 350, about Dollars
10 below the present level.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US likely to lower grain and
soya estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMODITY TRADERS are expecting the US Department of Agriculture to reduce
its estimates for the wheat, soyabean, and maize harvests when it releases
the results of its September crop survey this afternoon.
However, the figures are unlikely to boost grain prices, as futures fund
managers, who control huge commodity investments, have already allowed for
the reductions.
Although respected private crop forecasters like Memphis-based Sparks
Commodities lowered their own crop estimates last Friday, soyabean prices
tumbled to their lowest levels since June 30 after Monday's Labour Day
holiday. The slide came as weather forecasts predicted fair harvesting
weather for the week, and fund managers, made nervous by losses in gold,
sold off holdings of other commodities.
Tumbling oil prices and interest rates have eased inflation concerns, making
investments in physical commodities less attractive. Commodities are often
held in portfolios as inflation hedges.
Based on its August 1 survey, the USDA estimated maize production at 7.423bn
bushels and soyabean production at 1.902bn bushels. Sparks lowered its
estimates to 7.316bn bushels for maize and 1.869bn bushels for soyabeans in
advance of today's report. Another prominent consulting group broadcast
harvest estimates as low as 7.294bn bushels for maize and 1.848bn bushels
for soyabeans.
While analysts expect the government to reduce its production estimates
today, they say the October crop survey, conducted later in the harvest, is
likely to restore some of the lost bushels. 'History dictates that October
estimates are higher than September's, at least in non-drought years,' says
Mr Richard Lowey, president of the market consulting firm, AgResources.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia signals further cut in
oil production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORECAST of Russian oil production with grim implications for both Russia
and the former Soviet states was presented to the energy ministers of the
states in Moscow yesterday.
The oil industry forecasting group, Asotek, told them it expected crude oil
production in Russia in 1994 to be 327m tonnes - sharply down on this year's
forecast figure of 340-350m tonnes. Refined products should reach 225m
tonnes in 1994 compared with 254.6m tonnes in 1992, it said.
Asotek said it would not be possible to stop the decline in oil production,
which has been falling steadily for five years. However, it could be
'significantly slowed' through the programme of co-operation and investment
agreed between nearly all the former Soviet states.
According to Tass, the official news agency, Mr Nikolai Pravednikov, head of
Asotek, told the gathering that the expected level of production next year
would cover Russia's consumption but would not be sufficient to supply other
former Soviet states. Russia has cut back on cheap oil supplies to its
neighbours but has not moved to full world pricing of oil exports to its
closest partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The ray of light was that gas production was forecast to rise by 10bn to
12bn cubic metres, to 650bn-660bn cu m in 1994.
The co-operating states - Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan - have agreed to pool
investment in energy resources and to create joint ventures for the proving
and developing of oil supplies. However, the poverty of most of them has so
far limited the co-operation - while the Russian oil managers continue to
throw cold water on most projects that would bring in foreign oil companies.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated US Treasury yields dip to
record lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE extraordinary rally in longer-dated US Treasury securities showed no
signs of faltering yesterday, with yields dropping to new historic lows as
traders continued to execute yield curve-flattening trades.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105
15/32 , yielding 5.858 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.759 per cent.
For the second consecutive day prices at opposite ends of the maturity
spectrum moved in different directions, primarily because dealers were
selling shorter-dated securities and buying bonds in a strategy aimed at
flattening the yield curve.
The short end was also undermined by Tuesday's comments from Federal Reserve
chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, who told a senior Congressman that real
short-term interest rates were lower than appropriate.
MOST European bond markets traded nervously in technical ranges as dealers
focused on today's meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council.
Market participants appear evenly split over the likelihood of a cut in
Germany's 6.75 per cent discount rate.
A global bond market survey conducted by analysis firm IDEA shows that 38
per cent of respondents expect a discount-rate cut this week, 38 per cent
expect it at the next meeting on September 23, and 24 per cent forecast an
October cut. Some 80 per cent of those who see an easing expect a  1/2
 point rate cut.
AFTER a steady start, German bond futures weakened in the afternoon as
traders worried that a German rate cut could spark a sell-off after the
recent rally which has left bunds technically overbought.
In the past, rate cuts have often triggered profit-taking while unchanged
rates have supported prices as players shifted their easing hopes to the
following meeting. Now, traders worry a cut in rates today may put off the
next easing for a while. Also, they fear the Bundesbank may leave the repo
rate unchanged at 6.80 per cent, keeping the impact of a rate cut to the
bare minimum. The December bund future traded on Liffe ended 0.12 point
lower at 98.52.
However, strong demand for 10-year cash bonds pushed the 6 1/2 per cent
10-year benchmark some 0.10 point higher. The DM4.03bn tranche of these
bonds auctioned yesterday was snapped up by investors although the issue
price of an average 102.73 was deemed expensive. Retail demand was so strong
that it left many banks short, according to traders. 'Retail took everything
 -there's about a DM2bn shortage out there,' said a London dealer.
GILTS continued to firm early in the day on technical and retail buying but
shed most of their early gains in the afternoon to end only slightly firmer.
Prices remain underpinned by the same scenario that has been fuelling the US
bond rally: economic recovery accompanied by low inflation. Buying fizzled
out in the afternoon, however, after the December long gilt future failed to
break key technical resistance and closed at 114.03, up 0.01 point from
Tuesday.
IN THE French bond market, cash investors were sidelined ahead of the
Bundesbank Council meeting and ceded the stage to professional futures
players.
Traders tried to push the September notional bond future on the Matif
futures exchange to a new high. While the December contract did post a new
high at 123.72, the September future reached 123.94, four ticks short of its
historical peak. A breach of 123.98 would have triggered heavy buying,
according to dealers, but failure to do so caused profit-taking and the
contract slipped to close at 123.58, up 0.06 point.
WHILE the long end of the Belgian yield curve was steady the shorter
maturities were very volatile, buffeted by swings in the currency on the
foreign exchanges. Prices of short-to medium-dated bonds jumped nearly a
point in the morning, only to shed these gains in the afternoon on fears
that unchanged German rates today could put further pressure on the Belgian
franc.
JUST before the close of a range-bound trading day, the Japanese bond future
jumped. Traders tried to push the contract through 112.00. But the contract
peaked at 111.99 and slipped back on profit-taking, leaving it to close 0.18
point higher on the day at 111.84.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Traffic builds up on the
Access trading highway - Laurie Morse examines the after-hours trading
system's modest success while the fate of Globex remains uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RIVAL Chicago derivatives exchanges battle over the future of Globex, the
after-hours electronic futures trading system, the New York Mercantile
Exchange's Access computer system is building volume quietly.
The Access system, launched in June, trades energy futures contracts
overnight, and is currently confined to about 80 subscribers in the US, with
10 Access terminals scheduled to become operational in London late this
month.
In comparison with Globex, which carries financial contracts from three
exchanges across 350 terminals on three continents, Access is a modest
undertaking. Globex was developed jointly by Reuters, the Chicago Board of
Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange at a cost of Dollars 78m, while
Access, which offers only Nymex products, was set up at a fraction of that
cost.
It is being closely watched, however, because it is the first electronic
highway for 24-hour trading in global commodities - crude oil futures and
other energy derivatives.
Turnover on Access is slim but respectable, averaging below 2,000 contracts
per night. Traders who track the system expect volume to grow, but say that
it will not eclipse floor trading in New York or at the International
Petroleum Exchange in London.
Access traded 53,805 contracts in July and August, slightly behind Globex's
61,010 volume for its first two months of operation in July and August last
year, but above Nymex's conservative expectations.
North American oil traders are using the system to update futures positions
at the start of trading in other time zones; Nymex data show Access is
busiest between 6pm and 8pm New York time, and between 4am and 8am. Very
little volume is generated between 8pm and 4am, when New York and London
markets are closed.
While Access enjoys its modest success, the Globex partnership appears to be
torn asunder by recriminations. Last month the Chicago Board of Trade was
accused by its Globex partners, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters,
of blocking Globex's expansion. CBOT officials have retorted that Reuters
has been slow to respond to Globex users' needs, and that Reuters' Globex
fees are far more expensive than those for its own local system, called
Project A.
CBOT directors widened the rift recently by supporting a referendum that
could put the CBOT's active Treasury bond and note futures on Project A,
rather than Globex, during late afternoon hours.
As the CBOT backs away from Globex, its Chicago rival, the CME, is working
hard to promote the system. Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the CME and of
Globex, is planning a fresh marketing push for Globex, and announced on
Tuesday that the CME would add its stock index futures contracts to the
system on September 20.
While Globex has expanded steadily this year, little growth has originated
in the US. Of 566,725 contracts traded on Globex in August, 87 per cent was
generated by Paris's Matif, which is phasing out its own local after-hours
computer trading system.
The fate of Globex, and the direction of innovative technology within the
futures industry, are likely to be prime topics at the international
gathering of futures officials and derivatives regulators in Burgenstock,
Switzerland, which starts today.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Success for World Bank's Dollars 1.25bn
global offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank had the stage to itself for the successful launch of its
ninth dollar global bond offering yesterday, as the rest of the
international bond market paused after the heavy issuance on Tuesday.
The World Bank's Dollars 1.25bn offering of 10-year global bonds was priced
to yield 10 basis points over the yield on the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury
due 2003, at the lower end of the indicated range.
This is the tightest yield spread over US Treasuries which the World Bank
has achieved on its 10-year dollar global bonds, according to the joint lead
managers, Lehman Brothers and Nomura International.
This partly reflects the general tightening of spreads in the market as well
as the fact that the offering was significantly over-subscribed. Yesterday's
issue is likely to be the World Bank's last global dollar bond until next
autumn.
The tight spread and the balanced distribution worldwide also show that the
World Bank has achieved the main aims of its global bond programme which was
launched four years ago. They were to achieve a truly global distribution
and a single world price for its bonds.
'The widespread sales reflect the realisation of the global bond concept,'
said Mr Peter Horvath, senior financial officer in the World Bank's
financial operations department.
Just over 40 per cent of the offering was placed in Japan and eastern Asia,
and the remainder was sold in virtually equal amounts in Europe and the US.
The bonds were trading at 99.53-99.58 yesterday, representing a narrow
bid-offer spread of just five basis points.
Another goal of the global bond programme has been to raise the World Bank's
profile within the US, and the large US allocation in yesterday's offering
indicates that this has been accomplished. 'The World Bank is now in the
same category as US federal agencies,' said Lehman Brothers.
Meanwhile, Chinese finance ministry officials were in London yesterday on
the last leg of their international roadshow to publicise the People's
Republic of China's forthcoming Y30bn five-year Eurobond offering.
The offering, via Nomura International, is likely to be launched this
morning, and the bonds could be priced to yield between 75 and 85 basis
points over the yield on underlying Japanese government bonds.
This is China's second Eurobond offering - it raised DM300m through a
five-year deal in 1987 which has since expired - and also marks its return
to the international bond market since the Tiananmen Square massacre in
1989.
Mr Zhao Xiaoyu, divisional head of the finance ministry's foreign affairs
department, said the offering's aim was to re-establish China's name in the
international bond market.
The proceeds of the issue will be kept in yen and will be used to finance
various infrastructure projects. The repayment of the bonds would be
incorporated into the budgets of those projects, said Mr Gao Jian, deputy
director at the finance ministry's state debt management department.
China has an indicated investment grade rating of BBB from Standard &amp; Poor's
and Baa1 from Moody's. Moody's is understood to be reviewing its rating
following a meeting with Chinese finance ministry officials.
Elsewhere, Dhana Siam Finance and Securities Company was the second Thai
borrower in less than a week to tap the Eurodollar sector with a convertible
bond. The issue is part of a general drive to widen the ownership of Thai
shares. An official at the lead manager CSFB said the bonds will be priced
early next week.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Honda put under credit review by
S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE credit rating of Honda, the Japanese car group, was yesterday placed
under review for a possible downgrade by Moody's, the international credit
rating agency.
The move was expected, following last month's announcement by Standard &amp;
Poor's that it is reviewing the credit ratings of Honda, as well as Nissan
and Toyota, because of poor domestic demand and the damage to export price
competitiveness inflicted by the yen's strength.
Moody's gave similar reasons for reviewing Honda, which reported a 41 per
cent profits fall in the year to June. Honda's exports form a higher
proportion of total sales than is the case for Nissan and Toyota.
The agency said it would examine the group's ability to use its US and
European plants to offset the erosion of its price competitiveness outside
Japan. It would study the implications of this strategy for Honda's domestic
manufacturing and employment base and assess the outlook for new car
launches.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: New chairman shows legal cool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE loss of six board directors in as many days, the announcement of a
ADollars 256.8m bottom-line loss, and the need to grapple with more than
ADollars 1bn worth of balance sheet debt, might seem like a severe headache
for anyone. But Fred Millar, former senior partner of a Sydney law firm and
now faced with the unenviable task of leading Australian transport
conglomerate TNT out of its troubles, was playing it cool yesterday.
'If I could be assured of as much fun as I've been having recently, I'd stay
on forever,' the new chairman remarked, with only a hint of sarcasm, when
the question of his own tenure was raised.
Shareholders may be slightly less sanguine. While the past week's boardroom
upheavals at the transport group have helped to clarify the future strategy,
analysts have few doubts that there is an uphill task ahead. TNT shares,
which were trading at over ADollars 3 in the late 1980s, now stand at
ADollars 1.38. Dividends were axed last year, and are unlikely to restart
before 1995.
Perhaps the least of TNT's problems are now in the boardroom. Last week's
departure of Sir Peter Abeles, the rags-to-riches tycoon who arrived from
Hungary in 1949 and quickly built up the Alltran trucking company which
later merged with Thomas Nationwide Transport, marks the end of an era.
Sir Peter, colourful and controversial, once ruled TNT in autocratic style,
but stepped down as managing director last year. His dramatic departure from
the board last week - along with four other directors - followed
disagreements over how the group should tackle its parlous balance sheet.
The net result was to leave control firmly in the hands of Mr Millar and
TNT's new, lower profile managing director, Mr David Mortimer.
Yesterday, Mr Millar indicated that some of the boardroom vacancies will be
filled, but that the total number of directors would probably shrink.
Much more delicate, even without Sir Peter's distracting influence, is the
question of how TNT addresses its debt burden. According to Mr Mortimer, net
debt on the balance sheet stands at around ADollars 1.12bn. More than
ADollars 400m falls due for repayment in the current year, and a similar
amount in fiscal 1995.
Mr Mortimer's solution centres on a continued asset sale programme, which
has already raised some ADollars 220m, and which should bring in another
ADollars 200m over the next 12 months. On top of that, Commonwealth Bank of
Australia last week provided a new ADollars 252m facility, and TNT has said
that it is 'actively exploring opportunities for a significant capital
raising'. Mr Mortimer is not inclined to talk about timing or numbers - but
rumours of some form of quasi-equity offering in the ADollars 300m range
have circulated recently.
Will that suffice? 'Fiscal 1994 has never been the problem,' said one
analyst at Baring Brothers yesterday. 'The question has always been 1995.
With the CBA facility, they're some way towards helping the situation.'
The third challenge is operating performance. Here, analysts saw some
grounds for encouragement in the latest figures. The large bottom-line
losses contained some hefty abnormal items, and TNT was quick to stress that
there was a slim ADollars 14.2m operating profit before these charges (on an
equity-accounted basis). This compared with a ADollars 75m operating deficit
in the previous 12 months.
But, examined more closely, the results concealed some mixed performances.
On the plus side, the Australian freight and transport operations were back
in the black, while the domestic freight operations in Germany, Italy and
the UK held their ground and contributed satisfactorily. The same could not
be said for the Spanish business, whose deterioration was blamed largely on
the economy. Meanwhile, TNT's share of the losses at GD Express Worldwide,
its 50 per cent-owned international express freight venture, stood at
ADollars 48.3m before abnormal items.
On the last front, TNT says that an eight-part restructuring plan is being
implemented, aimed at cutting costs and improving efficiency. The objective
is to eliminate losses by June 1995. Whether that is possible remains to be
seen.
The final piece of good news, meanwhile, was a positive contribution from
Ansett, the airline business owned jointly by TNT and Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation. Accordingly, TNT is no longer in a hurry to leave the business,
saying that its 50 per cent holding is 'not considered for sale,' although
the company does back plans to bring new investors into Ansett. In fact, Mr
Millar was keen to emphasise the point: 'Ansett is not causing TNT any
problem at the moment,' he said firmly, seeming relieved to be spared one
headache at least.

revenue climbs

<TEXT>
AIR New Zealand yesterday announced a 21.2 per cent increase in profits to
NZDollars 139.5m (USDollars 76.6m) for the year ended June, helped by higher
revenue on its routes to Asia, the US and Europe.
Directors said that while the airline continued to outperform most of its
international competitors, returns were still less than needed to
appropriately reward shareholders and finance growth.
The profit was some NZDollars 15m higher than analysts had been expecting,
and the improvement was unexpectedly helped by abnormal gains of NZDollars
3.7m. Last year the airline reported abnormal losses of NZDollars 13.1m.
Air NZ, whose major shareholders are Brierley Investments and Qantas,
reported operating earnings of NZDollars 140.3m, against NZDollars 134.3m.
Equity accounted losses of associates were NZDollars 4.5m, against NZDollars
6m.
Directors said that the group was budgeting for further growth in passenger
traffic on Asian routes. However, it expected little if any growth on
internal routes or services to Australia and only modest growth in the UK,
Europe and US traffic.
The company said it had successfully handled an increase in 8.9 per cent in
additional capacity.
The dividend is being maintained at an unchanged six cents a share, bringing
the total to 10 cents this year.

KITTAKA, a Japanese chain store operator, has filed for protection under the
bankruptcy law, becoming the second convenience store operator to seek court
protection in the past three months.
Unlike other retailers, Japan's convenience stores have held up well against
a background of sharp falls in consumer spending. However, increasing
competition and poor summer weather have started to hurt some convenience
store operators.
Although not stock market listed, Kittaka's Kei-Mart convenience store chain
is one of the large scale national chains, with 1,098 outlets.
According to Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, the company
has liabilities totalling Y33bn (Dollars 317m).
Teikoku said Kittaka suffered from intensive competition. In July, Niko
Mart, also an unlisted convenience store chain, filed for court protection
after expanding its operations too quickly.
Meanwhile, two leading supermarkets have revised down their profit estimates
following a long rainy season and an unusually cool summer.
Ito-Yokado, said annual pre-tax profits would remain flat at Y97.5bn rather
than a 2 per cent rise to Y99.5bn, while Nichii expects annual pre-tax
profits to fall 17 per cent to Y20bn rather than a 4 per cent increase to
Y25.2bn.

restructure US subsidiary

<TEXT>
NIKKO Kyodo, the Japanese mining and oil refining group, plans to
restructure Gould, its US electronics subsidiary and the world's largest
manufacturer of copper foil, which it bought five years ago for Dollars
1.1bn.
Nikko will liquidate Gould and its stock holding company, Nippon Mining US,
and transfer Gould's operations to two new companies it will set up in the
US.
The move by the Japanese company, which was formed in December last year
through the merger of Nippon Mining and Kyodo Oil, reflects difficulties in
turning round Gould.
Gould, which was acquired by Nippon Mining, has suffered a downturn in its
main businesses and run up heavy debts.
Nikko Kyodo will book an extraordinary loss of Y90bn (Dollars 865m) due to
the liquidation of the company. As a result it has revised downwards
after-tax profits to Y4bn from Y33bn. The company's shares yesterday fell 6
per cent to Y510.
The US company has had problems with its semiconductor and defence
electronics businesses for a number of years. Nippon Mining has invested
about Y100bn in Gould which has chalked up recurring losses of Dollars 440m
and debts of Dollars 890m.
Nikko will set up Gould Electronics to take on Gould's copper foil and fuses
businesses and Gould Instruments to carry on its measuring instruments
operations.
The Japanese company said that it had not changed its view that Gould's
businesses were crucial to group long-term strategy.

TNT, the Australian transport group which saw five directors resign last
week after a boardroom disagreement, yesterday announced an operating loss
after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 256.7m (USDollars 171.1m) for the
year ended June, on an equity-accounted basis. This compares with a ADollars
195.4m deficit 12 months earlier.
However, the large loss stemmed partly from some sizeable abnormal items.
TNT said that its operating loss before these items, but after tax, stood at
ADollars 44.7m, compared with a loss of Dollars 100m in 1991-92.
Before tax, the company made a small operating profit of ADollars 14.2m, in
contrast to last time's deficit of ADollars 75m.
Last year TNT's revenues fell from ADollars 6.06bn, to ADollars 5.52bn. The
company said this was due to the flotation of TNT Freight-ways in February
1992, and the creation of the international express delivery business GD
Express Worldwide as a joint venture in October 1991.
Abnormal items, after tax, amounted to ADollars 212m, up from ADollars 95.4m
in the previous year. Included in these charges were a write-down of future
income tax benefits, to comply with a new accounting standard; unrealised
foreign currency losses; provisions related to the carrying value of the
Sydney Monorail, and a further, previously-announced provision related to GD
Express Worldwide.
TNT announced yesterday that Mr Morley Koffman had resigned from the board
due to personal commitments and his inability regularly to attend board
meetings in Australia, although he will remain non-executive chairman of TNT
Canada.
Mr Morley Koffman is the sixth director to quit recently. Last week, Sir
Peter Abeles, TNT's co-founder, and four other board members left after a
disagreement about future company strategy.

network of professional partnerships.'
The two companies planned to offer an additional flight between Frankfurt

This means that there would be a daily non-stop flight to Sao Paulo as well
as five flights to Rio de Janeiro, Deutsche Lufthansa said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German electronics group Siemens said its Automotive Systems Group will
make a small profit in the year ending September 30 for the first time since
it was founded in 1984, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Juergen Mache, board member in the division, told a news conference
1992/93 earnings were barely above break-even point, but said Siemens did
not give figures for its different business sectors.
Mr Franz Wressnigg, division chairman, said it expected a 'comparatively
modest business result' for 1992/93.
Despite a worldwide sales slump in the car industry and increasing price
pressures on suppliers, orders received will reach last year's DM2.6bn
(Dollars 1.56bn) while sales will increase to slightly over the DM2.5bn seen
in 1991/92, Mr Wressnigg said.
The division had made losses in recent years, he added.
Domestic business had levelled off, although foreign business was growing as
the US market improved, Mr Wressnigg said. In Siemens' core area of
automotive electronics it saw solid growth this year, with unit sales of
anti-lock braking system electronics more than doubling.
Research and development expenditure, currently some 12 per cent of sales,
had grown slightly, while the workforce of over 13,000 had remained steady.
A company spokesman said Siemens' group turnover in the traffic and
transport sectors overall amounted to DM8bn, some 10 per cent of group
sales.
The group also said it was expanding its automotive systems production
facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and hoped to open a plant for
heating and air-conditioning systems in the Czech city of Rakovnik.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOP management at McCain Foods, the international frozen-foods group owned
by Canada's McCain family, is riven with discord, according to documents
filed in a New Brunswick court yesterday.
The documents were submitted by Mr Wallace McCain, joint chief executive, in
support of his efforts to overturn a resolution by McCain's board last month
to oust him as president and chief executive by September 30. The court is
due to hear Mr McCain's application later this month.
Mr McCain's action is directed primarily against his older brother and
co-CEO, Harrison, whom he alleges has persistently undermined a plan put in
place two years ago to provide for an orderly succession at the top of the
company.
Both McCains are in their mid-60s. Two other brothers have died, but several
of the four men's sons are also active in the business. Wallace's son
Michael runs McCain's US subsidiary. Until the dispute surfaced. Michael was
widely assumed to be a front-runner for the CEO job when his father and
uncle step down.
McCain, with sales of about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn), is the world's
largest potato-chip producer, with 20 factories in North America, Europe and
Australia. Other products include frozen juices and pizzas.
McCain's business has prospered even during the recession. But the documents
filed yesterday show that the family has become increasingly pre-occupied in
recent years with the succession issue.
Harrison wrote to one of his nephews last September that, 'Wallace and I are
no longer a single team running the McCain Group. A happy situation which
for 30 years saw us agreeing appropriate courses of action, mutually
supporting each other and letting each have a veto over important decisions
has been substantially fractured.'
Wallace denies this, saying in an affidavit that 'we continue to operate in
our respective spheres quite effectively and independently of each other'.
Protracted negotiations over the past six months to solve the succession
dispute have come to naught. They have culminated in Wallace making a
CDollars 1bn offer to buy the McCain shares not already held by his branch
of the family.
Wallace and Harrison each own one-third of the McCain group's shares, with
the rest divided among the families of their two deceased brothers.
As an alternative, Wallace has also proposed splitting the company in two
roughly equal parts, with him acquiring the operations in North and South
America and Asia, which he presently oversees. Harrison would take over the
UK and European businesses.
Harrison has so far rejected these overtures and, instead, has spearheaded
the efforts to remove Wallace from his present position. Harrison is due to
file his defence to Wallace's claims by September 13.

<TEXT>
A SHAREHOLDER of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up has filed a suit against the company and
its directors in Delaware Chancery Court alleging they have breached their
fiduciary duties by thwarting a possible bid for the company's shares,
Reuter reports.
Dr Pepper recently adopted a 'poison pill' defence against a possible
hostile takeover attempt by Cadbury Schweppes, the UK confectionery and soft
drinks group.
In August, Cadbury said it was buying a 20.2 per cent stake in Dr Pepper. It
has not ruled out a bid sometime in the future.
Dr Pepper said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at assuring
holders are treated fairly should a takeover become imminent.
The company said the plan was not intended to prevent a takeover on terms
beneficial to shareholders.
The Delaware suit was filed last Friday and made public yesterday. It asked
the court for a preliminary injunction as soon as possible.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Takeover of Rentsch by Canon
fuels bid debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANON has become the latest bidder to take advantage of the absence of
effective Swiss takeover regulations.
The large Japanese office equipment group has agreed to purchase the
controlling 50.7 per cent stake in Walter Rentsch, a quoted Swiss office
equipment distributor and retailer, from Mr Hubert Looser. Terms have not
yet been finalised. However, no offer is being made to minority
shareholders.
This is the fourth such case in three years of minority shareholders of
Swiss companies being ignored or offered inferior terms in takeover bids.
The others were the Philip Morris takeover of confectionery group Jacobs
Suchard in 1990; the purchase by Mr August von Fink in early 1992 of the
controlling stake in the hotel and restaurant group Movenpick; and the
takeover of the controlling holding in Kardex last year by Industrieholding
Cham.
Each case has provoked criticism in Swiss stock market circles, and new
legislation to eliminate discrimination against minority shareholders is
being considered.
Mr H. J. Scheffer, manager of EC affairs for Canon Europe in Amsterdam, said
yesterday the company's move was 'in line with Swiss practice'. It saw no
reasonable ground for objections.
One Swiss analyst suggested there could be a conflict of interest in that
Canon products accounted for up to 70 per cent of Rentsch sales. The
Japanese group might in the future arrange transfer pricing of its products
to the detriment of the Swiss company's profits, he suggested.
Mr Jurg Zimmerman, chief executive of Rentsch, said the potential for
manipulation was virtually nil, not only for legal reasons, but also because
of the intense international competition in the office electronics sector.
Mr Zimmerman pointed out that Canon reserved the option to make a subsequent
offer to minority shareholders.

BRAZILIAN government officials were yesterday discussing anti-trust
implications of the acquisition of Cosipa, the recently-privatised Brazilian
steel producer, by Usiminas.
If approved by the government, the sale would give Usiminas, itself
privatised in 1991, control over 61 per cent of Brazilian output in flat
rolled steel and all of its output in heavy steel plates, said Mr Rui
Coutinho de Nascimento, president of the Administrative Council for the
Defence of the Economy (CADE).
Mr Coutinho was yesterday discussing the situation with Brazil's minister of
mines and energy, Mr Paulino Cicero.
The acquisition of Cosipa by Usiminas could be annulled if CADE, the justice
ministry agency responsible for anti-trust investigations, decides that the
deal would result in over-concentration in the steel industry, said the
offi-cial.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VALEO, the French maker of car components, showed resistance to the downturn
in the European car market by announcing first-half net profits of FFr383m
(Dollars 68m), a fall of 6.1 per cent over the same period last year.
The company said the result was achieved despite the depressed European car
market and reflected improved operating profit margins outside Europe and
the benefits of its cost-cutting programme. The results included
extraordinary charges of FFr223m.
Sales during the first six months of 1993 fell by 4.6 per cent to
FFr10.59bn. Valeo said that most of this decline was the result of exchange
rate movements and was achieved against a background of an 18 per cent fall
in the European automotive market.
Valeo ascribed the relative strength of sales to expanding technology and
the growing internationalisation of its operations.
The company said the continued depressed outlook for the European car market
meant that it would pursue its policy of industrial and commercial
adjustments and would seek to strengthen its position in growth markets such
as Asia and the US.
The company's balance sheet strengthened during the period. At the end of
June, net consolidated debt stood at FFr1.77bn compared with FFr2.15bn at
the beginning of the year.
The debt to equity ratio declined from 30 per cent to 23 per cent during the
same period.
Spending on research and development during the first half was FFr531m,
while capital expenditure was FFr636m.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Moody's returns Chrysler debt to
investment grade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US carmaker, reached a significant milestone on its path back
to financial health when Moody's Investors Service, the credit information
agency, restored its debt to investment grade status after 31 months in the
speculative category.
The upgrading concerns some Dollars 13bn of borrowings.
Moody's is one of the two leading credit rating agencies. Its upgrade should
allow Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services business, to raise
money on somewhat finer terms, although the debt market is already pricing
the subsidiary's borrowings at close to investment status.
However, Chrysler also needs an investment grade rating from Standard &amp;
Poor's, the other leading agency, to achieve a significant reduction in
interest costs on some of its other borrowings.
S&amp;P announced in June it was reviewing the company for a possible upgrade to
investment status. However, Mr Scott Sprinzen, an S&amp;P analyst, said
yesterday the agency would not finish its review until Chrysler had
completed this autumn's negotiations with the United Auto Workers on a new
labour contract.
Chrysler fell to junk bond status early in 1991 when it was entering a
severe industry recession with a weak product line-up and strained balance
sheet. Many analysts questioned whether it could survive as an independent
company.
Over the past 18 months it has clawed its way back to financial health,
thanks to asset sales, cost-cutting and a range of hot-selling new products.
Moody's, which raised Chrysler's senior debt two notches to Baa3 from Ba2,
said the ratings remained under review for a further upgrade. This would
depend partly on the outcome of the labour negotiations.
It said yesterday's action 'recognised the improving trends in Chrysler's
operating performance' and the potential for 'further earnings and cashflow
advances which will strengthen the company's balance sheet and
debt-protection measurements'.

<TEXT>
HELLENIC Bottling Company, the Coca-Cola franchise-holder for Greece,
Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, increased operating profits for the first
half of 1993 by 18.1 per cent to Dr9.1bn (Dollars 39.6m).
Turnover in the first half rose by 29.8 per cent to Dr54.7bn, partly due to
the first-time consolidation of HBC's operation in Bulgaria, where it has
invested almost Dollars 20m in five joint ventures with local soft drinks
bottlers.
The Bulgarian Coca-Cola bottling operation, launched at the end of last
year, posted first-half profits of Dr260m on sales of Dr3.15bn. HBC's
earnings from Bulgaria amounted to Dr120m, the company said.
The company forecasts strong second-half growth in turnover in Bulgaria
following the launch there of other soft drinks brands over the summer,
together with the introduction of plastic bottles for Coca-Cola.
HBC's recent acquisition of Pet, a Greek manufacturer of plastic packaging,
which controls two local fruit-juice producers, will also help the company
position itself for further expansion in Balkan markets.
HBC also holds a 15 per cent stake in two joint ventures for bottling
Coca-Cola in Romania. They were set up last year as part of an Dollars 18m
investment by HBC's parent company, the Cyprus-based Leventis Group.
Production started over the summer at two new plants in northern Romania,
covering almost 30 per cent of the market. Leventis shares the Romanian
Coca-Cola franchise with the Atlanta-based parent company and a
Turkish-owned bottling group.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European herb and spice businesses of two US food processing companies
and a German herb and spice concern are being combined to create a venture
with sales of around Dollars 200m a year. Rabobank, the Dutch bank, will
finance the venture, known as European Spice Partners, and take a 25 per
cent stake.
The deal brings together the European herb and spice operations of
McCormick, a Maryland-based specialist in spices and seasonings, and the
larger CPC International, a corn refiner and maker of grocery products based
in New Jersey whose products include Knorr soups, Hellmann's mayonnaise and
Mazola corn oil.
Each will own 37.5 per cent of the new joint venture, with the remaining
shares held by Rabobank. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The new company would account for around 15 per cent of the Dollars 1.4bn
European market for retail and catering herbs, the companies said.
The two US companies' other European operations, including those in
'industrial' herbs and spices (those sold to food processors or to fast-food
companies), will remain separate, although both companies said further
co-operation in Europe may follow.
CPC, which last year generated Dollars 2.6bn of its Dollars 6.6bn sales in
Europe, said: 'We are bringing the infrastructure and the experience of
operating in Europe; McCormick is bringing its experience in the herb and
spice business.'
The new venture will be based around McCormick's retail and catering herb
and spice operations in the UK, Switzerland and Germany. The company also
has licensing operations in Finland and Spain.
CPC will contribute its own herb and spice business in Germany and Ireland
and an unspecified amount of cash.
The transaction is subject to approval from the European Commission.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Baxter shares tumble by 15%
after earnings alert
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Baxter International tumbled nearly 15 per cent yesterday
following a third-quarter profits warning by the US hospital supplier.
Baxter, which achieved notoriety earlier this year by pleading guilty to
co-operating with the Arab boycott against Israel, said its third-quarter
earnings would fall below last year's Dollars 148m, or 53 cents a share.
Analysts had predicted earnings of more than 57 cents.
Following the warning, analysts at Cowen &amp; Company reduced 1993 earnings
projections by 15 cents, to Dollars 2.05 a share, and cut 20 cents off 1994
predictions, to Dollars 2.20. Analysts at Cowen expect further cost-cutting
moves will dampen Baxter's near-term earnings.
The company also plans to cut senior management salaries by as much as 25
per cent, and to freeze other employee salaries.
On Wall Street, Baxter's shares dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 22 7/8 ,
just above their 52-week low of Dollars 22 1/4 , in active trading. The news
sent shock waves through the medical sector, with Oxford Health Plans down
Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 and PacifiCare Health Systems plunging
Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 34.
Baxter blamed weak market conditions for its second consecutive earnings
shortfall; in July, the company warned that second-quarter operating income
would decline. Mr Vernon Loucks, chief executive, said revenue growth had
slowed throughout the industry, reflecting changes in health care spending
in anticipation of health care reform.
'Baxter did show revenue growth of 6.5 per cent for the second quarter of
1993,' he said. However, Baxter's problems run deeper than the industry's
woes. The company has lost business from private hospitals and the US
government in the aftermath of the Arab boycott debacle.
Last month, the Department of Veterans Affairs banned Baxter from bidding on
new contracts for up to one year.
Although sales to US government agencies brought in only about Dollars 130m
of the company's Dollars 8.5bn 1992 sales, and waivers have since been
granted on about half of Baxter's VA business, the ban further damaged
Baxter's credibility.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: NTT warns on effects of
telephone charges war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NTT, the Japanese tele-communications company, yesterday warned that pre-tax
profits for the year to next March would plunge 67 per cent to Y50bn
(Dollars 480.7m) if it went ahead with a planned reduction in long-distance
rates. The group previously forecast profits of Y150bn for the period.
Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, made the warning for the parent
company. He cautioned that it might even be forced to post a pre-tax loss if
it did not raise rates for city calls.
He added, however, that the company planned to maintain its dividend by
carrying over about Y86bn in profits from fiscal 1992. NTT shares yesterday
suffered a fall of Y11,000 to Y930,000.
NTT yesterday applied to the ministry of posts and telecommunications to
lower its rates for long-distance calls. The move was an attempt by the
company, which was privatised in 1986, to compete more efficiently with its
rivals, which have taken about 30 per cent of the long-distance market.
NTT's competitors, however, responded by threatening cuts of their own.
The planned rate cuts by NTT, which average 21.4 per cent and are to be
implemented in October, would trim revenue by Y270m on an annual basis,
according to Mr Kojima.
At the same time, NTT hopes to increase rates on short-distance city calls,
basic charges, and directory services. All these areas have posted losses.
Kleinwort Benson estimates that a rise in NTT's local call rates could
double the company's profits by 1994.
However, the ministry of posts and telecommunications is unlikely to approve
NTT rate rises without strong evidence that the company is cutting costs
substantially or indications that its profitability has deteriorated
dramatically.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kraft, Jacobs Suchard to link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food company, is to merge Kraft General
Foods Europe and Jacobs Suchard, its two main European food businesses. The
link-up creates a group with sales this year of about Dollars 9bn in 20
countries.
The group, to be called Kraft Jacobs Suchard (KJS), will be Europe's third
largest food manufacturer after Nestle and Unilever, and will have
particularly strong positions in coffee, confectionery and cheese.
Integration of the two businesses, which will be phased over the rest of the
year, is designed to improve productivity, cut costs, streamline management,
and unify marketing in the face of increasingly tough competition in Europe,
company executives said.
Mr Raymond Viault has been named president and chief executive of KJS. He
previously headed Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery and coffee company
which Philip Morris acquired three years ago for Dollars 3.8bn.
Jacobs Suchard has until now operated almost separately from Kraft General
Foods Europe, which was formed out of Philip Morris' acquisitions of Kraft
and General Foods of the US in the 1980s.
The two businesses' headquarters will be merged in one office in Zurich,
Switzerland, and their operations in most countries combined under one
management. Mr Viault said the reorganisation would create 'some
redundancies' among the group's 32,000 staff in 20 countries.
He said the merger, which has been under discussion for five months, was
expected to achieve some 'fairly significant savings', particularly in
purchasing, distribution and warehousing.

loans

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOTA BANK, the Swedish state-owned bank, is to spin off SKr43bn (Dollars
5.4bn) worth of problem loans into a separate bank to facilitate the
disposal of its healthy activities before the year-end.
All problem credits valued at more than SKr5m will be transferred to the
unit, Retriva AB, by the end of the year.
Although Retriva will initially be a wholly-owned company, it is almost
certain to follow Securum, the bad loan bank for Nordbanken, in being split
off and taken over by the state.
The Swedish bank support authority, which is overseeing the reconstruction
of Gota Bank, said yesterday it had decided to siphon off the problem loans
to get a better price for the bank's healthy assets, valued at SKr60bn.
It also stressed that Gota's problem loans could be wound down more
effectively if they were part of a separate unit. Details of how Retriva is
to be financed during the liquidation phase were not revealed.
Around 65 per cent of Retriva's problem loans are linked to real estate. It
will be managing 1,200 properties, around half of which it expects to
purchase over the next few years. The long-term aim is to dispose of all the
properties, but gradually so as not to depress market prices.
The state has provided SKr15bn in guarantees to help Gota Bank meet minimum
capital adequacy requirements during a period of heavy credit losses.
Final bids for the bank's healthy activities, which made a SKr836m operating
profit in the first six months, have to be received by September 23.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGING weather patterns in Europe were partly to blame for a 4.8 per cent
decline in first-half results at Grolsch, the Dutch brewer which has
recently made inroads to Britain and Germany.
Net profit fell to Fl 14.2m (Dollars 7.7m) from Fl 14.9m in the first half
of 1992, when a long spell of good weather in north-western Europe generated
strong beer sales. This year, the weather had been 'no better than average'.
The company blamed this in part for a 7.6 per cent decline in turnover, to
Fl 391.8m.
It also blamed the lower results on weak economies, especially in Germany,
and on the decline of sterling, which depressed turnover from the company's
Ruddles subsidiary and from its sales of Dutch-brewed beer destined for the
UK market.
Despite these difficult conditions, operating profit rose to Fl 24.5m from
Fl 22.4m, reflecting rises in selling prices as well as declines in the
prices of raw materials, marketing expenses and excise duties.
However, financial income swung into a negative Fl 3.3m from a positive Fl
28,000 the year before, due to the 1992 cash acquisition of Ruddles and a
heavy programme of investments requiring external financing.

GROUP losses at Klockner-Humbolt-Deutz, the German engineering group, more
than trebled in the first six months of the current year. It said the impact
of the recession in Germany had turned out to be worse than expected.
Despite the loss of DM98m (Dollars 61.25m) - up from a DM29m loss in the
first half of last year - KHD said it expected to break even for the year as
a whole. It said extensive rationalisation measures had led to a permanent
lowering of the group's break-even point.
The group will take some DM300m of restructuring costs 'below the line' as
extraordinary expenditure, reflecting the cost of shedding 2,500 jobs during
the year.
Sales for the first six months dropped 21 per cent to DM1.28bn, and order
intake fell 23 per cent to DM1.66bn. The drop in domestic demand for
machinery was behind these falls, the group said.
The year-on-year fall in orders concealed the fact that the order book
itself was 16 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year.
KHD saw no short-term prospect of recovery in the European markets for its
motors, and agricultural products such as tractors.

TOTAL, the French oil group, yesterday announced a modest decline in net
profits, to FFr1.8bn (Dollars 317.5m) from FFr1.9bn for the first half of
1993. The result underlines its resilience to recession in Europe.
Turnover dipped from FFr68.76bn to FFr67.85bn, in what the company described
as a difficult economic environment. Operating income profits, however, rose
slightly from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.49bn.
'It was a good result given the economic background,' said Mr John
Wellemeyer, oil industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. He forecast net profits
of about FFr3.6bn for the full year.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman of Total, said the results reflected a varied
performance across the group's core businesses, and that the benefits of its
'refocusing' strategy, launched in 1990, would start to be felt from next
year.
He said the group had begun to seek alliances in gas distribution and
electricity supply, and that this presented strong growth opportunities.
In the first six months, the exploration and production division was hit by
the decline in crude oil prices, from Dollars 19 per barrel to about Dollars
18.20. As a result, operating income fell to FFr1.19bn from FFr1.31bn in the
first half of 1992.
Oil production, excluding the Middle East, fell from 154,000 to 135,000
barrels per day. Gas production also fell, from 972m to 941m cu ft. per day.
Total said the reductions reflected the impact of disposals. New
developments in the second half would offset these declines.
Its 1992 forecast for production growth of 50 per cent between 1990 and 1995
remained unaffected, the group said.
The chemicals division, affected by the European recession and the downturn
in the automotive and construction industries, also saw profits decline.
Operating profits fell to FFr753m from FFr852m.
The trading and Middle East division increased operating profits from
FFr304m to FFr434m, reflecting an improvement in shipping rates in the first
six months of the year.
Mr Tchuruk also raised the prospect of a further sale of the French state's
holding in the oil group. Although the government has said it wants to
maintain its stake in Total at about 5 per cent, the effects of capital
increases during the year have raised this to 8 per cent.
The sale of the surplus 3 per cent, which is valued at about FFr2bn, could
be made at any time, he said.

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pricing pressure hurts CMB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARNAUDMETALBOX (CMB), the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday announced
a 7 per cent fall in first-half net profits. It warned of a similar decline
during the second six months.
The shares closed down FFr10.5 at FFr198.5.
The company reported net profits of FFr509m (Dollars 89.8m) for the first
half of 1993, compared with FFr549m in the same period last year.
Sales declined 6 per cent to FFr11.89bn.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman, said operating profits in the first half were
'hit hard by severe pricing pressure in European beverage cans and some
exceptional events in Asia and Africa'.
These included problems at its Singapore plant concerning the conversion
from steel to aluminium drinks cans, and disruptions to supplies in Africa,
particularly in Nigeria where the group's operations suffered from fuel
shortages.
The group chairman said: 'We are not expecting a net profit improvement for
the rest of this year because recessionary pressures in Europe have been
worse than expected in recent months and are not likely to ease soon.'
In response to the difficult markets, the company said it was planning to
cut production capacity, and would close a plant in Germany this year. Mr
Hintz said the group intended to raise prices next year in an attempt to
restore falling margins.
Despite the fall in profits and the difficult outlook, Mr Hintz described
the figures as a 'solid net result'.
The company said the downturn during the period had been exaggerated by the
impact of currency movements.
Excluding currency factors, net profits would have risen by 3 per cent,
rather than declining 7 per cent.
The fall in operating profits, from FFr1.23bn to FFr974m, would also have
been much smaller.

acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBRIGHTON plans an acquisition and to raise Pounds 3.4m net through a
rights issue at 17p per share. Yesterday the shares closed 1p lower at 20p.
The company is paying Pounds 2.9m cash to acquire the assets of the
dimensional stone business currently carried on by RMC, comprising three
operational quarries, three dormant ones, and three processing plants.
In addition, a lease agreement has been entered into over a 5.2 acre site in
Redditch with an option to purchase at Pounds 1.3m.
Currently the group has eight sandstone quarries, two granite quarries and
five processing plants.
The rights comprises 21.7m shares to be offered on a 3-for-7 basis. Tarmac,
which acquired 8.4m shares in Albrighton in January, is having them
conditionally placed with institutions at 17p each.
It will then have no interest in the capital.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Nurdin &amp; Peacock ahead at Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NURDIN &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry operator, said yesterday the second of
its US-style cut price warehouses would open as planned next summer in spite
of 'petulant' attempts to 'stifle' the project by a national retailer.
The company faces a judicial review of planning permission, sparked by
Sainsbury, which could push up costs at its second site, which is in the
West Midlands.
Mr Nigel Hall, finance director, said: 'We think this is a petulant attempt
to stifle a project which is clearly in the consumer interest.'
Announcing half-year underlying pre-tax profits up 4 per cent on sales down
by a similar amount and volumes off 9 per cent, Mr Dickie Fulford, chairman,
said the first warehouse was on schedule: 'The Cargo Club warehouse at
Croydon is under construction and will open in March 1994.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.59m to Pounds 7.07m in the six months to
July 2, flattered by one-off costs of Pounds 1.3m in the comparative figure.
Turnover fell to Pounds 677.9m (Pounds 704.1m). Better control of costs and
stock levels helped operating profit margins rise to 0.9 per cent (0.7 per
cent).
Mr Fulford said: 'The results reflect the continuing severity of the
economic environment and the competition for the business of independent
grocers and caterers. This has been offset by further improvements in
operating efficiency.'
The Glasgow trade and business centre, launched in 1992, continued to
perform up to expectations. The company is extending its buying procedures
and selecting merchandise ahead of the opening of the Croydon development.
The company believed it had gained market share 'from all the other
operators' in its core and carry business of 46 outlets mainly in the
south-east. It also believed that the independent grocery sector had
declined by about 10 per cent over the last 12 months as consumer spending
switched to supermarkets and some rivals were forced out of business.
It received Pounds 555,000 (Pounds 1.09m) in interest as rates fell.
Earnings per share rose to 3.86p (3.08p) and the interim dividend is being
increased to 2.06p (1.96p).

Pre-tax profits at Porvair, the maker of microporous synthetic materials,
advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 849,000 in the six months to May 31.
The rise was due to organic growth at its original companies.
The directors pointed out that acquisitions impacted more on turnover which
rose 31 per cent to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.86m).
Earnings per share came out at 4.5p (4p) and the interim dividend is being
raised to 1.4p (1.2p).
Mr John Morgan, chairman, said he expected the year as a whole to be one of
further progress.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: First Henderson trust since TR merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Touche Remnant is launching its first investment trust since the
merger of the two fund management groups late last year.
The new trust, which will invest in Japanese smaller companies, is aiming to
raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m via a placing and offer for
subscription of shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
Henderson TR believes that low interest rates and increased government
spending will help the Japanese economy to grow appreciably in 1994 and
1995. Low rates will also push investors away from cash and into the stock
markets where, although p/e ratios are very high, Henderson TR thinks stocks
look attractive on a price-to-cash flow basis.
The annual management charge will be 1 per cent of assets, and issue
expenses will be capped at 4 per cent. The trust will have an initial life
of 10 years. Closing day for applications will be October 14 and dealings
are expected to start on October 22.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tullow Oil back in the black at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in oil and gas sales helped Tullow Oil, the Irish exploration
and development company, to turn in an operating profit of IPounds 271,958
(Pounds 254,000) for the first half of 1993, against a Pounds 10,343 loss
last time.
Sales grew by over 72 per cent to IPounds 938,479, but the directors
explained that that included only one month's contribution from the Senegal
well.
And the sales were affected by disruption to UK production caused by testing
programmes.
Sales in the second half were expected to include full contributions from
production in both Senegal and the UK as well as first production from the
Czech licence, the, directors stated.
At the attributable level, profit came out at IPounds 290,159, against
IPounds 2.16m last time which included IPounds 2.19m profit on the sale of a
licence interest.
Earnings per share at six months fell from 1.48p to 0.2p.

ON TURNOVER up by 47 per cent from Pounds 9.22m to Pounds 13.6m, Eadie
Holdings, the general engineering group, pushed pre-tax profits ahead to
Pounds 850,000 for the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 85,000 last
time.
Mr Peter Bromwich, chairman, said profits were in line with expectations,
with good contributions from all areas of the business.
He explained that half the turnover boost came from acquisitions, with the
rest from organic growth.
After tax of Pounds 280,000 (Pounds 20,000) earnings per share were 1.09p,
against 0.19p, and the company is returning to the interim dividend list
with 0.3p - last year there was a single final payment of 0.5p.
Mr Bromwich stated that Eadie continued to seek opportunities 'for the
careful expansion of the group by further acquisitions, by the introduction
of new products into existing businesses and by continued expansion of the
customer base.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: 'Patchy' markets leave Ocean static at
Pounds 20.8m - Particularly bad conditions in continental Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services combine which
underwent an Pounds 8m streamlining of its management structure last year,
has announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.8m for the first half
of 1993.
That followed a 20 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 789.1m (Pounds
653.4m).
Earnings per share and the interim dividend were also unchanged at 9.4p and
4.71p respectively.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the results were consistent with
the group's plans. He described its markets as 'patchy,' with particularly
bad conditions in continental Europe. The group was not expecting any help
from the world economy this year.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.6m) and included Pounds
700,000 from Panocean, whose overseas activities were sold to Royal Pakhoed
in March for Pounds 55m including debt. Panocean also contributed Pounds
6.4m to turnover.
Net interest payments were Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.8m), reflecting a Pounds
12m increase in net debt to Pounds 63m and the reduction in UK interest
returns from the group's Pounds 33m worth of sterling deposits. However,
gearing was down from 35 per cent at December 31 to just over 20 per cent
following the Panocean disposal.
Pre-tax profit included a Pounds 2m benefit from exchange gains, countered
by increased costs on the computer system being installed at MSAS, the
international freight business.
Freight and distribution services, which operate on very fine margins,
boosted turnover by just over 25 per cent to Pounds 682.7m for the half,
although its operating profit eased from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.8m. The group
expected to see the benefits from its new computer system next year.
Marine services contributed the bulk of the profits, with Pounds 14.8m
(Pounds 12.6m) from a turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 63.8m. Mr Barber said
the group had moved its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed
North Sea to areas of strength in West Africa and south-east Asia.
Cory Towage had a good first half and benefited from favourable trading in a
number of its markets and from salvage revenue. Results at OIL showed an
improvement over last year.
Operating profit from the environmental services division was Pounds 1.8m
(Pounds 1.6m) on turnover of Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 32.8m).
COMMENT
Rarely can a flatter first half have been announced. The company says it is
satisfied with its progress since last year's reorganisation, which shed
nearly 500 jobs and is expected to reap a full benefit of Pounds 5m by the
year end after Pounds 1.5m in the first half. These savings are likely to
account for the rise in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 44m, from Pounds
38.1m last year. But the picture is not so rosy if currency gains of Pounds
4m to Pounds 5m are added into the equation. However, the outlook brightens
next year, when the benefits of the freight distribution business's new
computer system should start to feed through and the Pounds 18m Barcelona
distribution centre announced in July comes on stream. Meanwhile the shares
are worth holding for their 5 1/2 per cent yield.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Equipment failure hits Cluff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE of equipment, which interrupted production at Freda Rebecca,
Zimbabwe's biggest gold mine, for seven weeks contributed to a 28 per cent
drop in midway pre-tax profits reported by Cluff Resources, the UK-based
gold company.
Very high interest rates in Zimbabwe also affected the result and pre-tax
profits dropped from Pounds 915,000 to Pounds 661,000 for the period to June
30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 6.97m to Pounds 6.67m and gold output was down
from 35,625 troy ounces in the first half of 1992, when production was held
back by power cuts associated with Zimbabwe's drought, to 28,166 ounces.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said both mills at Freda Rebecca were back in full
production following repairs to a motor which drives one of them and that
the company's gold output this year was expected to reach 65,000 ounces
against a previous target of 70,000.
Cluff's interest payments would ease considerably once it completed a large
gold loan being negotiated in Zimbabwe - the first ever permitted by that
country's central bank. The loan should be completed later this month.
Some of the proceeds, about USDollars 12m (Pounds 7.9m) would fund
underground development at Freda Rebecca, taking annual capacity to nearly
100,000 ounces during 1995.
Aberfoyle, the Zimbabwean industrial and farming group in which Cluff
recently acquired a 70 per cent stake, would make a positive contribution to
results, said Mr Cluff.
Cluff's net earnings in the half year were Pounds 278,000 (Pounds 238,000),
equal to 38p (33p) per share.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Portals at Pounds 14m and mills working at
full capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS GROUP, the special-ist paper and environmental protection and
control products group, yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits and said a strong inflow of orders meant that its mills were
working at full capacity.
Pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 13.5m in the six months to
June 30, on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 91.2m (Pounds
83.9m).
Discontinued operations added another Pounds 7.23m to turnover in the
comparable period.
Earnings per share, fully diluted, increased by 9 per cent to 14.89p
(13.68p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5.25p (5p).
Mr John Lloyd, managing director, said Portals was pleased to have increased
sales and profits in what remained a challenging commercial environment.
Within papermaking he said orders were strong, but noted that 'there is a
production challenge to meet this demand'.
The benefits of last autumn's devaluation had been used to improve
competitiveness and boost volumes, rather than margins, which already stand
at about 20 per cent.
As a result there had been strong order inflows at all three papermaking
companies. In particular Portals (Bathford) won three new overseas contracts
and was recently awarded the DSS contract to produce high security covers
for pension and other allowance books, and JR Crompton, the round tea-bag
maker, had had 'an excellent first half'.
The security and specialist papermaking operations raised operating profits
by 4 per cent to Pounds 9.9m on sales up by 10 per cent to Pounds 51.6m.
Results from the protection and control division were more mixed. The
division lifted operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.6m on sales of
Pounds 39.6m, an increase of 7 per cent.
Margins were higher than in the first half of 1992, but below the
exceptionally high levels of the second half, while orders were maintained.
The two core businesses within the division, Houseman and Computer
Technology, performed well, but elsewhere the effects were felt of the
increasingly difficult market in continental Europe.
The downturn in the French car market hit Ermeto's diesel tube business,
while Vacuumatic suffered from the impact of the German recession.
Portals ended June with net cash of Pounds 7.1m, an improvement of Pounds
9.9m in the period, although net cash fell to Pounds 1m on July 1 after
payment of the 1992 final dividend.
The improvement in the cash position came after relatively low capital
expenditure of Pounds 4.3m, the Pounds 1.8m acquisition of Sonoco Packaging
Tapes, which manufactures the security threads found in banknotes, and a
Pounds 1.6m increase in working capital, which were offset by the disposal
of Airoil-Flaregas for Pounds 3.9m.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reaching out for the sky screens / A look
behind the figures in the improving results from BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK when Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation was in London
we had the glitz, the live boa constrictors, all the new subscription
television channels and the headline claim that British Sky Broadcasting was
in profit.
Yesterday with Mr Murdoch back in Los Angeles, BSkyB, the parent company for
Sky Television, released its financial results for the year to June 1993 in
a much quieter vein and a raft of numbers and predictions about how the
satellite market in the UK was moving.
BSkyB announced an operational profit of Pounds 61.5m, a turnround of Pounds
108m on the year. Mr Murdoch's News Corporation holds a 50 per cent stake in
the satellite venture and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, holds 17.5
per cent.
Turnover rose 63 per cent to Pounds 380m, 80 per cent of it coming from
subscriptions to movie channels and the Sky Sports channel.
The financial structure of BSkyB is complex, bordering on the byzantine. The
operating figure is considered the most realistic basis for judging what is
emerging from its start-up phase, however there was still a large pre-tax
loss last year because of the interest charged on money invested by the
founding shareholders.
Last year's interest on external debt of Pounds 100m was Pounds 8m but there
was also a notional interest figure of Pounds 130m on shareholder debt of
Pounds 1.2bn out of the total of Pounds 1.7bn invested in BSkyB so far.
Shareholder interest is accruing. The loans are convertible and could become
equity to produce dramatic pre-tax profits if the shareholders decided this
was more favourable than the present tax advantages.
BSkyB was cash positive throughout the year, did not draw down Pounds 34m of
available funding and will start distributing cash back to its shareholders
from January. Apart from News Corporation and Pearson, the main shareholders
are Chargeurs of France and the Granada group.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs said after the
presentation: 'I think it looks pretty good for the future. I think this is
a very encouraging performance.'
More important than how the shareholders treat interest payments is what is
happening to subscription revenue, the future heart of the business now that
BSkyB is almost exclusively a subscription service.
Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, said that the company was
now the leading satellite television company in the world after attracting
700,000 new paying subscribers in the year to the end of June.
He was speaking on the day that Sky Sports was showing exclusive coverage of
the England versus Poland World Cup qualifying game.
Going beyond the financial year Mr Davey said that 100,000 new movie
subscribers were signed up in August and that the total number of
subscribers paying for at least one of the premium movie services had now
passed 2m.
BSkyB's internal research presented yesterday showed dish sales rising week
on week from 11,000 a week in the first week of July to 22,000 a week in the
last week of August.
The claimed rise is at least partly reflected in the latest estimates of the
size of the UK satellite market by BARB, the official broadcasting ratings
organisation owned by the BBC and ITV. BARB said that there were 2.5m
dishes, not including cable, at the beginning of August and 2.57m dishes in
place by the beginning of this month.
BSkyB also used BARB statistics to show that although 15.1 per cent of homes
in the UK had satellites the figure for men aged 16-34 was 26.3 per cent and
24 per cent for children.
Mr Davey also quoted TGI, an independent researcher, to back his claim that
the Sky audience was not disproportionately down-market.
The proportion of Sky homes with income below Pounds 9,999 a year was less
than both the national average and that of ITV and Channel 4 viewers. Sky
homes, the company said, with incomes between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds
24,999 and above Pounds 25,000 were all above the national average and ITV
and Channel 4.
After hearing the presentation Mr Blackley said there was a growing danger
that BSkyB 'could become so dominant in the pay television market that
cross-media ownership will become a serious political issue'.
Yesterday BSkyB also confirmed that it would launch pay-per-view television
 -charging for individual events - sometime next year, although it said a
starting date had not yet been decided.
'We have the technology and we have the ambition,' Mr Davey said. A second
Sky Sports channel will start in time for the English cricket team's winter
tour of the West Indies and work continues on the possibility of launching a
Sky arts channel sometime next year.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Royal sells US reinsurance arm for Dollars
59m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday announced the sale of its
US reinsurance arm, American Royal, to the Australian group, QBE Insurance
Group, for Dollars 59m (Pounds 39m).
The sale represents 'a significant diminution of our reinsurance exposure
which has been identified as non-core business longer term,' said Mr Richard
Gamble, chief executive. Royal took the decision to withdraw from
reinsurance earlier this year.
At the end of 1992 American Royal had net written premiums of Dollars 41m
and statutory net assets of Dollars 54m. Royal bought the group for Pounds
15m in 1983, when it was seeking to diversify the base of its reinsurance
business outside Europe. The group made profits until 1992, when it
sustained losses as a result of heavy losses from Hurricane Andrew.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Proposed ruling will hit Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE restructured Rothmans tobacco group will be excluded from the FT-SE 100
index if a proposed rule change goes ahead, and nearly half SmithKline
Beecham's market capitalisation may also be omitted.
The proposed rule change, announced yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries UK
Indices Committee, means that only companies which pay a mandatory UK
franked dividend will be eligible for inclusion in the indices.
The committee proposed the change in response to the problem set by the
restructuring of Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings. Rothmans is a
current constituent of the Footsie; Dunhill is a subsidiary of Rothmans and
is accordingly excluded from the indices.
Four new companies will be formed: Rothmans plc and Rothmans International
NV; and Vendome plc and Vendome SA. Although the two pairs will be linked in
the form of inseparable units, shareholders will be able to elect whether to
receive the dividend from either the PLC or the NV company. If they choose
the latter, the dividend will not be franked (ie, will be paid gross).
It is a principle of the indices that only UK companies are included, but at
Rothmans/Vendome, the ability of shareholders to elect for dividends makes
it impossible to give a precise definition of the proportion of the company
which counts as UK-based.
The committee, which consists of market participants and is chaired by Mr
Peter Jones of fund managers M&amp;G, has proposed a rule which says that
companies where shareholders may choose between a franked or an unfranked
dividend would not be eligible.
This rule would exclude Rothmans/Vendome from the indices. It would also
cause a problem for SmithKline Beecham units which have been included in the
indices for several years, and make up nearly half the capitalisation of the
company. The rules, as drafted, would exclude the units, which comprise
about 1 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index. Discussions are taking place with
the company and its advisers.
Mr Mark Makepeace, head of indices at the Stock Exchange said: 'The problem
is that it is very difficult to look through the structure of
Rothmans/Vendome and say how much of it is a UK company. The index is
designed to serve investors who are seeking to gain exposure to UK
companies, and not those from overseas.'
Mr Ken Costa, of Warburg Securities, joint brokers to Rothmans/Vendome,
said: 'We're trying to understand the basis for the decision before making
any further comment.'
The rule needs to be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries share Indices Steering
committee which meets on October 6.
The composition of the indices is very important to investment managers who
aim either to track them, or outperform them.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Scotia looks for Pounds 30m from listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTIA Holdings, a pharm-aceutical company built on sales of evening
primrose oil, will be floated on the London stock market next month with an
expected capitalisation of about Pounds 160m.
The Scotia board yesterday approved final arrangements for the flotation,
which is co-ordinated by Kleinwort Benson. According to the pathfinder
prospectus, issued today, the company aims to raise about Pounds 30m based
on a share price between 260p and 290p.
Dr David Horrobin, chief executive, said most of the proceeds would be used
to fund the final development of six drugs now undergoing clinical trials.
They included treatments for cancer, arthritis, heart disease and
complications of diabetes.
Dr Horrobin, whose background is in academic medicine, has followed a clear
strategy ever since he founded the company - then known as Efamol - in 1979.
He quickly established a revenue stream by selling nutritional supplements
made of seed oil from the evening primrose plant; sales were promoted by
clinical studies showing the oil's health benefits over a wide range of
problems from alcoholism to arthritis.
This income financed research and development of prescription drugs based
mainly on 'essential fatty acids', the beneficial chemicals in evening
primrose oil.
Scotia's first drug, Epogam, received a UK license in 1988 for treating the
skin disorder eczema. The company has since received approval for Efamast
(for breast pain) and Efalith (for seborrhoeic dermatitis, another skin
disease).
The company has distribution agreements with international pharmaceutical
groups - notably Searle, a subsidiary of Monsanto, in the UK. Total sales of
Scotia's pharmaceutical products in the year to June 30 1993 exceeded Pounds
20m, of which the company received Pounds 7.4m. Over-the-counter sales were
worth a further Pounds 6.5m.
Scotia had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.1m in 1991-92 mainly as a
result of an up-front distribution payment by Searle. In the following year
there was a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 4.4m and Dr Horrobin expected losses
of Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m a year over the next two or three years - a period
of heavy R&amp;D spending.
The three most advanced projects are: EF4 to treat the nerve damage
resulting from diabetes; EF13 to treat cancer; and EF27 to reduce the
side-effects of radiotherapy. If clinical trials go well, they should be
launched in 1996 or 1997.
Scotia is an unusual pharmaceutical company. It concentrates on a field  -
essential fatty acids derived from natural products - that has been
virtually ignored by the rest of the industry. And, instead of centralised
R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities, it has small units scattered around the
UK, from Surrey to the Outer Hebrides, and a basic research centre in Nova
Scotia, Canada.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber gives details of Pounds 3m
refinancing plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Phoenix Timber fell 1 1/2 p to 12 1/2 p after announcing further
details of its refinancing under which it is raising Pounds 2.94m to cut
borrowings.
The Co-operation Retirement Benefit Fund has already subscribed Pounds 1.44m
in Pounds 1 loans at par. These are now being offered to existing
shareholders on the basis of Pounds 1 nominal for 10 shares held at a price
of 111p each.
Some Pounds 1.5m is being raised by a rights issue of 5-for-8 and 125 for
Pounds 16 nominal loan notes at 8p per share. The issue is underwritten by
CRBF.
At the same time the 25p shares are being split into 5p ordinary and 20p
deferred which are considered valueless.
As a result of the moves CRBF may end up with more than 30 per cent but the
Takeover Panel has waived the need to make a full offer. Mr John Bushell, Mr
Charles Benham and Mr Robert Ainsworth are leaving the board. Mr Duncan
Saville, who is a director of CRBF, and Mr Lars Ahrell are to become
directors.
CRBF said that it considered its investment to be long term and it intends
to maintain the listing.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals lift Singer &amp; Friedlander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank and property
group, rose from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 11.7m in the six months to June 30,
but were considerably affected by exceptionals.
The latest figure benefited from an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.6m on the
sale of an investment, while last's figure was depressed by an exceptional
write-down of Pounds 5.3m in the value of investment properties.
Profits from merchant banking and investment management rose by 19 per cent
to Pounds 5.7m. The group said all divisions of its core business had
improved significantly.
Property profits increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 1.9m because of lower
interest rates and increased rents.
An internal valuation of the portfolio showed no significant change since
December.
Interest and investment income fell from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 1.47m as a
result of spending Pounds 45m on loan stock redemption and a share buy-in.
The interim dividend rose to 1.25p (1p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VARDON, the leisure company which owns Sea Life Centres and The London
Dungeon and came to the market in October 1992, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 540,000 in the six months to June 30, against restated losses of
Pounds 282,000.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.25p to 0.3p.
Turnover at the visitor attractions division grew to Pounds 5.44m (Pounds
3.15m), giving operating profits of Pounds 539,000 (Pounds 302,000). Three
new attractions were added during the period - the Seal Sanctuary in
Cornwall was bought in February and Sea Life Centres in Southend, Essex, and
Scheveningen, the Netherlands, were opened in May. The London Dungeon was
refurbished and now includes the Jack the Ripper Experience. Capital
expenditure totalled Pounds 3.9m in the period.
The group's 10 bingo clubs, acquired in May, traded for seven weeks within
the group and contributed turnover of Pounds 1.02m and operating profits of
Pounds 99,000.
Group turnover was Pounds 6.45m (Pounds 3.75m). Earnings worked through at
0.7p (losses 0.9p).

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall rises to Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall Group, the banking and investment management group, raised
pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.61m in the first half of 1993.
The current year's figure included Pounds 493,000 from the sale of Jupiter's
interest in Tyndall Australia, but with a number of non-recurring items also
in the comparable figures, Mr John Duffield, chairman, said the increase was
regarded as a 'fair reflection' of the group's underlying performance.
Earnings per share were 8.2p (7p), while an interim cash dividend of 4p (3p)
has been declared or an enhanced scrip dividend to the value of 6p per
share.
James Capel will be underwriting the scrip dividend shares, the directors
stated, at a discount of 2.5 per cent, free of expenses to a selling
shareholder.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Airtours changes broker and public

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the travel group, has changed its broker and public relations
adviser, dropping the firms that advised it during its failed bid for Owners
Abroad earlier this year. It is also expected to appoint a second merchant
bank.
The group announced yesterday that Hoare Govett would become its
stockbroker, replacing Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Brunswick is replacing College Hill as public relations adviser.
It is believed that the group intends to appoint Morgan Grenfell as its
merchant banker. It is thought that Morgan Grenfell will work alongside
British Linen Bank, the group's current merchant banker.
Mr Eric Sanderson, British Linen Bank's chief executive, is a non-executive
director of Airtours.
Airtours said last night that it felt the need for change and for new ideas.
The changes in advisers implied 'no specific criticism' of those dropped by
the company.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sema shows 38% improvement to Pounds 10.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported
a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits excluding profits on
disposals.
Pre-tax profits before the profit on disposals increased from Pounds 7.73 to
Pounds 10.6m in the six months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 19 per
cent to Pounds 232.9m (Pounds 195.4m).
However, profits were further boosted by a Pounds 4.63m profit on disposals
in the latest period and Pounds 20.8m profits on the disposal of
discontinued operations in the year-ago period.
As a result pre-tax profits under the new FRS 3 accounting rules fell to
Pounds 15.2m from Pounds 28.5m and earnings per share dropped from 22.27p to
10.26p.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 21.6 per cent to
Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 8m).
The company said that the strategy of focusing on systems integration and
facilities management while maintaining a leadership position in key market
sectors such as banking, energy, defence 'has proved to be correct.'
In addition, the group had entered the second half with a strong order book
and looked forward to achieving continued progress in its core businesses.
During the first half Sema spent Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 6.3m) on research and
development and its book-to-bill ratio improved to 1.14 compared with 1.06 a
year earlier.
The advance in turnover was led by the group's UK operations which lifted
sales by 21.4 per cent to Pounds 103.9m.
The group's German, Spanish and Benelux operations all showed declines in
turnover at constant exchange rates.
The balance sheet was strengthened during the period and the group ended
June with net cash of Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 12.3m).
The group recorded net interest receipts of Pounds 847,000 compared with net
interest payments of Pounds 273,000 in the 1992 period.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes advances to Pounds 3.27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLES Baynes, which yesterday announced a rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 3.27m for the first half of 1993, is to expand its
distribution side with the acquisition of Buck &amp; Hickman from P&amp;O for a
maximum of Pounds 32.48m cash.
'We love distribution businesses,' said Mr John Perkins, finance director,
adding that any company would like to acquire well and independently run,
cash-generative businesses from larger groups returning to their cores.
B&amp;H, a distributor of engineers' tools, consumables and equipment in the UK,
will keep its present management and will operate on a stand-alone basis
within Baynes.
The purchase will be funded by the issue of some 34.5m 5.8p (net)
mandatorily convertible preference shares at 100p each to raise about Pounds
33.3m net. They are convertible at 69p per share and will be available in an
open offer to ordinary shareholders on a 1-for-4 basis. SG Warburg will
subscribe for any shares not taken up in the offer.
Mr Perkins said that with an acquisition of this size, Baynes wanted the net
profits of B&amp;H to service the preference shares. In 1992, it made operating
profits of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds 48.2m. At the end of 1992, its
tangible assets were Pounds 20.3m; after deducting dividends to P&amp;O and
before an intra-group loan note of about Pounds 11m that Baynes is also
acquiring, assets will fall to Pounds 15.5m at October 2.
Mr Perkins said that Baynes' balance sheet would remain strong: after the
buy shareholders' funds will stand at about Pounds 40m after some Pounds 17m
goodwill write-off from B&amp;H.
Group operating profits in the half grew to Pounds 3.09m (Pounds 1.62m) on
turnover up at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 37.2m). Acquisitions in the period
contributed Pounds 735,000 and Pounds 7.52m respectively. On an annualised
basis continuing businesses made profits of Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 1.52m) on
turnover flat at Pounds 31.8m. Margins were improved through job losses and
Baynes capital expenditure programmes.
The interim dividend is lifted to 0.575p (0.525p), payable from adjusted
earnings of 1.65p (1.05p) per share.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wm Baird 12% down in difficult trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering group, blamed difficult trading
conditions in the UK for a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half
ended June.
They declined from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.77m on reduced sales of Pounds
230.6m, compared with Pounds 242.7m. The shares fell 3p to 285p.
Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said there had been no consistent pattern of
recovery in consumer confidence. The anticipated benefits for UK
manufacturers from the devaluation of sterling last year have not yet had a
discernible effect on business.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 9.7m. Baird Textiles
contributed Pounds 7.02m (Pounds 8.53m) on increased turnover of Pounds
203.6m (Pounds 195.3m).
Darchem, which recently sold its engineering division to the Weir Group for
about Pounds 16m, reported lower profits of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.87m).
Mr Parr hoped to sell the remaining building services and engineering
companies shortly. However, he said: 'There is no emergency; they are still
making profits. If it takes us another year to dispose of them so be it.'
Borrowings of Pounds 25m are expected to be eliminated by the year end.
Lower interest rates led to a fall in net interest charges to Pounds 979,000
(Pounds 1.5m).
Earnings per share fell to 5.2p (6p). The interim dividend is maintained at
3.55p.
COMMENT
The UK recovery may be taking longer than anticipated but the fall in
textile margins disappointed the market. Regardless of how slow the upturn
proves to be, the benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling are
likely to flow through before the end of the second half. That should help
the group to increase annual pre-tax profits to some Pounds 27m. But it may
not be enough to make investors happy. A good acquisition might do the
trick. That probably depends on how quick Baird can dispose of Darchem. If
precedence is anything to go by it is likely to take longer than expected.
The stock will look more attractive next year, but for now the shares - on a
prospective multiple of 17.3 - are high enough.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: US goodwill write-off hits Amec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits at Amec, the UK construction, engineering and
property company, slipped from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 9.1m despite a modest
increase at the operating level.
Operating profits were ahead at Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.3m) but Amec's
pre-tax profits were reduced by the write-off of Pounds 2.2m of goodwill on
US businesses sold and the group paid Pounds 1.9m interest against Pounds
300,000 interest received last year.
The board cut the interim dividend to 1.5p (2p) to reflect more closely the
group's split on earnings between interim and final results. It expects at
least to maintain last year's 3p total at the year end, 'unless conditions
deteriorate significantly.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.04bn). Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman,
said: 'Turnover was slightly higher than last year but there were very, very
significant variations in the type of work carried out and its geographical
location.' The company's order book was down 7 per cent overall at the half
way stage.
Orders had grown, however, in oil, gas and petrochemical activities, matched
by progress in heavy electrical and mechanical engineering.
Sir Alan added: 'Steady growth in construction in mainland Europe,
particularly in Germany and in south-east Asia has partially offset
significant reductions in our UK building and business services work.'
Gearing at June 30 was 15 per cent (2 per cent).
Contracting, 'substantially' financed by subcontractors and materials
suppliers, improved turnover to Pounds 346.3m (Pounds 330.9m) giving profits
virtually flat at Pounds 5.5m.
Mechanical and electrical engineering, including process and engineering,
showed increased activity at Pounds 741.9m (Pounds 680.4m) giving profits of
Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.8m) but the business has an in-built lag between
labour costs and payments.
The housing and property business improved sales to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds
40.5m), but losses deepened to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 2.1m).
COMMENT
Amec has tackled the difficult business cycle in contracting by diversifying
its work in terms of both types of project and geography and it believes its
problems in some overseas operations are behind it. Its workload is skewed
more now towards the resilient process and energy sectors and away from
lacklustre contracting. The former has been a cash drain but this should
turn around in the second half. Amec expects to be ungeared at the year end
as payments come in. Meanwhile falling orders indicate the company's
restraint in bidding for unprofitable work. Full year pre-tax profits are
forecast at Pounds 25m giving fully diluted earnings of 7.8p and a
prospective multiple of 12. This looks cheap compared with other companies
in the sector but they have bigger exposure than Amec to the housing
recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a further expansion move into the Asia Pacific region, International
Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks sector of Grand Metropolitan, has set up a
new company to market and distribute IDV brands in China.
IDV has appointed Mr TY Wong as managing director of the new company,
International Distillers China, who will have his head office in Hong Kong,
with three new representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Mr John McGrath, a GrandMet director and IDV's chief executive, said that
with a population of 1.2bn, China had a total spirits market of about 50m
cases a year, of which international spirit brands account for 700,000
cases. This sector increased by 40 per cent last year which, he said,
demonstrated enormous potential for future growth.
Last year IDV set up its own and joint venture distribution companies
covering Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and South
Korea.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: OGC sale lifts Fairhaven to Dollars 37m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of 40 per cent of OGC International enabled Fairhaven
International, the Bermuda-based specialist oil contractor, to achieve a
jump in pre-tax profits from Dollars 9.27m to Dollars 37.4m (Pounds 24.7m)
in the half year to June 30.
Turnover fell from Dollars 246m to Dollars 207m and operating profits were
lower at Dollars 7.25m (Dollars 9.27m). The net gain on the OGC sale
amounted to Dollars 30.2m.
Earnings per share worked through at 13.9 cents (2.5 cents) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 0.5 cents (0.2 cents).
OGC International, which was floated in May, also announced its results
yesterday with a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.77m to Pounds 5.3m
for the first half of 1993. That was achieved despite a fall in turnover of
continuing operations to Pounds 97.1m (Pounds 110m).
Earnings improved to 5.69p (4.97p) per share and a dividend of 1.75p is
declared.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Plasmec shares react to poor first half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shares of Plasmec were marked down 12p to 66p yesterday as the group
announced that it had run into a Pounds 237,000 loss in the first half of
1993 and was halving the dividend to 0.75p.
The group makes products for telecommunications and switching, and
electronic and mechanical systems.
A satisfactory profit was expected for the second half, to put the group in
a strong position to enter 1994.
Sales suffered a 19 per cent fall to Pounds 5.96m (Pounds 7.32m). That was
blamed on completion of the contract for Littlewoods Pools, the decline in
microfilm reader business, and the sluggish pace of business recovery in the
first quarter.
The impact on operating profit was a decline of 55 per cent. There was a
restructuring provision of Pounds 313,000.
Losses per share were 3.6p (earnings 4.3p).

A DROP IN interest income led to a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.02m
to Pounds 1.82m at Stat-Plus group in the first half of 1993.
The group sells legal stationery, printing and law forms publishing.
Sales in the half year were broadly unchanged at Pounds 6.03m while
operating profit rose 7 per cent to Pounds 1.39m. Gross margins were
maintained and overheads reduced, leading to a considerable improvement
overall to the final six months of 1992.
The outlook for the remainder of the year would depend to a considerable
degree on the speed of the recovery in the housing market. Cash deposits
stood at Pounds 13.8m.
Earnings per share came to 5.7p (6.3p) but the interim dividend is stepped

FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Arjo plans flotation in London
and Stockholm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO, the international healthcare group based in Sweden, is planning to
come to the market this autumn in London and Stockholm with a share offering
worth up to SKr1.75bn (Pounds 145m).
Up to 70 per cent of the shares will be offered in London to international
institutions, up to 20 per cent to retail investors in Sweden and the rest
to US and other continental European investors.
Arjo, which claims to be a world leader in hygiene and lifting systems for
elderly and disabled patients, was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in
December 1990 from Malmros International, a Swedish conglomorate.
Arjo aims to eliminate its borrowings - now SKr1.3bn - through the
flotation.
Last year Arjo reported a pre-tax loss of SKr4.6m on sales of SKr809.1m.
Operating profits of SKr124.7m were overshadowed by financial charges of
Skr129.3m.
At present Arjo's two largest shareholders are CWB Capital Partners and
Warburg Pincus Investors, who will each hold about 38 per cent of the share
capital before the offer. Arjo said that CWB Capital Partners would be
selling a small proportion of its shares, leaving it with a holding of 10 to
15 per cent.
Warburg Pincus intended to increase its holding by subscribing for new
shares with funds from the redemption of Arjo debt securities. Arjo said
Warburg Pincus would have between 20 and 25 per cent of the shares after the
offering.
Existing shareholders will sell no more than SKr250m of shares, Arjo said.
Mr Hans Lindstrom, chief executive, said yesterday that Arjo made 97 per
cent of its sales outside Sweden, with markets in 40 different countries.
The main customers were hospitals, nursing homes and home care
organisations.
Last year Germany accounted for 26.8 per cent of group sales, with the US on
18.6 per cent and the UK on 15.7 per cent. Half the manufacturing is based
in Sweden, 25 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US.
SG Warburg Securities will sponsor the listing in London, while Carnegie
Fondkommission is to sponsor the Stockholm listing. SG Warburg Securities
will also act as global co-ordinator for the offering, with James Capel and
Carnegie Fondkommission as co-lead managers.

the first half of 1993.
The independent oil and gas company reported pre-tax profit of Pounds
641,000, against a Pounds 161,000 loss previously, and profits of Pounds
818,000 for 1992.
Teredo Petroleum, acquired in May, contributed to the profits and also to
the increased sales figure of Pounds 8.2m, against Pounds 5.7m.
Cairn said the main cause of the sales advance was the US gas price in the
period which, for the group's share of production, averaged Dollars 2.09 per
thousand standard cu ft, compared with an average of Dollars 1.59
previously.
Earnings per share came through at 1.21p (losses 0.66p).
Teredo properties, which are mainly onshore UK and Spain, had produced good
cash flow and a strong contribution from this source was expected in the
second half. In addition cost savings were expected to be achieved by the
closure of Teredo's London office.
Gearing had been reduced significantly by the Pounds 5.2m placing and open
offer in May and the issue and sale of shares in CEUSA, the US subsidiary,
in July.
The company said that in the half year exploration costs previously incurred
on North Sea licences had been carried at Pounds 6.5m.
Changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax regime and the reduced exploration
drilling in the North Sea might effect the carrying value of these licences.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield shares fall 29p despite profits
rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Burnfield, the West Midlands-based specialist engineer, improved
from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.27m pre-tax for the six months ended July 2.
The market, however, was disappointed with the results and marked the
group's share price down by 29p to 124p.
Mr Brian McGowan, chairman, said the business climate 'remained
unpredictable'. He pointed out that some recovery was apparent in the US,
demand in the UK was variable and recessionary forces continued to affect
the group's French and German markets.
Sales for the half year improved from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 18.4m, which
included Pounds 1.16m from acquisitions. Earnings per share dipped to 2.2p
(3.9p) but the interim dividend is being maintained at 1.65p.
The results included a one-off Pounds 300,000 provision to restructure
Isopad's operation in France and thus eliminate losses. The Isopad offshoot
is a maker of heating products.
At period end group net borrowings were Pounds 2.5m compared with net cash
balances of Pounds 3.1m at end-December 1992. The movement primarily
reflected the acquisition of Desgranges et Huot in March for Pounds 5.2m,
including assumed borrowings.
Mr McGowan said the overall outlook for Burnfield was encouraging. He said
the balance sheet remained strong which enabled the group to 'focus on
growth, both organic and by appropriate acquisitions'.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Streamlining and cost cuts bolster Blenheim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Blenheim Group's share price dived sharply yesterday the directors
said improved overhead and direct cost control, as well as continued
streamlining of the exhibition group's portfolio of events, had contributed
to a rise in interim operating margins from 22 per cent to 24 per cent.
The shares closed 43p down at 355p.
Turnover rose by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 80.4m and pre-tax profits were 17.6
per cent ahead at Pounds 15.4m in the six months to June 30.
Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 11.2p (9.7p) and the interim
dividend is lifted 13 per cent to 3.4p, compared with a pro-forma 3p.
At constant exchange rates, pre-tax profits and earnings increased by 6 per
cent.
The group confirmed it still intended to pay dividends for the year of not
less than 10.25p, representing an annualised increase of about 14 per cent
over the annualised dividend for the 16 months to December.
Average visitor attendance at the group's trade exhibitions improved
marginally. There was a net cash inflow from operations of Pounds 26.5m.
Blenheim said that as of August 23, 97 per cent of projected exhibition
space revenues for the financial year to December had either been realised
or contracted.
COMMENT
It was not the respectable half-year results which did the damage, but the
downgrading of future profit forecasts. The market is never kind to former
go-go companies which puncture high hopes, and there is nothing analysts
like less than a change in tune of this kind - particularly so soon after a
big cash-raising operation. Most concern centres on the outlook for France
and Germany next year, when any currency effect is likely to be adverse.
There is also a fear that the unexpectedly large spending on new launches
may mask more fundamental problems. There has been growing scepticism about
Blenheim's recession-beating performance, and this debacle has certainly
handed the initiative to bears on the stock. The group's credibility is
likely to remain fragile - and would certainly not survive any more nasty
surprises.

FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wimpey in black with Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, moved back into profit
in the first-half and said that a significant upturn in UK housing sales
earlier this year would be reflected in second-half profits.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.1m against losses of Pounds 24.6m, restated
for FRS 3, after a Pounds 11.2m loss on disposals.
Earnings per share were 0.17p (losses of 8.48p) and the interim dividend is
being maintained at its reduced rate of 2p per share - it was halved at the
interim stage last year.
Operating profits were Pounds 7.3m, against losses of Pounds 1.1m, on
turnover down from Pounds 730.7m to Pounds 700.2m.
The results were accompanied by cautiously optimistic comments from Mr Joe
Dwyer, chief executive, who said: 'We now have evidence of a change in the
underlying trading environment for our business. The barometer is moving
gradually towards a more favourable climate.
'Our housing sales are running well ahead of last year and these will come
through to profit in the second half.' However, he also warned that 'the
overhang of recession will take a long time to clear'.
Worldwide house completions fell slightly to 3,251 (3,343) during the first
half reflecting the slow start to the year. However, the spring upturn in
the UK housing market expanded rapidly and meant that by the end of June
total UK house sales, including housing association homes, were 59 per cent
higher at 4,961 (3,125).
Housebuilding contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.6m) to total trading profits
of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 1.2m losses) on turnover of Pounds 195.4m (Pounds
215.7m). Construction edged back into trading profits of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
1.5m losses) although the value of the construction order book fell slightly
to Pounds 590m (Pounds 600m).
In property, further lettings lifted the percentage of let space to 61 per
cent and the division reported reduced trading losses of Pounds 300,000
(Pounds 1.9m).
Trading in the group's principal UK and North American aggregates markets
remained tough but trading profits for the minerals side were Pounds 4.5m
(Pounds 900,000) helped by a one-off Pounds 6.7m profit in the waste
management business.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 12.2m) reflecting reduced
year-on-year borrowings and lower interest rates. Net borrowings at the end
of June were Pounds 158m, representing gearing of 36 per cent.
COMMENT
Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue in June has provided the funds to bolster
the balance sheet and to make ready for the recovery by extending the land
bank and providing cash for the minerals businesses which could begin to
deliver good returns a few years down the line. More immediately the core
housebuilding business is on target to benefit from cheaper land and an
improving mix which should begin to boost margins. With luck the group could
make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 29.5m this year, rising to Pounds 60m
next year. Based on yesterday's share price of 184p this year's prospective
p/e of 20 looks lofty, but for longer term investors the shares are trading
at a slight discount to the sector.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Soros buys into US property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US property fund set up earlier this year by George Soros and advised by
Paul Reichmann, former head of Olympia &amp; York, yesterday made its first
investment as it paid Dollars 634m (Pounds 419m) for a block of properties
and property loans from Travelers, the US insurer.
Also yesterday, Soros' Quantum Fund revealed a plan to set up a new UK
property fund to take on its interest in a Pounds 500m joint venture with
British Land, the UK property group, which was announced in June.
Shares in the new fund, denominated in sterling, could eventually be listed
separately in London.
The disposal by Travelers marks the insurer's first bulk sale of properties
since an announcement in February that it intended to accelerate the
disposal of Dollars 5bn of underperforming property loans and properties
acquired as a result of defaults on commercial mortgages.
Quantum Realty Fund, the Soros US property fund launched in March, bought 35
properties and 12 commercial mortgage loans, representing 6m square feet of
commercial space and 6,000 residential units.
Travelers said the money raised would be reinvested in higher-yielding
assets, principally corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds. Neither
side would disclose the yield on the underperforming properties, but Mr
Reichmann said the investment brings 'strong current cashflow as well as the
prospect for significant capital appreciation as the property markets
recover later in the decade'.
Quantum Realty will put up around Dollars 210m, with a further Dollars 90m
being provided Mr Soros and various Soros family investment vehicles. The
rest has come from a bridging loan, which will be refinanced by an issue of
mortgage-backed securities. The leverage in the fund could be increased in
the future by a further securitisation in the form of a property investment
trust, Mr Soros said.
Following the Travelers deal, the Quantum Realty Fund will still have
Dollars 500m of equity to invest in properties.
Meanwhile, the Quantum Fund said the plan to spin off its UK property
interests would not alter the terms of its relationship with British Land,
in which the investment fund owns 11m shares.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Unilever to make 20% of US ice cream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, is set to become the
largest US ice cream maker with the purchase of the ice cream business of
Kraft General Foods, part of Philip Morris, the tobacco and food group.
The Kraft business has annual sales of almost Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m).
Added to Unilever's existing US ice cream sales of about Dollars 200m, it
will give the Anglo-Dutch group nearly a fifth of a market worth more than
Dollars 3bn a year.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Mr John Campbell, of stockbrokers
NatWest Securities in London, estimated it was worth about Dollars 300m.
Kraft said last month that it had received an approach from an unnamed
company interested in the business, which sells ice creams and frozen
yoghurts under brands including Breyers, Sealtest, Knudsen and Light N'
Lively.
Acquisition of the business will introduce Unilever into the US bulk ice
cream sector, the largest part of the total market.
Until now, Unilever has focused in the US entirely on 'impulse' ice creams,
which are sold for immediate consumption. It has recently acquired popular
US brands, including Gold Bond and Klondike.
Though Breyers and Sealtest are among the best-known US brands, their market
share and profitability have deteriorated sharply in recent years, and
Unilever is likely to have to invest substantially to restore their
position. Growth of supermarket sales of bulk ice creams have slowed to 2
per cent in the past year. But the value of KGF's ice cream sales fell
slightly, while operating margins have narrowed to about 2 per cent.
The weaker performance partly reflects increased competition which Breyers
has faced from newer 'super-premium' ice creams, which sell at higher
prices. Though KGF has launched its own super-premium line, results have
been disappointing. Sealtest's sales have fallen 10 per cent to Dollars 63m
in the past year and it has been forced to cut prices sharply.
The KGF ice cream business employs about 2,000 people and has plants in six
US states.
Unilever is Europe's biggest ice cream producer, with about 40 per cent of a
market worth Dollars 4bn a year.

FT  09 SEP 93 / IRI stakes in BCI and Credito Italiano set for public float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company, has abandoned plans for the trade
sale of its majority stakes in Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito
Italiano in favour of public share offerings.
The move was widely welcomed yesterday, with Milan bourse operators
suggesting the decision to opt for a public flotation could give a much
needed boost to the stock market. IRI's shares in the two banks - it has 67
per cent of Credito and 57 per cent of BCI - will also be floated on foreign
stock exchanges.
The timing of the flotation has yet to be announced and IRI, headed by Mr
Romano Prodi, yesterday declined to place a notional value on its two
holdings.
However, IRI will shortly select advisers and a lead manager. The absence of
any indication on pricing resulted in cautious trading yesterday in the two
shares on the Milan bourse, with BCI shares down 2.1 per cent and Credito up
1.3 per cent.
IRI is under pressure to complete the deals as soon as possible to offset
its increasingly parlous financial position. It has borrowings of L72,500bn
(Pounds 30.2bn) and losses this year are expected to reach L5,300bn.
Last October Merrill Lynch was hired to advise on the sale of Credito with
the aim of finding either a large domestic financial institution or a
foreign buyer to absorb part or all of IRI's holding. Since then no Italian
financial institution has shown much enthusiasm for what is Italy's sixth
largest bank.
Some 27 foreign institutions were also sounded out.
Estimates of the total value of the bank also varied from L6,000bn to
L10,000bn while the stock market capitalisation is around L2,000bn.
By opting for a public flotation, IRI is now seeking wider ownership for the
two banks. This includes clients and employees who will be given preference
along the lines of some UK privatisations. The government is expected to
encourage the formation of a small hard core of domestic institutional
investors.
The government first announced plans to sell IRI's stake in Credito some 12
months ago. At the time the government was thinking in terms of matching BCI
with the state owned Banco Nazionale di Lavoro. A BNL-BCI alliance is now
formally excluded.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Blenheim shares plunge on downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Blenheim Group plunged 43p to a two-year low of 355p yesterday
after analysts sharply reduced their profit forecasts for the acquisitive
international exhibition organiser.
Analysts said the formerly highly rated stock had suffered a substantial
blow to its credibility after BZW, the joint house broker, along with Credit
Lyonnais Laing, cut its profit forecast for the second time in three months.
Blenheim, which had seemed to survive the recession better than many other
media stocks, suffered this downgrade in spite of reporting an 18 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.4m in the six months to June 30.
Analysts were particularly concerned about the deteriorating situation in
France, which accounted for 27 per cent of group trading profit in the first
half. For the first time, the group said it might have to discount the
charges it levels on participants in trade exhibitions.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said: 'With only one-fifth of profits derived
from the UK, Blenheim's results are heavily dependent on the economies of
France, the US and Germany and their relevant sterling exchange rates,
particularly in the second half.'
The group said there had been some signs of revival in the US and UK, but
France and Germany had continued to deteriorate, resulting in flatter
overall sales volumes. Next year's profits will also suffer from the absence
of the large biennial Batimat exhibition in France.
Mr Buch also revealed an expanded launch programme of 26 exhibitions for
1994, which is likely to cost at least Pounds 4m. He said: 'Investment in
new products is not expected to show an immediate return, but it is our
intention to continue to improve the competitive position of our portfolio
of events in the international exhibition market.'
BZW cut its profits forecast for the full year from Pounds 49m to Pounds 45m
and for next year from Pounds 55m to Pounds 43m. Smith New Court, which has
long been bearish on the stock, is going for only Pounds 40m next year.
There is considerable irritation in the City that the reduced profits
outlook has emerged so soon after the June convertible share issue, in which
Blenheim raised Pounds 75.8m to fund acquisitions in the US and continental
Europe.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Market disappointed with P&amp;O
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday disappointed the
market with lower than expected profits before disposals. The shares fell
49p to 619p.
Lord Sterling, chairman, said: 'It would have been abundantly clear to
anyone who read our annual report that the UK recovery is slower than
anticipated. It is a delusion to think we can surge ahead while Germany and
France remain deep in recession.'
The company almost doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 291.6m, from Pounds
151.2m, on the back of increased sales of businesses in the half year to the
end of June. Turnover rose to Pounds 2.7bn (from Pounds 2.5bn).
Pre-tax profits before disposals fell 11 per cent to Pounds 80.1m, mainly
due to a big fall in profits from container and bulk shipping.
Gains from the devaluation of sterling and a strong US dollar were more than
offset by difficulties in Asia which were behind shipping's 58 per cent
profit fall to Pounds 11m.
After the sale of Sutcliffe, the contract caterer, borrowings fell from
Pounds 1.89bn at the end of December to Pounds 1.73bn at the end of June.
Net interest payable rose to Pounds 66.9m (from Pounds 53.8m).
Further disposals are expected to follow yesterday's announcement of the
sale of Buck and Hickman, a distributor of engineers' supplies, to Charles
Baynes for Pounds 32.5m.
A scrip dividend is also offered to preserve cash. Its value of 36p compares
with an ordinary dividend of 24p. For each share offered under the issue
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is offering cash of 35.28p.
If all shareholders take up the scrip dividend alternative the group would
retain cash of Pounds 163m, representing a saving on the 1993 dividend of
Pounds 128m and a further Pounds 35m of advance corporation tax.
Lord Sterling said the total dividend is expected to remain unchanged at
30.5p.
The group is considering appealing to the European Commission over the
Department of Trade and Industry's refusal to allow it to work with other
ferry operators on the Dover-Calais route to head off the competition from
Eurotunnel.
Lord Sterling said: 'The DTI's decision defies rational explanation.'
Earnings per share rose to 40.1p (from 20.9p).

FT  09 SEP 93 / Pru slips to Pounds 242m at halfway stage: Underlying
profits rise 14% - Interim dividend increased 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, yesterday
reported an interim profit fall to Pounds 242m from Pounds 249m a year ago,
but said underlying profits rose 14 per cent at current exchange rates.
It raised its interim dividend almost 10 per cent to 4.5p per share. Profits
for the 1992 period were boosted by a one-off gain of Pounds 52m resulting
from a restructuring of assets in the shareholders' portfolio.
The Prudential's general insurance business earned Pounds 18m in the six
months ended June 30, against a loss last time of Pounds 21m. The company's
Mercantile and General Reinsurance business pared its loss to Pounds 7m from
Pounds 25m.
The company has withdrawn from general insurance and has raised premiums in
many of its personal lines. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said the
company will remain in personal lines. 'We are writing this business to give
us access to UK households so we can sell them long-term business,' Mr
Newmarch said, noting that under half of the Pru's personal lines customers
have long-term savings products.
Profits from long-term investment-related business were flat at Pounds 200m.
The company has set aside an undisclosed sum to cover anticipated bonus
reductions on its with-profits policies which are not set until the
year-end. The Pru and other insurers have cut bonus rates in line with lower
investment returns in recent years and Mr Newmarch has said he believes
further reductions are necessary.
In the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of the Pru's sales, annual premium
sales subsided reflecting a drop in so-called industrial branch business
which requires house-to-house collections of premiums.
However, single-premium business jumped to Pounds 1.4bn in new business from
just over Pounds 1bn a year ago, largely due to hefty sales of the company's
single-premium with-profits bond, the Prudence Bond.
Mr Newmarch said he believes that the extensive cost-cutting efforts the
company has made in its life division will help it gain market share once
new rules on disclosure take effect next year. 'It's what the new disclosure
regime is all about. You have got to demonstrate value to your customers,'
he said.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Decline of 'steady job' creating an unstable society, says
Monks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EROSION of employment security in Britain is creating an unstable
society and contributing to the rise in crime, Mr John Monks, the TUC's
general secretary elect, warned yesterday.
In his first speech to the Congress at Brighton, Mr Monks said 'overmighty
unions' were a thing of the past. 'Dictatorship of the bad employer' was
today's reality for far too many people, he said.
His address, which was politely rather than enthusiastically received, was
partly overshadowed by the continuing argument over the readmission of the
electricians' union to the TUC.
After the speech, Mr Monks attended an emergency meeting of union leaders
which agreed that complainant unions could put their case to the general
council today.
His speech reflected his efforts to reach beyond the union movement's
blue-collar, northern stereotype with a theme of the decline of the 'steady
job'.
'What's on offer today is fixed-term contracts, contract working, part-time
working, all too often forced down people's throats,' Mr Monks said. 'It's
as true now for the white-collar professional as it is for the manual
worker. It's as true in the south as it is in the north.'
He linked rising crime and drug addiction to the effects that 'unemployment,
casualisation and no prospects are having'.
Britain, he added, was no longer the workshop of the world but had become 'a
warehouse bulging with imports'.
Mr Monks, who has developed a friendly relationship with Mr David Hunt, the
employment secretary, said the TUC wanted 'to contribute to public policy on
training, health and safety, employment law and making Britain work better'.
He said he would be testing Mr Hunt's offer of an 'open door' to the TUC.
Officials said later a meeting with Mr Hunt had been planned and training
would be at the top of the agenda.
On a more optimistic note, Mr Monks told Congress: 'The tide of opinion is
turning and in it lies the force which can be harnessed to regenerate
British trade unionism.'
He said raising the morale of active trade unionists would be crucial to the
campaigns ahead, particularly efforts to persuade members to vote for the
automatic 'check-off' of union dues by employers.
Mr Monks, who takes over as general secretary on Friday, is more comfortable
in the TV studio than the conference hall but most delegates said his
address reflected the key themes facing the unions.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Privatisation of BR will go ahead, MacGregor reaffirms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE determination of the gov-ernment to proceed with the privatisation of
British Rail, despite criticism from some Tory backbenchers, was reaffirmed
last night by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
He clearly indicated that the Commons would be asked to overturn the
amendment made to the railways bill by the House of Lords. The alterations
made by the Lords would permit BR to bid for franchises to operate passenger
services.
The amendment, which the government claims would undermine the whole
franchising process, received favourable comments from Tory backbenchers
representing constituencies in the south-east who are worried about the
implications of privatisation for commuter fares.
With its majority reduced by recent by-election reverses, even a small
rebellion by Tory backbenchers would cause anxiety for the government
because the amendment is certain to have the backing of most opposition MPs.
In a speech to leaders of the CBI last night, Mr MacGregor looked to
individual BR managers to join private-sector interests in the franchising
process.
He forecast that it would bring competition and induce pressures to raise
quality, attract custom, and reduce costs.
Mr MacGregor described franchises as the best way of bringing together the
experience of existing BR managers and the best from the private sector.
He said: 'Each franchisee will have an incentive to improve his efficiency
and profits within the terms of the franchise specification. And he knows he
will have to compete with newcomers at the next franchise round.'
Mr MacGregor maintained that privatisation would create a railway industry
responsive to market forces where previously there had been a bureaucratic
monolith answerable to ministerial or bureaucratic edict.
He suggested that many of the franchises were likely to be owned by
companies or consortia with local and regional interests.
Stressing that bus operators were interested in franchises, Mr MacGregor
said they were 'natural investments for finance or service companies with
strong regional connections'.

FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Actuaries UK indices committee is grappling with a slippery
subject when it tries to define a UK company. Thus far, the pragmatic
yardstick that companies prepared to pay UK tax are UK companies has held up
reasonably well. But the proposed structure for New Rothmans and Vendome has
shown up the inadequacies of the definition. The deal is pretty clearly
designed to minimise advance corporation tax problems by creating parallel
UK and overseas companies which are permanently stapled together, but which
also allow shareholders to select a UK or overseas dividend. Other UK
companies with ACT headaches might in future be tempted to follow similar
paths.
Yet this problem is primarily a function of the difficulties of advance
corporation tax, rather than the degree of 'Britishness' of the company.
Other hard cases such as Eurotunnel remain eligible despite the vagueness
which surrounds the status of dividend payments the company hopes, one day,
to make. Nor, apparently, will those who make use of the government's
proposed foreign income dividends be excluded from UK indices. The issue of
partly split dividends where one element is a compulsory UK taxed payment
remains mercifully vague.
Taxation as a means of separating sheep from goats has thus probably had its
day. A wider look at the issue is needed, and a useful starting point might
be consideration of what investors want an index to tell them. Exposure to a
local economy and corporate governance are perhaps key issues, though given
the high level of overseas earnings in FT-SE 100 companies, the difficulty
of designing a genuinely UK index is clearly acute.

FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of a Dollars 500m-turnover US company, the biggest in its
field, would rank as a material transaction in most people's books. But for
Unilever, the agreement to buy Kraft General Foods' ice cream business
counts as little more than a handy bolt-on acquisition. Given that the
consideration represents less than 5 per cent of Unilever's assets, it is
not even obliged to disclose the purchase price.
Unilever has long desired to bolster its US foods interests. Adding KGF to
its existing US ice cream business will make Unilever market leader in a
fragmented field and will doubtless provide opportunities for distribution
and marketing synergies. Unilever may have its work cut out reversing KGF's
recent weak trading run. But Unilever seems unlikely to have paid over the
odds. It can afford to wait.
Philip Morris's decision to sell out of ice cream is indicative of the trend
among food manufacturers to narrow their focus on fewer markets in which
they have a dominant position. Unilever has already gone a long way to
winnowing out its brand portfolio. But in Europe, Nestle and BSN have
scarcely begun the process. The difficulties of managing weaker brands are
escalating by the day as retailer power grows stronger. Asset swaps among
the bigger operators may become an increasingly frequent feature of the food
scene.

FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the stock market's distrust of the life insurance sector
that yesterday's 10 per cent increase in Prudential's interim dividend
barely drew a response. While the immediate prospects for dividend growth
turn on cash profits from old business now maturing, the government's demand
for full disclosure of commissions threatens to undermine new business
prospects. Until the impact of reform is clear, that uncertainty outweighs
the promise of a rising dividend.
Still, Prudential looks better equipped than most to deal with both
disclosure and increased competition from banks and building societies.
Disclosure should favour companies with low costs and efficient
distribution. The Pru's continuing drive to reorganise its sales force -
with the prospect of cost savings of Pounds 100m a year - is thus
encouraging. Recent links built with independent financial advisers through
sales of the Prudence Bond contribute to a useful diversity of distribution.
Prudential also has sufficient scale to look elsewhere if its traditional
market remains clouded. The prospects in Asia are exciting, but only for the
long term. In the US, Jackson National's annuity products are less
attractive in an era of low interest rates, so diversification into other
areas makes sense. There is equally a chance that consolidation in UK life
insurance will bring opportunities to buy market share. While the high level
of gearing remains an obstacle, Mr Mick Newmarch has built sufficient
support among investors not to let it pen him in.

FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Heavy weather at P&amp;O
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many UK companies, P&amp;O could do with a decent dose of inflation. Not
only would this swell the value of its Pounds 4bn asset base and shrink the
relative burden of its Pounds 1.7bn of debt. It would also enable P&amp;O to
push through much-needed price rises in its housebuilding and shipping arms.
As it is, although P&amp;O is seeing a pick-up of activity in many areas, it is
experiencing little improvement in margins. This joyless recovery has left
it with creaking timbers as an 11 per cent decline in net pre-tax profits
illustrates. The 7 per cent fall in the company's stock price reflects
renewed doubts about P&amp;O's ability to sustain its hefty dividend.
P&amp;O's enhanced scrip dividend temporarily eases the pressure since it
effectively works as a minor rights issue. It saves Pounds 35m of tax from
disappearing into the chancellor's pocket, and preserves Pounds 163m of
cash. But the scrip dividend will only pile up future financial worries for
P&amp;O. If fully taken up, it will expand P&amp;O's equity by about 6 per cent.
That will prove expensive to finance given the stock's yield of 6.5 per
cent.
More robust economic recovery, if not inflation, could yet save P&amp;O's
blushes. But it will take P&amp;O several years to generate the profits needed
to rebuild cover sufficiently to contemplate any dividend increase. The
added longer-term worry is that P&amp;O has recently been selling the ballast
that enabled it to keep an even keel during the downturn. The stable
earnings contributions from companies such as Sutcliffe can no longer be
relied upon in future.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Leading Article: First world debt burdens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE extraordinary buoyancy of global bond markets is giving the biggest
debtors in the developed world an exceptionally comfortable run for their
money. One indication of the benign climate for borrowers is that Italy,
with a public sector debt stock of more than 110 per cent of gross domestic
product, is preparing to launch a record multi-billion dollar debt issue in
the international markets. Another is that the UK Treasury, whose
performance on inflation has been conspicuously poor, has already met
two-thirds of its funding needs in the first five months of the financial
year. Is there a risk that the seeds of a first world debt crisis are now
being sown?
Certainly debt in the developed world has been creeping ominously upwards.
The OECD estimates that in the five years to 1994 net public debt will rise
from just over 31 per cent to 39 per cent of GDP. Within these figures the
debt burden is heavily biased towards Europe, where the build-up is expected
to accelerate sharply over the same period from 41 per cent to 54 per cent
of GDP. Yet the bond markets remain enthusiastic; and their enthusiasm is
increasingly directed at those countries whose poor past performance in
managing public finances results in higher than average yields.
Bond yields
Convergence in bond yields, a process originally sparked by the push for
monetary union in Europe, seems not to have been destroyed by the debacle in
the European exchange rate mechanism. Today, 10-year bonds in Britain,
France and Germany all trade within the same narrow band of between 6 and 7
per cent, despite these countries' very different experiences of inflation
over the past three decades. Countries such as Italy and Belgium, meantime,
are diversifying their borrowings into foreign currencies. This provides
reassurance to creditors, in the sense that the debtor cannot go down the
route of inflation and devaluation without facing a huge increase in the
real burden of foreign debt. But it also raises the stakes sharply for a
debtor struggling with intractable budgetary problems.
The markets are unquestionably right about one thing. Inflation is not a
global problem at present. The question is rather whether the risk of
default, either directly or through inflation, is adequately discounted in
the bond prices of individual countries. Given that real debt yields in the
more heavily indebted countries tend still to be above the likely trend of
growth in GDP, debt stabilisation will still call for some unpalatable
fiscal measures. In other words investors are taking a great deal on trust.
Market liberalisation
The best reason for thinking that fund managers may not have taken leave of
their senses is that the liberalisation of currency and financial markets,
as well as making it easier to borrow, has made it harder to default.
Governments know that if policy ceases to be credible, international markets
will simply switch off the financial tap. In the absence of exchange
controls, politicians can no longer rig domestic markets to ensure that
investors buy their IOUs. They have little option but to monetise maturing
debt by borrowing from domestic banks, the equivalent of printing money.
This argument would certainly provide a rationalisation for the narrowness
of the range within which bond yields have settled. If there is no middle
ground in a world of free capital flows between very low inflation and very
high inflation, then the variations in creditworthiness between different
countries should indeed have narrowed as a result of this increase in the
cost of lax policy.
But the bond market's euphoria rests heavily on the borrowers' recognition
that freedom comes with increased responsibility. The postponement of
politically difficult budgetary decisions simply means that the credit
crunch will be more devastating when it comes. A hint of what might happen
if policy fails to convince came last week when investors started to panic
about Belgium, where net public debt of more than 120 per cent of GDP looks
worrying without the support of an ERM with narrow bands and the prospect of
monetary union.
In the final analysis the crucial judgement is about the politics of the
indebted countries. Too few bond investors are looking beyond the short-term
financial horizon.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Modernising the TUC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OBSTACLES standing in the way of the re-launch of Britain's trade union
movement were on full display at the TUC Congress in Brighton yesterday. The
first big speech by Mr John Monks, as general secretary-elect, was partly
eclipsed by the threat of a walk-out from left-wing unions over the return
of the electricians union to the TUC. The speech was also preceded by a
violently worded debate opposing human resource management techniques,
something which wiser heads in the trade union movement are trying to
influence rather than reject.
Mindful of such constraints, Mr Monks's speech betrayed only glimpses of the
modernising spirit which he seems to represent. It was an address concerned
firstly to establish his standing with the delegates in the hall and only
secondly with the outside world.
Yet the arrival of Mr Monks is to be welcomed. He will speed up the
transition of the TUC itself from a redundant civil service of the labour
movement to a 'centre of excellence' concentrating on a few issues like
occupational pensions and safety at work.
He will also try to distance the unions from the Labour Party - a process
which Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, may have slowed with his effusive
speech to the Congress. The arguments in Mr Monks's speech yesterday about
how employment insecurity contributes to a broader social instability were
aimed at Conservative MP's who cherish family values.
Turning the TUC into a more politically neutral lobbying organisation trying
to establish new coalitions over workplace issues is worthwhile, regardless
of whether Mr Monks can strike up a productive relationship with Mr David
Hunt, the employment secretary.
Constructive relationship
The latter says he has 'an open door' for the TUC, which almost certainly
promises more than it will deliver for the unions. Indeed, although both Mr
Hunt and Mr Monks have their own reasons for wanting to establish a
constructive relationship, it is difficult to imagine what they can usefully
talk about at present, with the possible exception of training.
But to deserve an audience, the TUC must prove its continuing relevance to
employers and employees across a reasonable spread of the UK economy and
that it has realistic proposals for reforming the labour market. There was
little in Mr Monks's speech to indicate much progress on either count.
The insecure workplace is not, as might be expected, causing a resurgence of
trade unionism in Britain and there is no evidence that 'the tide of opinion
is turning . . . to regenerate British trade unionism', as Mr Monks
asserted.
Workplace insurance
Elsewhere he has spoken about appealing to the middle managers of 'middle
England', but this requires more than talking to the government instead of
the Labour Party. It means developing a concept of trade unionism that
transcends collectivism. Some unions are tackling this by providing support
for the negotiation of individual contracts and legal backing for
individuals over redundancies and grievances. Such individual workplace
insurance is not appropriate for all workers, but it could be made
attractive to many more if unions did not hold so many negative associations
for them.
Mr Monks must show he has something relevant to contribute to the public
policy debate beyond denunciation of the new labour market realities. His
speech showed only nostalgia for the age of the steady job, without
discussing the irresistible forces behind greater labour market mobility.
Britain has always had a relatively deregulated labour market, the effects
of which used to be softened for many workers by membership of strong
unions. With the decline of those unions and the rise of more varied forms
of work, there is a case for new forms of labour regulation that combine
minimum standards of protection for employees without placing job-killing
restrictions on employers operating in volatile and flexible markets.
The government is evidently unclear about whether it wants another round of
employment legislation in the near future. But it may be persuaded that new
thinking is required to establish a better combination of flexibility and
security at the workplace. The TUC should be part of that debate.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Brian who?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's most famous jutting jaw and baritone voice were conspicuous by
their absence yesterday. As politicians launched their campaigns for the
October 25 general election, not a squeak came from Brian Mulroney, who
stepped down two months ago as the most unpopular PM in recent Canadian
history. He signed on last month as a senior partner at Ogilvy Renault, a
law firm. His job is to broaden its international links, but no one would be
surprised if Mulroney doesn't try to forge a few himself. He was considered
a few years ago as a candidate for UN secretary-general, and would probably
be interested if a similar job came up.
But for all his famed negotiating skill, Mulroney has a black mark against
his name on the international stage. He has been widely criticised for one
of his final acts as prime minister, which was to recall Don McCutchan,
Canada's representative at the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. McCutchan was the most consistent critic of the EBRD's
high-spending ways. Not surprisingly, Mr McCutchan has landed a less
glamorous job than Mulroney. He started yesterday with Ronald Chisholm, a
Toronto food importer and exporter.

Major said later that the few seconds of conversation overheard by Mynott
involved no security breaches, although Downing Street has started an

FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Mainz and men
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The awful truth is slowly starting to dawn in Germany that perhaps Frankfurt
may not be a foregone conclusion for the site of the future European central
bank. The bank's forerunner, the European Monetary Institute, is supposed to
be up and running by January 1 next year, and still no one can agree where
it should be.
It is not that anyone gives credence to British micawberish optimism that
London still somehow has a chance of hosting the institution itself. It is
merely that the British resistance to Frankfurt, as the rival financial
centre to London, appears to have gained support in Paris.
Step foward the good citizens of Mainz. Barely a stone's throw further from
Frankfurt airport than the German Bundesbank itself, just across the river
Rhine, Mainz believes it can offer almost all the advantages of its
neighbour, without the disadvantage of the name. It can even offer a central
bank building with vacant possession: the former headquarters of the state
central bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate, now amalgamated with that of
neighbouring Saarland.
It has high-level support in Paris, according to French officials in Bonn
for the recent visit of Edouard Balladur. After all, Mayence is more than a
little French; Napoleon made it his military headquarters for one campaign,
and more recently, it was in the French occupation zone of Germany after the
second world war.
Yet the British remain hostile. For them, Mainz is far too close to
Frankfurt for comfort. 'You can almost see the top of the Bundesbank from
Mainz cathedral,' one Whitehall official remarked grimly yesterday.

The last time Observer spoke to Lord Kingsdown, just before he retired as
governor of the Bank of England in June, he said he would love to return to
the private sector, though in his self-deprecating way he said he did not
have a clue whether any big companies would wish to have him as a
non-executive director.
Yesterday the former Robin Leigh-Pemberton, chairman of NatWest till
becoming governor in 1983, landed a directorship at Glaxo, the
pharmaceutical company. There he will join Lord Howe, the former Geoffrey
Howe, who has not played an insignificant role in Lord Kingsdown's past
career. For it was Lord Howe who, as chancellor of the exchequer, offered
Lord Kingsdown the governorship just before Christmas 1982.

Rupert Pennant-Rea, new deputy governor of the Bank of England and erstwhile
editor of the Economist magazine, is at last putting his famous reforming
zeal into practice.
Senior bank staff are in mourning because he has announced the abolition of
the Golden Trough. This is the nickname of the dining room on the fourth
floor of the Bank reserved exclusively for 35 senior officials, including
the department heads. The only identifying mark on the door is a big
'private' sign.
It was set up in the 1930s to allow the chief cashier, who then acted as
Bank chief executive, to keep in touch with the officer class. Since then it
has become, in the words of one stricken official, 'a wonderful perk'.
However, Pennant-Rea believes that such privileges are divisive and
old-fashioned. From January the executives will have to troop across
Lothbury to the staff canteen in King's Arms Yard and eat with the other
ranks.
He is also making the canteen more egalitarian by abolishing a separate area
reserved for principals, the rank below senior officials. However,
Pennant-Rea himself will be able to avoid rubbing shoulders with the troops
over lunch. The directors' private dining room is to be retained.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Curious case of the Abbey's habits: John Gapper says the
actions of a former UK building society have prompted questions about its
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each week, about 100 letters arrive at the headquarters of Abbey National,
the UK mortgage lender and bank, asking for mysteries to be solved. The
letters are addressed to Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional
detective, who lived at 221b Baker Street, Abbey's address. Yet even
Holmes's analytical powers might have been tested by the strange case of the
former building society.
Abbey has behaved oddly of late. Within one month, it has disclosed bad debt
provisions of Pounds 94m in France because of poor commercial property
lending; sold its 347-branch estate agency business for Pounds 8m after
sustaining a loss of Pounds 258m over six years; and set up a joint venture
with Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, to sell companies derivative
financial products such as interest rate swaps and options.
If Abbey were a Conan Doyle character, its relatives would have visited
Holmes to express their bafflement by this time. As it is, its share price
has dropped by 4 per cent relative to the stock market over the past month
and financial analysts have been asking questions. 'Abbey is sending odd
signals to the market by going into derivatives, and I am a bit worried
about it,' says Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Securities, the stockbroker.
Abbey's latest revelations have only added to a sense that it is a curiosity
among UK financial services companies. It is the first and only of the
country's 88 building societies to have converted from mutual ownership.
Since its flotation of shares four years ago, it has carried on raising
money from retail depositors and lending to mortgage borrowers. But it has
also diversified into a series of new businesses.
The biggest diversification has been its growth of treasury assets,
including syndicated commercial loans, debt securities and even six aircraft
leased to British Airways. Its treasury assets have more than doubled since
1990 to Pounds 24.8bn, compared with Pounds 42bn in mortgages. It has reined
in growth of treasury assets this year, but Abbey may eventually have to
allocate a further Pounds 35m of its capital resources to the derivatives
unit.
Profits from Abbey's treasury have helped to maintain its earnings over a
tough period in the housing market. But they have also led to questions over
whether it is taking on risks it does not understand. This happened to TSB,
the retail bank, which has had to make provisions of Pounds 880m on bad
corporate loans made by Hill Samuel, the merchant bank it bought after its
1987 share flotation.
Abbey's management reorganisation announced yesterday is partly an attempt
to prevent mishaps by imposing stronger controls. Yet Mr Peter Birch,
Abbey's chief executive, says it does not mind attracting attention by
marching out of step. 'We are a hybrid,' he says. 'I hope that no other
societies convert because we succeed by being different. If a lot of others
follow, it might clutter our way forward.'
The difficulty is defining exactly what its way forward is. Abbey's
traditional business of mortgage lending using funds deposited by savers has
been squeezed by interest rate falls since Britain left the European
exchange rate mechanism last year. As savers have transferred money into
investments such as unit trusts that offer higher returns, it has become
cheaper to raise funds by borrowing from wholesale money markets.
This has worked in favour of banks such as Abbey in the short term, because
societies have strict limits on wholesale funds. Abbey has sold 23 per cent
of all new mortgages this year, largely using wholesale funds. But its share
of retail savings has fallen, and lending margins have narrowed owing to the
cost of such funds. Its scope to raise margins has been curtailed because
most new mortgages have been fixed rate.
Mr Wriglesworth argues Abbey has made a crucial switch of strategy by
concentrating on wholesale-funded lending. 'It is starting to behave like a
bank rather than a society,' he says. He thinks this could damage Abbey's
ability to ride out future dips in profitability. Because of treasury assets
and fixed-rate lending, its margins are more tightly fixed than its main
competitor, the Halifax Building Society.
As banks try to increase mortgage lending, competition is likely to stiffen.
Yet Abbey's last attempt to defend itself against competition led to its
blunder in estate agency. In common with other societies, it bought agents
to ensure that they would recommend Abbey mortgages. But, by the time of the
sale, it was only selling 5 per cent of its mortgages through its agents,
and had suffered big losses.
The second mistake was to expand into France. It bought a mortgage and
commercial property lending business for Pounds 40m in 1989, but has been
hit by the commercial property downturn. Mr Ian Harley, Abbey's finance
director, says this is one reason why it is no longer treating subsidiaries
as separate profit centres. 'There is a tension between control and
delegation, and in France we arguably got it wrong,' he says.
Mr Birch also points out that it has made other investments in its retail
business that he believes worthwhile. One is the Pounds 500m spent since
flotation on upgrading its 660 branches. The other is the Pounds 285m
purchase of insurance company Scottish Mutual in 1991. This has created a
wholly owned life insurance arm through which Abbey sells its customers
savings products and policies linked to its endowment mortgages.
Yet such investments do not distinguish Abbey sharply from Halifax or other
societies. The area in which it has far more flexibility is its treasury.
Abbey's flotation gave it a large amount of capital, and allowed a wider use
of the money. Societies' treasuries are largely confined to raising funds
for mortgage lending. Abbey operates under the looser constraints of Bank of
England supervision.
Abbey's ratios of capital to assets are far stronger than other large UK
banks, which gives it an AA credit rating. This allows it to borrow and lend
on international capital markets at premium rates. It has gradually moved
from simply financing mortgage lending to leasing equipment in order to cut
its tax charge and investing in securities. It made Pounds 66m profit on
these activities in the first half of this year.
Yet there are two concerns. One is over the risks that Abbey may be running,
epitomised by the move into derivatives. Mr Harley insists that Abbey errs
on the side of caution. He cites its policy of ensuring that 90 per cent of
all leasing assets are underwritten by other banks. 'We deliberately take
smaller spreads than we might do because we are extremely careful. We are
very strict about risk,' he says.
The second problem is the logic of such activity. Mr Birch admits it is
largely opportunistic: Abbey has the capital and this is a convenient way of
using it. 'We think that one of the safest ways of using our capital for now
is to put it into treasury assets,' he says. Yet such corporate lending and
finance activities - no matter how profitable they are - do not fit easily
with its roots as a mortgage lender.
The obvious alternatives would be either to use its capital to acquire
another retail bank or mortgage lender, or to give it back to shareholders.
Mr Birch says Abbey has examined nearly 150 other companies since flotation
with a view to buying one, but has not yet found a good fit. He does not
favour handing back capital because Abbey wants to keep its credit rating,
and even raise it to the rarefied heights of AAA.
Abbey will soon face stronger pressure to make sense of a business that
stretches from making unsecured personal loans to trading interest rate
swaps. In July next year, five years after the flotation, the temporary ban
on the bank being taken over will lapse. It would be expensive to swallow
since its shares are currently worth about Pounds 5.2bn, but any substantial
error could now bear the penalty of increasing its vulnerability.
Mr Birch is sanguine about such a notion, arguing that no other financial
services company is in a position to take on Abbey. 'If anyone can really
extract increased value out of our business, then good luck to them,' he
says. But while it remains a hybrid, it will continue to provoke curiosity.
If Abbey's management cannot resolve the mystery, others may be tempted to
take up residence at 221b Baker Street.

The Turbulent Years My Life in Politics By Kenneth Baker Faber and Faber
Pounds 20, 498 pages
It is time to call a halt to political memoirs. This is not because of
indiscretions, of which political memoirs contain regrettably few. It is
because of excessive length, self-justification and a tendency to tedium.
When Lord Butler's The Art of the Possible was published in 1971, it ran to
274 pages. Lord Home, who had been prime minister, ran to 320 in 1976, but
the number of words to the page was smaller. Both books remain enjoyable and
informative to this day. Butler, in particular, was regarded as a model for
future writers. Lord Healey studied him closely, yet still came out with 607
pages in the Time of My Life. Lord Lawson set the record for a single volume
with his 1,119-page Memoirs of a Tory Radical earlier this year, yet at
least, like Healey, he had something to say.
Kenneth Baker's effort at 498 pages is the most egocentric book I have ever
read. One doubts if even the FT's computer could count the number of usages
of the first person singular. Even the title is a mix of the pretentious and
the banal. There have been many 'turbulent years' in British politics apart
from the 1980s, and so far as the 1980s were turbulent it was not entirely
because of Baker.
It is true that one may have underestimated his ambition to be party leader.
I had forgotten that when he became party chairman in 1989 Ladbrokes made
him the 2-1 favourite to succeed Margaret Thatcher, against 7-2 for John
Major and 4-1 for Sir Geoffrey Howe and Michael Heseltine; the political
journalist Peter Jenkins still had him as co-favourite with Heseltine almost
a year later.
It is also true that Baker has had a slightly unfortunate political career:
on the wrong side at the wrong time. He was essentially a 'Heathman'. When
Edward Heath lost the general election in February 1974, Baker felt obliged
to stay with him even though he was plainly itching to move on. He became
Heath's parliamentary private secretary, 'a rare example of a rising
politician joining a sinking ship', as he notes in his selective quotations.
The Heath attachment initially cost him dearly with Mrs Thatcher.
Advancement came slowly. It was not until 1985 that he entered the cabinet
as secretary of state for the environment. He took his place at the end of
the table, 'but with each reshuffle,' he adds, 'I moved closer to the
middle'.
It is true again that he has some achievements to his credit: the promotion
of information technology, for example. It is slightly less plausible, as he
suggests, that he was the main driving force behind the privatisation of
British Telecom and the water industry. In some areas where he was active he
left behind rather a mess: for instance, the abolition of the Greater London
Council without a successor governing body for the capital. On the community
charge or poll tax, he argues that all would have been well if his original
conditions, such as running it alongside rates, had been implemented.
He did much better at education. It is a strange fact that he was one of the
few secretaries of state in recent decades to look at the educational system
as a whole. Mrs Thatcher did not make much of a fist of it when she did the
job herself; she neglected it in her early years as prime minister. Baker at
least sought fundamental reforms and the raising of standards. He stayed for
three years (almost a Conservative record) before being moved to the party
chairmanship.
The trouble there was that while he was not a great friend of Mrs Thatcher,
he came to admire her and wanted her to stay. As a cabinet spending
minister, he claims that he was one of the few who consistently stood up to
her. This led to a certain mutual respect. By then, however, the prime
minister's days were beginning to be numbered and Baker was again riding the
wrong horse. He seems to have done this with some honour, at least according
to his memoirs: certainly he did not conspire against her, as the right-wing
of the party had thought he would.
After her fall, he became briefly home secretary, then turned down the Welsh
Office and left the government when Major won the 1992 election.
Yet the real sadness does not concern his career. It is that a man steeped
in English literature and English history should dash off such a memoir: not
much edited, not well-written and entirely without detachment. Kenneth
Baker, the former education secretary, should be ashamed of himself. One
hopes Lady Thatcher will do better.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Two of a kind: Regretful note over unity's path - Former
political leaders who advocate closer European integration / Helmut Schmidt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Schmidt, the Social Dem-ocrat chancellor of West Germany from 1974
to 1982, is wealthy, and worried.
Wealthy because several best-selling books on German and international
politics have brought a considerable income since he left office. His
latest, on the travails of unified Germany, has sold about 100,000 copies
since spring - but will earn him, he says, less than the originally expected
DM1m because recession has damped demand. He is using the funds to help set
up a foundation with other well-known Germans to help his country come to
terms with reunification - a phenomenon most Germans (he included) thought
they would never witness.
Worried, because so much in Germany seems to be going awry. He concedes
however, that he sometimes exaggerates his fears of German instability. In
his book, he describes how earlier this year he dreamt that the Nazis had
returned to power, closing the heavyweight newspaper, Die Zeit, of which he
is co-publisher.
'Maybe I shouldn't have written this,' admits Mr Schmidt, framed against
enyclopaedia-lined shelves in his Hamburg editorial office. 'I put it in to
show how deep my concern is. I don't really think the Nazis will take over.'
He says the break-up of the blocs of east and west has made not just Germany
but all Europe more brittle.
The new uncertainties have increased his support for European integration.
'I want Germany to be part of a greater Community. It is in Germany's
self-interest to bind itself in.' But they also appear to have made this
goal more difficult. The man who, along with French president Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, launched the European Monetary System in 1979 says last month's
forced widening of the system's fluctuation bands has 'decreased the
chances' of economic and monetary union by 2000.
'I am rather sceptical. None of the governments - neither London, nor Paris,
nor Bonn - understands the importance of monetary union.' Unless the D-Mark
is replaced by a single European currency, the German currency will one day
be 'overwhelmingly strong'. This would eventually make the Germans the
'masters' of the European Community - a position which, he says, would
rebound on Germany by making it vulnerable to 'coalitions' of European
states formed to curb its strength.
He expounds his well-known complaint that the Bundesbank is blocking
progress on Emu. 'Under monetary union, it would become just another
affiliate of the European central bank. I can understand why it dislikes
this.' He says, however, 'not only the Bundesbank is damaging the process.'
He terms a principal cause of last month's upset 'the unwillingness of the
French and German governments' to adjust the D-Mark/French franc EMS parity
earlier in the spring or summer.
A second effect of the uncertainties has been to increase Mr Schmidt's
popularity with the German electorate. Support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and the Social Democratic leadership - for which Mr Schmidt has no great
regard - is at a low ebb, increasing his appeal as an elder statesman.
Earlier this year, Mr Schmidt says he was 'besieged' with letters from
Germans entreating him to stand for the chancellorship. His secretaries sent
off replies, pointing out he is 74. The letters have now stopped.
Mr Schmidt, in poor health, knows he will not make a come-back. He says a
possible outcome of next year's general election will be a grand coalition
between Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the SPD.
Despite his health problems, his capacity for work remains formidable. It
took him five weeks to write his latest book, during a holiday last winter
on the Canary Islands. For relaxation, he organises meetings of former
international leaders, who exhibit collective anguish at their successors'
failure to solve world problems.
One of the biggest headaches is Germany. For all Mr Schmidt's fears of
eventual German dominance, his preoccupation at the moment is the lengthy
period Germany needs to cope with its challenges.
'In economic terms, unification will in the main be successful within 15 to
20 years. . . coming to terms with our national identity - trying to get the
same answer to the question 'What does it mean to be a German?' from a man
in Dresden and a man from Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) - will take longer, maybe
40 years.'
Although his notorious irascibility seems to have softened, he still
dispenses liberal doses of vitriol. Despite his support for monetary union,
he calls the Maastricht treaty 'monstrous'. 'There are far too many things
in one document. If you just wanted monetary union, you could have done it
in 10 or 12 pages.'
He says shortcomings in German politics are partly the result of television.
'On the news, politicians provide platitudes, not deep arguments. These are
politicians who could also have chosen a career presenting talk-shows.'
Relations between Mr Schmidt and his successor are icy: Mr Kohl, he says,
'has avoided asking for my counsel'. While Mr Kohl 'deluded himself' about
the realities of unification, Mr Schmidt says he would have raised taxes
immediately in 1990 to help finance the unification-induced rise in public
spending.
What verdict will history offer on Mr Kohl? Mr Schmidt's reply is balanced:
'He's been a successful politician so far. He grasped the chance (of unity)
offered by (Mr Mikhail) Gorbachev's domestic situation. After that, he's not
been convincing in the economic field. However, it is questionable whether
any one else at the top level of political class in either party would have
done better.'
This seems to express both his low opinion of contemporary German
politicians and a winsome disappointment that, when the bell of German unity
rang out three years ago, a certain Helmut Schmidt was not 10 years younger.
His disappointment seems unlikely to wither with age.

Sir, Joe Rogaly, in his article, 'Marx the musical' (September 7), doubted
whether any of his readers would be able to whistle the tune to the chorus
beginning 'Strong as the steel which we shape with precision'.
I cannot whistle but I suggest singing it (in the bath in my case) to the
tune Epiphany Hymn, used for 'Brightest and best of the sons of the

My wife would disagree.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Two of a kind: An architect of Maastricht edifice - Former
political leaders who advocate closer European integration / Giulio
Andreotti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is this the face that launched a thousand summit communiques? Mr Giulio
Andreotti, seven times Italian prime minister, sits behind his crowded desk
in an elegant, ochre-coloured building near the Pantheon in Rome. He looks
unusually crumpled.
Mr Andreotti, 74, who started his governmental career in 1947, is part of
the backbone of Italy's postwar history - a veteran of the Christian
Democrat party and of its domination of four decades of politics.
A principal architect of the Maastricht treaty, he ranks as one of the
foremost Italian proponents of closer European integration. Ironically for
Mr Andreotti, the Europeanism which he has so long fostered provides a
principal reason for the new impatience in Italy about the country's
near-endemic political corruption. As the Christian Democrats slide from
their former pivotal position amid a tide of scandal, history is starting to
catch up on him.
Murky allegations of political impropriety have dogged Mr Andreotti
throughout his long career. So far, they have always been unproven. This
time, however, the accusations have been mounted more energetically. He has
been forced to waive his parliamentary immunity to answer charges being
pressed by magistrates in Milan, Palermo and Rome. They relate to
allegations of consorting with the Mafia, being responsible for the death of
a journalist killed in Rome 14 years ago, and organising illicit political
financing. Mr Andreotti has protested his innocence.
A mantis-like figure, clad incongruously in a blue cardigan under his smart
suit, Mr Andreotti clasps a tube of nasal inhalant in his right hand, and
takes frequent telephone calls with his left. Testifying to his impeccable
Catholic credentials, his small office is crammed with crucifixes.
Speaking before the most serious charges were raised this summer, he termed
the claims 'perfidious manoeuvres' by political enemies.
Mr Andreotti says Italy's internal upheavals reflect the still greater
changes in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. The Christian
Democrats' previous supremacy, made possible by the postwar necessity of
countering the Italian communist party, was part of the former stability of
Europe's cold war structures. 'We are seeing the long-lasting waves caused
by the end of communism,' he says. 'The old political truths have vanished.'
The ending of east-west division and the reunification of Germany spawned
the Maastricht treaty, aimed at accelerating west European integration. But
the Maastricht programme itself has been blunted by two years of economic
and political shocks.
These shocks appear to make European union less feasible. Mr Andreotti
thinks they also make it more necessary. 'The fact that Europe is not yet
strong enough to resolve problems like Bosnia, and the necessity to have a
monetary order - these are reasons why we should multiply our efforts to
find solutions.'
Recalling the atmosphere in which the Treaty of Rome (which set up the
European Community) was negotiated in the 1950s, he says: 'We who are old
can remember the suspicion towards Europe at the beginning. People said it
(the EC) was not possible. But Europe has worked well.'
He puts forward a particular reason for pressing on with the Maastricht
treaty: to accommodate a larger Germany within a united Europe. In 1984, he
won notoriety in Germany by saying he would prefer the Germans to remain
divided. Now that the nation is reunited, he believes Germany will
inevitably reshape its European policies in coming years.
Asked whether the next chancellor will be less interested in European union
than Mr Helmut Kohl, he replies: 'Perhaps not the next one, but his
successor.'
Germany can no longer be relied upon to continue its postwar policy of
balancing obligations and responsibilities to east and west, he says. He
evokes the names of Willy Brandt, the former West German chancellor, and
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former foreign minister.
'Perhaps Germany will no longer be the Germany of Kohl nor of Genscher nor
of Willy Brandt. We don't know what sort of Germany it will be. It could be
a strong Germany, in an isolated and fractured Europe.'
Fears that Germany's western ties will be loosened explain why Mr Andreotti
has been in the vanguard of efforts to harness Germany and its D-Mark
through economic and monetary union. He played an important part in hatching
the Emu plan agreed at Maastricht in December 1991. In a discreet
eve-of-summit dinner with President Francois Mitterrand in a hotel in the
Dutch city, Mr Andreotti formulated the timetable for introducing Emu by
1997 or 1999.
'This preparation was the result of (our) personal contacts, as well as work
by our officials,' he emphasises. 'It wasn't improvised.'
Mr Andreotti parries the suggestion that Germany's post-unification
difficulties make this timetable unachievable. 'I don't think we can now
announce the defeat of Maastricht.'
On the other hand, even before last month's monetary upheavals, he was
resigned to the likelihood that his cherished plan would be delayed. 'Kohl's
fundamental idea is tha monetary union should not go forward without
political union. If for domestic (German) reasons, such as the additional
costs of unification, we should now have a less rapid timetable, that could
be agreed. Fundamentally there is no alternative but to make great efforts
to realise, at the least, the spirit of Maastricht.'
Accomplishing the spirit of Maastricht, rather than implementing its
content, may not amount to much.
But as Mr Andreotti contemplates his crucifixes, reviews his options, and
faces his enemies, it represents one last straw to clutch.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Warnings suppressed by the
Politically Correct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THEO THEOCHARIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Bronwen Maddox's article, 'Greens' bogus science' (September 6), she
correctly remarks that the distortion of the scientific method by certain
green organisations 'destroys any notion of proof' and can therefore 'cause
legal mayhem'.
This is merely a special case of a deeper and wider malaise. Six years ago,
also in connection with the perennial public mistrust of science, a
colleague and I published an article entitled 'Where Science Has Gone Wrong'
in Nature (Vol. 329, pp. 595-8, October 15 1987), in which we explained that
the currently taught philosophies of science are epistemologically flawed
and socially dangerous. These philosophies reject completely the concepts of
scientific objectivity, proof, truth and certainty. These philosophies have
therefore been embraced with enthusiasm by all Politically Correct movements
which think that objectivity, etc, is the invention of first world science
so that its multinational companies can exploit and oppress the Third World,
the minorities and the environment.
Regrettably, our 1987 warnings were suppressed by the Politically Correct,
and overlooked by the Politically InCorrect, to the further detriment of
both science and society. I hope that now they will be heeded.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Privatisation has made little
difference to BT performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell's article on privatisation and prices ('On the
bandwagon', August 27), raised important questions, but I am afraid fell
into some usual traps. There are no absolute yardsticks in the utility price
game. Even foreign comparisons are meretricious because of the near
impossibility of comparing like for like and the constant shifts in exchange
rates.
He also failed to recognise the profound effect of variables specific to the
industries. In the case of British Telecommunications the telephone system
grew by a factor of three between 1970 and 1992; and usage grew even more.
By privatisation, unit costs were steadily dropping; and the sheer volume of
revenue was so great and it was growing so fast that the price increases
needed to maintain profitability were bound progressively to drop. The
enduring economic boom of the 1980s intensified the effect.
History does not begin at privatisation. The useful analysis is over
significant periods before and after privatisation; using variables which
have an independent meaning. Inflation raised prices generally by a factor
of 7.6 over the 22 years 1970-1992. Those of BT rose only by a factor of 4.3
over the same period. They have fallen steadily below general inflation ever
since 1982. Privatisation in 1984 had no perceptible effect on this trend -
up or down.
BT's real output per head of staff, measured at constant BT prices, has been
rising remarkably consistently at 7.5 per cent ever since 1970. The only
significant setback to this trend was immediately after privatisation. It
has been retrieved by the recent staff reductions. There is a similar
pattern in improvement in network service; 3.4 per cent of local calls
failed in 1971, but by 1992 the percentage had been reduced to 0.2 per cent.
Again, there was a setback after privatisation, but it has now been
retrieved.
The true lesson in BT's case once trends are measured over time seems to be
that privatisation has made little difference. It would be interesting to
see a similar analysis for the other industries.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Silliness' of radiation proviso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs ANN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On reading that Nuclear Electric had applied for authorisation for
radioactive discharges from Sizewell B ('Talks on Sizewell application',
August 13) and being worried for my children's future, I wrote to the
National Radiological Protection Board for reassurance that the lower annual
radiation dose limits which it had recommended in 1987 would be enforced.
Its reply advised me that its role is 'advisory rather than regulatory' and
that it is up to the 'authorising departments' and the Health and Safety
Executive to ensure discharges and doses are 'within the appropriate
limits'. The NRPB also enclosed a memorandum on potential Thorp discharges.
Reading this lengthy document, I came to this statement: 'It was assumed
that infants and children spend 90 per cent of the time indoors.' I read no
further.
To me, the silliness of this statement rivalled that of the Health and
Safety Executive/UK Atomic Energy Authority's in their publication of
January 1989, The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations (HMSO
Pounds 12). This told us that if there was 'a Chernobyl-scale accident' in
this country, 'no one will die,' people would merely 'suffer some degree of
life-shortening.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Science a bleak career prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am able to manage but one wry smile at the pious hope for the future
of chemistry expressed by John Cox, director general of the Chemical
Industries Association (Letters, August 28/29). Like the rest of us science
graduates, one must suspect that most directors of the CIA are there because
they, too, were not really wanted by their industrial employers.
The fact is that many managers with science degrees from such UK companies
as ICI, BP or Shell have had their careers curtailed unexpectedly early over
the last 20 years (starting about 1973) and have been encouraged to work
overseas for foreign competitors.
Perhaps Mr Cox would tell us how many employees with science degrees in the
British chemical industry have been retired early or made redundant since
1973. One would wager it to be a significant proportion of total UK private
industry science manpower]
It is hardly surprising that the children of the scientifically qualified do
not see much future in science and seek greener pastures elsewhere, even if
we might all agree (but only in theory) that it is impossible to run a
country as technically sophisticated as the UK without managers strongly
grounded in science.
Surely the message of the last 20 years is that jobs in banking, foreign
exchange, investment management, property development, restaurants and
politics (anything but science-based industry) pay much better than any job
in science: Is Mr Cox surprised at our intelligent children noticing?

FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Firm grip of Hollywood - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS and STEVEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRM (15) Sydney Pollack
ANCHORESS (12) Chris Newby
A PLACE IN THE WORLD (12) Adolpho Aristarain
THE LIE (15) Francois Margolin
WHEN a black street urchin does a series of impromptu somersaults on a
sidewalk in Memphis, Tennessee, the hero (Tom Cruise) does a matching
somersault alongside him. This majestically daft moment comes in The Firm, a
tale of corrupt lawyers who do laundry work - and we are not talking of
shirts and underclothes - for the Mafia. Master Cruise plays the initially
bushy-tailed, obedient trainee who finally exposes the rotters after 2 1/2
hours, several murders, his wife's walkout and enough chases to sate you for
the year.
We are not spoiling surprises for you. In this airport bestseller turned
multi-million-dollar movie, who could doubt that Cruise will triumph; any
more than we doubted that he would jump up and pour moral cleansing fluid
all over Colonel Jack Nicholson at the end of A Few Good Men. Cruise's role
in modern Hollywood is that of a jack-in-the-box Mr Clean. When Cruise
somersaults in a street during a film, it is not for the hell of it. He is
acting out his own coat-of-arms as a modern superstar: a rampant
boy-reformer leaping over the corruptly couchant body of
corporate/military/legal/political America.
The Firm is ludicrous but enjoyable. We scent 150 minutes of Hollywood
delirium from the first thumping chords of Dave Grusin's piano score over a
lateral tracking-shot along Memphis' skyscraper-lined river. The film
already plays like The French Connection and we have not yet had the
credits. After that, as directed by a peak-form Sydney Pollack, it never
stops or slows. Gene Hackman is the Chief Baddie in the firm Cruise joins
after it wins the bidding war for his Ivy League talents and Hackman's
high-class slime provides the trickle-down histrionics allowing supporting
players to snarl and emote with elan.
We have Hal Holbrook as the firm's white-haired patriarch; Ed Harris as the
no-haired FBI sleuth, his pate as dazzling as an interrogation lamp; Jeanne
(Basic Instinct) Tripplehorn as Cruise's pretty redhaired wife; and Holly
Hunter as the friendly detective-agency moll with the rinky-dink voice and
the explosion of platinum curls. As is appropriate in a story of the good
and evil things that issue from people's heads, in this film by their hair
ye shall know them.
What pleases is the movie's impudent predictability. The 'surprises' are
ripples in a sea of see-it-coming. How will Cruise escape from an office
full of men who want to kill him? (We just know that he will). What plot
twist will return Miss Tripplehorn to Cruise's arms? (We just know that
something will). As for the final ingenious gambit by which Cruise gets the
baddies without compromising his code of honour as a lawyer, that could be
second-guessed by mentally riffling through gangster history.
The Anchoress is the kind of film the British Film Institute Production
Board gives us when it fears we are consuming too much junk food like The
Firm. In 14th century England an illiterate peasant girl (Natalie Morse)
declines to marry the local reeve and attracts the attention of the village
priest, talent-scouting for anchorites. Soon she has been immured for life
inside a church wall, there to commune with God and to eat the scraps of
food pushed through a hole by her understandably distressed mother.
The film looks like Tarkovsky and plays like Monty Python. Director Chris
Newby has an eye touched by divine grace. Marvel at those filter-darkened
skyscapes, those rhymings of shimmering corn with fluttering birdwing or
falling hair, those elastic contrasts between long shot (silhouette
procession on skyline) and close-ups (giant locust, giant eye).
But Newby's ear is a different matter. Or perhaps the script by Judith
Stanley-Smith and and Christine Watkins was delivered as a fait accompli and
he had no veto over lines like 'Don't you go 'anging around those back
fields, my girl'.
'The film is about a poetic eye at work in a barbaric landscape,' Newby has
said of his first feature film. The poetic eye in this instance is Newby's.
The barbaric landscape is the dramatic material on which he is required to
exercise that eye.
BEING 12 is tough enough without having to deal with the added distraction
of living in a police state, especially when your parents are radical
agitators who have been banished to the wilderness, writes Steven Amidon.
Writer / director Adolpho Aristarain's A Place in the World is one of a host
of Argentinian films dealing with that country's troubled recent past,
though this one grounds itself more firmly in reality than most by employing
a heartfelt coming of age story to make its political points.
Ernesto (Gaston Batyi) is a serious child whose parents are trying to fight
the good fight in the backwater to which they have been exiled. Aristarain's
plot concerns a hazily defined struggle between farmers and a hydroelectric
company which quickly becomes a familiar tale of greedy bastards versus
salt-of-the-earth folk.
The film distinguishes itself in its meticulous attention to character, not
just Ernesto's proud family but also a troubled nun and a cynical geologist.
And while the story's leisurely pace and occasional moral worthiness may
alienate some, it remains one of the more accessible of recent portraits of
South America.
The deception at the heart of The Lie is a deadly one. Francois Margolin's
first feature concerns a seemingly happy French couple whose life is torn
apart by the HIV virus. Emma (Nathalie Baye) appears to have everything - a
good job as an arts writer, a cute eight-year-old son and a dashing, foreign
correspondent partner. When she suspects that she is pregnant she goes for a
test, only to learn she is HIV positive. Knowing that she could only have
contracted the virus from her partner, her horror turns to anger as she
investigates his life, learning that he has been doing more corresponding
than his job requires, particularly at gay bars.
Heterosexual Aids is a bold, timely subject, yet just because Margolin tries
to tackle big topics does not mean he gets a grip on them. Having assembled
a promising group of characters and some combustible dramatic material, he
fails to set it all ablaze. In the end, it is hard to tell whether this is a
cautionary tale or simply melodrama hiding behind immunology. In spite of
some perceptive moments and a steady performance by Baye, The Lie poses more
questions than it has the power to resolve, and introduces more dilemmas
than it has the sagacity to define.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Late premiere - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE American writer Jane Bowles (1917-73) wrote just one play, and here it
is, receiving its British premiere, 40 years on.
In the Summer House, colourfully located in southern California, belongs to
the Tennessee Williams tradition of psychological-cum-social drama - a
tradition descending from Ibsen, Chekhov, and Freud. Mainly about the
interior lives of women, it not infrequently recalls the darker paths
investigated in the same postwar period by Martha Graham's psychoanalytic
dance-dramas. We see no less than three mother-daughter pairings, each one
marked by selfishness, intimacy, vulnerability, insensitivity, and
manipulation.
The most 'dramatic' event is a death offstage, and it is Bowles's most
audacious touch to make this occur during Act One. Was it an accident? It is
officially accepted as such by all. But we are never sure; and we keep
watching how the survivors react, months after. Yet Bowles is boldest of all
in not making this death central to anyone's life. This is not a Patricia
Highsmith thriller, where complicity and guilt colour everything. The death
simply intensifies psychological threads that already run through the
characters.
The plot centres on the relationship between the passive, repressed Molly
(in her late teens) and her elegant, controlling mother Gertrude. The summer
house, in Gertrude's garden, is where Molly lingers sullenly: a womb-like
symbol for the prepubescent state of protected dependence which Molly clings
to. It is Molly who may or may not be responsible for the death of a sibling
rival, Vivian Constable. During Act One, both Molly and Gertrude get
married, but, whereas Molly does not want to leave home, her mother is ready
to break from her daughter.
The thrill of Act Two lies in our discovery that, 10 months later, neither
mother nor daughter has really accepted the new men in their lives. Molly
craves her mother and former home; Gertrude uses her daughter in her effort
to flee from wedded non-bliss. All of which is complicated by the eerie
presence of Mrs Constable, mother of the late Vivian. It is she who changes
most during the play - from nervous fusspot, following awkwardly in her
daughter's shadow, to half-crazed drunk, realising in her cups that her
daughter and husband never loved her, tending some of Molly's filial scars.
Derek Goldby's direction of this play at the Lyric Hammersmith has complete
fluency and - thanks also to Hayden Griffin's designs - Californian
atmosphere. Small roles are played with force, wit, and conviction. Only in
Tom Bowles's playing of Molly's husband is there any of the usual British
discomfort with American accents. Gertrude, Molly, Mrs Constable and Vivian
Constable, four tricky roles, are acted by Rosemary Harris, Sophie
Thursfield, Dana Ivey and Robin Weaver with assurance, skill, but not enough
danger. Especially from Harris, who is so nearly a great actress, I wanted
less charm, more edge.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Safe pleasures by the lake - Lucerne Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER else the Lucerne Festival may stand for, it does not stand for
controversy. Lucerne, like Switzerland, is comfortable and consensus-minded:
it could not be controversial if it tried. By avoiding staged opera, it
remains above the political conflicts that regularly beset other European
music festivals. By relying on a core of wealthy Swiss patrons, it has
steered clear of economic uncertainty. It is a safe, low-risk formula which
promises continuity, smooth organisation and emotional reserve.
Within these limits, Lucerne has something to offer. First, there is the
setting: where else can you attend an Alfred Brendel performance in the
morning, have lunch on a paddle steamer with views of William Tell-country
drifting by, explore an Alpine peak by train and return to hear the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra? Even without the lakeside scenery, Lucerne offers a
chance to catch most of the big-name orchestras, conductors and soloists in
the space of three weeks. Anyone wary of musical indigestion can always stay
at home and select some of the live concert relays on Swiss radio. But you
still end up wishing you were there - as I did when I listened to the
broadcast of Mikhail Pletnev's fabulous Russian National Orchestra in
Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3, and a Pathetique of blazing integrity from Abbado
and the Berlin Philharmonic.
Programmes have become spicier since Matthias Bamert took over as artistic
director - slipping a new work by Heinz Holliger alongside Radu Lupu's
performance of the Schumann concerto, or pairing Igor Oistrakh's Vivaldi
with an Edison Denisov premiere. This year's theme was Russia. Lucerne must
be the only large festival to have accepted the obvious pairing of
Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov (respectively the 100th and 50th anniversary of
their deaths); but the chance to explore the lesser-known chamber-recital
repertoire was passed up in favour of another run through familiar
blockbusters.
Where the theme did pay dividends was the exposure it gave to Alfred
Schnittke, Lucerne's first-ever composer-in-residence. No new work was on
offer, apparently because of ill health and the symphonies were conspicuous
by their absence. But 14 Schnittke works were performed, more than any other
composer.
The Lucerne programmes demonstrated just how variable Schnittke's prolific
output can be. Worst of all was the Second Piano Sonata (1990), a catalogue
of meandering ideas, thumping clusters and splashy pianistic cliches, which
suggested a composer ill-at-ease with the keyboard. Schnittke's wife Irina
certainly did nothing to soften the work's embarrassing tawdriness. By
contrast, the Second String Quartet (1980), played by Sweden's excellent
Tale Quartet in the same programme, came across as one of Schnittke's most
elegiac and substantial works. Composed in response to the sudden death of a
close friend, it owes some of its tonal language to old Russian religious
motifs - but the influence is fully absorbed, the musical argument
seamlessly unfolded through hiatus and repose, the tragic mood captured by
quiet, meditative dissonances.
This is Schnittke at his most serious and personal, expressing intense
emotions through music of astonishing harmonic freedom. But where he
acknowledges his influences more obviously, I find myself less easily
persuaded. At first, his stylistic many-sidedness is hard to resist because
of its sheer zest and playful imagination; with greater familiarity, it
starts to sound trivial and banal.
In the Concerto Grosso No. 3 for two violins and chamber orchestra (1985),
vividly brought to life by Daniel Hope and Erik Houston with the Lithuanian
Chamber Orchestra, Schnittke makes a convincing case simply through the
technical dexterity with which he refracts the sound and style of a baroque
concerto. There is a genuine synthesis of contrasting styles, filtered
through Schnittke's own personality. The score also thrives on the brilliant
conversational working of two virtuoso solo parts. But in less substantial
works such as the melancholy Concerto No. 3 for violin and chamber orchestra
(played by Bettina Boller and the Basle Radio Symphony Orchestra) or the
over-extended Piano Concerto (Petras Geniusas), both dating from the late
1970s, the stylistic picking-around is at best predictable, at worst crude.
Like most of the festival's small-scale events, the Schnittke concerts took
place in one or other of Lucerne's churches and suburban halls, which offer
atmosphere but poor acoustics (and the occasional overlay of bell-chiming).
Lucerne needs not just a replacement for its cramped concert hall, but a
decent recital hall. So the prospect of a SFr194m (Pounds 88m) lakeside
complex, to be opened in time for the festival's 60th anniversary in 1998,
is doubly welcome.

We are assured that ITV's substitute for 'This Week', the half-hour current
affairs programme The Big Story, which is launched today at 7.30, will be
hard hitting, popular, and 'searching out the often shocking truth hidden
behind the headlines'.
Thanks to the character of Victor Meldrew, 'One Foot In The Grave' has
attracted more attention than the other oldie comedy, Waiting For God, which
begins a fresh batch on BBC1. Yet Waiting For God seems to me the better
series, particularly strong on dialogue and in the superb acting partnership
between Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden (8.30).
Crimewatch UK is back with a mouth-watering menu. There's a reconstruction
of the last day in the lives of a 64-year-old man and his 67-year-old wife
who were shot dead in their Welsh farmhouse (sounds super]) a young woman
telling us all about how she was raped (yummy yummy]) and reports of a woman
being spied on as she changed after a game of squash (cor]). Drooling over
this is quite OK because it's all in the name of crime prevention (9.30).

FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Homegrown stars - Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE not many visiting international orchestras available to the Proms
this year, but that matters less than it did. British audiences are being
persuaded to accept that homegrown celebrity orchestras are in season from
July to September as well.
The reception given to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra clearly
accorded it celebrity status, which it has won in its own way. Whereas the
top Austrian and German orchestras want to play the music for which
centuries of tradition have made them the world's finest exponents, British
orchestras claim no exclusive territory. Their specialism is diversity
itself - the music of all periods, of all nations.
Arriving a week after the Leipzig Gewandhaus, Simon Rattle and the CBSO
chose their ground well. In a straight fight over the German classics they
would surely lose a bloody battle. The Birmingham orchestra's sound is not
as refined, its ear for balance nothing like as acute. But its two concerts
had impact, as a result of the vivid clash of musical styles.
On Monday, BBC2 viewers probably tuned in to see Maurizio Pollini play
Mozart's C Minor Piano Concerto, K491. It would be interesting to know how
the performance came across on television. In the hall, Pollini played
inwardly, often not trying to dominate, sometimes unhelpfully obscured. One
sensed that his classical integrity was being questioned by a subversive
orchestra, always trying to draw from him statements more passionate than he
wanted to give.
The orchestral sound there lacked bite; surprising, when the musicians sank
their teeth so incisively into Schoenberg's First Chamber Symphony and
Stravinsky's Pulcinella. Rattle took the Stravinsky rather doggedly, but
brought it closer to the vulgar Neapolitan street theatre than I have heard
before. Horns that swaggered, lumbering basses, a trombone that blew the
rudest of raspberries - every instrument played a new character in the
commedia dell'arte.
The Tuesday concert journeyed to Scandinavia, but with a couple of
surprising detours, perhaps to lighten the mood. Rattle's performance of the
Sibelius Violin Concerto with Ida Haendel was gloomy, on the heavy side. His
account of Nielsen's Fifth Symphony was more impressive by far, summoning
from its depths climaxes of formidable power.
There was no logic to including Debussy's Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune
and the short, pithy, sardonic Ciaconna sinfonica by Berthold Goldschmidt;
only a desire for adventure. The ominous goose-step that stamps across the
latter leaves little doubt as to its date of composition: the 1930s, when
its Jewish composer was forced to leave his native Germany. Growing interest
in the music of that era means we shall soon be hearing more of Goldschmidt
(90 this year, but still sprightly). Typical of Rattle to bring him to the
Proms.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Technology: Small wonders, big realities - A look at the
revolutionary scientific and industrial possibilities of micromachining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a lightbulb that is thinner than a human hair or a weighing scale so
sensitive it can weigh a single cell. Thanks to a marriage of scientific
ingenuity with techniques developed for the microchip industry, these and
other small wonders are becoming reality.
Micromachining, an industry which only started 10 years ago, is growing
quickly. The tiny devices - often smaller than the dot on an 'i' - can be
used in all sorts of applications.
The idea of micromachines conjures up images of minute motors and pumps, but
practical versions are years from reality. Many of the applications are
medical, such as blood pressure monitors which fit on the end of catheters,
or tiny scissors for microsurgery.
Researchers predict that an implantable device which senses blood sugar
levels and dispenses insulin will soon be developed for the treatment of
diabetes.
Despite their intricacy, micromachines can be produced at low cost in large
numbers. This is because much of the expense is taken up with design. So the
more that are manufactured, the cheaper they are.
The fabricating techniques developed for the microelectronics industry have
given the makers of micromachines a head start. 'If the integrated circuit
industry wasn't there, there is a whole lot of equipment that would have had
to be designed that would have cost millions,' says Gordon Guild, president
of the Micromachining Technology Centre, set up to develop and market
devices pioneered at Simon Fraser University's Institute for Micromachining
and Microfabrication Research in Vancouver, Canada.
The two-micron (millionth of a metre) technology formerly used to
manufacture microchips is more than adequate for micromachining. (The latest
microprocessor chips use resolutions of less than one micron.) Thus research
facilities have picked up very workable equipment cheaply.
To date, the commercial applications of micromachining, including pressure
sensors and other comparatively simple measuring devices, have been more
prosaic than the visions of some researchers.
Many potential applications are not 'machines' at all but small-scale
structures such as membranes, valves or micro-lenses made with
micromachining techniques.
By far the largest existing market for micromachines is the automotive
industry. This includes a wide range of functions from the accelerometers
which trigger airbags to the pressure sensors in emission control systems.
Micromachining is seen as a critical future technology for vehicle makers,
says Jay Jackson, a vice-president at Ford Microelectronics.
Ford has demonstrated its commitment by moving a large number of engineers
to Colorado Springs, where it has set up a micromachining centre. The fuel
injector nozzles Ford recently started manufacturing there illustrate some
of the advantages of micromachining.
Nozzles made by other manufacturers use an electronic discharge technique to
drill small holes in stainless steel. The holes Ford is producing in silicon
with micromachining techniques are very uniform, which means the company's
fuel injectors are more precise, says Jackson.
The automotive industry will continue to use increasing numbers of
microsensors for engine control, transmission control and features such as
active suspension. But the next generation of micromachines will
revolutionise other areas.
Many of these devices will start to see the commercial exploitation of
surface micromachining (see story below). Often they will be smaller
versions of existing devices. For example, some breath alcohol sensors
require that an alcohol-sensitive film be heated up to 400'C, for a chemical
reaction to occur.
With micromachining, the surface on which the film sits and the heating
apparatus can be made very small, but the chemical process and operation of
the device remain fundamentally the same.
The chemical industry is interested in micromachining to produce process
control devices such as gas flow sensors and gas composition sensors,
scattered in large numbers throughout a chemical plant.
The medical possibilities have attracted the interest of pharmaceutical
companies, which have visions of specialised drug delivery systems and
entirely new treatments. Ash Parameswaran a professor at the Vancouver
institute has developed a weighing device with a tiny arm, so sensitive it
will measure the mass of a single cell. He has also developed a light
element a few microns across, now being made in the US.
Arrays of everything from micro-pumps to micro-sensors are expected to be
common applications of the technology. One device, developed by Texas
Instruments, uses more than 300,000 rotatable aluminium micro-mirrors to
produce a bright colour-video display.
Parameswaran says no other technology has grown so quickly. In the early
1980s micromachining did not exist; by the end of the decade, up to 700
papers were being presented at each conference on the topic.

Despite similarities, the technology used to make the commercial devices now
on the market - bulk micromachining - is not, strictly speaking, the same as
that used for integrated circuits.
Small-scale masking and etching are used to produce both, but bulk
micromachining typically creates much deeper holes in the silicon. Precise
shapes can be made, thanks to the properties of crystalline silicon.
Specially formulated etchants will move straight down, but not sideways,
through a layer in the crystal lattice.
This also makes it possible to etch under a layer of silicon, freeing the
tiny weights and levers used in devices such as accelerometers.
If bulk micromachining is like sculpting, the more advanced technique of
surface micromachining is like painting - layers of material are built up
and etched away on top of a layer of silicon, until the desired
three-dimensional objects are formed.
Randy Frank, technical marketing manager at Motorola's semiconductor
products division, says that compared with bulk micromachining, surface
micromachining is more similar to the standard technology used to make most
microchips.
It should allow the same bit of silicon to hold the sensor or actuator and
the control circuitry, enhancing reliability and cutting the cost of
devices.
Much of this is still at the laboratory stage. Commercial devices using
surface micromachining are starting to appear, but Frank says sensors and
controls on the same chip will not be made in large numbers until the end of
the decade.
Problems include the heat or etchants used for processing the sensor ruining
the integrated circuit, or vice versa. Also, the layers of material used in
micromachining are much thicker than those used for microcircuitry.
Thickness is important for microgears and motors - the thicker they are, the
more torque is possible. A technique developed in Germany called Liga
(lithography, electroforming and moulding) allows shapes like gears to be
made thicker than is possible with surface micromachining.
Liga uses high energy X-rays which penetrate hundreds of microns into a
layer of polymer. The polymer is then etched away and used as a mould for a
metal such as nickel. The use of metals rather than silicon to achieve
greater strength or durability is also being applied to surface
micromachining.
A set of techniques, developed in Japan, uses micro drills, spark erosion
devices and tiny diamond lathes, which require each device to be made
individually.
But Linton Salmon, director of the solid state and microstructure programme
at the US National Science Foundation, says that by making single devices
the Japanese will lose the economies of scale which come with making
hundreds of devices on a silicon wafer.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Technology: Just the ticket for parking offenders - Computer
system to ease congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM CLAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost unnoticed, a roadside revolution is taking place in London as new
computer systems are installed to simplify parking control and to clamp down
on offenders. With parking a growing worldwide problem, the developments in
the capital are attracting keen interest.
Over the years, an awkward system has developed in London. In areas of
'controlled' parking - yellow lines, meter bays, pay-and-display and
residents' areas - the police used to authorise all clamping and towing
away.
In June, this authority was handed over to traffic wardens, who always
presided over yellow-line infringements. In addition, parking attendants -
under the control of the local authorities - cover infringements in meter
bays, pay-and-display parking and residents' areas.
By the middle of next year this will change further. Following the 1991 Road
Traffic Act most parking control in the capital will be handed over to the
33 local authorities including the City of London.
The impact of the change on each local authority depends on the amount of
controlled parking. Wandsworth, with very little, has implemented most of
the changes on a trial basis.
Westminster, which has just over eight square miles of controlled parking,
is taking the opportunity to introduce an ambitious system with new
computers and mobile data networks. Despite differences in scale, the way
the parking attendants work will be the same throughout London.
Westminster is about to sign a contract for 200 hand-held computers for its
attendants. At present, they write each ticket by hand, put one copy on the
vehicle and, at the end of their shift, hand in a duplicate. The information
is typed into a computer.
With the new system, attendants will type details of the vehicle into their
hand-held computers. Printers attached to them will produce the ticket and,
at the end of the shift, the data will be dumped into a central system.
Another important development is the introduction of a mobile data network
so that the attendants' computers can send information instantly about a car
or van which, under their new powers, they want clamped or towed away. The
message can indicate the degree of urgency, especially where the vehicle is
causing an obstruction.
The network can also deliver information to an attendant's computer so that
the typing in of a registration number could warn that the vehicle's owner
has not paid previous fines. The attendant could then decide that clamping
was suitable to ensure payment and open the way for discussions about the
previous fines.
The heart of Westminster's approach is a central computer system, replacing
the separate ones used for handling parking attendants' data, ticket
processing, permits and meter maintenance. The system will provide a
prioritised list to the despatchers who send out the clamping vans and
removal trucks. In the cabs, details of offending vehicles will appear on
screens and crews will be able to send back progress reports.
Car pounds will also be linked to the system along with a telephone help
desk for distraught motorists and those seeking advice on parking.
To help motorists, there will be a 'super-system' covering the capital. The
Parking Committee for London, set up under the 1991 Act, will provide a
number which motorists can ring when their cars have been clamped or towed
away, regardless of which borough they are in. For this, it will have a
computer system constantly updated by the 33 local systems. It will also be
able to send data back to them to ensure, for example, that databases of
persistent offenders are kept up to date.
The contract for this system is due to be signed in November. Bidders are
likely to include groups like EDS Scicon of the US, which has experience of
similar operations in Chicago and Spain, and smaller companies like Compex
Parking Services of the UK.
For drivers who feel they are suffering from high-tech harassment, the
Parking Committee will run an adjudication service. So they should at least
find it easy to complain.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): Chilling commercials do not
help - Tourist industry now offers too many attractions for too few tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On September 22 a small, narrow-gauge steam train will make its last journey
around Lord O'Neill's Shane's Castle estate on the shores of Lough Neagh in
County Antrim.
Lord O'Neill, who installed the railway in 1971, says that with only 30,000
passengers each year, it did not pay its way. Northern Ireland now offers
too many attractions for too few tourists. 'Unless peace breaks out, some of
them won't be sustainable. We need to watch the total number and we have to
go for quality, not quantity.'
He is himself a former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
(NITB). His remarks strike a chord in the industry. Promotors and
proprietors bemoan Ulster's wettest, most sunless summer since reliable
records began. Thousands of what would have been the industry's home-trade
visitors scrambled for last-minute bookings to seek sunshine elsewhere.
Has the province, in a frenetic burst of development activity
enthusiastically supported by the NITB and funded with big subventions from
both the EC and the International Fund for Ireland, over-catered for the
level of tourism it can reasonably expect while its external image remains
so poor?
Presenting his 1992 annual report, Mr Hugh O'Neill, the present NITB
chairman, unabashedly announced that the board was currently involved in the
development of some 350 projects. The NITB has just published a brochure on
no fewer than 24 developments either just opened or to open by the end of
this month.
They include multi-million pound 'star attractions' such as the Pounds 4.5m
interpretative centre at Navan Fort outside Armagh - the Emain Macha of
Gaelic legend, seat of the ancient kings of Ulster. Then there is the Tower
museum in Londonderry, which capitalises on the rich history of western
Europe's last fortress city with ancient walls intact. A big 'discovery
centre' on Lough Neagh will be a success if it does not drive the ambient
bird life away.
Carrickfergus, on the Antrim coast, hid its magnificent Norman castle behind
a screen of enormous oil tanks and paid scant regard to its archaeological
heritage - until recently. In July this year the innovative Pounds 2.5m
'Knightride' monorail opened, carrying visitors through tableaux of
Carrickfergus's history from 531 AD almost to the present day.
Northern Ireland's 26 district councils, deprived of most of the powers
enjoyed by their mainland counterparts, have clamoured for grants to
exercise their muscle in one of the very few sectors where their writ can
run. The upshot is that while the province is not exactly rich in 'heritage
and interpretive' centres, provision is unbalanced and some long-standing
Ulster assets are ignored. (It remains very difficult, for example, to find
a public slipway giving a boat owner easy access to the tidal waters of the
18-mile long Strangford Lough.)
With an 80 per cent increase in inquiries this year compared with 1992, the
NITB is forecasting an all-time high of 1.5m visitors against last year's
total of 1.255m - which itself was a 6 per cent increase on 1991. These
figures include business visitors and what the trade calls VFR (visiting
friends and relatives) traffic, with the number of purely discretionary
'real' holidaymakers in the minority. In this category, visitors from both
Britain and the Republic declined by 7 and 17 per cent respectively last
year.
Ulster's tourist trade pales into insignificance beside that of competing
regions. Its estimated tourism earnings of Pounds 162m last year accounted
for just 2 per cent of Ulster's gdp. Scotland's accounted for 9 per cent of
regional gdp against an estimated overall figure of 5 per cent for Great
Britain. The Republic's tourist industry contributed 7 per cent to the Irish
gdp.
If its image were not such a depressant, on a pro rata basis Northern
Ireland could reasonably expect more than 5m visitors a year. If there is
little recovery in the numbers of visitors originating from or passing
through the Republic of Ireland this year, the Northern Ireland Office
should take some of the blame. In an astonishing display of what some
tourist interests call witlessness, the Northern Ireland Office began
running a series of chilling commercials on Ulster Television, featuring
make-believe terrorist murders (ironically, filmed in Scotland), in the hope
of persuading more Ulster people to become police informers by means of the
confidential recording telephones. 'Don't suffer it. Change it', ran the
punchline.
Transmission began just as the NITB launched its most ambitious high-season
TV advertising campaign yet: two handsome commercials transmitted throughout
the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. But the terrorism commercials -
designed purely for Northern Ireland consumption - would have been received
and viewed by millions in the larger, more populous part of the Republic.
The deterrent effect on intending visitors can only be imagined.
It may not have been quite as bad, however, as the effect of this year's
appalling summer. 'Trade from the Republic is particularly susceptible to
the weather. We have reports of people booking and not showing up, or
leaving early because of constant rain,' says Hugh O'Neill.
As Mr Geoff Hill, travel editor of the Newsletter, a Northern Ireland
morning paper, wrote recently: 'Booking an Ulster summer holiday has always
been like looking for a job in the tourist board. 'Wimps' need not apply.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): Convinced that the border
will be irrelevant / Profile of John Hume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is an infectious optimism about Mr John Hume, the leader and founding
member of the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), that sheds a few rays
of light on to the otherwise impenetrable gloom that has come to
characterise Northern Ireland politics.
He is convinced that nationalism, be it catholic- or protestant-orientated,
will gradually dissipate in the new European union that is being forged in
Brussels. This conviction is the driving force behind his vision for new
political structures in Northern Ireland which, he believes, will eventually
transcend the border on the island of Ireland and make it irrelevant.
Mr Hume says: 'What we are facing is an absolute reality that the world is a
smaller place, in terms of technology, transport and communications. It is
natural that that change should be reflected in political institutions. Once
upon a time we had city-states. Then we moved to nation-states and now we
are moving to a continental one. It is a natural evolution. We are living in
a post-nationalist world'.
Is he not discouraged by the recent chaos in the ERM and the setbacks to
monetary union? 'It simply reinforces my view that the logic of a single
market is a single currency' he replies.
John Hume cut his political teeth in the civil rights movement in
Londonderry in the late 1960s, when he sat in front of British armoured cars
and mediated between crowds of rock-throwing youths and army officers, was
drenched by water cannons and arrested for his efforts. He went on to become
a founding member of the SDLP in 1970 - 'to re-define nationalism,' in his
own words.
'The problem is about people, not territory - it is the people that are
divided, not the territory. We have to find the mechanisms for uniting
people. Only when people start working together, spilling sweat and not
blood, will the old prejudices disappear. There is no other way of solving
the problem'.
One of his abiding memories is as a 10-year-old watching an Orange Order
march in Derry, when his father, unemployed at the time, placed a hand on
his shoulder and said: 'Just remember, John, you can't eat flags.'
John Hume says he was strongly influenced by the non-violent preachings for
change advocated by Martin Luther King in the US, and by the whole process
of the creation of the European Community.
He has been in talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, since
last April, with a view to bringing about a permanent ceasefire between the
IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries in the province.
Mr Hume is not one to be baulked by criticism of his ideas or his tactics.
'I am criticised for my approaches, but nobody else is putting any new
proposals on the table. I want to see an agreed Ireland, not a united
Ireland. I want a new Ireland in a new Europe. I am more confident now about
the future than I have been for the past 20 years. In 10 to 20 years more
there will be a whole new ball game.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): Back seat figurehead /
Profile of James Molyneaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS leader of Northern Ireland's largest political party, the Ulster
Unionists (UUP), Mr James Molyneaux is the figurehead of traditional,
mainstream Unionist politics and values in the province.
His is the distilled voice of a majority Protestant population which, down
the years, has had to face the gradual erosion of its privileged status in
holding the reins of Ulster's political and economic power.
The provincial government at Stormont was dissolved in 1972, replaced by
direct rule from Westminster. And then in 1985, for the first time, the
Anglo-Irish agreement gave the Irish Republic a consultative role in any
future constitutional arrangements for the province.
Reaction to those changes has pushed Unionism in a number of different
directions. Devolutionists, integrationists, power-sharers and even
pro-'independentists' have all sought to push the UUP into their chosen
path.
It is Mr Molyneaux's claim to achievement that he has held the party
together through these internal struggles - despite the radical shift of one
trend of Unionism into the hard-line DUP, another trend into paramilitary
activities, and the loss of voters to the confessionally-neutral Alliance
party and, more recently, the Conservatives.
Elected to Westminster for the South Antrim constituency in 1970, where he
had been constituency secretary to his predecessor, Mr Molyneaux assumed
leadership of the parliamentary party in 1974, and went on to be elected
party leader in 1979. He is a leading exponent of the 'integrationist' line
of Unionist politics: his principal political goal is to improve and
democratise direct rule from Westminster - the political arena in which he
feels most at ease - rather than argue the case for devolution.
Arthur Aughey, an academic and writer on Unionist politics, says: 'Molyneaux
has always been a Westminster man and is well respected for his honesty and
integrity and his competence at the parliamentary game. His way of defending
the Union was the undemonstrative, the quiet and patient cultivation of
sympathy behind the scenes'.
But Mr Molyneaux's faith in his ability to sway Westminster politicians came
unstuck in 1985 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime
minister, signed the Anglo-Irish agreement with the Republic.
More recently, his party's support for John Major's government at
Westminster during two crucial and closely-contested votes, on pit closures
and on the Maastricht Treaty, brought accusations of a behind-the-scenes
deal - but to date it has brought no tangible benefits for the UUP.
Government ministers have insisted that no concessions have been offered or
will be made in exchange for the UUP support.
A shy, almost reclusive figure, Mr Molyneaux frequently avoids the
spotlight, leaving public statements on party policy to his deputy leader,
Mr Ken Maginnis. During the series of 'round-table' inter-party talks on
Northern Ireland during 1991 and 1992, which broke up without agreement,
participants say he often took a back seat, sitting silently and leaving
much of the negotiation and argument to Mr Maginnis.
When one round of the talks took the historic step of moving to Dublin in
1992, Mr Molyneaux was notable for his absence from the UUP delegation.
Now 73 years of age, he has been criticised for failing to move the
narrowly-focused mainstream of Unionist politics into the era of European
union. He has also been accused of failure to seize opportunities and
initiatives to achieve a breakthrough in the political log-jam that has
characterised Northern Ireland for the past two decades.
Such a breakthrough could only happen with the initiative and support of the
UUP, the majority party. But Mr Molyneaux seems content to leave that
crowning achievement out of his political memoirs.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Facelift transforms Derry's
ancient walls - Optimism in Ulster's second city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SITUATED close to Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic, Derry
has historically been associated with the 'troubles'.
But a new mood of optimism has swept the city in recent years, as
politicians, businessmen and community leaders have succeeded in putting
their religious differences aside to rebuild what is now evolving into a new
provincial capital serving communities on both sides of the border.
A new, privately-financed Pounds 60m shopping and office complex is emerging
from the city's old dockside. Downstream, along the river Foyle, contractors
are putting the finishing touches to the city's new port.
Tourists are finding attractions in new museums, a craft village and the
facelift carried out on Derry's city's 17th century city walls, while locals
take encouragement from a new factory that is being built by Seagate, the US
computer disk drive manufacturer, which is investing Pounds 45m in a new
wafer fabrication plant in the city to supply the European market. The
Seagate plant will provide some 500 urgently-needed jobs for the 8,500
currently in Derry's dole queues.
It is a far cry from the darkest inward-looking days of the early 1970s,
when the civil rights movement was bludgeoned from the streets, Bloody
Sunday turned the Catholic community against the British army, and an IRA
bombing campaign laid waste to the city centre.
Northern Ireland's second city - Londonderry on the maps, but known as Derry
to most of its locals - has undergone a transformation as a result of a
concerted effort by the Northern Ireland Office to improve the city's roads
and infrastructure and to improve housing standards, and by the initiative
of locals such as Mr Paddy Doherty, the chairman of the Inner City Trust,
who has been a key figure behind the renovation of the city centre.
Equally important have been the efforts of Mr John Hume of the SDLP, the
local MP, who has rallied the local business community - Protestant and
Catholic - to go on trade delegations together to woo US investors and
bargain in Brussels for a share of EC structural funds.
Mr Michael Black, the president of the Derry Chamber of Commerce, says: 'The
city is on the up. There is tremendous confidence and optimism in the
business community here. People have stopped griping and are going out to
find business. Everybody is now working in the same direction'.
The city itself has a population of just 80,000, but its potential economic
catchment area embraces the population of the county of Donegal in the
Republic, and even parts of Sligo. This adds a further 150,000 people and
makes retail developments a particularly attractive proposition,
particularly since the removal of customs posts at the border since the
beginning of the year, under the new EC Single Market regime. Marks and
Spencer is to be the anchor tenant in the new Foyleside shopping complex.
once it is completed in early 1995.
Mr Damian McAteer, an executive at the EC-funded Business Innovation Centre
in the city, says: 'Retail-led development has to be welcomed for the jobs
and dynamism it creates, but we have to diversify into manufacturing to
create the wages that will sustain the retail sector. We have to look at
ourselves as North West plc, with a coherent development strategy for the
region.'
Mr Paddy Doherty of the Inner City Trust sees the new developments leading
to that goal. 'I don't think manufacturers are going to come into a rundown
place. It's got to have vitality. Our hope is that on the coat-tails of the
inner city regeneration and the commercial developments, we will attract
industry here.'
One significant development stimulating the existing local industry has been
a cross-border project linking the Derry and Letterkenny chambers of
commerce. Mr Don McSwiney, the project's chief executive, says:
'The people of Donegal look to Derry as their regional centre. The business
community is therefore beginning to structure itself on a regional basis. We
are bringing sectoral groups together from both sides of the border to
encourage them to work together in purchasing and marketing, to learn from
each other's experiences and to stop being inward-looking and to look to
Europe as a market.'
Working groups are already established in the clothing, textiles, food,
drink, information technology, telecommunications, crafts and legal services
sectors. Other initiatives are linking up local businessmen with the US
market.
Mr Ian Young, a board member of North West International (formerly
Boston-Derry Ventures) is a Protestant, owner of a local electrical
engineering firm. He said that the business community in Derry have found
they can do business better by putting aside their political and
confessional differences, and as a result have received good responses in
the US and in Brussels to their trade missions and lobbying.
Mr Black, who is also on the board, said 'We are selling the city as a place
for US investment'.
The results are beginning to show. Dupont has been in the city for the past
30 years, but Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, is completing
a yarn spinning plant in Derry to supply its garments plant across the
border at Buncrana, while Seagate began work on its new facility just six
months ago. Earlier this year Mr Michael Roarty, the president of the
US-Ireland chamber of commerce and vice-president of Anheuser Busch (brewer
of Budweiser lager) said the new investments were 'a powerful indicator of
the very bright horizons that lie ahead for the city'.
Bringing those horizons even closer are the Pounds 22m investment in the new
port for Derry, which will handle ships up to 30,000dwt and which has been
located alongside a zone earmarked for industrial expansion; and the Pounds
9m recently spent in upgrading the nearby Eglinton airport to accommodate
aircraft up to Boeing 737 size. New passenger services to Dublin and London
are expected to be opened in 1994.
Twenty years ago, it was Derry's historical and geographical problem to have
had the Irish border drawn so near to its city limits. Imagination,
foresight and political courage have since turned that problem to the city's
advantage. For many people in the north-west corner of the island, the
border is no longer the barrier it once was.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): Expertise on call around the
world - Agriculture enjoys a clean and green image second to none
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DRAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE face of agriculture, Northern Ireland's largest industry, is changing.
Gone are the times when a trip to market was little more than an outing to a
provincial town 20 miles away. Today the world is smaller: produce from the
province's farms and factories is sold in far flung places.
And greater interest is being taken in what the industry has to offer, not
only in the way of foodstuffs, but also in livestock on the land. For
example, buyers from as far away as Korea have made no fewer than four
visits to Northern Ireland in search of pedigree pig breeding lines. On
their most recent trip, last month, they picked up 120 high quality boars,
bringing the number ofanimals they have bought in the province to a total of
500.
It was an outbreak of Blue Ear disease among the mainland pig population in
Britain that first focused Korean attention on Northern Ireland pig farms.
Like many visitors before them, the Koreans have discovered that Northern
Ireland has an enviable animal health record.
Because it is part of a small island, Northern Ireland's 'clean and green'
image is second to none. This has been reinforced over the past couple of
years, since the introduction, by the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing
Commission, of a Farm Quality Assured Scheme for beef and lamb. To date the
scheme has attracted some 3,251 farmers who between them account for 69 per
cent of the annual beef slaughterings in Northern Ireland.
Beef from the province is now marketed in Holland under the Greenfields
label, through the Albert Heijn supermarket chain which dictates that
supplies are from Quality Assured farms.
A party of six Northern Ireland representatives of meat companies, on a
mission to find niche markets, flew to Brussels two months ago, taking with
them local beef and lamb for a special dinner. As a result of their trip
they have identified significant sales outlets for both products; they
intend to increase sales orders to Belgium.
With the prospect of a steep decline in the level of EC Intervention buying,
an increase in marketing missions from Northern Ireland is to be expected.
Three years ago, some 40 per cent of all slaughterings in Northern Ireland
were sold into Intervention, and the fact that this facility could drop to
about 10 per cent in two to three years is a sobering thought for those who
market meat.
On a more cheerful note, Northern Ireland farmers have been offered an
opportunity to supply two important continental supermarket groups with bull
beef. Mr Brendan McGahan, chief executive of the Livestock Marketing
Commission, says: 'The Edah group, which specifies young bulls, is presently
beingsupplied by Dutch and French farmers. It sees supplies from its own
country becoming scarcer as stocking rates, fertiliser use restrictions and
quota considerations begin to reduce stock numbers on their supply farms.'
For years, dairy farmers throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland have
used their own milk marketing boards. Now that is coming to an end.
Something of a 'milk war' has developed in the province between Nestle, the
international giant, which has a factory at Omagh in Co Tyrone; Strathroy
Milk Marketing, which is based nearby; Pritchitt Foods of Newtownards; Dale
Farm, which is part of the Northern Foods operation; and Leckpatrick
Dairies, which is now owned by Cork-based Golden Vale.
All have one thing in common: they want to link up with the province's dairy
farmers - there are more than 6,000 - in direct purchase contracts.
As it dies, the Milk Marketing Board (MMB) is asking producers to help form
a voluntary co-operative - but the future of Dromona Quality Foods, the
MMB's marketing arm, is a bone of contention. The MMB wants to retain it,
under the umbrella of the new co-operative; the Northern Ireland Dairy
Trades Federation and several processors want a divorce between the MMB and
Dromona. The Office of Fair Trading's opinion is that 'the continued
retention of Dromona Quality Foods within the new co-operative would be
unwelcome in competition'.
Dairy farmers can speak no ill of Dromona Quality Foods - its profitability
brought them a handout of Pounds 1.8m in July this year. Furthermore,
Dromona has just announced a 26 per cent increase in its annual profit, to
Pounds 3.4m, having enjoyed its best-ever trading performance - its turnover
increased by Pounds 10m to Pounds 78m despite the MMB paying 16 per cent
more for milk supplies. Mr Jim Noble, Dromona's managing director, says:
'The past year was one of challenge and opportunity in the dairy market both
at home and internationally.'
Expanded sales to Great Britain and Europe, coupled with aggressive
marketing on the international scene through Halib Foods International, has
contributed to the success. Halib, the wholly-owned, exporting subsidiary of
Dromona Quality Foods, has just clinched orders worth Pounds 1.6m to supply
milk powder to three important new overseas outlets in, respectively, El
Salvador, Bangladesh and a Central African state. It is hoped that this
could develop into long term business worth Pounds 6.5m a year.
Looking at Northern Ireland's farms during the past year, the most recent
government statistics show gross output rising by 9 per cent to Pounds 935m
in 1992, while expenditure rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 513m. Total income
from farming in the province - a land area about the size of Yorkshire -
rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 224m. The Department of Agriculture says that
in real terms, after allowing for inflation, this represents a rise of 20
per cent to a level well above the 1980s average.
Provisional estimates of gross annual capital investment in agriculture
indicate little change from the relatively low level of investment in 1991.
At Pounds 103m, total investment was less than 1 per cent above the level of
the previous year. While investment in plant, machinery and vehicles fell by
7 per cent to Pounds 45m, investment in buildings and works rose by 7 per
cent to Pounds 58m, almost all the increase taking place under the
Agricultural Development Operational Programme.
The beef breeding herd increased by 4 per cent, to 264,000 cows, during the
past year; but numbers of dairy cows fell by 2 per cent, to 269,000. A
slower rate of expansion in the sheep flock continued in 1992, with a 2 per
cent increase in both the breeding flock and total sheep numbers. (But at
2.6m there are still more sheep than people in Northern Ireland.)
Cattle account for 33 per cent, sheep for 8.9 per cent of Northern Ireland's
total receipts. The dairy sector at 26.3 per cent, the poultry and eggs
sector at 10.6 per cent and the efforts of pigs producers, with 9.1 per
cent, make up much of the remainder. Horticulture, at 4 per cent,
contributes more than crops, which produce only 3.4 per cent of farming
receipts; other small items make up 4.7 per cent.
Ulster farmers will say that things on the land are just as difficult as
they ever were . . . but they will continue to make a living from it. In the
wider context, Northern Ireland expertise in food and farming is widely used
around the world, especially in the Middle East, where the Masstock
Organisation has been 'greening the desert' for more than a decade.
Now the spotlight falls on Russia. Researchers from the faculty of
agriculture and food science at Queen's University, Belfast, are
spearheading an EC-funded project aimed at improving the efficiency of the
supply of fresh produce and dairy products in Russia. The Queen's team is
part of a consortium which has won funding of Pounds 650,000 under the
Community's Tacis programme - Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of
Independent States and Georgia - to lead an investigation co-ordinated by
Northern Ireland Public Sector Enterprises Ltd.
The consortium will carry out a study of the milk, fruit and vegetable
sectors and establish a food control programme in the Serpukhov district and
Pushchino municipality, part of the Moscow region, about 100 kilometres
south of the capital. The project is seeking to help with the privatisation
of Russian farms and food distribution organisations.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): Political stalemate remains
a constraint - Why recession was less severe than on the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RODWELL

<TEXT>
Among Ulster's business community there is general agreement with a view
expressed in a recent NI Economic Research Centre report that the province
has had a 'good' recession.
Ulster's GDP scarcely blipped; in mainland Great Britain it fell by 3.9 per
cent between 1990 and 1992. The number in work in Northern Ireland fell by
very little and has remained close to its historically high peak of 1990.
Such rise in unemployment as there was can generally be attributed to the
arrival of newcomers on the job market.
Such are the demographic realities that Northern Ireland has to run fast in
its job creation even to stand still in terms of its unemployment rate.
From Belfast, observers have been able to take a fairly relaxed view of the
tribulations of the British economy since 1989. Although measured from a
lower datum line, Ulster's dive was less steep. The big rise in unemployment
nationally, particularly in southern England, was no more than what Northern
Ireland had gone through in the early 1980s with the disappearance of much
of its manufacturing base.
Two factors in particular explain the gentleness of Ulster's dive.
One is its heavy dependence for employment on the relatively recession-proof
public sector. It accounts for some 40 per cent of employment, according to
Doctor Vani Barooah, professor of applied economics at the University of
Ulster. 'The spending of that 40 per cent means that about 70 per cent of
jobs are ultimately dependent upon the public sector.'
Equally important is the absence of the speculative property boom which
occurred in Great Britain during the late 1980s. It simply did not happen in
Northern Ireland. House prices rose steadily, but there was none of the
dramatic surge which led so many people into high mortgages and, with market
slump, into the negative equity trap. There have been no significant
repossessions: if you have a job at all in Northern Ireland you are unlikely
to be crippled by a mortgage you can no longer afford.
Disposable incomes have not, therefore, been under such heavy pressure; the
Northern Ireland public has continued to spend to an extent which causes
many first-time visitors to express surprise at apparent prosperity where
the image had been one of deprivation.
But confidence has been bruised by the national gloom. It is rated
low-to-medium rather than medium-to-high by Paddy Murphy, chief executive of
the Bank of Ireland in Northern Ireland: 'We are seeing a very slow pick-up
 -slower than we would have expected.'
While the Bank of Ireland reports a 60 per cent increase in mortgage
business this year over last, some of this is accounted for by considerable
growth in its market share. But credit demand among companies is also
markedly up.
Mr Murphy says: 'There have been a lot of approvals recently, but borrowers
are slow to draw the money. They're getting ready for expansion, but the
trigger to make them go is still not there.'
That cannot be said for Ulster's largest family firm, Desmond and Sons,
garment manufacturer, which recently announced a Pounds 24m expansion which
will add 600 jobs and a new plant to the 2,700 workers in 11 locations
already. The announcement gave particular satisfaction to economic planners
in Belfast because this investment is in the province's poorest region, west
of the river Bann. Moreover, it is being made by an indigenous,
locally-owned company rather than some remote multi-national with no deep
commitment to the province.
'A number of people we're working with are looking at projects, at
acquisitions. They haven't all acquired them, but six months ago they
weren't even looking. There is a re-awakened interest in new activity,' says
Mr Tony Hopkins, managing partner in Northern Ireland of Touche Ross,
accountants.
Mr Hopkins brings a particular perspective to a region where, he says, the
close intermeshing of public and private sector decision makers is unique in
the UK. For 10 years until June last year, he was on the staff of the
Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board - the last four years as its
chief executive. He pays tribute to the way in which successive governments
have shaped policies, for 20 years, to the local need rather than the
national dogma of the day.
Mr Hopkins claims that Northern Ireland managers are now considerably more
professional and competent than a decade or so ago: 'The message of
competitiveness is now well embedded. They have got out into the export
markets and overcome the diffidence factor. The business basics are now
right, and there is a great bank of talent coming out of the schools and
universities. The province is well poised - and the last year has been good
for inward investments.'
No local observer would argue with Professor Barooah's contention that
closing the big employment gap between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain
will require radical restructuring and regeneration of the province's
manufacturing base. 'As an engine for employment generation, the public
sector has run out of steam. The only sector which isn't reliant on public
largesse has to be manufacturing and that is the sector which has run down
most in the past 40 years.'
The years are long gone when Belfast alone was a world centre in several
industries now much diminished: shipbuilding; linen; ropes; textile
machinery and tobacco.
There must be closer links between finance and industry and a pro-active
policy to back winners - on the lines of East Asian 'tigers' (Japan, Korea
and Taiwan) - says Professor Barooah.
He and others look enviously at the Irish Republic's success in attracting
the so-called 'sunrise' industries despite an industrial infrastructure much
less advanced than that in Ulster. It is a reminder of what might have been
achieved were it not for the effects of more than 20 years of political
instability and terrorism.
Business interests are themselves trying to produce some easing in the
political stalemate on which terrorism thrives. The Northern Ireland Chamber
of Commerce and Industry has for some months been holding unpublicised
working breakfasts with the various party leaders; sell-out occasions at
which the politicians have been implored by the assembled membership to work
together for the province's economic good.
'First results have been encouraging but we have a long way to go. There is
an amazing amount of agreement between them on economic issues and how to
achieve our aims,' says Paddy Murphy, in his other role as the chamber's
vice-president.
'So far we've only hosted them apart. The next step will be to get them
together.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Signs of change are in the

confidence is strong, and cross-border economic co-operation brings hope for
better political relations

'There have been no bombings or sectarian-linked murders in Northern Ireland
now for the past five years.
'The so-called 'permanent ceasefire' by the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries
has held, and British troop levels in the province have been reduced to only
10 per cent of what they were in 1993.
'Negotiators from the unionist and nationalist camps, together with
representatives of the British and Irish governments, under EC chairmanship,
are now entering their final phase of negotiations for a permanent
settlement of a dispute that has divided the people of the island since
1921.
'The settlement plan is expected to be put to a simultaneous referendum in
both parts of Ireland within six months of the signing of the agreement by
all parties'.
OF course such a scenario is futuristic fiction. But it is not fantasy.
For this vision of a future settlement is central to the only
publicly-acknowledged political dialogue taking place in Northern Ireland
since the round-table talks between the main political parties in the
province broke down with no agreement last November. That dialogue is
between Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party
(SDLP), and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein - the political wing of
the IRA.
Attacked by the Unionists for what they say is an effort to form a
'pan-nationalist front', Mr Hume says the dialogue is 'about agreeing an
overall strategy for a lasting peace - and an overall strategy includes
everybody.
'It is not a joint strategy as some people have tried to make out . . . what
I want is a complete and utter cessation of violence on all sides . . .
Gerry Adams is very serious, and the people he represents are very serious
about these talks and their objectives'.
So Mr Hume says: 'I have never felt more hopeful in 20 years than I do now.'
There are other grounds for believing that some change might be in the wind.
While the IRA's bombing campaign and the Loyalists' killings of Catholics
show no sign of letting up, the language of Sinn Fein has taken on a
decidedly more moderate and conciliatory tone over the past year. Sinn Fein
spokespersons now talk of 'inclusive dialogue' and 'recognition of the
Unionist identity'. They even say that a united Ireland - their preferred
option - might not necessarily be the end result of a negotiating process.
Presbyterian ministers have been holding secret talks with paramilitary
leaders on both sides over the past year, while the outlawed Loyalist Ulster
Defence Association (UDA) recently announced that it is prepared to meet and
talk to Archbishop Cathal Daly, the Catholic primate.
The Opsahl Commission, an independent body set up in 1992 to sound out a
broad range of public opinion from across the province, concluded earlier
this year that there is a strong desire for political compromise to end the
violence - a message from the constituencies which, apparently, many of the
province's politicians have still not heard.
Intriguing reports have also appeared, over the summer, of secret
negotiations between the army and the IRA on a 60-point military
de-escalation plan. These have been strenuously denied by both the Northern
Ireland Office and Sinn Fein, but they add to a more general impression that
although the mainstream political process has ended up in limbo, nonetheless
intensive efforts are being made behind the scenes to broker a peace.
The key to whether Mr Hume can now succeed in his more public efforts to
achieve a cessation of hostilities, as a means of getting everybody around
the negotiating table, will be whether the British government's stated
position that it has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland, that it is
neutral in the conflict, and has no preferred option for a settlement, will
stand up under the strains of Westminster politics.
Just before the summer recess at Westminster, the Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP) led by Mr James Molyneaux, voted with Mr John Major and his
Conservative party on a finely-balanced Maastricht vote. Mr Molyneaux
announced that the UUP would be giving its support to the Conservatives for
the remaining life of the present parliament, but simultaneously denied that
any deal had been struck with the Tories.
But there now exist high expectations among Unionist politicians in the
province that long sought after changes in the administration of Northern
Ireland will take place over the next two years.
These include the establishment of a parliamentary select committee on
Northern Ireland, and for more powers to be handed over to local councils
from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). One UUP councillor in Londonderry
says: 'We have discussed and been lobbying for this at Westminster for some
time.'
If such changes were to be implemented unilaterally, the Irish government
has already indicated that it would consider this tantamount to a violation
of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Treaty.
Mr Hume says: 'Any secret agreement between the British government and one
party in Northern Ireland would have no chance of succeeding, particularly
if it is related to restoring power to local authorities before it has been
clearly established that any such power would be exercised fairly . . . To
play party politics of that nature with Northern Ireland in order to stay in
power is utterly irresponsible. Everybody will end up paying a price for it
including the government that enters into such an agreement.'
Abandonment of the talks process, and the adoption of a more unilateralist
approach by the UK government, would deal a severe blow to Anglo-Irish
relations.
Ministers from the two governments meet this week in London to review
whether there is any life remaining in the talks process, and indeed whether
they can still claim to share a bipartisan approach.
The Republic has indicated it might now take a different tack and seek the
appointment of a US special envoy to the province. It is thought that such
an envoy would not be as constrained about talking to Sinn Fein as would the
Irish and British governments.
So while fresh approaches may be imminent on the political front, there is
also optimism emerging on the economic one. The clouds of recession have
already broken up over Northern Ireland and business confidence is now the
strongest in years. Unemployment is beginning to fall and retail sales are
growing.
All these act as spurs to new investment such as that in Londonderry, where
Pounds 65m is being spent on a new shopping and office complex in the city
which will serve an economic hinterland on both sides of the border.
Several important new foreign and local investments have been announced in
the past year, and continuing infrastructural improvements in the roads,
ports and airports are making the province an increasingly attractive
location for both business and tourism. Last year a record number of 1.25m
visitors came to Northern Ireland, and a further 20 per cent increase is
forecast for this year.
Meanwhile, Northern Irish farmers are enjoying rising incomes, despite
reforms to the common agricultural policy. The food processing industry
appears to be adapting well to the cutbacks in intervention buying; instead,
it is successfully exploring new markets within Europe. The continuing
importance of agriculture to the economy can be appreciated from the fact
that about 50 per cent of exports through the busy ro-ro (roll on, roll off)
port of Larne are of agricultural produce.
Economic analysts believe that any sustained recovery must await recovery
elsewhere in the UK and Europe, and that the severe problem of long-term
structural unemployment in the province has still to be adequately
addressed. A regeneration of manufacturing industry is considered
particularly important, to balance the declines in traditional industries
such as shipbuilding, heavy engineering and textiles.
The government insists that it is doing all it can; indeed, its Pounds 3bn
annual subsidy to Northern Ireland has resulted in a housing and
communications infrastructure that is now superior - or at least comparable
 -to many other parts of the UK. Ministers argue that it is the IRA bombing
campaign and the political violence which are holding back economic growth
and the necessary private inward investment.
Evidence for that can be found in the city of Londonderry - once the symbol
of the 'troubles'. Here, local businessmen are brimming with confidence,
'power-sharing' on the local council has got the politicians working
together for the city, and IRA bombs have not been heard for years.
That is the picture of Northern Ireland which Mr Hume would like to see
replicated in the rest of the province. If, indeed, his talks with Mr Adams
are progressing as satisfactorily as he claims, then it need not be so
far-fetched to imagine a very different outlook facing Northern Ireland in
another year's time.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Not just a question of
price - Guy de Jonquieres examines the demand for better value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Branded consumer goods manufacturers would do better to meet shoppers'
growing demands for better value for money by improving product quality and
service, rather than simply cutting prices, according to the Henley Centre*,
a UK market research company.
The company says opinion surveys for the latest edition of Frontiers, its
annual study of European consumer markets, have found that while recession
has made low price a more important issue for some consumers, for most it is
still far from the overriding consideration.
Indeed, in Britain, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, fewer
consumers than two years ago said they always looked for the cheapest
products.
The only exception to the trend was Germany - particularly the eastern part
of the country.
However, European consumers are also becoming more insistent on getting what
they pay for. Fewer than in 1989 - at the peak of the economic boom - said
they believed that highest price equalled highest quality.
This shift in perceptions was most pronounced in relation to cosmetics, and
smallest in relation to wine, spirits and furniture.
As these examples suggest, judgments on what constitutes good value differ
widely, depending on the type of product in question.
For instance, almost three quarters of consumers named lower prices as the
best way of improving the value for money of clothing. But fewer than a
third said the same of food, with twice as many saying what they most wanted
were products containing more natural ingredients.
But the Henley Centre says the biggest challenge confronting European
consumer goods manufacturers in the value-conscious 1990s is the growing
popularity of retailers' own-brand products.
Increasingly, European consumers prefer supermarkets' own-brand lines not
only because they are cheaper than manufacturer brands, but also because
they are perceived to offer equal or superior quality. 'The key point is
that the 'best' brands are now often the retailer ones,' the Henley Centre
says.
The most striking evidence of this trend is provided by a survey of
customers of Albert Heijn, the leading Dutch supermarket, who were asked to
compare the retailer's own-brand products with those of Nestle of
Switzerland, the world's largest food manufacturer.
On all the criteria chosen - which included trustworthiness, product
innovation and packaging, as well as price - Albert Heijn was rated far
ahead of Nestle. The retailer's biggest perceived advantage was in caring
about its customers.
The Henley Centre concludes consumer manufacturers need to respond to these
challenges by working harder to improve the performance and functional
qualities of products and relying less on pure imagery to sell them.
They also need to find new ways to communicate directly with consumers which
do not involve going through retailers.
In particular, they should put more emphasis on loyalty programmes,
after-sales support and service.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The gay consumer - US
companies are recognising the buying potential of the homosexual community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With US President Bill Clinton recently achieving some success in his
attempt to lift the ban on gays in the military, plus his appointment of a
leading lesbian politician, Roberta Achtenberg, to the White House, the
homosexual community is gaining wider social acceptance in America. At the
same time companies in the US are taking increasing note of gays as a
distinct consumer group.
Approximately 10 per cent of the adult population, or 18.5m people, is
thought to be homosexual in the US. So the new attention is, perhaps, hardly
surprising.
'There is little loyalty today from the consumer, but we find that gay
consumers exercise great loyalty to those companies that support or
recognise them,' says Taylor Ingraham, director of marketing for the North
American division of Virgin Atlantic Airways.
There are enormous benefits attached to tapping into the gay market. As the
majority of like-sex households are dual salaried without children, they fit
into the marketers favourite bracket of big spenders with high disposable
income. According to Rick Dean, the senior vice-president of Overlooked
Opinions, a Chicago-based polling and market research firm specialising in
homosexual consumers, the average gay couple has an annual income of Dollars
50,000 (Pounds 33,500). Dean maintains that gays are avid travellers and
purchasers of high-quality products in almost every market sector.
Consequently, industry leaders such as Banana Republic, Giorgio Armani and
Virgin Atlantic Airways have begun advertising their products in Out
magazine - one of approximately 150 gay publications in the US.
But does gay marketing work? Banana Republic refuses to comment on the
motives behind its gay marketing programme but will say the company is
planning to continue the advertising campaign in Out magazine for the
foreseeable future - in itself proof that the programme is working.
Ingraham, on the other hand, is able to identify tangible results from
Virgin's alternative marketing campaign and says: 'We have made a number of
large-scale bookings from these ads. Plus, we have had calls from people
thanking Virgin for the advertising and for addressing them specifically.
Like any other sector of the community, gays will support those companies
and organisations that support them.'
Joseph Ellert, a freight forwarder with an international shipping company
based in San Francisco, regards himself as a classic gay consumer. He
applauds those companies that recognise him and other homosexuals as
valuable customers.
'We have the bucks, in fact we have more money to spend than many other
sectors of the market. If I see something advertised in the gay media, I am
more likely to take a second look at that product and consider purchasing
it, than if it was advertised in a straight publication. It shows that the
company recognises we exist and addresses us directly,' says Ellert.
It would appear that corporate America is starting to wake up to the power
of the gay consumer. While undertaking market research for various clients
considering a launch into homosexual markets, Dean found there are business
opportunities abounding in this traditionally ignored sector.
As a result he set up a long-distance telephone company in competition with
AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI. Community Spirit allocates 2 per cent of every
telephone bill to the subscriber's chosen gay, lesbian or Aids charity. 'We
took a benign, non-eventful product and gave it a gay identity,' says Dean.
Within seven months of the launch, Community Spirit has 20,000 subscribers
and attracts on average 1,000 new accounts a week. Among its subscribers are
not only gay consumers, but parents of children who have Aids, individuals
sympathetic to the gay concerns and issues.
But if such profit and altruistic benefit are to be achieved from courting
the gay market, why haven't marketing gurus tuned in earlier?
According to Angie Novak, product manager of Paper Moon Graphics based in
Los Angeles, some companies are still sensitive to a possible stigma
attached to associating their products with a gay market. She believes that
less progressive companies are afraid of alienating 'straight' consumers who
might prefer not to purchase products and services openly targeted at the
gay sector.
When Paper Moon first launched its 'alternative lifestyle' line of greetings
cards, featuring gay couples and gay scenarios in a clean and decent but
humorous manner, the line did well in big cities such as San Francisco, Los
Angeles and New York. 'But we came across some challenging buyers in less
progressive areas, like Salt Lake City,' recalls Novak.
Paper Moon plugged a gap in the Dollars 5.3bn greetings card market, which
was not being met by industry leaders. Furthermore, Paper Moon donates 5 per
cent of 'alternative lifestyle' proceeds to gay-affiliated charities.
Equally, Ingraham clearly states that Virgin Airways is not afraid of
alienating straight customers by attracting gays.
'Why should there be a stigma against gays?' she asks. 'We don't exercise
any stigma against heterosexuals. People are people, they are all the same.
'Our gay advertising is not targeting gays any differently from other
consumer sectors. We are just targeting them in an environment they enjoy
and in which they feel comfortable. My primary aim is getting as many people
on board our planes as possible.'
The US is not alone in identifying the advantages of courting a gay
clientele.
A former female buyer in a leading UK menswear chain noticed a gradual
increase in sales of g-strings, thongs and 'skimpies' for men.
'Branch managers were demanding higher stock levels, as they claimed women
were buying them for their husbands and gays were buying them for their
partners, their friends and themselves.' The buyer, whose career blossomed
as a result, recognised that branches in towns with a strong gay affiliation
sold greater quantities of the risque men's underwear than branches in other
areas.
While some companies attribute their success in gay marketing to the fact
that they support the gay community by contributing to affiliated charities,
others are discovering that if the product is right and the marketing is
correctly targeted, success will follow in the gay market - as in any other
sector.

Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has announced an abrupt change of
design policy in response to environmental concerns and a growing sense that
product design should do more to reflect the cultural identity of target
markets.
Speaking at the Design Renaissance Conference in Glasgow this week, Stefano
Marzano, the company's director of corporate design, called for a 'new
ethic' within the industrial design profession. 'As we approach the
millennium, we are being confronted with the effects of a gross imbalance in
material circumstances around the world. We must try to restore the balance
in our natural environment and in our social and cultural environment.'
Conferences on design often include such statements. The difference is that
Marzano speaks from a power base within a large-scale manufacturing
industry. If pursued to its logical conclusion, his sentiment would
represent a U-turn for Philips which followed a globalist design policy
until Marzano's appointment in 1991.
Philips makes identical 'global' products in its manufacturing sites
worldwide. It now proposes to reflect the cultural preferences of segmented
markets in its products.
The shift sends an important signal to other manufacturers. Moves are in
hand at Philips to factor new thinking about sustainable growth and product
life-cycle assessment into the development process. But Marzano extended the
scope to social and cultural issues. Adopting such a policy would amount to
a new ethical standard. 'We must not fall into the trap of designing
products with features people don't need. What we can do instead - and this
is where we should be competing - is to give these products cultural
significance and value.'

Venture capitalists tend to be snooty about accountants despite the fact
that many come from the same background. A common complaint is that once an
accountant gets involved deals become bogged down in reams of financial
forecasts and scenarios.
But few venture capitalists would deny the contribution that John Hustler
has made to the industry over the years. As head of venture capital at KPMG
Peat Marwick, Hustler, has been an indefatigable toiler in the many
committees set up to consider arcane issues such as the valuation of
unquoted investments and performance measures for venture funds.
After Eton and accountancy training, Hustler, 47, became a partner at Peats
in 1983. He has since helped the European Commission devise a venture
capital scheme, advised three UK small firms ministers on venture issues and
spent two years as treasurer of the British Venture Capital Association.
He is now to practise what he has been preaching to many other entrepreneurs
and is setting up on his own as a consultant. As Hustler Venture Partners he
plans to advise entrepreneurs seeking funding. 'I want to look at the deals
the venture capitalists don't back to see if I can help turn them into
fundable propositions,' he says. One area he hopes to develop is that of
helping 'business angels', wealthy individuals with a commercial background,
to back new ventures. Hustler is particularly keen to get more money into
early stage ventures.
This could prove quite a challenge because the venture industry has moved
away from backing start-ups and early stage companies in recent years. But
Hustler is not afraid to stick his neck out. He has been a vocal defender of
the role of the accountant in the venture capital process when others have
kept their heads down.

FT  09 SEP 93 / People: Gestetner - Inchcape takes hold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the international services and marketing group which in May took a
15 per cent stake in Gestetner Holdings, is strengthening its ties with the
struggling office and photographic equipment distributor.
Stephen King, 44, Inchcape's director of financial control since 1987, has
been appointed finance director at Gestetner. He replaces Brian Copsey, who
is leaving to live full-time in Monaco, where he has been resident since
1986.
King will be continuing a close working relationship with his current boss,
Rod O'Donoghue, Inchcape's finance director, who joined the Gestetner board
as a result of the May deal, along with Andrew Cummins, Inchcape's strategic
director.
In spite of the close ties between the two companies, King's name was put
forward by an international executive search agency, which came up with five
candidates. The choice was finalised after David Thompson, until recently
non-executive chairman of Rank Xerox in the UK, agreed to move to Gestetner
as part-time chairman.
Inchcape has an option to increase its holding in Gestetner to 25 per cent
by July next year. Ricoh, the Japanese photocopier manufacturer, already has
a 24 per cent stake in the company, which is the world's largest independent
distributor of office equipment.
Gestetner's Australian management, under Basil Sellers as chairman and chief
executive, moved the group away from stencil duplicators towards
photocopiers, but also made an ill-judged expansion into the photographic
equipment market. Sellers remains on the board as a non-executive director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jon Foulds, chairman of Halifax Building Society since 1990, has been
appointed an independent member of the Bank of England's board of banking
supervision, otherwise known within the bank as 'Bobs'. He takes up his
appointment to Bobs following the death of Nigel Robson in February this
year.
A former chief executive and deputy chairman of the venture capital 3i
group, the 61-year-old Foulds holds a number of other directorships
including Eurotunnel, London Atlantic Investment Trust and Mercury Asset
Management.
In mid-1990, he left the engineering and aerospace group Brammer where he
had been non-executive chairman from 1988.
An advisory body, Bobs has a widely roving brief to speak to the governor of
the Bank of England on a variety of issues, particularly general principles
and policy concerning supervision of institutions which are authorised to
act under banking legislation.
It has teeth, if it cares to use them; during its last financial year,
1992-93, a period of upheaval in the aftermath of the collapse of BCCI, it
met 19 times as opposed to its more conventional 11.
'Appointments to the board are made jointly by the governor of the Bank and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and its members have the right to speak
directly to the Chancellor if they feel the advice they are giving is being
disregarded,' says Foulds. The board has six independent and three
ex-officio members from the Bank - the governor, deputy governor and head of
banking supervision.
The shooting, skiing and tennis-playing - 'when I have time' - Foulds will
receive a remuneration of Pounds 11,000 annually for his five-year stint at
the board.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: Grand old man battles on to restore the
golden age - Andrew Jack examines a persistent quest for reform by feisty
New York professor Abraham Briloff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REMARKABLE man sits in a squeaky swivel chair in a small and ramshackle
office, sharpening the barbs of his latest critique on the state of
contemporary accountancy. His name is Abraham Briloff.
'Abe' Briloff is unusual in many ways. First, because his office - the
launching pad of many robust attacks on the profession - is in New York
City, more commonly a base for raw capitalism than for radical critique.
Second, because that office is the headquarters of a small firm of certified
public accountants. For Briloff is a trained accountant in practice and no
mere ivory-tower academic nor someone with a simple nihilistic grudge
against the profession.
Third, because the location is opposite Baruch College, part of the City
University of New York system and the institution at which Briloff holds the
title of Emanuel Sachs distinguished professor accounting emeritus. For
neither is he a mere practitioner too buried in work to take a wider
perspective.
Fourth, because he matches this breadth with an enormous depth of
experience. Mr Briloff, still commuting to New York from the suburbs though
now with the aid of a cane and with failing eye-sight, is 76.
He turned to bookkeeping in the 1930s as a profession relatively cheap and
quick to enter, before falling under the influence of his accounting mentor,
Professor Emanuel Sachs, because he could not find a day job during the
Great Depression.
Fifth, because he has pioneered an approach to the subject which has
inspired other radicals among his academic colleagues, in contrast to those
in universities whom he calls 'apologists for the profession'.
Sixth, because he is not afraid to stick out his neck and openly criticise
firms and companies which transgress his standards, notably by penning
columns in Barron's, the weekly US business paper. He bears the battle scars
of a defamation lawsuit brought against him and the paper in 1976 by Saul
Steinberg, the corporate raider and head of Reliance Group.
And seventh, because all these characteristics have given him a credibility
which means he is regularly invited to appear before Congressional hearings
in Washington DC, and as an expert witness in court cases.
But what, with all these hefty credentials, does Briloff have to say?
Throughout his work - comprising four books and dozens of academic papers -
runs a consistent theme, expressed in a forceful, clear style.
Briloff argues the accountancy profession has breached the 'sacred covenant'
it holds with society through its licence to report on financial statements.
It is in terminal decline as it moves along its 'via doloroso'.
'In modern society, the accountant's certificate is more potent than the
chisel or the crowbar,' he says.
He calls for a return to the 'golden age' of the 1950s and 1960s when, he
argues, accountants were more concerned with being professionals than in
gathering new business. 'We need the responsibility, accountability,
integrity to fulfil the role with which society has vested us and we have
assumed willingly and received substantial compensation for doing.' He
contrasts the modest offices of large firms at that time with expensive
halls and atria of today's headquarters. He looks to a time when partners in
firms knew each other and felt a sense of 'direct personal responsibility'
for their work.
He laments the change from managing partners who were primarily auditors to
those who have won their positions through proud boasts of 'rainmaking' -
the ability to gather new business - and even dub themselves chief
executives.
In particular, Briloff regrets threats to the supposedly independent role of
the auditor when challenged by issues such as the growing and potentially
compromising role of carrying out management advisory services such as tax
work and computer consulting for audit clients - what he calls 'riding two
horses with one backside'.
He says this leads to a 'race for the bottom' as non-accountants become
partners, infuse intensely competitive practices and denigrate the firm's
independent audit responsibilities.
He cites instances of audit partners given loans under special circumstances
by a Texas savings &amp; loans institution which then collapsed, and of others
who swiftly moved from auditors to chief financial officers of client
companies.
More generally, he is concerned at the degree to which auditors have become
too associated with executives within companies which they audit, advising
on the structuring of financing and presentation of financial information
and acting as their advocates. 'We have become crucified by the bottom line
merchants,' he says. He refers derisively to the 'accounting alchemy' and
the accountants' 'magic wand' in favourably presenting information on leases
and the categorisation of debt instruments as equity.
He cites approvingly Judge Stanley Sporkin, of the US district court in
Washington, DC, in a decision in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loans case in 1990,
that 'accountants must be particularly sceptical where a transaction has
little or no economic substance' even if it might technically meet the
standards of US generally accepted accounting principles. But he sees no
evidence for optimism that accountants will heed this 'prayerful' plea.
At the same time, he criticises the SEC for weaknesses in its findings. Many
of its initially tough verdicts have been buried in compromise 'consent
orders' reached with companies. He is disappointed with the courts.
He has little time for the Public Oversight Board, created by Congress to
scrutinise the profession, but all too often in his belief acting as captive
to and advocate for it.
But his greatest wrath is saved for the accountancy firms and professional
bodies. He traces the interlocking power structure, with the 'Big Six' firms
influencing the board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, which has power over the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
He is scathing of the frequent appointment to committees, disciplinary
bodies and peer review panels of partners from large firms which have been
criticised for their own auditing work. For instance, tracing the background
to the widely-cited finding of the profession's 1978 Cohen Commission that
there is no evidence that providing other services has jeopardised audit
independence, he shows how all the data was compiled by staff and partners
in the larger accounting firms - analogous, he says, to 'sending a fox to
guard the hen house'.
Briloff's advantage is that he is aided in the USA by a mass of material
related to regulation and litigation. He has access to evidence obtained
from auditors in subpoenas, in front of Congressional hearings and in
discovery during litigation; and details emerging through court judgments
and rulings from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That is not to say that his views are accepted within the profession. Many
see him as extreme, unfair and wholly unrealistic. Few of his remedies have
been implemented.
Reflecting in an academic article earlier this year on his criticisms of the
profession in his 1972 book 'Unaccountable Accounting', he concludes sadly
that his vision for reform has 'come to naught' - except that the
aberrations he then identified have been extrapolated exponentially to
billions and tens of billions.
'If you are a teacher you have got to remain optimistic,' he says. 'You have
to feel that ideas have consequences and meaning. Otherwise you are being
hypocritical.' Against the predominance of the accounting establishment, a
few Abe Briloffs can be no bad thing.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Protest over return of electricians is defused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WALK-OUT by 11 unions from the floor of congress to protestover the
planned return of the electricians to the TUC was narrowly averted yesterday
after the intervention of Mr John Monks, the new TUC general secretary.
The union leaders involved agreed to wait for the outcome of a special TUC
general council meeting on the issue, to take place this morning, before
deciding on their next move.
But the issue has become embarrassing to the TUC, which is trying to look to
the future.
The 11 unions - including the TGWU general union, the Ucatt construction
union and the GPMU print union - remain dissatisfied with the peace formula
agreed last week by the general council to allow the electricians to return
to the TUC, after six years' absence, as a section of the recently merged
AEEU engineering and electrical union.
The TUC general purposes committee had rejected the unions' motion for an
emergency debate on the subject. The unions had called for a reassessment of
the electricians' reaffiliation issue, to be undertaken not later than
January 31 of next year.
After finishing his first keynote speech, Mr Monks had to leave the platform
and spend an hour persuading the unions not to go ahead with their walk-out.
With television cameras outside the meeting room's glass door, Mr Monks had
to use all his conciliatory skills to head off trouble which would have
tarnished his inaugural address.
The 11 unions want the AEEU's unconditional guarantee to abide by TUC rules,
its acceptance of TUC dispute committee awards, and an end to the AEEU
recruiting members in parts of the construction industry.
