FT  08 SEP 93 / American Airlines condemns EC rivals

AMERICAN Airlines, the largest US carrier, yesterday accused European
national flag carriers of undermining competition in the European airline
market by seeking to delay the passage of a new EC code of conduct for
airline computer reservation systems (CRS).
American Airlines, owner of the world's largest computer reservation system
called Sabre, has been frustrated in its efforts to expand its network in
Europe because of what it claims are efforts by European flag carriers to
maintain the dominant position of their own CRS systems in the European
market. The US company also claimed that European airlines such as Air
France, Iberia and Lufthansa are attempting to shelter themselves from
vigorous fare competition from smaller airlines provided through Sabre's
fare-shopping system. This allows users to find the lowest fare for a seat
on any airline in seconds.
The US complaint comes on the eve of a two-day meeting in Paris today of
European air transport officials. Mr David Schwarte, American Airlines'
legal adviser, said the US carrier hoped the meeting would help clear the
way for rapid approval by EC transport ministers of the new European CRS
code later this month. The code was blocked last June following pressure
from the Association of European Airlines (AEA), the trade organisation
grouping 23 European carriers.
The AEA complained that the code was tantamount to a 'sell-out of European
interests' because it would make it mandatory for large European carriers to
participate in Sabre. The AEA argued that mandatory participation by
European airlines would give American Airlines an unfair advantage because
the US carrier directly owned the CRS and would be able to monitor schedules
and bookings of the competition.
The AEA said the code would only be acceptable if there was a physical
separation (or what the industry calls dehosting) of the airline's internal
computer systems from the CRS marketed to the travel industry. European CRS
systems, owned by groups of airlines, are already dehosted and limit their
owners to viewing only their data.

FT  08 SEP 93 / EC to push workplace deregulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC MEMBER states are rallying behind the banner of labour market
deregulation, including more flexible working hours and lower costs for
employers, as the recipe for restoring growth and halting Europe's decline
in compet-itiveness.
A consensus in favour of change has emerged in working papers sent to the
European Commission in Brussels, although member states remain wary of
backing measures that might be interpreted as dismantling Europe's generous
welfare state provisions.
The competitiveness debate inside the EC has gathered pace amid growing
concern about Europe's failure to create jobs and the rising level of
unemployment. It has been given an added piquancy by a concerted effort from
the UK government to woo German support for a post-Maastricht agenda for the
EC.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, British minister for European affairs, yesterday
called for an end to 'dreaming about a single (European) currency' and more
attention to the pressing issue of competitiveness. He also launched a
fierce attack on the use of EC 'structural funds', which he suggested
created 'a culture of dependency' among poorer states.
In a speech to the European Policy Forum in London, the British minister's
call for more scrutiny of the EC budget and less interference from Brussels
appeared to be a calculated effort to play on latent German resentment at
being the paymaster of Europe and its desire for more 'subsidiarity'.
Mr Heathcoat-Amory said structural funds, which account for a third of the
present Ecu67bn (Pounds 51bn) annual EC budget, had siphoned money to poorer
regions in the Community; but they had also had a negative impact. They
might have contributed to Portugal's rise in inflation and
balance-of-payments difficulties in the 1980s, through increased imports.
He added: 'Greece has yet to show corresponding macro-economic benefits in
terms of GDP growth from structural funds; if anything, the gap between it
and the Community is growing.'
The minister's speech also attacked Mr Jacques Delors, who, as European
Commission president, offered initial ideas on boosting European
competitiveness to the EC summit last June. In spite of a good diagnosis,
'it prescribed medicines which were a mixture of the expensive, the
unoriginal and the inadequate'.
In his paper, Mr Delors favoured new spending on research and development,
better training, a lifting of restrictions on private employment agencies
and a more concerted effort to reach the economic convergence necessary for
European monetary union. He is to develop those ideas in a December white
paper.

<TEXT>
MR Bernard Tapie, chairman of Olympic Marseille, the top French football
team now in disgrace over match-rigging allegations, was yesterday called on
to rescue the team which faces financial ruin following its expulsion from
this season's European Cup.
Marseille, which in May became the first French team ever to win the
tournament, faces a serious shortfall in gate receipts after Monday's
decision by Uefa, the regulatory body for European football, to ban the club
from this season's competition.
Mr Tapie had threatened to file for the club's bankruptcy and resign if the
ban was upheld. The tournament is worth up to FFr150m (Pounds 17m) in
television rights, ticket sales and other revenues.
The ban has drawn angry, sorrowful reactions from the French press and fans
in the economically troubled French port, where the football team is one of
the few success stories. The mayor of Marseilles, Mr Robert Vigouroux,
yesterday urged Mr Tapie to keep the club alive.
Mr Tapie, a former socialist minister and entrepreneur who made a fortune in
the 1980s by buying up bankrupt companies, has invested heavily in Marseille
since becoming chairman in 1986.
However, his financial position is now considerably weaker as he has sold
most of his business interests, including his stake in Adidas, the German
sporting goods group.
Meanwhile, a number of other French clubs appeared to be procrastinating
over their pronouncements on Monday night that they would refuse to replace
Marseille as France's representative in the tournament.

UN officials yesterday warned that more 'ethnic cleansing' and brutality had
started in central Bosnia (see map), fuelled by the latest Bosnian partition
proposals, writes Gillian Tett. Up to 10,000 Moslems have fled from
Croat-held areas such as Stolac and Prozor to Jablanica, creating a
humanitarian crisis there.
Several thousand Croats have arrived in the Mostar region from Moslem areas.
The UNHCR yesterday said it was particularly concerned about 2,500 Moslems
said to be held in detention camps near Mostar. 'We have reports of people
being starved, beaten, forced to drink urine and executed,' a spokesman
said.

But Mr Schwarte said this issue was a 'red herring' aimed at delaying
implementation of the new CRS rules. 'It is the way a system is programmed
that determines whether or not it is neutral and provides appropriate
safeguards for confidential information,' he added.
He also said that if American Airlines compromised the neutrality of Sabre,
it would destroy the system's credibility. 'After an investment of nearly
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), we're hardly likely to put this at risk by not
playing the game according to the rules,' he said.

MOST French remain sceptical that last month's semi-float of European
currencies gives Paris much scope to tackle the country's record
unemployment, according to a Sofres poll to be published in Expansion
magazine tomorrow.
In what is the first French poll since the August 1 changes in the European
monetary system to focus on policies, 53 per cent said they did not believe
the widening of currency bands would allow France to start reversing the
loss in jobs. Faith in monetary union also appears unshaken: 64 per cent
believe the changes will merely delay a single currency; 12 per cent
consider monetary union still on target, while 9 per cent think the project
is dead.

BRITAIN was ordered yesterday to face a European human rights investigation
over a court order that a journalist disclose his source of information,
Reuter reports from Strasbourg.
The European Commission of Human Rights examined a complaint by British
journalist William Goodwin of The Engineer magazine that the 1989 order to
hand over his notes, upheld on appeal by the House of Lords, violated his
freedom of expression guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Commission declared Mr Goodwin's application admissible, meaning Britain
will have to defend itself before the European Court of Human Rights unless
the two sides reach a settlement.
It was the second time in two days that Britain had been ordered to face the
Strasbourg court. On Monday the Commission accepted a suit by relatives of
three unarmed IRA terrorists shot dead by British commandos in Gibraltar in
1988.
The Goodwin case concerns information the journalist obtained by telephone
about the financial problems of an undisclosed company, which was seeking a
loan.
The company said the information came from a stolen draft of its
confidential corporate plan and obtained a court order barring publication.

THE Belgian presidency of the EC yesterday called for new measures to better
defend the European monetary system against speculative attacks in the
currency markets.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, told the European Parliament
that firm proposals would be put to the EC summit in Brussels in December.
This would allow a period of reflection on the August 2 monetary crisis
which led to the de facto suspension of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Some EC
member states, including Belgium and France, have made noises about curbing
the power of 'financial speculators' but the majority are nervous about any
move which could be interpreted as the reimposition of capital controls.
In his testimony to MEPs yesterday, Mr Maystadt - accompanied by Mr Henning
Christophersen, EC economics commissioner - declined to outline specific
measures to protect the EMS but both suggested a Community approach would be
preferable. This involved protecting the EMS as a 'common good' and putting
more emphasis on the system bearing the risks of intervention to support
threatened currencies, rather than the targeted countries themselves.
Mr Maystadt said sticking to present parities within the new 15 per cent
fluctuation bands was dangerous: so too, was a return to the old, narrow
bands of 2.25 and 6 per cent respectively.

THE Greek government appeared close to collapse yesterday after the ruling
conservatives' majority in parliament was cut to just one vote.
A right-wing backbencher, Mr Stefanos Stefanopoulos, declared he was leaving
the New Democracy party to sit as an independent. Mr Stefanopoulos is one of
a handful of conservative deputies backing Mr Antonis Samaras, a former
foreign minister who founded a breakaway political party two months ago and
is now trying to topple the government.
On Monday, Mr Samaras, the leader of Political Spring party, called on
dissident conservative deputies to rally behind him, saying it was time to
'rebel against outdated attitudes'.
Mr Samaras, sacked as foreign minister last year for taking a hardline
position on Balkan policy, is thought to have at least five supporters in
parliament. But only two defections would be needed for him to succeed in
overturning the government's fragile majority in the 300-member chamber.
The prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, accused Mr Samaras, a former
political protege, of betrayal. He has already warned the dissidents that he
will seek an early election if the conservatives lose their parliamentary
majority.
Mr Mitsotakis held emergency meetings yesterday with cabinet ministers and
senior party officials. However, it was not clear whether any more of Mr
Samaras's supporters would leave New Democracy. The rebellion started a year
ago over the government's plans for structural reform.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Gore pledges Dollars 108bn savings with US government
overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR AL GORE, US vice-president, yesterday promised savings of Dollars 108bn
(Pounds 71.50bn) over five years from his proposals to cut waste, purge
rules and streamline bureaucracy in the federal government.
Mr Gore's report offers a recipe for creating 'a government that works
better and costs less' by scrapping cumbersome federal rules for buying
equipment or hiring staff and cutting 252,000 government jobs.
The vice-president has been regaling Washington for weeks with the elaborate
regulations he found in government purchasing manuals. These include the
10-page specifications for 'ash receivers, tobacco, desk type' which, to
qualify for government offices must break into no more than 35 pieces when
smashed on a maple plank, or the specular reflectance required for federal
floor wax.
'We found that government really does not work very well in ways that will
take a long time to fix. It is government using a quill pen in the age of
WordPerfect,' he said.
The report also tries to take a second bite at a number of programmes that
President Bill Clinton tried and failed to kill in his budget proposals
earlier this year, such as subsidies for producers of mohair and honey.
Standing in front of two fork-lift trucks piled high with government rules
and regulations, Mr Gore said his review could produce results, despite
opposition in some quarters of Congress to many of its suggestions.
Around one-third of the suggestions in the Gore report would require
legislative action. For the remainder, which could be accomplished by
executive order without any change in the law, Mr Clinton promised to take
the necessary action.
'This is one report that will not gather dust in a warehouse,' Mr Clinton
said.
While members of Congress appeared reluctant yesterday to criticise a report
whose general theme of cutting government waste commands wide popular
support, many are already rallying to oppose efforts to cut programmes that
fall under their jurisdiction or benefit their constituencies.
Some of Mr Gore's proposals cut across the entire federal government. They
include phasing out the federal personnel manual, a code of practice on
hiring and firing which requires 40,000 people to enforce it, coupled with
greater leeway for agencies and departments to set their own employment
rules.
Agencies would also be freer to buy equipment without going through
laborious government purchasing processes that mean the taxpayer pays more
for equipment than a private company would pay.
The report proposes merging or consolidating a number of government
departments. The Federal Bureau of Investigation would take over the
responsibilities of the Drug Enforcement Agency, and possibly also of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The air traffic control system
should be spun off into a government-owned corporation funded by user fees.
Branch offices would also be slashed among several organisations and
agencies.
The report would require all agencies to review their regulations over the
next two years with the aim of eliminating half.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Major rallies party against threat of Liberal Democrats:
Prime minister to visit regional activists in effort to restore morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives are launching a sustained offensive against the Liberal
Democrats, whom they now believe pose the main threat to traditional Tory
strongholds in the south.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will lead the fight with a visit to the
west country today to rebuild morale after the battering the Tories have
taken over the past year.
It will be the first in a series of meetings with party activists ahead of
the Conservative party conference in October.
Mr Major is to visit other regions this week, probably including the
Midlands and Scotland. His itinerary is being kept secret for security
reasons.
Switching targets from Labour to the Liberal Democrats, especially in the
south-west, is a recognition by Tory party strategists that they must win
back disaffected voters in those areas if they are to win the next general
election.
In July, the Liberals won a spectacular by-election victory in Christchurch
in Dorset, while at the local elections in May they took control of Cornwall
and Somerset county councils from the Tories, and became the largest single
party in Devon and Dorset.
Another disastrous performance in the European elections next June might put
Mr Major's leadership in jeopardy. The switch of focus from Labour, whom the
Tories believe are mired in their own difficulties, to the Liberal Democrats
is also designed to prevent that from happening.
The Conservative campaign will seek to portray Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, as an untrustworthy politician who tailors his arguments to
his audiences and so cannot be trusted to take a consistent line.
The campaign will also spell out elements of Liberal Democrat policy in
areas such as Europe and defence, which the government believes are least
likely to appeal to traditional Tory supporters - even when they are
disenchanted with their own party.
The initiative comes less than two weeks before the Liberal Democrats meet
at Torquay for their annual conference, at which they hope to build on their
recent electoral successes.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, spent two days in the south-west
this week as part of his tour of local associations, talking to constituency
chairmen and their deputies.
Speaking in north Dorset yesterday, Sir Norman said: 'The Liberal party take
a supportive view of a federal superstate, a federal Europe, the kind of
Europe we stand against. That distinction is not recognised by the public,
and we want to underline it.'
Renewed efforts to drive home the contrast between the Liberal Democrats and
themselves over the European Community are important for the Tories, since
they will help to set the stage for the elections to the European parliament
next year.
The government is concerned about a possible strong vote for Mr Ashdown's
party in the European elections, which might lay the groundwork for a
successful general election campaign.
Only as the bitter divisions within the Tory party over Maastricht have
moved out of the political spotlight have Conservative strategists felt it
safe to focus on European policy.
Special responsibility for the campaign against the Liberal Democrats will
go to Mr Patrick Nicholls, a party vice-chairmen.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Mercury steps up mobile phones battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a mass consumer market for cellular phones came closer
yesterday with the launch of Mercury's One-2-One network.
One-2-One, the third national cellular network, offered free local calls in
the evenings and at weekends as the centrepiece of an aggressive Pounds 10m
campaign.
The network is available only in the London area, but it is planned to cover
most of the UK by early 1996. A joint venture between Cable and Wireless and
US West, One-2-One is a high-capacity digital network.
Lord Young, Cable and Wireless chairman, said the 'main target' of One-2-One
was British Telecommunications. But with peak-rate tariffs and rental and
handset prices several times higher than BT's, competition is likely to be
felt most by the existing mobile operators, Vodafone and Cellnet.
BT said One-2-One was not a replacement for fixed-line phones. Mr Ian Ash,
BT's marketing director, said: 'Apart from a marketing ploy for cheap-rate
local calls, every other call will cost markedly more than BT's'
Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's director of corporate affairs, said the company
would not react with further cuts. 'Competition has got to be seen to work.
If we reacted, we could kill them.'
One-2-One has spent about Pounds 150m on the first phase of its network, and
expects to be profitable within four to five years. Its focus on the private
consumer market is a new departure for the eight-year-old cellular industry,
most of whose 1.7m customers are business users.
Free off-peak local calls are available only on One-2-One's 'PersonalCall'
tariff, after 7pm on weekdays or at weekends. A Pounds 20 connection fee and
Pounds 12.50 monthly subscription are payable (excluding VAT). Calls before
7pm cost 25p a minute, off-peak national calls 10p.
A separate business tariff has a higher monthly subscription (Pounds 20) and
an 8p a minute charge for all off-peak calls, but a lower peak-rate charge
of 16p a minute. Handsets for the new digital network are retailing at
Pounds 250-Pounds 300.
The City views One-2-One as a serious challenger in the cellular market. Mr
Bryan Van Dussen, analyst at the Yankee Group, said: 'It changes the ball
game entirely. Until now Cellnet and Vodafone have stressed their national
coverage, but the special tariff changes play to Mercury's strength as a
local operator.'
Five years ago, the UK had fewer than 200,000 mobile subscribers. Analysts
expect the number to rise to more than 6m by 2000. The Telecommunications
Users Association said One-2-One marked 'a new era in mobile
communications'.

Rightwing ministers are said to be planning to use the political meeting
after cabinet tomorrow to ensure a discussion on tax and spending. The
meeting - at which officials are not present - gives the right another
opportunity to emphasise opposition to tax increases as a way of reducing
the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement.

FT  08 SEP 93 / S&amp;P rate on Visa credit card undercuts rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the investment group, has launched a Visa card that
threatens to shake up the credit card market by charging a rate of interest
at least 7 percentage points less than most others.
Issuers of credit cards and store cards have come under increasing criticism
this year for charging rates often well in excess of 20 per cent when base
rates are 6 per cent. Issuers argue that the rate charged has to cover the
cost of processing payments, risk and fraud.
The rate of interest on Save &amp; Prosper's card is 1 per cent a month, an
annualised percentage rate (APR) of 14.6 per cent. That compares with a 22.9
per cent APR at Barclaycard, the largest issuer with 8.8m cards in issue,
and a 23.9 per cent APR at National Westminster bank, which has 4m cards.
Mr Ian Lindsey, the S&amp;P director responsible for banking services, said: 'We
believe that the high street banks are overcharging their credit card
customers in order to compensate for the losses they are making on personal
current accounts.'
He denied that the S&amp;P rate had been pitched low to attract new customers,
and would be increased later.
S&amp;P has 100,000 cards in issue but hopes to double its market share. It is
raising its annual fee from Pounds 10 to Pounds 12 and, like the main
issuers, will charge interest from the transaction date rather than the
statement date for those who do not settle monthly bills in full.
The big issuers said yesterday that they would not be bringing down their
rates in response to S&amp;P's move. Barclaycard said it remained to be seen
whether the move was more than a marketing gimmick. It said its own card
offered a wider range of benefits and it believed S&amp;P's rate would be
difficult for a mass-market operator to sustain.
National Westminster said it doubted that S&amp;P would make much money if it
attracted customers who borrowed heavily.
The Consumers' Association said the launch of the new card was 'a
significant move'.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Uneasy return for Marcos's remains: Fears and hopes
accompanying the ex-dictator's body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN to the Philippines this week of the body of Mr Ferdinand Marcos,
the deposed dictator, could provide fuel for his old supporters to stoke up
disenchantment over a stagnant economy.
Mr Marcos's body is scheduled to be flown to his home province of Ilocos
Norte in the northern Philippines today. It will be put on display at a
newly constructed family mausoleum until burial rites on Friday.
The former president's only son, Ferdinand Jr, left Manila last Friday to
fetch the body from Hawaii, where it had been kept in a refrigerated crypt
since his death in September 1989. Mr Marcos's widow Imelda has been barred
by courts from leaving the Philippines.
Mr Marcos was forced out of the presidency in 1986 in a military-led revolt
against his administration. He fled with his family to Hawaii.
The dictator's fall swept into power Mrs Corazon Aquino, whose husband
Benigno, a charismatic opposition leader at the time, had been gunned down
in 1983 upon his return from a three-year exile in the US. Aquino family
members remain convinced that the Marcos government had a hand in the
slaying.
Mrs Aquino, during her presidency, had refused to allow the return of Mr
Marcos's remains.
Marcos supporters were involved in several armed attempts to overthrow her.
All were thwarted - due to a large extent to the support given to Mrs Aquino
by Mr Fidel Ramos, her armed forces chief of staff and later defence
secretary. Mr Ramos, who was also among the leaders who sided with the
military mutiny against Mr Marcos in 1986, is now president.
When Mr Marcos lies in state in his home town this week, his supporters are
hoping, apparently in vain, for a visit by Mr Ramos. They say that such a
visit befits someone who was not only a former head of state but also a
relative. Mr Ramos and Mr Marcos are distant cousins. Some argue that the
return of the body could aid a reconciliation among the country's disparate
ethnic and political factions, and remove a big stumbling block to sustained
economic progress, were Mr Ramos to pay his respects.
The people of Ilocos, known for their frugality and clannishness, are
regarded as a strong base for anybody with political ambitions. Commonly
referred to as the 'Solid North', the Ilocos region was a big asset in the
political machine of Mr Marcos.
Although the government does not plan to extend state honours at the
funeral, Mr Ramos has named four cabinet secretaries to a committee that
will help the Marcoses in the burial. His sister, Senator Leticia
Ramos-Shahani, will represent him at the funeral. Vice-president Joseph
Estrada will be the highest-ranking official present.
Mr Ramos has also allowed the use of a government building in Mr Marcos's
home town as a venue.
Throngs of Marcos admirers are expected to gather in Ilocos. Millions of
other Filipinos, however, still remember Mr Marcos as the president who
placed the country under martial law in 1972. He said then that communists
were threatening to destabilise the government. The era, however, came to be
known for the abuses perpetrated by the military and civilian leaders while
the economy, at the time the most prosperous in Asia after Japan's,
deteriorated steadily.
By the early 1980s the economies of virtually all of the country's
neighbours were booming while the number of Filipinos living below the
poverty line swelled.
The country is still trying to extricate itself from the economic shambles
that Mr Marcos left behind.

A HOLDING company owned by around 300 private-sector Germany banks is
offering DM120m (Dollars 75m) to buy five companies in eastern Germany from
the Treuhand, the government agency responsible for privatising industry in
the new federal states.
The Association of German Banks said yesterday BNL-Beteiligungsgesellschaft
was making the offer for the companies as part of the banking sector's
commitment to invest DM400m in eastern Germany.
The pledge was made under the 'solidarity pact' between government, industry

FT  07 SEP 93 / French to reform pay-TV and cable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is considering plans to forge closer links between
Canal-Plus, the successful pay-TV channel, and the struggling cable
television network, as part of its forthcoming broadcasting reforms.
Mr Alain Carignon, communications minister, told Les Echos, the French
financial newspaper, that the reforms could include the sale of Canal-Plus
as part of a package including cable channels in an attempt to boost cable
subscriptions.
At present Canal-Plus, which offers a mix of films and sport, is sold
separately from cable. Since its 1985 launch it has become one of France's
most dynamic channels, with 3.6m subscribers at the end of last year. The
cable system, by contrast, has attracted only 1m subscribers and is burdened
by heavy losses. Some observers suspect that Canal-Plus's success and its
popularity with viewers has made life even more difficult for the cable
companies.
The original franchise for Canal-Plus, whose chairman, Mr Andre Rousselet,
is a close friend of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president, comes
up for renewal at the end of 1995. The new centre-right government will in
December present its proposals for the new franchise.
Mr Carignon told Les Echos that Canal-Plus should benefit from his plans to
change the franchise system so that each licence lasts for five to six years
and is automatically renewable three times, provided the holders meet their
legal obligations.
As a result, he said, the pay-TV channel should try to help cable's
development. Canal-Plus said it could not comment on the government's plans
as the situation was 'so delicate'. The reforms are also likely to include
proposals to raise the maximum size of shareholdings in television companies
from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.

FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and TOM FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bright property sector was enlivened by recommendations fom Kleinwort
Benson and SG Warburg, as well as some positive weekend press comment. Among
those doing well, British Land rose 5 to 385p, as did Land Securities, to
663p, while MEPC added 9 at 496p.
Press speculation that Ladbroke Group was considering floating its property
division caused little interest in the market. While the company was said to
be denying the move to analysts, many said they believed that such a
development would eventually find its way on to the company's debt-cutting
agenda, although not until next year. Ladbroke shares climbed a half-penny
to 210p.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, firmed 3 to 735p in the registered
ahead of first-half results due on Thursday. The group is forecast to
announce profits of Pounds 170m to Pounds 200m, up to 25 per cent ahead of
last year's as a result of improved productivity, acquisitions and currency
gains.
Royal Bank of Scotland continued to receive support from a broker's buy
recommendation on Friday, adding 4 at 292p. National Westminster was
restrained by speculation of a large preference share issue, but analysts
were sceptical and added that it would have little impact on the ordinary
shares, which closed a penny firmer at 481p.
Oil group Burmah was held back as investors digested last week's results and
decided that they were slightly more disappointing than the headline figure
suggested. The shares slipped 4 1/2 to 773p xd.
In spite of the Labor Day closure of the US markets, Enterprise Oil was
bought by US institutions operating in London and rose 6 to 494p .
The majors, Shell Transport and BP, were restrained by a weaker oil price
and ended slightly easier on balance at 665p and 307p respectively.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was held back by reports of a Japanese drug
found to be capable of inhibiting the death of cells infected by HIV, the
virus that causes Aids.
The drug will need to be tested in animals for at least two years before any
clinical trial can be considered so the drug is many years away from the
market. Wellcome is always vulnerable to negative sentiment from Aids
stories. The shares shed 9 at one stage and closed 5 off at 744p.
Glaxo improved 2 to 620p ahead of full-year results on Thursday, with volume
boosted by heavy activity in the traded options market. Analysts expect
about Pounds 1.66bn, up from Pounds 1.43bn in 1992, but there are some
worries that in the light of the new harsher climate for the drugs industry
the accompanying statement could encourage profit-taking.
Medeva advanced 5 to 123p xd as securities house Smith New Court repeated a
buy recommendation, arguing that the share price, which has halved since a
profits warning last month, was cheap. Also, word leaked out that French
owned SGST was preparing an enthusiastic piece of research.
Dealers pointed to a recommendation from a small broker aimed at private
clients as the reason behind strength in Enviromed, up 7 at 118p.
Whispers of a big rights issue ahead of Cadbury Schweppes' results on
Thursday were being heard. Analysts said that while such an event would not
be surprising, similar talk has been well aired in the past. The shares
gained 2 at 476p.
Shares in shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft were in demand after it announced a
further order from Qatar to provide spares, maintenance and training for
four fast strike craft which it ordered from Vosper last year. They rose 12
to 674p.
Vague talk that GKN was taking a look at Westland, in which it has a stake,
was heard, although analysts dismissed suggestions of a takeover. GKN closed
at 488p xd and the latter put on 8 at 244p.
A positive annual meeting held by engineering group Siebe boosted the stock,
the shares gaining 9 to 541p.
Figures released at the weekend showing a sharp increase in UK car sales
boosted several stocks in the motor sector. These included distributor
Bletchley, where the shares jumped 25 to 335p, ahead of Friday's interim
figures; Dagenham Motor, which hardened 3 to 139p; and Pendragon, 5 better
at 283p.
Steel group ASW Holdings fell 10 to 214p after it reported interim figures
below market expectations, inspite of returning to profit. Half-time figures
came in at Pounds 1.5m against a loss of Pounds 2.1m last time. Brokers
moved to downgrade full-year expectations following the figures, with Smith
New Court reducing its forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m.
Conglomerate Suter cheered the market by reporting bumper profits and the
shares hardened 4 to 184p.
Birkby, the property and vehicle hire company, rose 6 to 190p and Cosalt,
the manufacturer and supplier, was lifted 13 to 130p. Dealers said a bear
squeeze was responsible for pushing both stocks higher. Birkby received
additional support from the property market's recent good run.
Elsewhere, food maufacturing issues were mostly positive, with Hoare Govett
advising clients to switch out of capital goods stocks and to go overweight
in the sector. Nervousness ahead of results today pulled down Hillsdown, off
3 at 165p.
Publisher Harrington Kilbride jumped 16 to 250p ahead of interim results
today. Meanwhile Haynes, the publisher of technical manuals, leapt 37 to
455p after a boost in profits to Pounds 3.95m and a confident statement from
the chairman.

A pre-results recommendation sent insurer Legal &amp; General higher yesterday
at the expense of Prudential. Securities house UBS repeated its
recommendation to switch out of the Pru, which publishes interim figures
tomorrow, and into L&amp;G, which announces its profits next Thursday.
UBS is cautious on the life sector after the recent announcement by the
Office of Fair Trading on disclosure of commissions. However, it feels that
L&amp;G offers the best value and forecasts interim profits of Pounds 78m,
against Pounds 74m last time. It predicts profits of Pounds 250m for
Prudential against Pounds 249m previously. L&amp;G gained 8 at 476p while
Prudential put on a penny at 337p.

FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Surprise at Thorn disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and TOM FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURPRISE among leisure analysts over how Thorn EMI chose to deliver what was
seen as a subtle profits warning hung over the shares yesterday. The
possibility of an official inquiry was under consideration by London Stock
Exchange officials last night.
Thorn shares had opened sharply down yesterday as SG Warburg, the company's
broker, lopped Pounds 18m off its profits forecast. The broker was reacting
to a letter sent by Thorn to shareholders on Friday  - and lodged with the
Stock Exchange that day - detailing the sale of the group's lighting
division. However, at the end of the letter Thorn warns that profits from
its security and electronics business are unlikely to be greater than 1992's
Pounds 1.5m. Analysts had pencilled in Pounds 15m profits for 1993.
But with the exception of Warburg, no other broker seems to have received a
copy of the circular until after the market opened yesterday, following
which a swathe of downgrades hit the stock. Profits are believed to have
been hit by the deferment of certain defence contracts. GEC broke off
negotiations a month ago over buying the defence side of Thorn's electronics
business.
Last night a spokesman for Thorn said: 'I can understand the consternation
among some analysts - however, this was not a profits warning but an updated
trading statement.' He added that additional information of the bright start
made by the music and rental divisions bore this out. He also pointed out
that a statement from the Exchange on Friday said the official letter
referring to the lighting division was available at the Exchange, and that
copies were available from the company or its broker. Thorn shares finished
yesterday's session 21 down at 983p. Turnover was a healthy 1.8m.

<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATION was the keynote of yesterday's trading in the derivatives
sector, with dealers unwilling to commit themselves to taking large
positions ahead of a week of results from some of the market's biggest
companies, writes Joel Kibazo.
Early strength in the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which saw it
advance 6 points to 3,070 within the first hour of trading, petered out as
dealers turned more cautious about the outlook on the corporate results
front. Sporadic buying was seen from a number of independent traders. Others
simply chose to extend the run of profit-taking into a fifth consecutive
session, with the absence of a lead from Wall Street, closed for Labour Day,
doing little to boost sentiment.
September ended the session at 3,063, some 5 points below Friday's close and
at an 8-point premium to the underlying cash market. As the life of the
September contract draws to a close, fair value, the premium which allows
for dividend flow and financing costs on the underlying Footsie stocks, now
stands at zero.
Volume in September was a mere 6,738 lots, with dealers reporting the
rolling forward into December of around 2,000 contracts. The closing volume
in that contract was 2,074.
Traded options were dull, turnover falling to 20,142 contracts from Friday's
30,948. Glaxo was the top stock option at 1,324 lots dealt.

FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: UK equities steady in sluggish trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON stock market lacking a lead from either Wall Street or the UK bond
market held steady yesterday as the new equity trading account opened. There
was little sign of selling pressure but investors were cautious ahead of
this week's heavy list of trading statements from British companies, which
will include Glaxo, British Gas, Fisons and RTZ.
The FT-SE 100 Index moved within a narrow margin, gaining 2.4 and then
falling by 7.6 from Friday's close before ending 1.7 up on the day at 3,059.
'It was really a nothing day,' admitted the head trader at a leading
securities firm.
Wall Street's closure for Labor Day left London traders to wait for further
clues as to the precise direction of US fund investment towards European
stock markets. Some US securities analysts have advised clients to look to
Germany and France for short term equity growth. UK investors hope that the
Bundesbank will cut rates soon, perhaps on Thursday.
A slight fall in domestic consumer borrowing in July did nothing to damage
confidence in the progress of economic recovery, which was encouraged by an
optimistic report from the Institute of Directors (IOD). The Institute's
bi-monthly survey said that 65 per cent of members were 'more optimistic'
about the UK economy, and the IOD said this provided 'clear evidence' that
recovery is on track.
Sluggish trading was borne out by a sharp fall in equity turnover as
reported through the Seaq electronic network; Seaq volume fell from
Thursday's 727.4m shares to only 421.1m yesterday, with non-Footsie business
making up about 66 per cent of the day's total.
Retail, or customer, business, which is a sounder guide to underlying
investment trends than the daily Seaq reported figure which does not
distinguish between intra-market and customer investment deals, remained
strong on Friday, recording a total worth of Pounds 1.49bn. This followed
daily totals of Pounds 1.73bn, Pounds 1.45bn and Pounds 1.06bn earlier in
the week.
There was an end-of-summer mood in the stock market which is aware that the
coming months could provide it with new tests of confidence. The impending
flow of corporate results will be scanned, not just for profits
performances, but for evidence of the recovery in the economy.
October has already been dubbed 'the worry month' in the market which also
realises that November will bring further nervousness ahead of the autumn
budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer.
However, while many analysts appeared prepared to admit that some form of
market correction is likely this month, there were few sellers in the market
yesterday. Sector analysts were very busy, urging clients to shuffle
portfolios away from the capital goods stocks which have led the market
ahead and into the consumer-orientated issues which are expected to respond
with increasing strength if evidence of economic recovery accumulates.
The pharmaceutical and oil stock sectors which have attracted good US
interest recently, lay calm yesterday as investors waited for Wall Street to
return to business. But the domestic consumer issues were firmer, albeit in
modest trading.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities up 3.9 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN shares finished 3.9 per cent higher following light trading as
investors continued to buy telecom, utility and steel sectors.
The Bovespa index moved ahead 440 to 11,618.
State power utilities were strong on hopes that the sector will be the next
one to be privatised. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister,
said in a recent interview that he would announce changes to the
privatisation programme later this month. Analysts expect the minister to
include the government's outstanding social security debts as a means of
payment in the privatisation auctions.
Mr Cardoso has also said that he is planning to accept outstanding debt owed
by the federal government to the electrical firms (CRC) in the privatisation
auctions of the sector.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe, Pacific Rim markets break
records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plenty of records were broken last week, particularly among markets on the
Pacific Rim, while special situations boosted activity in Tokyo.
In continental Europe records were set on Tuesday in Germany, France and the
Netherlands, although activity weakened thereafter, leaving the FT-Actuaries
European component of the World index down almost 1 per cent on the week.
The World index gained 0.5 percentage points in local currency terms last
week.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe comments that the French equity market
has risen by 17.5 per cent in the last three months, and is selling on a p/e
of 23.9 times 1993 earnings, compared with 15.7 times for the UK and 26
times for Germany.
He adds that 'US investors remain overweight in French equities, but the
domestic press is increasingly uneasy about the level of the market in the
absence of an interest rate cut'.
Indeed, the absence of a rate cut in France was one reason for the decline
in the market, as some investors had been hoping for the Bank of France to
make an announcement as early as last Monday. Another contribution to the
fall back in Paris was a spate of disappointing interims from, among others,
Elf Aquitaine, Rhone Poulenc and Club Med.
This Thursday sees another Buba meeting, and the markets will he hoping for
a slight easing in interest rates. The UBS Global research team are not
alone in forecasting a cut of 50 basis points in official rates on Thursday.
'While German domestic monetary conditions have hardly changed dramatically
since the last (Buba) meeting, the D-Mark's strength and Mr Otmar Issing's
soothing message on inflation will tip the balance in favour of an easing
move,' writes UBS in their latest strategy document.
The research team at UBS also notes that 'those inclined to abandon the
turmoil of Europe and switch into Japan would be wise to note that in dollar
terms Japan has risen 50 per cent this year, and Europe less than 20 per
cent'.
If monetary easing is accelerated, they add, then European markets are
likely to advance whereas Japan's upside is limited.
Spain was one of the world's worst performing markets last week: after
seeing a record high on Monday, the index retreated sharply over the next
four days and did not respond at all to Friday's interest rate cut.
In Asia there was an impressive performance from Malaysian equities, while
Singapore also hit a succession of record highs during the week.
The recent dynamism of Malaysia has as much to do with the impressive
strength of the economy - 1993 GDP growth forecast at 8.6 per cent and
inflation expected to fall from 4.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent by the end of
1994 - as with high liquidity and expectations of sharp falls in interest
rates.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixture of responses to
absence of Wall St
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bourses traded moderately in the absence of Wall Street yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM saw Volvo Bs fall SKr7 to SKr483 after the announcement of its
merger with Renault, the French car group. The shares had been suspended for
most of the day ahead of the long-awaited announcement and were only traded
in the last 45 minutes of the session and initially gained ground to SKr500,
a year's high.
The Affarsvarlden general index closed up 8.00 at 1,290.7 in turnover of
SKr1bn.
FRANKFURT lost a lot of ground on the weaker dollar, with the DAX index
shedding 14.88 to 1,910.28 in turnover down to DM5.3bn from Friday's
DM8.6bn.
Among those sectors suffering were cars, chemicals, and steel. Volkswagen,
lost DM7.70 or 2 per cent to DM372.00 in reaction to weekend news of losses
at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary.
Banks remained resilient to deeper weakness: Deutsche off DM4.50 at
DM783.00, Commerzbank down DM2.50 at DM316.50 and Dresdner off 50 pfgs at
DM419.
Daiwa's research team has recently rated the European banking sector a hold
given good double digit profit growth in 1993 and further improvement
expected in 1994.
PARIS closed slightly higher in subdued trading. The CAC-40 index added 1.87
to 2,157.96 in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Among the day's gainers was Carrefour up FFr55 at FFr3,080 as the group,
reporting first half figures, said that it expected a rise in full year
profits.
MILAN was dominated by profit-taking pressure on Fiat and the Comit index
shed 12.05 or 1.9 per cent to 616.90.
Fiat fell L338 or 4.9 per cent to L6,587. Analysts attributed the decline to
futures-related trading ahead of Friday's options expiry, continuing
speculation of a large capital rise, and disappointment at the absence of an
announcement by the end of August to resolve the long running speculation
about an international alliance or asset sale.
Mediobanca shed L617 to L17,298 with news of its call to investors for fresh
funds coming late in the day.
Against the trend Ferruzzi rose L34 to L374.5 amid talk of stake building
ahead of the announcement, expected later this month, of a rescue package
being put together by creditors.
ZURICH succumbed to a round of profit-taking which left the SMI index 42.6
or 1.9 per cent lower at 2,392.2.
Virtually all the recent strong performers were affected. Roche certificates
shed SFr115 to SFr4,490 while Nestle ended SFr14 lower at SFr1,063.
Bank shares were lower but off their worst for the day. UBS fell SFr28 to
SFr1,127, CS Holding SFr65 to SFr2,830 and SBC SFr10 to SFr452. Smith New
Court in London notes that while the stocks have performed strongly in
recent months, they are currently no more expensive than they were a year
ago following recent result-led earnings upgrades.
BRUSSELS fell back on profit-taking after strong gains on Friday when the
market gained ground on expectations of an imminent devaluation of the
currency. The Bel-20 index closed down 9.12 at 1,341.52 in turnover estimate
at BFr1.6bn.
AMSTERDAM closed moderately lower, the CBS Tendency index off 0.4 at 127.3
with Ahold down Fl 1.50 at Fl 93.00 ahead of today's second quarter figures.
WARSAW stocks leapt by their daily 10 per cent limit as the WIG index jumped
667.2 or 9.7 per cent to 7,561 in record turnover of 1,350bn zloty.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Singapore sees fourth
consecutive all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Tokyo
PRICES were depressed by some late institutional selling and the Nikkei
average lost some ground after its advances of the previous two sessions,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which hit a high for the year on Friday, fell 55.40
to 21,060.81. Growing hopes of a cut in the official discount rate pushed
the index up to the day's high of 21,249.92 in the morning session. However,
it fell back during the final hour of trading, registering the day's low of
21,055.91 just before the close.
Volume totalled 250m shares, against 471m. Overall rises held a narrow lead
over declines by 499 to 472, with 220 issues unchanged, but the Topix index
of all first section stocks shed 1.76 to 1,696.91. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index firmed 1.90 to 1,301.44.
Weekend reports of an imminent discount rate cut prompted arbitrage buying
while purchases by overseas investors supported prices. However, domestic
institutions, including life assurers and corporations, took profits.
Traders said that many investors remained on the sidelines ahead of the Bank
of Japan's tankan, or the quarterly report on business sentiment, which is
scheduled to be released on Friday and is expected to be followed by an
easing of monetary policy.
Pharmaceuticals and bio-technology-related issues were popular ahead of a
spate of medical conferences. Sankyo, the most active issue of the day, rose
Y10 to Y2,860 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical gained Y20 to Y1,730.
Food shares were also higher with Ajinomoto adding Y30 to Y1,470 and Kirin
Brewery up Y30 to Y1,290.
Banks faced profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,540 and
Mitsubishi Bank fell Y30 to Y2,940. Profit-taking also hit high-technology
issues. Toshiba fell Y6 to Y707 and Olympus Optical lost Y100 to Y1,180.
DDI, the long distance telecom company which listed on the second section of
the Tokyo stock exchange, rose Y420,000 to Y5.8m. However, Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, fell for the third consecutive day, losing Y6,000 to
Y949,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 24.70 to 23,060 in volume of 24m shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim saw some positive performances.
SINGAPORE continued its record-setting run, the Straits Times Industrial
index adding 3.69 for a fourth consecutive closing high of 2,045.36. Late
profit-taking had brought the index back from an intra-day record 2,055.59.
HONG KONG erased morning losses and closed slightly higher, shrugging off
renewed signs of friction between China and Britain. However, trade was
sluggish and the Hang Seng index ended 7.53 higher at 7,519.66, after
falling around 30 points earlier. Turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.96bn.
Overseas demand for Hutchison lifted the stock by 20 cents to HKDollars
24.30, while HSBC Holding held steady at HKDollars 82.50 after late buying
erased an early decline of 50 cents.
AUSTRALIA picked up after Friday's fall, helped by a more stable local
currency and some renewed foreign demand. The All Ordinaries index closed
10.5 ahead at 1,962.5 in light turnover of ADollars 267m. News Corp was 36
cents stronger at ADollars 10.56, after ADollars 10.64, while BHP rose 20
cents to ADollars 16.
BOMBAY was hit by a new crisis triggered by fallout from the year-old
securities scandal and the BSE-30 index fell 42.86 to 2,621.20. Prices fell
after the income tax authorities said they had confiscated a large number of
shares of Associated Cement which a broker had placed with proxies.
TAIWAN closed at a six-month low in sluggish trade as hopes faded for a
looser central bank monetary policy. The weighted index slumped 40.76 to
3,815.54.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Israel soars on peace prospects - The
rally in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli optimism about an imminent Middle East peace agreement, coupled with
favourable economic indicators, has sent stocks soaring on the Tel Aviv
stock exchange to record highs.
The Mishtanim 100 blue chip share index closed yesterday at 229.04 - up 1.9
per cent over Sunday's close, continuing an massive upward trend.
Since the revelation of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement eight days
ago the Mishtanim index has climbed nearly 28 points from 201.09 on Sunday
August 29, a cumulative increase of more than 13 per cent. The MOAF options
index of the leading 25 companies has climbed even higher during the same
period, up almost 34 points from 198.22 to 232.09 at yesterday's close, a
rise of 17 per cent.
The TASE has also experienced record volumes with trading on Sunday reaching
an all-time high of Shk410m. Mutual funds have been leading the trading
surge with huge stock purchases.
'What we are seeing is the reaction to the optimistic view of people in
Israel about the economic aspects about peace,' said Ms Hanna Pri-zan, the
head of Bank Hapoalim securities. 'The whole region is going to change.
'Although the market started in a little profit-taking yesterday, soon
people decided they want to be in, not out and they are ready to pay.'
Market analysts expect the surge to continue with a knock-on effect in the
medium and small companies in coming days.
Ms Pri-zan said investors, including foreign buyers, expected an imminent
economic dividend from the peace agreement in vastly expanded trade with
Arab countries, massive foreign investment in new projects and regional
integration in fields like tourism.
'People waited to get in the market until they were sure that Syria, Jordan
and the Gulf states were behind the peace process,' she said. 'If you go
through the sectors of the economy almost every field, except high
technology defence, is going to improve under peace - agriculture,
telecommunications, infrastructure - and it is possible that Israel will
become a financial sector for the Middle East.'
Apart from optimism about peace, the market is also responding, say
analysts, to expectations of higher economic growth in the last two quarters
of 1993 and falling interest rates. Investors also expect better corporate
results in the last two quarters of 1993, partly as a result of improvement
in the bond market in which many Israeli companies have invested heavily.
The market has also seen several extremely successful flotations of shares
in large companies, like the recent placing of 20 per cent of Bank Leumi.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Money Markets: D-Mark is ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rate dealers continued to take the view that the Bundesbank
would leave interest rates unchanged at this week's council meeting in spite
of the D-Mark's powerful performance against the dollar, writes James Blitz.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-elect, said recently that a
streng-thening D-Mark would be of concern to German exporters, given the
already dilapidated state of the European economy.
Worries about the D-Mark may have encouraged some dealers to take the view
that interest rates would come down this week, and the September Euromark
contract rose 2 basis points to 93.52.
But at this level, dealers are still expecting three-month D-Marks to be at
6.48 per cent when the contract matures in around a week's time. And that is
barely different from yesterday's D-Mark cash level of 6.53 per cent.
Some analysts believe that this week's meeting will be the last opportunity
for official rates to come down for six weeks. The meeting in 2 1/2 weeks'
time will be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last as Bundesbank president and the
one after that will be Mr Tietmeyer's first. Mr Adrian James, an economist
at NatWest Markets in London, said the central bank would probably not want
to change rates at either session.
In any case, none of the factors which could bring a cut are in place. Core
inflation is unlikely to come below 4 per cent until next month. New
agreements are still being negotiated on the German budget. And negotiations
are about to get under way on the next wage round.
Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets, believes all
these factors point to a cut of 50 basis points at either of the meetings on
October 21 or November 4 at the very earliest.
In London, the Bank of England again forecast a large daily shortage, this
time of Pounds 1.35bn. On this occasion, Pounds 1.1bn of the shortage was
removed in the early round of trading, bringing the overnight rate down to a
low of 4 per cent.
Sterling interest rate futures were depressed by another poor performance
from the currency. The September short sterling contract declined 2 basis
points to close at 94.08. The December contract fell 5 basis points to
94.44.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/D-Mark remains soft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued to come under pressure against the D-Mark yesterday,
falling by more than a pfennig, as dealers took the view that the Bundesbank
would not reduce its short-term interest rates later this week, writes James
Blitz.
The US currency is in the midst of a downtrend which has been triggered by
the Bundesbank's intransigence in keeping monetary policy tight and by new
signs of weakness in the US economy.
The fall has been striking. On Wednesday August 26, the dollar was trading
at DM1.6680 against the D-Mark, shortly before the Bundesbank decided to
keep its discount rate unchanged at its last council meeting.
Yesterday it closed in London at DM1.6120, after dropping from a previous
close of DM1.6225. The fall came in spite of the absence of the US on the
Labor Day holiday.
The D-Mark was partly boosted by good figures for industrial output in
western Germany for July, which showed a rise of 3.1 per cent, compared to a
fall of 1.4 per cent in June.
The figure also underlined that the Bundesbank need not be too concerned
about depressing the German economy if it keeps policy unchanged on
Thursday.
Mr Brian Martin, an economist at Citibank in London, believes that the data
coming out in the US this week are likely to underline the weakness that was
seen in the non-farm payroll figures last Friday. He believes that the Tan
Book and the producer prices figures for August will show that the economy
is not recovering quickly.
Those who have always been pessimistic about the dollar/ D-Mark rate are
getting more so. Mr Marc Hendriks, head of interest rate research at Swiss
Banking Corporation in London, believes that the dollar could find itself in
a DM1.55 to DM1.58 trading range within the next four weeks - and perhaps
even by next Monday. But he thinks little will now happen to the US currency
until the Bund-esbank meeting on Thursday.
The dollar was weaker against the yen, closing at Y104.20 from a previous
Y105.00. But the mood among investors was more optimistic than the exchange
rate move would suggest.
There were signs yesterday that the US and Japan were planning a plenary
meeting in Washington on Thursday at which the framework for a new
partnership could be worked out. The yen has made considerable ground in the
past, as dealers have taken the view that the US sought a strong Japanese
currency to reduce Tokyo's trade surplus.
In Europe, the French franc appreciated marginally to a close of FFr3.523 to
the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.525. The Belgian franc recovered to finish
at BFr21.62 per D-Mark from a previous BFr21.77. Sterling came under sharp
pressure, falling to DM2.4625 from a previous DM2.4775.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard to seek co-operation
on 'fragile' south Atlantic fisheries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS GILLIAN Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, yesterday stressed the
need for co-operation in protecting 'fragile' South Atlantic fish stocks as
she prepared to become only the third British cabinet minister to visit
Argentina since the Falklands conflict 11 years ago.
Relations between the two countries were soured again last May when Britain
decided to extend territorial waters to 200 miles around South Georgia and
the South Sandwich Islands, neighbours of the Falklands, and to introduce a
fishing licence system there to halt overfishing by third countries.
Argentina claims sovereignty over the two islands, as well as the Falklands,
where Britain has operated similar restrictions since 1987. Last year
Argentina introduced a cut-price licensing system for vessels operating in
its waters which has poached many of the Falklands' best customers.
Mrs Shephard said yesterday, on the eve of a week-long trade promotion trip
to three south American countries, that there had been discussions on the
issue of fishing limits at European Community level, with Spain particularly
interested in fishing for squid and hake in the South Atlantic. 'We need
agreement between the respective authorities to conserve fish for the mutual
benefit of all parties,' she said. 'Fish stocks there are fragile and
limited.'
She will also urge Argentina to lift its ban on imports of British cattle
for breeding purposes. Argentina is one of the 17 countries that still ban
cattle imports because of the 'mad cow disease' outbreak in the 1980s.
Mrs Shephard said the Paris-based Office International des Epizooties, the
international animal health organisation, had agreed there was no longer any
problem with British cattle exports.
Her visit to Argentina, accompanied by a team of British businessmen and
agricultural experts, follows separate trips by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade,
earlier this year.
Her first stop today will be Paraguay, where she expects to meet Mr Juan
Carlos Wasmosy, the first freely elected civilian president. She will then
visit Uruguay and lastly Argentina.
The objectives of the trip are to promote British food and drink, as well as
agricultural expertise and machinery.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber growers may cut output
to boost prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVEN major rubber producing countries - representing 90 per cent of the
world's output - say they could resort to cutting production to boost prices
if consumers refuse to revamp the present price support scheme, which lapses
at the end of this year.
Ministers from the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries who met
in Bangkok yesterday refused, however, to reveal exactly how they planned to
pressure consumers into lifting rubber prices from 30 year lows in real
terms.
Malaysia's minister of primary industries Dato Seri Dr Lim Kheng Yaik said:
'Don't ask us to expose our cards but rubber can very easily be kept in the
trees. I can tell you that.'
The producers complain that the current International Natural Rubber
Agreement's intervention fund, set up in 1979, to which both producers and
consumers contribute, tends to stabilise prices at low levels.
Their problem is that global economic recession and poor sales of cars, and
hence tyres, is keeping rubber prices low.
Yesterday Dr Lim stressed that 'rubber is certainly not a sunset industry.
As long as there are cars on the road there will be a demand for rubber'.
But he went on to say 'we have to do something to help ourselves. . . where
there is more production than demand we can expect prices to stay low for a
long, long, time'.
Malaysia has already lowered its production by about 350,000 tonnes - from
1.6m tonnes in 1988 to 1.25m tonnes in 1993.
The seven producers said they would 'take a long hard look whether they
wanted to be members' of the International Natural Rubber Organisation,
which groups producers and over 20 consumers, if their demands were not met.
They are working on a strategy of revamping the intervention fund and
co-ordinating production and marketing of rubber and other commodities.
Thailand's deputy minister of agriculture, Mr Suthep Thaugsuban, said they
expected a response from consumers - led by the US, the European Community
and Japan - this year and final agreement, if possible, next year;
indicating that they might be prepared to see the current Inra rolled over
for one more year.
A communique issued by the producers said the International Natural Rubber
Agreement needs to be 'reviewed and updated' and called for 'intensified'
negotiations between producers and consumers.
Consuming countries have repeatedly complained that producers are reluctant
to face market forces and allow the intervention fund manager to lower his
floor price.
After some acrimony earlier this year the floor price was lowered from 176
Malaysia/Singapore cents a kilogram to 166 cents. Even so the buffer stock
manager, who already had 180,000 tonnes in hand, said he bought for the
first time this year only on Friday when the price drifted below 165 cents.
Natural rubber production in Malaysia fell 11 per cent to 86,323 tonnes in
June, compared with the same month last year, the statistics department
said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Production for the first six months of the year was 537,480 tonnes, 4 per
cent lower than in the same 1992 period.
Malaysia exported 66,452 tonnes of rubber in June, down 13 per cent from a
year ago and 11 per cent less than in May.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protection puts Peru's vicuna
more at risk - With economic exploitation banned the field is open to
rustlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANNING the economic exploitation of endangered species has traditionally
been seen as the most effective method of protection. But that strategy is
not working for the vicuna, South America's graceful, shy camelid.
Officially classified as endangered, the herds of vicuna that roam the high
and lonely Peruvian Andes are increasingly falling prey to well-organised
gangs of international rustlers - and the cash-strapped government can do
little to counter their hit-and-run tactics.
No one knows quite the extent of the illegal trade. 'But it's very lucrative
and the organisation is sophisticated,' says Mr Domingo Hoces, an expert
with Conacs, Peru's relatively new quasi-governmental agency for camelids.
'There are brigades of well-armed hunters working for brokers within Latin
America who then ship the fibre in bales to Europe and Asia.'
One animal yields only about 200 grams of the coveted, soft hair, so five
rustled animals may die to produce a metre of cloth which, on the European
or Asian black market, can sell for anything between Dollars 1,500 and
Dollars 3,000.
The answer to the rustlers, say both Conacs officials and businessmen
interested in buying the valuable vicuna fibre, lies in the rational
exploitation of the animal. If the peasant farmers who are presently charged
by law with protecting the animals, which roam wild over their
communally-owned territories, are permitted to benefit from the eventual
sale of pricy vicuna cloth, goes the argument, both protection and husbandry
are certain to improve - and the wretchedly poor Andean peasants would be
better off.
International aid agencies have, over the years, run pilot programmes in the
vast Pampa Galeras high plateau in Ayacucho department, home to Peru's
largest concentrations of vicuna herds. They have taught peasant farmers
periodically to round up and shear the animals - though hair may be clipped
from the same animal only every two or three years.
The vicuna is native to the Andean countries of Peru and Bolivia, and, to a
lesser extent to Chile, Argentina and, more recently under a re-settlement
scheme, Ecuador. Hardy and resistant to the extreme cold, it inhabits the
inhospitable highlands between 3,700m and 4,800m above sea level.
Historically coveted for its especially fine hair, the vicuna was protected
and periodically culled by the Incas but later, during the colonial and
independence periods, indiscriminately hunted almost to extinction.
Agreements on protection between Bolivia and Peru in the late 1960s were
later extended to include Chile, Argentina and Ecuador. The protection
strategy worked and the Andean vicuna population is now estimated at 160,000
or more, 65 per cent of them in Peru.
Now that the species no longer faces the threat of extinction and herd sizes
are stable, sustainable utilisation would appear to be indicated. Six years
ago Cites, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,
authorised selective exploitation of the live-shorn vicuna. But, so far, the
interested parties have failed to reach consensus.
Several rival companies specialising in luxury fibres have been in Peru in
recent months hoping to expedite an agreement. One of them is a consortium
formed by UK-based Dawson International and Italy's Ermenegildo Zegna.
An immediate stumbling-block to a deal between international business and
the Andean peasants is price. 'There's been an irresponsible raising of
expectations,' says Mr Nick Kuenssberg, CEO of Dawson Premier Brands, who
visited Peru in early June to act as broker between Conacs and the
'comuneros'.
Although there is obviously no current reference price for vicuna hair, Mr
Kuenssberg says that its fineness and rarity mean it could 'reasonably
command four to five times the price of cashmere'. That would mean perhaps
Dollars 250 a kilogram for dehaired fibre. But the comuneros, having heard
that vicuna cloth retails on the black market for Dollars 3,000 a metre,
think they should receive four times that.
The 1987 Cites amendment permits marketing of cloth woven from vicuna hair,
but not the hair itself. Trials have been run by a textile company in Peru
and some 600 metres of vicuna cloth are now stockpiled in Lima, unsold,
along with 3,000kg of hair.
Ms Soledad Yoshimoto, president of Conacs, favours shipping the valuable
hair for spinning and weaving abroad. 'Foreign companies have the technology
which is not yet available here,' she says. 'When we launch vicuna on the
international market, we must ensure we are selling the best possible
product.'
The Dawson International-Zegna consortium is proposing spinning the cloth in
Britain, offering the comuneros a royalty on its eventual retail price.
But they say that Conacs must allow then to negotiate directly with the
comuneros, who should be formed into an appropriate association holding the
right to the 'Vicunandes' trademark which is demanded by Cites to identify
cloth spun from hair legally collected from live animals.
Experts estimate that immediate supply could be between one and three tonnes
of hair a year, rising as husbandry and shearing methods improve to perhaps
15 tonnes a year from the whole Andean region.
But the legal and bureaucratic obstacles remain. Cites is emphasising its
condition that only cloth, not fibre, may be sold. Conacs wants to maintain
an intermediary role between the peasant farmers and the international
cloth-makers. And businessmen need a mechanism by which they can contract a
reliable supply of raw material directly from the Andean farmers.
A solution is needed that will ensure the healthy survival of the species,
an attractive product for the well-heeled consumer and an improved standard
of living for many impoverished Andean peasants. Until it is found, illegal
hunting of the vicuna will continue inexorably.

HUNGARY HARVESTED 4.38m tonnes of cereals this year, 20 per cent down from
last year, according to figures released by the Central Statistical Office,
reports Reuter from Budapest.
Cereals were sown on about 1.54m hectares (3.8m acres) of land, 7 per cent
more than the area planted in 1992, but the harvest was smaller, mainly as a
result of widespread and protracted drought, the CSO said.
'One must mention drought as the primary reason for the drop. . . but losses
were also increased by inadequate agrotechnical work,' it said.
'Due to a shortage of money the necessary plant protection and fertilising
work was also not performed.' it said.
Wheat output was 3.03m tonnes, half of the 1986-1990 average and 12 per cent
less than last year. The 3,060 kg/hectare average wheat yield was 25 per
cent below last year's.
The rye harvest was 112,000 tonnes, 16 per cent less than in 1992, and
average yield lagged behind last year's by just as much, the CSO said.
The sown area for barley was 10 per cent below last year's, but the harvest
was only 1.14m tonnes, one-third less than in 1992. The yield for autumn
barley was 3,270 kg/hectare, 1,100kg higher than for spring barley.
Oats output fell to 94,000 tonnes from 144,000 in 1992.

CHINA'S 1993 grain crop will fall nearly 10m tonnes from 1992's total of

Beijing.
The Economic Information Daily quoted the ministry as saying that grain
acreage this year had fallen by 20m mu (3m hectares or 7.4m acres) from the
1992 level.
The country's summer grain crop reached a record 108.067m tonnes this year,
up by 3.4m from the 1992 level, the ministry said.
The official press has been full of reports on the low rewards of growing
grain as against other, more profitable farm activities, and the rising
prices of the raw materials farmers need.

feedgrain glut
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS OF extra tonnes of grain may flood into European animal feed
markets from 1993 to 1995 and beyond because of poor weather for crops this
year and sharp falls in prices stemming from cuts in European Community
subsidies, analysts believe, reports Reuter from Amsterdam.
They estimate that between 2m and 4m additional tonnes of grain will be used
as animal fodder in the community in 1993, rising to between 7m and 9m a
year within three years.
'The main effect is going to be on imports of soyameal and tapioca,
particularly if high protein prices due to poor crop conditions in the US
are maintained,' one German analyst said.
He estimated about 10 per cent of annual EC imports of animal feeds, or 4m
to 5m tonnes of mainly soyameal, could be replaced by feed grain by the
1995-1996 July-June season.
Under new EC regulations the community's farmers are no longer able to sell
feed grain to public intervention stocks and a wet summer in northern Europe
has left large portions of the wheat crop only suitable for feed and not
bread making.
Grain prices had slumped by up to 25 per cent so far this year in comparison
with 1992 prices and the changes in EC laws implemented from July 1 were
expected to lead to further falls of about 5 per cent in 1994-95 and 5 per
cent in 1995-1996, analysts said.
'These price reductions are only rough estimates because they depend on
developments in the European monetary system - 'green rates' and
realignments,' one added.
The shift towards feed wheat has been most marked in animal feeds in
southern Germany, France, Spain and Italy and less so in the Netherlands and
northern Germany where easy access to the big North Sea ports makes soyameal
transport costs competitive.
'The proportion of grain in pig feed formulations has increased from between
3 to 5 per cent to about 10 to 15 per cent this year,' one Dutch analyst
said.

RECENT FLOODS triggered by heavy monsoon rains have resulted in the loss of
1m tonnes of foodgrain in Bangladesh, officials estimate, reports Reuter
from Dhakar.
They said the floods, which engulfed more than two-thirds of the country
between June and August, destroyed 600,000 acres of crops. The government
estimated the cost at Tk7bn (Dollars 175m).
'It is certainly a setback at this moment, when the country has just started
exporting grains,' one official said. Bangladesh recently exported 20,000
tonnes of rice to the US and offered to sell 50,000 tonnes to Sri Lanka. The
country produced nearly 20m tonnes of rice and wheat in 1992-93 (July-June).
Bangladesh, which receives more than Dollars 150m in international food aid
annually, still imports more than 1m tonnes of grains, mainly wheat. The
wheat is used to implement development projects under the country's
Food-for-Work programme.
The officials said the government would try to make up the crop losses by
increasing winter cultivation, which starts in November. Bangladesh had 1m
tonnes of grains in stock, they added.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Light seen at end of tunnel for
aluminium producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM market would move back into balance next year and prices rise
above the industry's break-even level again if there were further relatively
modest cuts in capacity and producers resisted the temptation to re-start
mothballed smelters, analysts suggest.
'Knock out another 300,000 tonnes (of annual capacity) and the aluminum
market next year could be quite good,' says Mr Stewart Spector of the New
York-based Spector Report consultancy organisation.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggests that, even if western imports of
Commonwealth of Independent States aluminium remain at about 1m tonnes a
year, 'the upturn in demand would still leave the west in considerable
supply deficit by 1995. Much will depend on western producers exercising
restraint. If they rush to restart the 1.4m tonnes of capacity temporarily
mothballed over the past two years, they will simply condemn themselves to
low prices'.
He points out in the latest Metals Report that the prolonged period of
depressed prices has caused a large number of new smelter projects to be
cancelled or postponed so there is little new capacity in the pipeline. 'A
marked resurgence in demand over the next three years could leave the west
in considerable supply deficit.'
The recent fresh cuts announced by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa)
and Reynolds Metals, the biggest and second-biggest US producers, which will
take another 356,000 tonnes of annual capacity out of production, are the
first in two years that will not be offset by new capacity coming on stream,
Mr MacMillan points out.
He urges producers not to restore any capacity until the aluminium price
reaches 65 cents a lb and suggests this will not occur until the second half
of 1994. 'While prices next year will be significantly higher than in 1993,
it will be 1995/96 before the industry enjoys the full benefit of rising
demand.' Billiton is forecasting an average London Metal Exchange aluminium
price of 53 cents a lb this year, rising to 62 cents next year and to 75
cents in 1995.
Both Billiton and Spector expect western aluminium output to fall next year.
Mr Spector suggests it could slip by 1.8 per cent from the 1993 forecast
level of 14.92m tonnes to 14.64m. He says it would then take only a 4 per
cent rise in demand for stocks to start falling and for prices to improve.
Mr Spector says that recent increases in LME, trader and producer stocks
were offset by a fall in unreported CIS metal of a grade too low to be
delivered to LME warehouses.

Technical pressure in the London Metal Exchange COPPER market was maintained
yesterday, with the backwardation (nearby premium) widening significantly.
While the three months position showed signs of reflecting the market's
bearish fundamentals, falling Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 1,949 a tonne, the
cash price continued to be bolstered by concern over a potential supply
squeeze and its premium widened to Dollars 58 at the close. At the London
bullion market the GOLD price closed just 10 cents up from the depressed
level at which it ended last week.

VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday announced
plans to raise NKr150m through a placing of 3m shares with institutional
investors, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo.
The issue is aimed at strengthening Vard's equity base and providing greater
financial flexibility. Vard's shares closed NKr1.50 higher at NKr53.50
yesterday on the news.
The issue is being arranged by Oslo-based Elcon Securities and DnB Fonds, a
unit of Den norske Bank. The shares are to be issued at NKr50 each.
Vard, which has total borrowings of around Dollars 220m, said the issue will
allow the group to meet debt maturities of Dollars 35m - Dollars 40m due
this autumn.
The company said that the fresh capital would allow a fruitful and
constructive discussion with creditors on how to go forward with the
refinancing.
News of the share issue follows the announcement last week that Mr Torstein
Hagen, the Norwegian investor, had built up a 7 per cent stake in Vard.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CME relaunches futures
contract on MMI index
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange hopes to give a new look to the 10-year old
Major Market Index futures contract when it relaunches the derivative on its
trading floor today.
Futures trading on the MMI, which tracks 20 of the most heavily capitalised
companies in the US, is being transferred to the CME from the Chicago Board
of Trade in a renewed marketing effort.
'The MMI futures contract is an undervalued asset with tremendous
potential,' said Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman. 'We have serval important
initiatives planned that will enhance the MMI as a tool to be used by
institutional investors to manage their assets and their risk.'
The MMI, designed to track movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is
licensed to the Chicago Exchange by the American Stock Exchange, which
trades options on the index. Interest in MMI futures has dwindled in recent
years, with daily volume falling to less than 800 contracts.
The CME has encouraged 35 pit traders to migrate from the CBoT to
participate in the MMI contract under a special membership programme.
In addition, the Amex will this Friday launch flexible options on the MMI in
New York as a means of attracting fresh trading interest.
In October, pending Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the Chicago
Stock Exchange plans to trade a 'Chicago basket' of the 20 blue chip stocks
in the index. This is aimed at encouraging institutional arbitrage between
the spot index and the derivative contracts.
The MMI expands the CME's range of existing equity index futures, which
include futures on the FTSE-100, the S&amp;P 500, the S&amp;P 400 midcap index, and
the Nikkei 225 Japanese stock index.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Minor setback for higher-yielding European
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER-yielding European bond markets suffered a minor setback yesterday,
after enjoying a period of strength, while France and Germany benefitted
from the re-evaluation. Markets proved somewhat volatile without the anchor
of the US Treasury market, which was closed due to the Labor Day holiday in
the US.
SPANISH bond prices slid  5/8 of a point, as investors began to wonder
whether the market's month-long rally had been overdone. Italian bonds also
suffered, but regained some ground as the lira recovered to end only  1/4
point lower.
GERMAN 10-year bonds rose about  1/4 point in moderate turnover, boosted by
the D-Mark's continuing strength on the foreign exchanges, which spurred
further buying from foreign investors.
The mark's continuing ascent also had some market participants betting on
another near-term cut in key interest rates by the Deutsche Bundesbank,
whose Central Bank Council is to meet Thursday.
The release of stronger than expected orders data did not dent the market's
bullish sentiment although they could be seen as an indication that the
economy is poised for recovery, said one trader. Western German
manufacturing orders rose 3.2 per cent in July from June, contrary to
forecasts of a small decline.
The Bundesbank's minor downward revision of July M3 money supply growth to
7.4% from 7.5% had little impact on bond prices. With August M3 expected to
have grown significantly due to heavy currency intervention, the July
revision was of relatively little importance, said a Frankfurt trader. In
the futures market, the September Bund future on Liffe closed at 98.77, up
0.20 points from Friday.
IN THE French bond market, the 10-year sector put on the strongest
performance, with the Matif's 10-year bond future rising about  1/2 a point.
The gains were partly due to technical buying after the bond future breached
resistance around 123.20. But some were also attributed to short-covering by
players who felt that last week's sell-off had been overdone.
Market sentiment remained bullish, underpinned by hopes of French rate cuts
in the not too distant future. Still, the Bank of France's decision to leave
money-market rates steady did not damp prices as no rate cut had been
expected as early as yesterday.
The very long end of the French bond market remained soggy, however, after
it dropped sharply Friday on heavy selling by a large US investor, said a
trader in London. Added to last week's issue of new 30-year bonds, that
weighed on the long end, causing the yield curve to steepen, he said.
GILT PRICES fell  1/4 point during the morning session, on the back of a
strong rise in car sales, then traded unchanged for much of the rest of the
day.
Suggestions of inflationary pressure stemming from economic recovery fuelled
interest in the index-linked sector, encouraging the Bank of England to
issue another Pounds 400m tranche of index-linked paper.
The December long gilt future on Liffe ended  9/32 lower.
THE JAPANESE government bond market gained about  1/4 point, as expectations
of an interest rate cut mounted. Three-month certificate of deposit rates
hit record lows of 2.65 per cent, suggesting that the market expects an
interest rate cut imminently.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy's global dollar bond offering
could top record Dollars 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market is limbering up for the Republic of Italy's
global dollar-denominated bond offering, which could well exceed the
previous record for a transaction of this kind.
The record is currently held by the Province of Ontario with its Dollars 3bn
global bond issue which was launched last January. At the start of August,
the Italian authorities indicated that their global offering might raise up
to Dollars 5bn.
Italy has filed a registration with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission to issue up to Dollars 10bn of bonds in the US market over the
next decade.
Officials from the Italian treasury were in London yesterday to gauge
investor opinion. The roadshow, which will also include the Far East and the
US, is scheduled to end on September 13 and the offering is expected to be
launched shortly afterwards.
Italian treasury officials declined to comment on the intended size of the
global offering but they said that they expected the bonds to have a
maturity of 10 years.
They added that the aims of the offering were to subject Italy's credit to
international scrutiny as well as to establish benchmarks for other Italian
companies wishing to tap the international market in the future.
Last January, the Italian authorities set an international borrowing
programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn for 1993. So far, they
have borrowed about Dollars 7.2bn through fixed-rate deals in D-Marks,
dollars, and yen as well as a floating-rate note dollar bond.
Syndicate managers said that the yield spread over US Treasuries which Italy
would have to pay would depend on the size of the issue. They believed that
investors would be willing to accept a spread of around 60 basis points for
an offering of up to Dollars 3bn.
However, some syndicate managers said Italy might have to pay a spread of up
to 65 basis points if it decided to raise well over Dollars 3bn. 'It is a
big deal so they will have to be careful,' said one syndicate manager.
Italy's global bond issue is expected to be followed rapidly by the Republic
of Portugal's global dollar offering. Since Portugal is only expected to
raise around Dollars 1bn, syndicate managers said the sovereign borrower was
likely to have to pay a spread over US Treasuries of between 40 and 50 basis
points.
There were only a few new issues in the international bond market yesterday.
Abbey National Treasury Services launched its second lira Eurobond issue in
little over a month, raising L200bn through a 10-year offering.
A spokesman at lead manager Deutsche Bank said yesterday's offering appeared
tightly priced compared with other recent lira Eurobond offerings. However,
he added that the pricing was offset by the fact that, unlike other lira
Eurobonds, this issue was not callable. The bonds were trading at 99.295 bid
in the afternoon, at full fees.
Elsewhere, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had
placed four Japanese electric power companies on on CreditWatch with
negative implications.
Of the four, the best-known in the international bond market is Tokyo
Electric Power Company which has a triple-A senior debt rating. About
Dollars 38bn of rated debt is affected.
The other three are Chubu Electric Power Company, which has a double-A plus
rating, and Chugoku Electric Power Company and Shikoku Electric Power
Company which both have a double-A rating.
S&amp;P said that its actions were based on the increasing likelihood that
electricity rates will be decreased and that flat sales and heavy capital
expenditure programmes will put pressure on operating margins.
The Jamaican government plans a USDollars 20m bearer bond issue, writes
Canute James in Kingston.
The bonds have a life of one year and carry a coupon of 7 1/2 cent. They
will be issued in denominations of Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 50,000, with a
minimum purchase of Dollars 10,000.
Officials said if the offer is successful, subsequent and larger issues will
be made. Foreign currency sales to commercial banks have declined in recent
weeks, leading to increased pressure on the Jamaican dollar, which has
depreciated by 17 per cent in the past three months.

<TEXT>
NORMANDY Poseidon, the Adelaide-based diversified mining house, yesterday
reported an after-tax profit of ADollars 48.4m (USDollars 32.2m) for the
year to end-June. This compared with ADollars 33.6m in the previous 12
months, writes Nikki Tait.
In addition, the company benefited from an abnormal gain of ADollars 9.8m,
related to various asset sales. This brought total after-tax profits to
ADollars 58.2m. Total operating revenue stood at ADollars 1.14bn (ADollars
876.5m). Earnings per share, before abnormal items, stood at 10.4 cents, up
53 per cent on the year.
The company said turnover and profits in the industrial minerals division
continued to improve, and diamond production reached record levels, at 1.16m
carats.
The Poseidon Gold unit - in which Normandy Poseidon holds a majority
interest - reported an after-tax profit of ADollars 71.4m, against ADollars
49.1m in 1991-2. The average gold price realised was Dollars 585 per ounce.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Australian Woolworths beats
prospectus target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO months after its ADollars 2.45bn flotation on the Australian stock
market, Woolworths, the Australian retailer, has posted better-than-forecast
profits of ADollars 171.2m (USDollars 114.1m) after tax for the year to June
27.
The net profits figure comfortably beats the ADollars 166.3m which the
retailer predicted in its share sale prospectus.
Yesterday, Mr Paul Simons, chairman, also indicated that the group was 'on
target' to meet its 1994 sales and profits forecasts: in the same
prospectus, Woolworths estimated that it would see sales of about ADollars
11.3bn in the 1993-94 financial year, and after-tax profits of ADollars
188.5m.
Woolworths' profits were scored on sales up by 14.22 per cent to ADollars
10.5bn, with operating profit rising by a similar percentage to ADollars
282.2m. Net profits in the previous year had stood at ADollars 83.8m.
Earnings per share were 17.10 cents compared with 8.38 cents previously.
The retailer plans to open around 14 new supermarkets in the current year,
and plans a capital expenditure budget of approximately ADollars 200m.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: BHP mines a different seam with
Fosters - Broken Hill found a new direction in a hostile bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROKEN HILL Proprietary, a unique blend of businesses that add up to
Australia's biggest company, boasts it is doing better than most of the
world's 'pure' oil, mining or steel groups. But can it repeat the trick with
beer?
There is no reason why not, says Mr John Prescott, chairman and chief
executive. BHP has been tightening its grip on Fosters, the world's
fourth-largest brewing group, after paying ADollars 1.6bn (USDollars 1.06bn)
last year for 37 per cent stake and putting four people on the board.
BHP's connection with Fosters arose from the complex defence BHP mounted in
1988 when the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian corporate
raider, made a determined run at BHP. Eventually freed from Mr Holmes a
Court's clutches, BHP was left with an indirect holding in Fosters. BHP then
took a direct stake in the brewer to protect its investment.
Mr Prescott says this has stabilised Fosters' balance sheet and its board.
Fosters has been encouraged to sell non-core assets.
'Clearly our aim is to build up the value of the Fosters investment to its
book value.
'But why stop there? If we have been successful with building Fosters'
fortunes from where they were last year to a stage where we have put the
value of the investment above its book value, why should we quit?'
Mr Prescott says Fosters has been very good at marketing its products. But
BHP can help it develop other management skills, divisionalise and devolve
management responsibility like BHP, and achieve international ambitions.
How does BHP, one of the world's top five mining companies measured by
profitability, one of the top ten oil companies and one of the very few
profitable steel producers, rationalise this move towards becoming a
conglomerate?
Mr Prescott explains: 'We don't intend to become a conglomerate but we do
intend to take a broad view of our skills base and where that skills base
might lead us.'
BHP has been upgrading the planning function in all its divisions and
looking ahead to the year 2,010. Mr Prescott says that by then the group
will not simply be a larger version of BHP.
'We need to do more than grow our existing businesses; we need to get our
profitability on to a higher plane.'
This talk about profit and returns is quite unlike the BHP of old. Some
analysts suggest it needed someone like Mr Holmes a Court to ginger up BHP,
which owned some of the richest chunks of Australia and seemed able to turn
a profit in its sleep.
But in the mid-1980s, before Mr Holmes a Court appeared on the scene, BHP
had already begun to 'go international'. The process started with the 1984
acquisition of Utah Minerals International, bringing with it North American
coal and copper interests. Then BHP began mining copper and gold at Ok Tedi
in Papua New Guinea, and at the begining of the 1990s brought Escondida, one
of the world's best copper mines, into production in Chile.
All this brought a big change in outlook. BHP today is prepared to go to the
best oil fields and mines in the world rather than wait for them to be found
in Australia. Mr Prescott points out that, while two thirds of the group's
business originates in Australia, only 20 per cent is paid for in Australian
dollars.
'BHP is not a proxy for investment in Australia,' he says.
Last year BHP's pre-tax profit totalled ADollars 1.89bn. The minerals
(mining) division made a ADollars 738.2m profit (up from ADollars 653.8m);
the petroleum division made ADollars 509.5m (ADollars 381m) and the steel
division ADollars 323.2m (ADollars 189.5m.)
Spending, boosted by the purchase of Fosters' shares, reached ADollars 4bn.
BHP has ADollars 5bn of approved projects to take it into the next century
and another ADollars 3bn in the advanced planning stage.
Everything BHP does has to be low-cost, 'at the bottom of the cost curve'.
Any asset that is non-performing, in terms of return on capital and cash
generation and growth potential, will be considered a non-core asset.
'We have quit some things that people thought were fundamental to us because
they failed to meet these criteria,' he says.
BHP assumes that there will be very limited economic growth in the OECD
countries, that economic cycles will continue and that the demand for the
minerals it currently produces will grow more slowly than world economic
growth. 'When you have billions of tonnes of iron ore and coal in reserves
and hundreds of millions of tonnes of copper, you ask yourself wouldn't it
be more profitable creating a market for all that rather than exploring for
more?'
He says BHP must 'find new platforms for growth. We must find new things to
do. We might have to move outside the types of opportunities we have
hitherto engaged in to reach the growth we look for.'
In 1984 BHP doubled in size with the acquisition of Utah. Could it do the
same again, particularly as many assets are going cheap at this phase of the
recession? Mr Prescott says BHP could tackle an acquisition of any size.
'The balance sheet is strong enough to tackle anything we might
contemplate.'

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Forestry interests help North
Broken Hill Peko to 57% gain

<TEXT>
HIGHER profits from its forestry interests, lower interest charges, and
asset sales helped North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group,
to a 57 per cent increase in profits after tax for the year to end-June.
The Melbourne-based company reported a surplus of ADollars 132.4m (USDollars
88.2m) after tax, against ADollars 84.2m in the previous year. Total sales
slipped to ADollars 1.51bn, from ADollars 1.54bn. Earnings per share rose to
21 cents from 13.8 cents.
At the trading level, the company said profits rose to ADollars 265.1m from
ADollars 265.1m . This reflected higher results from forestry and paper - up
to ADollars 43.5m from ADollars 24.7m - and from the Warman International
business, which contributed ADollars 30.5m against ADollars 20.8m. But the
mining and exploration side saw operating profits dip to ADollars 125.7m
from ADollars 140.9m .
North Broken Hill said the tumble on the mining side reflected price and
volume falls at the Robe River Iron Ore project in which it holds a 53 per
cent interest. By contrast, the forestry business gained from reduced costs
and expansion into exports of softwood chips and pine logs.
Interest charges fell to ADollars 44.6m from ADollars 66.9m. North's figures
included abnormal charges of ADollars 18m, reflecting restructuring in the
forestry division, but these were more than offset by abnormal gains, of
ADollars 25m, largely due to asset sales.
Mr Campbell Anderson, chief executive of Australia's Renison Goldfields
Consolidated, is to resign and join North Broken Hill Peko as chief
executive and managing director, AP-DJ reports.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Schweitzer faces a bumpy ride on
difficult journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Louis Schweitzer, who will be in charge of the merged industrial
operations of Renault and Volvo, has enjoyed a smooth rise through the elite
of the French public administration to the top of French industry.
But he now faces his most difficult task, as he oversees the sensitive task
of merging two independent and politically sensitive companies and steers a
course towards privatisation.
The merger with Volvo was not Mr Schweitzer's idea. He inherited the
alliance, which began in 1990, from Mr Raymond Levy, who stepped down in May
1992. But since taking the reins Mr Schweitzer has energetically pursued the
consummation of relations between the two groups.
'Co-operation between Renault and Volvo has been perfect,' he said, 'but we
have to be highly sensitive to competition, so speed is necessary for
success.'
The same might be said about his personal career. A student of the Ecole
Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for the elite of the French
government service, he worked his way quickly up the economic
administration, culminating in 1986 with his appointment as adviser to Mr
Laurent Fabius, the former socialist prime minister.
From there, he joined Renault, where he was named head of the planning
department in 1987. In 1990, at the age of 48, he was appointed managing
director of the car group, making him heir to the Renault throne.
The final jump to the top appeared threatened for a while by resistance from
Mrs Edith Cresson, then socialist prime minister, who opposed the link with
Volvo because of its weak financial position. But support from Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the head of Volvo, helped secure Mr Schweitzer's appointment
as chairman of the French car group.
The two chairmen say there is a close rapport between them. 'He has an
excellent analytical mind,' said Mr Gyllenhammar of his counterpart
yesterday. 'I know we are going to work well together.' Mr Schweitzer, for
his part, praised the visionary capacity of his counterpart.
Such warm ties are going to be essential in the delicate task of combining
their operations.
Apart from avoiding strains with Renault's new partner, Mr Schweitzer's most
difficult task will be to steer the new group through the depressed European
car market. His record so far includes encouraging signs.
The recovery in Renault's fortunes has coincided with Mr Schweitzer's stint
at the company. Since he joined in 1986, Renault has reversed a period of
heavy losses which saw six consecutive years of deficits until 1987 and net
losses as high as FFr12.6bn in 1984. Last year, by contrast, profits reached
FFr5.5bn (Dollars 940m).
Much of this progress was due to Mr Levy's legacy. But French industry
officials say that Mr Schweitzer also played an important role in improving
quality and efficiency and in introducing innovative new products such as
the Twingo small car which was launched last year and has sold strongly.
Since he took over as chairman, however, times have become harder.
First-half profits, announced last month, fell by almost 90 per cent
compared with the same period in 1992.
Resisting the downturn, and forging the two parts of the new group into a
greater whole, will be the test of Mr Schweitzer's success.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: A marriage to respect
sensitivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger agreement between Renault and Volvo bears the hallmarks of a
carefully-arranged marriage.
The problem the two groups faced in achieving their merger was to overcome
the sensitivities involved in uniting two powerful industrial groups while
respecting their relative balance of power.
The solution is a complex division of financial and management structures
which give the French government, Renault's principal shareholder, the
stronger hand.
At the core of the agreement is the creation of two separate bodies, a
holding company, called RVC, and Renault-Volvo Automotive, the linchpin of
the organisation, which pools all the automotive interests and financial
subsidiaries of both groups. Volvo's non-automotive businesses, such as its
marine engines and food interests, will not be part of this company.
Renault-Volvo Automotive will conduct the business operations of the new
group. It will be responsible for all strategic and management decisions.
RVC will have no management role. Its task, say the companies, is to
safeguard the interests of shareholders.
In both of the new bodies, the French will be the dominant partner. The
French state will hold 51 per cent of RVC through Renault SA, which is owned
100 per cent by the French government. The French state will also hold
directly 46.3 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. AB Volvo will hold 49
per cent of RVC and 17.85 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive.
Renault and Volvo described the agreement as balanced. 'It is a fact that
Renault is twice as big as Volvo and so naturally that is reflected in the
equity structure,' the companies said in a statement yesterday.
If French interests are dominant in the financial structure they are also
stronger at the management level. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the current chairman
of Renault, will become chairman of Renault-Volvo Automotive's management
board and be in charge of the day-to-day running of the group.
RVC will be governed by a six-member board - three appointed by Renault and
three by Volvo. The chairman of the board, who holds the casting vote, will,
however, be nominated by Renault SA. Both RVC and Renault-Volvo Automotive
will be based in France.
But if Volvo is the junior partner, it remains a powerful one, due to a
system of checks and balances within the merger agreement. The most
important includes the establishment of a supervisory board.
Such a body, common in German industry, is highly unusual in France. It will
appoint Renault-Volvo Automotive's management board and will decide on what
the companies describe as 'major financial issues'.
The chairman of the supervisory board will be proposed by Volvo. Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, the current Volvo chairman, is expected to take this post.
Beneath him will be an 18-member board, reduced to 14 after the sale of the
French government's share in Renault-Volvo Automotive which is expected by
1995.
The 18 members will comprise six representatives from the French state,
three representatives from AB Volvo, three members from the international
business community chosen for their expertise, and six employee
representatives from the Renault-Volvo Automotive group.
Volvo's hand is also strengthened by the terms of the shareholders'
agreement which will be valid for 25 years following the initiation of the
merger on January 1 1994. Both Renault and Volvo will be able to terminate
the shareholders' agreement at the end of the eighth year of the merger,
subject to two years' prior notice.
According to a statement from the joint group, the shareholders' agree-ment
will establish the balance of power between Renault and Volvo in what are
described as 'vital matters'.
On other subjects, sub-mitted to shareholders, the statement says, a simple
majority will be sufficient.
In practice, this appears to give Volvo a veto power over important issues
such as the raising of capital and investments in new products and
facilities.
'It is an important means of limiting Renault's power,' said one Paris-based
automobile industry analyst. 'It gives some reassurance to Volvo's
shareholders.'
Such reassurance, which runs through the terms of the agreement, will
determine whether the merger runs smoothly.
Both Renault and Volvo will hope it prevents outbursts of marital strife.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Gyllenhammar set to play the role
of a champion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo for 22 years, yesterday's merger
with Renault was something of a paradox.
On one side, the deal is the consummation of an alliance that reflects Mr
Gyllenhammar's long-cultivated role of industrial statesman and vociferous
advocate of Sweden's need to move closer to the rest of Europe. Already
decorated with the Legion d'Honneur and a fluent French speaker, he will
revel in his position as the figurehead of a European automotive giant.
But there is also the less glorious side: for the merger amounts to an
admission by a man committed to preserving Sweden's industrial strength that
Volvo, the country's best known manufacturing company, can no longer compete
on its own. Words he penned in 1986, when Volvo was in its heyday, now look
painfully outdated.
'My hope is that Volvo will remain a strong enterprise - that it will never
have to seek help from outside. It is the most important thing,' he wrote in
a book about the company.
PG, as he is universally known in Sweden, will doubtless shrug off such
awkward echoes from the past. Since he took over from his father-in-law, Mr
Gunnar Engellau, as Volvo managing director in 1971 at the age of 36, he has
rarely been out of the public eye in Sweden, evoking both admiration and
irritation among his reticent compatriots for his outspoken and ambitious
stewardship of the group.
A former chief of the insurance company Skandia, Mr Gyllenhammar has
presided over two decades of growth at Volvo in which its cars have achieved
an international reputation for safety and utility - and lately even
performance. But his restless search for new horizons has over the years
also led Volvo in strange directions.
In the late 1970s, successive attempts to merge with Saab-Scania, Volvo's
great domestic rival owned by the Wallenberg family, to sell a 40 per cent
shareholding in the group to the Norwegian government in return for North
Sea oil rights and to persuade the Swedish government to invest SKr1bn in
the company flared and then died.
A decade later, Volvo was riding high as one of the world's most profitable
carmakers. Mr Gyllenhammar, who in 1990 moved from the position of chief
executive to the role of executive chairman, won plaudits for his pioneering
of new 'humane' production techniques that sought to replace the traditional
assembly line with team-based assembly systems.
Recession in the 1990s, however, exposed how far Volvo had slipped in
international competitiveness and the new plants were closed, with thousands
of Swedish workers laid off as losses mounted.
Mr Gyllenhammar's advocacy of international partnerships as the way forward
for Swedish companies was vindicated, but in Volvo's case with more of a
defensive character than he surely originally intended.
Now, the automotive heart of Volvo will take its place as a junior partner
in the new company, with 'PG' no doubt playing a high-profile role as a
champion of the Swedish contribution to the alliance.
But many in Sweden believe the deal will also presage the effective
departure from the Swedish industrial scene of one of its most remarkable
sons. 'This will be his crowning glory - and then he will abdicate,'
predicted one businessman who knows him well.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Sweden offers the deal a cautious
welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPRESSEN, one of Sweden's robust tabloid newspapers, was furious yesterday
over what it described as the sell-out to France of the country's biggest
manufacturer. 'Gyllenhammar's treachery against Sweden,' blared its headline
in reference to the Volvo chairman.
But if the newspaper expressed a populist view, it was not one shared by the
political and industrial establishment. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister,
welcomed the merger of Volvo's automotive operations with Renault as
securing a future for motor manufacturing in Sweden; so, too, did the
opposition Social Democratic Party. Even a senior trade unionist in Volvo
said its competitiveness would be strengthened by the deal.
'Regrettable but inevitable,' a comment from a Stockholm investment banker,
summed up the reaction of most professional Swedes to the long-awaited
completion of the merger. The low-key response underlined how much attitudes
have changed since 1990 when Mr Gyllenhammar said any move under foreign
ownership by Volvo would cause Sweden 'to suffer an identity crisis'.
A jolting, three-year recession is what has made the difference. In the late
1980s, when Volvo and other top Swedish companies were enjoying a boom, talk
of industry becoming more international was framed mainly in the context of
Swedish acquisitions abroad.
The merger in 1988 between Asea, the Swedish engineering group, and Brown
Boveri of Switzerland, to create the giant, Swiss-based ABB gave some pause.
But with Mr Percy Barnevik of Asea in charge, it was seen in Sweden as a
deal between equals.
Today, with unemployment at 13 per cent and rising, there is widespread
recognition that Sweden had become dangerously uncompetitive - a trend only
partly offset by the 25 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona this year.
The acceptance of Volvo becoming a junior partner to Renault was not hard to
achieve.
'Ten years ago there would have been turmoil from the unions,' said a senior
government official. 'But not these days.'
Instead, analysts in Stockholm regarded the ownership split, which leaves
the Swedish side with 35 per cent of the new Renault-Volvo Automotive
company, as a good deal for Volvo.
Volvo could probably have soldiered on for some time, having returned to
profit in the first half of this year. It may be due to big improvements in
productivity.
But a significant part of the reason it is making money again is that it has
new car and truck models in place and is not currently incurring the huge
development costs new models require. Volvo knew it almost certainly could
not have borne on its own the next round of product development.
It is not alone in Sweden in this. Within the stable of the Wallenberg
family, the country's premier industrial owners, raising sufficient
investment capital is a pre-eminent concern. Half of Saab, Volvo's great
local rival carmaker, was sold to General Motors by the Wallenbergs to help
spread the cost of new car development.
The residual question about Volvo yesterday was over the future shape of the
parent group. The aircraft and marine motor divisions were not part of the
merger with Renault. Nor were Volvo's other holdings, principally in
Procordia, a part state-owned pharmaceuticals and food group.
Under a deal with the Swedish government this year, Volvo will have by next
year up to a 35 per cent stake in Pharmacia, Procordia's pharmaceutical
unit, and 100 per cent of its Branded Consumer Products arm, which includes
beer and food products.
Mr Gyllenhammar's evident intention is that the new Volvo umbrella group
will become a holding company with stakes in the motor industry through
Renault-Volvo Automotive, pharmaceuticals, food and other engineering
interests - ironically not unlike Investor, the main Wallenberg vehicle.
It is a far cry from the 1920s when Volvo was founded to make cars by Gustaf
Larson and Assar Gabrielsson, two executives from SKF, the Swedish bearing
company.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Last stop in plan for
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the French government, the merger between Renault and Volvo is the last
stop on the road to privatising one of the most important symbols of
state-owned industry.
In May, Renault was placed on the list of the 21 state-owned companies
targeted for sale as part of the government's ambitious privatisation
programme which gets under way this autumn with the sale of Banque Nationale
de Paris.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday that he
hoped Renault's privatisation could take place from the second half of 1994,
depending on market conditions and the performance of the merger.
The government's desire to see Renault in the private sector reflects both
pragmatic and strategic considerations. The strength of the company and its
familiarity with French and international investors makes it a relatively
attractive candidate for privatisation.
Industry analysts estimate that a sale of the government's entire stake
could raise about FFr40bn (Dollars 6.87bn), a substantial asset in the
government's plans to curb its budget deficit, targeted at FFr317bn this
year and FFr300bn next year.
Plans to privatise Renault also reflect a conviction in Mr Balladur's
government that the competitiveness of French industry requires reduced
state intervention and a greater role for market forces.
Privatisation will, however, be a delicate task. In particular, the
government is determined to maintain French control of the merged car group
after the sale of its shares.
French control is important for political reasons. 'Renault's history means
the merger and privatisation are a very sensitive political issue,' says a
government official. 'It will require careful handling.'
Such careful handling is evident throughout the terms of yesterday's deal
which includes a series of measures to maintain French control after
privatisation and to protect the company from predators. At the core of this
structure is the creation of two companies - a holding company (RVC), and a
company which pools the automotive interests of Renault and Volvo
(Renault-Volvo Automotive). The holding company has 35 per cent of
Renault-Volvo Automotive.
Initially, the French government will hold 51 per cent of RVC and 46.4 per
cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive, giving it effective control of the group
at both levels. But with privatisation, which is expected to involve the
sale of the state's direct 46.4 per cent stake in Renault-Volvo Automotive,
the dominance of French investors is obviously threatened.
Once privatised, the whole shareholding structure changes, but French
control may not. Under the agreement with Volvo, the French state reserves
to right to retain a 'golden share' in Renault-Volvo Automotive when the
group is privatised. This device will require French approval for any
increase or participation in the share capital of Renault-Volvo Automotive,
up to a certain, unspecified, level.
In addition, the government will seek to assemble a core of long-term stable
French investors in Renault SA, the majority shareholder in RVC which holds
35 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. The government itself could be one
of these shareholders.
The rest of this core is likely to comprise state-owned banks and insurance
companies. But it could also involve industrial companies.
One such group is Matra-Hachette, the French defence electronics and media
company. Its cars division co-produces the Espace luxury van with Renault.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Locked-up value keeps investors
keen - The long-term prospects for Mannesmann's telecoms business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half-year results at Mannesmann, one of the largest industrial companies in
Germany, were dire even by the standards of the country's struggling
engineering sector. The shares, however, have continued to display a
remarkable degree of relative stock market strength.
The group made a six-month loss of DM467m (Dollars 291.9m) on unchanged
sales of DM12.8bn. This compared with a net profit of DM15m in the first
half of last year, and was worse than analysts' gloomy expectations.
Since the figures were announced - on August 19 - Mannesmann's shares have
dropped from DM333.20 to DM325 last week, a decline of 2.4 per cent. This
compares with a 1 per cent fall in the DAX index of 30 leading German shares
over the period.
In fact, Mannesmann shares remain close to the year's high of DM340, which
shows the company remains a favourite with investors, especially US
institutional investors whose buying has driven the strong rise in the
German equity market in recent months.
The shares are 36 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of the
year. Since the start of June, they have outperformed the DAX by around 16
per cent.
The attractions of Mannesmann for investors are not obvious: like other
German engineering groups, it has been hit hard by the worldwide fall in
demand for capital goods, recession in Germany, the impact of a strong
D-Mark on its exports, and by the costs of implementing rationalisation
measures.
As a result, not a single one of its six operating divisions - spanning a
range of engineering activities from steel pipe manufacturing to plant
construction and automotive components - made a profit in the first half.
And the group suggested there was little room for improvement in its core
businesses during the second half of the year.
In part, what is true for Mannesmann holds true for the German market as a
whole: investors are willing to ignore the bleak earnings outlook for the
current year and look ahead to next year and beyond for economic recovery
and a revival in profitability. Engineering companies, the so-called
'cyclical stocks' - in theory poised to make the most of recovery in 1994-95
 -have been at the centre of investors' buying interests.
In the case of Mannesmann, investors' optimism is pinned less on generalised
expectations of recovery, than on specific hopes for the D2 mobile
telecommunications network operated by Mannesmann's Mobilfunk subsidiary.
Mannesmann has been developing this business since 1989, when it won one of
two digital cellular radio licences awarded in Germany.
The move into mobile telecommunications was part of a strategy of reducing
the group's dependence on the capital goods sector, and on its traditional
pipes activities.
It went hand in hand with a series of acquisitions in the automotive
components sector: since 1987-88 the group has spent an estimated DM4bn
buying companies such as Fichtel &amp; Sachs and Boge - which both specialise in
suspension systems - and VDO, which makes instrumentation panels. Turnover
in this area was DM6.5bn.
The strategic sense of making a commitment to the components sector just
ahead of a significant downturn in the European car industry is open to
doubt. Like all other parts of the group's business, automotive technology
is lossmaking.
By contrast, the move into mobile telecommunications is seen as a
masterstroke on the part of chief executive Mr Werner Dieter.
Up until now, Mobilfunk has been a heavy drain on the group's resources.
According to Alan Coats, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, D2
is likely to cost Mannesmann and its minority partners on the project DM3bn
before it breaks even at the operational level next year.
The future prospects, however, are deemed to be exceedingly bright.
Mannesmann is estimated to have around 60 per cent of the German market for
wireless communications. This market has enormous growth prospects, as the
so-called 'cellular penetration rate' - the number of subscribers as a
percentage of the population - is far behind US and UK levels.
In 1992, that rate was 1.1 per cent in Germany compared with 4 per cent in
the US, 2.5 per cent in the UK, and 8 per cent in Sweden.
After technical problems led to a year's delay in introducing the D2
network, the number of Mannesmann's subscribers went from zero to 117,000
last year. Last week, the group said there were more than 200,000
subscribers at the half-way stage, better than expectations.
Mannesmann's exposure to the sector is likely to mean a strong and growing
contribution to profits from late 1994 onwards.
As if to underscore the value inherent in Mannesmann's D2 business, AT &amp; T's
Dollars 12.4bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications was announced
just days before Mannesmann unveiled its disastrous interim figures.
Like Mannesmann Mobilfunk, McCaw is a lossmaking company with enormous
potential - potential which convinced AT &amp; T to make one of the largest
takeovers in US corporate history.
The big US company has concentrated investors' minds on the potential value
locked up in Mannesmann Mobilfunk.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Asset sale helps lift Carrefour
to FFr1.6bn

CARREFOUR, the leading player in French food retailing, yesterday announced
a steep increase in interim net profits, to FFr1.66bn (Dollars 291m) this
year from FFr277m in the first half of 1992. A capital gain of FFr1.36bn on
the sale of its stake in the Castorama furniture chain helped the result.
Despite the sluggish state of the retail sector, Carrefour managed to
increase pre-tax profits before exceptional items from FFr281m to FFr565m.
Its poor performance last autumn, when Carrefour disclosed a sharp fall in
interim profits, triggered the resignation of Mr Michel Bon as chairman.
Mr Daniel Bernard, the new chairman, said Carrefour was on course for
further profits growth in the second half. He predicted that consumer
spending in France would remain static, but said he hoped to boost profits
through improvements in productivity.
He forecast an increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items of 20
per cent for 1993. He also anticipated sales growth of 5 per cent.
Carrefour, like other French retailers, has been affected by the economic
recession and by increased competition from German discounters, notably
Aldi. However, it increased turnover from FFr55.2bn in the first six months
of 1992 to FFr57.64bn in the interim period this year.
The group in March made a FFr1.36bn profit on the FFr1.8bn placing of its
28.8 per cent stake in Castorama, one of France's largest DIY chains. The
proceeds have been used to reduce debt.
The windfall from the Castorama deal was tempered by a provision for the
closure of two hypermarkets in Philadelphia. Mr Bernard said Carrefour was
still committed to maintaining a strong presence in the US. It is the
largest shareholder in Costco Wholesale, now in the process of merging with
Price Co to form a Dollars 16bn group with 200 stores.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Alusuisse warns of payout cut as
profit slides 42%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALUSUISSE yesterday reported an unexpected 42 per cent slide in first-half
net income, to SFr49m (Dollars 35m). It warned of a 20 to 30 per cent fall
in earnings for the full year, and a possible dividend cut.
The bad news sent shares of the Swiss aluminium, fine chemicals and
packaging group tumbling. The bearer shares ended SFr20 lower at SFr510 on
the Zurich borse.
Alusuisse, which has been struggling for three years to reduce its
dependence on the volatile aluminium business, was again badly hurt by the
disarray in this sector.
Group sales in the first half were down 6 per cent, to SFr3.15bn, and
aluminium revenues slumped 12 per cent to SFr1.37bn.
Operating profit was off 24 per cent, to SFr152m, as profits from continuing
aluminium businesses slumped 47 per cent to SFr46m. Four aluminium
subsidiaries in Germany, which are being run down or sold, recorded
operating losses of SFr42m.
Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, pointed out that in 1989 the four
German subsidiaries yielded operating profits of DM100m, whereas this year
they would lose DM100m in spite of aggressive cost-cutting.
Such a swing was not due to the cyclical nature of the business nor to the
recession, but to the ongoing structural crisis in the aluminium sector.
This was blamed on unfair competition from government-subsidised smelters
and low cost imports from eastern Europe.
Mr Tschopp foresaw no return to 'the old intact, ideal world' in aluminium.
The group, then, would continue to eliminate operations that had no future,
and would concentrate on building its chemicals and packaging businesses.
Its chemical division managed to raise operating profits by 17 per cent, to
SFr88m, in the first half, in spite of flat sales of SFr791m. The
performance of high value-added fine chemicals for life science applications
made up for sluggish sales and prices in primary materials for plastics.
The 12 per cent rise in packaging division sales, to SFr736m, was attributed
to the transfer of activities from the aluminium division. Operating profit
was flat at SFr63m.
Mr Tschopp said there was no sign of recovery in most of the group's
markets. As the second half tended to be seasonally weaker than the first,
he forecast that consolidated net income for the year would slide to between
SFr80m and SFr100m, compared with last year's SFr121m.
Mr Hans Jucker, chairman, indicated that once again the dividend was not
secure. 'It is our goal to leave the dividend unchanged if possible.
However, that depends on the progress of our restructuring measures, on the
general economic situation, and on the start of the new year 1994,' he said.

FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: French sweets go to US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PIECE of French gastronomic tradition yesterday passed into American hands
when Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceutical group, acquired Cachou Lajaunie,
maker of the famous cachou sweets the French nibble to freshen their breath
after garlicky meals.
The vendor is Pierre Fabre, the cosmetics group which acquired Cachou
Lajaunie in 1989 and subsequently pushed the company through a period of
rapid expansion. Cachou Lajaunie expects to sell 12m boxes of sweets this
year.
Pierre Fabre, best known for its Klorane and Aveze cosmetics brands, has
pursued aggressive product development for Cachou Lajaunie, notably by
introducing a successful line of mint-flavoured cachous. Cachou Lajaunie's
turnover has doubled from FFr17m in 1989 to an estimated FFr35m (Dollars
6.1m) this year.
One of the largest remaining family-controlled companies in the French
pharmaceuticals industry, Pierre Fabre expects turnover this year to total
FFr5bn.
Its disposal of Cachou Lajaunie is part of plans to concentrate on
mainstream cosmetics and pharmaceutical interests. Pierre Fabre is also keen
to raise capital to augment research activities.
Warner-Lambert has bought Cachou Lajaunie for an undisclosed sum through
Parke-Davis, its confectionery subsidiary. Parke-Davis employs 1,000 people.
The US group already has significant confectionery interests in France. It
acquired Vichy, the French brand of pastilles, in 1989, and bought Clorets
chewing gum in 1991.
The takeover of Cahou Lajaunie cements an already close relationship between
the two companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Delhaize 'Le Lion', the Belgian retail group, fell more than
70 per cent, to BFr1.01bn (Dollars 28.5m) in the first half of 1993, from
BFr3.43bn in the same period a year ago.
Delhaize also warned its full-year profits would be lower than in 1992, and
said it may hold its 1993 dividend at last year's BFr20 per share. Group
sales rose 8.2 per cent to BFr163bn, against BFr151bn.
The Belgian stores pushed up sales from BFr45.15bn to BFr45.29bn. However,
recession, falling food prices, and industrial disputes cut profits.
Turnover at the Food Lion chain in the US rose to Dollars 3.41bn from
3.24bn. The supermarkets, however, suffered a 48 per cent drop in net
profits in the first half, to Dollars 52.6m, as they tried to recover from a
wave of bad publicity.
Last month, Food Lion settled a long-running dispute over federal labour
laws with the US department of labour. The company granted back pay of
Dollars 13.2m to some employees who had worked overtime without pay. It was
fined Dollars 2m for that dispute and Dollars 1m for failing to ensure
adequate safety conditions for employees under 18.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Wills advance to Pounds
1.56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLS GROUP, the expanding distributor of high specification fluid handling
equipment, achieved a profits rise from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds 1.56m
pre-tax for the year ended July 3.
The figures included a two months' contribution from Platon International,
the former USM-quoted instrumentation company acquired for Pounds 2.7m.
Along with the purchase, which followed the acquisition of Lightfoot
Refrigeration in December, a 1-for-3 rights issue was launched to raise
Pounds 5.2m.
The money raised will help restructure Platon's finances and develop new
products.
Group turnover for the year expanded from Pounds 15m to Pounds 19.28m,
including Pounds 1.33m from acquisitions. Interest charges were cut to
Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 133,000).
Earnings per share improved from 0.72p to 1.6p basic, or from 0.6p to 1.28p
diluted. A final dividend of 0.3p makes a 0.4p (0.1p) total.
The directors hoped the first six months would see further progress in
profitability as sales and profits are weighted towards the second half.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ASW bounces back into the black midway with
Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASW HOLDINGS, the steel products group based in Wales, bounced back into the
black in the first half of 1993 and announced a Pounds 10m scheme to reduce
costs substantially at one of its Cardiff rolling mills.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.1m for
the corresponding period and a deficit of Pounds 8.7m - including Pounds
4.6m of restructuring costs - for the second half of 1992.
Turnover in the opening half was Pounds 230.5m (Pounds 190.5m). Earnings per
share were 0.0p (losses 4.2p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p.
Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said the company felt 'more confident than in
a long time' about its main steel businesses. These activities made a
first-half operating profit of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 900,000), almost all of
which came in the second quarter as the benefits of price increases and
higher margins came through.
Mr Cox said the steel businesses' operating profit was running at an annual
rate of Pounds 23m in the second quarter. This compares with a peak of
Pounds 41.5m achieved in 1990 before the collapse in UK and European steel
prices.
He was cautious about the outlook for margins in the steel business.
Currently they were not as high as in the second quarter, and predictions
for 1994 would depend on the trend in the last three months.
In some parts of Europe, he said, margins were still lower than in 1992.
The Pounds 10m investment at Cardiff will change the cost structure for
production of merchant bars - angles and other sections used in engineering.
In line with ASW's policy, the investment would have a two-year pay back.
ASW's much smaller construction systems business incurred a loss of Pounds
2.5m, compared to a Pounds 1.9m deficit a year earlier. But Mr Cox said a
much reduced deficit was expected in the second half and expressed optimism
about the division's new products.
The group has not produced a balance sheet at the half year stage, but said
the increased volumes and higher prices in its steel business led to higher
levels of working capital. Borrowing facilities were enough to accommodate
this increase and projected capital spending.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Haynes' shares rise 37p on record Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERPINNED by improving performances in the US, Haynes Publishing Group,
the car and motor cycle maintenance manual company, reported record pre-tax
profits for the year to May 31. The shares rose 37p to 455p.
Mr John Haynes, chairman, said the rise was the result of improved
management of the business rather than an increase in sales.
On turnover 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 22.8m, against Pounds 21.2m, pre-tax
profits advanced 67 per cent from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 3.95m. Earnings per
share rose from 14.53p to 26.5p. Directors are proposing a final dividend of
4.5p for a total of 8p (6p).
An enhanced scrip dividend of 6.5p is being offered. Mr Max Pearce, chief
executive, said the move was to conserve cash and also to pre-empt possible
future ACT problems because of the level of profits from the US.
In the US pre-tax profits were a record Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.8m) on sales
of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.74m). The company said that the Haynes manual in
the US had established a leading market position.
During the year sufficient cash was generated in the group to repay net
borrowings of Pounds 1.3m and end the period with Pounds 1.6m on deposit
after investing Pounds 1.5m in capital assets. The net interest charge fell
to Pounds 69,000 (Pounds 382,000).
Market development in France was proceeding to plan but was unlikely to
contribute significantly for the the next two or three years. Mr Pearce said
that there were plans for expanding in other parts of the continent,
particularly eastern Europe.
In the UK pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.3m, up Pounds 1m, most of which
was the result of lower exceptionals and interest charges. Losses in general
publishing were halved.
Mr Pearce said that the UK was the only area for caution. Despite its
dominant market position, more work was needed before profits returned to an
acceptable level.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Costs of acquiring Roulement Service leave
Brammer unchanged at Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMMER, the industrial services group, reported flat pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.2m in spite of increasing sales by 27 per cent to Pounds 71.2m,
against Pounds 56.1m, for the six months to June 30.
A strong performance by BSL, the distributor of ballbearings and power
transmission products, helped increase group operating profits by 27 per
cent to Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 3.91m.
However, the pre-tax figure was affected by the impact of last year's
acquisition of Roulement Service, a French distributor of bearings. Net
interest costs of Pounds 732,000 compared with interest receivable of Pounds
317,000 last time.
Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive, said BSL had an excellent half
year, with sales 4.1 per cent ahead of the same period last year and 9.2 per
cent higher than the second half of 1992. Market share and sales per
employee were both significantly higher.
Roulement had made good progress, increasing market share, but was unable to
buck the recession in France. The company managed to make a small operating
profit, although sales were 4.3 per cent lower than in the first half year
and gross margins were under constant pressure.
Mr Ffoulkes-Jones said Roulement had been recently appointed the first
nationwide distributor in France for the products of SKF, the Swedish
roller-bearer manufacturer which dominated the French market. Brammer
planned to make more acquisitions in Europe.
The rentals group, which specialises in electronic testing equipment,
increased sales by 19 per cent. Livingston Hire of the UK increased profits
substantially in generally better market conditions, but smaller companies
in France, Germany and the Netherlands all had a difficult six months.
Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, said: 'Trading in the UK is currently at the
improved levels experienced during the first half of the year but recovery
remains fragile.
'In the rest of Europe the recession continues and we need to see an
improvement in business confidence, particularly in France which now
represents more than 20 per cent of group turnover.'
Earnings per share fell to 6.6p, against 6.9p previously, but the interim
dividend is being held at 4.5p.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lucas agrees to buy Dowty Fuel off TI Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries yesterday moved to strengthen its position as Europe's
leading manufacturer of aircraft fuel systems with the Pounds 18.9m agreed
purchase of Dowty Fuel Systems from TI Group.
Dowty Fuel Systems, based in Cheltenham, makes engine controls and
accessories, employs 390 people and has net assets of about Pounds 11.9m.
But while the deal is relatively modest financially for both Lucas and TI,
it is strategically significant.
Lucas said last October that it wanted to strengthen its core businesses, of
which engine control systems is one, and dispose of its non-core assets.
Several sales have followed, but yesterday's announcement represents the
first acquisition.
Sales by Dowty Fuel Systems totalled more than Pounds 20m last year, and the
company will be merged with Birmingham-based Lucas Engine Control Systems to
create an Pounds 80m business.
No decisions have yet been made on whether to retain the Cheltenham
manufacturing site, but Lucas in any case expects to make big savings
through the integration. This would enable it to boost profits at the Dowty
unit, which made Pounds 1m pre-tax in the last nine months of 1992.
Lucas said the products of the merged businesses were complementary. While
there was some duplication in main engine and afterburner fuel controls, the
Dowty unit would bring Lucas new products such as actuators.
The deal would also give Lucas access to big Dowty customers in North
America such as Garrett Engines and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.
For TI, the sale is part of its restructuring of Dowty Aerospace - following
last year's takeover of Dowty - to focus on its world-leading businesses
such as aircraft landing gear.
The sale is one of TI's largest since the takeover. It is also the first of
a number of non-core businesses which TI is in negotiations to sell - for an
estimated total of about Pounds 100m.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Chairman of Linx resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of Linx Printing Technologies, the maker of continuous ink-jet
printing equipment, has resigned after the company's poor full-year results,
making way for Mr Michael Moore, non-executive chairman of Tomkins, the
conglomerate.
Mr Moore was appointed as a non-executive director of Linx before the
company's flotation last October.
The shares, which floated at 130p, have been around yesterday's closing
price of 94p in recent weeks. They peaked at 220p in March, fell from about
180p to 120p after a profits warning in May and the resignation of Mr John
Shead, the sales and marketing director.
This spring, both Linx and its UK rival Domino Printing Sciences warned of
poor trading because of the recession and the market's maturity. Linx also
admitted to what Mr Harris called 'structural problems on the marketing
side'.
Linx full-year results in July showed pre-tax profits for the year to June

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Fairey 26% to Pounds
10.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIREY, the specialist electronics and engineering group, reported a 26 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits for the half year ended June 26, reflecting a
strong performance in all its main operating divisions.
Profits were Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 8.1m) on the back of a 32 per cent rise in
turnover from Pounds 48.2m to Pounds 63.8m.
Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said the results showed 'the abilities of
the group's businesses - both long established and recently acquired - to
prosper in the uneven world trading environment.'
He described the performance of the core electronics and electrical power
sector as 'gratifying,' reflecting both organic growth and contributions
from acquisitions made in the second half of last year. There was slight
disappointment with sales in France and Germany; but operating profits of
the division rose to Pounds 7.19m (Pounds 5.08m) on turnover up to Pounds
39.2m (Pounds 25.7m).
This month the group completed the acquisition of Luxtron, a Californian
maker of temperature measuring and semi-conductor process control equipment,
for Dollars 12.7m (Pounds 8.4m). Fairey said it had concentrated on
acquiring specialised electronics companies with a niche market rather than
commodity electronics companies.
Operating profits in the aerospace and defence division, which only a few
years ago accounted for nearly half group turnover, rose to Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 778,000) on turnover of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 10.06m).
Mr Poulter said the 1992 figures had been distorted by the consolidation of
the division on one site. Nevertheless, margins in the latest period had
held up well, costs were under control and new business had been attracted.
The Saudi order for Tornadoes would generate useful profits in 1995 and
1996.
Filtration and ceramics was the one sector where companies experienced 'a
somewhat tougher time in the recession', Mr Poulter said. Operating profits
edged ahead to Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.54m) on turnover of Pounds 13.3m
(Pounds 12.4m).
Net cash was Pounds 6.1m at June 26, up almost Pounds 4m since the end of
last year. Net interest receivable fell, however, from Pounds 718,000 to
Pounds 146,000. Earnings per share were 18.3p (15.4p) and the interim
dividend is raised to 3.8p (3.3p).

<TEXT>
John Haggas, worsted spinner, improved its pre-tax profit from Pounds 2.88m
to Pounds 2.93m and earnings per share from 9p to 9.1p in the year ended
June 30.
In the spinning division it was a year of consolidation with margins still
under pressure and activity improving but only slowly.
There was a similar picture in fabrics, but sales to Europe had increased
substantially, albeit at low margins.
The final dividend is 2p to hold the total at 3p.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: TLS Range returns to profits with Pounds
34,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TLS Range, the USM-quoted vehicle rental concern, returned to profits with
Pounds 34,000 for the first six months of 1993 on turnover of Pounds 5.03m.
This compared with losses of Pounds 77,000 last time, from Pounds 4.7m
turnover, which increased to Pounds 190,000 by the 1992 year end.
Tax for the half year of Pounds 34,000 left the company at break-even; nil
earnings were against 0.41p losses. There is again no interim dividend - a
single final 0.25p was paid for 1992 - but the directors were optimistic
that a return to a 'progressive dividend policy' would be achievable in the
short term.
Mr David Yeomans, chairman, stated that operating lease rentals, which
contained an element of interest included in cost of sales, resulted in a
reduction in operating profits from Pounds 466,000 to Pounds 294,000.
However, this also involved a significant fall in finance charges to Pounds
260,000 (Pounds 545,000).
Mr Yeomans pointed out that utilisation levels had increased from 72 per
cent last January to 86 per cent in June, while rises in revenue per unit
'had been evident across the fleet'.
He added that the company's car and civil engineering fleets grew by 24.8
per cent and 28.5 per cent respectively, reflecting growing market
penetration. Gearing, he stated, had been brought down from 168 per cent to
97 per cent.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lilliput Lane to float 3 years after Pounds
1.2m rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLIPUT LANE, the Cumbrian miniature model maker, is to float in November,
only three years after being rescued with Pounds 1.2m of venture capital.
North of England Ventures, which put in Pounds 850,000, is expected to make
an estimated Pounds 7m from selling five-sixths of its 30 per cent stake.
Lazard Ventures, which had previously backed a disastrous diversification by
Lilliput in 1987, was the other institutional equity partner in the 1990
deal.
Mr John Russell, whose appointment as chairman and chief executive was a
condition of the rescue, will continue to run the business.
Lilliput Lane employs 650 people, has 140 current models and exports to 45
countries.
It was founded 11 years ago by Mr David Tate, an artist who worked out how
to mould intricate miniature designs for mass production.
He is the technical director and will be the third principal beneficiary of
the flotation.
Mr Russell, an accountant who learned his managerial skills with Burton and
Courtaulds, introduced productivity controls into the mass hand-painting of
Lilliput's models.
He also developed a worldwide collectors' club. This now has 63,000 members,
nearly 18,000 of them in the US, where models which have been 'retired' from
production sometimes change hands for thousands of dollars.

Whitbread has sold 15 of its Lansbury hotels to Countryside Coaching Inns, a
newly-formed private company.
The sale, for an undisclosed sum, is part of Whitbread's reshuffling of its
hotel portfolio. The food, drinks and leisure group says it intends to sell
a further eight Lansbury hotels, leaving it with 19.
The remaining hotels are 50 to 60 room three-star establishments. The hotels
sold and those still up for sale do not fall into this category.
The group also has its Travel Inn brand of budget hotels, as well as Country
Club hotels, which it markets as conference venues with sporting facilities.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Imry incurs Pounds 24.5m loss after making
provisions of Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMRY Holdings, the property company taken over by Barclays last December
after one of the largest debt write-downs in corporate history, incurred a
loss for the year to March 31 of Pounds 24.5m.
The company made provisions of Pounds 21m against loss on investment and
trading properties and joint venture schemes.
Value of the investment and trading portfolio fell by 8.5 per cent to Pounds
276.6m. Its net assets were Pounds 71m at the year end.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said last year was one of the most demanding ever
experienced by the property industry. However, he added that lower interest
rates, together with a bottoming out of the economy, was encouraging greater
activity in the property market as a whole.
Imry's current debt is about Pounds 200m, of which Pounds 60m is owed to
Barclays. The balance, due to other institutions and banks, is a mixture of
long-term debentures, a facility to finance part of the trading portfolio
and a medium-term loan secured on the The Shires shopping centre in
Leicester.
Mr Davies said that Imry was unlikely to remain part of Barclays in the long
term. He said that a flotation or a reversal into a quoted company was 'a
logical outcome' over the next three to five years.
Imry's property is split between office and retail property, with a small
element of industrial property. Its largest asset is The Shires, which
covers 500,000 sq ft.
After Barclays took control of Imry, it appointed Mr David Casson and Mr
Lawrence Jones as non-executive directors. Mr Casson is deputy divisional
director of general advances Barclays Banking Division Head Office. Mr Jones
is senior risk management director of Barclays Bank London central region.
The company had net rental income of Pounds 18.9m. Its net interest bill was
Pounds 18.6m.
Barclay's involvement in Imry stemmed from 1989 when it financed a highly
leveraged takeover of the company.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Vita blames fall on European
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of closing its lossmaking Spanish operations adversely affected
British Vita, the plastics and foam company, which reported a 39 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits in the half year ending June 30.
Profits fell from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 16.3m on increased sales of Pounds
404.4m (Pounds 372.9m). The shares fell 17p to 243p.
With about two-thirds of its revenues generated from continental Europe, Mr
Duncan Lawton, deputy chairman, said the half year had been very tough.
However, by exiting out of Spain Mr Lawton said the group had 'great
confidence that there will be a turnround on mainland Europe. There is still
some more sorting out to do but the worst is over'.
The cost of disposing of the Spanish operation was Pounds 3.5m. It made an
operating loss of Pounds 2m which was partly responsible for the group's
continental European operations reporting a 27 per cent fall in operating
profits to Pounds 12.4m.
Sterling depreciation, which helped last year's results, was pushing up
D-Mark denominated raw material prices, affecting the group's cellular
operations.
Operating profits from the UK side fell from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 6.7m.
Profits from the international business rose to Pounds 427,000 (Pounds
317,000).
The group plans to continue to cut costs; the workforce has already been
reduced by 350 to 9,000.
With net cash of Pounds 40m left over from last year's rights issue, Mr
Lawton said: 'We are continuing to look at acquisitions but we are not used
to paying high prices.'
Mr Alan Jones, who worked for National Westminster Bank, joins the board as
a non-executive replacing Mr James Ogden, who has retired.
Earnings per share fell from 7.9p to 4p. The interim dividend is raised to
3.65p (3.5p).
COMMENT
With almost 70 per cent of revenues generated from mainland Europe British
Vita is out of step with the UK chemical sector. While it is not unusual to
have a high overseas exposure most UK chemical companies tend to weight it
towards the Commonwealth or North America. British Vita is now paying the
price for being different as its main markets slide deeper into recession.
After closing its Spanish operations its main emphasis must be to control
costs in Germany. The increase in the interim dividend is meant to underline
the company's confidence in the future. However, with forecast annual
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 35m, the shares look expensive - at least in
the short-term - on a prospective multiple of 26.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Takeover bid for Manchester City denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANCIS LEE, the former England footballer who became a millionaire
through developing a successful tissue paper business, yesterday denied he
was making a takeover bid for Manchester City Football Club, where he was
once a famous player.
However, he added that he and two colleagues were willing to invest
substantial funds in the club if shareholders and supporters wished.
It emerged yesterday that it would be almost impossible to mount a hostile
bid for Manchester City. Only 4 per cent of shares are in general ownership.
Mr Peter Swales, the chairman, and Mr Stephen Boler, a kitchens company
owner and close friend, have 38 per cent each.
The remaining 20 per cent is owned by Greenall Whitley, the Warrington
brewer. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenall's chairman, is on the Manchester City
board and is a close supporter of Mr Swales. The club's 1992 accounts show
net assets of Pounds 23m and Mr Swales is predicting profits of about Pounds
1m this year after transfers of players are finalised.
Mr Swales has become unpopular with football fans after sacking Mr Peter
Reid, the club's manager, following a poor start to the new season. After
making it clear yesterday that he would not relinquish control, he said he
was prepared to meet Mr Lee at any time to discuss possible participation.
Mr Lee has been scathing about the running of the club in the past, claiming
that if cups were given for 'cock-ups', Manchester City would by now have a
bulging trophy room.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S orders help Claremont to Pounds 4.42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE ORDERS from Marks and Spencer and two acquisitions helped Claremont
Garments (Holdings), supplier to the high street retailer, lift pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 4.42m in the six months to June 26.
Turnover rose to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 21.7m) but comparisons are difficult
because Claremont, which sells about 93 per cent of its turnover to M&amp;S,
bought J&amp;J Fashions and Alexander Milnes towards the end of the first half
of 1992.
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said M&amp;S had increased its orders from
Claremont, which generally offset the effects of the retailer's Outstanding
Value campaign. M&amp;S has held about 75 per cent of its clothing prices and
cut prices on the remaining quarter.
'There have not been a lot of price increases but we have seen increased
volume and longer runs which means we make the clothes more efficiently.'
Mr Wiegand said orders were up by about 5 per cent compared with this time
last year. 'We are now looking to move into men's wear and will sell
overcoats this autumn, with men's tailored jackets and leisure wear planned
for next spring.'
The company would also like to supply lingerie in future, Mr Wiegand said.
'If the right thing came along we certainly could be acquisitive. We are
trying to broaden our range.'
Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said the company was aiming to bring
its operating margins of 9.8 per cent up to the 13.3 per cent it was making
before its acquisitions last year and it expected further gains from
rationalisations.
Net debt rose from Pounds 3m at the year-end to Pounds 10.5m, including an
Pounds 8.8m convertible loan note, at the halfway stage, giving gearing up
from 15 per cent to 46 per cent over the six months. Net interest charges
rose to Pounds 186,000 (Pounds 86,000).
The board declared an increased interim dividend of 3.6p (3.3p) out of
earnings per share of 7.3p (6.6p).

</HEADLINE>

SHAREHOLDERS in Geevor, one of the UK's oldest mining companies, are a
long-suffering group.
They have provided money several times in recent years with little to show
for it, the last when they took up Pounds 1.25m of loan notes to launch an
unresolved court case against a bank which withdrew banking facilities.
But holders of the equity and loan notes can celebrate yesterday's
disclosure of plans to turn the company from the shell it has become into an
ambitious coal mining company with the assistance of Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
former British Coal commercial director who is to become Geevor's chairman.
From the middle of next month they should be able to trade their shares on
the stock market for the first time since they were suspended 18 months ago.
There is a reasonable chance that the shares will rise from the 4.75p
suspension price if some of Mr Edwards' bids for five British Coal pits
prove successful and he can persuade the market that he can make money out
of them.
He has some hard talking to do, however. The pits he has bid for have been
rejected by British Coal. There has not been a rush of takers for the 19
pits put out to licence by the corporation, which has received about a dozen
bids for eight pits. Five of the bids are from Mr Edwards and another five
are from RJB Mining.
Mr Edwards' confidence stems from his belief that the pits can be profitable
if producing lower tonnages through methods less capital and labour
intensive than those used by British Coal.
He also intends to aim some of his output at parts of the market other than
power stations on which British Coal concentrates. He believes that British
Coal is importing 1.2m tonnes of coal a year and that some of this could be
replaced by UK coal from mines Geevor may buy.
The thinking is similar to that of RJB Mining. Both Edwards and RJB feel the
need for stock market funds to achieve the potential provided by British
Coal's contraction. RJB chose a flotation earlier this year. Mr Edwards has
chosen to move into the shell of Geevor.
'It is a relatively cheap and quick way of getting to the market,' he said
yesterday.
Geevor made its name over 85 years largely through its association with tin
mining. It has been involved with coal only recently and even then at the
periphery of its operations.
It ceased tin mining in 1990 and now has minimal assets. Its main hope of
survival in the last year or so collapsed when AF Budge, the civil
engineering group which had been keeping the company afloat, was forced into
receivership last year.
Since then Smith New Court, Geevor's stockbroker, has been looking for a
company with mining-related interests to take it over. This is because many
of Geevor's institutional shareholders hold the equity in mining funds.
Mr Edwards is not taking the company over - his eventual stake will be about
3 per cent, but his involvement will allow the restructuring necessary to
attempt the transformation in Geevor's fortunes.
He is putting Coal Investments, a subsidiary of Edwards Energy, his
consultancy, into Geevor, to be renamed Coal Investments.
Geevor is also buying UK Mining, a small Welsh company, the assets of which
include the Cwmguili pit. Officially closed by British Coal in 1980 after 20
years of operation, Cwmguili survived under the corporation's ownership
until last year under salvaging arrangements which enabled the continuation
of mining.
It is capable of producing about 100,000 tonnes of coal but needs several
hundred thousand pounds of investment.
Its creditors and shareholders will be given shares in Coal Investments as
will Geevor's current creditors, led by the loan stockholders.
Most of Geevor's creditors have already agreed to take Pounds 10 of new
shares in exchange for every Pounds 100 of debt they hold, according to Mr
Christopher Stainforth, an executive at Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank,
who devised the reconstruction plan and is advising Mr Edwards.
The deal is a comeback for Mr Stainforth, a former director of the broking
firm Phillips &amp; Drew, who is rebuilding his City career following his
acquittal last year in the long-running Blue Arrow trial.
Following the restructuring, there will be a 16-for-1 rights issue to
provide about Pounds 1.75m which can be used to provide the working capital
for Cwmguili and, if necessary, funding for one of the five pits for which
Mr Edwards is bidding.
Mr Stainforth is restructuring the balance sheet with the aim that the
shares will pay a dividend yield of a little less than 10 per cent within
two years at the yet-to-be-determined rights issue price.
Success in bids for any of the other four mines would almost certainly cause
Coal Investments to return to the market for additional equity. Mr
Stainforth said that the company would prefer not to fund future expansion
with borrowings.
At Coal Investments, Mr Edwards will be joined by Mr Brian Nicholls, 53, a
former British Coal employee who has worked in Australia for the last 22
years. He will be director in charge of mining operations.
Mr David Howard, 40, formerly of Ernst and Young will join as finance
director.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional behind Suter's surge to Pounds
30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits of Suter jumped from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 29.6m,
thanks mainly to an exceptional Pounds 19.1m gain on the disposal of the
industrial conglomerate's valves business.
However, the underlying businesses also improved, with trading profit from
continuing operations increasing from Pounds 9m to Pounds 10.9m in the six
months to July 3.
Turnover of the continuing businesses was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 92.2m,
about half the gain arising from currency translation. Overall sales were
slightly down at Pounds 99.1m (Pounds 99.6m), but the current year included
a four-month contribution from valves.
Suter said significant improvements were seen in the environmental division
in the UK and speciality chemicals, while businesses close to the high
street - haircare products, spectacle cases and giftware boxes - also
experienced a notable improvement in demand.
The group said those areas offset less favourable conditions in other areas
 -refrigeration wholesaling, fine chemicals and automotive components,
although individual automotive businesses less exposed to continental
European markets had performed satisfactorily.
Mr David Abell, chairman, said: 'These interim results are pleasing but do
not fully reflect the progress we have made in improving efficiency through
capital investment and reduction of the costs base. The profit potential for
the upturn is bright.'
Mr Abell said he was content, meantime, to monitor developments at James
Wilkes, the troubled engineering group in which Suter has built up a 19.3
per cent stake. Suter would not sell its stake at current price levels, but
could not move until the intention of other large shareholders became
clearer.
Basic earnings per share jumped from 5.5p to 17.5p. Excluding exceptionals,
the fully diluted figure rose from 5.4p to 6.3p. The interim dividend was
increased by 6 per cent to 3.4p (3.2p).

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart in black with Pounds 0.5m and
pays interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIONHEART, the Cheshire-based paint brush manufacturer, home improvements
and retail display systems group, has returned to profit and the dividend
list.
In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax profit was halved to Pounds 518,000
(Pounds 1.1m) - a recovery from the second half of last year when the group
incurred a loss of Pounds 1.97m and passed its final.
It had only resumed paying dividends in 1991 after reconstruction under Mr
Paul Lever, the former chief executive of Crown Paints.
Mr Lever said yesterday that cuts in overheads and improvements in margins
had been underpinned by a small improvement in demand, with sales at Pounds
22.4m (Pounds 21.5m).
All parts of the group were profitable in the first half and he expected
recovery to continue.
Earnings per share were 0.13p (0.48p). The interim dividend is 0.1p, against
0.2p.
Mr Lever said new shower fittings designed by the Croydex subsidiary had
been successfully launched, while Sloane, which makes bespoke merchandising
units, had won strong business in the UK and US among compact disc, video
and entertainments retailers.
Lionheart is 20 per cent owned by Newell, the US paint brush company.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong dollar behind 20% growth to Pounds
26m at Bunzl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG US dollar helped Bunzl, the paper and packaging group, to report
a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the half year to the end of
June.
Profits rose from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 26m on increased sales of Pounds
728.8m (Pounds 632.2m). The shares firmed 1p to 144p.
After the completion of last year's rationalisation, the group is continuing
to look at strategic acquisitions which may require a rights issue.
Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said: 'We have told our shareholders
that if we do a big acquisition we will talk to them first.' He added that
he was confident that the group would continue to grow organically.
Net debt rose to Pounds 113m representing gearing of 51 per cent. Mr Habgood
said borrowings tended to peak at the half year and were inflated by the
strong dollar. The group's debt is mostly dollar denominated. Net interest
payable, however, declined from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 4.4m, mainly because
of the fall in interest rates.
Paper and plastic disposables, assisted by the the strong dollar, reported
increased operating profits of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 13.7m). The continued
growth of overseas cigarette markets helped the cigarette filters side
increase profits to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.1m).
Plastics products, benefiting from a buoyant US automotive sector, turned in
Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.4m).
Mr Pat Dyer, deputy chairman and chairman of the BOC Group is to replace Mr
David Kendall as chairman in October.
Earnings per share rose to 3.9p (3.2p). The interim dividend is maintained
at 1.8p.
COMMENT
Bunzl continues to benefit from its rationalisation programme when it
disposed of unwanted companies accumulated in the eighties and cut costs. By
holding margins in the face of price deflation in the US it is also showing
its metal with existing businesses. While the figures would be less
sparkling without the benefit of the strong dollar, much of the profit
improvement reflects a clearer strategy. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds
56m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.5. With the prospect of a
stronger recovery in the US, where 60 per cent of its revenues are
generated, its premium to the market still looks justified.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Intrum expands to Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTRUM Justitia, the debt collector, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 6.81m to Pounds 7.47m in the six months to June 30, flattered by
the previous period's heavier interest payments and other charges.
Turnover rose to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 41.6m) with the release of a provision
a year ago disguising an increase on continuing operations and acquisitions
from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 41.7m. Operating profits fell to Pounds 7.82m
(Pounds 8.07m).
The company said that allowing for exceptional items and a change in the
treatment of goodwill, pre-tax profit rose 16.7 per cent, operating profit
was up 10 per cent and turnover grew 3.5 per cent.
Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive of the Netherlands-based but London-listed
company, said: 'We have produced a nice profit but we are in our own
recession. When normal companies go into recession they decrease their
business and the outcome at the end is that we get fewer debt collections.'
He added: 'But we see a light in the tunnel. We have already signs in the UK
that there is a recovery particularly for us, the increase in consumer
borrowing, the car industry picking up.'
The board declared an increased gross interim dividend of 1.1p (1p) out of
earnings per share of 5.2p (4.6p restated).

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden improves to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON BOWDEN, the housebuilder and property development group, is
increasing its interim dividend by 6 per cent after reporting higher profits
and turnover underpinned by a 28 per cent increase in house sales in the
first half, writes Paul Taylor.
The Leicester-based group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.8m,
including a Pounds 5.5m pension scheme refund, in the six months to June 30,
compared to Pounds 10.3m.
Turnover increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 81m (Pounds 62.2m) including
Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 48.7m) from housebuilding. Earnings jumped to to 14.3p
(8.9p) and the group is paying an increased interim dividend of 2.65p
(2.5p).
During the period the group sold 825 houses at an average price of Pounds
78,000 compared with 643 houses at Pounds 75,700. Mr David Wilson, chairman
and chief executive, emphasised that the increase in average selling price
reflected the company's policy of selling more larger houses achieved in a
market in which house prices, year on year, declined by about 5 per cent.
Mr Wilson described the results as superb considering that 'the clouds of
economic uncertainty have not entirely disappeared.'
Operating profits for housebuilding rose 12 per cent to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds
7.8m) while property development contributed Pounds 4m (Pounds 3m). However,
Mr Wilson cautioned that profits from property development were uneven and
this level of performance would not be repeated in the second half.
The group continued to expand its land bank in anticipation of a significant
upturn in housebuilding activity. At the end of June the group owned or had
control over 10,300 plots, compared with 8,750 at the end of December.
At the end of June the group had net debt of Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 18.8m)
compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 170.9m.
The shares, which almost doubled in price over the past 12 months, closed up
9p at 449p.
COMMENT
This is a quality stock in an industry ravaged by the recession which should
be able to push higher volume through as the recovery gathers pace. The
company is already outperforming the market and should continue to steal
market share from smaller builders and the housebuilding subsidiaries of
some of the large construction companies. Nevertheless, the share price has
already moved up sharply. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 28m this year
producing earnings of 23.8p and a total dividend of perhaps 9.5p. The stock
is trading on a lofty prospective p/e of 18.8 and should be held.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher debt trims Perkins to Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in interest costs resulting from a near doubling of debt was in
part blamed by Perkins Foods for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.9m
to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to end-June.
However, the interim dividend is being raised from 1.7p to 1.75p from
earnings per share of 4.3p (4.8p).
Lower earnings reflected the increased cost of borrowings, declining
margins, rationalisation costs, the issue of 4m shares to pay deferred
considerations and the relocation of the company's catering meat services.
Net debt increased to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 13m), including convertible loan
notes worth Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5m), with Perkins showing a net cash outflow
of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 7.1m). Interest payments rose to Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 445,000).
Gearing at the end of the half year was 62 per cent (29 per cent) up from 34
per cent at the year end. Perkins said gearing usually peaks in the second
quarter following payment of final dividend and deferred consideration.
Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said gearing should fall to about 50 per
cent by the end of the current year.
Turnover rose to Pounds 198.7m (Pounds 176.3m), reflecting marketing efforts
and a currency translation gain which contributed 15 per cent of the rise.
Margin pressure in the company's continental European operations, however,
meant operating profits virtually flat at Pounds 11.4m.
All four of the company's divisions traded profitably although chilled foods
made lower operating profits of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.85m). The mushrooms
division also returned lower operating profits of Pounds 484,000 (Pounds
583,000).
Frozen foods made profits of Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 6.53m) and fresh produce
made Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 3.14m).

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sterling devaluation helps Laird advance to
Pounds 23.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCHANGE rate movements helped lift first-half pre-tax profits at Laird
Group, the manufacturer of car components and industrial products which
makes more than 80 per cent of its money overseas.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 23.6m. Turnover grew to
Pounds 324m (Pounds 295m). The company said profits had been lifted by
Pounds 2.7m and sales by Pounds 40m through the devaluation of sterling.
Profits also included an exceptional credit of Pounds 3.1m, being Pounds
5.1m from the settlement of a patent dispute, less a Pounds 2m provision for
redundancies expected later this year in the German automotive seals sector.
Operating profits in the seals division fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds
13.2m, mainly because of the recession in the German automotive industry.
Profits in the industrial products division rose to Pounds 9.3m from Pounds
7.3m, while the service industries side - which includes US printing and
plastics distribution - turned in Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.6m).
Earnings per share were 12.3p (11.7p), and the interim dividend was held at
4.2p.
Separately Laird announced yesterday the purchase of the car body seal
business of Happich, the German components maker, for DM24m (Pounds 9.6m)
cash. The business, whose main customers are Mercedes, BMW and Opel, had
turnover last year of DM39m.
COMMENT
Laird's strong presence in the German automotive sector, where it has 50 per
cent of the market for car seals, will be further enhanced by yesterday's
acquisition. However, its heavy dependence on German car production - down
some 25 per cent in the half - is underlined by the fact that only
sterling's devaluation pushed profits and turnover higher during the period.
The currency factor will start to fade in the second half, and the group is
also faced with a slowdown in car production elsewhere in Europe. Its
financial and technical strength in the automotive sector will see it
through the recession, but in terms of profits it will have to run very hard
just to stand still. Meanwhile the non-automotive activities, which the
group is seeking to expand, look a bit of a rag-bag. Earnings this year are
forecast at 20p for a p/e of 16.3, a generous rating for a company so
exposed to the European motor recession.

FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rugby edges ahead to Pounds 30.5m - City
pleased with interim results from two construction companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY reduced net interest income offset higher operating profits in the
first half at Rugby Group, which supplies cement, joinery, steel and glass
to the UK, European and US construction industries.
As a result the group reported only a marginal gain in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 30.5m, in the six months to June 30.
Earnings per share improved to 6.91p (6.86p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 2.85p.
Despite the flat pre-tax profits Rugby's shares gained a further 17p to
close at 279p yesterday.
Operating profits increased by 10.5 per cent to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.1m) on
turnover which grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 360.8m (Pounds 283.7m).
However, net interest income fell to Pounds 493,000 from Pounds 3.06m,
reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on sterling deposits. At the
end of June the group had net cash of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 12.4m).
Rugby, which is Britain's third largest cement manufacturer, said despite
some slight signs of a recovery in the UK, the construction industry
remained depressed and cement sales and profits were both lower.
Cement sales fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 58.3m (Pounds 63.3m) and operating
profits dropped by 15 per cent to Pounds 8.79m (Pounds 10.3m).
However John Carr, the group's UK-based joinery business, posted modest
growth, particularly through recent acquisitions, and managed to lift its
operating profits by nearly 4 per cent to Pounds 7.27m (Pounds 7m) on
turnover ahead 16 per cent to Pounds 64.5m (Pounds 55.6m).
Overall UK operations accounted for Pounds 180.3m (Pounds 149m) of group
turnover and Pounds 18m (Pounds 17.3m) of operating profits.
Mr Geoffrey Higham, chairman, said the Australian results were 'much
improved as the economy recovered,' as was the case in the US.
However, conditions in continental Europe were less robust although the
joinery act-vities continued to advance.
COMMENT
Rugby is a well-run company with a solid balance sheet that has proved it
can manage costs and make profits in even the worst of times, and has
thoroughly deserved its premium rating to date. But the management knows it
needs to make a large acquisition soon in order to make better use of its
cash balances. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 61m look possible this year
producing earnings per share of 14.1p. Yesterday's share price jump puts the
stock on a forward multiple of nearly 20. It is too late for recovery plays,
so Rugby may have to take a few more risks to justify its rating in the
future.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Liberty to grant voting rights, but not just yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE by Liberty, the family-controlled group, towards the enfranchisement
of its non-voting shares has failed to satisfy Mr Brian Myerson, who has so
far failed in his attempts to open up the company.
Liberty, famous for its prints and its central London store, said yesterday
that it had decided 'in principle that enfranchisement would be in the best
interests of the company and all its shareholders'. But in view of
'difficult trading conditions' it would not be appropriate 'at this time'.
The company also argued that the move would be expensive in terms of
dividend because of the need to issue compensatory shares to holders of the
existing voting stock.
Mr Myerson, whose Concerto Capital Corporation holds 15.78 per cent of the
voting shares and about 7.5 per cent of the non-voting, replied: 'This
public stance is completely at odds with the view recently intimated
privately to Concerto by Liberty. Courage and creativity are needed. If
enfranchisement is worth doing, it is worth doing now.'
In June 1992, he requisitioned an egm to demand the recruiting of
non-executives, the splitting of the roles of chairman and chief executive
and the enfranchisement of the non-voting shares.
Liberty has acceded to the first two. On the final one, Mr Patrick Austen,
installed as chief executive in May, said: 'We think we have made a major
step. As far as I know, no other shareholders feel as he does.'
Liberty's pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 602,000, from Pounds 648,000, in
the six months to July 31 - its weaker half. Retailing losses halved to
Pounds 561,000 largely thanks to profits from Japan which rose to Pounds 1m
(from Pounds 761,000). In the UK losses grew to Pounds 311,000 from Pounds
244,000. Converting and wholesaling profits fell to Pounds 325,000, from
Pounds 869,000.
Group turnover was Pounds 37.5m (up from Pounds 36.4m). The interim dividend
was held at 1.85p and earnings per share slipped to 0.34p (from 0.46p) on a
higher tax charge.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Overseas investors miss out on US rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN and Japanese investors have largely missed the latest leg of the
rally in US bond markets - and with good reason.
European investors shifted their attention to European bond markets in early
1992, as those economies slowed down, while Japanese institutions came under
pressure to repatriate funds for investment in their domestic market.
Yen-based funds which remained overweight in Treasuries this year have seen
bond market gains wiped out by currency losses, following the rally in the
yen.
The worldwide bull market in bonds has outstripped expectations and economic
fundamentals remain favourable. But most analysts still think that the rally
has further to go in Europe than in the US, which was the first developed
economy to emerge from recession.
'In textbook terms, 18 months ago was the right time to switch into European
bonds,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier, the
Swiss-owned fund management group. 'Europeans haven't lost anything by
making that move', as European markets have also rallied strongly.
European institutions have, however, adopted an opportunistic approach to
the US market. Mr Robert Gambi, international fixed interest and currency
manager at AMP Asset Management in London, moved from an underweight to a
neutral position in US Treasuries in July, and plans to shift back to an
underweight position shortly. He believes the US bond rally will probably be
over within the next three or four months.
'The US market obviously looks expensive, but any dip in the dollar has made
the US market very attractive for European investors,' said Mr Michael
Burke, a bond economist at Citibank in London.
'There doesn't seem to be anything working against a further rally' in the
US market, said Mr Naoyasu Kawasawa, a fund manager at Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance, Japan's largest non-life insurance company. However, he added
that he was reluctant to invest extra funds because of the foreign exchange
risk.
However, US Treasuries remain a core market for international bond funds.
While the latest leg of the rally has been domestically driven,
international investors may provide some support in any downturn, as they
already perceive themselves to be neutral to underweight.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Growing signs of vertigo as market reaches summit: Fund
managers divided as US bonds soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, more than two years into one of the strongest rallies in the
history of US bond markets, long-term interest rates dropped below 6 per
cent. By the close of trading on Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year
government bond stood at 5.94 per cent, three quarters of a percentage point
lower than it was just six weeks ago, and the lowest in its 16-year life.
But the rally in bonds has been so strong that some analysts are beginning
to fear the market is riding for a fall. Just over a week ago, when bond
yields were hovering slightly above 6 per cent, several brokerage houses
cautioned that the bond market was close to overheating. They argued that
investors were underestimating the strength of the US economy and warned
that bond prices could tumble at the first sign of more robust economic
growth.
One firm, Bear Stearns, said the long end of the bond market was 'severely
overbought', and predicted yields would jump back to more than 6.5 per cent
within a few weeks. Another firm, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, also foresaw
a correction, believing that economic growth in the second half of this year
would be stronger than expected.
The starkest warning has come from Nikko Securities' chief economist in New
York, Mr Robert Brusca. He says inflationary pressures are building up in
the economy more quickly than anyone realises. He also contends that market
expectations are dangerously optimistic about the effectiveness of President
Bill Clinton's first budget in reducing the deficit - a key factor in this
year's rally. He sees bonds as ticking bombs, ready to go off in investors'
faces.
But most US institutional fund managers seem unconcerned about a correction.
There are few signs that they are ready to shift billions of dollars out of
bonds and into stocks, cash or overseas fixed-income assets.
Mr Spike Thorne, who is in charge of fixed-income policy at the investment
group Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark - responsible for about Dollars 60bn (Pounds
39.7bn) of bond funds, is not worried about being caught off guard by a
sharp correction. 'When the bond market makes an important top, it doesn't
do so in a spike formation, but in a table top formation - in other words,
you have a lot of time to see the market changing its direction.'
While Mr Thorne admits that the bond market is not the good value it was
last year, he does not see it peaking just yet. 'The market is focusing on a
lousy business picture for 1994, not just in the US, but in Europe and Japan
as well. There is a worldwide breeze blowing for lower interest rates.'
Mr Gary Coburn, head of fixed-income at the Putnam group which manages
Dollars 57bn of bond funds, says inflationary expectations are the key
factor. 'It is hard to find any evidence of sustained upward price moves. In
fact, you can argue the other way: that we are in a disinflationary
environment. We don't anticipate any imminent changes. There is no need to
run to cash or become very defensive.'
Mr Wayne Lyski, portfolio manager at Alliance Capital, expects US interest
rates to remain stable for the foreseeable future. 'The long-term call is
for rates to remain pretty low.'
His confidence is based on the worldwide economic outlook. 'Almost every
country you look at has a goal of reducing its fiscal deficit, which implies
constant pressure from the fiscal side to keep economic growth lower than it
otherwise would be. And there is a long way to go before this fiscal cycle
plays itself out.'
But Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at the securities house Dean
Witter, is keeping a close eye on the market for any danger signs. 'I'd be
mindful of a correction in a market that has become obviously overheated.'
This is reflected in Dean Witter's asset allocation recommendations to
clients. It suggests the average investor should hold 60 per cent of a
balanced portfolio in stocks and 15 per cent in cash or short-term
instruments. This would leave only 25 per cent in bonds - well below the 35
per cent exposure level that the firm recommends in normal times.
Other investment houses, while still liking bonds, see a better future in
stocks. Goldman, Sachs recently recommended that clients should reduce their
bond holdings from 40 to 30 per cent, and increase their equities exposure
from 55 to 65 per cent.
If there is one factor that might sustain the bond market's rally, it is
liquidity. Billions of dollars continue to pour in, particularly from mutual
funds and banks.
Flows of investors' cash into bond funds jumped 22 per cent in July to a
record Dollars 13bn, while banks, facing weak demand for loans and eager to
improve the quality of their balance sheets, are greatly increasing their
bond holdings. In the year to the end of June, banks upped their holdings of
government securities by 14 per cent to Dollars 704bn.
With so much money flowing in, with the economy fragile and inflation low,
fund managers have few reasons for anxiety about bonds.
As for what might trigger a sudden setback in the market, Mr Thorne muses:
'A significant improvement in the economy, maybe, or bad inflation news, or
a shift to easier fiscal policy. Yet none of these are on the cards at the
moment.'

FT  07 SEP 93 / Thorn EMI warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Thorn EMI fell 21p to 983p yesterday after a circular to
shareholders warned that profits from security and electronics would be no
greater this year than last and that the group's tax rate would increase.
Several analysts complained that the news came in what appeared to be a
routine letter to shareholders about the sale of the group's lighting
division. They said the announcement should have appeared on stock exchange
screens.
In the circular, posted to shareholders last Friday, Sir Colin Southgate,
chairman, said current year profits from the security and electronics
business would be around last year's level of Pounds 1.5m. The group
announced last month that it had failed to sell the defence side of its
electronics business to the General Electric Company.
Sir Colin added that the effect of recent disposals, including lighting,
meant that profits earned in the UK would be lower than last year. As a
result, the group would incur additional unrelieved advance corporation tax
and its overall tax rate would increase. He added that the music and rental
divisions had started the year well and their performance should be in line
with expectations.
Mr Mark Finnie of NatWest Securities said that he had still not received the
circular by the close of stock exchange business yesterday. He noted that SG
Warburg, the group's brokers, appeared to have received the notice in good
time. He said: 'It's very unlike Thorn EMI to have done this sort of thing.'
Mrs Julia Pennington of Barclays de Zoete Wedd had reduced Thorn's expected
full-year pre-tax profits after exceptional items to Pounds 345m from Pounds
370m.
Thorn said yesterday that it had lodged the circular with the stock exchange
last Friday and an announcement had been made that it was available for
inspection. The group said the comments in the circular on likely profits
this year were required under stock exchange rules. 'It is not an
announcement we would have made in the normal course of events,' the group
said.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Builders cautious on upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the UK's leading building materials and housebuilding groups reported
higher profits yesterday, but both urged caution in assessing the recovery.
Wilson Bowden, one of Britain's most successful housebuilders, said it sold
28 per cent more houses in the first half. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds
16.8m, from Pounds 10.3m, with help from a pension surplus.
But Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, said the group had yet to
see any evidence of house price rises and suggested that its higher volumes
in part reflected the group's success in increasing market share.
This year, with the total UK new housing market expected to reach about
170,000 units, he expected his group to sell 1,750 houses, against 1,367
last year.
He believed firmer demand for new houses over the next few months would
enable house-builders to remove the incentives - including discounts and
free carpets - they have been offering. Between now and Christmas he
suggested house prices could firm by about 3 per cent as the special
discounts ended. Next year he believed prices could rise by 5 per cent.
After good house sales in August, he said: 'I think we are moving out of
recession, but we are not there yet.'
Mr Geoffrey Higham, chairman of Rugby Group, the UK's third largest cement
manufacturer, is even more cautious about the construction and building
materials sectors.
Although Rugby reported marginally higher first-half pre-tax profits at
Pounds 30.5m, he noted that the construction industry remained depressed and
the group's UK cement sales and profits were both lower in the first six
months.
He also cautioned that year-on-year comparisons could be misleading because
the 1992 first half was relatively buoyant while the second half was 'a
disaster'.
'There appears to be patchy improvement in the UK economy,' he said, but
added that it would be 1994 before the construction industry showed any
growth.
In the meantime some analysts, such as Mr Mark Stockdale of Warburg
Securities, believe the market has already fully discounted the cyclical
recovery.
Most building and construction stocks have risen sharply over the past 12
months. With more building and construction results due this week, Mr
Stockdale said: 'I think it is too late for recovery plays.'

FT  07 SEP 93 / France demands changes to farm trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE made official its long-standing threat to block a deal on farm trade
between the US and the EC when the government of Mr Edouard Balladur
yesterday formally demanded modifications to the Blair House agreement.
The agreement was reached last November in a paper sent to the European
Commission and Germany. It was not clear if the demands would require a
reopening of the accord.
The only alternative to these 'modifications' is a blanket rejection of any
restraint on the volume of subsidised food exports, the French government
stated in the paper.
France's determination puts at risk the possibility of concluding the
Uruguay Round world trade negotiations by their mid-December deadline. Mr
Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, is expected to tell Mr Balladur of this risk tomorrow.
At a separate meeting, Mr Rene Steichen, the EC agriculture commissioner, is
expected to tell Mr Sutherland that Brussels - which negotiates trade
agreements on the EC's behalf - is determined to avoid reopening Blair
House.
The French paper complains that the accord's provision for a 21 per cent cut
in the volume of subsidised food exports over six years 'responds to a logic
of administered trade'. Cuts should be limited to the amount of subsidy paid
out. Blair House foresees cuts of 36 per cent in total export subsidies.
Under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the EC should
comfortably exceed this.
Paris is still contesting the Commission's assertion that the Blair House
accord is compatible with CAP reform. Brussels says reform will cut the
exportable surplus of cereals - the most inflammatory part of the accord for
France - to 19m tonnes after three years. In its paper, France claims the
surplus will be 15m tonnes above this after six years. It claims Gatt
commitments will require a further overhaul of EC beef regime, which CAP
reform, by general consent, does not do enough to bring into balance.
The Commission is now trying to come up with a formula which addresses the
concerns before the September 20 special council of foreign and agriculture
ministers.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Ford accused of unfair pressure over job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD UK was accused yesterday of using unfair pressure to steer up to 1,200
production and 200 staff employees towards applying for voluntary redundancy
over the next four months.
The job cuts would bring Ford's total employment losses within its UK
operations this year to 2,500. The company said all redundancies would be
voluntary. 'No further action will be taken if the targets are not reached,'
it said.
But in a move which will be seen as designed to encourage early departures,
Ford warned that it was reviewing the terms of its voluntary redundancy
programmes. Future programmes were likely to offer reduced payments, it
said.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, principal negotiator with Ford on behalf of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said the company was seeking to blackmail
employees into accepting current terms. He said Ford's unions would fight
'rigorously' any attempt to reduce payments.
The company has been hit hard by the steep slump this year in continental
new car and light commercial vehicle markets. Its share of total new car
sales has also declined in the UK, where it is market leader.
However, Ford insisted yesterday that the cuts were part of productivity
improvements and not directly related to market conditions.
The biggest intended job losses, of up to 450 hourly paid workers and 50
staff, are at Dagenham, where Ford makes engines, Fiesta cars and vans, kits
for exports and has its general services activities.
Up to 350 hourly paid and 20 staff jobs are intended to be cut at the
Halewood plants on Merseyside, which make transmissions as well as Escorts,
and another 205 jobs are planned to be cut at the Transit van plant at
Southampton.
Of the remaining job cuts, 140 are to be spread over South Wales plants at
Bridgend, Swansea and Treforest, 50 at a Belfast castings plant, 20 at
Basildon Radiator and 15 at the Dunton, Essex, research and development
centre.
Ford made clear that voluntary redundancy programmes could be expected to
continue as part of efficiency improvements. These have already seen Ford's
UK workforce fall from around 72,000 in 1980 to 31,350, while vehicle output
has remained almost steady.
The company is also under severe financial pressure, following combined
losses of about Pounds 1.5bn over the past three years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOOVER UK, the domestic appliances group which launched a disastrous 'free
flights' sales promotion last year, transferred Pounds 28m from its pension
scheme in January, a sum sufficient to cover most of the charges incurred in
connection with the scheme.
The transfer, which netted the company Pounds 16.8m after taxes, was
approved when Mr Bill Foust, the former chairman of Hoover Europe, was
chairman of the pension scheme. Mr Foust was one of two top Hoover
executives sacked in March by US parent company, Maytag, in connection with
the flight offer.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP and chairman of the Commons social security
committee, said on the BBC's Watchdog programme yesterday that his committee
planned to investigate the transfer.
Watchdog said the pension fund's annual report described the transfer as 'a
much-needed injection of funds into the company to provide for the growth
and development of Hoover that we all want'. But Mr Field called the
transfer a 'rip-off for pensioners' and 'an abuse'.
Mr Michael Fallon, Hoover's pensions administrator and company secretary,
said the scheme voted to extract cash following a valuation from the
actuaries which showed a surplus of Pounds 100m at March 31, 1991.
'The actuaries advised us that it would be prudent to distribute Pounds 60m
of that to the company and to employees,' he said.
The Dollars 28m transfer to the company was allowed under scheme rules and
was accompanied by an appropriation of Pounds 32.8m to cover enhanced
benefits to current and deferred pensioners, he said.
Hoover has made no contributions to the scheme since December 1986. Most of
the benefit improvements are to current and deferred pensioners who are only
entitled to annual increases of 3 per cent. Those pensions have been uprated
to 95 per cent of their original purchasing power.
Hoover launched its promotion last year, offering free flights to
international destinations to customers who bought any of its products
priced at more than Pounds 120. The scheme backfired when the company was
deluged by customers who claimed the company had failed to make good its
offer.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Liberty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty's argument for not enfranchising its non-voting shareholders looks
circular. True, the three-to-one proportion of voting to non-voting shares
means that a scrip issue for the voters by way of compensation would lead to
a much higher dividend bill. Great Universal Stores did not face that
problem because only 2 per cent of its shares carried voting rights. Since
the current payout is only just covered by earnings, Liberty has pragmatic
reasons for waiting for profits to recover before taking the plunge.
But the longer an earnings recovery is delayed, the more Liberty will need
an infusion of new blood. Even allowing that family interests would control
the majority of the votes after enfranchisement, pressure from outside
shareholders might encourage change. Mr Patrick Austen, the new chief
executive, deserves a fair crack of the whip. If there is no sign of
progress next year, though, the case for enfranchisement will be compelling
 -even if that means cutting the dividend.
Companies which maintain non-voting shares and are making decent profits
have no excuse for stalling. For non-voting shareholders, there is always a
trade-off between dilution and the benefits of full democracy. When profits
are rising enfranchisement might not seem worth the cost, but the ability to
influence management matters most on the downswing. When it moves to modern
standards of disclosure next year, Schroders will have an opportunity to
overhaul its capital structure too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy has lost the initiative since its privatisation plans were unveiled at
the end of last year. While government has been mired in corruption and
intrigue, privatisation has stalled. Modest trade sales by IRI, the
industrial holding company, mark the limit of success. The timetable now
envisages share offerings in three state-owned banks - Credito Italiano, BCI
and IMI - by the year-end. France will begin its own programme by offering
shares in BNP. So competition for international funds will be intense.
Since the banks need less by way of restructuring than industrial candidates
for privatisation, Italy has little option but to press ahead. The big
savings banks will also have to shepherd private investors out of government
bonds into equities if privatisation is to succeed. Without an established
system of private pension schemes, Italy cannot rely on institutional
investors alone. Fiscal incentives for equity investment might help the
migration of savings, but the process might lack credibility unless the
banks are in private hands.
Although the banks should also feel early benefit from any further cuts in
interest rates, the outlook is far from cloudless. The collapse of Ferruzzi
has raised questions about the credit controls applied by Italian banks. A
restructuring agreement for Ferruzzi would reassure that the banks' exposure
is now under control. An equitable solution might equally soothe nerves
among international investors about the kind of treatment shareholders in
privatised companies might expect.

<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier's acquisition of the assets of Official Airline Guides buffs
up the company's reputation for shrewd, if unspectacular, dealing. The
structure of the deal, in particular, which enables Reed Elsevier to take
advantage of recent changes in US tax legislation typifies its adroitness.
At first glance, the Dollars 417m outlay, representing an exit multiple of
about 13 times stated earnings, seems a full price for a mature business
facing stiff competition from airlines' own electronic reservation systems.
But Reed Elsevier has scope to cut OAG's back office costs by pooling some
operations with its existing ABC World Airways Guide. This should ensure the
deal enhances Reed Elsevier's earnings within the first year. Moreover,
OAG's strong cash flow eases the acquisition's financing.
By buying a parcel of assets rather than the whole business, Reed Elsevier
can also reduce its tax rate. Under section 197 of the new US tax code,
companies which acquire assets for more than their book value are able to
deduct tax on the goodwill they are required to amortise over the following
15 years. This should usefully help Reed Elsevier over the long term, given
the acquisition may contain as much as Dollars 300m of goodwill. The new
wrinkle in the US tax code could affect many other purchasers of branded
goods or intellectual property. Significantly, perhaps, the shares of some
unfashionable US consumer goods stocks have perked up in anticipation that
some tax-efficient asset shuffles may be on the way.

FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Renault takes the wheel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given Volvo's waning fortunes in recent years, it is no surprise that its
French partner should have come out on top in its automotive merger
negotiations. Not only has Renault taken a two-thirds stake in the new
company; the merger comes as Volvo's earnings are starting to improve
following the Swedish krona's devaluation and a period of rigorous
cost-cutting. Renault, now suffering from the downturn in the European car
market, has effectively acquired what might be termed a recovery stock, with
some exposure, albeit small, to the US car market.
The danger is that the new combine will be too ready to believe its own
propaganda about cost benefits. Its claim to be able to generate savings of
FFr30bn by 2000 can be little more than guesswork. The real test will be how
well the companies manage to fuse two different cultures without destroying
the value of the Volvo brand, and how the new model development goes. Many
of the other supposed benefits were available under existing collaboration.
Having decided that it is better to own 35 per cent of a large automotive
company than all of a small one, Volvo is in a curious position. Its
automotive interests will remain its largest part, but it will have no
direct control over them. One assumes that a desire to take charge of its
own destiny will inevitably lead it more deeply into its remaining consumer
goods activities. In that case, a sale of at least its 17.85 per cent direct
stake in the new company would be on the cards eventually. Yesterday's deal
would then be seen as just a stage in a longer farewell to the motor
industry.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Building a Eurocompany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY, with one step back for every two steps forward, a new generation of
truly European companies is taking shape.
Renault-Volvo, announced yesterday, can hope to build on the apparent
success achieved by such recent combinations as Asea Brown Boveri, Reed
Elsevier and GEC Alsthom. It must try to avoid the problems that beset
Carnaud MetalBox and, a couple of decades before, the ill-fated merger
between Dunlop and Pirelli.
The way for such ventures has been paved by two longstanding Anglo-Dutch
success stories, Unilever and Royal Dutch-Shell; and also by the creation of
genuinely pan-European operations by big US companies such as Ford, Exxon
and General Motors.
Now Renault-Volvo seeks similar gains, going further than those permitted by
the two companies' extensive collaboration agreements and
cross-shareholdings.
European mergers must overcome three different barriers. First, they must
resolve the practical questions of legal structure and corporate governance
that bedevil all cross-border entities. The absence of a European company
statute requires elaborate legal structures that add cost and complexity. At
least one now-sundered merger would still be working, in its boss's opinion,
if it had been indissolubly glued together under such a statute. The
continued existence of two national companies made it too easy to break the
venture apart. If an easy exit had not been available, the managers would
have worked harder to solve their disagreements.
Workable structures
Even without a European statute, however, workable structures exist. More
important are shareholders' expectations. The most successful cross-border
ventures come from countries with similar capital markets and investment
horizons. Conversely, the most acrimonious disagreements have arisen between
companies based in Britain, on the one hand, and France or Italy, on the
other. On this issue, Renault-Volvo is heading off into uncharted waters,
not least because the French side is still state-owned.
The second task facing all such ventures is to build in practice the
integrated pan-European business that they seek in theory. Here, American
experience offers a cautionary lesson against over-optimism. Though Ford,
for example, has had a high degree of integration in its European operations
for decades, it is still grappling with the task of creating a single
seamless structure to take a car from the drawing board to the production
line and on to the showroom. The big oil companies are able to operate as
pan-European buyers and refiners of oil; but too often the vagaries of local
demand and regulation hamper integration further downstream.
Subtle barriers
In building their own seamless systems, the new European companies will
benefit from the achievements of the single market programme. But just as
important as the subtle barriers of regulation, market structure and
customer taste are those created by the venture itself. In the early years
of a merged company it is hard to avoid a production plan based, crudely, on
sharing out the work. Only when bosses and workers no longer think in such
terms is the company clearly on its way to success.
That leads to the managers' third task: creating an organisation that is
colour-blind to nationality. Companies have a better chance of making a
success of a cross-border merger if they already practice such an approach -
as at ABB - or if they have a neutral ring-keeper to speak for the company
as a whole. This was the solution Carnaud MetalBox adopted to resolve
damaging polarisation between the group's French and British managers.
As they build a truly European company, the managers involved must always be
aware of the wider markets in which they operate. The creation of the single
European market is merely a symptom of the remorseless pressures of
globalisation which no manufacturer can escape.
It is, perhaps, not the best augury for Renault-Volvo's success that its
creation coincides with another 'voluntary' agreement to restrain Japanese
car exports to Europe. Only when its industries are self-confident enough to
eschew such damaging 'protection' will the European company truly come of
age.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Hard slog to make the marriage work: The merger of Renault
and Volvo can only succeed if market share rises and costs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The intensity of the struggle for survival in the global auto industry is
forcing Renault and Volvo to abandon the luxury of their protracted
engagement. The marriage knot must now be tied - for better or for worse.
By the time the merger is completed on January 1 1994 to form Europe's
second-largest and the world's sixth-biggest auto maker (by production
volume), the courtship will already have lasted for nearly four years.
The sensitivities of the two sets of parents, the French state and Volvo's
Swedish shareholders, could no longer be allowed to block an outright
merger, if the savings of union were not to be frittered away in the
cumbersome bureaucracy of Franco-Swedish joint corporate committees, which
have increasingly run the alliance in the past three years.
The economic environment in which Renault and Volvo are operating has become
harsher since the groups signed a letter of intent in February 1990 to enter
a far-reaching partnership cemented with minority cross-shareholdings.
Now there can be no more half measures. Volvo has spent two of the last
three years in loss, and while Renault achieved an impressive financial
recovery in 1991 and 1992, this year its profits have begun to melt away
again in the face of the precipitous decline in the west European markets.
Volvo has struggled back into the black in the first six months of 1993 but
only after three years of painful restructuring that has included a cut of
nearly a fifth in the workforce of its car operations, the planned closure
of two car plants in Sweden and the closure of a truck plant in the US.
For its part, Renault has suffered an 87 per cent year-on-year drop in
pre-tax profits in the first six months of this year after being in loss in
the final quarter of 1992. In the first half of this year the Volkswagen
group, Ford of Europe and Fiat Auto were all in loss, and PSA
Peugeot-Citroen, Renault's arch domestic rival, is also forecast to report a
loss.
Renault's relative success in the past three years and Volvo's deep problems
are reflected in shareholding arrangements agreed yesterday.
What began in 1990 as a 50-50 alliance between would-be equals, has emerged
as a 65-35 per cent arrangement in Renault's favour. 'The shareholding
arrangement of the new group corresponds to the relative worth of each
partner as valued today,' said Renault. (While all of Renault is included
within the merged Renault-Volvo, it must be remembered, the group includes
only Volvo's automotive operations. The Volvo parent company retains
separately its marine and aero engine and food processing businesses and its
pharmaceutical interests.)
'If you want to win you must go faster,' said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman
and chief executive of Renault, who will now become chief executive of
Renault-Volvo. 'The advantage of a complete merger is simplicity and speed.
Agreement between two companies does not go as fast as managing a single
group. Speed is of the essence, we must go beyond the limits of the
co-operation to date.'
Renault and Volvo claimed yesterday that the merger could generate savings
of about FFr30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) before the year 2000 as costs are shared
over a larger volume of production. 'The potential savings resulting from a
merger are significantly greater than what could be achieved within the
present alliance,' the companies said.
Adding to the financial and industrial muscle of the new group is the way
Renault and Volvo largely complement each other in the car market. Renault,
the volume carmaker whose Clio model was Europe's best-selling small car
last year, is strongest in southern Europe, but with a growing presence in
Germany and the UK. Renault is the leader in the European light commercial
vehicle market, where Volvo is absent.
The Swedish group, primarily a maker of large, executive cars, is more
focused on northern Europe, and has held on to a significant presence - by
European standards - in the North American car market, where Renault has
been absent since it sold its troubled stake in American Motors to Chrysler
in 1987.
It is a different story in the heavy commercial vehicle industry, where
Volvo and Renault compete directly both in Europe and in North America.
Together they will represent the world's third-largest truckmaker (above 6
tonnes gross vehicle weight) behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany and Isuzu of
Japan, the second-largest heavy truckmaker (above 15 tonnes) and the
second-largest bus and coach maker behind Mercedes-Benz.
Whatever the muscle of the new group, however, the merger will only succeed
if one plus one can equal more than two in market share and less than two in
costs. The obstacles in the way of successful rationalisation remain
formidable, and the benefits will not be won easily. 'Management literature
is full of warnings against big mergers,' admitted Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar,
chairman of Volvo who will also chair the supervisory board of Renault-Volvo
Automotive. 'There are mergers that have turned sour, but there are many
examples of success too. Being aware of the dangers, we can avoid many of
the pitfalls.
'A major strength is that we have worked together in the alliance. It is a
learning experience that few other corporations have had.'
The big economies of scale will only be gained when the merged Renault-Volvo
has succeeded in rationalising and integrating the respective car and truck
ranges of the two companies. The group will try to ensure that its public
face to the customers is little changed. It will fight intensely to keep the
Renault and Volvo marques distinct to protect the value of the names.
Showrooms and dealer networks will remain apart and the design and
engineering departments will aim to make the products look different.
Under the metal skin of the products and behind the showroom facade all must
change radically, however, as Renault-Volvo products seek to use as many
common components as possible, to use common suppliers, common product
platforms, common logistics, transport and computer systems, common
media-buying for advertising and common offices for marketing and
distribution.
Changing product generations can take more than a decade to complete. Volvo
is at the start of the launch of a heavy truck range, which has taken seven
years and an investment of SKr6.5bn to develop. The existing heavy truck
range was launched in 1977, and the new one will not be replaced until well
into the next decade.
It took the Peugeot group more than a decade to rationalise and integrate
its Peugeot and Citroen ranges to the point where today they all have common
platforms, engines and gearboxes, while maintaining a separate market
identity.
Moreover, in the past three years of alliance, Renault and Volvo have
already discovered that it has been more difficult to win synergy gains from
the previously rival truck operations than from the more complementary car
businesses. It is in trucks and buses that the biggest rationalisation gains
could probably be found, but it is here that the turf wars are already most
fierce.
The existing alliance was ill-suited to end such in-fighting with its
ungainly structure of endless committees from the joint policy general
committee (JPGC) to the joint car technical co-ordination committee (JCTCC),
the joint truck technical co-ordination committee (JTTCC) and the Economic
Interest Groupings (EIGs) for purchasing and quality.
The unified management will have to move quickly - but with great delicacy -
to break this structure and create a common culture.
At least when Peugeot and Citroen were merged there was a common language.
Now the comrmon language of the group will be foreign to both, namely
English. Some 90 per cent of Renault language training is now being devoted
to English 'to help improve communications between the two companies'. The
cultural divide is so thorny that another Renault-Volvo co-ordination effort
is already trying to cope with the problem of summer holidays. Volvo closes
in July and Renault in August.
As Renault-Volvo Automotive fights to survive in the global auto industry of
the next century, the devil will be in the detail as the partners try to
make their marriage last.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Big Three close ranks against the club: Guy de Jonquieres
argues for competition at the grocer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever businessmen protest about lack of a 'level playing field',
consumers should be on their guard. Such complaints turn out all too often
to be thinly veiled petitions for special treatment or relief from
competitive problems of producers' own making.
The latest aficionados of football metaphors are J. Sainsbury, Tesco and
Argyll, Britain's three largest supermarket chains, which have ganged up to
challenge in the High Court plans by Costco, a leading US operator of
cut-price warehouse clubs, to open its first UK outlet.
The supermarkets are crying foul because Costco has been granted local
authority planning permission that does not classify it as a retailer.
That, they argue, gives the company an unfair advantage over established
shopkeepers, who must pay much higher prices for sites earmarked
specifically for retailing and are subject to more onerous bureaucratic
procedures. All the Big Three say they are asking for is clear rules, fairly
enforced.
Their high moral tone is curiously at odds with their stampede two years ago
to open their stores on Sundays, in defiance of an even more confused legal
situation. But it also masks a more fundamental inconsistency. For the
playing field on which the large supermarkets compete - and which they have
helped to shape - is far from level. Increasingly, it has been to their
advantage.
The Big Three have often been accused of earning immoderate profits by
keeping food prices high, on the grounds that their pre-tax margins are
double or more those of continental food retailers. They, in turn, have
responded that such comparisons are flawed, and have insisted that they be
judged by their return on capital, which is much closer to levels across the
Channel.
The problem with this argument is that the amounts of capital they invest
are vastly greater - about five times more per square foot of store area
than French supermarkets, according to a recent study by stockbrokers UBS.
In a race to open ever more lavish superstores, costing as much as Pounds
40m each, the Big Three have in the past five years invested almost Pounds
10bn - about 2.5 per cent of total fixed capital formation by the private
sector.
Much of this sum reflects freehold property costs, which can account for
half or more of the total cost of a superstore. But it is too easy just to
blame a shortage of suitable land. The Big Three have also energetically bid
up property prices. Their readiness to pay what other retailers regard as
exorbitant figures has increasingly meant they have been the only bidders
for prime sites.
In effect, financial muscle has become as important as product range and
marketing skills in determining the industry pecking order. Intentionally or
not, high property prices have raised barriers to entry and hastened the
exit of weaker players. Recent government efforts to discourage further
out-of-town retail developments seem likely to discriminate in favour of
those already operating by sheltering them from fresh competition.
Always provided, of course, that food superstores remain as big
moneyspinners as their owners hope. Their ability to do so depends heavily
on continuing to achieve the exceptionally high sales volumes per square
foot needed to recoup their capital costs. That in turn means enticing large
numbers of affluent and mobile consumers to do more and more of their
shopping - for items which have expanded to include toiletries, petrol and
magazines, as well as groceries - under one roof.
Increased UK competition from hard discounters, such as Aldi of Germany,
which sell groceries at bargain-basement prices, poses a threat to this
formula. On its own, the threat is probably containable while such stores
mostly continue to sell a narrow range of goods from dingy high-street
premises frequented by poorer consumers. But warehouse clubs, offering a
huge array of products, from baked beans to video-recorders, at even lower
prices from vast hangars, seem likely to compete for a far bigger share of
superstore customers' disposable income.
For the Big Three, that possibility raises the dread prospect that all the
capital they have sunk in superstores will not produce a goldmine, but a
bottomless pit. While they await the outcome of the High Court
deliberations, the rest of us may care to ponder what kind of a regulatory
regime encourages grocers to compete so strenuously to enrich land owners,
and how much better off we might be if it did not.

As we all know, God - or god, depending on your faith - moves in mysterious
ways.
But there is little mystery in the Church of England's latest appointment,
that of the Right Reverend John Hind, 48, as the new bishop of Europe.
For Hind appears to have several useful qualifications for the job,
including an interest in languages and physical fitness. Currently bishop of
Horsham, Hind will need plenty of stamina to rove across one of the largest
dioceses around.
Canon David Palmer, who runs the European diocese gazette, says Hind's beat
will cover 'Scandinavia to Casablanca and from Madeira to Ankara', 110
chaplaincies altogether.
Clerics throughout Europe must be hoping Hind does not find much need of his
other hobby - he is a Black Belt in judo.

Good news for holiday-makers - both royal and non-royal - going to Bali:
there is more room to play. Population density has shrunk from 815 to 503
people per square kilometre because the number of square kilometres has
increased by 62 per cent to 539,458.
While the economy of Indonesia grew by 6 per cent in 1992, the number of
islands in the world's largest archipelago rose by 28 per cent to 17,508.
But although it is a highly volcanic region and islands can literally come
and go, this latest surge is probably the result of satellite photography,
which allowed a more accurate count.
But an official of the government's National Development Information Office
explains: 'Another suspicion is that it depends on the level of the tide.
Don't plan to travel to most of them,' he adds.

<TEXT>
It's not yet the stuff of schoolboy fiction. Francis Lee, former England
football star, denies wanting to buy up Manchester City, his old club,
despite tabloid rumours to the contrary.
Lee was gruff yesterday about gossip suggesting he was making an Pounds 8m
hostile bid, though he did say his substantial investment might be
available, if shareholders and supporters were interested.
Lee scored on his debut, in 1960 aged 16, for Bolton Wanderers. Two years
later he transferred to City. But despite his soccer talents, he quickly
spotted he might need another way of making a living. After asking for a pay
rise, the Bolton manager of the day told him he was merely a labourer.
Lee thus started trading in waste paper, quickly realising the big money was
in recycling it as toilet tissue. In 1984, he sold out to Hazlewood for
Pounds 8m. On the Hazlewood main board, he now finds his greatest
professional joy in training horses at his highly successful racing stable
in Cheshire.

Will the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry - a new body which kicks
off today with the mission of bolstering the UK's non-service sector - be
just another think tank, or will it genuinely help to galvanise the economy?
It has an impressive pedigree, with corporate backers including blue-chip
companies such as British Airways, Glaxo and Unilever.
And its governing council is staffed by some of the UK's more eminent
business figures, led by Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman of National Power
and former president of the Confederation of British Industry. Its council
includes former FT editor Sir Geoffrey Owen (now director of the LSE's
centre for economic performance); Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith
New Court; and Douglas McWilliams, the CBI's former chief economist.
McWilliams, 41, this year left the CBI to set up his own think tank, the
Centre for Economics and Business. He says that part of his outfit's
services to companies is advising how to hire outside consultancies for
important but non-core activities.
His advice to FMI will no doubt come in useful. It can also be guaranteed a
hearing. For his father, Sir Francis McWilliams, will, on retiring from his
year as London's Lord Mayor in November, become chairman of the FMI's
trustees.

<TEXT>
Competition between five US southern states to get a new Mercedes-Benz plant
with a price tag of some Dollars 300m is warming up, but Governor Zell
Miller of Georgia may have stolen a march on his rivals by going to
Stuttgart today.
Miller would naturally love to have both the plant and the 1,500 jobs that
are likely to come with it.
But his devotion to the cause has an extra dimension; he has just announced
his intention to run for re-election next year. What better way of starting
his campaign than by winning a foreign investment plum like Mercedes?
In the past Miller has opposed offering financial incentives to investors in
Georgia, unlike the other suitors for Mercedes' hand - North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. In 1992 South Carolina persuaded BMW to
site a new factory there; incentives such as land, tax-breaks and worker
training, worth some Dollars 100m, are thought to have considerably helped
its cause.
But Miller may be able to call upon powers other than the purely financial.
He is after all very close to President Bill Clinton, and he made a key
speech to the Democratic convention which nominated Clinton.
Moreover, Mercedes-Benz may never know when it needs a friend in the White
House, particularly in these troubled times for the world's automobile
business. Miller should learn later this month whether his powers of
persuasion have been successful.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's tricky agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY one expectation arose from Mr Bill Clinton's election last November
it was that, as a Democrat, he could break the legislative 'gridlock' by
working with the majority in both houses of Congress. Yet his main
achievement since taking office has been to scrape together, after months of
lobbying, the narrowest of congressional majorities for a distinctly
unadventurous budget. Within a few months now the political horizon will be
dominated by next year's congressional elections. If the president has not
by then firmly established his authority and used it to impose his own
agenda he will be in severe danger of becoming the third out of the last
four presidents to leave office after only one term.
The US political season opens today with a press conference at which the
vice-president, Mr Al Gore, will announce his proposals for 'reinventing
government'. In European terms this is partly about subsidiarity - letting
lower-level civil servants get on with their jobs and take decisions without
for ever referring to higher authority. In British terms it also contains a
dash of 'citizen's charter' - giving taxpayers guarantees of quicker and
better service for their bucks. In American terms there is something even
more familiar about it: a promise to cut the deficit by eliminating waste.
Such savings have generally proved illusory in the past. Perhaps Mr Gore
will do better, but in any case his performance will only be the hors
d'oeuvre. The substantial items on Mr Clinton's menu are healthcare and the
North American free trade agreement.
Fragmented consensus
Health is the issue he has made peculiarly his own. He believes the
uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs is the single most urgent
problem facing America, a view that is widely shared, not least in the
business community. But, as the budget deficit issue shows, it is not enough
to achieve consensus on the urgency or importance of a problem in general
terms. Consensus quickly fragments when specific groups discover the problem
is to be solved at their expense. The chances against Mr Clinton achieving a
workable healthcare package on the first try do not seem promising.
But at least he will try. There is no danger of that issue going by default.
It would be agreeable to say the same, with the same confidence, about the
issue of free trade, whether in the North American regional context or the
broader one of Gatt.
Deserves credit
Certainly Mr Clinton is on record as favouring both ratification of Nafta
and an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. He deserves much of the credit
for the breakthrough achieved in Tokyo in July, and he can hardly be blamed
if it is sabotaged by French threats to veto the Blair House agreement on
agriculture which the EC negotiated with his predecessor. But while it is
primarily for Europeans to deal with that European problem, there are many
other items in the round still to be agreed, and they are unlikely to be so
by the December deadline without intensive political involvement at the
highest level.
Some US businessmen see Nafta as an alternative to the Uruguay Round, even a
chance to punish Europe with a taste of its own regional protectionist
medicine. That would be a good reason for opposing it, but there is little
or nothing in the agreement to justify such an interpretation.
Those who oppose Nafta in the US, from Mr Ross Perot to Mr Ralph Nader and
the environmental movement, the trade unions, and an awkwardly large number
of Democratic congressmen, do so for other reasons. Mr Clinton has not
surrendered to these lobbies, but his handling of them has dismayed the
treaty's supporters.
That issue now cries out for real leadership, as do a number of foreign
policy issues: not least the Bosnian imbroglio, where Mr Clinton's
indecision cannot be excused by, even if it does not in turn excuse, the
feebleness of his European allies. At home and abroad, he is now being
compared with his last Democratic predecessor, Mr Jimmy Carter. If - as may
be safely assumed - Mr Clinton strongly dislikes that comparison, he must
realise he has only a short time left in which to prove it wrong.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ETIENNE DANOIS-MARICQ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent ousting of Mr Aguilo, chairman of Iberia (International
Company News, September 1), is certainly welcomed by a number of frequent
flyers resident in Spain. Being exposed to sub-standard service and
incidents, including aircraft departures without all passengers checked in,
last-minute changes to published schedules, quasi-punitive pricing practices
and failure to refund promptly unused full-fare tickets (more than six
months) is irritating, especially since there is, for all practical
purposes, no alternative carrier on most Spanish routes.
Unlike Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways, who has taken pains to respond
to written communications concerning major service incidents, Mr Aguilo has
remained silent when I have written to him in an ultimate attempt to have
incidents resolved.
Until the European Commission's DG4 takes effective steps at crushing
Iberia's abuse of monopoly power, we can only hope that Mr Aguilo's
successor will introduce customer service on Iberia's agenda.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Prestige in the pipeline: A dispute between Turkey and
Russia over oil export routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey and Russia are locking horns over the future of a multimillion-dollar
project to take central Asia's oil to western markets. The outcome of the
struggle will help shape the future economic alliances of the region.
The importance of the venture is underlined by tomorrow's scheduled visit to
Moscow by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, to meet President
Boris Yeltsin. In her first foreign trip, she is expected to focus on
Turkish concerns over conflict in the Caucasus, and to enlist Russian
backing for Turkey's planned oil pipeline from Baku in eastern Azerbaijan to
the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan (see map).
Turkey, a newcomer to regional influence, is seeking to capitalise on its
linguistic and ethnic ties with the Turkish-speaking republics; Russia,
historically the colonial power, is trying to reaffirm its control over its
former empire. The planned pipeline has thrown these tensions into relief.
Negotiations are under way between Azerbaijan, Turkey and several western
oil companies to construct the USDollars 1.4bn pipeline, financed mainly by
British Petroleum, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott of the US, and
Statoil of Norway.
The alternative oil route to the west is via the existing Soviet-built
pipelines to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, from where tankers
take the oil through the Bosporus straits to Mediterranean refineries. The
pipeline would need to be developed and extended as new oilfields come on
stream.
'Every route has it difficulties,' said a western oil executive. The oil
companies say the present Bosporus route is cheaper and would not require
such large investment. For the cash-strapped central Asian republics, the
Bosporus route is also attractive - it offers the prospect of virtually
immediate oil revenues because much of the pipeline network is already in
place.
There are practical reasons for the misgivings: the Turkish pipeline would
have to cross Georgia, Armenia or Iran, all of which would present
considerable political risks for any lender to the project. In addition, a
large section of the pipeline would have to be built through south-east
Turkey, where Turkish Kurds are fighting for independence.
Last week Turkey stepped up the diplomatic pressure by threatening to
introduce new restrictions on tankers of more than 150 metres in length
passing though the Bosporus. Turkish foreign minister Mr Hikmet Cetin warned
that Turkey would seek a revision of the 1936 Montreux Convention under
which merchant vessels in peacetime are ensured unhindered passage through
the straits.
The effect of any curbs on traffic would add costly delays to the tankers
shipping oil from Novorossiysk and could force the oil companies to look
more favourably on the Turkish pipeline proposal.
Turkey is justifying its planned restrictions by citing environmental
concerns over the increase in tanker traffic that would run through the
middle of Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, if its pipeline does not get the
go-ahead. 'We can't take that environmental risk,' said Mr Cetin. 'If the
only solution is to change Montreux, we will seek to change it.'
Turkish officials have repeatedly warned about congestion in the Bosporus
because of growing freight use by the newly independent Black Sea states,
all dependent on this route for access to western markets. The number of
vessels passing through the Bosporus last year is estimated at 50,000, an
increase of 10 per cent over 1991.
According to observers, about 5m tonnes of crude oil is shipped annually
through the straits, a figure that will rise to 45m-50m tonnes if oil from
new finds in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan starts flowing through Novorossiysk.
The Istanbul port authorities already have to close the Bosporus for safety
reasons to other traffic every time a tanker is in transit.
Despite Turkey's concerns, western diplomats say there would be little
support among other signatories for a complete revision of Montreux, a broad
agreement which achieves a delicate balance of interests, and which took 13
years to finalise. Minor amendments might be possible. 'We believe Turkey
has a legitimate concern to alter Montreux slightly,' said one western
observer.
There is a great deal more at stake than regulating tanker traffic, however.
The pipeline dispute comes at an awkward time, as Turkey seeks Russia's
co-operation to bring peace to the war-ravaged Caucasus.
The project is also seen as the economic lifeline of the region and the
centrepiece of a more ambitious Turkish foreign policy. Until now the lack
of a common land border with the central Asian republics, and no shared
infrastructure, have placed physical limits on Turkish efforts at economic
expansion eastwards.
The pipeline itself would bring in an estimated USDollars 500m a year in
tariff revenues. Of equal significance is the unprecedented commercial
opportunity it offers for Turkish businessmen to forge trade links with the
republics. For instance, Turkey might take Azeri oil in exchange for
manufactured goods and construction contracts.
At the moment, Turkish officials are concentrating on wooing Azerbaijan. If
their efforts are successful, Kazakhstan may be persuaded to redirect its
oil to the Turkish route. This could pave the way for a separate gas
pipeline to take both Kazakh gas and the vast gas reserves of Turkmenistan
to Europe.
For Russia, the prospect of losing control over the natural resource exports
of former satellites is worrying. The continued use of Russian ports and
refineries makes the republics dependent on Moscow. The Kazakhs already have
an agreement with Chevron, the US oil company, to develop the vast Tengiz
field, and ship the oil via Novorossiysk. Bechtel of the US has a contract
to build a pipeline from Tengiz to Novorossiysk, linking with the existing
facility from Baku to Grozny.
Any change by Turkey in the conditions applying to tankers transiting the
Bosporus would be viewed as a provocation by Russia, which might pursue the
issue with the International Maritime Organisation, the London-based UN body
that handles maritime disputes.
Amendments to Montreux would prejudice relations not just with Moscow, but
with all the Black Sea states. This could jeopardise the careful groundwork
already undertaken to set up the Black Sea Economic Co-operation forum,
which aims to cement trade links throughout the area.
Turkey may have been slow to understand the depth of Russia's determination
to hang on to control of central Asia's oil exports. In pushing for the
pipeline, the Turks have challenged Russian economic power at a time when
Moscow, too, is desperate for the hard currency that accrues from such a
project.
Ultimately, however, Turkey may be the winner. It is commiting intense
diplomatic efforts to persuading western governments to support its case for
restricting access to the Bosporus, while continuing to negotiate for the
pipeline with Azerbaijan. A decision on the project may be several months
away - but on it rests Turkey's regional prestige.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Marx the musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you find an ancient Labour party song sheet, price tuppence, in your
attic, cherish it. Mine came down the loft ladder during the summer. It is
enjoyable, yet it carries a sting. It makes you weep as you laugh. It is a
musical history of the century of collectivism that has now reached its end.
What I could do with this material] Andrew Lloyd Webber, eat your heart out:
The people's flag is deepest red: it left the Labour movement dead. Too
cruel? Try arise, ye starvelings from your slumbers - and please join up in
larger numbers.
Enough tampering. This ancient hymnal contains many popular ditties, the
property of no political party. Yet it should be preserved in a museum of
the 20th century, if only for its red numbers. The exhortation in the
Italian 'Bandiera Rosa' is clumsily translated as raise then the scarlet
flag triumphantly. Triumph? Phooey. The little-known 'Dump the Bosses off
your Back' promises that all the agonies you suffer/you can end with one
good whack. We'll pass that by. The song ascribed to the Amalgamated
Engineering Union, which I bet you cannot even whistle, has a chorus
beginning strong as the steel which we shape with precision . . .
It is impossible not to mock, yet it is uncomfortable to do so. Millions of
good people sang such tunes, and believed the promises in their seductive
rhymes. The suffering they record was genuine; many who sought to improve
the condition of the poor, or of badly treated employees, were, every now
and then, just for a moment, heroes. Shall we only hope for heaven when
we're dead? asks Ralph Chaplin's 'The Commonwealth of Toil'. Shall we
stagger on beneath their heavy load? Such rhetoric got nowhere. It rescued
nobody. I do not think the lyricist of the Internationale (the one about ye
starvelings arising) meant what you and I will read into the following
lines: for reason in revolt now thunders/and at last ends the age of cant.
Reason certainly has thundered, and ended the age of socialist cant.
In Britain it has also put the kibosh on trade unions and made it difficult
for Labour to win a general election. The people's party continues to be
branded by the sentiments ex-pressed in its old hymns. It has not adapted
itself to the new political marketplace. In spite of everything done since
1983 to shed voter-repelling policies, its image remains as it was, that of
an organisation run by collectivists who will hold you back. This
observation is supported by qualitative survey research published by the
Fabians a year ago. A follow-up study, whose full results will be available
next week, rams the point home.
One reason why Labour is still regarded as a loser by a majority of the
electorate is the association of the party with the trade unions. This hurts
both sides. In another recent Fabian pamphlet*, Philip Bassett and Alan Cave
quote survey evidence to the effect that 'even among members of a highly
Labour-loyal union, trade union support for Labour is the single-largest
deterrent for employees considering union membership'. Labour did pick up 1
1/2 m more votes in last year's general election than it did in 1987, but
that still left it 1 1/2 m behind its winning performance in 1966. The
Conservative popular vote last year was the highest in its history, and 2
1/2 m ahead of Labour.
The unions are mortally afflicted. During the 1980s they lost members at
twice the rate of the decline in employment. Union membership is down from a
peak of 13m to around 8 1/2 m now, and falling rapidly. In a fresh analysis
of their prospects, Mr Graham Mather of the European Policy Forum suggests
that Britain's unions are 'retreating into a ghetto of white-collar, public
ser-vice workers'. Barely a quarter of their members are in manufacturing;
just over half have full-time white-collar jobs. 'Alarmingly for the unions,
these are precisely the areas likely to see the next wave of job shedding,'
notes Mr Mather.
This closes a new trap around Labour. If the party stands for anything it is
for more government activity. It clearly feels obliged to oppose every cut
in this or that public programme put forward by the government. It will
obstruct privatisation, competitive tendering, hiving off to agencies, and
the other devices used by the Conservatives for the unstated purpose of
breaking the public sector unions. Whatever Labour's leaders say, that
approach is translated by most people into a plan to offer further protected
jobs for the unions' boys and girls, and thus more collective spending.
Prominent among Labour's perceived masters are some of the public sector
unions, the potential beneficiaries of its administrative approach. It is a
deadly circle.
The response of the party and possibly a majority of the unions to this dire
emergency is that of non-swimmers clinging to one another in choppy seas.
They are unable to part, unable to tread water, incapable of any movements
save those which make their predicament worse. No, they say, even those who
see the light, we do not want to break the links between unions and party;
we want to tighten them. It is a noose that they are tightening. Mr Bill
Jordan of the engineering union has observed that voters will reason that,
if trade union leaders can dictate the way John Smith runs his party, then
they would surely dictate the way he runs his government.
Mr Smith will address the Trades Union Congress at its meeting in Brighton
today. If he does not reiterate his support for selection of Labour's
parliamentary candidates by paid-up party members alone, the explanation
will be that the TUC is the wrong place to do that, since it includes unions
not affiliated to the party. Yet the Labour leader's highest aim is to cut
away the collective trade union vote in the constituencies. He has already
abandoned plans to exclude trade unions from the procedure for electing the
leader of the party. The union bloc vote at Labour's conference will be
slowly circumscribed, but it will remain overwhelming for the rest of this
century.
It is not good enough. No matter how badly the Tories flounder, the
principal opposition party is not modernising itself as extensively or
rapidly as it needs to. For Labour and the unions the song is ended, but the
melody lingers on. Do you hear it? It is a dirge.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GILL STURDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'Is there anything that governments can do to reassert control of the
business cycle?', asked your leader, 'Slow-motion economics' (September 4).
Would that they got rid of the cursed thing instead]
Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the venerable (but less old than the
business cycle) Bank of England, has called for three years of output growth
faster than the rate of inflation. That would be a good start, exceeding
more than half the normal length of a cyclical upswing, and go a long way to
ensure that the subsequent output growth too was sustained.
Can we have perpetual motion in one country when others still cling to their
old cyclical ways? Let the Old Lady and the new chancellor jointly show the

Sir, While I do not seek to justify tax evasion in any form ('The
temptations of forbidden fruit', August 26), I am surprised that your
contributor did not mention the substantial benefits which accrue to the
Revenue from undisclosed earnings. If those involved live up to their
supposed means (buying extra bottles of highly taxed whisky, for example),
the net loss may be modest. An argument for an increase in excise duties
perhaps?

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Private prisons', was well balanced and full of good
sense. The privatisation experiment has thrown up more questions than it
answers. We need to know more and a moratorium during a period of reflection
would be commendably reassuring.
It is extraordinary that a government which has won itself a reputation for
deafness rather than deftness (some have diagnosed arrogance) should push on
blindly with more private prisons. Here we have in the making another half
cocked and reckless adventure which has all the politically explosive
potential of the poll tax, the erstwhile unseeing faith in the ERM and
education reforms now abandoned.
Why do they keep on doing it?

   From Mr DEREK A COGGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Private prisons' (September 2), discussed the wisdom
of privately run prisons. There has been considerable debate in recent
months regarding the treatment of criminals, with attitudes hardening in the
direction of longer prison sentences, the argument being that those
convicted cannot reoffend when locked up.
However, any system which neglects the problem of reoffending must be barren
in nature.
Therefore, if prisons are to be run privately under contract, then one
element of the contract should be rewards/penalties - for the contractor -
for those prisoners, who once released, do not/do reoffend. It would then be
up to the contractors to decide how the prison environment might be managed
to achieve this objective and maximise contractors' rewards.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Optimist in search of realism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In answering Professor Furnham's questionnaire, 'Are you an optimistic
or pessimistic boss?' (September 1), my score of 21 puts me firmly in the
optimist's camp.
The professor's 15 questions, however, must have caused many readers to
think that 'realistic' or 'unrealistic' would be a more suitable tag for
these bosses, according to the answers they gave and the final score totals
achieved. Anyone, for instance, who 'strongly agrees' with the question,
'The most effective supervisor is one who gets the results management
expects, regardless of the methods used in handling people', is not merely
being pessimistic but totally unrealistic.
It would be just such an unrealistic management attitude which would cause
staff morale to flag and, ergo, company under-performance.
Professor Furnham also refers to 'soft' management techniques and, although
he does not say what these might be, he would doubtless agree that such
techniques would come from what he calls the 'optimistic' bosses.
Again I would say that these are the 'enlightened or realistic' bosses who
understand the psychology of motivation. The use of staff incentives and
motivation programmes continually proves not to be an optimistic or soft
option.
Indeed, by the results achieved, this enlightened style of management proves
to be the realistic one.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ministers must offer Africa debt
lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEWART WALLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent and timely supplement, 'Africa, a continent at stake'
(September 1), rightly highlights the fact that IMF/World Bank Structural
Adjustment Programmes have fallen short of expectations and that few
problems in Africa are more burdensome and debilitating than external debt.
The supplement should be compulsory reading for the western finance
ministers attending this month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting in
Washington. A potential African recovery hangs by a thread. The meeting has
the power to throw Africa either a lifeline or a noose.
The last G7 summit in Tokyo failed to act on Africa's crushing debt. Africa
cannot afford a similar response from the IMF/World Bank meeting. The issue
is simple: if world leaders want to lead, then they have to deal decisively
with world problems.

<TEXT>
Sir, May I inform your correspondent Dr Purshouse (Letters, September 3)
that the original exporting was from France to America? We Disneys were
D'Isigny, Isigny being a dairying place in Normandy. The day you published
Purshouse's letter I had a postcard from a Disney family member visiting
this home town of our ancestors.
Two brothers came over with William the Conqueror. The family lived at
Norton Disney in Lincolnshire for 600 years. Then two brothers in the 17th
century moved to Ireland. Walt Disney was descended from one of these two.
He was very interested in the family and I was on a number of occasions,
many years ago, asked by mutual cousins to provide them with family
information to pass on to him.
If the French really do so much object to Mickey Mouse's return to the land
of his ancestral origin, could this perhaps be a latter-day example of a
prophet being without honour in his own country?

FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: Gilbert and George pay China's price - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are many ordinary people here, people off the street. The China Art
Gallery is always the place where you see whether the political trend is
going backwards or forwards, the young Chinese said.
We were talking in front of 'City Drop,' one of 55 recent pictures by
Gilbert and George on show there until 3 October. He liked 'City Drop' which
shows Gilbert and George tumbling from the sky above a panoramic view of
London.
So did Long Xizu, professor of the Central Institute of Minorities, and a
famous establishment critic of photography and art. His interpretation of
the picture was fascinating. He thought that 'City Drop' meant that no
matter how hard we try, even if we jump up into the sky, it is impossible to
escape what we have created. And sometimes, no matter how beautiful those
things are, everyone wants to escape.
As we were walking round, he told me of the conversations he could overhear.
A young man told an older one he thought the pictures 'wonderful.' 'What's
so wonderful?' asked the older man. 'There's no beauty there. Everyone is
standing up side down.'
The Chinese have had long and painful practice in looking for meaning in
paintings, or indeed any other works of art, and the meaning of the Gilbert
and George show both in itself and as an exhibition with government support
 -it was organised through the cultural section of the Chinese Embassy in
London in co-operation with the China International Exhibition Agency, a
department of the Ministry of Culture in Beijing - has been the talk of the
Beijing art world ever since the English artists arrived. The art community,
though small, is remarkably active, and spans the avant garde, professors in
art schools and representatives of the Ministry of Culture, the body that
still determines the fate of official art.
The official view seems to be that an exhibition of the works of 'Mr Gilbert
and Mr George,' the distinguished and famous western artists, is a fine
example of cultural exchange and friendship between our two countries. The
unofficial view, expressed by young Chinese who take a pride in aggressive
cynicism, is that 'they must have paid a lot of money to the China Art
Gallery'.
While each of these statements is true, neither is the whole truth, nor does
their combination add up to it. Four years after the Tiananmen Square
incident and in the final stages of its bid to secure the Olympics,
permitting such a major exhibition would have been irresistible to any
government in need of a boost to the 'liberal' aspect of its image.
The China Daily, the English language paper popped under all hotel guests'
doors, even implies as much in its listings entry for the show. As to the
money, these days, and indeed throughout the 1980s, the temporary exhibition
spaces of the China Art Gallery are available for rent. Some of the young
avant garde painters have hired small rooms for shows - not always without
incident. The week before the Gilbert and George show opened, an exhibition
by a group of young painters was closed after gallery officials demanded
that some of the more controversial works be moved to another venue. One
exhibitor staged a protest event, cutting his long hair; he was arrested and
the show closed down.
The Gilbert and George show occupies three rooms on the first floor, the
most prestigious. The exhibition was paid for with privately raised funds,
including support from the Anthony D'Offay Gallery and the Willis Corroon
Group.
At the opening, the gallery was packed to bursting with an extraordinary
mixture of art world types, both western and Chinese, dressed in everything
from vests and cotton trousers to impeccable business suits to the latest
clubbing gear who listened to speeches from the British ambassador and the
former Chinese vice-minister for culture before getting stuck into the
mini-riot that broke out around the catalogue desk. And all fuelled on
bottles of pop, drunk through a straw - no alcohol, probably fortunately,
was served.
And what did the artists think of it all? The opening they found 'very
emotional, historic'.
Gilbert and George wanted to show in China because 'there are people here,
like everybody else. Once we arrived we knew it was the right decision,
because we had this feeling of modernity, of hope. We think they will be
able to understand our art in a fresh way'.
While some of the younger Chinese viewers were disappointed that the
pictures had so little 'anger' in them (expressing their rage about past
deceits and future uncertainty is a very important theme for Beijing's young
painters) all were impressed at the scale of the works, their techniques and
vivid colours.
The last western artist to show in the gallery was Robert Rauschenberg in
1985, whose work had an enormous effect on the work of local painters,
leading directly to the present school of Political Pop now finding favour
in the west.
Whether there will be a school of Gilbert and George is too early to say.
Younger Chinese artists are much more sophisticated now, and firmly
committed to finding their own way of expressing their experiences, a view
with which Gilbert and George are in perfect sympathy. Standing in their
immaculate suits in a tiny shack, both home and studio of a young artist who
had just staged a performance in their honour, they told him, 'This is just
how we started out. We were the poorest people we knew.'
They are far from poor now, and successful internationally in a way few
British artists have ever been. That determined individualism and years of
hard work can bring the highest rewards is a lesson that the Chinese are
more than ready to hear, and one that the presence in their capital of
Gilbert and George, their timing as impeccable as their suits, is uniquely
able to embody.
Gilbert &amp; George China Exhibition, China National Art Gallery, Beijing, 3
September to 3 October, then to The Art Museum, Shanghai, 21 October to 11
November. Supported by the Willis Corroon Group.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: Moving British debut - Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGER Thomas Quasthoff, who made his British debut on Friday morning,
was one of the Edinburgh Festival's unknown quantities. In the event, his
recital of Schubert and Brahms lieder proved a real success.
A friend, who had arrived late at the Queen's Hall and had had to wait
outside the auditorium until a suitable pause, told me afterwards of his
immediate excitement in hearing Quasthoff's eloquence and unaffected
communicative ease through the closed doors, though he had known nothing of
Quasthoff beforehand.
This is an important test, because those who see Quasthoff before he starts
to sing may find their reactions coloured by the fact that he is a victim of
thalidomide. His publicity makes no mention of this, and he himself draws no
attention to it.
He enters with his accompanist, mounts some extra steps, and sings from his
perch on a stool. His face is calm, his manners simple and sweet, his accord
with Peter Langehein, his accompanist, one of affection and good humour.
Quasthoff's voice is described as a baritone, though to my ear it is more
like a very light bass. In recital it reveals no great volume or glamour,
and sometimes it starts to sound slightly reedy. But he is a communicator,
one who makes the words he sings speak.
The sheer lack of fuss or sentimentality in his way of singing 'An die
Musik' was refreshing - and touching, after the several dark Schubert songs
he had already delivered. Then, after the interval, he sang the Brahms Four
Serious Songs. He gave them without the gravitas or portentousness that has
often marked their performance, but rather as a plain creed by which he
lived his life.
Like others, I was moved to tears by the Brahms. Lest I sound too
enthusiastic about Quasthoff, I state that his art is not one of limitless
resource. He phrases with a natural sense of legato but without an always
firm cantilena line. He shades his singing eloquently, but has a restricted
range of vocal character; there is not much contrast (though enough) between
the three or more 'roles' he plays in the course of Schubert's Szene aus
Faust and Erlkonig. Singing 'Infelice, e tu credevi' from Verdi's Ernani (as
a self-indulgent first encore), he did not attempt the advanced years of the
character who sings it; heartfelt, but youthful and small-scaled.
Yet Quasthoff is so sincere a singer that he never seems held back by such
limitations. The personality that he projects is one of dignity and
reflectiveness. He seems naturally suited to music of a personal, Romantic
tendency; but he handled some of Schubert's longer narratives with
assurance. May he return to these shores, and soon.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENICE, as we are reminded by the sumptuous Gentile Bellini paintings in the
Accademia, has long been a city of ceremony. Even today on great occasions
such as the Regatta, the feast of the Redeemer, and Carnival, the crowds,
the fireworks, the trappings, and the masks are a sometimes degenerate
reminder of the grandeur of the Republic in its festive heyday.
The Save Venice organisation, which has achieved splendid results in the
restorations it has sponsored, has brought imagination even to its
fund-raising and it has turned its attention also to investigating Venetian
music and its performance in the past.
The American-born musicologist Randolph Mickelson, long a Venice resident,
has for some years been studying not only the manuscripts of Venetian music
of the golden age but also the records of performances in the Basilica of
San Marco, collating published sources with ancient ledgers to reconstruct
with accuracy the music of a specific Mass celebrated on a given day. For,
to confound later scholars, the musical parts of the Mass, often composed by
several hands, might be given in varying sequences on different occasions.
Over a six-year period, Mickelson has convincingly recreated a Mass heard in
San Marco on Tuesday 6 May 1597 on the occasion of the crowning of the
Dogaressa Morosina Morosini Grimani, the climax of a three-day celebration
involving processions, a grand ball, an elaborate supper for hundreds of
guests, a mock sea-battle, and the solemn presentation of a golden rose, a
papal gift brought to Venice by the pontiff's Nuncio. This delivery took
place at the end of the solemn Mass, which included music by a dead
composer, Adrian Willaert, and by the living Venetians Giovanni Gabrieli and
Giovanni Croce. Both composed regularly for the Basilica - Gabrieli was San
Marco's organist for many years, and Croce later became its choirmaster '
but their fame, and their music, rapidly traveled from Venice to other parts
of Europe.
Mickelson found a manuscript of Croce's Ordinary, used in the Dogaressa's
Mass, in the Great Choirbook of the Imperial Chapel of Vienna. For the
invited audience of the generous patrons of Save Venice, in a Basilica all
aglow (the Zen chapel newly resplendent thanks to these friends of the city)
like a magic series of golden caves, the Dogaressa's Mass was sung last week
for the first time in almost four centuries.
Like the mosaics through which it echoed, it has maintained all its
brilliance. First a brass choir proceeded from the main door of the church
down the nave, through the roodscreen, to the altar, its solemn fanfare
reechoing in the shadowy air. Then, invisible in the west loft, the
Ambrosian singers and members of the National Philharmonic Orchestra
performed three psalms of Croce, while the baritone Francis Keeping -
standing in for the Nuncio - chanted the words of the Mass, as the Coro
Gregoriano of Treviso - Italy's finest keepers of the Gregorian flame -
responded.
Keeping stood in the great porphyry pulpit, the Gregorians clustered below
him, so chant and baroque music alternated from separate parts of the
church, as chorus alternated with solo instruments, and the organ, sometimes
a powerful accompaniment, sometimes magnificently on its own, poured out
floods of glorious sound.
The separation of the forces seemed deliberately to counterpose church and
state, the stark chanting belonged to heaven while the Doge's assertive
trumpets, heard at intervals from behind the altar, were compelling
reminders of worldly power.
The gifted young conductor Raffaello Sapere ably kept the separate forces
together and - with the mellifluent and sober Keeping - helped maintain the
shape of the event. Most of the gala international audience sat in the nave,
under the flickering reddish lights of the chandeliers. But a fortunate few
were allowed in the little area before the altar, where the thrones of Doge
and Dogaressa once stood. Here the acoustics were amazingly clear, the dying
echoes never overlapped or became muddied; and the secular brass rang out
with a clarity and brilliance that would have fallen sweetly then on ducal
ears, as it did, now, on ours.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Arts: Henze, Handel, Beethoven - Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON SUNDAY we had a brace of BBC Proms: at noon, Hans Werner Henze's newly
completed Requiem, (followed by a public party in the park), and in the
evening the 'period' Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment playing Haydn's
and Beethoven's last symphonies. The special attractions of each had nothing
to do with the other.
Henze's Requiem has grown from a 1990 'Introitus' - written upon the death,
from an Aids-related illness, of the London Sinfonietta's artistic director
Michael Vyner - to a nine-movement work, one of his best. None of the
ancient liturgical text is actually sung, though its words apparently guided
the composing; Henze is not a believer, and has chosen to treat eight
sections of the Requiem as symbolic of related deep feeling - grief, fear,
loss and so on. He has borrowed a non-canonical ninth, the 'Ave verum
corpus', surely with Mozart's ethereally tender setting in mind.
Instead of voices, then, Henze has assigned eloquent solo roles to piano and
virtuoso trumpet, fronting a large chamber orchestra with many chiming
instruments, (celesta, vibraphone, tubular bells, handbells). The little
Geistliche Konzerte of Heinrich Schutz served him as models. Throughout, the
tone is intimate, lyrical, luminous, candidly personal: impossible not to
think of John Corigliano's recent, strident 'Aids' Symphony as a comparison,
and impossible not to think of this Requiem as incomparably finer music.
Just occasionally, the score raises its voice in anger or distress,
fulfilling the dramatic demands of an hour-long piece: in the urgent 'Dies
irae', of course, in the violent 'Rex tremendae' which introduces the
trumpet for the first time, in a 'Tuba mirum' with a grotesque parodistic
march and Latin-American rhythms. But as in all Henze's best chamber music,
ruminative gentleness is the keynote; Paul Crossley - Vyner's successor with
the Sinfonietta - struck it unerringly in the lovely piano-music, and Hakan
Hardenberger too in the speaking trumpet-part (high- flying though it is).
With the 'Sanctus' at the close, shimmering with handbells and dramatised by
a pair of trumpets high up in the balconies, the score attains an elevated
composure. Oliver Knussen conducted with full sympathetic authority. Henze's
particular genius, which sometimes sounds thin-stretched in large-scale
pieces, has never been better served than by the original form and style of
this Requiem.
The evening Prom concert was given by Frans Bruggen and the Orchestra of the
Age of Enlightenment ('period' instruments). A nice pairing: the last
symphonies of Haydn, the 'London', and Beethoven, the 'Choral'. In the
Albert Hall, with these instrumental forces, the Haydn sounded elegant but a
little wan: one wanted to hear it somewhere smaller, or at least to be
standing at the front of the Promenade.
Somehow, nonetheless, Bruggen worked miracles with the 'Choral' Symphony.
His tempi were consistently quick, by ordinary standards, and perfectly
convincing. The dry, rattly timpani made a splendid effect in the Scherzo.
The New Company chorus had a confidence and clarity disproportionate to
their modest numbers, and the soloists - Judith Howarth, Susan Bickley, Hans
Peter Blochwitz and Andreas Schmidt - were as clean and well-matched a
quartet as I have heard in this work for a long time. The audience was
overjoyed, quite rightly.

FT  07 SEP 93 / People: From public and private sectors to Avon's lobbying
forum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Western Development Partnership in Avon, a public and private sector
lobbying forum, has appointed its first chief executive, Richard Brown.
Until May this year he was manager of strategic direction and organisation
at the power distribution company National Grid.
The partnership was formed as a company in June to press the case for Avon's
economic development. It arose out of a widely-felt belief that the region
has suffered from the lack of a unified voice, especially in pressing its
case in Whitehall and Brussels. The impact of the recession on the area has
been compounded by the contraction of the defence and aerospace industries.
Chris Garcia, a strategic planning consultant, has been drawing up a
business plan for the partnership, which has funding of Pounds 250,000 for
its first year from councils, industry and Avon Tec. Brown's task will be to
promote the region and attract inward investment and job creation. The
partnership has already been active in co-ordinating bids for European
Community regional aid.
Brown's background is in both the public and private sectors. An Oxford
graduate now aged 46, his early career was as a civil servant, firstly with
the Department of the Environment and then the Department of Trade and
Industry. For three years he was head of the North American section of the
DTI's Invest in Britain Bureau.
In 1988 he joined Meyer International, the timber supplier, where he was
head of corporate development and joint managing director of its German
subsidiary, Kloeckner-Meyer.
He joined National Grid in February last year.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Jury is out over a mass of minutiae -
Calls to reform the over-complicated and over-stretched industrial tribunal
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What did 140,000 UK policemen do recently when they spotted a potential
pensions loophole in an opinion from the Advocate General of the European
Court of Justice?
The answer is they turned to the UK industrial tribunals - each and every
one of them filed a separate sex discrimination claim. Firemen, air traffic
controllers and some bank workers piled in, too, with the result that the
already over-stretched tribunals acquired the equivalent of more than two
years' work almost overnight.
The policemen are watching the Coloroll group of cases on which judgment in
the ECJ is expected soon. The cases follow an earlier judgment on sex
equality in occupational pensions and the court is being asked to decide
whether employers may pay higher lump sum pensions to women because they
live longer than men. The advocate general has suggested that men with
complaints in train when the judgment is delivered could qualify for extra
benefits - hence, on Police Federation advice, the flurry of complaints to
tribunals.
These recent mass claims, springing from machinations in Luxembourg, provide
an extreme example of how far industrial tribunals have departed from their
original function.
When the first tribunals were set up 30 years ago in the UK, they had a
simple job: to hear employers' complaints about the training levy then in
operation.
Since then, a stream of changes to the law has widened the jurisdiction of
tribunals, making them virtually local labour courts dealing with most
employment matters. This domestic jurisdiction has been overlaid recently by
rulings from Brussels and Luxembourg.
As the scope of industrial tribunals has widened, criticism of them has
mounted. Allegations by users - employers as well as employees - of delays
in cases being heard and excessive legalism are prompting demands for an
overhaul of the system.
Mr David Cockburn, a partner with Pattinson &amp; Brewer, a law firm which often
acts for trade unions, has experience of how complex proceedings may now be.
He represented a group of sacked Tilbury dockers in the longest-ever
tribunal case. After 205 days of hearings between 1989 and 1992, 447 pages
of written decision, and a further 13 days in the Employment Appeal
Tribunal, the case is awaiting a Court of Appeal decision. Costs so far
total about Pounds 3m.
The dockers' case presents a very different picture from the 'simple
palm-tree justice' tribunals were expected to dispense, says Mr Cockburn.
'Tribunals were even staffed in the beginning by old colonial judges. The
intention was they would be speedy, informal and cheap, determining
reasonableness in accordance with common sense criteria, rather than the
interpretation of legislation or precedent.'
But, according to critics, those early aims, set out in 1968, are not being
met. Mr Peter Martin, head of legal affairs at the Engineering Employers'
Federation says that most employers consider tribunals to be a 'good thing
but they're disappointed in the way they're operating now'.
The Confederation of British Industry echoes this view.
With the relative decline of trade union power and the break-up of national
bargaining between employers and unions, the entire industrial relations
setting has changed so much that there should be a rethink, says Mr
Cockburn.
'Tribunals grew up at a time when the law largely kept out of industrial
relations and grievances were dealt with around the bargaining table. Now
many employees look to the law as the way of solving employment-related
problems,' he says.
The most common complaint against tribunals is that there are excessive
delays in cases being heard. In England and Wales, half of cases have to
wait over six months before being dealt with; Scotland appears to be more
efficient, with only 20 per cent of cases having to wait that long.
Critics claim backlogs reached ridiculous proportions after tribunals ran
out of money in mid-1990. The use of part-time chairmen for hearings was
suspended to make savings, resulting in a temporary 40 per cent fall in the
number of hearings.
Since then, tribunals in England and Wales have had a new president, Judge
Timothy Lawrence, who says the problem of delays is being tackled by
increased funding and the recruitment of more chairmen. But he points to
difficulties caused by an 'enormous and unprecedented increase in work' for
the tribunals in recent years.
In 1990-91, there were about 43,000 applications registered with tribunals
in the UK; the next year this leapt to almost 67,500; for 1992-93 the figure
stands at just under 72,000. It remains to be seen what the policemens'
claims will do for this year's total.
Judge Lawrence blames the recession for much of the increase in tribunal
cases. Two-thirds of applications recently have concerned allegations of
unfair dismissal.
He also believes people have become more aware of their rights and that an
increasing number of white-collar workers on higher salaries have been
bringing complaints - and their legal representatives - to tribunals.
Delays are not a problem only for applicants, according to the CBI and EEF.
Mr Michael O'Connor, head of employment law at the CBI, says managers
dislike having cases hanging over them.
Apart from long delays, the next most frequent criticism of tribunals is
that they have become legalistic to an absurd degree - the Tilbury dockers'
case is an extreme example. The original concept was that applicants should
be able to conduct their own cases.
Judge Lawrence accepts that 'inevitably and sadly' legalism has increased
and attributes this mainly to 'outside influences' such as the higher
courts, parliament and the EC.
The Equal Opportunities Commission describes current equal pay laws, which
are among the most difficult for tribunals to interpret, as 'grotesquely
complex'. Mr Alan Lakin, senior legal adviser, has described the laws as
'paradise for lawyers but hell for women'.
It is small wonder, says Mr Cockburn, that when applicants are faced with
such complexities they feel the need for legal representation. While most
applicants still survive without lawyers, 'there is no doubt the difficult
cases are getting more difficult', adds Mr Cockburn.
Long delays and increasing legalism can also be attributed to the almost
haphazard growth in tribunals' jurisdiction. The latest piece of labour
legislation, the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, increases the
tribunals' workload still further. It extends employment protection measures
and makes tribunals responsible for sorting out some grievances against
trade unions.
Says Mr Martin: 'Tribunals have grown up piecemeal. I don't think anybody
has stood back and looked at the whole system until recently, when things
have started to get bogged down. The whole thing has grown up in a very
English, pragmatic way.'
The Engineering Employers' Federation is now calling for the government to
review the entire workings of tribunals. There would be no shortage of
suggestions to such a review from lawyers, pressure groups and academics. Mr
Martin, for example, would like to see binding settlements more easily
reached, without the need to go to a tribunal in the first place. He would
also advocate a move to replace the 'forest of case law' with updated codes
of practice on issues such as dismissal on the grounds of ill-health.
A move away from the adversarial and towards a more inquisitorial approach,
with a greater use of written statements, is also frequently mentioned by
would-be reformers as a way of getting more quickly to the heart of
disputes.
The latest suggestion for reform has come from Roy Lewis and Jon Clark,
respectively professors of law and industrial relations at the University of
Southampton. In a pamphlet published by the Institute of Employment Rights,
which is being launched this week at the TUC congress in Brighton, they
argue that arbitration could provide a voluntary alternative to the tribunal
route*.
In the first detailed exposition of how such a scheme might work, they say
that 'alternative dispute resolution' has become a fashionable topic in
areas as diverse as matrimonial and commercial disputes. In employment
matters, they argue, the opposite seems to be happening.
The two, who are themselves on the panel of arbitrators for the Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service, see arbitration as potentially a
fairer, cheaper and more accessible method of parties settling their
differences. The increased use of arbitration would also help to alleviate
the current overloading in the tribunals, they argue.
The most radical suggestion of all would be to abolish tribunals completely,
on the grounds that they have outlived their usefulness, have become
terminally bogged-down in legalism and overlap confusingly with other
courts.
Numerous though critics of tribunals are, the suggestion of complete
abolition is usually met with horror. The consensus is that virtually every
flaw in the tribunals is magnified in other jurisdictions.
As one Acas official put it, adapting Winston Churchill's verdict on
democracy: 'It's the worst system apart from all the others.' The way
forward is clearly reform.

Tom Frost has lost no time in snapping up his first non-executive
directorships since retiring as deputy chairman of National Westminster
Bank. Last week he joined ICCH and The London Clearing House, the clearing
house for Liffe, IPE, LCE and LME. Now he has joined the board of Five Oaks
Investments, a property company.
Five Oaks says it had decided to appoint a third non-executive director to
comply with the Cadbury report. It plans to embark on a period of expansion
to take advantage of the upturn in the property cycle. Last month, Five Oaks
Investments raised Pounds 12.2m in a placing and open offer, which has given
it the scope to spend Pounds 15m on acquisitions.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Allen &amp; Overy 'most profitable in UK'
 -A survey of last year's profits at the top 100 firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's top 100 law firms billed Pounds 2.7bn in fees in the 1992-93
financial year and achieved average profits per partner of Pounds 176,000,
according to an annual survey of law firm earnings by Legal Business
magazine, published tomorrow.
Allen &amp; Overy, the City solicitors, emerged as the most profitable UK firm,
with profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 on a turnover of Pounds 117m. It
jumped ahead of Slaughter and May and Linklaters &amp; Paines, which finished
first and second in 1991-92 with profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 and
Pounds 349,000 respectively.
In 1992-93 Slaughter ach-ieved profits per partner of Pounds 333,000 on a
slightly reduced turnover (down from Pounds 113m to Pounds 112m), and
Linklaters had profits per partner of Pounds 322,000 on an increased
turnover of Pounds 154m (up from Pounds 144m).
Overall, the 100 law firms covered by the survey earned combined profits of
Pounds 690m. Although these are impressive figures for a period of
recession, the magazine says there are clear signs from the generally lower
levels of gross fees that the business of law is no longer a growth
industry, but one where firms are fighting for shares of a decreasing pie.
Ms Karen Dillon, editor of Legal Business, says that 1992-93 was a tough
year for law firms, and this year she expects to see mergers,
asset-stripping, and partners moving in record numbers.
One notable feature of the last year is that 'the typical law firm partner
is starting to earn the same kind of money as (rather than more than)
his/her clients. That's good news for clients,' she says.
Another feature of 1992-93 was the rise of regional law firms. Dibb Lupton
Broomhead, the Leeds-based solicitors, is ranked 17th in the UK by turnover,
with gross fees of Pounds 36.7m and profits per partner of Pounds 200,000.
Five regional law firms, Dibb Lupton, Eversheds Phillips &amp; Buck (Cardiff),
Pinsent &amp; Co (Birmingham), Simpson Curtis (Leeds) and Hammond Suddards
(Leeds) had profits per partner in excess of Pounds 150,000, and 19 had
profits per partner of more than Pounds 100,000.
A league table of gross fees also confirms the widening gap between the top
six firms and the rest. Clifford Chance is ranked top with a turnover of
Pounds 210m followed by Linklaters with Pounds 154m, Freshfields Pounds
124m, Allen &amp; Overy Pounds 117m, Lovell White Durrant Pounds 115m and
Slaughter Pounds 112m. But there is then a large gap to seventh-placed
Herbert Smith, which has a turnover of Pounds 77.8m.
The magazine comments that last year's financial results indicate that
medium-sized firms suffered the most. It is among these firms that the mass
defections of lawyers, asset-stripping and mergers will take place, it says.
If they do not, they will be facing what Alan Hodgart of Hodgart Temporal,
the management consultancy, calls the 'gentle decline' into oblivion, it
concludes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Radcliffe yesterday joined the board of Hogg Robinson, the business
travel, financial services and transport group. Radcliffe, 40, has worked
his way up through the group; he joined in 1978 and now also becomes
managing director of Hogg Robinson Business International.
Radcliffe, who was born in Hackney, east London, began his travel management
career with the Automobile Association at the age of 23; his first job was
to set up an AA travel agency in Norwich.
Brian Perry, the chairman, says Radcliffe's appointment underlines the
importance the group attaches to business travel; having sold its retail
travel chain to Airtours last June, Radcliffe says he is looking for
possible acquisition targets both inside and outside the UK.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Technology: A kick-start for multimedia - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE is talking about multimedia. Rapid growth has been predicted for
this combination of text, sound and pictures. A number of the factors
necessary to make this growth happen are finally falling into place.
In the personal computer world, many manufacturers are now building their
hardware with CD-Rom drives built in (CD-Rom being the main delivery system
for multimedia products). Also, the drives have tumbled in price and CDs are
cheap to produce.
However, if we are to see a real explosion in the market, with the
multimedia CD realising its potential and becoming common in homes and
businesses, a big obstacle needs to be overcome - the cost of creation.
Up to now, principally text-based CD-Rom products have been developed and
marketed by publishing houses whose principal copyright asset is text. The
moment a book publisher strays from its traditional copyright base and
enters the world of multimedia, creative costs can be crippling. Yet
multimedia is exactly the area publishers need to be in to service the
information market of the next century.
The importance of reducing the cost of materials in a multimedia CD-Rom
product is considerable. Imagine all the elements which go to make up a
20-volume encyclopedia - then at least double this to take account of the
fact that multimedia also uses sound, animation and film.
To give an idea of scale, some interactive CD products contain thousands of
colour photographs and text documents. If these are sourced at the rates
charged by photographic agencies for book products, the cost of the images
alone would be more than Pounds 250,000. A few more overheads of that
magnitude, and the whole business becomes impossible.
Consequently, some hardware and software manufacturers have poured huge
subsidies into multimedia titles in a bid to ease the transition to
commercial reality. However, with the spectrum of multimedia resources in
the hands of so many disparate copyright holders, publishers and software
developers do not see such a simplistic approach working.
There is another related problem: the 'price-perception' of a CD as opposed
to that of a book. The public's idea of what a CD should cost is influenced
by the lower price of music CDs. People are willing to pay hundreds of
pounds for a set of printed volumes, but it is difficult to sell a CD to the
home market above, say, Pounds 200, however much information has been
squeezed on to it.
This is a depressing realisation for the multimedia author, especially when
you consider how much can be fitted on the disc (the complete works of
Shakespeare take up only 5 per cent of a CD's storage capacity).
Should budding multimedia authors simply throw up their hands in despair?
Not at all.
Since publishers have a huge advantage in owning copyright on text and other
book-related materials, many may think they can corner the market by
jealously guarding their perceived advantage. They would be deluding
themselves. Multimedia is a co-operative affair.
The computing industry thrives on the enthusiasm and drive of small
developers and authors. It is in the interests of publishers to share their
copyright materials with resource holders in other industries, whether
music, film or animation. This would make available, at reasonable cost, the
single most expensive creative overhead.
The best way of imagining how such a development would work is in terms of a
resource centre. Authors or authoring organisations would become
subscribers, their fee purchasing a particular level of usage, including
republication of materials selected. The idea is to kick-start the
development of the multimedia industry. It provides obvious cost advantages
to authors which, in a competitive market, will inevitably be passed on to
the purchaser.
The author is chief executive of Andromeda Interactive based in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Technology: A renaissance in treatment - New drugs to treat
schizophrenia are finally becoming available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, tales of a miraculous new drug on the market to treat
schizophrenia began to make their way around hospitals and psychiatrists'
offices in Europe and the US. The stories told of patients debilitated by
mental illness, sinking desperately into hallucinations and paranoia, then
suddenly rehabilitated and living a normal life.
The success of the drug, clozapine, which was launched by Sandoz of
Switzerland in the US in 1989, awakened a long-dormant interest in
developing treatments for schizophrenia.
Encouraged by the clozapine experience, pharmaceutical groups are now
producing a new generation of drugs to alleviate schizophrenia.
Among the most promising are risperidone and bromoperidol, both manufactured
by Janssen, a Belgian subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and remoxipride, made
by Astra in Sweden. The UK pharmaceutical group Zeneca is expected to launch
a competing treatment by late 1995 and Merck of the US and Kabi of Sweden
are also developing candidates.
Schizophrenia, a serious mental illness involving hallucinations and
paranoia, and in rare cases 'split personality' syndrome, is a relatively
common disease, affecting about 1 per cent of the population. It usually
appears in late adolescence, when the frontal lobes of the brain are
developing rapidly, and its impact is devastating. If untreated, the
afflicted lose touch with reality and often drift into extreme poverty.
Nearly one-third of the homeless population in the US is thought to suffer
from the disease.
The drug market for schizophrenia is already substantial, with total annual
sales amounting to about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), according to Ian Smith,
a pharmaceuticals analyst with Lehman Brothers International in London.
It is also one of the faster-growing areas in the industry, with sales
expanding at a rate of about 9 per cent a year. Moreover, with the large
number of new drugs for schizophrenia coming on to the market, these numbers
could balloon.
'We are finally starting to see a wide range of drugs developed for
schizophrenia,' says Peter Tooley, head of medical affairs for Janssen in
the UK. 'After 30 to 40 years of studying the disease, we're starting to get
a handle on the disease.'
Schizophrenia, which has long been a mystery to scientists, is now known to
involve errant chemical messages making their way through the brain.
'Dopamine receptors' are thought to play an important role in this mental
game of telephone, and almost all schizophrenic drugs on the market -
referred to as neuroleptics - inhibit different classifications of these
receptors.
Prior to the current generation of neuroleptics, the development of
schizophrenic treatments depended more on luck than science. The first drug
used in treating schizophrenia, thorozine, was discovered by accident.
A doctor in Vietnam noticed that the compound, used at that point as a
sedative, was effective in ridding patients of hallucinations. Psychiatrists
began to use the product to treat schizophrenia and similar drugs were soon
widely available.
Support for neuroleptics as the primary treatment for schizophrenia has been
growing ever since, and is now embraced by the majority of psychiatrists.
Despite the growing faith in drugs to alleviate mental disease, the market
for schizophrenia drugs is just emerging from a dry spell which spanned
nearly 30 years.
'After the first drug came out, all we saw were variations on that
treatment,' says John Kane, chairman of psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish
Medical Centre, New York. 'That's why it's so exciting now to see a
renaissance in drugs for the disease.'
Doctors are particularly anxious for alternatives because past treatments
have been far from perfect.
Drugs introduced prior to clozapine were extremely effective in controlling
the hallucinations and paranoia, but they left patients depressed, apathetic
and socially inept.
They had no effect at all on large numbers of schizophrenic patients and
provoked disturbing side-effects: a clumsy gait, compulsive foot tapping and
an irreversible neurological syndrome, 'tardive dyskinesia', characterised
by twitching of the facial muscles and tongue.
When it hit the market, clozapine was unique in that it did not cause muscle
spasms. It was also effective for many patients who had failed to respond to
traditional treatments. 'For many of my patients, clozapine has seemed like
a miracle,' says Robert McDivitt, trustee of the American Psychiatric
Association.
Clozapine has its own problems, though. Its effectiveness in treating
schizophrenia had been documented 20 years before its 1989 launch, but was
withdrawn from the market due to a risky, though rare side-effect:
agranulocytosis, a white blood cell deficiency.
Agranulocytosis can often prove fatal. However, the drug was finally
approved for market because so few patients taking the drug - around 1 per
cent - develop the affliction, and because the risk of the disease can be
greatly reduced through regular blood tests. The drug's approval also
reflected the desperate circumstances of many schizophrenic patients.
Clozapine has not been completely effective in improving patients' social
skills.
'Clozapine is a dirty drug, by which I mean that it affects a number of
different dopamine receptors,' says Peter Jager, international product
manager for the drug. 'The new generation of drugs will be addressing
specific receptors, and will therefore be much cleaner.'
Neuroleptics such as risperidone have generated a great deal of interest
because they seem to deal with the sociability of the patient as well as the
more serious problem of hallucinations. The drug can cause muscle spasms,
although the problem is much less severe than with traditional treatments.
The medical community is waiting anxiously to acquire the new drugs, several
of which have been approved in Europe but not in the US.
'I have one patient who is just hanging on until she can get risperidone,'
says Jerome Rogoff, a professor at Harvard Medical School and assistant
chief of psychiatry at the Faulkner Hospital in Boston. 'It may make a
difference.'
Despite progress in research on schizophrenia, a great deal of mystery still
shrouds the disease. 'No one knows, for instance, why the drugs have an
impact on the receptor cells within hours, but no effect on the patient for
weeks,' says Donald Klein, a professor of psychology at Columbia University.
'It may be that the receptors are just the first domino in the chain, and
once the other dominoes are understood, that would pave the way for new
drugs.'
It is also unclear why neuroleptics now on the market are effective in
treating some patients and not others. Some scientists believe it is a
question of narrowing the search down to a single, specific receptor. Others
believe schizophrenia is not a single disease, but a group of diseases,
which require distinct drug treatments.
Even if researchers come up with a perfect drug, doctors say it will not
eradicate the disease. Patients usually suffer a relapse if they stop taking
medication. 'Patients with no mental illness will stop taking their pills
once they feel well,' said Rogoff.
'With schizophrenic patients this is an even greater risk. I have some
patients who refuse even to try certain drugs because they say a voice has
told them it's poisonous.'
Still, the wider choice of drugs on the market will be a boon, not only to
schizophrenic sufferers, but to researchers as well. 'With the new
treatments, we will be able to monitor the side-effects, and improvements in
patients' condition, and get a better understanding of the role of the
dopamine receptors,' says Jager. 'The key has not yet been found, but we are
coming closer every year.'

FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Challenging the agency
culture - Enterprise agencies are grappling with developments in the
business support sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Irwin and his team helped 136 people start up in business last year.
They helped an even larger number decide they were perhaps not suited to
going it alone.
Irwin's offices are in an area of Newcastle upon Tyne reminiscent of the
region's industrial past. But Project North East, the enterprise agency he
heads, is aiming for an even brighter future for the region and has already
made a considerable contribution.
Project North East runs counselling and training sessions for would-be
entrepreneurs as well as helping the owners of established businesses
improve their management skills. It helps growing businesses raise finance
and runs schemes to boost their exports.
The organisation is just one of more than 300 enterprise agencies throughout
the UK.
The agencies, which started in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1978 - though
London also claims a founding role - became important contributors to the
rebirth of Britain's enterprise culture in the 1980s. They were set up as a
private-sector initiative working alongside public-sector organisations, to
revitalise local business communities.
Last year more than 6,000 companies contributed about Pounds 17m in cash and
kind, often by seconding staff, to the agencies' finances.
Their initial focus was on helping people who wanted to start up their own
business, though many have since diversified into a broader range of
business support.
Present high levels of unemployment have, however, emphasised their
relevance to particular services such as job creation. 'Creating jobs and
growth is right back on the agenda,' says Brian Wright, chief executive of
the London Enterprise Agency.
The agencies have remained a remarkably stable element in the small business
support network, in spite of many changes in this area. They have not been
untouched by the new developments, the most challenging so far being the
creation of a nationwide network of one-stop business advice shops, now
renamed 'business links'.
The one-stop shops are a government initiative to bring together local
providers of business support - chambers of commerce, local authority
economic development units, Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and the
agencies - to provide more effective services.
The creation of the business link network is just one of a number of
challenges to the agencies' existing form. Other developments are: A
decision by Business in the Community (BitC), which co-ordinates community
programmes for its corporate members, to give up its role of umbrella
organisation for the agencies.
The growing role of the Training and Enterprise Councils in channelling
government funds into enterprise development. A revitalised chamber of
commerce movement, which is attempting to bring the level of service it
provides up to the level of its publicly financed continental counterparts.
BitC's decision to end its special relationship with the enterprise agencies
came at a time when they were grappling with the effects of some of the
other changes in the small business support sector. BitC had acted as a
lobbyist for the agencies and encouraged them to increase their
professionalism.
Its departure from this role has been followed by several months of rivalry
as agencies in the east Midlands attempted to forge a national organisation
called the Association of Local Enterprise Agencies. But the association
failed to win sufficient backing and a national network is now being formed
under the National Federation of Enterprise Agencies banner.
John Guest, a senior executive for Cadbury Schweppes, has been seconded to
the federation as chief executive. He says the strength of the organisation
is that it will be 'owned' by the agencies in a way that BitC never was.
The federation will provide a national voice for the agencies and give
encouragement in areas such as quality management.
Guest envisages the federation's ambit going beyond that of simply acting as
a trade association for the agencies. He says it should also set out to
influence those government policies directed at helping small firms.
With the national organisation now in place the agencies should be well
placed to address the more fundamental challenges to their role. These
centre on their relationships with the Tecs, the one-stop shops and the
pattern of corporate funding.
Some in the business support field fear that the creation of a one-stop shop
network threatens their individual identity and therefore attractiveness to
corporate sponsors. Wright says that in many parts of Britain the perception
of the agencies as a partnership between the private and public sectors has
already been eroded.
Public-sector finance channelled through the Tecs has come to play a growing
role in the agencies' financing. At the same time large companies face
increasing demands on their resources to fund community projects.
Guest recognises the potential problem of 'sponsor fatigue' but believes it
can be overcome through improved marketing by the agencies to their
private-sector backers.
The Tecs, Guest says, account for 50 per cent of the agencies' budgets, most
of it in the form of payments for training and counselling contracts.
Corporate sponsors account for just 20 per cent, but they still provide half
of the agencies' 'core funding' to meet overheads and administrative costs.
Irwin reckons Project North East received about 13 per cent of its 1993
revenues of Pounds 1.2m from corporate backers, 26 per cent from the UK
public sector, 12 per cent from European funds and 49 per cent from fees and
other earned income. 'You must handle your sponsors correctly but provided
they still get recognition for what they do there should be no reason for
them to stop funding you,' he says.
Irwin says, however, that it is important for the government to continue to
pump money into the small-business sector through programmes such as the
Enterprise Initiative, which subsidises consultancy help.
Project North East and the other agencies charge their established company
clients for services where possible but are still committed to providing a
free service to the start-up business.
Many involved in enterprise agencies see the maintainance of their
individual identity as central to their ability to continue to raise
private-sector finance. In theory they have a strong hand. The agencies have
unrivalled experience in helping start-ups and advising small established
businesses.
The chambers of commerce role, in contrast, has always veered more towards
providing information and assistance in fields such as exports. And while
many Tecs have expanded into providing training and advice they are, in
comparison to agencies, only recent arrivals.
'Our unique contribution is our experience operating a business advice
service for six years,' comments Bryce Staniland, finance director at
DonBAC, the Doncaster enterprise agency, shortly to join the local one-stop
shop.
Despite the agencies' tradition of providing hands-on help to small firms
the picture is inevitably becoming blurred as some become absorbed in the
local Tec or merge with chambers. There is already evidence that agency
numbers will decrease over the next few years, leaving only those that have
a broad financial and operating base.
Irwin estimates that 50 agencies at most will be strong enough to survive.
Guest says the agencies' federation represents 100 of the 250 agencies in
England and the regional associations are signing up new members all the
time. He hopes that the regional associations will form networks so that the
larger agencies support the smaller ones.
But he acknowledges the agency movement will not be served by maintaining
weak agencies that cannot offer a good level of service.
David Grayson, managing director of BitC's business strategy group, contends
that the one-stop shops are the natural successors of the agency movement of
the 1980s. The agencies face considerable change but should not feel
threatened, he says.
Agency directors and the small business community will be hoping that he is
right. At the same time many in the community must be concerned that one of
the most successful sectors of small business support faces such an
upheaval.

is right - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New proposals for reducing the problem of late payments have been made in
the form of a draft interest on payments bill by the Forum of Private
Business.
The forum suggests that suppliers should have a statutory right to collect
overdue payments for up to six years from the date of invoice. That
statutory right would be conferred if the principal amount but no interest
had been paid or, when a customer could not pay, the interest alone could be
collected until he could.
The proposed legislation has been framed to allow the creditor to choose the
best time to collect the interest while minimising the risk of losing
business. Interest could be demanded when the supplier ceased to trade with
the customer, when it became less important to retain the customer or when
the supplier retired or went into liquidation.

popularity - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to the UK government's loan guarantee scheme have led to a sharp
increase in the number of loans granted and a strong demand for loans at the
highest permitted level of Pounds 250,000.
There was a near three-fold increase in the value of loans granted to Pounds
21.7m in July and August compared with the same period of 1992, while the
number of loans rose by 18 per cent to 430. Nine of the loans were for the
maximum amount of Pounds 250,000 (the new top rate for established
businesses) while a further 37 were for loans of between Pounds 100,000 (the
previous maximum) and Pounds 250,000.
Apart from increasing the amount that can be lent under the scheme from July
1, the guarantee cover for established businesses was raised from 70 to 85
per cent. The guarantee premiums were also cut.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taxing time for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value added tax regime introduced at the launch of the single European
market on January 1 is causing problems for German business. This is the
conclusion of a survey* by the German industry association, the
Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie.
The survey found that the tax regime has placed a considerable burden in
terms of cost and bureaucracy on German business. Its findings back up
complaints made by British companies and business organisations.
The new tax regime has imposed additional costs on business equivalent to
0.3 per cent of the value of intra-EC trade, the survey calculates. This has
resulted from the need to update computer programmes, train staff in the
complexities of the tax system, collate trade data and employ additional
administrative staff.
The single market VAT system has transferred responsibility for reporting
VAT liability and the collection of trade data from customs posts to
businesses. The EC still hopes to introduce a simplified system, taxing all
intra-EC shipments in the country of origin, in January 1997.
In the meantime, the transitional system has led to a marked complication of
trade activities, the German industry association says. Companies must
maintain three separate systems for dealing with VAT, for domestic sales,
for intra-EC sales, and for sales to customers outside the EC.
Businesses handling large volumes of deliveries frequently have difficulty
identifying invoices from suppliers within the EC on which no VAT has been
paid. Discrepancies between the data required for tax and for trade
statistics purposes impose an additional burden.
German businesses have also had problems confirming customers' VAT
registration numbers from the tax authorities. This puts them at a
disadvantage compared with their French counterparts, which can call up
numbers on the Minitel database.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Oil spending set for modest fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING BY the offshore oil industry in the UK sector of the North Sea is
expected to fall only modestly in during the next four years. This is in
spite of the fact that the UK continental shelf is now a mature area for oil
and gas production.
Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should
fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says
Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its
biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity.
The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which
suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development
and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the
UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn.
The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices,
follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when
214 wells were drilled.
Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish
Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997.
The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of
petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work.
About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the
northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997.
Forecasts of upstream petroleum activity and exploration - UK and worldwide.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Equal pensions for men and women
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOBBYING by the UK life and pension industries has persuaded the European
Court of Justice to delay by several months a key ruling on how employers
are to provide equal pensions for men and women.
The Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension
Funds were said to have argued that the advice given to the court on
equalising pensions would result in inequality in terms offered to those
with occupational pensions compared to those with private pensions.
A ruling in the Coloroll case, expected this month, will now be delayed
until December or January. In the case, involving the pension schemes of the
former home furnishings company now in liquidation, the court has been asked
to decide which elements of a pension have to be made equal for men and
women.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Demand for loans remains strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR consumer loans fell slightly in July, but remained at just below
its strongest level for two years.
Central Statistical Office credit figures show that consumers borrowed a net
Pounds 204m in July compared with Pounds 213m in June. The strength of
consumer borrowing supports evidence of rising consumer confidence even
though the figures do not include mortgages and account for only about 15
per cent of consumer debt.
Consumer lending started to revive 10 months ago, suggesting that people
have become more confident about the economic upturn and their personal
financial circumstances.
The latest figures show that increases in loans by building societies and
finance houses were offset by a fall in net lending on bank credit cards.
Consumers borrowed only Pounds 9m more than they paid back on credit cards
in July. This was down from net borrowings of Pounds 64m in June.
Credit-card borrowing has been hesitant since the start of the year
indicating lingering reluctance among consumers to run up big debts.
Net lending by finance houses - mainly hire purchase and loans by retailers
 -was Pounds 189m in July compared with Pounds 150m in the previous month.
Building societies lent a net Pounds 6m compared with a net repayment of
Pounds 1m in the previous month.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers also fell slightly in July to
Pounds 4.46bn. This was down from Pounds 4.69bn in June. The CSO said the
fall mainly reflected lower advances on credit cards.
But the underlying trend in overall lending remains upwards. In the three
months to July net lending rose to Pounds 535m from Pounds 444m in the
previous quarter.
A separate survey published yesterday by Infolink, the credit information
organisation, reported that consumer confidence was strengthening, with
upturns in July for loans to buy new cars, houses and shop goods.
Meanwhile, the Finance and Leasing Association said consumer confidence was
continuing to rise, with year-on-year gains in all sectors of consumer
credit except those associated with the housing market.
It said, however, that for the first time since the rush to beat the
re-imposition of stamp duty in autumn last year mortgage finance had
increased for two consecutive months.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Companies renew attack on quality standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH ROW has flared up between groups representing small businesses and
the British Standards Institution over the controversial management quality
standard BS5750.
The standard ensures that a company's management systems are effective so
that sales orders are handled efficiently, raw materials and tooling are in
the right place at the right time and any complaints are dealt with
speedily.
Small business organisations have complained that the standard is
bureaucratic, costly and more suited to large companies.
The simmering row between small-business groups such as the Federation of
Small Businesses and the Forum of Private Business appeared to have been
defused when the institution set up a joint committee in February to discuss
BS5750.
But it has flared again following a letter from Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI
chairman, to Mr Roger Dunn, the committee's chairman, saying that the
institution was not prepared to provide Pounds 150,000 to fund research into
the problems surrounding BS5750. The funding had not been formally
sanctioned, Mr Thomas wrote, and was the result of 'misunderstandings'.
Mr Thomas said the committee should cease its activities by the end of
November, although BSI might lend staff to help complete any initiatives
which had been started.
The issue is expected to come to a head at the next meeting of the committee
on Wednesday. A telephone conference of committee members involved in the
research project held last Friday considered withdrawing from the joint
committee and carrying out an independent review.
Mr Bernard Juby, representative on the committee of the Federation of Small
Businesses, said: 'The clear brief we were given was that this was to be an
ongoing review of all British standards and their impact on small business.
We want an independent review of the problems and then we can advise BSI
what to do - if anything. We are very anxious about the way things are
going.'
Mr Thomas said that BSI had supported programmes to increase awareness of
BS5750 and had published details of its prices to show that much of the cost
resulted from the fees of independent consultants advising companies.
He added: 'But I don't believe in setting up a talking shop which goes on
for ever and ever. If they don't come up with some robust suggestions by
November we could be there for another 12 months.'
BSI was not prepared to lower the requirements it set for BS5750 for small
firms because this would be a betrayal of the 22,000 companies which were
already registered, he added. BSI received between 15 and 20 letters of
support for BS5750 for every one complaint, he said.
BSI was also concerned that it had become the focus for criticism of BS5750
when there were 25 other companies with approval to certify companies to the
standard and monitor compliance. They should also be involved in funding any
research project, Mr Thomas said.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Global deal is sought on Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAXWELL Pension Trust, the government-appointed go-between for former
Maxwell company pension schemes and the City, has written to all parties
seeking a 'global settlement' involving up to Pounds 440m in disputed funds.
The trust, chaired by Sir John Cuckney, was set up in June 1992 and by the
end of last year had raised Pounds 6.2m in donations from organisations that
had conducted business with the late Robert Maxwell.
Since then there has been almost no progress in encouraging the return of
contested pension scheme assets from UK organisations and international
investment banks.
Representatives of the schemes said yesterday that if the latest initiative
failed to bring results they were prepared to serve writs against the
investment banks.
An adviser to one of the schemes said: 'This is a last push. If nothing
comes of it over the next two to three months, the writs will fly.'
The letter comes amid growing frustration among pension fund trustees and
administrators.
They had hoped that Sir John would have been able to persuade the banks to
negotiate the return of assets instead of forcing the pensions schemes to
start lengthy and expensive legal proceedings.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Housing market recovery picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOW recovery in the housing market is continuing, Department of the
Environment figures released yesterday indicate. They showed that work
started on 47,400 new dwellings in the three months from May to July.
The department said that builders started work on 9 per cent more homes than
in the corresponding three months last year. Completions were 40,300, down 4
per cent from the comparable figure for 1992.
It is estimated that in July 15,300 dwellings were started, compared with
14,200 in July last year.
Seasonally adjusted figures over the three months provide a clearer guide to
the state of the housing market.
These show that season-ally adjusted starts during May, June and July fell 6
per cent compared with the previous three months.
Housebuilders say that sales rose sharply in the early part of this year but
have slowed again in the traditionally quieter summer months, when many
potential customers go on holiday.
In the past few weeks the market has picked up again. Builders are hoping
that sales this month and next will be considerably higher than in the
corresponding months last year, when the housing market virtually died
following the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr David Wilson, chairman of housebuilder Wilson Bowden, said yesterday that
the housing market was recovering slowly.
He expected that many of the sales incentives offered by builders would
disappear in the next few months as the upturn continued.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Modest fall in offshore oil spending forecast
</HEADLINE>

SPENDING BY the offshore oil industry in the UK sector of the North Sea is
expected to fall only modestly in the next four years. This is in spite of
the UK continental shelf now being a mature area for oil and gas production.
Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should

About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the
northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997. But
many new fields will use lower-cost subsea technology rather than platforms,
while gas will make up an increasing proportion of the new fields coming
into production.
Oil output is expected to reach almost 2.5m barrels of oil a day in 1995,
compared with 2m a day this year. After 1995 output will fall back slightly.
About 20 per cent of future commercial fields in the North Sea have been
delayed by more than a year because of an abundance of new supplies and weak
oil prices, according to Arthur Andersen Petroleum Services.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Business advice shop to open late
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of the government's one-stop business advice centres will open
next month - about three months behind schedule.
One-stop shops in nine English regions - including Birmingham, Cheshire,
Tyneside and Leicestershire - are vying to be the first to open to companies
seeking advice on all aspects of how to run their affairs.
About 30 outlets are expected to open in the nine regions. The Department of
Trade and Industry, which is putting Pounds 5.5m into the scheme over the
next three years, plans a network of 200 shops throughout the country - to
be known as Business Links.
In a move that may be critical in determining how effectively the centres do
their job, Baroness Denton, the minister responsible for small businesses,
will soon start discussions with ministers in other departments to encourage
them to make their business services accessible through the centres.
Customers will be able to use the centres, which are recruiting core staff
at the moment, for advice on a range of issues from market intelligence and
exporting, to training and guidance on available finance.
Lady Denton expects the centres quickly to compile registers of freelance
specialists, such as translators and debt collectors, whom customers can
recruit on a short-term basis.
The units will normally be open from early morning until well into the
evening. Some services are to be free but others will be charged for.
The Department of Trade and Industry first announced its intention to create
the business centres in July 1992.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Sales fall foreseen by British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that its share of the
UK gas market would fall to 68.5 per cent by 1998 compared with a share of
91.8 per cent last year.
In a submission made last year and published in yesterday's MMC report, the
company indicated that it expected competitors to win a large part of its
market for industrial customers, particularly power stations. However, it
expected to retain 100 per cent of the regulated tariff market for small
customers, including households.
The forecast was based on an earlier agreement between the company and the
Office of Fair Trading whereby the company would cut its share of the
non-tariff market to 40 per cent by 1995. Since then the MMC has recommended
that more of the tariff market be thrown open to new competitors by 1997.
This forecast is one of the few in the MMC report that has survived the
censor's scissors. Much of the information supplied to the commission has
been erased from the report because of its commercially sensitive nature.
Several pages in the 1,000-page document are blank.
Other information supplied by the company includes a detailed calculation of
the costs of various proposals for restructuring the company. These ranged
from a net present cost of Pounds 330m to implement the arrangements already
agreed with the OFT, to Pounds 2.9bn for a complete break-up of British Gas
into separate operating companies and several regional distribution
companies.
In recommending the partial break-up of the company, the commission later
said it believed these estimates were unnecessarily high.
The report also includes details of submissions from other energy companies.
Many complain about alleged predatory and anti-competitive behaviour by
British Gas.
Kinetica, a leading independent gas company, said that when it was
developing plans for a new gas pipeline, British Gas dropped its prices for
that route by almost two-thirds.
Summaries of submissions showed virtually all energy companies favouring a
break-up of British Gas, particularly a separation of its trading and
transportation operations because of the conflict of interest.

FT  07 SEP 93 / LBC may take licence fight to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LBC, THE London commercial radio station that is losing both its frequencies
after 20 years' broadcasting to the capital, is seriously considering
seeking a judicial review of the decision.
Mr Matthew Cartisser, LBC executive director, said one possible ground was
that the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio in the
UK, had indicated that it did not want a rolling news format because this
was under consideration by the BBC.
Yet London News Radio, the consortium which won both LBC frequencies, is
proposing a rolling news format as well as a discussion station.
Mr Cartisser said: 'We think we have been treated very very shabbily by the
Authority. We rescued LBC (after the collapse of parent Crown
Communications) and saved the Radio Authority from embarrassment.'
LBC chairman Dame Shirley Porter told staff yesterday that lawyers had been
consulted on the possibility of seeking a judicial review. She also revealed
that LBC intended to seek one of the new FM licences for London expected to
be advertised next year.
LBC has launched a petition to try to save its Newstalk and London Talkback
channels. More than 80 per cent of more than 60,000 calls received so far
have been on LBC's side.
The broadcaster is, however, to stop using the airwaves to promote its
cause. This, Mr Cartisser said, was understandable in the emotion of the
lost franchise but it would end.
The company has also taken out newspaper advertisements today which repeat
LBC's pledge to fight on.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Arms makers complain of MoD contract delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS IN the placing of Ministry of Defence equipment contracts are causing
increasing concern among arms manufacturers.
Disappointment about the lack of new British purchase announcements was
apparent at yesterday's opening of the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment
Exhibition in Aldershot, organised as a shop window for UK weaponry.
Companies are worried that overdue contracts may now have to await the
government's autumn review of public expenditure, which could bring further
pressure on the British defence budget.
Several deals which had been expected before or during the Aldershot
exhibition have been held up.
They include a deal with Vickers worth up to Pounds 500m, either for a
second large batch of Challenger 2 tanks or for updating current Challenger
1 tanks; purchase of between nine and 15 British Aerospace Sea Harrier jets;
follow-on orders for Rapier and Sea Wolf missiles, also from BAe; and
five-year contracts for supplies of ammunition, principally from BAe's Royal
Ordnance subsidiary.
In addition, the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard is waiting for the government
to invite tenders for up to seven more Sandown class minehunters, of which
it has built five. The invitation was originally promised by the end of
July.
One deal which did materialise yesterday was a contract for Ferranti
International to supply the command control system for the Navy's Pounds
170m new helicopter carrier. The contract was awarded by VSEL, which is due
to build the carrier with the Scottish commercial shipyard Kvaerner Govan.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Independent seeks Pounds 20m: Publisher's financial
restructuring revealed after Times price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing, publisher of The Independent, is planning to raise up
to Pounds 20m in a financial restructuring later this year.
The amount of money is at the upper edge of expectations because of the
competitive threat from the cut-price Times.
The news of the potential scale of the Newspaper Publishing refinancing came
on the first day that The Times has been available nationally for 30p - a
reduction of 15p.
Preliminary reports suggest that the broadsheet daily, one of Mr Rupert
Murdoch's five national newspapers, may have increased sales by 15 per cent
to 20 per cent - a better performance than last month's experiment in Kent.
Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, who first raised the suggestion that
newspapers may be too expensive in the UK, said: 'I am very pleased with the
first day's performance. It reinforces our view that price is a factor in
the market for quality newspapers.'
Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, said its salesmen
estimated that The Times had increased its circulation of about 370,000 by
up to 20 per cent but that the increase had come mainly from new sales.
Associated said: 'It looks like a one-day wonder.' It said the Daily Mail
had not been affected. Other estimates put the increase in sales at closer
to 10 per cent.
The performance of The Times, and whether or not the circulation of The
Independent suffers, will affect the way Newspaper Publishing refinances.
But it is clear that Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing,
and the rest of the board, are keen to strengthen both the finances and the
management of the company.
A number of UK investors are said to be interested and nothing has yet been
ruled out - including selling a majority stake to a larger group. The
emphasis will be on trying to preserve the character of The Independent
while protecting shareholder value.
Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading started informal checks yesterday to
see whether an investigation is justified into what Labour has called 'the
domination of the media by companies under the control of Mr Murdoch'.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Timex ex-staff win Pounds 3m guarantee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISMISSED TIMEX workers in Britain have secured a Pounds 3m legally binding
guarantee from the US-based company to cover any awards they secure from
industrial tribunals for their alleged unfair dismissal.
The company, which shut its Dundee circuit board production plant last week
after a dispute with employees lasting eight months, said yesterday it would
'vigorously defend' itself before the tribunals.
Mr Gavin Laird, the AEEU engineering and electrical union's general
secretary said: 'We are going for the maximum level of award under the law.'
Mr Laird added that Timex had not wanted to provide a financial guarantee of
its good intentions before the industrial tribunal but the union would not
accept this.
Last week the union sought an injunction in a Scottish court against the
company to compel Timex to provide Pounds 3m as a guarantee that it would
honour any awards for the 317 workers involved. The court agreed with the
union.

FT  07 SEP 93 / R-R starts Pounds 60m research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and power systems group, yesterday launched two
six-year programmes to develop advanced technologies for future aero-engines
at a cost of Pounds 60m.
The two programmes, funded by the Ministry of Defence and Rolls-Royce, will
be carried out at the company's military engine facility at Bristol.
The first programme will research and demonstrate ways of applying advanced
technologies to combustors and high-pressure turbines for use in a range of
future engines.
The second programme, known as Near Term Advanced Core Military Engine
Technology, will focus on the demonstration of advanced compression systems,
low-pressure turbines, reheat systems and nozzles.
Mr Stewart Miller, Rolls-Royce director of engineering and technology, said
that the two programmes were relevant to future military engine
applications, advanced short-take-off/vertical-landing power plants, and new
engines for military trainers.
The programmes would have spin-offs into civil engine developments, he
added.

Compared with current combat engine technology, the aims of the new
programmes include a 50 per cent cut in engine mass and a 30 per cent fall
in fuel consumption.
Rolls-Royce said the programmes would help new versions of the Eurojet
EJ200, the power plant being developed for the Eurofighter 2000, and other
future combat engines.

FT  07 SEP 93 / MoD contracts delayed: Defence equipment manufacturers upset
by string of overdue orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS IN the placing of Ministry of Defence equipment contracts are causing
increasing discomfort among arms manufacturers.
Disappointment about the lack of significant new British purchase
announcements was apparent at yesterday's opening of the Royal Navy and
British Army Equipment Exhibition in Aldershot, organised as a shop window
for UK weaponry.
Companies are worried that overdue contracts may now have to await the
government's autumn review of public expenditure, which could bring further
pressure on the British defence budget.
Several deals which had been expected before or during the Aldershot
exhibition have been held up.
They include a deal with Vickers worth up to Pounds 500m, either for a
second large batch of Challenger 2 tanks or for updating current Challenger
1 tanks; purchase of between nine and 15 British Aerospace Sea Harrier jets
to replace aircraft lost in accidents; follow-on orders for Rapier and Sea
Wolf missiles, also from BAe; and five-year contracts for supplies of
ammunition, principally from BAe's Royal Ordnance subsidiary.
In addition, the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard is waiting for the government
to invite tenders for up to seven more Sandown class minehunters, of which
it has built five. The invitation was originally promised by the end of
July.
However Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said at the
exhibition yesterday: 'This is not an occasion for announcing orders.'
Mr Mike Evans, a director of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, said
delays posed the greatest problems for small companies depending on
sub-contracts.
One deal which did materialise yesterday was a contract for Ferranti
International to supply the command control system for the Navy's Pounds
170m new helicopter carrier. The contract, won against strong competition,
was awarded by VSEL, which is due to build the carrier with the Scottish
commercial shipyard Kvaerner Govan.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, is a breakthrough for Ferranti, which in
the late 1980s was ousted from a near-monopoly in command systems for the
Navy.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Army suppliers find silver lining in east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the cold war and cuts in the armed forces have been bad news for
most defence companies but some have found ways of cashing in on the
changes.
Toye, Kenning &amp; Spencer, a long-established Coventry-based manufacturer of
uniforms and insignia, is busy making uniform items for the merged regiments
of the re-organised British army.
And, to prove that every cloud has an embroidered silver lining, it is
seeking to exploit markets in eastern Europe, until recently a no-go area
for British military suppliers.
Mr Philip Frost, managing director, said new business included supplying
badges and buttons to the army's new Royal Logistic Corps, which groups
everyone from drivers to cooks.
Unlike other defence manufacturers, the company had managed to avoid a
decrease in its UK military business, he said.
It was also seeking sales to former Warsaw Pact nations and allies, he said.
It had already sold a uniform package deal to Mozambique, which has changed
its military ranking system from the Soviet to the British style.
The company hoped to increase the 25 per cent of its business devoted to
export. 'We feel we've got an interesting future with the changes that have
occurred,' Mr Frost said.
Also exhibiting at this week's Royal Navy and British Army Equipment
Exhibition in Aldershot is Allmakes Projects, which has a niche business
refitting Russian military trucks.
The company, based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, has found it can buy trucks for
about Pounds 1,000, and, after fitting Perkins diesel engines, re-sell them
for about Pounds 15,000.
Mr Peter Hands, a director, said it had already sold several hundred,
principally to Angola. It was now looking at opportunities in eastern
Europe.
'There's nobody else doing it that we're aware of,' he said.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Travel links under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE CHAINS of travel agents are recommending their parent companies'
holidays to customers, with more than a third offering no alternative, a
report published today by Holiday Which? magazine says.
Magazine staff visited 80 travel outlets. Most of the travel agents which
form part of large groups initially suggested holidays sold by their parent
companies, although some suggested alternatives.
The magazine said three-quarters of Lunn Poly outlets visited suggested
Thomson holidays. Lunn Poly is owned by the Thomson group. Half the shops
later suggested holidays from other operators.
Two-thirds of Thomas Cook branches offered either the chain's own holidays
or those of Owners Abroad, the tour operator with which it is linked.
At Hogg Robinson branches half the initial suggestions were for holidays
from Airtours, the parent company. At Pickfords Travel, also owned by
Airtours, three-quarters offered trips to Paris from the parent company.
Fewer Airtours holidays to Crete were offered by Pickfords staff.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Smith rules out deal on voting reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, is refusing to compromise over the
introduction of one member, one vote in the selection of parliamentary
candidates although he still faces defeat over the issue at the his party's
annual conference in three weeks' time.
According to his aides he is in a 'take-it-or-leave-it' mood on an issue
that threatens the authority of his leader-ship.
Although he will not speak directly on the question in his speech at the
Trades Union Congress in Brighton today, Mr Smith is expected to tell union
leaders privately that while he has no wish to break the party's links with
the unions he has gone far enough to meet their concerns that one member,
one vote will weaken their position in the party.
Mr Smith remains confident that opinion in a number of key unions will move
in his direction on the selection issue once they realise that a defeat for
the party's national executive would plunge Labour into a bitter internal
conflict.
Mr Smith will point out that he has moved some way to meet union anxieties.
One member, one vote will not apply for the election of the Labour party's
leader. That will continue to be carried out through an electoral college in
which the unions will con-tinue to have a substantial voice.
He will be keen to convince unions that if they want to achieve their aims
they need the election of a Labour government at the next general election.
Mr Smith is expected to face criticism over the direction of Labour's
economic policy tonight at a fringe meeting. It is to be attended by Mr
Bryan Gould , the former shadow cabinet member and Mr John Edmonds, the
GMB's general secretary.
Some union leaders dislike the decision by shadow chancellor Gordon Brown to
drop the party's tax-and-spend commitments made before the last election,
and they fear that it has left a policy vacuum.
However, other union leaders are keen to avoid any further commitments by
the party on tax. They succeeded in watering down last week's TUC submission
to the government on its autumn Budget by removing any suggestion that taxes
needed to be raised.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Government backs down on tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment has decided not to challenge a local
authority which required contractors bidding for street cleaning to
indemnify the council against redundancy costs arising from the tender.
South Lakeland district council in Cumbria decided to include an indemnity
clause in the contract because of the continuing uncertainty about the
rights of staff when public services are contracted out.
Private-sector contractors said yesterday that if the practice of requiring
such indemnities spread it could bring compulsory competitive tendering in
local government almost to a standstill.
One contractor who pulled out of the cleaning tender said yesterday that
providing such indemnities was difficult as the liability was difficult to
assess.
Another contractor described the decision as 'spineless'.
He said: 'It makes a nonsense of compulsory competitive tendering.'
The council asked for the indemnity because it was unsure whether the
contract would be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) 1981 regulations. If the Tupe regulations apply, they protect
the jobs and conditions of the workforce when their jobs are transferred to
another employer.
Lakeland council wanted contractors to provide an indemnity clause in case
the contract for street cleaning subsequently turned out to have been
covered by Tupe.
All four private-sector bidders withdrew from the contest and the contract
was awarded to the council's own workforce.
Although the Department of the Environment normally treats indemnity clauses
as 'anti-competitive behaviour', designed to increase the costs of private
contractors, it has told the council that it proposes to take no further
action.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer staff to sue over takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OBSERVER newspaper and the government are being taken to court over the
failure to consult workers about the Sunday newspaper's takeover by The
Guardian.
The GPMU print union, which represents about 35 Observer staff, believes
that the takeover could become a test case for the European Community
Acquired Rights Directive, which requires worker representatives to be
consulted in some mergers.
When the directive was translated into domestic law - as the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations - it was stated that
only workers in recognised unions need be consulted.
That means that in the UK workers who are not in unions or, as at the
Observer, are in unions not recognised by the company, are not consulted.
The GPMU says the failure to introduce broader consultation procedure is
unlawful.
The GPMU case against the Observer will also seek more compensation for
staff who were not consulted about the merger, some of whom have lost their
jobs as a result.

FT  07 SEP 93 / First 125 years of TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE STUMBLE on,' Norman Willis declared in a speech which was supposed to
sum up the TUC's first 125 years and point to the future.
But, Robert Taylor writes, the delegates sat mostly in suppressed mirth as
journalists wrestled with its meaning.
It was a dismal end to a nine-year reign during which the TUC general
secretary denounced violence on the picket lines during the miners' strike
in 1984, in response to which a noose was dangled in front of his face.
Four years later Mr Willis, as an enthusiastic supporter of the European
Community, brought EC president Jacques Delors to speak to the 1988
Congress, a move that more than any other turned Mrs Thatcher against the
social charter.
Union leaders want a fresh start with a clear sense of direction, after the
government's marginalisation of the unions during Mr Willis's reign. So Mr
John Monks will be making the keynote speech at congress on Wednesday - two
days before he officially takes over from Mr Willis.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Tecs chief warns against shrinking skills base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYER-LED Training and Enterprise Councils yesterday warned the
government that any weakening of work-based training would result in many
young people entering dead-end, low-skilled jobs.
Mr John Troth, chairman of the Tec chief executive network, expressed in a
letter to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, 'the greatest possible
concern' at reports in yesterday's FT that there could be cuts in funding
for Youth Training.
This programme, the centrepiece of work-based training for young people, at
present offers a guaranteed place to any 16-to-19-year-old that wants one.
It is understood that the Department for Education is about to present
proposals to divert the majority of the Pounds 850m a year spent on YT by
the Department of Employment into its own expansion of further education.
Instead of funding going through Tecs to employers and providers of
training, it would be be channelled to colleges through the new quango, the
Further Education Funding Council. Colleges would arrange work experience
where appropriate.
Mr Troth, who pledged Tec support for Mr Hunt's efforts to defend YT, said
the work-based route was an essential option for significant numbers of
young people and it should be employer-led.
He said it encouraged employer commitment to training which in turn led to a
widening of employers' training. It also 'kick-started' the process of
lifelong learning.

MR BILL Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, yesterday told the TUC

European economic and social integration.
The Congress voted to establish an office in Brussels.

BIFU, THE banking union, launched a campaign yesterday to embarrass the
Co-operative Bank over the bank's plan to breach an agreement on a lack of
compulsory redundancies, Robert Taylor writes.
The bank plans to shed up to 100 managers and the union is sending postcards
to union members who are customers of the bank calling on them to protest.
The union believes the bank will dismiss clerical staff next year and it is
considering industrial action if the bank does not change its position.

FT  07 SEP 93 / City TV cameras to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY OF London offices are being asked to focus their closed-circuit
television cameras on public places to help combat terrorism and other
crime.
Plans for the 'Camerawatch' scheme were drawn up by the City of London
police following the April 1992 St Mary Axe bombing by the IRA and were
reinforced by the Bishopsgate bomb last April.
Police believe the network of television systems has the potential to
improve security in the City dramatically.
Organisations with cameras are being approached to discover the extent of
their coverage and their efficiency. Information already gathered shows some
public areas which could usefully be covered and others where the system
could be improved.
Companies will be encouraged to switch their cameras to continuous
monitoring of public places. They will be asked to bring the efficiency of
the systems into line with recommendations being developed by the Home
Office.
City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly, who will formally announce
the scheme today, said the knowledge that television systems were operating
would deter terrorist and other criminal activity, and would provide the
means of detection and evidence should offences occur.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Bristol lobbies for EC cash aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BID for much of the Bristol area to receive European Community regional
aid to counter industrial decline was submitted to the Department of Trade
and Industry yesterday.
The designated area stretches from Filton in north Bristol, the home of a
British Aerospace plant, to Hartcliffe, a deprived part of south Bristol. It
has seen the loss of more than 6,500 industrial jobs because of the
recession and cuts in defence and aerospace. The local unemployment rate is
19 per cent.
Mr Graham Robertson, leader of Bristol City Council, said: 'The area's
economic strength has been sapped to a degree that ought to make it a prime
candidate for EC help.'
The city council, with the county council, Northavon district council and
Western Development Partnership, Avon's newly formed economic lobby group,
are making the case for Objective 2 status, which gives access to EC funds
for areas of industrial decline.
The existing Objective 2 map is being redrawn and the DTI will forward its
proposals for areas to be included to Brussels by the end of the month.
Aided projects will have to have matching public or private finance. The
UK's total allocation of Objective 2 funds for next year has yet to be
decided by the EC.
A joint bid for EC regional aid has been submitted to the DTI by the county
councils in Staffordshire and Derbyshire in conjunction with the Peak Park
Planning Board. The councils are seeking Objective 5b status to help
modernise rural areas.
Bristol Airport, owned by the city council, yesterday reported record
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m for the year to March 31, up 211 per cent on
the previous year. Passenger traffic rose by nearly a third to 1.1m.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Policy on IRA faces scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is likely to be forced to mount a defence of its
rules of engagement against the IRA before the European Court of Justice.
The Strasbourg-based European Commission of Human Rights ruled yesterday
that the controversial killings of three IRA members in Gibraltar five years
ago could be heard by the European Court.
The ruling was hailed as a significant victory by relatives of the victims
who have argued that the shooting violated the European Convention of Human
Rights, guaranteeing the right to life.
The case was taken to Strasbourg after a Gibraltar coroner's inquest - at
which evidence was withheld by the government on grounds of national
security - declared the killings lawful.
Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers said they killed the three IRA members
under the Ministry of Defence's 'rules of engagement', which permit soldiers
to open fire if there is a threat to life.
It was declared in the coroner's court that the SAS soldiers had acted after
being briefed that the three IRA terrorists had planted a bomb in Gibraltar
linked to them by remote control, and that they were probably armed.
Relatives of the family have always contended that the killings were
unnecessary as British intelligence had information from their Spanish
counterparts that they were not armed.
The commission yesterday signalled it had doubts about the case, although
its support for a full court action will not be published for a month.
The Foreign Office said last night that the UK government remained
'convinced' that the SAS soldiers acted 'lawfully'.
One Foreign Office official said: 'If the case is brought to the European
court, our defence will be vigorous.' Whitehall has been advised by its
legal experts that the case could take anything between a year and six years
to unravel.
The Irish government, which initially condemned the killings, yesterday
refused to comment publicly on the case.
Dublin officials privately indicated that they had no wish to become
embroiled in the case at a European level for political reasons.
However, legal experts working for Amnesty International, the group which
campaigns for human rights, predicted last night that any eventual ruling by
the European Court against the government could force changes to legislation
in the UK and bring the definition of the justified use of force closer into
line with the con-vention.
Amnesty believes that although the court's decision would not be directly
binding in UK courts, British authorities could find it difficult to ignore.

FT  07 SEP 93 / MPs seek bigger role in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO give MPs an opportunity to vote on different combinations of tax,
spending and borrowing from those put forward by the government in the
Budget were recommended yesterday by the Commons procedure committee.
If MPs accept the committee's report Tory rebels and opposition parties
would be allowed greater scope to put forward their schemes.
The committee said that backbenchers should be able to propose amendments on
which votes could be held, suggesting tax or spending changes. They should
also be able to approve borrowing plans as part of the Budget motion.
To keep in line with Commons practice, amendments would be phrased as
expressions of opinion. Although these would not bind the government,
ministers would have to take them seriously.
Under the present arrangements, a range of issues can be raised in the
Budget debate but there is no mechanism for putting many of them to the
vote.
Sir Peter Emery, the Tory chairman of the committee, said the report should
be discussed by MPs before the Budget on November 30.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Labour attacks premium rises

<TEXT>
A LABOUR party survey shows that the average family faces a 19 per cent
increase in its household insurance bill this year, Richard Lapper writes.
The survey of premiums set by nine companies in 11 areas also shows that the
highest quote is likely to be 2 1/2 -times more expensive than the cheapest.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'Customers are
getting a raw deal. I want to see these insurance companies make clear to
their policyholders by how much premiums are being increased, and then to
justify their behaviour. They should not get away with exploiting consumers
in this way.'

FT  07 SEP 93 / British Gas saw future sales loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that its share of the
UK gas market would fall to 68.5 per cent by 1998 compared with a share of
91.8 per cent last year.
In a submission made last year and published in yesterday's MMC report, the
company indicated that it expected competitors to win a large part of its
market for industrial customers, particularly power stations. However, it
expected to retain 100 per cent of the regulated tariff market for small
customers, including households.
The forecast was based on an earlier agreement between the company and the
Office of Fair Trading whereby the company would cut its share of the
non-tariff market to 40 per cent by 1995. Since then the MMC has recommended
that more of the tariff market be thrown open to new competitors by 1997.
This forecast is one of the few in the MMC report that has survived the
censor's scissors. Much of the information supplied to the commission has
been erased from the report because of its commercially sensitive nature.
Several pages in the 1,000-page document are blank.
Other information supplied by the company includes a detailed calculation of
the costs of various proposals for restructuring the company. These ranged
from a net present cost of Pounds 330m to implement the arrangements already
agreed with the OFT, to Pounds 2.9bn for a complete break-up of British Gas
into separate operating companies and several regional distribution
companies.
In recommending the partial break-up of the company, the commission later
said it believed these estimates were unnecessarily high.
The report also includes details of submissions from other energy companies.
Many complain about alleged predatory and anti-competitive behaviour by
British Gas.
Kinetica, a leading independent gas company, said that when it was
developing plans for a new gas pipeline, British Gas dropped its prices for
that route by almost two-thirds.
Summaries of submissions showed virtually all energy companies favouring a
break-up of British Gas, particularly a separation of its trading and
transportation operations because of the conflict of interest.
A notable exception was Shell, one of the largest North Sea gas producers.
The company told the MMC that it did not believe that a total break-up of
British Gas was necessary because this was likely to 'impair efficient
planning and operation at a time when these key activities were becoming
more difficult'. Instead, Shell advocated the division of the company into
two distinct, auditable cost centres.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Ministers defend release of 6-year-old beef
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS YESTERDAY dismissed fears about the quality and safety of
six-year-old beef that has been sold from frozen storage on to the market,
saying it was 'perfectly fit for human consumption'.
The Labour party and the Consumers' Association have protested about the
fact that the beef, dating from 1986 and held in UK intervention stores as
part of the EC beef mountain, was released to shops without being
date-stamped.
A European Commission official in Brussels said yesterday that beef from
intervention stores was meant to be sold on a 'first in, first out' basis
and the batch of 25 tonnes of six-year-old beef 'should have been sold three
years ago'.
The official added, however, that inspectors from the Ministry of
Agriculture had found the beef to be in a perfect state.
Mr Stephen Briggs, spokesman for the intervention board which administers
the stocks in Britain, said there were no rules about the maximum time
intervention stocks could be stored.
Mr Briggs denied that agriculture officials had overlooked the date and
could not confirm the exact amount and source of the beef. He agreed,
however, that it was normal to sell the oldest meat first.
'The Commission is right that the aim is to sell the oldest stocks first,
but you can't force people to buy it if they don't want it and there's no
indication this was due to an oversight,' he said.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said intervention beef stocks
were stored in 'ideal' conditions and checked and monitored at regular
intervals.
Fears of contamination by bovine spongiform encephalopathy - 'mad cow
disease' - were unfounded since intervention stocks never contained the
animal tissue which has to be removed from beef under 1988 safety
regulations, ministry officials said.
Mr Nicholas Soames, food minister, said cold-store beef would continue to be
sold and there was no need for it to be labelled by age, although butchers
should warn consumers not to re-freeze it.
Britain has 144,000 tonnes of beef in 95 stores around the UK, out of total
EC stocks of about 860,000 tonnes. Mr Briggs said most of the British beef
dated from 1990 or later, although there was still about 100 tonnes from
1989. Six years was the longest beef had been held in the UK before being
sold, he added.
This older meat occasionally remained in intervention, either because the
cut was unpopular or because it was held in a store in a remote location
that beef traders found inconvenient, he said.
Mr Briggs said the beef was frozen and then stored at temperatures below
minus 18 degrees centigrade. This was the temperature used for frozen
produce in supermarkets.

A REPORT on the riot at Wymott Prison in Lancashire is likely to be with
Home Secretary Michael Howard before the end of the month, it emerged
yesterday. The Home Office said initial estimates of the damage were between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m.
Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, will lead the inquiry.
He will report directly to the Home Secretary, who will decide whether to
publish all or parts of his findings.
The riot echoed an outbreak of violence in April 1986, when 200 prisoners
went on the rampage causing 'immense' damage.
Prison sources said yesterday it was hoped that an interim report, either
oral or written, would be given to Mr Howard before the end of the month
with the full written report to follow soon after.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan pressed to lift rice import ban -
Poor harvest will mean shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN may be forced to import rice for emergency supplies because of this
year's poor rice harvest, the result of cold weather and a spate of
typhoons.
The rice shortage coincides with mounting pressure on Japan to open its rice
market within the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. While
the Ministry of Agriculture denies that there is a shortage, industry
analysts point out emergency rice imports will be inevitable.
Japan relaxed its ban on rice imports on one occasion, for 150,000 tonnes of
rice from South Korea in 1984, to make up for a shortage.
This time the government is facing increasing pressure from the US and other
leading rice producers.
Mr David Graves, president of the US Rice Millers Association, last month
called for Japan to buy American rice for emergency imports, while the
Australian government has also lobbied Tokyo.
The coalition government under Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has
backed the import ban. Many members of the coalition are supported by rural
constituencies. Electoral reform, which Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce
this year, is expected to correct the under-represented urban vote and
dilute the powerful rice lobby, quickening the pace of liberalisation.
As of August 15, the Agriculture Ministry said the rice harvest index stood
at 95 against the average harvest of 100. However, Mr Yoshiro Takahashi of
Rice Databank, a private research organisation on rice, says the final index
could fall below 90, and the actual shortfall could rise to 700,000 tonnes.
The average annual demand is 10.6m tonnes.
The ministry intends to review its policy of reducing rice production,
established in 1971 to prevent an oversupply. The ministry is now asking
local governments to find out whether farmers who turned their rice paddies
into vegetable and fruit fields wish to resume rice growing.
Japan and the US will meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss a framework
for a new economic partnership, Reuter adds.
The environment, technology, human resource development, population control
and Aids will be discussed, along with Japan's global trade surplus.
Japan's global trade surplus grew to Dollars 11.82bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in July
from Dollars 9.23bn a year earlier. The surplus with the US climbed to
Dollars 4.68bn from Dollars 3.81bn.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: China faces sanctions over rhino horns
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANCTIONS against China and Taiwan for illegal trading in rhino horns will
today be considered by the 120-nation UN Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (Cites), David Gardner writes from Brussels.
The standing committee of Cites, meeting in Brussels, is examining
allegations that these countries have failed to stamp out the trade, banned
since 1976.
The sanctions could take the form of a ban on virtually all wild animal
products from and into China and Taiwan, not just products from rare
animals, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency.
The last Cites standing committee meeting in Washington last March decided
to defer any decision until after further consultations with China and
Taiwan.
The EIA and the World Society for the Protection of Animals say that in July
 -a month after both governments claimed to have ended the trade - their
teams found a one-tonne stockpile of rhino horn in China, equivalent to the
number of rhinos now surviving in Zimbabwe. In Taiwan, 19 out of 24
pharmacies admitted to stocking rhino horn - used for reducing fever - while
two-thirds of Hong Kong chemists had rhino horn for sale.

THE Greek government has shortlisted five international consortia to bid for
a Dr80bn (Pounds 225m) project to build a single-line underground railway
for Thessaloniki in northern Greece.
The Public Works Ministry said the contract for the 9.3km underground would
be awarded at the end of this year, with construction due to start early in
1994.
The ministry indicated that bidders who could guarantee completion of the
turnkey project by 1997, the year when Thessaloniki becomes cultural capital
of Europe, would hold an advantage in the selection process.
Thessaloniki has already launched a Dr30bn public works programme to improve
the city's infrastructure and cultural facilities.
The twin-track line, crossing the city centre, will be constructed at a
depth of 15 metres, well below an extensive archaeological layer containing
remains of the city's Roman and Byzantine past. However, a considerable
amount of archaeological excavation, which could cause delays, will still be
needed.
The Greek state is to cover half the project's cost and will also subsidise
fares. The remainder of the financing is to be provided by the contractor,
which will be entitled to operate the system for 25 years. According to
preliminary studies, 30m-50m passengers a year would use the underground.
The five contenders are: Interinfra, a French consortium involved in a
project to extend the Athens underground system; Alexandrian Metro, led by
Siemens of Germany, which is also participating in the Athens project;
Mechaniki, led by a northern Greek construction company; Louygues, a French,
Canadian and Greek consortium including Bouygues of France and Bombardier of
Canada; and Iris-Rommetro, a Greek-Romanian group.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Hungary is model in mobile phone scramble
for E Europe - Prospects for western companies in a region where the phones
don't work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY western investors have gone cool on an eastern Europe mired in
recession. But not the US and European telecommunications companies that
campaigned for two concessions to operate digital mobile communications
which Hungary awarded at the end of last month.
A group led by regional Bell operator US West and another of national
telecoms companies from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland won the
tenders over DBFH Consortium, a coalition of Deutsche Telekom, France
Telecom and British Telecom.
Bids surpassed expectations: the two successful consortia offered nearly
Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) between them for the rights to operate eastern
Europe's first wireless services based on the pan-European GSM digital
standard for the next generation of cellular phone networks.
On top of the concession fee, the winning contenders committed themselves to
network development which could cost Dollars 400m over 10 years.
International interest in Hungary's GSM tender has been feverish, partly
because Hungary is widely regarded as the 'model' for the rest of eastern
Europe.
US West has been particularly active, recently winning tenders to develop
digital mobile networks in 10 Russian cities. The company also has stakes in
existing analogue mobile concessions in east-central Europe. It partners
Hungarian Telecommunications Company in the Westel joint venture in Hungary
and has teamed up with US counterpart Bell Atlantic and local operators in
the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
In Poland, Ameritech of the US, France Telecom and local partners have
invested Dollars 120m in their Centertel joint venture. Meanwhile, various
Scandinavian operators are embarking on wireless communications development
in the Baltic republics.
Further south in the former Soviet Union, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Denmark
and PTT Netherlands have combined to provide mobile phones in 21 Ukrainian
cities.
The rash of deals in eastern Europe owes something to the worldwide fashion
for cellular communications. Greece set a new benchmark for emerging markets
by selling off two GSM digital concessions last year for a total of Dollars
320m.
Eastern Europe has particular strategic value for some companies. US West,
for instance, hopes that its growing presence will allow 'backdoor' access
to European Community markets as the two halves of the continent come
closer. And a representative of the 'Nordic' operators which campaigned so
vigorously for the Hungarian GSM concession says that the area is
'strategically vital' if they are not to be cordoned off in home markets.
Another draw is that east European governments are moving towards liberal
telecommunications regimes to attract finance from abroad. They have little
alternative. Improvement of telecommunications is a priority and budget
deficits preclude extra government spending.
The decisive enticement, however, has been the spark-ling initial
performance of the east European market for mobile communications, which has
shrugged off the region's general recession.
Take Hungary. When Westel, US West's existing Hungarian joint venture, began
providing an analogue mobile service three years ago, customers queued up
outside its offices. Penetration has been much more rapid than in the west.
Westel has 33,000 subscribers and expects to have 40,000 by the time the
company's investment of Dollars 85m brings nationwide coverage at the end of
the year.
Hungarian subscribers, moreover, spend nearly three times as much time on
their mobile phones than the average user in western Europe, despite stiffer
charges. No wonder rivals describe Hungary as 'the jewel in the crown' of US
West's east European operations.
Hungary's new breed of entrepreneurs, temperamentally status-conscious, are
particularly avid mobile phone users. 'Maybe it is to do with the Hungarian
nature: they are the traders of central Europe,' says Mr Richard Spandler,
head of international mobile services for Telecom Denmark.
But Hungary's neighbours are no cellular slouches. US West's Czech and
Slovak ventures have about 10,000 subscribers, for instance, and they are
also heavy users. Poland's Centertel expects 20,000 customers by the end of
this year.
Common to the region is the inadequacy of the standard telephone network.
Waiting lists attest to suppressed demand for telephones in the region,
which programmes for investment in landlines will take years to satisfy.
Survey evidence from Hungary is that half of subscribers to existing
analogue mobile services have no access to a standard telephone line. They
are the only communications option for many businesspeople. Short of getting
into a car, that is.

FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Boeing opens technical research centre in
Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday
opened a technical research centre in Moscow, reflecting the growing trend
of collaboration between Russian and western aerospace groups.
The Boeing centre follows a year of planning with leaders of the Russian
commercial aerospace industry. It is equipped with computer facilities for
use by Russian research engineers and scientists who will work under
contract to Boeing.
Boeing said the centre's initial projects would include research into
aerodynamics, special alloys and the impact of sub-zero weather on aircraft
fuel systems.
If research projects proved fruitful, there would be benefits to current and
future civil aircraft programmes including studies on a 600-800 seater super
jumbo airliner and a new generation of supersonic aircraft.
Boeing is already studying development of a super jumbo with the four
European partners in the Airbus programme, including British Aerospace,
Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain.
All the partners have already indicated they would be interested in
extending their collaboration to other manufacturers, including Russian
aerospace groups.
Boeing has been anxious to exploit the long-term potential of the commercial
aircraft market in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia's
well-established research and scientific expertise.
For their part, Russian manufacturers have been keen to forge close links
with western companies to secure new sources of hard currency funding and
access to western markets.
Boeing, which has already supplied 737 twin engine airliners to CIS
airlines, expects domestic traffic in the CIS to grow by around 3 per cent a
year between now and 2010, while international traffic to and from the CIS
is forecast to grow annually by 5 per cent.
Over the next 16 years, Boeing expects demand for 1,300 new aircraft for
domestic use in the CIS and a further 250 aircraft for international use,
worth a total of Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn) at current dollar values.

ITALY SAID it could delay the withdrawal of its troops from Mogadishu, the
Somali capital, for areas to the north, after a United Nations request
yesterday that the troops stay, Reuter reports from Rome.
Defence Minister Fabio Fabbri told Italian state television 'the
(withdrawal) could be delayed, but only by a few days. It will not be
cancelled. Right now we are trying to define the conditions and the timing
of an eventual delay.' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had
asked Italy to delay its withdrawal following a weekend ambush in which
seven Nigerian peacekeepers died, a government spokesman said.
The Italians were due to quit Mogadishu at midnight yesterday after a row in
June and July in which they were accused of taking orders from Rome rather
than UN command. Italy is a former colonial power in Somalia.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Toshiba to swing axe at 5,000 jobs: Electronics giant
follows lead on staff cuts by other groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the electronics group, yesterday became the latest large Japanese
industrial company to take an axe to its costs, by announcing it would shed
5,000 staff.
The job losses are to take place over the next three to five years through
natural wastage, as Toshiba hires fewer graduates and continues to make
older staff retire at the same rate.
Like many other Japanese companies, Toshiba has seen its earnings fall for
the past three years, in line with the decline in most of its main markets.
This follows last week's announcement of 10,000 job losses at NTT, the
telecommunications group which is Japan's biggest industrial employer.
That set an important precedent for other companies believed to be keen to
cut their workforces in response to the economic slowdown, but which had
hesitated because of the social unacceptability of making job cuts in Japan.
Toyota and Nissan, the carmakers, earlier this year announced smaller
workforce reductions, also through natural wastage. Japanese industrial
companies have so far avoided making heavy redundancies, unlike US and
European competitors, though the pressure on costs continues.
Further evidence of manufacturing industry's problems came yesterday when
the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers reported a 6.2 per
cent decline in orders for industrial machinery in July, compared with the
same month the previous year.
Domestic orders were stagnant, in line with Japanese companies'
unwillingness to commit themselves to new investment. Foreign orders fell
36.4 per cent, a mark of the impact on export markets of the strong yen.
Separately, the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association reported that
year-on-year machine tool orders fell 27 per cent in July, continuing a
decline that started in December 1990. The association blamed this latest
fall on poor orders from consumer electronics and general machinery
producers.
Another industrial bellwether, energy consumption, recorded a mere 0.5 per
cent rise, the smallest for six years, in the 12 months to March, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday. The main factor
in this was a 2 per cent decline in energy consumption by industrial users,
the first fall since the last economic slowdown in 1986.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday announced measures aimed at curbing soaring investment in
fixed assets, the main cause of inflation and economic instability, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
National newspapers published an order from the State Council (cabinet)
listing seven measures to regulate investment and try to direct it along
government guidelines.
Fixed asset investment increased 70 per cent in the first seven months of
1993, driving up prices of raw materials and helping to keep the urban
inflation rate in July at 23.3 per cent.
The State Council ordered all regions and departments to reassess projects
and go ahead only with those that were efficient or that eased bottlenecks
in the system. Projects without the necessary capital, that do not match
national policy or have no clear market, especially high-class hotels,
offices and villas, must be rigorously reassessed.
It said that funds, including foreign loans and those saved from suspended
projects, must be concentrated on priority state projects such as
agriculture, transport, telecommunications, power and production of raw
materials.
In principle no new projects should be approved in the year's second half,
and banks would not lend to property projects with no official approval, the
State Council said.
The measures are the latest in a series since a 16-point plan unveiled in
early July by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, when he took over as chief of the
central bank, aimed at cooling the overheated economy.
Last week Mr Zhu stressed the successes of his programme - a stable yuan
exchange rate, recovery of a third of illegal bank loans and a curb on
property speculation.

WORLD air networks could crumble if the industry's recession dragged on, Mr
Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the International Air Transport
Association (Iata), said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cairo. Losses this
year would reach 'several billion' dollars, he estimated.
Mr Jeanniot told airline leaders and analysts that their troubles were far
from over. 'What can happen over the next few years is the potential
degeneration of international air networks.'
If losses continued, more airlines would fold and the industry could
implode. As the number of destinations served by airlines dropped, unit
costs would rise, causing more bankruptcies.
Mr Gerald Baliles, chairman of a US commission into the industry this year,
said it was vital to scrap 'archaic' bilateral air traffic pacts and develop
a multilateral system.

WITH recession in Europe cutting into the revenues of the Venice
Simplon-Orient-Express, Mr James Sherwood - who heads the Sea Containers
shipping group and its affiliate Orient-Express Hotels - is launching a
luxury train service between Bangkok and Singapore to take advantage of
tourism growth in Asia.
The new Eastern &amp; Oriental (E&amp;O) Express is already plying the 1,943-km
route up and down the Malayan peninsula and is expected to be opened
officially on September 19. An initial investment of about Dollars 23m
(Pounds 15.2m) and months of negotiations with the Thai and Malaysian
governments and railway authorities were required to bring the project to
fruition.
The E&amp;O is the first scheduled train to take passengers all the way from
Singapore to Bangkok - normally they have to change trains at Butterworth in
north Malaysia - and a Thai law had to be changed to allow a private company
to run trains on the Thai state rail network. Immigration officers from
Bangkok are flown down to the Malaysian border at E&amp;O's expense each time
the train enters Thailand.
Mr Sherwood took the precaution of involving Malaysian and Thai companies
with good government contacts in the project. Malaysian property companies
YTL and Landmarks hold 32 per cent and 18 per cent respectively; Orchid
Lodge, majority owned by the Thai conglomerate Italthai, and Orient-Express
Hotels each have 25 per cent.
The two-day E&amp;O journey, starting from Pounds 740 per person for a one-way
ticket between Bangkok and Singapore, is marketed as an experience, like a
luxury cruise, rather than as a means of transport.
'Everything pointed to south-east Asia, which I have got to know well
because many of my other business activities are concentrated there,' Mr
Sherwood says of his decision to launch the service. Because of the climate,
tourism there is a year-round business, he observes. The Venice
Simplon-Orient-Express, launched in 1982, suffers from the seasonal nature
of tourism in Europe and has recently been hit by recession and a dearth of
American visitors.
E&amp;O executives say they already have 6,000 advance bookings for the Asian
journey, equivalent to more than half a year's trips. Each train can take
132 passengers.
Mr Sherwood and his colleagues are already considering other destinations in
Asia, including Cambodia - site of the ancient Khmer temples of Angkor Wat -
and China.

<TEXT>
MR Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is to
meet Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak today amid signs of concerted
diplomatic efforts to speed the signing of framework peace agreements
between Israel and all its Arab neighbours.
Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel, appears to be
playing a key mediating role in background diplomacy aimed at fulfilling a
stated US desire for Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to conclude outline
agreements with Israel as part of a comprehensive deal under the terms of
the present Middle East peace talks.
The US has nominated September 13 for a possible signing ceremony and
indicated it could be held at the White House if Syria, Jordan and Lebanon
were also placed to join the Palestinians in concluding accords with the
Israelis.
But Syria and Lebanon both indicated yesterday that this date appeared
optimistic. Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syrian foreign minister, told reporters in
Beirut there had been 'nothing new on the Syrian path' of the negotiations
in Washington during the present round. Mr Faris Bouez, his Lebanese
counterpart, also said that 'we cannot say there is any progress compared
with the previous rounds'.
One indication of the intensified diplomatic manoeuvring was the decision of
King Hussein of Jordan to postpone a visit to China early next week. A
palace spokesman cited a flurry of activity on the Middle East peace front
as a reason for the postponement.
Mr Arafat held talks in Cairo yesterday with Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian
foreign minister, after his arrival from Damascus. The two sides are
believed to have focused on ways of shoring up Arab support for the PLO
agreement with Israel.
Arab officials said a statement of support for the Israel-Palestinian deal
by the Gulf Co-operation Council, representing six Gulf states, was
significant since it ensured a majority within the Arab League for the peace
deal.
Gulf foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh said the GCC continued to 'support
peace efforts. . . in the hope that (Arab-Israeli) negotiations would make
substantive progress along all tracks to push the peace process forward.'
This was a reference to parallel talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon and
Jordan.
On his arrival in Cairo yesterday, Mr Arafat denied that Syrian endorsement
for the plan had been lukewarm. He described his talks on Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad as 'brotherly, warm and dignified'. He told
reporters: 'I have thanked President Assad for the meeting, for his
understanding and for all the advice he has given, especially in this
atmosphere and the developments that the Palestinian and Arab cause is
passing through.'

THE peace agreement with Palestinians could lead to the development of an
independent Palestinian state, Israel's ambassador to the US said yesterday.
This marks the erosion of yet another long-held Israeli taboo in the rapidly
moving peace process.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich said in a television interview both sides recognised
that a permanent settlement to the occupied lands was 'an open issue' to be
decided in talks in three years, but a Palestinian state 'could happen'. His
remarks will fuel opposition by the Israeli right-wing, which plans a
100,000-strong demonstration tonight.
Israeli officials continued to insist yesterday that the peace agreement
with Palestinians could be signed in Washington by next Monday, once the
Palestine Liberation Organisation concluded talks about issuing a letter
renouncing violence and recognising Israel's right to exist. In a six-point
text of the PLO letter awaited by Israel, published yesterday in the Hebrew
daily Yediot Ahronot, the PLO is also expected to suspend the intifada, the
Palestinian uprising, and agree to resolve future disputes between the two
sides in a joint arbitration committee.
According to the text, Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will say: 'I am
turning to the residents of the territories to return to a normalisation of
lives between both sides.'
Mr Rabinovich's comments on the possibility on an independent Palestinian
state, no matter how tentative and exploratory, will further enrage Israel's
right-wing. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, yesterday
declared that the Jewish state's 'very existence was at stake' and said he
was puzzled and incredulous at the pace of the peace process.
Right-wing settlers in Jerusalem said they would barricade the office of Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, for up to two days starting today.
Three firebombs were thrown into the courtyard of a Jerusalem hotel during a
wedding yesterday, slightly injuring three Israelis, police said, Reuter
reports from Jerusalem. Radical Palestinians opposed to an accord have vowed
to attack Israelis.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Nigeria oil strike lifted

NIGERIA'S main oil workers' union yesterday suspended its 10-day strike,
which was aimed at pressing the interim government to recognise the outcome
of the June presidential elections.
Most other trade unions voted to end their strike last week, but the Nupeng
union's block on fuel supplies has stopped normal operations in government
and the private sector throughout southern Nigeria. Nupeng is expected to
lift the strike with immediate effect, but public and commercial transport
will need most of this week to return to normal.
Nupeng's leaders described the suspension as a 'tactical withdrawal. . .
allowing a truce to give authorities time to review their position on the
12th June presidential elections and find a solution acceptable to the
victors and the vast majority of people.'
The other members of the Nigeria Labour Congress called off the strike when
the interim government backed down over the proposed 10-fold rise in the
price of petrol, but the oil workers' strike action was entirely political.
Nupeng was aiming to force the government to hand over to Mr Moshood Abiola,
banned winner of the presidential polls who is taking refuge in Britain; its
leaders hinted at more strikes to back their cause.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Reforms lift exports 27%

INDIA'S exports are growing strongly in the wake of its economic reforms and
the devaluation of the rupee over the past two years, according to figures
published yesterday.
After two years' sluggish growth, exports in the first four months of the
financial year, which started in April, rose 27 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn
(Pounds 4.56bn), far exceeding the government's expectations. This compares
with growth of under 5 per cent in the year to the end of March.
The sudden increase in growth has given rise to hopes that India is at last
seeing the benefits of the reform programme launched in 1991 by the
government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Exports of textiles,
leather goods and agricultural goods are growing strongly, as are those of
engineering products.
But the surge in performance this year also includes shipments of goods
delayed in the first three months by the religious disturbances which hit
the country following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque and terrorist bombs
in Bombay.
Imports in the first four months were 7 per cent down at Dollars 7.35bn, due
to low demand for machinery and industrial raw materials. However, companies
continue to be concerned about possible foreign competition as barriers to
the entry of imports come down.
However, the decline in imports is helping to maintain India's foreign
exchange reserves at a high level of about Dollars 7bn, on latest figures.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Israel wants to hold on to Golan listening post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL is poised to negotiate with Syria on a phased withdrawal from the
occupied Golan Heights in coming weeks, but will insist on making the area a
demilitarised zone and keeping an electronic listening post there once
Israeli troops depart, an Israeli negotiator said yesterday.
Mr David Kimche, a former top Foreign Ministry and intelligence official who
is now an Israeli delegate to the multilateral Middle East peace talks, told
a press conference that Israel was convinced Syria's President Hafez
al-Assad was intent on a deal with the Jewish state and would be spurred
towards detailed negotiations by the imminent agreements between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
But he said both sides would prefer to implement such an understanding
gradually, with Syria normalising relations in steps over several years,
while Israel moved off the Golan Heights, which it occupied in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
Mr Kimche's analysis, based on intelligence accounts of recent political
deliberations in Damascus, was that Mr Assad was not ready to move rapidly
to full normalisation. Equally, Israel would need a phased agreement like
that under which it handed Sinai back to Egypt in the late 1970s, leaving
behind a multinational peacekeeping force.
This would enable it to safeguard the security of its northern regions,
which Syrian forces on the Golan threatened during the 1960s, and deal with
the Israeli settlers who have since built homes and farms on the strategic
heights.
The extent of any Israeli withdrawal is likely to remain the principal bone
of contention in what is universally expected to be the toughest part of the
bilateral Arab-Israeli talks still to come.
Syria will insist Israel commits itself to a complete pullout, while Israel
would prefer to make a declaration in principle of Syrian sovereignty over,
and demilitarisation of, the Golan, leaving details such as the composition
of any multi-national observer force to be sorted out subsequently.
'We will have to decide whether we can do that (withdraw completely) - and
if so, how we are to be compensated from the point of view of security and
settlers,' said Mr Kimche, stressing that the modalities of withdrawal had
yet to be broached in the negotiations.
'But I cannot see by any means that we would agree to Syrian soldiers going
back to the Golan.'
Israel's Golan electronic listening facilities were its 'eyes and ears on
what's going on in Syria,' he said. He added Israel might agree to a third
party - such as the US - taking over the listening post, provided Israel had
access to the information.
Mr Kimche said that although Mr Assad had evidently been angered by the
PLO's failure to consult him on its deal with Israel, this would help him
also make peace.
He also said Israel would withdraw fully from territory in south Lebanon
provided the PLO and Syria undertook to curtail attacks on Israel's northern
border by the Islamic militant group, Hizbollah.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Mehta probe fears hit Indian shares: Inspectors freeze
dealing in leading stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN shares fell sharply yesterday following news that income tax
inspectors had frozen dealings in large blocks of leading stocks as part of
an investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the
centre of last year's Bombay financial scandal.
Even though the Bombay Stock Exchange urged investors to stay calm, the
index of 30 leading shares fell 42.86 points to 2,621.20 amid concern that
the inspectors' order could prevent trading in certain stocks for an
indefinite period.
The exchange said in a statement that the inspectors' freeze applied only to
specified blocks of shares in nine stocks and not to all trading in these
stocks.
Last night it said the total value of the shares was some Rs1.5bn (Pounds
31.7m).
The inspectors' action has undermined the recent optimism in the market
inspired by evidence of foreign financial institutions buying large amounts
of Indian shares for the first time.
The inspectors' orders apply to shares held by 134 companies and individuals
connected to Mr Jagdish Narayan Bhatt, a Bombay stockbroker who dealt on
behalf of Mr Mehta. The stocks in question are all large Indian companies.
They include Reliance Industries, the chemicals and textiles group, Great
Eastern Shipping, the transport company, and ITC, the tobacco and hotels
group which is part owned by BAT of the UK.
The income tax inspectors' investigation began last year after Mr Mehta was
arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn scandal which rocked the
Bombay securities market last year. Mr Mehta and others were accused of
trading illegally in the interbank securities market in order to siphon
funds into the stock market.
While the Criminal Board of Investigation probed the accusations of illegal
trading, the income tax authorities began to examine possible infringements
of income tax law by Mr Mehta. The tax investigation culminated in
yesterday's announcement.
Mr Mehta, who denies all wrongdoing, is fighting his case hard. Earlier this
year he claimed he had presented Mr P V Narashima Rao, the prime minister,
with a suitcase full of cash. The statement rocked political circles and led
to a no-confidence debate in parliament. Mr Narashima Rao won the vote but
has not been able to dispel fully the damage done by Mr Mehta's claim.
Punjab National Bank, one of the largest and most prosperous of India's
state-owned banks, has taken over New Bank of India, a lossmaking state
bank.
The long-awaited move, first mooted by the Finance Ministry in 1990, was
seen by officials as the only way of saving the New Bank of India from
collapse. But the takeover was held up by disputes over the relative
seniority of staff at the two banks.
New Bank of India lost Rs754m in the year to March, and the Punjab National
Bank made a net profit of Rs380m.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Mexico reserves at record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LUHNOW
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO has announced record levels of international reserves, which should
further ease perennial worries of a currency devaluation and give the
government more scope to boost the sluggish economy without fuelling
inflation.
The Banco de Mexico announced on Sunday that international reserves grew to
Dollars 22.6bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end August, a Dollars 4.03bn increase
from the end of last year. The trade ledger is also looking better,
officials said. For the first half of the year, the current account deficit
stood at Dollars 10bn, 4 per cent less than at the same time last year,
while the capital accounts to finance the deficit jumped to Dollars 14bn.
'The strength of the Mexican economy gives the government a lot of room to
manoeuvre,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, of Baring Securities.
A tight grip on money under President Carlos Salinas has slowed inflation to
8 per cent a year and created a budget surplus of more than Dollars 4bn
dollars for the first half of the year. But it has also choked the economy:
manufacturing stagnated at 0.3 per cent annual growth for the first half of
the year, according to official figures. Economists expect year-end growth
of 1.5 per cent.
Higher growth ahead of next July's presidential elections is widely seen as
politically desirable for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party.
Addressing a banker's conference on Sunday, Mr Salinas said his government
would run a balanced budget for the rest of this year, boosting spending by
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn.
There are also signs the government will use an extra Dollars 8bn, including
proceeds from recent media privatisations, to finance a highway project in
the south.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Campbell to call October election

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S prime minister, Ms Kim Campbell, is set to call a general election
in the next day or two for October 25.
The poll, just a month short of the expiry of the ruling Progressive
Conservatives' five-year mandate, promises to be one of the most closely
fought and unpredictable in recent Canadian history. Pre-election jitters
have already unsettled financial markets. The Canadian dollar fell sharply
last week, forcing a jump in short-term interest rates.
The usual three-way battle among the Conservatives, the opposition Liberals
and the left-of-centre New Democratic party is complicated this time by the
presence of two popular regional groups.
The separatist Bloc Quebecois has won support among French-speaking
Quebecers, who played a crucial role in sweeping the Conservatives to
victory in the past two elections. In the west, the Reform party has made
inroads with a populist platform of less government, tighter immigration
controls and a retreat from official bilingualism.
The outcome is further clouded by the virtual collapse of the NDP, hobbled
by unpopular New Democrat governments in Ontario and British Columbia.
Recent opinion polls show the Liberals slightly ahead of the Conservatives.
Besides portraying Ms Campbell as a clone of her unpopular predecessor Mr
Brian Mulroney, the Liberals stand to benefit most from the NDP's weakness.
The Tories are putting their faith in polls which show Ms Campbell far ahead
of Liberal leader Mr Jean Chretien in personal popularity.
The main parties have so far focused on economic issues, especially deficit
reduction and job creation.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Clinton targets housing: President's Dollars 600m plan will
help disaster-hit regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m)
scheme to tackle the shortfall in 'affordable' housing, particularly
targeting regions hit hard by natural disasters.
In a Labour Day address in Miami, the US president said federal agencies
would guarantee the financing, which will be provided by a labour pension
investment fund. Areas such as Florida, struck by Hurricane Andrew last
year, and the flood-swept Midwest will receive a significant proportion of
the funding.
Mr Clinton stressed private sector-government co-operation and cited, as an
example, the housing investment trust fund proposed by the AFL-CIO, the
umbrella organisation of most US unions.
'This is the kind of thing we should be doing,' he said. 'The government can
guarantee the security of the pension funds, the unions can put up those
pension funds to invest in houses, the Labour Department can help provide
funds to train people.'
The government guarantee agencies - the Federal National Mortgage
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation - have been
moving into areas abandoned by the budget-squeezed Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD). HUD, however, has been working with the agencies
and labour to employ pension funds for job-creating projects.
Announcement of the initiative came shortly after the president vowed to do
'anything I can' to stimulate a US economy plagued by current and future job
losses in both private and public sectors. Mr Clinton was responding to a
report in the New York Times that his administration was considering
short-term stimulative measures similar to those taken by President George
Bush in 1992.
A Dollars 17bn job-creating package introduced by Mr Clinton early this year
was killed by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. According to the Times,
administration officials are now considering measures which do not require
congressional approval, including delays in tax collection, a speed-up of
government spending, and an easing of rules governing the airline industry
and bank lending.
Mr Clinton's autumn agenda is typically ambitious - healthcare reform,
passage of the North America Free Trade Agreement, an anti-crime measure,
and Vice-President Al Gore's government restructuring plan, due to be
unveiled today. However, the administration's focus on the economy is a
recognition that nothing will boost its fortunes so much as a strengthened
recovery.
The president must reckon with Congress's continuing appetite for budget
reduction measures, going beyond the cuts in the Dollars 500bn budget plan
narrowly approved last month.
Some officials would like to direct stimulative spending towards California,
the New York Times said. Unemployment in the state is now 9 per cent, thanks
largely to job cuts in defence-related industries.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, has already begun to approve assistance to
California, where the president's popularity has been sinking. Late last
month he announced Dollars 10.7m in grants for California, the first in a
number of planned moves to speed defence re-conversion and revitalise the
state's economy.

FT  07 SEP 93 / No easing of general's grip in 'free' Chile: The coming 20th
anniversary of Pinochet's coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a little copper coin in Chile, the 10 peso piece, which depicts the
angel of liberty snapping the chains of repression that for so long have
bound her wrists. It does not commemorate Chile's return to democracy in
1990, after 17 years of military rule, but the coup of 1973 that brought the
generals, led by Augusto Pinochet, to power.
As Chile approaches the 20th anniversary of the coup of September 11, the
coin remains a small but significant reminder of the fragile balance that
exists between the civilian government and the military forces. The
authority of the transitional administration, led by President Patricio
Aylwin, is still strictly circumscribed by the armed forces and by Gen
Pinochet's 1980 constitution which remains largely intact.
Relations with the military, alternately civil and strained during the
democratic transition, have become tense over the past few months. The low
point was May 28 when the military took advantage of President Aylwin's
absence abroad to put on a show of strength on Santiago's streets. Troops
appeared in full combat gear, sporting automatic weapons and rocket
launchers, as the generals - still headed by Gen Pinochet - held a meeting.
The sabre-rattling of May was largely provoked by the one issue that has
dogged civilian-military relations since the 1990 handover - the matter of
human rights abuses committed during the military regime. Most leaders of
the armed forces believe that the issue has dragged on for too long. Many
still argue that during the 1970s the military was engaged in a legitimate
war against Marxism, and that their actions should not be criticised.
Furthermore, since few, if any, torturers and assassins are to be punished -
because of an amnesty promulgated in 1978 - most in the military feel that
to pursue trials is a waste of time which can only further sully the armed
forces' reputation.
President Aylwin's recent attempt to bring the trials to a conclusion ended
in disaster last week when divisions within the governing Concertacion
coalition killed off the president's bill. The so-called 'Aylwin Law',
presented to the nation in an emotional speech last month, had sought to
appoint special judges to hear human rights trials in secret. The hope was
largely to unearth fresh information that might have led to the discovery of
bodies 'disappeared' by the military.
The president was last week forced to halt the bill's progress through
Congress after parties within his own coalition voted against the secret
clause which they argued denied the nation its right to know. It seems clear
that, during months of discussions with Gen Pinochet, the president had
reached agreement with the military, but had not squared the deal within his
own government.
His retreat, seen in Santiago as a personal political defeat, shows the
difficulty of trying to appease politicians and soldiers when they are
pulling in different directions.
The bickering within the Concertacion mirrors the no less public debate over
commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the 1973 coup, still a public
holiday after the government's failed attempt to shift it to a less
controversial day. The failure to do so in itself highlights the
restrictions imposed by the 1980 constitution which, among other things,
enabled Gen Pinochet to stack the Senate with nine of his non-elected
supporters.
The Concertacion has insisted that the military not conduct its celebrations
within four blocks of the Moneda presidential palace, the building which was
bombed during the final stages of the 1973 coup that overthrew the left-wing
government of President Salvador Allende.
Mr Aylwin has called on the armed forces to show restraint and to remember
the families of those who suffered repression. He has also urged Chileans
not to organise demonstrations in favour of or against the coup, but instead
to strive for reconciliation.
Traditionally, government employees have demonstrated their disapproval of
the holiday by refusing to take the day off work. But this method of protest
has been denied them this year since September 11 falls on a Saturday. The
possibility of clashes between opponents and supporters of the coup remains,
in spite of the president's attempt to defuse matters.
Gen Pinochet feels the nation has forgotten what he sees as the service
performed by the military in overthrowing Mr Allende's Marxist government.
'Everybody in this country has forgotten,' he said in a recent speech. 'It
is as though a shadow of amnesia has passed over the minds of the people.'
He remains a combative defender of the new role carved out for the armed
forces under what has been called a 'protected democracy'. He cannot be
dismissed by the government and is guaranteed to remain commander in chief
until 1998. The president also has no power to reduce the huge armed forces
budget which is inflation-proofed and supplemented by 10 per cent of the
state copper company's earnings.
Mr Eduardo Frei, the presidential candidate of the Concertacion almost
certain to win December's general election, has pledged to tackle what he
regards as the military's excessive power. After the armed forces' recent
flexing of muscles, it seems his task will be far from easy.

MEXICO has announced record levels of international reserves, which should
further ease perennial worries of a currency devaluation and give the
government more scope to boost the sluggish economy without fuelling
inflation.
The Banco de Mexico announced on Sunday that international reserves grew to
Dollars 22.6bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end August, a Dollars 4.03bn increase
from the end of last year. The trade ledger is also looking better,
officials said. For the first half of the year, the current account deficit
stood at Dollars 10bn, 4 per cent less than at the same time last year,
while the capital accounts to finance the deficit jumped to Dollars 14bn.
'The strength of the Mexican economy gives the government a lot of room to
manoeuvre,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, of Baring Securities.
A tight grip on money under President Carlos Salinas has slowed inflation to
8 per cent a year and created a budget surplus of more than Dollars 4bn
dollars for the first half of the year. But it has also choked the economy:
manufacturing stagnated at 0.3 per cent annual growth for the first half of
the year, according to official figures. Economists are expecting tepid
year-end growth of 1.5 per cent.
Higher growth ahead of next July's presidential elections is widely seen as
politically desirable for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party.
Addressing a banker's conference on Sunday, Mr Salinas said his government
would run a balanced budget for the rest of this year, boosting spending by
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn.
There are also signs the government will use an extra Dollars 8bn, including
proceeds from recent media privatisations, to finance a highway project in
the south.
The government will keep interest rates at current nominal levels of 13.5
per cent, down from more than 17 per cent in January, economists believe.
Officials might also give in to business demands for lower corporate tax
rates.
Observers are forecasting robust growth rates of 3.5 per cent next year.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Gaullist tension on presidency mounts

<TEXT>
THE UNEASY jostling over who will carry Gaullist colours into France's 1995
presidential election looks set to increase after a weekend rally confirmed
Mr Jacques Chirac's strength within the party, as distinct from an
electorate increasingly seduced by his prime ministerial protege, Mr Edouard
Balladur.
At a Strasbourg rally of young Gaullists marking the start of the political
year, Mr Chirac paid loyal tribute to Mr Balladur, for 'governing France
well' over the past five months, and pledged 'unfailing and unreserved
support' to his 'friend of 30 years'.
But Mr Chirac made clear that he has not presided over the Gaullist RPR
party for nearly 20 years just to act as king-maker for someone else. Other
speakers, particularly those outside the Balladur government, stressed their
undimmed desire to see Mr Chirac in the Elysee.
Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the national assembly, hailed Mr Chirac as
the chief architect of the conservatives' success. Only Mr Chirac's
'personal charisma' could carry the presidential election, Mr Seguin
suggested.
This hardly concurs with last week's Louis Harris poll that some two thirds
of French thought Mr Balladur had a better chance of winning in 1995, and
would make a better president, than Mr Chirac. But it may move Mr Chirac
towards Mr Seguin and the latter's scepticism about the Maastricht treaty
and criticism of the government's financial orthodoxy at the expense of
employment - a direction in which the Gaullist party leader would probably
like to move anyway.
So far, Mr Balladur, whose standing may well dip if economic recovery is
slow, has resisted any temptation from the polls to declare an interest in
the Elysee. But if he does so, France's fractious conservatives still have
not organised a way of fielding a single presidential candidate. Two years
ago, in opposition, the RPR and the centre-right UDF formally promised to do
this by means of a US-style presidential primary election. Now, in the
comfort of power, they have taken no action to make this a reality.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Kohl plea for investment in east: W German industry wants
special regime for eastern goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN industry yesterday called for special treatment for east German
goods in response to a call by Chancellor Helmut Kohl for investment to be
stepped up in the east of the country as a means of countering the collapse
of the economy there.
Mr Kohl made his appeal at a meeting in the Chancellery with industry and
unions. He and government officials are increasingly concerned about rising
unemployment in the five eastern Lander. The rate is 15 per cent of the
8m-strong labour force, but when job creation schemes, short-term work, and
retraining programmes are taken into account, the figure exceeds 35 per
cent.
The restructuring process 'could not be left solely to the free play of
market forces', Mr Kohl said, calling on western industry to invest more in
the east to stem the fall in manufacturing and induce growth. He singled out
how investments in construction, services and crafts in small workshops were
already contributing to the slight growth in gross domestic product.
These three sectors are largely fuelling GDP which is forecast to grow by
about 6 per cent this year - albeit from a very low base following a 30 per
cent decline in 1991. They are mainly focused on the local market in eastern
Germany, rather than exports.
At yesterday's meeting the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said higher
investment should be coupled with a system granting preferential treatment,
including tax benefits, for east German products in order to make them 'good
value'. West German industry has so far placed DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn) worth
of orders in the east over the past two years. Last week the BDI said it
would increase its purchases from the eastern states to DM25bn a year by
1995.
The need to create local pockets of industry in eastern Germany stems not
only from high unemployment. It reflects a tacit admission by west German
industry, unions and government officials that the entire structure of wage
agreements there has priced the region out of the market.
Wages in most sectors are now 80 per cent of west German levels, but
productivity, particularly in steel, engineering and mining, are about 70
per cent below levels in the west.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Brussels to side-step UK on works councils issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday served notice that as soon as the
Maastricht treaty has been ratified it will side-step the resistance of the
British government and push ahead with the directive on establishing works
councils for consulting employees in large companies.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social and employment affairs commissioner, said yesterday
in an address to the British Trades Union Congress conference in Brighton
that all Community countries except Britain had agreed to start implementing
the directive, which will affect about 700 larger companies in Europe.
Britain will not be directly affected, as it has opted out of the Maastricht
treaty social chapter, but about 100 UK multinationals will be drawn in
through their European subsidiaries. Assuming that the Maastricht treaty is
ratified in November, the works council legislation could become law, after
a period of consultation, within six months.
Mr Flynn said he regretted the British 'opt-out' from the social chapter and
hoped that the UK would rejoin the other 11 before 'too huge a chasm' has
built up on social legislation.
But he also confirmed that the Commission last week agreed an 'opinion' on
equitable wages, which has no legislative force but underlines the
philosophical difference between the UK government, which has been
abol-ishing minimum wage legislation, and the European Commission. Mr Flynn
also lent his backing to the idea of a world social charter.
In his address to the TUC, Mr Flynn stressed that a new balance 'between
regulation and adaptability' was required to help create a 'more
employment-intensive pattern of production'.
Calling for a 'new social pact' to beat unemployment, he pleased his TUC
audience by stressing that wage competition with countries of the Pacific
Rim was not a sensible strategy but he also said that everyone would have to
'give up many cherished preconceptions'.
He suggested, in particular, reform of tax regimes to help job creation and
further reductions and changes in working time, 'bearing in mind that work
sharing implies income sharing'.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Half-win awaits Brundtland: Why Norway's PM views election
with ambivalence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, seems certain to lead
her Labour party to victory in the country's general election next Monday.
But she is deriving little cheer from that.
For the election is likely to make her struggle to bring Norway into the
European Community all the more difficult as anti-EC parties look set to
boost their parliamentary representation.
An electorate ever-resistant to the prospect of EC membership will see to
that. And to make matters worse, she will not have support on Europe from
the party with which she has formed an alliance.
What this all means is that Mrs Brundtland and her party colleagues are
going around campaigning for re-election with one of their most important
policy issues virtually unmentionable.
Judging from the polls, Labour is widely expected to retain 63 seats in the
165-seat parliament, while the Socialist Left (SV) party is set to increase
its parliamentary mandate to 22 seats from 17.
The majority that this would give the alliance may result in a shift to the
left in current policy, with higher taxes and higher public expenditure in
prospect. However, the deep division between them on Europe is likely to
rule out a coalition government.
According to the polls, the agrarian anti-EC Centre party is expected to
boost its representation to 17 seats from 11, while the main opposition
Conservative party will lose two seats to end up with 37 after what analysts
describe as a 'faceless' campaign. The right-wing Progress party looks set
to see its 22 parliamentary seats shrink to 12.
For Labour the result is widely expected to be the same as it was in the
1989 election - around 34 per cent of the vote, its worst result since 1930.
In 1989, Labour was forced to make way for a centre-right coalition
government, when it became clear that the bloc of 80 parliamentary seats, 63
of which were won by Labour and 17 by the SV, was not enough to outweigh the
five non-socialist parties which won 84 seats.
A centre-right tripartite coalition formed a government which fell quickly
on the Europe issue. Labour stepped in to pick up the pieces at the height
of Norway's worst post-war economic crisis.
As Mrs Brundtland trudged around northern Norway at the weekend, her message
to the electorate - that a vote for Labour did not mean a vote for EC
membership - for the most part fell on deaf ears.
'If we do not achieve a result which the government can recommend to the
Norwegian people, we do not have a result that we can go out and fight for,'
she told fishermen in Hammerfest, Europe's northern-most city.
In the high north, where fishing provides the mainstay of household income,
there is decided scepticism about EC membership. The fisherman fear
membership means relinquishing part of their hard-earned fishing quotas to
Europe's fisherman, who, after having depleted their own resources, will
look to Norway to boost their catch.
However, a feeling is emerging that if Norway can conclude an acceptable
negotiating result on fish with Brussels, allowing free market access and
unchanged quotas, then membership could be tolerated.
The reason is that membership might have the effect of boosting Norway's
exports to the Community of processed fish and fish products.
During the election campaign Mrs Brundtland has adamantly refused to debate
the EC question, insisting it is not an EC election and that the issue will
be decided in a referendum to be held in 1994 or 1995.
'Many people are sceptical and many are negative about Norwegian membership.
Despite this there is broad agreement about the Labour Party's and the
government's strategy; that it was right of us to seek membership, that we
must negotiate and that we must achieve a result which the people can vote
on in a referendum,' she said.

THE head of Germany's union federation, Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, is
threatening strikes if parliament agrees to cut paid sick leave to finance a
new healthcare scheme, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. He also threatened
to sue the government in the constitutional court, claiming the cut breached
wage agreements.
Yesterday's threat has come as parliament considers a bill providing for six
unpaid sick days a year, to offset extra social insurance charges on
employers. The extra charges, also paid by employees, would finance a
statutory healthcare scheme for the old and chronically sick. Both unions
and employers' associations have strongly opposed the scheme.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Veba to increase planned cuts in jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEBA, one of Germany's largest industrial groups, is stepping up its already
extensive programme of job cuts in response to the crisis in the European
chemicals industry.
The Dusseldorf-based group, active in energy, chemicals and transport, said
yesterday that it planned to cut a further 3,500 jobs by the end of next
year, bringing the total to 10,000, about 10 per cent of the workforce.
Veba, which recently reported half-year pre-tax profits down by 12 per cent
to DM782m (Pounds 313m), said it had been suffering considerable losses in
the plastics, rubber and petrochemicals sector from the second half of last
year. It blamed the domestic economy, combined with severe price pressure
caused by a flood of cheap imports from east Europe, for the industry's
problems.
There was no option but extensive rationalisation, including job cuts, to
reduce the cost base, Veba said. Together with other steps, the latest
planned job losses would save DM1.2bn a year.
Some 3,000 of the extra job reductions will fall on the Huls subsidiary,
which makes polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC, taking the total losses
there to 8,000, 20 per cent of the workforce. Another 500 will be shed from
Veba Oel: the bulk of the cuts will be achieved through early retirement and
other voluntary schemes.
The dire state of the German chemicals industry has been underscored
recently by last month's appalling results from the big three chemicals
concerns. Profits at BASF fell by 51 per cent in the second quarter of the
year, and Hoechst reported a 31 per cent drop in first half earnings. Bayer
predicted a 20 per cent fall in full year earnings. The industry has been
hit by low demand, oversupply and falling prices.

<TEXT>
HOPES that 1994 will be a year of recovery for the troubled French economy
were strengthened yesterday by confirmation from the government that it
expects growth of 1.4 per cent in gross domestic product next year.
The Economy Ministry, which is finalising plans for the 1994 budget due to
be completed by September 22, is sticking to the growth forecast it made in
June. However, this 1.4 per cent figure conceals changes in the underlying
state of the economy.
Consumer expenditure is expected to rise more slowly than initially forecast
because the recent reductions in interest rates have been too slight to
restore consumer confidence. By contrast, the ministry has upgraded its
forecast for exports to 3.2 per cent growth due to the recent fall in the
value of the French franc.
The ministry's cautious confidence was reinforced by the publication of a
small business survey by La Tribune, the economic newspaper, which showed
that France's small and medium-sized companies, which have borne the brunt
of the recession, are less pessimistic about the economic out-look.
More than half of the companies surveyed believed that the economic
situation had stabilised, against just 5 per cent in a previous study made
in April. Only 42 per cent said that the climate had worsened, compared with
81 per cent in April.
Meanwhile, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday agreed to link
a possible reduction in overall working hours more closely with provisions
to make labour patterns more flexible, in order to make the government's
proposed five-year employment programme more palatable to the unions.
The draft law will go to parliament later this month.
At the end of a nine-hour meeting with unions and employers yesterday, Mr
Balladur stressed his desire for the two sides of industry 'to negotiate
wherever possible, rather than to have rules imposed on them'.

<TEXT>
CROATIAN President Franjo Tudjman yesterday appeared to damp hopes of a
rapid resumption of the Bosnian peace talks when he said he was not prepared
to make any further concessions to the Moslems' territorial demands.
Speaking in Zagreb, five days after the breakdown of the talks in Geneva, Mr
Tudjman insisted he would not hand over the Adriatic port of Neum to the
Bosnian government.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, who yesterday met United Nations
officials in New York, has repeatedly insisted that peace talks cannot
restart unless the Croats guarantee the Moslems access to the Adriatic.
Mr Tudjman's statement came amid signs that US officials were seeking to
step up the pressure on both the Serbs and Croats to make fresh territorial
concessions.
In an apparent attempt to force Serb leaders to be more flexible, the west
has moved to stop sanctions busting along Serbia's southern border, it
emerged yesterday.
The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, apparently prompted by the US,
announced that it had stopped illegal commercial traffic between the two
states.
Meanwhile, as Moslem and Croat forces continued to jostle for land in
central Bosnia, UN officials warned that another humanitarian crisis was
developing in the central Bosnian town of Jablanica.
In the last week up to 10,000 Moslem refugees had arrived in the small
mountain town, which has been cut off from aid convoys by fighting between
Moslem and Croat forces, according to Mr Ray Wilkinson, a UN spokesman in
Sarajevo.
The majority of the refugees appeared to be victims of Croat 'ethnic
cleansing', although 450 men had also apparently come from Croat detention
camps, Mr Wilkinson said.

FOURTEEN wounded patients were evacuated from a makeshift hospital in the
besieged Moslem quarter of Mostar yesterday as part of a reciprocal
agreement between Moslem and Croat military leaders, Reuter reports from
Mostar.
Spanish peacekeeping troops took the 14, mostly soldiers but including one
injured woman and a child, to the nearby town of Medjugorje. The evacuation
had been delayed since Saturday.
From there, they set off by Bosnian army helicopter to the Moslem-held town
of Zenica.
Nato fighter aircraft flew over the Medjugorje area before and during the
airlift, dropping flares to discourage attacks.
During an airlift of Croat wounded from Nova Bila hospital in central Bosnia
last week, a helicopter pilot said his aircraft had been fired on by
Moslems. His claim could not be independently verified.

THE main western states have given up hope that economic reform in Russia
can be carried through in the near future, and further assistance is now
unlikely to be offered this year, according to foreign diplomats and
officials in Moscow.
A mission from the International Monetary Fund is due in Moscow later this
month to review progress on the reform programme - but is likely to confirm
its view, already made known to the Russian leadership, that payment of the
next Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) tranche of its transformation facility, or
any other payments, cannot be made this year.
Besides the Dollars 1.5bn, the World Bank has ceased negotiations on a
Dollars 600m rehabilitation loan - designed to support the budget - because
of the deterioration of the reform programme. However, a Dollars 610m loan
to the oil industry, signed in Moscow a month ago, will go through.
At the same time, the Russian government is convulsed by a debate about
economic policy, as two rival conceptions of reform battle for the approval
of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy
prime minister, has privately presented a document to Mr Yeltsin calling for
a greatly loosened macro-economic policy. It argues that the tight policy
pursued by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, has both forced down
production and pushed up inflation.
'Such a course only discredits the policy of reform,' he says, urging
increased investment in key industries and an end to the system of
privatisation by vouchers.
Mr Fyodorov has pushed through a strategy which would restore a 7 per cent
cut in VAT, levy new excise taxes on imported goods, put up local sales
taxes, cut the indexation of wages and reduce the price which the state pays
for grain. These measures are expected to bring in Rbs5-6,000bn - but
involve a direct contradiction of decisions taken by parliament.
The west's financiers would find it hard to support policy which has not
been subjected to a parliamentary vote.
While Mr Fyodorov's policy has been approved 'in principle' by the
government, the line of argument being pushed by Mr Lobov - a close friend
of Mr Yeltsin's, who outranks Mr Fyodorov in the government - is attracting
more support.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Azeris may join CIS and improve chances of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chances of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict improved yesterday
after talks between Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Gaidar
Aliyev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan.
Speaking after meeting Mr Yeltsin, Mr Aliyev said that the 'self-imposed
isolation' visited on Azerbaijan by the previous government of Mr Abulfaz
Elcibey was now over - and that he may apply for membership of the
Commonwealth of Independent States at its next summit meeting on September
24 in Moscow.
On Nagorno-Karabakh, Mr Aliyev said that the problem was 'not that of
Azerbaijan's alone, but of the entire Caucasus. The Russian Federation
cannot remain indifferent to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.'
Membership of the CIS would bring Azerbaijan into closer contact with
Armenia, a member since its inception - while Mr Aliyev's comments on
Russia's interest in the Caucasian conflicts clearly marks out a role for
Russia as mediator and peace-maker.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister, is to visit Moscow tomorrow,
for talks on the conflict - which has seen Armenian forces take the
south-western part of Azerbaijan up to the Iranian border, with floods of
refugees crossing the frontier. Mr Aliyev is expected to remain in Moscow to
meet Mrs Ciller.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Yeltsin's generals fear leading phantom army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin made the remarkable promise, while visiting
army units in the Moscow region last week, that he would spend one day a
month 'working with the military'. It was a promise born of necessity, and
of fear.
The Russian military faces a series of structural crises which any armed
force would find agonising to absorb. It is suffering a dramatic loss of
prestige and power: plunging recruitment; wars on and within new frontiers;
a worsening housing shortage; rock-bottom pay; the absence of any military
doctrine; an inability to train because of lack of fuel, ammunition and
equipment; disintegrating discipline; attacks on its property and threats to
the bases it still tries to hold from the Baltics to Baikanur.
It is a tribute to the officer corps, and to the stolidity of the Russian
recruits, that this army has remained quiescent, with Colonel Stanislav
Terekhov's national-communist Union of Officers still apparently a minority
cause. But can it take much more without becoming dangerous?
Mr Yeltsin, and Marshal Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, heard these
grumbles when they toured the elite Taman division (whose soldiers defended
Mr Yeltsin's parliament during the August 1991 coup). Mr Yeltsin spoke about
difficult times not spoiling the capacity of the Russian army to respond to
any and all challenges, but it was no more than words.
An army which numbered 4m five years ago is now estimated by General Dmitri
Volkogonnov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, at about 1.8 - and falling fast.
New regulations for the draft exempt the majority of young men - allowing
the army to take a mere 300,000 this year. Of the spring draft, only 13 per
cent had reported.
At its present rate of decline, the army will be below a target strength of
1.5m well before the set date of January 1995. Since the reduction will be
an unplanned one, largely among the ranks of conscripts, it will be an army
mainly composed of generals, officers and sergeants.
The option of using 'contract' soldiers, the harbingers of the professional
army which is an official aim, cannot fill the gap in spite of monthly pay
of Rbs60,000 - 10 times more than a conscript's earnings. Only a little over
100,000 have signed up this year for all the armed services.
The lack of interest is hardly surprising given that, in June, there was no
pay at all for the army and, in some bases, electricity and gas were cut
off.
In addition to the vast demobilisation, and withdrawal from former
satellites, the armed forces must adjust to a world at once less and more
threatening than that in which they flourished.
They have lost a great enemy to their west and found little ones everywhere
else, but especially to the south. The North Caucasus - where an arc of
ethnically-mixed autonomous states within Russia stretch across the borders
of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - are in armed ferment.
Increasingly, too, Russian forces are being drawn into conflicts in former
Soviet republics, including Tajikistan, Georgia - and Moldova, around the
River Dnestr, where they are protecting the interests of Russian speakers.
From out of this dramatically swift re-ordering of its character and its
duties, the Russian military could hardly be expected to produce a new
doctrine - though one is promised. Mr Yeltsin said last week that he wanted
it later this year.
The general staff talks of a smaller army - but a more professional, more
efficient, better equipped force. For the moment, however, they must strive
to prevent disintegration - and the politicisation of a traditionally
apolitical force.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Geevor to bid for shut British Coal pits after rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEVOR, Britain's oldest UK mining company, is being brought back from the
brink of death by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British
Coal, in a move which provides hope of re-employment for hundreds of miners
made redundant in the government's pit closures programme.
Mr Edwards plans to become chairman of Geevor following a financial
restructuring.
This will involve a rights issue, the acquisition of a Welsh pit formerly
mined by British Coal and the conversion of Geevor's debt into equity.
Geevor will acquire one of Mr Edward's private businesses, Coal Investments,
which has made bids to take over five pits closed by British Coal - Betws in
Wales, Trentham in Staffordshire, Markham Main and Rossington in Yorkshire
and Coventry.
Although there is no prospect of Geevor re-employing anything like the
numbers made redundant at the mines last year and this, it may be able to
provide work for several hundred.
Mr Edwards said yesterday that if any of his bids for the bigger mines was
successful, he would hope to produce around 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes a year
from each, compared with potential capacity of more than 1m tonnes.
Holders of Geevor's equity and debt have given broad support to the
proposals, according to Mr Christopher Stainforth, an executive at merchant
bank Guinness Mahon, which is advising Mr Edwards.
Geevor shares have been suspended for 18 months but should resume trading in
mid-October. Details of the deal are likely to be announced next week.
Geevor has been struggling for survival since it withdrew from Cornish tin
mining in 1990. Mr Edwards plans to drop the Geevor name and replace it with
that of Coal Investments.
The restructuring involves Geevor buying a small, privately mined pit in
Cwmguili, Wales. There will also be a rights issue to raise Pounds 1.75m, to
help develop both Cwmguili and any mines whose licence Geevor acquires.
However, if it is successful with more than one British Coal bid, it is
likely to return to the market for additional funds.
Following the rights issue, Geevor will be capitalised at about Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Edwards will own about 3 per cent.

FT  07 SEP 93 / British Gas demands curbs on regulator: Sir James McKinnon
accused of high-handedness and manipulating media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has called for radical measures to curb the powers of Sir James
McKinnon, the industry's regulator. It accused him of deliberately stoking
up acrimony between the two organisations by being high-handed and
manipulating the media.
In a wide-ranging attack on Ofgas and its director-general, British Gas
complained in strong, often bitter terms, about its treatment at the hands
of Ofgas and Sir James when giving evidence to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission's recent investigation of the gas market.
The MMC's full report was published yesterday following the release of its
main recommendations last month. These called for the break-up of British
Gas by 1997, followed by the abolition of the monopoly in the tariff market
for small customers.
The comments about Ofgas and Sir James, in which British Gas seemed to be
venting its frustrations, went much further than earlier clashes in the long
battle between company and regulator.
Last night, Sir James declined to comment on the criticisms and proposals.
British Gas portrayed Ofgas as an organisation out to manipulate the media,
and intent on personalising the conflict so that it could be portrayed as
'David versus Goliath'. In particular, it said that Ofgas:
started from a position that any proposal from British Gas would be
unsatisfactory;
exploited the media, putting out press releases that were inaccurate and
emotional in tone;
was reluctant to acknowledge any good performance;
distorted the results of face-to-face meetings in correspondence, placing
the worst possible interpretation on any position taken by British Gas.
The submission to the MMC included an attack on Sir James who, it said,
'frequently threatened the unnecessary use' of his powers in order to
achieve his objectives. Altogether, Ofgas's behaviour made the relationship
far worse than it need have been, British Gas said, and this affected the
attitudes of investors and lenders to the company.
British Gas said that the role of Ofgas should be limited to regulating
monopoly activities, and that wider questions of competition in the gas
business should be removed from its aegis. It proposed measures for
utilities regulators similar to the Cadbury Committee proposals on corporate
governance.
These included that Ofgas should publish, with its reasons, the basis for
any proposed enforcement decision; that there should be an adequate appeals
process to deal with disputes between the regulator and utility; and that
regulatory power should be vested in a gas commission rather than the
director-general, who had 'excessive discretion'.
In its report, the MMC said it believed that the regulatory system was
fundamentally sound.
The 1,000-page report also revealed that the Department of Trade and
Industry, which must decide the future of British Gas, is wary of proceeding
too fast with radical changes.
In a submission to the MMC, officials in the DTI's oil and gas division said
that breaking up British Gas and abolishing the monopoly in the tariff
market for small customers were 'complex' exercises for which there were no
precedents in other countries.
The DTI said last night that no decisions had been taken about the report.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is seeking comments
by the end of next month.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Israel and Arab states to meet on aid: Rabin envoy says
peace could lead to independent Palestine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL and its Arab neighbours are this month to discuss setting up a
central fund to channel hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid
money to the Middle East.
Officials from Middle Eastern protagonists including Israel, Jordan, Egypt,
the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Gulf states are to meet at the
World Bank in Washington on September 20 to discuss a detailed plan for
regional economic and infrastructural development.
It comes as the peace diplomacy in the region continues to gather pace. Mr
Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the US, said yesterday an accord
with the PLO could lead to an independent Palestinian state.
The Washington meeting will examine reports produced by the World Bank on
regional development and on development in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where it has already estimated there is a need for a Dollars 4.3bn
(Pounds 2.8bn) development programme over 10 years.
Preliminary talks will be held on the possible establishment of a 'Middle
East fund' which would oversee and set priorities for development projects
together with the donor countries, according to Mr Oded Eran, a senior
official at the foreign ministry in Jerusalem. He said yesterday that this
clearing house might operate under the auspices of the World Bank, though
donors might prefer to give aid bilaterally and project-by-project.
The prospect of a fund bringing together Arab oil money and western
assistance to finance a programme for improving the quality of life in the
occupied territories and for regional economic integration has been often
spoken of in the past by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, who
initialled an historic peace deal with the PLO in Oslo 10 days ago.
But the quickening tempo of peace moves - with the Gulf states yesterday
proclaiming their support for the Israeli-PLO deal on Palestinian self-rule,
and Israel under Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government apparently on the brink of
mutual recognition with the PLO - suggests such a plan may be moving closer
to reality. The US administration is already trying to muster Dollars 590m
from Arab states and others to finance the transition from Israeli military
occupation to Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza.
These plans would open up the prospect of lucrative contracts for European
and other companies. Several European countries have been signed up as
'shepherds' to conduct project studies in particular sectors: Britain in
financial services and banking systems; Germany in the dismantling of
regional trade barriers; Spain in agriculture; and Italy in waste disposal
and ground water. Outside the EC, Japan has also agreed to lead a study of
the huge potential for tourism in the Middle East.
The French government is working on a feasibility study on regional
transport which, if implemented, could involve road and rail-building
projects linking countries which have been in a state of war for 45 years. A
team from the French commerce ministry is in Israel this week studying the
possibility of a road between Alexandria in Egypt, Israel, Syria and Turkey,
which would enable trucks to carry goods overland from the Middle East to
Europe.
'Projects that once seemed utopian now seem realistic and increasingly
feasible,' said Mr Dan Gillerman, chairman of the Israeli Chamber of
Commerce, who has been discussing potential projects with European and US
companies and with an array of leading Arab businessmen. Mr Gillerman said
he expected total investment in the region from foreign aid and business
capital to exceed Dollars 5bn in the first five years of peace.

FT  07 SEP 93 / Renault and Volvo agree to merge vehicle operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT and Volvo are to merge their automotive operations to create
Europe's second largest vehicle maker and one of the world's 20 biggest
industrial groups, the companies announced yesterday.
The merger is one of the most significant steps in the restructuring of the
world auto industry and is aimed at strengthening the two companies in the
face of depressed markets and growing competition.
The deal, which will take effect from the beginning of next year, will also
clear the way for the sale of the French government's controlling stake in
Renault as part of its ambitious privatisation programme to be launched this
autumn.
The French state will initially hold, directly and indirectly, 65 per cent
of the newly formed Renault-Volvo Automotive, with Volvo holding the
remaining 35 per cent. The merger will include all of Renault, but only
Volvo's automotive operations. It will exclude the Swedish group's marine,
aero-engine and food interests.
France will have an upper hand in the management of the group. Mr Louis
Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, will be chief executive and chairman of the
management board of Renault-Volvo Automotive in charge of the day-to-day
operations of the group.
But the Swedish company will retain a powerful influence through the
adoption of a German-style supervisory board which will be chaired by Mr
Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman.
The decision to move from the existing alliance to a full-scale merger has
been accelerated by the decline in the European car market, which is set to
contract by about 16 per cent this year. The two companies say they will
achieve substantial economies through the merger by sharing costs across a
larger production volume.
But both companies stressed that the identities of their cars and trucks
would remain distinct.
Both Mr Gyllenhammar and Mr Schweitzer expressed confidence that the two
companies could be merged smoothly. They said they were aware of the dangers
and difficulties involved in merging two large industrial groups but that
the experience of their three-year alliance would facilitate co-operation.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said that the merger and
the privatisation of Renault would make it easier to raise capital. He said
he hoped the sale of the government's stake in Renault could be achieved
from the second half of 1994, depending on conditions in the car market and
the performance of the merged company.
The structure of the merger means that the French government along with
Volvo should retain control of the group even after the sale of the state
holding in Renault. A financial holding company, owned 51 per cent by the
French government and 49 per cent by Volvo, will hold a 35 per cent share in
Renault-Volvo Automotive. The French stake in this holding company is
expected to form the basis for a core of long-term French investors.
Reaction in Sweden to the long-awaited merger ranged from angry denunciation
in a popular newspaper to strong support from prime minister Carl Bildt's
centre-right government.
Market reaction was subdued as the deal had largely been discounted. Volvo's
B share fell SKr7 to close at SKr483.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Multiplication the Transylvanian way: Virginia Marsh finds a
popular Romanian scheme to make money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
have sunk cash
into a pyramid money-multiplying scheme at the Transylvanian town of
Cluj.
The scheme is known as Caritas, although it has no connection with the
international charity of the same name. It takes deposits, with a promise to
pay back eight times the amount in three months.
Tales of 'Caritas millionaires' have spread around Romania, encouraging
thousands of people to descend on Cluj, in Romania's western province, in
the hope of cashing in and hedging against feverish inflation. The scheme
has produced some lei millionaires - in effect, worth over a thousand
dollars.
While most Romanians grapple with soaring prices, declining living standards
and meagre pay, investors deposit a minimum of Lei20,000 (Pounds 15.70),
nearly a third of the average monthly wage. Three months later, Caritas,
which has in the meantime collected from new depositors, pays out eight
times the original investment, less a commission. Many people are leaving
their money in the scheme in the hope of bigger gains to come.
No section of Romanian society appears immune to the lure. Head-scarved
peasant women from the countryside, many clutching bags full of money, wait
their turn in the four-day queue outside the sports hall where Caritas is
based, alongside groups of laughing gypsies. Two young men from Bucharest
furtively count out large bundles of notes. Others, unable to find room in
hotels, sleep in their cars.
All hope it is not too late to benefit from Caritas, even though most say
they know it will eventually collapse like other such schemes, many of which
have sprung up in post-communist Romania and which have various precedents
in other parts of southern Europe.
'Caritas is our only hope of surving the winter,' says a woman who had
travelled 300 kilometres with her elderly father to deposit their monthly
salary and pension in the scheme. 'We can't keep up with the price rises.
Inflation is 260 per cent a year, but we only get 50 per cent interest in
the savings bank.'
The riches Caritas has brought to many in Transylvania have made its
founder, Mr Ioan Stoica, a former bookkeeper, a national hero. He lives
modestly and no-one is able to put a figure on any profits from the scheme.
Others hit by the country's declining economy see Mr Stoica as a Robin Hood
figure. One man says: 'Caritas is an association to give money to the people
and to save them from poverty. I don't know where Stoica gets the money but
he's the only one doing something to help us.'
Caritas has also lifted the popularity of Mr Gheorghe Funar, Cluj's
radically anti-Hungarian mayor and the leader of the Romanian parliament's
largest nationalist party. No formal links between Caritas and the mayor
have been proved but Mr Funar has become its unoffical ambassador.
Diplomats say the scheme looks like a classic money-laundering scam but the
Romanian central government, which since July has been able to levy on
Caritas a new 18 per cent value-added tax, has done little to discourage it.
However, a senior local police officer warned: 'There were near riots in
other towns when similar (schemes) with only a few thousand participants
went bankrupt. I just don't want to think about what will happen here when
we have a whole county and hundreds of thousands of people involved.'

FT  06 SEP 93 / California plans earlier primary ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA plans to hold its presidential primary ballot earlier in the
year, heralding a profound change in the shape of future US elections.
The state senate last week voted for a bill that would move the primary to
March from June, and both the assembly and Governor Pete Wilson are expected
to give their approval this week.
Although by far the most populous state, California has had relatively
little impact on the selection of presidential candidates in recent years,
because its primary has been one of the last to take place, usually after
each party already has a clear winner.
'The truth is California has essentially been left out of the presidential
nominating process since 1972. It's the biggest, most diverse and arguably
the most important state, and it would certainly diminish anything else
happening in March,' said Mr Bill Carrick, a Democratic political strategist
who has worked on both presidential and Californian campaigns.
The March 26 date chosen for 1996 would probably still put California's
primary later than the Super Tuesday cluster of southern states, and later
than Illinois and Michigan, but before several important states such as New
York, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
'Two weeks after Super Tuesday and one week before New York - it'll be big,'
said one California state Republican party official.
Mr Bob Mulholland, of the state Democratic party, believes other states will
follow California's lead and hold their primaries earlier, effectively
compressing the entire nominating process into three months.
'If in 1996 we have a primary season running from February to early April, I
think that's good for everybody, and especially the contributors,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADS of two German car companies at the weekend criticised the public
row between rivals Volkswagen and US-based General Motors over alleged
industrial espionage as being damaging to the industry generally, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of BMW, told Die Welt newspaper: 'There is
much more at stake than a loss of image for the automotive industry.
Industry leaders in general are coming under fire.'
Separately, Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chairman of German luxury sports car
maker Porsche, criticised the public nature of the VW-GM dispute.
'It would be better for the whole of the automotive industry if the dispute
between VW and Opel had remained in internal channels and not been fought in
public,' Mr Wiedeking told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper on Saturday.
GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel have accused Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, VW's production chief, and other former GM managers of taking
confidential documents from the US group when they switched to VW this year.
Mr Lopez and the others deny the charges.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Ukraine deal with Russia under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION is growing to Ukraine's agreement to sell its half of the Black
Sea Fleet, and to return its nuclear warheads, to Russia. Ukraine has
thereby put itself into political crisis.
The agreement, announced by President Leonid Kravchuk and President Boris
Yeltsin after talks on Friday, was denounced over the weekend by a Ukrainian
minister, Mr Valery Shmarov. It was described by a deputy premier as
'nothing short of a disaster' and by Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the
nationalist opposition party, Rukh, as 'high treason'.
Mr Kravchuk himself partly defended, partly denied, his alleged agreement to
the deal. General Konstantin Morozov, defence minister, said yesterday that
no agreement on the sale of the Ukrainian fleet had yet been concluded. Mr
Kravchuk stressed that details of both the sale of the fleet and the
transfer of the warheads had to be worked out by joint commissions.
Mr Yeltsin said after the meeting that the cost of the fleet would be set
against an estimated Dollars 2.5bn which Kiev owes to Moscow for oil and gas
supplies.
The Russian president, in a television interview on Saturday, rubbed the
message home by saying that Ukraine's surrender of her share of the fleet -
agreed to be split last year - was 'forced but inevitable'. The costs, he
said, 'will have to be reckoned up. But we have done our own reckoning
already. We aren't losing by it, and we'll have our own fleet'.
Mr Kravchuk, who has appeared in the past month to switch from a line
generally hostile to Russia to one where he favours closer integration, now
faces the hardest challenge of his political life.
Confronted with 40 per cent inflation, falling production and growing unrest
in the industrial areas - especially in the Donbass coal and steel region -
he must now garner support for a policy of allegiance with Russia, and a
loss of some of the strongly-expressed independence whose spokesman he has
been.

THE evacuation of some 50 wounded Moslems from the south-west Bosnian city
of Mostar was postponed yesterday for the second day running, Bosnian radio
reported, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
The radio reported yesterday evening that a general alert had been called in
Mostar, where it said the besieged Moslem sector on the east bank of the
Neretva river was being attacked by Croatian forces using multiple-rocket
launchers.
Croatian radio said the evacuation from Mostar had been postponed until
today because of weather conditions.
However, a Reuter journalist in Medjugorje, near Mostar, quoted members of
the United Nations Spanish battalion deployed in the area as saying UN
troops were awaiting the arrival of Bosnian helicopters that would fly the
wounded to Moslem-held towns.
The evacuation from Mostar was arranged between Moslems and Croats in
exchange for the airlifting of wounded Croat soldiers and civilians from
Nova Bila in central Bosnia, where fierce fighting is raging between the two
former allies.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Further cuts in Japanese car exports to Europe agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission and Japanese authorities agreed at the weekend to
cut the number of cars entering the European Community from Japan this year
to 980,000 units, a fall of some 17.6 per cent from last year's level.
The deal, which was reached in Tokyo after two days of intense talks, goes
much further than an earlier agreement in April that, given the weakness of
the European car market, Japanese exports to the EC should be reduced by 9.4
per cent to 1.09m units.
The agreement favours the EC car industry at the expense of Japanese makers,
which were hoping to keep the figure above 1m units. Japan was, however,
able to win agreement that the level of Japanese exports could be adjusted
mid-year, not only if EC market conditions deteriorated substantially, but
also if they improved.
The two sides reached an understanding only after a second session of talks
on Friday extended throughout the night to about midday on Saturday.
Exports to the UK are maintained under the new agreement at 202,800 on the
grounds that market conditions are improving there. Exports to France are to
fall to 69,000 from an initially agreed 77,300, while those to Italy are
down to 38,800 from 42,900, Spain to 29,300 from 34,200 and Portugal to
39,000 from 41,500.
Under a monitoring arrangement aimed at gradually opening up the EC market
to Japanese car exports, Japan limits the number of cars it exports to the
EC to a mutually agreed level. This arrangement is due to end with full
liberalisation in 1999.
The agreement in April was based on a forecast by the European Commission
that the EC car market would fall 6.5 per cent this year to 13m units.
However, EC automotive demand fell 18.5 per cent in the first seven months
of the year. The latest agreement is based on mutual recognition that demand
for cars in the EC market will reach some 11.7m units in 1993.
Although the Japanese authorities had recognised the weakness of car demand
in the EC, and were in principle agreed that a reduction would be necessary,
they had at first resisted the EC's request, in part out of fear of setting
an unwanted precedent.
The Japanese car industry, which has been under severe pressure from weak
demand in its home market and fierce competition in the US in the wake of a
higher yen, expressed a mixture of concern and resignation. 'Our basic
stance is that given the weakness of the EC market, it cannot be helped,' a
Toyota official said.
It is unlikely Japanese car exports would have been much greater than the
level agreed at the weekend. Exports to the EC were already down 16 per cent
in the first six months of the year.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Into extra time in Japan - Gary Lineker,
the former England footballer, talks to Charles Leadbeater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man widely regarded as The Greatest Living Englishman hobbled around the
corner. He delivered a melting smile and offered to buy me an orange juice
in the canteen.
'Oranju jusu, futatsu,' he asked in impeccable beginner's Japanese. When the
canteen manager refused to take his yen in payment, he remarked quietly:
'That's nice - free orange juice.'
An international sports superstar, earning thousands of pounds a week as the
best-paid foreign player in the Japanese soccer league's first season, he is
still pleasantly surprised at getting a free orange juice. The answer to my
main question was already becoming clear before I had asked it: Gary Lineker
really is a charming person.
And even limping with a broken toe, and dressed in drab blue jeans and
T-shirt, he manages to look good, horribly good. Tanned and muscular, with
deep brown eyes, slightly greying temples and almost always smiling broadly,
he has become a household name in Japan, even though his bad toe has kept
him out of the game for most of the season.
The 32-year-old striker's first serious injury has been a big frustration.
He has sat on the sidelines as the J-League has taken off, and watching
football has become Japan's most fashionable pastime with crowds of up to
60,000 a game, while his team Nagoya Grampus Eight has fallen towards the
bottom of the league and a clutch of unknown Brazilians has taken their team
to the top of the table.
Yet, for all that, and in spite of Japan's often torrential summer rain, the
move from London's Tottenham Hotspur has reinvigorated the man who came
within one goal of Bobby Charlton's record of 48 goals in an England shirt.
'To be honest, I have been surprised that the standard has been so high.
There are no negative aspects to the game. Everything is so positive,' he
explained.
Lineker's excitement is due not just to the J-League's early popularity. It
is more than that. Japan, a land where formal good manners are the norm, and
Lineker, known as the politest man in British sport, were made for one
another.
The most striking thing about Lineker is how personable and modest he is.
Yet beneath his apparently effortless politeness, he is extremely
controlled. Words are carefully weighed, judgments are measured and rare
criticisms are usually indirect.
Lineker admits to loving football. Yet by the end of his career with Spurs
his motivation for league games was flagging. The move to Japan, where
stadiums are packed to capacity with noisy, flag-waving crowds of mainly
young people, has revived him.
'The crowd are what make it,' he explained. 'Wherever we play the grounds
are sold out and colourful. The greatest thing is that the crowd is not at
all cynical. Because it is all new to them, they think the whole thing is
exciting. Even if you are losing three-nil they still get behind you, and to
be honest I have found that really refreshing. It is much easier to motivate
yourself here.'
The Linekers - wife Michelle, eldest son George (recovering from leukaemia)
and recent arrival Harry - are settling well in industrial Nagoya, three
hours south of Tokyo.
'Culture shock is lots of little things,' reflected Lineker, who also played
in Spain for Barcelona in the mid-1980s. 'We do most of the same things we
did in England: eat out, see friends. Living here has been great, a once in
a lifetime opportunity.'
His travails with Japanese (he speaks Spanish fluently) make his work more
difficult, even though most of the terminology of Japanese soccer -
'shootoh', 'offu sidoh' - is borrowed from English. Language apart, Lineker
said that working for a Japanese company - Grampus Eight is the Toyota works
team - was not much different from working for a British one.
'You have to be very patient and explain things, and accept that sometimes
they will not listen; they do things their way. We train a little longer
than in England but not as intensely. There are far more people in the club
office, but that is one of the ways they keep down unemployment.'
The J-League's success has done more than renew Lineker's enthusiasm. It has
also given him a wider perspective on the shortcomings of the English game.
As England prepares for Wednesday's match against Poland, which could mark
its exit from the World Cup, Lineker has some advice about how the English
game should be restructured to make it more internationally competitive -
although, as usual, the criticism was delivered by implication.
'Here they are prepared to listen to players and managers, which is
certainly something they could learn from in England.'
The explanations for England's demise moved Lineker to the boundaries of his
world of carefully chosen, diplomatic phrases. There were hints of
bitterness about the unhappy end to his own career (he was substituted in
his final game for England) and even a touch of injured pride, if not
self-interest: 'It is hard to see us qualifying (for the World Cup), and
that would be a big blow to the game. Things look pretty bad.
'I just think that we have to bring back the best players who have been
dropped. We have proved beyond doubt now that you cannot compete at
international level unless you play your best 11 players. At that level it
is not about hustling people and winning the ball all day long, you have to
have a bit more than that.'
He would not say that he should still be playing for England, but remarked:
'We showed in the 1990 World Cup that we could compete with the best in the
world. That all seems to have been tossed aside too soon.'
He does not lay all the blame at the door of Graham Taylor, the little-loved
England manager. The root of the English game's troubles were in the way
youngsters learnt to play, Lineker said.
'We will never be as technically gifted as other countries until we change
the size of pitches our kids play on. They play on massive pitches, so they
are taught to boot the ball as far as possible to get it to the other end.
In other countries, Germany and Holland, they deliberately play on smaller
pitches so that they learn how to pass.
'If we banned youth football on big pitches, then we might start competing
internationally with consistency, rather than occasionally.'
The professional game also needed reorganisation, he argued. 'We have to cut
down the amount of football we play, because we just get lots of injuries.
The quality of the game suffers, players are never fresh. In the Italian
league they play fewer games, the players are fresher, quicker, better. We
should get rid of one of the cup competitions and cut the league down to 18
teams.'
Viewed from Japan, the weaknesses of English football are very much the
traditional weaknesses of British industry: a reliance on high-volume,
poorly marketed products of variable quality and limited innovation, which
require players of great strength but only middling skills, exactly the
qualities both the industrial and football training systems are designed to
deliver.
Lineker disavowed any ambitions to return to England as a football manager
after his two-year stint with the Nagoya team. Yet, after his experience of
the J-League success, he could emerge as an eloquent critic of the way the
British game is ensnared by the mediocrity of much of its management. 'It
would be nice to put something back into the game, some of these ideas. But
that is very difficult in England because they do not tend to listen to
players. Maybe it will change one day, but they are not receptive to new
ideas.'

FT  06 SEP 93 / EC's northern exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wrangles between Brussels and the Nordic countries over their applications
to join the European Community are likely to be the subject of a growing
number of newspaper reports in the next few months.
As negotiations get down to the toughest issues - particularly the demand
for special treatment for the Arctic regions - doubts may be raised about
whether agreement can be reached. From the EC point of view, a serious
question remains: do the Nordic countries - Finland, Norway and Sweden -
really want to join the Community?
There is no easy answer. Consider the following example: few harbours in
Europe outside the English channel are as busy with passenger ships as
Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Every day, liners with unlikely names like
Cinderella manoeuvre in and out of the small port, dwarfing the rocky
islands that guard the approaches.
Some head south for Tallinn, plying a fast-growing trade with Estonia. The
biggest and sleekest glide westwards towards Stockholm. Some passengers on
board are genuine travellers, preferring the overnight journey by sea to the
high cost of flying around the Nordic region. But many are simply along for
the cruise.
Finns, Swedes and Norwegians enjoy these Baltic jaunts chiefly because they
can stock up on duty-free booze. Drink on board is a good deal cheaper than
in their state alcohol monopolies.
The EC wants to break these monopolies. If it succeeds, the price of drink
on dry land would fall. But people are not cheering on the EC negotiators.
Rather, the three Nordic governments are resisting such changes because of
the political influence still wielded by their respective temperance
movements.
Perhaps it is not such a paradox. In their different ways, the Finns,
Norwegians and Swedes are proud and jealous of their way of life and the
prosperous, welfare societies they have created against the climatic odds -
even if the recession has put them under severe strain.
For instance, in Norway, fishing ac-counts for only a tiny proportion of
gross domestic product and em-ploys only a small fraction of the workforce.
But fishing and the sea retain an unshakeable place in the national
identity. Fishing makes up, in the memorable metaphor of an adviser to Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, 30 per cent of political GDP. The issue of
EC fishing quotas is, therefore, much more than just a question of fish
stock management and fishermen's income.
Likewise, the argument that food would become cheaper and choice wider if
protection and subsidy for Arctic and sub-Arctic farmers were dismantled,
cuts little ice with a Nordic public that has traditionally been willing to
pay a price for sustaining the population in remote areas. People do not
understand why, as all three countries would become net contributors to the
EC budget, Brussels should not fund some of these subsidies just as it did
for disadvantaged southern rural areas when they joined the Community.
Scepticism towards the EC in societies that are wary of outsiders has been
reinforced by the recent disarray within the Community. Confronted by
confusion over the Maastricht treaty, currency chaos, recession and, not
least, the woeful EC response to war in former Yugoslavia, public opinion
has hardened against the Community, just as it has within many of the member
countries.
Opinion polls show the No camp in a clear lead in Norway and Sweden and, at
best, only a fragile Yes vote in Finland. The three Nordic governments,
particularly those in Oslo and Helsinki, are thus adopting a muscular pose
in the negotiations. Each has promised to hold a referendum before making
the final decision on accession, and they are worried that they will lose
unless they are seen to have struck a hard bargain. Hence Mr Esko Aho, the
Finnish prime minister, whose own rurally based Centre party is divided over
the EC, talks of the Community having to adopt a 'northern approach'.
In spite of such utterances, it could be a mistake for the EC to conclude
that the Nordic countries do not really want membership. With the possible
exception of Norway, it is hard to find senior policymakers, officials,
businessmen and even trade unionists who do not think the three would be
better off inside than outside the EC. The prospect of breakdown in
negotiations tends to induce a collective shudder.
There is a clear undercurrent of anxiety over the possible consequences of
being left out - of the north becoming a dead-end street, as one Swede put
it. A recent Finnish study showed that 77 per cent of voters thought Finland
would soon join the EC, suggesting a belief that there is no practical
alternative. Many people throughout the region say that, if the Community
were in a more upbeat phase, as it was at the end of the 1980s, a Yes vote
would be easy to attain. There remains the faint suspicion that the
Community, exhausted by the events of the past 18 months, is ambivalent
about enlargement.
If the leaderships on both sides are sincere in their expressions of mutual
commitment to the goal of Nordic accession, they are doing a poor job of
getting the message across to the public. An impression of distrust will
grow if the autumn round of negotiations proves as difficult as predicted.
Instead of allowing attention to be focused on disputes over subsidies per
head of reindeer, political leaders should try to rejuvenate the vision of
the Nordic countries taking their place in the expanding family of European
nations. Perhaps an EC-Nordic summit on board a Baltic cruise liner would do
the trick.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Heretical thoughts on currencies: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blowing apart of the European exchange rate mechanism last month was the
second failure of a fixed, but theoretically adjustable, exchange rate
system in 25 years. In the immediate postwar decades the US was the proud
anchor of a global version of the ERM known as the Bretton Woods system. It
broke down for painfully familiar reasons. The US failed to keep inflation
under control in the late 1960s, thus undermining the existing set of
exchange rate parities. The strains were magnified by the growing mobility
of international capital - small by today's standards but still a
destabilising influence.
As both the US and Germany have failed to provide the stability required of
anchor nations, and as no other anchors are in sight, should the world's
monetary authorities accept that floating rates are here to stay? Most US
economists would say Yes. With Dollars 900bn of foreign exchange
transactions occurring daily, they believe governments cannot hope to do
more than influence the pace of currency adjustments through shrewdly timed
interventions, such as the US move last month to support the dollar.
Free market economists are comfortable with floating rates because they
regard the exchange rate as a price: the price of one money in terms of
others. They see the case for flexible rates as part and parcel of the
general argument for flexible prices. Since governments have no means of
discovering what constitutes a correct or 'equilibrium' exchange rate, they
should not attempt to dictate to markets. Price rigging inevitably creates
distortions, whether the market is for fish, coalminers or the pound
sterling.
This argument is actually less strong than it appears. The essence of market
mechanisms is that they are tailored to the different circumstances of
particular economic agents. All real prices are the prices of particular
commodities and services. Aggregate price indices - such as the consumer
price index - are statistical constructs with little economic meaning.
Consider what happens when the exchange rate is devalued by, say, 5 per
cent. At a stroke all domestic prices are reduced by this amount in terms of
foreign currencies. The economic circumstances of every exporter are
miraculously improved. The gains are reaped by efficient and inefficient
alike. This is more like a government decree abruptly changing all prices
than a true market mechanism.
Compare this with what happens with fixed exchange rates - when the value of
one money in terms of another is held steady. Since currency movements have
an economic impact only by changing the ratio of domestic to foreign prices,
all the benefits from devaluation (or revaluation) can still be reaped by
changes in domestic prices. If domestic prices fall by 5 per cent, they will
fall by 5 per cent in foreign currency terms without any change in the
exchange rate.
The difference, of course, is that not all prices would fall by the same
amount. If trading conditions abroad were tough, efficient companies would
reduce costs more rapidly than the less efficient, deservedly gaining market
share in the process. The impact of these cost changes would then filter
unevenly through the whole domestic economy.
When free market economists hail the virtues of flexible exchange rates,
they are implicitly accepting the Keynesian dogma that domestic prices (and
wages) are irretrievably sticky. They need to wave the macro wand of the
exchange rate only because the micro economy is inflexible. Yet since the
efficiency of a market system depends on the flexibility of prices and
wages, this is a dangerous concession.
Why should the public always be deemed incapable of accepting the fact that
flexible prices are good for everybody in the long term, even if the need
for occasional falls in individual prices (or wage rates) requires a
temporary sacrifice by some groups? In the 19th century falling prices was
regarded as perfectly normal, and not as a harbinger of doom; if
productivity is rising they are not inconsistent with rising real wages and
profits.
Flexible rates are very much a second best solution. They rarely bring
lasting benefits: the dollar has been devalued 60 per cent against the
D-Mark and 70 per cent against the yen since 1968, without a conspicuous
improvement in the US trade performance. Yet the wild gyrations of flexible
exchange rates impose significant costs, because they undermine the ability
of producers of real goods and services to plan for the long term. It is no
accident that protectionist pressures began to intensify after the collapse
of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s.
Creating zones of currency stability will never be easy. But the success of
the 19th century Gold Standard suggests that fixed rates are compatible with
the kind of economic strains experienced today. Capital was highly mobile
then and big economic shifts occurred, such as the rise of Germany as a
manufacturing power. But the credibility of the Victorian commitment to low
inflation, irrevocably fixed exchange rates and flexible domestic prices and
wages were indispensable props. The fact that we have to rely on the blunt
instrument of floating rates today should be seen as a mark of failure, a
sign that the commitment to market principles is still very partial in most
countries.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last week's poorer than expected payroll figure, the focus of many
participants in foreign exchange markets will again be on the dollar/D-Mark
exchange rate, writes James Blitz.
Although there is little in the way of US data over the next few days,
Friday's payroll figure is likely to cast a shadow over the dollar over the
next few weeks. It tends to be seen as an important indicator of the data in
the forthcoming month.
With the August figure turning out to be a drop of 39,000 on the month
compared to expectations of a rise of 144,000, the scope for continuing
disappointment in the US economic recovery may be high.
Expectations of a cut in official German interest rates at Thursday's
council meeting of the Bundesbank could also be disappointed.
The Bundesbank may be encouraged to ease policy because of the strength of
the D-Mark against the dollar. Last month, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president-elect, said a strong D-Mark would not be in the interest of German
exporters.
However, data for M3 monetary growth last month - when the Bundesbank
intervened in currency markets to try to keep the ERM together - have not
yet been released, and are expected to be well above target range. Mounting
evidence that the recession in Germany has bottomed out may also stay the
Bundesbank's hand.
This may also be the week when fund managers analyse the currency weightings
in their portfolios for the autumn - and the evidence is that they are
heavily overweight in the dollar at a time when it has a strong downside.
According to some analysts, fund managers would have to shed 10 per cent of
their dollar holdings to get a neutral position.

FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: US events give food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been a certain amount of scepticism in the UK that long-dated gilt
yields - already at post-war lows - have much further to fall. But events in
the US on Friday may have given the sceptics food for thought.
The publication of exceptionally poor unemployment figures sent long-bond
yields to historically low levels. As Treasury dealers mulled the growing
belief that a hesitant recovery means inflation will be held at bay, yields
sank to below 6 per cent.
Although there is no guarantee that the UK recovery will mirror that of the
US indefinitely, there has been a fairly strong correlation so far.
The implication for gilts dealers of Friday's news is that in a year from
now, the UK recovery will be as cautious and non-inflationary as the US
pick-up is proving to be, some two years into its recovery. Such news has to
be good for gilts.
But a glance at the latest round-up of City forecasts shows that analysts
are far from agreed on the future course of inflation. Forecasts for growth
in the retail prices index for 1994 currently range from 2.5 per cent to as
high as 6.5 per cent.
The UK government bond market appeared to enter a consolidation phase last
week, with prices little changed on the week.
However, given lingering concerns about the future course of inflation based
on the short-track record of recent improvements, the big question for
dealers is where will the market head next. Have long yields dropped as far
as they can, or do they, as in the US, have further to go?
On Friday, yields were virtually unchanged on the week, in spite of a fairly
busy week's trading.
The yield on the 7 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1998 was 6.31 per
cent, compared with 6.30 per cent on the previous Friday's close. Further
out, the 15-year 9 per cent bond yield closed at 7.22 per cent compared with
7.24 per cent a week earlier. The yield on the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond
maturing 2017 was virtually unchanged at 7.22 per cent.
Although the spread of forecasts for inflation is wide, most economists do
not expect the RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, to breach the
upper limit of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in
1994. Even those who were pessimistic at the beginning of the year are
revising their forecasts downwards.
'Earlier this year we were gloomier about inflation than we are now,' said
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel. 'But the rebound that we
were expecting from food retailers did not happen and service sector
inflation has also come down sharply.'
Analysts also appear to be drawing comfort from the very apparent commitment
of Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England, to holding down
inflation. Last week, Mr George told the Securities and Investment Review
that it was unacceptable to accept even a little bit of inflation.
'The danger is that it accelerates in an uncontrollable way to become quite
a lot of inflation,' he said.
There are even suggestions that the UK's notorious attachment to inflation
is being broken at a more fundamental level.
'While the current low level of inflation is largely a consequence of the
recession, a low inflation psychology is developing in the UK and a policy
framework now exists to manage it. So a low inflation recovery is possible,'
says Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities.
Brave words indeed. If so, gilts may yet go on to perform as well as their
US counterparts. However, even those who are most bullish about prospects
for inflation would perhaps like to see just a little bit more evidence that
it has been stifled before another rally in gilts can take off.
Money supply figures from the Bank of England on Friday showed that overseas
enthusiasm for gilts has been going from strength to strength.
The Bank sold a record Pounds 1.9bn of gilts to foreign investors in July,
following sales of Pounds 1.1bn in June. The record July sales came in a
month that saw yields drop by 75 basis points.
The August M0 figure contained little to worry the gilts market. Narrow
money grew by 5.2 per cent in the year August, which was slightly lower than
expectations of 5.4 per cent.
The figure, which pointed to a steady recovery in consumer spending, was
anyway inflated by a big increase in the annual rate of bankers operational
deposits, which comprises a small part of M0. These are more influenced by
conditions in the money markets than by economic activity.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Belgian Bonds: Snowballing debt keeps yields above 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the European bond market rush for the pot of gold, Belgium has been left
at the back of the queue. While its EC partners have seen phenomenal rallies
in the past few months the Belgian bond market has languished.
A league table of international debt markets monitored by J. P. Morgan shows
Belgium as the worst performer in August, providing a return of only 0.61
per cent in local currency terms - for the same period Italy's return rose
5.54 per cent.
Then, late last week, when many were beginning to consider that Belgian debt
prices had been left too far behind, the central bank announced it was
raising central interest rates from 9.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The news
sent bond prices plunging by up to two percentage points for some
maturities. A wave of selling pushed the yield on 10-year bonds back up to
7.3 per cent against 7 per cent in July.
On Friday, prices continued to fall and yields to rise, widening the gap
with German bund returns to some 115 basis points as the market factored in
a slide in the Belgian franc to BFr22 against the D-Mark. Some analysts
believe there will be no pick-up until early November and then only if wages
are frozen under the social pact to be thrashed out at the end of the month.
Belgium's problems are encapsulated in its soaring public debt, which stood
at around 116 per cent to GNP last year, the highest in the OECD. Ms Jane
Edwards, economist with Lehman Brothers, says the recession and the central
bank's determination to maintain high rates to protect the currency's parity
with the D-Mark are leading to snowballing debt, a situation where debt
spirals because high debt means high interest rates which lead to more debt.
She says interest payments on public debt were close to BFr800bn last year
and are unlikely to fall this year or next.
Ms Edwards argues that Belgian bonds will be attractive once a wage
agreement is reached. But any solution to the crisis is likely to involve
lower short-term rates which will also weaken the currency, so overseas
buyers would have to hedge against currency falls.
A more optimistic case is put by Bear Stearns, the US securities house,
which has taken the widening spread between Belgian and German 10-year paper
as a pointer to the prospective value and recommends a switch from bunds to
Belgian paper.
Mr Craig Shute, an economist with Bear Stearns, claims: 'Domestic
considerations point to lower short-term rates by the end of the year, even
if it means breaking the franc/mark tie.' Mr Shute published his research
shortly before last Thursday's plunge and when the bund/Belgian bond spread
was around 85 basis points.
Whether his enthusiasm is justified depends on whether Belgium is prepared
to unshackle its monetary policy from that of Germany, where unification has
led to relatively high inflation that has to be fought by a tight monetary
policy.
As with Denmark, Belgium fears that a decoupling of monetary policy from
Germany would reveal fundamental economic problems that could be ignored
when the European monetary union project was strong.
But since the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism divergence
margins from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent the German link has looked
increasingly spurious. Two weeks ago, a group of 14 Flemish economists
called for monetary policy to be relaxed. They said that continuing to tie
the Belgian franc to the D-Mark - a policy pursued since 1990 - would damage
industry and employment prospects and was no longer an acceptable option.
Late on Friday, speculation that the Belgian franc's tight link to the
D-mark would be dropped as well as news that the state budget deficit rose
to BFr76.9bn in August left short- and long-term debt markets rudderless.

FT  06 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Wall St divided on strength of rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US credit market reached a historic landmark on Friday when the yield on
the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell below 6 per cent for the first
time in its 16-year life. But, amid the celebrating, Wall Street Cassandras
were quick to wonder how soon the remarkable bond market rally of the past
few months might go into sharp reverse.
The factor which finally took the long bond through 6 per cent was a
surprisingly poor unemployment report for August on Friday morning, which
suggested at first glance that the economy was growing more weakly than
expected.
By the close of trading, the issue was showing a yield of 5.94 per cent,
down from 6.14 per cent a week earlier. The rest of the yield curve also
dipped by 20 - 22 basis points, with the 10-year note ending the week at
5.28 per cent.
With US interest rates at their lowest in 25 years, investors face a
dilemma: is the bond rally of the past six weeks a sign of a seriously
overheated market, which is bound to end in a sharp correction and an upward
turn in the interest rate cycle? In short, is the bond market rally about to
peak out?
Or does the rally mean the market is entering a new trading range,
reflecting an economy facing a prolonged period of low growth and low
inflation, and that this could push interest rates down even further, back
to the level of the 1960s? Wall Street is divided. Few analysts forecast the
long bond would breach 6 per cent, yet after the event many argue that the
bull rally remains relatively secure, though it is bound to suffer
short-term corrections. A minority, however, warn that the market is
seriously overbought.
The main factors behind the rally provide ammunition for both camps. First,
many statistics suggest US economic growth remains subdued, and President
Bill Clinton's tax increases and healthcare reforms could further retard
expansion.
However, last week the government revised its estimate of second-quarter GDP
growth up to 1.8 per cent, compared to the 1.6 per cent initially reported.
And August's employment statistics were not nearly as bad as the headline
figures would suggest. Businesses may not be hiring new workers, yet hours
worked are rising at a respectable 2.5 per cent annual rate.
Coincidentally, the surprisingly poor August figures came exactly a year
after very similar statistics prompted the Federal Reserve into its last
easing move, and some of Friday's bond rally may have stemmed from hopes of
a repeat performance by the central bank. Yet the Fed seems unlikely to
change a rates regime which, by underscoring its anti-inflation hawkishness,
has been a powerful contributor to the current rally.
Nor do there appear to be any significant inflationary clouds on the
horizon. The only statistic of note to be released this week will be
Friday's producer price index for August. The overall PPI may show the first
rise in four months, but the increase is expected to be modest, at around
0.2 to 0.3 per cent.
Apart from economic fundamentals, market forces driving the bond market
rally have included the Clinton administration's reduction in the supply of
30-year bonds, and heavy demand from both banks, taking advantage of the
steep yield curve, and mutual fund investors seeking higher returns. Flows
of cash into bond funds jumped 22 per cent in July to a record Dollars 13bn.
There are no immediate signs of this tide turning, yet mutual fund investors
could prove volatile if a run of adverse economic statistics suggests the
market is peaking out. Any correction - be it the turn of the interest rate
cycle or not - could prove nasty.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Broadening the horizons of currency
exposure management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, the use of derivatives by non-financial companies had only
sparked interest among shareholders if disaster struck. In these instances -
such as Allied Lyons' Pounds 150m loss in 1991, when a treasury official
wrote uncovered currency options - the focus tended to be on the cause of
the short-term hit, usually speculation or inadequate management controls.
However, more attention is now being paid to the broader implications of a
company's policy on currency risk management. The volatility in exchange
rates in the last year, and the virtual collapse of the exchange rate
mechanism, has heightened the awareness of institutional investors of the
potential impact on profitability of a company's approach to currency
exposure.
Last year, the Association of Corporate Treasurers published a set of draft
guidelines designed to make it easier for institutional investors to analyse
the implications of foreign exchange management. The subject has been a
matter of intense debate, since there is some opposition to increasing
disclosure, but definitive guidelines are expected this autumn. Mr Gerald
Leahy of the ACT said there was a strong feeling there should be better
qualitative, if not quantitative, information on treasury policy.
Stock analysts are also waking up to the importance of currency hedging in
analysing an international company's performance prospects. For example,
Credit Lyonnais Laing recently published a ground-breaking piece of research
on the UK drinks industry entitled 'Currency hedging in the drinks sector',
which provides an unusually detailed examination of the practices of
companies like Grand Metropolitan, Guinness and Bass.
As well as defining the extent and nature of these companies' foreign
exchange exposure, analyst Ms Julie Bower details their policies on dealing
with their exposure.
She notes that in general, 'too much attention is paid to the exposure of
companies to currency movements as reported in their accounts, and too
little to the underlying long-term competitive positions of companies under
various exchange rate scenarios'.
There are three types of currency exposure: transaction exposure, which is
the exposure to exchange rate movements between a sale and its settlement;
translation exposure, which relates to the effects of currency movements on
a company's accounts when reported in the home currency, and is held to be
of significance only for accounting purposes; and economic exposure, which
describes the extent to which the present value of expected future cash
flows changes with currencies.
Ms Bower argues that companies tend to concentrate too little on the third
of the these categories. '(Economic exposure) is a true exposure which
managements should be seeking to optimise through a financial management
programme that complements their long-term strategic planning process.'
She makes the important point that hedging can be financial or strategic.
For example, Japan's Nikka Whisky Distilling Company bought a large Scottish
distillery in 1989, reducing the operating risk of being dependent on
exported whisky from Scotland for its own Japanese blended whiskies by
hedging its long-term economic exposure to the sterling/yen exchange rate
through an investment in the home market of its suppliers.
Undoubtedly, the pressure on companies to provide better information is
increasing. Last year, Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential
Portfolio Managers, described information given by most companies as
'minimal' even though the Report and Accounts is the correct medium for
disclosure.
Most senior managers claim they are anti-speculation, yet they follow
selective hedging policies designed to protect against anticipated adverse
currency movements. Yet in practice it is often the case that hedging is
only useful in protecting the company against unexpected changes.
The consequence for investors is uncertainty. If a fund manager buys a UK
stock because he thinks the company will benefit from increased US earnings,
he needs to know if the dollar exposure of that company is hedged. At
present, he is often in the dark.

FT  06 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Austria and Exim deals revive Euroyen
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH last week of two large yen-denominated Eurobond issues by
top-quality borrowers has helped to revive investor interest in the Euroyen
sector of the international bond market.
The Export-Import Bank of Japan raised Y75bn through an offering of 10-year
Eurobonds and the Republic of Austria established a new benchmark at the
long end of the Euroyen market with its Y60bn issue of 12-year Eurobonds.
Syndicate managers say that Exim's 10-year Eurobond issue has helped to open
up the Euroyen sector for other Japanese government-guaranteed entities.
In the past, the Japanese finance ministry had discouraged them from raising
yen-denominated funds outside the domestic bond market. However, the
ministry has changed its stance in recent years.
So far, the Japanese Development Bank (JDB) has been the only
government-guaranteed entity to issue in Euroyen. It has launched two such
offerings in the past two years, and is thought to be considering a third,
of the same size and maturity as Exim's.
Austria followed rapidly on Exim's heels, and both issues have provided
liquidity which is badly needed at the long end of the Euroyen sector. Both
issues were priced against the World Bank's yen global bond due 2003. Exim's
issue was priced to yield six basis points above the yield on World Bank's
bond. Some managers said the issue was generously priced.
By contrast, the pricing of Austria's issue, launched at a spread of 13
basis points over the yield on the World Bank bond, was widely regarded as
tight. Some syndicate managers said the spread should have been five basis
points wider to compensate for the extra two years of the bonds' life.
However, a spokesman at the lead manager, Yamaichi International, said last
week the pricing was justified by the quality of the borrower and demand for
long-dated paper.
The pricing also reflected Yamaichi's view that Japanese interest rates will
be cut in the near future, which would increase the attraction of the 4 1/2
per cent coupon.
Syndicate managers say these two issues could herald a steady stream of
Euroyen issues over the coming months, which would stem the decline in
volume in this area of the Euromarket.
According to IFR Securities Data, the percentage of all Eurobonds issued in
yen fell in the first eight months of this year, to 10 per cent of the total
from 11.5 per cent in the same period last year. By contrast, sterling's
share rose from 8.7 to 12.6 per cent and the D-Mark's to from 9.7 to 14.5
per cent. The dollar's share remains the largest at around 35 per cent.
The data also show that the yen dropped to fourth position in the table of
the preferred issuing currencies from second position.
The lack of swap opportunities this year has deterred non-Japanese issuers
from borrowing in yen. Many issuers only tap the Euroyen sector if they can
swap the proceeds of their offering into dollars which are fixed at a margin
below the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
However, swap conditions have improved recently and Exim is thought to have
exchanged the proceeds from its offering into dollars, achieving an all-in
cost of funds of 20 basis points below Libor.
Non-Japanese borrowers have also been hindered by the yen's appreciation
against other currencies in recent months. Syndicate managers say they are
now looking more closely at the Euroyen sector, encouraged by expectations
that the yen has reached its peak.
'Many borrowers would like to borrow in yen when it is close to its all-time
high because their currency exposure should be reduced in the long term as a
result,' says one syndicate manager.
Expectations of a further cut in Japanese interest rates to boost the
country's flagging economic growth have further enhanced the market
conditions for borrowers. Many economists expect a cut of up to  3/4 points
in the discount rate, which is currently at 2 1/2 per cent.
The Japanese government bond market has been strengthening as a result of
the hopes of a cut in rates. Analysts believe that after the cut, interest
rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.
In the light of such forecasts, investors are keen to buy long-dated yen
bonds which offer a coupon with some premium over the current low yields in
the government bond market.
Yet despite the favourable conditions for borrowers and the current demand
among investors for yen Eurobonds, syndicate managers are careful not to
launch too many new issues for fear of saturating the market.
The Euroyen market is less liquid than other sectors of the international
bond market because of it is still limited to the highest credits, namely
sovereign and supranational borrowers, or triple A-rated corporate names.
As a result, many yen Eurobond issues become illiquid very soon after their
launch. This is a drawback for investors wanting to sell their bonds before
they are redeemed so they are reluctant to buy too many at issue. 'It is a
self-perpetuating problem,' says one syndicate manager.
Last week's deals helped to provide liquidity at the longer end of the
market but syndicate managers say it will take a considerable time before
this vicious circle is broken.

FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Stockholm approves Volvo/Renault
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right government has given its blessing to the full merger,
expected to be announced in Paris this week, possibly today, between Volvo,
the country's premier manufacturing company, and Renault, the
state-controlled French car and truckmaker due to be privatised.
'Volvo is very important to the Swedish economy, but this is a
market-oriented government,' said a senior government official. 'Our view is
that Volvo as a private company must do what it thinks is right for Volvo.'
Both companies want to announce the merger before the start of the Frankfurt
motor show tomorrow. However, a French government official said yesterday
that the agreement had yet to be signed and a delay until tomorrow or
Wednesday would not matter.
The merger will create one of Europe's four biggest car manufacturers and
the world's second biggest truck group. It will set the seal on a three-year
old industrial alliance which began with an exchange of cross shareholdings
in 1990.
The French government, wary of domestic political sensitivities surrounding
the merger, has insisted on a dominant role in the partnership for Renault,
which it has placed on a list of 21 state-controlled groups it seeks to sell
in an ambitious programme to be launched this autumn.
Motor industry analysts believe the most probable scenario is that the
French car group, currently 79 per cent owned by the state, will have a 65
per cent stake in the joint company.
Renault's chairman, Mr Louis Schweitzer, will be in charge of day-to-day
operations, with the flamboyant Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo
since 1971, as head of the supervisory board.
Aware of the sensitivities in Sweden also over the future of one of the
symbols of the country's industrial prowess, Mr Gyllenhammar has kept Mr
Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, abreast of the negotiations. Volvo
is hoping that other political and market reaction to the merger will be
similar to that of Mr Bildt. Most analysts in Stockholm view a 35 per cent
share for Volvo as a reasonable outcome.
'You can never be sure of anything, but if people look at this in a neutral
way they must see that it is the best deal for shareholders, given the
alternative of a future on our own,' said a Volvo official.
According to expectations, French control will be wielded through a majority
stake in a joint holding company and through a stake in a unit which groups
the automotive operations of the two companies.
But Volvo is expected to retain a powerful influence. Volvo will hold
smaller stakes in the holding company and the industrial unit. It is likely
to have veto powers over strategic issues.

11%

<TEXT>
SIME DARBY, the Malaysia-based conglomerate which claims to be south-east
Asia's biggest multinational, has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars
840.8m (USDollars 331m) for the year to June 30 1993.
The figure represents an 11 per cent rise over the previous year and more
than four times Sime Darby's 1987 profits.
Group turnover was MDollars 7bn, a 14 per cent rise over last year. A final
gross dividend of 16.5 Malaysian cents has been recommended, compared with
14.5 cents last year.
Sime Darby, once largely plantation based, is now involved in a wide range
of activities including the manufacture of rubber products, the oil and gas
industry, property and motor and heavy equipment franchises.
Sime's biggest cash earner was once again its operations in Hong Kong, where
it is the main automotive and heavy equipment distributor. Pre-tax profits
from Hong Kong were up 33 per cent to MDollars 195m compared with MDollars
142m last year.
'This remarkable achievement is the result of a booming economy in southern
China and has taken place in spite of the fact that the future of the new
Hong Kong airport and the Legislative Council elections remain unresolved,'
said the group.
A cutback in logging led to a decline in earnings from the group's heavy
equipment business in Malaysia, but revenues from the group's substantial
involvement in the local oil and gas industry made a significant
contribution to overall profits.
The plantations division benefited from continuing strong prices for palm
oil, though sagging rubber prices resulted in lower production and affected
overall plantations performance.
Mr Nik Mohamed Yaacob, the new group chief executive, said that in the short
term Sime's main priority was to turn round its insurance business, which
continues to make a loss.

THE TORONTO Stock Exchange is to launch on October 1 an index of 100 most
actively-traded stocks. It is designed to help institutional investors
measure Canadian equity performance more accurately.
The TSE-300 Index, now among the most widely used, includes smaller
capitalisation stocks. The new 100 Index will contain only large
capitalisation stocks and the most liquid securities.
It will comprise stocks representing 83 per cent of the total capitalisation
of the TSE-300. A range of derivative products will be ready within six
months.
The new TSE-100 was given a value of 250 at August 31 and will reflect
market changes since then when the TSE begins reporting on October 1.
The TSE-300 continues, and those stocks not included in the TSE-100 will
later form the basis of a new TSE-200.
The 100 index will be updated each April at the same time as the 300. Stocks
in the 100 are classified into resource, industrial, interest-sensitive and
consumer products groups.

<TEXT>
Northern Telecom, the equipment manufacturing affiliate of BCE of Canada and
Germany's Robert Bosch have dropped a joint venture to manufacture
transmission equipment, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Last March the companies announced the venture to produce equipment under
the CCITT global standard. Each planned to put certain assets, technology
and personnel into the project and Nortel would have gained a distribution
channel for some of its equipment in Germany.
At the weekend the two companies would not enlarge on a statement, saying
they have 'strengthened their relationship and are co-operating in other
areas of mutual interest, including several global bidding opportunities.'
Analysts regarded the ending of the joint venture as a potential setback for
Nortel. 'Germany was a key market in Nortel's strategy to become a leader in
European telecom equipment,' said Mr Fredericks Larkin, of Bunting Warburg
in Toronto.
However, industry sources stressed that international market changes may
have dictated the move.
Nortel, in a USDollars 400m note issue filing, said it will would contend a
US tax re-assessment for 1980-85, potentially requiring payment of USDollars
450m. The company said it has a strong case to contest the IRS claim.

CASINO, one of France's largest food retailing groups, achieved a three-fold
increase in pre-tax profits to FFr60.1m (Dollars 10.32m) in the first half
of the year, writes John Ridding in Paris.
The rise from FFr18m in the first six months of 1992 reflected its merger
with Rallye, the supermarket group, at the end of last year.
Net attributable profits rose much more slowly, increasing by 2.5 per cent
to FFr17.6m. Sales rose slightly from FFr33.25bn to FFr33.75bn. But the
group said that the increase was impressive against the background of
falling consumer demand and supermarket price wars arising from the
recession in France.
In a statement to shareholders, Casino expressed optimism about the
remainder of the year.
It said that cost cutting measures introduced over the past two years were
beginning to bear fruit and that the merger with Rallye was progressing
smoothly.

Slaski
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is to offer 60 per cent of the equity of Bank Slaski for sale in the
second privatisation of the country's nine state-owned commercial banks
created in 1989.
The planned disposal of the 5.6m shares comes after the sale earlier this
year of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), in which the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development took a 28 per cent share. Now the EBRD is
expected to bid for a share of the 'large investor' tranche making up 45 per
cent of Bank Slaski's equity for a which a tender is to be announced on
September 14.
The share price agreed under the tender will then be treated as a marker for
the remaining 15 per cent of the equity which is to be offered to 'small'
investors later in the year.
Mr Leslaw Paga, head of Poland's Securities Commission, which approved the
public offer, said the price for small investors would be 'no higher' than
that for large investors, but could be lower.
The procedure is designed to avoid controversies which accompanied the WBK
privatisation, where the offer price was set before a boom on the Warsaw
stock exchange giving investors handsome profits and leading to charges that
the bank had been underpriced.

Morning Post

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in South China Morning Post shares was due to resume today amid
expectations that this week will see Hong Kong's best-known newspaper fall
into the hands of one of China's best-loved overseas businessmen.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation announced on Friday that it was
negotiating the sale of its 50 per cent stake in SCMP, and while the buyer's
name has not been confirmed, it is widely expected to be a consortium led by
Malaysian-born 'Sugar King' Robert Kuok.
The share sale would trigger a general offer for the company, under Hong
Kong's takeover and mergers code, but local newspaper coverage has raised
expectations of an offer below Friday's closing price of HKDollars 5.35.
Based on that price, the Murdoch stake would be valued at HKDollars 4bn
(USDollars 516m).
Mr Kuok commands one of the largest business empires in south-east Asia, and
having made his fortune through sugar trading in Malaysia, he now controls a
wide range of businesses, from hotel and property development to trading.
He has a long track record of investment in Hong Kong, where he is now
based. He recently floated his Hong Kong and Chinese hotel interests, as the
HKDollars 6.5bn market capitalised Shangri-La Asia. However, the purchase of
SCMP would be his largest and most high profile investment in the colony.
It is his China connections which will attract most attention, if he
finalises the deal. Mr Kuok was behind Beijing's first major
internationally-funded property development, the USDollars 480m World Trade
Centre.
He also owns 13 per cent of Hong Kong's largest mainland-controlled
investment vehicle, Citic Pacific, and has substantial investments in
property and trading in China. Beijing would not welcome criticism from
business partners, and is very sensitive to its media coverage in Hong Kong.
As one senior employee at the SCMP stated: 'One of the ironies of this deal
is that in a week's time, Rupert Murdoch may be held up as the last bastion
of free speech and democracy in Hong Kong.'
Mr Murdoch had implemented few changes at the newspaper. He treated it as a
cash cow and paid out the bulk of earnings in dividends, while playing no
apparent role in its editorial content.
He is likely to make more than HKDollars 5bn profit from the deal, and he
was clearly concerned about the future of running an English language
newspaper in Hong Kong after its 1997 hand-over to China, from both a
political and business perspective.

FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Use of Intel technology casts
shadow on AMD
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices has disclosed that its latest microprocessor chips,
to be introduced later this month, will incorporate Intel technology that is
at the centre of a long-running legal battle between the two Silicon Valley
chipmakers.
AMD's sales of 30m clones of Intel microprocessors have greatly boosted the
company's revenues and earnings over the past two years. However, the legal
disputes with Intel - the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer - have
cast uncertainty over AMD's future microprocessor sales and could
potentially make the company liable for substantial penalties.
Previously, AMD had said that it would lift the cloud of legal uncertainty
and achieve 'technological independence' from Intel by designing its own
microcode for the new chips. Microcode is the internal software that
controls the functions of a microprocessor chip.
However, AMD now says its 'independently derived' microcode for new 486
microprocessors - widely used in personal computers - is not entirely
original.
About 25 per cent of the software is 'substantially similar' to software
Intel created for an earlier generation of 386 microprocessors, the company
said.
'The (microcode) development team was exposed to certain Intel 386
intellectual property that had been awarded to us by the arbitrator of our
breach-of-contract dispute with Intel,' said Mr Richard Lovgren, AMD
associate general counsel.
He acknowledged that an appeals court ruling in June had overturned the
arbitrator's award, compromising AMD's right to use the Intel microcode. Mr
Tom Dunlap, Intel's chief counsel, said: 'Once again, it seems that AMD
would rather take legal risks than develop products independently.'
AMD , however, expressed optimism that its rights to the software will be
restored by the California Supreme Court, which last week granted the
company's request for a review of the June ruling.
'We are very pleased the Supreme Court has agreed to review a ruling that we
believe is wrong and manifestly unjust,' said Mr WJ Sanders III , AMD
chairman and chief executive. The review effectively vacates the negative
ruling of the appeals court, AMD said.
AMD also noted that it has been granted a new trial, to begin in November,
of a related microcode copyright infringement dispute with Intel.

FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Molins pension surplus split
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 38m surplus on the UK pension schemes of Molins, the tobacco
machinery and packaging group, has been split between the schemes' members
and the company.
The 6,000 members stand to gain an average of 10 per cent enhancement of
their benefits from roughly half the surplus, while Molins has received
Pounds 11.8m after tax which it will use to reduce group borrowings.
The move had been expected since a proposal to share the surplus between the
company and members was made at the group's annual meeting in April.

FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian Pizza for market with
Pounds 40m value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN Pizza Group, a Salford-based company which exports its pizzas
to several European markets - including Italy - will be floated on the stock
market this autumn.
The group, which will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 40m, was
the subject of a Pounds 15.5m management buy-out from its Canadian parent in
May last year.
Canadian Pizza makes 40m pizza crusts per year and supplies about 35 per
cent of the pizzas sold by UK superstores as their own brands. It employs
250 people at plants in Salford and Nelson in Lancashire.
Pre-tax profits increased last year from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 2.2m on sales
which grew from Pounds 11m to Pounds 15.2m.
The group believes a listing will enhance its ability to exploit the growth
potential of the chilled and frozen pizza market, as the additional capital
raised will be invested in new production facilities. Southern France is a
possible location for a new factory. A growing segment is the in-store
delicatessen custom-made pizza, for which the company supplies cases.
In 1982 Mr Harry Kent, co-founder of the group, began importing pizza crusts
made in Canada by the Canadian Pizza Crust Company, run by Mr Gino Molinaro.
In 1985, Mr Molinaro and Mr Kent established a business to make pizza bases
in the UK. In May last year Mr Molinaro sold his stake in the business to a
management buy-out led by Mr Kent, with the support of Murray Johnstone, 3i
and ECI Ventures.
Mr Kent, the group's deputy chairman, said: 'Pizzas are an increasingly
popular snack food . . . I have no doubt that progress, particularly into
the chilled market, will continue at an above average rate in comparison to
overall retail sales.'
The float will be sponsored by Robert Fleming and Hoare Govett will act as
broker to the issue.

FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Floating to development and expansion -
Maggie Urry reports on Parkdean's plan to shake off restrictions on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAHAM Wilson twice tried to buy out the business he runs. The second time
he succeeded. But now he is as keen to escape from the buy out structure
which is cramping his plans to grow.
The business is Parkdean Leisure, which operates seven caravan and chalet
holiday parks in the UK - five in Scotland and two in East Anglia - and Mr
Wilson's escape route is a flotation which is planned for next month.
He aims to raise between Pounds 7m and Pounds 9m, with most being new money
to repay the group's debt and preference shares. That will give the company
a market value of up to Pounds 15m and leave Mr Wilson with the flexibility
to develop the existing parks or buy more.
Mr Wilson joined the company in 1981 when it was part of William Leech, the
Newcastle based house builder. Leech had seen leisure parks as an
asset-play, but, says Mr Wilson, did not want to put money into developing
them.
He was working on a management buy-out when Leech was taken over by Beazer
in 1985. Beazer decided to keep the business and invest in it. But as its
ambitions spread, Parkdean became less important to its parent once again.
Mr Wilson achieved his aim with a Pounds 6.9m mbo in January 1989, when
Parkdean had 5 parks. That involved a Pounds 2.5m term loan, Pounds 2m of
deferred payments to Beazer and equity, including Pounds 2.17m worth of
preference shares.
Despite the hefty debt, Parkdean has managed to buy three new parks, while
selling one; set up a telesales operation to market the holidays better; and
develop the parks' accommodation and leisure facilities.
But it has not been easy. Mr Wilson first approached brokers about a float
only a year after the buy-out. He was told to 'come back when you're a grown
up company'. In 1991, he raised another Pounds 1m of venture capital and
eliminated part of the deferred payment to Beazer, since taken over by
Hanson.
But, Mr Wilson says, venture capital is expensive and the banking climate
has been poor. There have been times when Parkdean's directors have had to
'hang on to our hats and go for it'. The alternative, he says, would have
been to wind the group down, running it for cash to service the debt and
preference shares.
Now, Mr Wilson says, 'we have got to the point where we can't go any further
because of the structure'. In the financial year to end November 1992,
Parkdean achieved an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m, up from Pounds 1.03m
in 1991. But from that interest charges of Pounds 800,000, tax, and
preference dividends of Pounds 200,000, left little to repay debt and invest
in the business.
Despite the stringencies Mr Wilson and his team have demonstrated an ability
to buy and develop parks, significantly increasing their profits in the
process. With the industry highly fragmented there should be plenty of
opportunities to apply the skills to more acquisitions, and spread the
overheads - such as the telesales operation - more widely.
Only a few months after the buy out, in June 1989, Parkdean bought Grannie's
Hielan' Hame, a caravan park on the north-east coast of Scotland. By April
1990 a new indoor heated swimming pool, with jacuzzi, sun beds and sauna,
had been built. The cost of Pounds 330,000 was partly paid for by a Pounds
100,000 government grant designed to help tourism.
The addition of the pool extended the number of weeks the park is fully let
from 15 to 23, and the number of vans for hire has been increased from 66 to
90 this year. On top of that, the number of owned vans - where owners pay a
rent - has risen from 3 to 30, with Parkdean making additional profits from
trading vans.
Mr Wilson aims to increase from the 120 hire and owned vans to 160 in the
next three or four years. Even that will make the park small by the
standards of many park operators, and the aim is to retain the 'personal
service' which contributes to repeat and recommendation business - that
accounts for over 55 per cent of the holidays sold.
Touring pitches are available too, and Mr Wilson has plans to develop these
for the new generation of caravans which 'hook up' to mains services. He
reckons he can double the overnight rate for such pitches.
He puts the success of a park down to three factors: location, facilities
and marketing. Grannie's, for example, is on a good sandy beach, near a
town, but not surrounded by other caravan parks. As well as the pool, the
facilities include bars and a restaurant, a grocer and a fish and chip shop,
amusement machines, and a launderette.
'First we sell them holidays, then we sell them other things,' Mr Wilson
explains.

FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bank questions NatWest loan weighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster's sensitivities about its low capital ratio led it into
disagreement with the Bank of England over the risk weighting of some of its
credit facilities, it emerged yesterday.
The bank was keen to avoid having to put up capital backing for some of its
undrawn credit facilities, understood to include financing for English China
Clays, the building materials group, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals
company. But it was told by the Bank of England that such undrawn facilities
could not carry zero-weighting for the purposes of calculating its capital
ratio.
NatWest's tier one capital rose from 5.2 at the end of 1992 to 5.5 according
to its interim statement for the first half of 1993. Yet this is still
relatively low for a large clearing bank. The figure was only achieved by
having the results reviewed by the auditors so that retained interim profit
could count towards the ratio.
It is the only bank with which the Bank of England has differed over the
interpretation of the complicated rules on undrawn credit facilities.
NatWest declined to comment.
Undrawn credit facilities of up to one year carry a zero weighting. The
problem arises if they are rolled forward during the year. They are only
then regarded by the Bank of England as eligible for zero weighting if the
lender undertakes a full credit review of the whole transaction which
includes the right to cancel the facility.
The Bank of England has recently relaxed these rules slightly, but it still
insists on lenders obtaining a right to cancel the existing facility, unless
it is rolled forward in the last 30 days of the one year period.

FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sogo stake in Criterion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOGO UK Ltd, the subsidiary of the Japanese retailer, has acquired a 50 per
cent stake in Criterion Developments Ltd from its joint venture partner
Mountleigh, the property company which went into receivership in May, 1992.
CDL owns the Criterion building on Piccadilly Circus in the heart of
London's West End. Sogo made its first UK investment when it entered into a
joint venture agreement with Mountleigh in December 1990, buying a 50 per
cent stake for Pounds 30m.
Mountleigh went into receivership with debts of Pounds 590m. Mr Tim Hayward
and Mr Stephen James, partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, joint administrative
receivers, warned at the time that the disposal of Mountleigh's Pounds 400m
UK property portfolio could take years.
Mr Hiroo Mizushima, president of Sogo Co Ltd, said that the company's full
acquisition of the London site was an important element in Sogo's
international development.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Poison pills lose none of their potency: Richard Waters
examines shareholder suspicion of anti-takeover devices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could be another sign that takeovers in the US are coming back into
fashion. The poison pill, a takeover defence that became one of the most
potent symbols of the 1980s battle for corporate control, made a notable
return last week as Dr Pepper, the US's third-largest soft drinks group,
armed its defences against the UK's Cadbury Schweppes.
The fact that companies rarely adopt such poison pill defences these days
could be partly explained by the fall-off in predatory bids. However, there
is a more powerful reason: most companies already have them.
No less than 331 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have pills in place, most
dating from the mid- to late-1980s. They follow a number of patterns, but
all have the same ultimate objective: to deter unwanted bidders either by
restricting their voting rights or diluting their stake by offering shares
cheaply to other shareholders - the route taken by Dr Pepper.
Add in the companies located in states that have takeover protection
enshrined in statute, such as Delaware, and 87 per cent of listed US
companies have some form of defence.
Such devices still arouse passionate shareholder antagonism. The United
Shareholders Association pressure group promptly denounced Dr Pepper's move,
saying it was designed to protect incumbent management rather than
shareholder interests.
Could such antipathy be misplaced? Experience from the last merger and
acquisition wave suggests that takeover defences do not stop takeovers, and
may actually force aggressive bidders to pay more for their acquisitions.
Certainly, poison pills did not stand in the way of the five biggest
takeovers or mergers in the 1980s. RJR Nabisco, SmithKline Beckman, Kraft,
Squibb and Warner Communications all had takeover defences in place: all
were eventually dropped by the companies' boards to allow the deals to be
finalised.
Research published earlier this year by two economists from the University
of Rochester in New York indicated that bidders have to pay an average
premium of 30 per cent to acquire a company without a poison pill. Buying
one with a poison pill in place adds 18 per cent to the premium.
Such evidence is not conclusive, warns Mr Robert Comment, one of the
authors. However, it at least seems that poison pills do not stand in the
way of takeovers: companies' share prices do not suffer after they have
adopted a pill, and those with pills are just as likely to be taken over as
companies without them, according to the research.
Nonetheless, a low-key war against poison pills continues. Most
anti-takeover devices have a 10-year life, so few have had to be renewed so
far. Some institutional shareholders have forced their companies to put
their existing pills to a shareholder vote, and others are reported to have
used pressure to stop pills being adopted in the first place.
Even if shareholders vote against a pill, it is likely to have little
effect. Unlike Canada, US boards can simply ignore their shareholders'
wishes. Only a few - such as Westinghouse Electric earlier this year - have
dropped pills in recent years.
Dr Pepper said it would not submit its pill to shareholders for approval,
adding that the measure was adopted to protect the interests of those same
shareholders. Not surprisingly, big investors bristle when companies start
suggesting that they are better guardians of shareholders' interests than
the shareholders themselves.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Cadbury fails to sweeten up Dr Pepper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR PEPPER/Seven-Up and Cadbury Schweppes have often eyed each other
longingly but seem unable to agree who should wear the trousers. Whether the
US company is determined to stay independent - or merely playing hard to get
 -is as uncertain as the ultimate intentions of the UK group.
Cadbury, which raised its holding in Dr Pepper to 25.9 per cent last month
by buying a 20 per cent stake from the Prudential insurance company, has not
ruled out further share purchases eventually. But its immediate aim is
further co-operation.
That suggestion has been coolly received by Dr Pepper, which has indicated
that its idea of closer links would involve taking control of Cadbury's
north American beverages business. Dr Pepper makes most of the UK company's
soft drinks concentrates in the US and distributes some of its brands there.
What is beyond dispute is the industrial logic favouring a link-up. Added to
Dr Pepper's 10.6 per cent of the US soft drinks market, Cadbury's 3.4 per
cent would create a force better able to stand up to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo,
the industry leaders. A deal would provide much needed sales channels and
distribution power for Cadbury's US soft drink sales, which rely on a
fragmented network of small bottlers. In return, Dr Pepper's portfolio would
gain from the addition of Cadbury's profitable range of niche brands,
including Schweppes, Sunkist and Canada Dry.
Elsewhere, the two companies' strengths are reversed. Cadbury's operations
in Europe, Australia, Africa and Latin America would benefit Dr Pepper,
which is weakly represented in international markets, where Seven-Up in any
case belongs to PepsiCo.
Though Dr Pepper is highly profitable, its expansion is constrained by heavy
debt, the legacy of a 1986 leveraged buy-out in which Cadbury participated.
The UK company, by contrast, would bring to any deal a robust balance sheet
and strong cash flow.
Nonetheless, many analysts think Cadbury would be pressed to pay the Pounds
1.5bn or more needed to buy the rest of Dr Pepper. Some think a better
option would be to trade control of its American drinks business for a
bigger stake in the US company.
But any such outcome would require the pair's mutual attractions to prevail
over suspicion of each other's motives. As Mr David Lang, of stockbrokers
Henderson and Crosthwaite, says: 'They are natural bedfellows, but neither
wants to be date-raped.'

FT  06 SEP 93 / FTC to look at Merck bid for Medco

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) takeover by Merck, the US's biggest
drugs company, of Medco Containment Services, the country's largest
mail-order drugs distributor, has run into a potential setback with the
Federal Trade Commission's indication that it plans to scrutinise the deal
more closely.
An FTC request to the two companies for more information about the merger
was made at almost the last possible moment under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
anti-trust regulations. The waiting period under the regulations, which
would otherwise have expired last Friday, will now stretch until at least 20
days after the two companies respond to the FTC's queries.
Merck, which announced the news after the stock market had closed on Friday,
said that the request for more information had been made only late in the
afternoon and said it had not yet seen details of the FTC's inquiry. It
added, though, that it was confident the deal would go ahead in the fourth
quarter of the year, as originally planned.
The takeover has aroused concerns among some competitors, who fear the deal
could cut off an important distribution channel. Medco has said that it will
continue to distribute other companies' drugs, although it expects Merck's
products to account for a larger proportion of its sales.
The deal is also subject to approval by Medco's share-holders.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Sale of gold fixers shakes up old club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN two out of five members of an exclusive club want to quit, questions
are inevitable. That is what is happening at the London Gold Fixing whose
five members fix the gold price twice daily.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said on Friday that it hoped to buy
Sharps Pixley, a bullion house that is one of the five gold fixers. A month
ago, Republic National Bank of New York, part of the international group
controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based Lebanese banker, revealed it
planned to buy Mase Westpac, another member of the fixers' club.
It was widely known that Sharps, owned by the Kleinwort Benson merchant
banking group, was for sale. Similarly, London dealers were concerned about
Mase Westpac, owned by Westpac, Australia's biggest bank which has been
restructuring. There is relief that powerful new owners are ready to stand
behind these long-established businesses.
London boasts that it does more physical gold business than any other
financial centre. But that business has slowed to a trickle and, without
activity, bullion houses have little chance of making profits. The recent
gold price surge was mainly based on options-related activity. Higher prices
depressed demand for physical gold in key areas such as the Middle and Far
East.
The rally took gold from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 a troy ounce in
January to Dollars 406.70 on August 2, its highest since the Gulf war in
1991. Another sell-off last week sent the price back to Dollars 364.25 in
London on Friday.
There are fears that disillusioned New York investors will drive gold down
further after today's Labour Day holiday.
Such movements matter little to Deutsche Bank. It claims to be one of the
three largest traders in South African gold bullion, to have 50 per cent of
Germany's gold trading business and an important position in the Australian
gold market. If it acquires Sharps, it will add market-making in London
where it now only trades precious metals.
Also, for what promises to be a relatively small price, Sharps will give
Deutsche a ring-dealing membership of the London Metals Exchange, where base
metals prices are fixed, and membership of the New York Commodity Exchange.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Reed to purchase airline guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED Elsevier, the international publishing and information group, has
finally managed to purchase Official Airline Guides for Dollars 417m (Pounds
275m) cash.
'It's third time lucky,' Mr Peter Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier,
said yesterday.
Reed International tried to purchase OAG, which provides subscription-based
airline schedules and hotel information for the travel industry and business
travellers, in 1987 but the then owners Dun &amp; Bradstreet decided not to
sell.
A year later the business was sold to Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communication
Corporation for Dollars 750m, with Reed the underbidder at less than Dollars
500m.
OAG operates mainly in the US through publications such as OAG Desktop
Flight Guide, OAG Pocket Flight Guides and Travel Age and Frequent Flyer
magazines. Reed Elsevier already owns OAG's rival, the ABC World Airways
Guide, which is strong outside the US.
The deal represents the largest disposal so far of Maxwell's US interests by
joint administrators Price Waterhouse.
Reed has not bought OAG's central database. To save costs, the process of
data collection for OAG and ABC, based in Bedfordshire, will be integrated.
The OAG brand name will be retained as well as separate sales and marketing
teams at the group's Chicago headquarters.
The deal gives Reed Elsevier a near worldwide monopoly of printed airline
guides, although they are increasingly available in electronic form. The
company faces growing competition from the computerised reservation systems
operated by groups of airlines, such as Sabre in the US and Amadeus in
Europe.
Mr Davis argued successfully before US monopoly authorities that bringing
OAG and ABC under common ownership would extend the life of independent
travel information.
'The task is to demonstrate to the airlines that the merger is in the
interests of the business as a whole by becoming more efficient, more
streamlined and not taking advantage in terms of pricing,' he said
yesterday.
OAG's 1992-93 turnover was Dollars 129.5m (Pounds 86m) with pre-tax profits
of Dollars 44.8m. The sale will involve OAG Inc going into liquidation for
Reed to buy assets. Trading will be unaffected.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: A new route to Emu offered by inflation
goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community's monetary committee meets in Brussels tomorrow,
giving officials a first chance to pick over the remains of the European
exchange rate mechanism.
While there has been little official comment on the ERM's future since the
near collapse of the system and the adoption of 15 per cent fluctuation
bands last month, attitudes have been polarising among those concerned with
international monetary policy making.
France and Belgium still hanker after narrow fluctuation margins: an
attachment illustrated by Belgium's decision last Thursday to raise
short-term interest rates to protect the Belgian franc on the very day that
the government announced a sharp increase in unemployment to 14.1 per cent
in August from 13.5 per cent in July.
Elsewhere, however, there is a rapidly dwindling faith in narrow bands as a
way of securing price stability or providing a 'glide path' to economic and
monetary union (Emu).
Officials and economists do want some monetary discipline in Europe,
however. A free for all, with the attendant risks of competitive devaluation
and eventual inflation, could seriously disrupt the European single market
as well as damage hopes of eventually moving to Emu.
So if narrow bands are not the answer, what should be put in their place?
The debacle in the ERM and the realisation that freely flowing capital
movements could undermine any attempt to rebuild the old structure have
prompted a growing interest in those countries that manage their domestic
monetary affairs through inflation targets.
New Zealand and Canada pioneered the use of inflation targets to determine
monetary policy and have so far operated them with success. Britain followed
suit last autumn after sterling was forced to quit the ERM. Other countries
have also adopted targets: Sweden converted to the system at the beginning
of this year.
Mr Lars Svensson, professor of international economics at Stockholm
University and an adviser to the Swedish central bank, says Sweden, which
previously had linked its krona to the Ecu, realised it had overestimated
the capacity of fixed exchange rate systems as a means of promoting
stability. 'Monetary stability and credibility need to be built at home,' he
says.
But how can domestic inflation targets replace an exchange rate regime
covering a number of countries, or point the way forward to Emu?
The answer could lie in a judicious mixture of minor alterations to the
Maastricht Treaty and peer group pressure among the EC countries.
The treaty could be strengthened by adding a specific goal for member states
of price stability (usually defined as 0 to 2 per cent consumer price
inflation). The convergence criteria already define objectives for
inflation, interest rates and budget deficits, but only in relation to other
member countries and not by any absolute standard.
EC member states, setting their inflation targets with the aim of achieving
price stability, would have to accept scrutiny of their policies by other
member states.
For example, a country might decide to slash its interest rates by 3
percentage points to boost growth, producing a sharp fall in its currency.
It would have to explain to fellow EC members how this squared with its
inflation target. If it could convincingly demonstrate that the action was
justified, all would be well. If however, such a move presaged rising
inflation, the others could exert pressure on it to keep its house in better
order.
If the EC member states pursued such policies they should gradually achieve
economic convergence and be in a position some years hence to move to Emu
with its single currency and central bank. Because there would be no narrow
ERM bands, there would be no obvious target for speculative operators, such
as the New York-based hedge funds, to attack.
One problem is that the EC's experience with peer group pressure has been
mixed. Existing surveillance procedures in the monetary committee and the
economic and finance ministers' council have had only limited success in
steering EC economies towards convergence.
However, the community could strengthen peer group procedures by adapting
the planned European Monetary Institute to monitor and comment on member
states' policies. The EMI is due to take over from the EC central bank
governors' committee at the start of next year to help prepare for a single
currency and central bank by the end of the decade. As things stand, the
near collapse of the ERM threatens to leave the EMI high and dry.
A straw poll of continental economists and officials last week showed
considerable interest in such ideas. One senior Italian official said
inflation targeting was 'the logical and reasonable way forward'.
But those advocating inflation targeting and peer review by the EMI said the
EC member states' central banks should be independent, because only then
would the peer review procedures be sufficiently rigorous.
Central bank independence might pose a problem for the UK, which has so far
refused to give independence to the Bank of England.
The idea of inflation targets could also run into problems with the
Bundesbank, which argues that a central bank cannot target inflation in the
way that it can target a monetary aggregate. But the Bundesbank law sets an
objective for the bank of price stability, suggesting that the German
central bank's philosophy is not too far out of line with the aims of an
inflation target strategy.
France would be sure to have big objections. It is the most attached of all
the big economies to exchange rate stability. Its monetary authorities have
invested immense prestige in the Maastricht process and the promise that it
offers of diluting the Bundesbank's control over Europe's economic future.
But an EC-wide monetary policy based on inflation targets has a lot going
for it: how else can Europe move towards Emu without falling prey to Mr
George Soros and his ilk?

FT  06 SEP 93 / Foreign orders for British arms exceed last year's Pounds
5bn record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS orders for British arms so far this year have already surpassed
last year's record of Pounds 5.2bn, Sir Alan Thomas, the Ministry of
Defence's export chief, said yesterday.
Describing the export performance as 'a great and unsung success story', he
vigorously rebutted suggestions that the government had been lax in vetting
where its arms went.
Officials expect the UK's share of the international defence market to
exceed the 20 per cent level which it reached for the first time last year.
This year's export figures had been boosted by the sale of 48 Tornado
bombers to Saudi Arabia, expected to be worth some Pounds 4bn including
spares and support.
The UK now ranks as the world's number two arms exporter after the US.
Sir Alan, who heads the MoD's Defence Export Services Organisation (Deso),
was speaking at a preview of the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment
Exhibition at Aldershot, Hampshire.
He emphasised the MoD's increasing reliance on export customers to help
defray the cost of its own weapons. He said: 'Our future capability depends
on our export success.'
However in spite of rising exports, the exhibition, open to invited guests
only, reflects the decline of the UK defence industry.
Exhibitions of British land and sea weapons were previously held separately
in alternate years. The decision to merge them was made two years ago after
a naval show which was judged to have too few exhibitors to be worth
repeating. However, this year's combined show, organised by Deso and paid
for by industry, is even smaller.
Sir Alan, who has not been called to testify to the Scott inquiry into
supplies of arms and related equipment to Iraq in the 1980s, said it was
'arrant nonsense' to depict Britain as a major supplier to President Saddam
Hussain of Iraq.
The UK had come 'a very poor fifth' among the world's five main
arms-producing nations in supplying Iraq between 1985 and 1990, he said,
adding that it had not sent lethal equipment.
'No other country in the world has a more responsible policy or practice,'
he claimed. He added that the UK obeyed international controls and
regulations on arms sales 'both in the letter and in spirit'.

FT  06 SEP 93 / EC to probe antitrust allegations against Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, VANCOUVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC competition authorities are investigating allegations of antitrust
violations against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company.
According to Microsoft, the EC investigation stems from a complaint filed on
June 30 by Novell, the leading computer networking software company and
Microsoft's arch-rival.
The allegations follow abortive secret merger talks between the two
companies last year.
The Directorate General for Competition (DG4) is currently 'assessing the
merits of Novell's allegations', Microsoft said. 'We believe Microsoft has
acted in a legal and ethical manner and we look forward to presenting our
evidence to the Directorate-General,' the company added.
The EC antitrust investigation mirrors a similar probe by the US Justice
Department, which recently began a review of information gathered over three
years by the US Federal Trade Commission. The Justice Department intervened
after the FTC was deadlocked twice on whether to take action against
Microsoft.
While under FTC investigation, Microsoft made an offer to acquire Novell.
In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading has also looked into charges of
anticompetitive activities by Microsoft. However, the OFT is now believed to
have suspended its investigation in view of DG4's involvement.
Each company now accuses the other of having failed to negotiate in good
faith. Novell is bitter about what it sees as Microsoft's use of the
protracted merger talks to slow its attempts to compete in the PC operating
market. Microsoft says it was Novell that dragged the talks out and finally
called them off.
Novell acknowledged that it and 'other significant software companies' have
been involved in discussions with DG4 about Microsoft.
The complaint is understood to charge that Microsoft has deliberately
attempted to limit competition in the market for personal computer operating
systems. Microsoft, whose DOS operating system is used on about 90 per cent
of all PCs, offers PC manufacturers discounts if they agree to pay an
operating system licence fee for all of the computers of a particular model
sold. Novell claims that this 'per-processor licensing' arrangement
effectively excludes competition from its alternative DR-DOS program.
Novell is also understood to charge Microsoft with illegal 'tying' of sales
of one product to another.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has previously denied both of these
charges.

FT  06 SEP 93 / AT&amp;T given boost in fight for UK market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFTEL, the telecommunications regulator, has given the strongest signal yet
that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph will be allowed to compete with BT in
the Pounds 15bn-a-year UK telecommunications market.
Oftel has invited AT&amp;T to a seminar next month called to discuss the terms
on which competitors should be allowed access to BT's network. The regulator
said AT&amp;T had been invited 'purely for the wealth of its experience in the
US' on the way rival telephone companies reimburse one another for using
their networks.
However, the invitation will be seen as a boost for AT&amp;T in its campaign to
win government approval to compete in the UK. The Department of Trade and
Industry is considering an application from AT&amp;T for a public operator
licence.
The DTI set a precedent for AT&amp;T's entry by recently granting draft licences
to three foreign groups to compete with BT, which has applied to the US
Federal Communications Commission for a licence to allow it to buy and sell
services in the US.
The costs of installing a new telecommunications network are huge. So to
compete effectively with BT, rival operators require access to its national
telephone network to carry their services. The Oftel seminar will examine
the terms on which BT should allow rivals access.
AT&amp;T is the only operator without a UK licence to be invited to the Oftel
seminar, at which BT will give further details of its proposal to publish
tariffs to competitors for connection to its network.
Several regional US operators - all making substantial investments in the
UK's growing cable telephone industry - have made representations on BT's
outline proposal. They will have to make do with a few of the five places at
the seminar allocated to the Cable Television Association.
In its submission to Oftel, AT&amp;T called for BT to be obliged not only to
publish standard connection tariffs, but also to disclose the relevant costs
behind them.
Oftel's draft proposals favoured 'accounting separation' between BT's retail
and network businesses. Most operators favour specific regulation of terms
of access to the local network.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Cadbury will be have more to say about Dr Pepper/Seven-Up's poison
pill when it delivers its interim results this week. Meanwhile the market is
left with the impression that Dr Pepper has dealt it a serious blow.
Cadbury's Pounds 150m purchase of a further 20 per cent of Dr Pepper last
month only made sense with the prospect of close operating collaboration
between the two companies. If they are at loggerheads over ownership, the
chances of that seem remote.
Yet the commercial advantages of getting together would be considerable for
both. Cadbury could strengthen its distribution in the US and Dr Pepper
would gain access to overseas bottlers who were not involved with either
Pepsi or Coke. Dr Pepper's latest outburst may simply reflect its
management's desire to avoid ceding control, at least on the cheap. If so,
an eventual compromise seems likely.
The elegant solution would be for Cadbury to sell its US carbonates business
to Dr Pepper in exchange for shares and a seat on the board. That would give
it a large stake, which it could equity account, in a business with 15 per
cent of the US soft drinks market, while sparing the need for a rights issue
to fund a full hostile bid. The drawback is that such a half measure could
underline Cadbury's lack of critical mass in the world market.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The kerfuffle over whether Ofgas was or was not trying to curb British Gas's
international expansion must have sent a shiver through the company's
boardroom. Despite hopes that a new chairman and director general might
strike up a better working relationship, it has raised the spectre that
tensions between the two sides may remain. Such conflict in the gas industry
contrasts with other utilities and raises concerns about consistent
regulation. Companies often complain that regulators' decisions are not
explained and vary between industries. Under the circumstances, calls for a
'super-regulator' to oversee the system are understandable. Yet that would
add to bureaucracy and increase the risk of industry regulators being
undermined by companies appealing over their heads. More palatable is the
idea that both regulator and company should be required to disclose more
information. The fairness of each case could then be more easily determined.
True, the company might be more likely to ask judicial review of decisions,
but to do so it would have to publicly disclose its case - including
presumably any commercially sensitive infor-mation.
Another way to alleviate tension might be a kind of 'small claims court' to
resolve local disputes at a level below that of a full Monopolies and
Mergers Commission enquiry. The Office of Fair Trading might act as honest
broker and prevent the kind of nuclear warfare which broke out between
British Gas and Sir James McKinnon.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a leap of faith to believe that UK insurers can maintain the level
of insurance profits evident from their interim results. Since investment
returns are likely to be lower than in the past, and the memory of recent
underwriting disasters are still fresh, good intentions abound. But even two
consecutive years of underwriting profits would be an achievement not
managed in the 1980s. With balance sheets restored to health by rising
equity markets and rights issues, underwriting discipline will be harder to
maintain.
What can not be achieved by management might eventually be achieved by
regulation. Prudential guidelines in the US discourage companies from
backing insurance liabilities with risk assets such as equities and
property. There is sense in the argument: an October storm combined with a
stock market crash last year would have left more than one UK insurer
exposed in the US. That the devaluation of sterling has helped recapitalise
the sector is of little comfort.
Similar regulations at home would mean profound change. Sun Alliance, for
example, invests around 15 per cent of reserves against future claims in
equities - a sum equivalent to around twice shareholders' funds. Robbed of
that gearing to equities, insurance profits would assume greater importance.
In theory, there is no reason why that should matter, but the evidence is to
the contrary. UK insurers have lagged the stock market over the last 20
years, while their US counterparts have outperformed.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: BNP's private hopes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since BNP will be the first in the looming wave of French privatisations, it
stands to reason that investors will be offered an attractive deal. Frantic
preparation is now under way on the offering, which looks likely to be
targeted heavily towards French retail investors. Keeping international
buyers short would be one way of whipping up appeal. As with Spain's
Argentaria sale earlier this year, their enthusiasm could spill over into
the domestic market, creating a virtuous circle of demand.
Blow away the froth, though, and a more complex question arises. Having
virtually doubled over the past year, BNP's investment certificates are
discounting a substantial earnings recovery. The market assumed that, by
announcing a 42 per cent increase in first-half bad debt provisions, Mr
Michel Pebereau, BNP's new chairman, was clearing the decks for such a
recovery. Provisions could again be high in the second half, though, given
BNP's heavy exposure to the small business sector which is taking the brunt
of the current downturn.
With the authorities still reluctant to cut interest rates, it could be 1995
before BNP delivers a solid earnings recovery. Admittedly, it may be
striking when it comes, simply because peak provisions will have been so
high. Even if Mr Pebereau only manages a modest clampdown on costs, there
could also be significant growth in operating income.
The danger is that the shine could be taken off by the plan for BNP to raise
additional capital to purchase a further 10 per cent of the UAP insurance
company. Such a move fits with official policy of giving privatised
companies an interlocking network of stable shareholders, but it makes
little commercial sense when BNP already has its own life insurance
operation. Above all, it risks being dilutive: UAP's longer term recovery
prospects are considerably less exciting than those of BNP itself.

While most of Asil Nadir's personal effects went under the hammer at
Christie's last month, a rather less public tender of his wardrobe has also
been in progress, arranged by auctioneers Edward Symmons &amp; Partners.
From the catalogue, it would appear that Nadir's waistline was almost as
volatile as the price of Polly Peck shares, with suits ranging from 34 to
38-inch waist to be disposed of.
More intriguing, however, is the collection of shoes, mostly size 10, but
one pair size 9 and one size 12.
Would that Hush Puppies could speak.

A new generation of advertisers is going to work on an egg. Many years on
from the little lion, ink-jet technology now enables packagers to print the
'best before' date on the eggs themselves; hence, following government
recommendations that all eggs be so labelled, the advertising industry is
scrambling to use this domestic hoarding.
And once European Community agriculture ministers have discussed
egg-labelling at their meeting in Brussels later this month, a call for
mandatory dating across the Continent could open a huge market.
Domino Printing Sciences, which has pioneered the process in the UK, says
common standards will have to be adopted by packaging companies to make
advertising worthwhile.
But it predicts that cooks will soon be cracking egg-verts to make their
chefs d'oeuvres.

When Paul Keating drops by Balmoral in the middle of this month, his purpose
is to let Queen Elizabeth know, doubtless in his ever-diplomatic way, that
his country wishes to, er, dispense with her services.
Should there be a lapse in the conversation, Her Majesty might, however,
care to point out to the Australian prime minister just how difficult it
would be to cast off all ties with the old country.
When the Ozzies revert to their unofficial national anthem - Waltzing
Matilda - they will still be singing to the music of an 18th-century army
recruitment song, which originated in Rochester, Kent.
Devised for the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns in the war of the Spanish
succession, its opening words roll along to the same old tune: 'And come, be
a soldier with Marlborough and me . . .'
Taken down under by the convicts, it was left to 'Banjo' Patterson to swap

FT  06 SEP 93 / Observer: Fireman's fight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness Mahon merchant banker Bruce Fireman's experiences with the
broadcast media have hitherto tended to be bathed in tears rather than
champagne.
His first flop was at university, when he launched a weekly, New Cambridge,
to take on the well-known Varsity. But it folded, with a Pounds 700 loss, as
the 49-year-old Fireman now recalls.
In 1980 he was involved in a bid for the Southern ITV franchise and lost -
although he did make five grand by selling his consortium's registered name
of TVS to the winner.
During the 1991 ITV franchise round, he managed to push his next consortium,
White Rose Television, over the programme quality threshold, only to be
outbid by Yorkshire.
In between, during a 12-year stint at Charterhouse, he helped raise the
venture capital to launch The Independent newspaper, but broadcasting
franchise came there none.
Finally, Fireman has arrived. For it was he who masterminded the London News
Radio bid that has ousted LBC from its 20-year lock-hold on London's
commercial radio franchises.
'I've got it right at last,' purrs the future deputy chairman of LNR.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Observer: Quayle hunts the clients
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Good to hear that Dan Quayle is earning a crust, most recently as chairman
of FX Strategic Advisers, a joint venture the former US vice-president has
set up with FX Concepts, itself a New York-based consultancy and money
management outfit that specialises in foreign exchange.
Karl Jackson, Quayle's old national security adviser who is also managing
director of FX Concepts, says the idea of the offshoot is to extend the
group's clientele into Asia.
'It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that's where the economic
growth is going to be over the next decade. He (Quayle) is very interested
in that part of the world.'
Jackson, an Asian specialist and a professor at Berkeley before he came to
Washington to join the Bush administration, soon 'latched on to Quayle as
some one to lead the charge regarding policies in that part of the world'.
More recently, he says with refreshing honesty, it has been Quayle that has
done the latching on to him.
Undeterred by Quayle's complete lack of experience in the foreign exchange
world, Jackson points out: 'He gets on very well in Japan, he is very
well-received.'
In other words, the jokes don't flow quite as they do at home?
'There is a veneer of politeness in their culture.'

FT  06 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Blair House and the French PM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE AND Ireland have sometimes made common cause against a common
'Anglo-Saxon' enemy, but Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, who
visits Paris this week, is not that kind of Irishman. Some of his French
hosts, indeed, will see him as little better than an Anglo-Saxon messenger
boy, although the message he brings - that last year's Blair House agreement
between the EC and the US on agricultural trade cannot and must not be
reopened - has the support of the vast majority of the 106 countries taking
part in the Uruguay Round negotiations.
His task of getting this message through to the French has been made more
difficult by the German chancellor who, after talks with the French prime
minister the week before last, declared publicly that Germany too had
'problems' with the Blair House agreement, and implied that he expected a
new or supplementary agreement to be negotiated. Several of his ministers
and spokesmen hastened to explain that this was not what he had really
meant, and Mr Kohl himself allayed Mr Sutherland's anxieties on the point
last week. But clearly he did mean to signal at least some sympathy for the
French position. Bilateral Franco-German talks on the subject have now
started, although the Germans insist their object is to find a solution that
leaves Blair House intact.
Hard to accept
The trouble with this approach is that no solution can both modify the
agreement (as the French insist it must) and not modify it. But politics
obeys different laws from logic. Nearly a year of intensive surenchere
(mutual outbidding) by French politicians in denunciation of the agreement
has left them with a real, if unnecessary, problem. Even a prime minister of
Mr Edouard Balladur's unprecedented popularity would find it very hard now,
after all that has been said, simply to accept the agreement without any
kind of quid pro quo.
What then can be done to make this unwelcome pill easier for the French body
politic to swallow? As far as agriculture is concerned it would be
unrealistic to expect any further concessions from the US. At most the EC
might go through the motions of demanding, or asserting, a right to take
some kind of protective or compensatory action in the event of very large
and sudden movements in prices, or in currency parities. But any tangible
satisfaction will have to come from within the EC itself, and take forms
that do not infringe the agreement.
Commercial policy
The French government might reasonably ask its partners for an undertaking
that they will resist any US demand for guarantees that food imports will
supply a specific share of the EC market. Less reasonably, but on past form
not unrealistically, it may expect a direct transfer of financial resources,
in other words a bribe. Almost certainly it will be encouraged to bribe
French farmers from its own national resources, provided it does so in ways
that neither stimulate increased production nor subsidise lower prices.
As far as possible, however, France's partners should seek to shift
discussion away from agriculture on to the broader questions of commercial
policy that France has raised. The demand for the EC to equip itself with
more credible powers to retaliate against arbitrary protectionist measures
taken by the US or other powers is not unreasonable, so long as those powers
are not abused to placate producer lobbies within the EC; and the demand
that the EC presses for an effective international body, to make sure that
new trading rules are observed, is one that all sincere free traders should
support.
In raising such questions France is behaving more like the great industrial
power it actually is, and less like the carefully fenced rural reserve that
is how it sometimes sees itself. In the last resort, the job of breaking the
French obsession with subsidised agriculture is one for France's own
leaders. Behind a smokescreen of demagogy, they have in fact moved a long
way in that direction. In the present conjoncture they might be able to go
further if at the same time they relaxed their monetary policy, giving
industry a better chance to absorb the labour which, willy-nilly, will
continue to leave the land.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Murdoch and the law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S latest trail of deals and manoeuvres has reopened some
old questions. Britain's Labour party wants him referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, having branded his simultaneous expansion of News
Corporation's satellite TV interests and the price war he has launched in
the UK broadsheet newspaper market 'an affront to democracy'.
However overexcited these comments may appear to those who have not, like
Labour politicians, endured years of abuse from Mr Murdoch's titles, this
renewed debate is of interest across the EC, where structures of media
regulation are bending beneath the pressures of changing consumer taste and
technological advance.
In Britain, Mr Murdoch faces two complaints: that by cutting the price of
The Times from 45p to 30p, News is aiming to kill off the rival Independent
and that the expanded BSkyB (of which Mr Murdoch owns half) when added to
his 35 per cent share of UK national newspaper sales, makes him too
powerful. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a
significant stake, last week launched a new 14-channel pay-TV service, and
is forecast by some to overtake the terrestrial ITV commercial network in
terms of revenues within the next three years.
Predatory pricing
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, says he is watching
with interest the newspaper price war that Mr Murdoch has also ignited in
the tabloid sector. His office's definition of predatory pricing - the
deliberate acceptance of losses in the short term with the intention of
eliminating competition so that enhanced profits may be achieved in the long
term - looks prima facie as if it may indeed apply to the battle between the
loss-making Times and the struggling Independent. The OFT has recently been
active in pursuing bus companies accused of predatory actions, but in
examining the newspaper industry, it will also note how The Independent
worked to ensure the demise of the Sunday Correspondent or, to take an
earlier example, the lengths to which Associated Newspapers went to kill in
its infancy Mr Robert Maxwell's rival to the London Evening Standard.
Predatory behaviour, resulting in short-term losses, does not have to
include a price war.
The question of the concentration of media ownership and the related
regulatory framework is more complex and important.
What can be stated with confidence is that the law is outmoded. This imposes
detailed restrictions upon the ability of newspaper companies to own more
than 20 per cent of terrestrial television and radio (even local radio)
companies and yet sets no limit on the ownership of satellite TV.
Yawning gap
In the press, there is no general law on concentration of ownership,
although the 1973 Fair Trading Act requires that any merger involving
circulations of more than 500,000 should trigger an MMC investigation. In
practice, this has not impeded Mr Murdoch, who has twice argued that the
only alternative to his purchases (of first The Times and The Sunday Times,
then of Today) would have been the closure of newspapers, thus enabling
ministers to waive the rules.
The yawning gap in these arrangements, however, is the lack of guidance on
what amounts to an unacceptable accumulation of power across the whole of
the mass media. UK law recognises, in the case of the press, that these
matters exceed in importance normal competition issues, since a democracy
needs 'accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion'.
The time has thus come for the UK authorities to wrestle again with this
principle in the new media world that Mr Murdoch has done so much to
develop. It would be wrong to prejudge Mr Murdoch's case, since the barriers
to entry in satellite television are still lower than in terrestrial
broadcasting. Equally, however, it is unreasonable that terrestrial ITV
companies continue to face costly regulatory requirements, for example on
the national origin of programmes, from which their satellite competitors
are exempt. The most promising direction for change is to liberalise the
over-regulated, rather than the converse, but a coherent approach is now a
matter of urgency.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Greens' bogus science: Bronwen Maddox argues that some
environmentalists' claims should be treated with caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public mistrust of science was lamented once again by the British
Association for the Advancement of Science at its jamboree last week in
Keele, Staffordshire. Should the association then welcome the way that
environmental issues are popularising science?
Enrolment on 'environmental science' courses is growing, warnings about the
ozone layer abound in suncream advertisements, and seven-year-olds tyrannise
their parents about recycling kitchen rubbish.
For their part, the 'green' pressure groups are increasingly couching their
campaigns in scientific language. Their traditional 'rubber suit' brigades,
who made their reputations through direct action such as plugging the outlet
pipes of chemical companies, have been joined by squads of PhD holders. The
better-funded groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace now issue
sheafs of closely analysed reports on the impact of toxic chemicals or
radiation.
That research has helped the credibility of the groups' campaigns. But many
of the claims made by environmentalists in the name of science should be
treated with caution. The arguments put forward often lack intellectual
rigour, and they indulge the pressure groups' worst vice: the reluctance to
rank some environmental threats as more significant than others.
One of these misleading arguments is the suggestion that it is impossible to
prove that any substance is 'harmless'. Just because no ill-effects have
been spotted, say some environmentalists, does not mean there are none: they
may have been overlooked, or may not emerge for decades.
This uncertainty, the argument runs, stems from the way that scientific
knowledge is built up. Knowledge constantly evolves, as hypotheses are
tested against evidence and retained, modified or rejected. Therefore,
because accepted theories may be amended in the future, no scientific
'proof' of the safety of a substance can be certain.
As a result, they say, a new 'green' approach to science is needed. In an
article entitled 'How science fails the environment' in the New Scientist
magazine in June, Ms Sue Mayer, director of science at Greenpeace UK, and Mr
Brian Wynne of the University of Lancaster said that 'greener science' would
force the polluter to prove a chemical was safe, not make the
environmentalist prove it was harmful. They demanded that science embrace
the 'precautionary principle' that 'the environment must not be left to show
harm before action is taken'.
This position is nonsense. Science is inescapably an empirical exercise, but
that does not mean that scientific knowledge is impossible. Some theories
have persistently shown themselves effective at explaining why things
happen. Mayer's and Wynne's proposals do not 'shift the burden of proof' to
the polluter - they simply destroy any notion of proof.
The unfortunate consequences of this approach are considerable. It allows
anything to be described as a pollutant, even if damage has not been
observed. It also makes it impossible to call one pollutant less damaging
than another - what about the as-yet-unknown long-term effects? For this
reason, many leading environmental groups were reluctant to acknowledge that
the Shetlands oil spill in January might be less damaging than the Alaskan
one in 1989, even though storms dispersed the Shetland slick quickly.
The approach can also cause 'legal mayhem', in the words of one leading City
solicitor. The precautionary principle is incorporated in a treaty on sea
pollution signed by North Atlantic governments and in parts of UK food law.
But the 'green science' approach makes it hard for governments and companies
to demonstrate that they have taken 'enough' care.
There is a legitimate place for the precautionary principle - as part of
policymaking. The principle, which was endorsed by last year's Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro and is part of UK policy, recognises that scientific proof
often takes time to establish.
For example, it is not yet clear whether recent changes in the earth's
temperature should be attributed to emission of 'greenhouse gases', and
scientists may take several decades to work out whether more warming is
likely. Governments, however, have judged that it is worth acting now
because the effect of warming on climate and agriculture would be unwelcome.
That decision stems from political judgment about the risk that society will
tolerate - it is separate from the science of establishing whether theories
are correct.
The green groups are right to point out that research into the environmental
impact of chemicals could often be more thorough. But the approach that 'you
never know what the long-term effects might be' gives undue weight to the
pessimists. It is certainly not scientific, and it does little to help
people distinguish needless worries from real threats.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Rock solid against Yeltsin's reforms: John Lloyd examines
the battle for political power that is stifling Russia's economic
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vice-president of Russia, a long-time opponent of the president with
whom he was elected a little over two years ago, is suspended from his
duties by the president because he is charged with corruption on a massive
scale.
His allies in parliament declare the suspension invalid and refer it to the
constitutional court.
Though the president's men protest that this is merely a head of state
protecting Russia's reputation against allegations of wrongdoing in high
places, the move is widely seen as the opening of the 'September offensive'
Mr Boris Yeltsin promised against his many foes. The offensive is aimed at
breaking the Gordian knot of political tensions and enmities now so large
and tight that a chainsaw, not a sword, is required.
Russians and western observers are both tired of Mr Yeltsin's promised
'decisive' movements against his opponents. He has so far lacked the will to
smash through the existing constitution to clear the space for a new one: if
this is the long-promised offensive, say Moscow political circles, so be it,
but no smart money is on it.
No wonder he hesitates: the Russian president has a queue of immense
problems that awaits his attention. Tackling any one of them in a decisive
way would shatter the unstable stasis that is Russian politics at present.
He has, in the first place, an incoherent and internally warring government:
not only are the extremes within it accusing each other of corruption, but
so are nominal allies - Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister
suspended from office at the same time as Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi,
had earlier accused Mr Sergei Glaziev, the trade minister and a moderate
reformist, of corrupt practices.
Further, it is riven on economic policy: Mr Oleg Lobov, another first deputy
premier appointed by Mr Yeltsin from the ranks of his old friends, is
pushing hard for the doubling of state investments, even as Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister, struggles to contain the budget deficit
within a limit of 10 per cent of gross national product.
The government's grip on the country's regions and republics is weak: the
shaping of transparent, equally applied laws and taxes is rendered
impossible because those at the top levels of power in Moscow are competing
for allies in the regions and cities with promises and deals.
Private business, in some areas, booms - but often it is the boom of machine
guns, as contract killers remove rivals or non-payers of protection money.
Around 10 bankers have been murdered in the past few months, together with a
handful of foreign businessmen. These assassinations put an effective wall
around the private sector, advertising it as a place only for the greedy,
the corrupt and the well guarded.
To be sure, the profit motive appears to be ingrained: and on the evidence
of former prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's Association of Private and
Privatising Businesses, which held a conference last week, many state
managers are becoming interested in profit, stable prices and investment.
To be sure, too, businesses are being created and some infrastructure
investments are being made in some locations, such as St Petersburg,
Ekaterinburg, Rostov. But the all-consuming struggle for power, like a great
wen, drains energy and resources from all over the country.
The government survives, in part, by placating the political and economic
actors. Mr Vladimir Mau, a former government adviser, mentions the example
of Ulyanovsk region receiving a special dispensation to keep 50 per cent of
the value-added tax it collects, rather than the stipulated 20 per cent.
Word is spreading among other regional leaders, and they are lobbying for
the same treatment. Parliament is discussing a law to give the regions
discretionary powers on what taxes to remit to the centre - precisely the
issue seized on by the putschists in August 1991 as a reason for their
attempt to stop the disintegration of the then Soviet Union.
A weak, split government cannot hope to fulfil the conditions laid down by
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, and administered by the
International Monetary Fund, for the payment of assistance. At the end of
August, Mr John Odling-Smee, the IMF's chief interlocutor with the Russian
government, told it that unless progress was made on curbing the budget
deficit, lowering inflation (now said, by Mr Shumeiko, to be heading for 30
per cent a month once more) and delivering on a reasonable reform programme,
the second half of the Dollars 3bn special fund would not be paid this
autumn.
This quiet indication is an admission of failure by both Russia and the G7.
It was only in the spring that a new headline figure, of Dollars 44bn, was
unveiled as the western package to save Russia. In July the figure was
confirmed by the G7 leaders in Tokyo.
Now, say western diplomats and international economists, the G7 is studying
the figures - especially the amount of western funds ending up in Swiss bank
accounts - and toning down the rhetoric. The political consequences of this
tacit suspension of support for the reform strategy threatens the further
existence of the tiny band of radical reformers within the cabinet itself.
This may mean that the G7 - most of whose members were sceptical about the
US-led Dollars 44bn package in any case - has given up its faith that rapid
reform is possible. Diplomatic conversations refer increasingly to the lack
of a real consensus for change, and are replete with comparisons with those
Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, which managed to
produce solid bases for radical action only after a sufficiently large
section of the political class had become convinced there was no
alternative, and had in turn produced a government committed to such a
policy.
In Russia, the initial Gaidar-led team, whose members were hot-eyed for
reform, has been whittled down to a few weary individuals doggedly fighting
for what they can win and ceding what they cannot. All of the economic
indicators, save the stability of the rouble, which has remained at just
under 1,000 to the dollar for nearly two months, are turning against them.
General Winter, that scourge of attacks from the west, again approaches.
Mr Yeltsin, the inheritor of all the centralist, authoritarian instincts of
Russian political and civil societies, remains the key to action. He has a
strategy of sorts: to share state power not with the parliament but with a
Federation Council composed of regional and republican leaders who will
support his plans for new parliamentary elections and a new constitution. It
cannot be arrived at constitutionally and it lacks many of the attributes of
formal (and informal) democracy. But it may be an effective, if blunt,
instrument for breaking through to conditions within which democracy could
be constructed.
He has also, over this past weekend, bolstered his position with that
substantial part of the political class, which sees him as too complaisant
and weak, by appearing to force Ukraine's leadership to sell its half of the
divided Black Sea fleet and send back the nuclear warheads on Ukrainian
territory to Russia. This takes the wind out of the sails of the nationalist
opposition, and increases the chances that at least the three Slav states of
Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - with most of the central Asian countries and
possibly others among the former Soviet republics - will agree later this
month to huddle together under Russian economic, security and political
hegemony. This partial reconstitution of the union would increase Mr
Yeltsin's standing - though it would further add to Russia's enormous
economic burdens.
But even if this were to be achieved, the Russian president must still
surmount major problems of decisiveness, stamina and belief. He must muster
large amounts of the first two to take on a well-entrenched, many-tentacled
opposition in the middle of a prolonged slump, and push a programme that
means further sacrifices. For that, he must believe in the ultimate
rightness of a radical programme. But what Mr Yeltsin believes is a real
puzzle: time and again, he makes decisions based on what appears to be a
genuinely liberal world view; time and again, his actions, either of
commission or omission, contradict such a view. Thus, when once more he
faces a decisive choice, we cannot know how - or if - he will finally make
it.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Danger of making excessive claims
about value of brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS BEALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The method described in the article on the brand valuation of Intel
(Technology, September 2) is fundamentally flawed. The returns a business
earns above its cost of capital are not earned by brands alone but by the
whole set of current intellectual assets of a business: brands, skills,
technologies, channels of distribution and supply, publication rights,
systems and other information. In Intel's case there is an investment in
technology that dwarfs the advertising and tangible asset investments.
Excessive claims about brand valuation are damaging, because they risk
misleading investors and because they distract attention away from the real
issue of understanding the investment that companies have made in their
entire set of intellectual assets and the returns achieved by them. A
sounder approach is described in the current issue of Professional Investor.
UK investors and managers urgently need to understand these issues if we are
to be competitive in the information economy of the 21st century.

FT  06 SEP 93 / How the wealth of nations changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One advantage possessed by economic analysts at the heart of the US, well
away from the short-term preoccupations of Washington and New York, is that
they have more incentive to study underlying processes. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Minneapolis takes advantage of its situation to do just this; and it
devotes the spring 1993 issue of its Quarterly Review to a study of changes
in the wealth of nations*.
The slogan of the growing gap between rich and poor nations has been with us
for a long time. But the analysis in the review suggests that it is a highly
misleading one. After carefully inspecting standard international data for
the period 1960-85 it concludes that there is indeed a huge disparity in the
performance output of different countries. The five countries in 1985 with
the highest per capita real GNP had output 29 times as high as the five with
the lowest real GNP.
For comparison, the per capita output of the most prosperous US state,
Connecticut, was only twice as high as the poorest, which was Mississippi.
On the other hand the disparity in output between the least and the most
productive workers in the US, as in most other western countries, was almost
as great as that between rich and poor nations. (Relative productivity is
here measured by pay differentials, which would enrage some egalitarians.)
On the other hand there was no tendency for the international gap either to
grow or to shrink. Measured in terms of relative GNP per capita, the gap was
much the same in 1985 as in 1960. But this does not mean that countries were
frozen in their relative positions. On the contrary, there were big changes
in the identity of those at the top and bottom of the world distribution.
There are of course well-known difficulties in taking relative GNP figures
as indices of living standards. It is doubtful if a city dweller in the US
could physically exist on an income one twenty-ninth of the national
average. But, for all their failings, the GNP estimates provide at least a
starting point for analysing international differences.
The table shows some of the main development 'miracles' and 'disasters'. It
is based on the relative wealth of each country, defined as the ratio of its
GNP per head to that of the US. The Federal Reserve authors go on to define
what they call the 'factor change' as the ratio of relative wealth in 1985
to that in 1960.
At the head of the miracle countries comes Saudi Arabia, whose relative
wealth has risen by a factor of more than three. One only has to utter the
word 'oil' and pass on. Next in the list is Lesotho in south-east Africa,
which had an enormous growth opportunity, as in 1960 it figured as the
poorest country in the world. The Congo is another surprising miracle case
which must have started from a pretty low base. These examples show the
snags that exist even in the most sophisticated of international league
tables. The other miracle countries are more predictable: Japan and some of
the south-east Asian 'tigers', plus Egypt and Syria.
Among the development disasters where relative wealth fell was Zambia, which
fell by a factor of more than two and a half. Sadly it is followed in the
disaster league mostly by other African countries. The two non-African
basket cases are Nicaragua and Afghanistan - both ravaged by civil war.
There are no prizes for guessing which part of Europe might have graduated
to disaster status if the tables could have been extended to 1993.
Explanations of these relative wealth changes are inevitably more
speculative. The authors show once again that mechanistic models based on
amounts of standardised labour and capital used do not explain comparative
performance. The unexplained residual has often been attributed without
adequate evidence to human capital, which is natural enough for writers
working in higher education. But the Minnesota authors are unconvinced and
suggest the missing factor is one that they call business capital. This is
not the same as physical investment, but is some mixture of entrepreneurship
and organisational skill.
The Minnesota attempts to model this factor as a kind of inverse of taxes on
profit and capital is less convincing and is carried out in terms of
abstract algebra rather than examination of actual data. Why do US
economists have to downgrade history, culture and plain luck in an
exaggerated attempt to be useful policy advisers?
But for all its imperfections, the Minnesota Review analysis is a big
advance on the typical muddle-headed condemnation of the west for the
poverty of the poorer countries or for the conventional guilt-ridden
responses.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trade as a means to green ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms HALINA WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your leader 'Green thoughts and trade policy' (September 1).
Trade can be of environmental benefit. But it does not make sense to use
this fact to deny the wisdom of trade restrictions to achieve environmental
ends.
The Montreal Protocol is a classic example of an international instrument
which 'entangles' trade and environment policy to achieve its objective.
That objective is not to impose developed countries' domestic environmental
policies on developing countries. It is to protect the ozone layer for the
benefit of all countries.
The Multilateral Fund and the technology transfer provisions of the protocol
encourage developing countries to accept its terms. Crucially, the protocol
also discourages non-participation by means of restrictions on trade in
ozone-depleting substances with non-parties.
Neither the integration of trade with environment policies nor the provision
of compensation by way of funding mechanisms provides complete responses to
disputes arising out of the existence of differing environmental standards.
What is needed is a more holistic policy approach.
We also need to ask what kind of structures would be most effective in
settling disputes arising out of different environmental standards. What
should be the relationship between law and politics in those structures?
Most controversially, what role should they accord to individuals as opposed
to states?

FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trends indicate engineers not
demoralised in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENIS FILER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondents, Nicholas Cox and T Taylor (Letters, September 3)
paint an overly pessimistic picture of the current situation of the UK's
engineers.
The most recent salary survey carried out by The Engineering Council
published in October last year, showed that the average earnings of
chartered engineers had increased by 28.6 per cent over the previous three
years to Pounds 31,768. Eight per cent of chartered engineers earn more than
Pounds 50,000 a year.
The survey also showed that the profession's self-confidence is recovering
from the dip it took in the middle of the last decade. Four out of every
five chartered engineers would now commend the profession as a career to a
young man and only a few percentage points less would do so for a young
woman - figures that contradict any notion of a generally demoralised
profession and confirm its enlightened attitude towards promoting itself as
a career option for women.
As for innovation, there are several bodies operating in this area and it
would not be to anyone's benefit to duplicate those efforts. However, at the
younger end of the scale, where we have a free hand, the Engineering
Council's Young Engineers for Britain competition this year attracted more
than 700 entries, double last year's total. Many of the professional
engineering institutions also have extensive programmes of seminars and
conferences providing education in relevant technical and managerial issues.
No one can deny that the UK's manufacturing base has been hard hit in recent
years. But there is still much constructive activity aimed at counteracting
that trend on the part of the engineering profession and there are positive
reasons why engineering is an attractive, stimulating and rewarding career
option.

FT  06 SEP 93 / On the lookout for the vision thing: David Goodhart on the
need for fresh ideas at this week's annual gathering of the battered TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain, according to many trade unionists, is an increasingly unpleasant
place in which to work. A shrinking number of employees, they argue, enjoys
'steady jobs' offering security and prospects, while a growing army of
workers - from highly skilled professionals to labourers - is subject to the
hire-and-fire whims of hard-pressed, or plain ruthless, employers.
Much will be heard about this Britain at the 125th annual gathering of the
Trades Union Congress which opens today in Brighton. But not many of the
1,000 delegates will be reflecting on why, if working life is so unpleasant,
the number of people reaching for the protection of the trade unions is
falling. Even in the late 1980s, when more than 1m jobs were created, the
trend was downwards. Now, TUC-affiliated unions represent only 30 per cent
of the workforce.
Moreover, the row over the return of the Electricians Union to the TUC and
other domestic tiffs will distract delegates from pondering what trade
unions have to offer their other customers: employers, not to mention the
national economy in the latter 1990s.
One person with longer-term strategy on his mind is Mr John Monks, 48, the
thoughtful new general secretary of the TUC, who promises a relaunch of his
battered organisation and, he hopes, the whole trade union movement.
The arrival of a new leader is generating a flutter of optimism among the
trade union elite that the movement can make itself more relevant. On the
face of it, however, its prospects are gloomier than ever.
Despite the loss of political influence under Tory governments and the more
restrictive legal framework of the past decade, British unions still have an
influence greater than warranted by their actual numerical strength in large
manufacturing plants and the public sector.
But that position is now under serious threat. Financial constraints, caused
by falling membership, will be exacerbated by government moves to curb the
automatic deduction by companies of trade union dues from wages.
More worrying for the unions is the way in which the withdrawal by employers
of union recognition, once the exception, is becoming common. The oil
industry provides the latest example.
'In some workplaces, unions have become so marginalised that they are
disappearing with scarcely anyone noticing. In many other workplaces the
union presence is poised on a knife edge, with employers now considering
whether the hassle of getting rid of them is worthwhile,' says Mr Alan Cave,
a management consultant and former head of research at the GMB general
union.
Many would regard that view as exaggerated, but certainly some union
officials fear the devolution of decision-making to local managers in the
public sector will threaten this heartland of trade unionism.
In addition, in both public and private sectors, employers are increasingly
removing their most-prized employees from collective bargaining and offering
them individual contracts.
These trends towards derecognition may be irreversible, but there are other
reasons for the decline of trade unionism which the TUC could address. In
particular, union leaders need to improve their record of recruitment in
those areas where new jobs are being created and among women, who are
filling most new vacancies.
'Unions are still not female-friendly organisations and, until recently,
they have done very little on pushing for equal pay,' says one woman union
activist.
The middle-ranking supervisor or lower manager of 'middle England' -
pinpointed by Mr Monks as another key group needing union support - also
still regards the unions with suspicion.
'Ideally we would start again with a new name and without the cloth cap
associations which the unions still have,' says one TUC official. 'This
should be a great time for union recruitment. The fact that it is not is
more our own fault than down to employers or the government.'
Middle England is not at ease with the unions' collectivist traditions or
its Labour party links. Mr Monks, unlike the leaders of some of the biggest
TUC unions, is keen to distance the TUC from the Labour party and turn it
into a much more apolitical lobbying organisation.
Even Mr Monks, however, is enough of a traditionalist to baulk at the
argument that unions must accept the decline of collective bargaining and
concentrate resources on assistance to individual employees, for example in
negotiating individual employment contracts.
However, there is evidence that the tailoring of union activities to
individuals has widespread support among union members. A 1992 survey by the
Nupe public services union found that, even among relatively low-paid health
service and local government workers, advice on disciplinary issues and
grievances came ahead of pay bargaining on the list of reasons for joining a
union.
Unions are already providing such legal services for many members and are
effective at negotiating redundancy deals. Making a virtue of that and
selling union membership as an individual's workplace insurance may run
against the collectivist grain for many unions, but it may be a necessary
ingredient for survival.
Yet to remain an effective mass-membership organisation, as opposed to just
a political lobbying organisation as in France, will also require the union
movement to keep at least tacit support from employers. That is a point Mr
Monks acknowledges, boasting that some of the most efficient and successful
companies in Britain recognise unions - including most of the UK's 50
leading exporters.
According to Mr Robbie Gilbert, head of employee relations at the
Confederation of British Industry, unions still have a role in channelling
the employees' 'voice', especially where there are large groups of workers
who do not qualify for individual treatment.
By increasing employee security, unions can also help in the management of
change. At Rover Group, for example, the unions helped to negotiate a 'no
compulsory redundancy' agreement during the transition to Japanese-style
working practices. That has helped to allow considerable flexibility within
the company because employees do not fear losing their jobs. Mr David Bower,
Rover personnel director, also reports record numbers of employee efficiency
suggestions - which last year saved Pounds 10m.
Unions, say consultants like Mr Cave, can provide a useful pressure on
employers by 'whistle-blowing' on everything from cutting training budgets
to poor health and safety standards. Union lobbying, even on non-employment
issues, for example on higher investment in research and development, can
make a difference inside companies without requiring a formal apparatus of
worker representation.
Unions also have a potential to act beyond the confines of individual
companies. Unlike most companies, unions have links across whole industries
which they can use strategically, for example, by trying to establish a
better trade-off between pay and jobs across a sector.
Mr Gilbert of the CBI suggests that unions could have a role in creating a
better balance between employee security and labour flexibility. That could
be achieved, he believes, be encouraging employees to develop mobile skills,
rather than clinging to particular jobs. 'That means unions lobbying
companies and the government for the highest possible level of training and
retraining so that, if people do lose their jobs, it is not a disaster
because they are readily employable elsewhere.'
This is not an easy agenda for unions. But there are some workplace trends
in their favour. For example, the increased emphasis on teamwork production
methods has the potential to increase shop-floor clout in large
manufacturing companies.
The challenge for Mr Monks over the next decade is to ensure that union
influence does not retreat - US-style - into a few ghettos in manufacturing
and the public sector. This week he must show he has the vision and
imagination to prevent that fate.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Merit in paying MPs by performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MANNERING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported on September 1 that the royal household is to go on to
merit pay ('Queen decrees pay by merit') and that Norman Lamont is to work
two or three days a week in the City to supplement his MP's salary of Pounds
30,854 ('Lamont returns to City as Rothschild director').
In the interests of providing value for money to the electors/taxpayers and
performance incentives for MPs, has the House of Commons considered
introducing performance-related pay for itself? Pay could be positively
linked to the hours an MP spends providing 'exceptional service' in
representing constituents, and inversely related to the time devoted to
company directorships, journalism, writing memoirs and sundry other
pursuits. Most MPs, presumably, would welcome such an arrangement.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Acid rain plan would not hit coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From GILL WITTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Bronwen Maddox's article, 'Dilution measures for acid rain' (August
31), she indicates that fears about the future of the coal industry lie
behind the UK government's reluctance to commit itself to adequate
reductions in sulphur emissions at last week's pan-European negotiations in
Geneva.
It was for this reason that the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF UK)
commissioned its own last-minute research. That research reveals that the
future of the British coal industry and effective measures to reduce acid
rain deposition are not mutually exclusive. It shows that, even with 80 per
cent emission reduction (the level recommended by scientists), the UK could
burn 37.5m tonnes of British coal without committing itself to flue gas
desulphurisation (FGD) construction. With 12 GW of FGD (the original UK
commitment), the UK could burn 46.2m tonnes of British coal (50 per cent
higher than is likely to be used in 1993-94).
The report also shows that there could be up to 30 per cent more acid rain
damage in some parts of Europe if the UK government insists on reductions of
70 per cent rather than 80 per cent in sulphur emissions. This discrepancy
could spell disaster for sensitive European ecosystems. Under such
circumstances Britain will surely have earned its reputation as 'the dirty
man of Europe' and encourage yet more 'dritt-sekk' type comments.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Asko Ensemble - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU schedule a programme of new music at ten on a Thursday night, you get
the audience you might expect: this was a Queen Elizabeth Hall concert with
the gloom and the boom of a nine-tenths empty Albert Hall around it. There
at the middle the Asko Ensemble of Amsterdam were playing brilliantly under
the young British conductor Jonathan Nott.
Of the four pieces, there were recent chamber concertos, all with the
virtuoso soloist being chased and filigreed by musicians of similar skills
and intensities. Ligeti's Piano Concerto came off best, perhaps because its
fascinations drew the ear into intimacy through all the echoing space.
Ligeti has related his astonishing music of the last decade to fractal
geometries, and the Piano Concerto supports that connection with its
swirling detail, its ceaselessly reinterpreted patterns and its suggestions
of things we know: Baroque toccatas, the exultant pulsations of
Afro-Caribbean folk music, wan smiles of fading Romantic pathos, brassy
jazz.
As this performance demonstrated, it is also a comedy' especially for the
percussionist, who tails the piano in a manner at once manic and silly, and
who brings the whole thing to a sudden stop with a sharp knock on the
woodblock. But everyone was on excellent form, from the racing-fingered
Roland Pontinen at the piano to the poetic double-bass player.
The other mini-concertos both featured the violinist Irvine Arditti. Luca
Francesconi's Riti neurali was again music of echoes, but more deliberately
so, the work of a Berio pupil in having a soloist who is part Paganini, part
folk fiddler playing into the reverberations of a small orchestra. Brian
Ferneyhough's Terrain, new last year, lost most from the scale of the place.
Mr Arditti's solo line, almost uninterrupted through the 12 minutes of the
piece, was full of nimble wonder, but diluted by distance from fervour (the
characteristic first marking is 'tense, electrified') into something more
like grace, as if the violin were a bird skimming over a landscape of
rolling harmonic hills and fizzier things from an octet borrowed from
Varese's Octandre.
That homage was followed by the bursting, vital reality of Varese in a
performance of Integrales which Mr Nott ably heaved and steered without a
score through all its splendour, crackling percussion configurations and
lonely, finely played oboe melody.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Brian McMaster's Edinburgh festival - Alastair
Macaulay reflects on the highs and lows of this summer's three-week event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was the first Edinburgh festival that I 'did' from first to last - from
opening concert (August 15) to final performance (September 4) - and kept up
an average of 3 shows or more per day. It had an unusual stream of
accidents, starting with the mysterious fire at the Playhouse, which
continued right through to the last week, during which two sopranos and one
mezzo carried on despite announced throat complaints. It also had its no-nos
(the most lacklustre opening concert anyone can recall) and its lulus (the
theme of James MacMillan's music 'in focus').
Yet Edinburgh's remains a uniquely beloved festival, not least because of
Edinburgh itself. Some of the critics who complained loudest about
individually disappointing events in 1993 nonetheless spoke of their great
happiness in being here again. One reason for that was this year's glorious
weather, which made the architectural and natural beauties of the city stand
out with exceptional definition. Even at night-time, the moon hung low in
the sky above the castle - most memorably on the evening of the great
fireworks concert.
The Edinburgh festival is also held dear for three other reasons: its
success in combining multiple arts, its function as a meeting-point of all
manner of people interested in the arts, and the lively co-existence of
official and fringe events. So what if Aeschylus was mauled by a charlatan?
So what if Julius Caesar kept being drowned by airplanes, tractors and a
grain-dryer? So what if the three Lenz plays showed very well why we have
seen so little Lenz before now? You had only to go to Holbein, or the
Lindsay Quartet, or The Broken Jug, and you fell in love with the arts all
over again.
But this has been true of Edinburgh for donkeys' years. What of the festival
under Brian McMaster? Well, you could tell that he had an audacious penchant
for the unorthodox last year, when he launched his regime with Schoenberg's
Moses und Aron. (Nobody dared make the old crack 'Are you sitting
comfortably? Then I'll play you some Schoenberg.') He has suffused his
festival with a mentality both international and fringe - as I realised last
Friday, after a day that had included a morning lieder recital by a German
thalidomide basso, a matinee play-reading of Jakob Lenz's The Soldiers, an
evening concert of minor Janacek and minor Schubert, and a late-night
concert by a Catalan protest singer.
For many of us, the main fun of the Edinburgh festival lies in what it
teaches us that we never knew before. These days, the festival has specific
themes, and this appeals to the eternal student in me; I arrive looking
forward to a three-week course in subjects about which I know too little.
But 1993's themes were an odd bunch. The Schubert/Janacek theme was designed
less to cover either composer properly than for compare-and-contrast
purposes, not often to stimulating effect. The Verdi 'from first to last'
theme omitted so much of Verdi 'in between' that it proved a wish sandwich.
And the MacMillan theme has put scores of us off his music for good. Next
year's themes, it is said, will include Goethe and Beethoven: which
Edinburgh should be able to serve judiciously.
The most successful 1993 theme was the bringing together of the work of four
of today's most celebrated foreign theatre directors - Peter Sellars, Robert
Wilson, Robert Lepage, Peter Stein (though it is revealing that the
festival's most perfect - and most beautifully acted - production of all was
Thomas Langhoff's account of Kleist's The Broken Jug). Here is a theme I
would love to see taken further. Imagine, for example, a festival where we
saw four or more international directors' contrasting treatments of
Shakespeare or Ibsen plays; or Greek tragedies. Imagine a festival that gave
us every Chekhov play, each one staged by a different master.
For some of us, there is another, more specific, reason why we cherish the
Edinburgh festival: namely, the 11am concerts at the Queen's Hall. Six
mornings per week you can start the day with chamber music or a recital,
and, even when the music is not to your taste, the act of sitting and
attending in quiet to music is the best possible daily therapy - perhaps
especially to those of us who spend much of the rest of each day focusing
more upon the other arts. It is strange but true that, since much of the
Queen's Hall music is of highest standard, you really can feel that your
life has been enlarged a little, several days a week, before lunch.
Let me not sound too lyrical about this year's assortment. Apart from
MacMillan (oy vey), the Gould Trio and Steven Osborne simply were not of
international standards. OK, Osborne - like MacMillan - is a good Scots boy;
but this was the second year in which we watched his tense and
unauthoritative way with piano classics. As for the Gould Trio, their
phrasing lacks firmness, and their violinist is slipshod. But the recitals
by Anne Sofie von Otter, the Lindsay Quartet, Yuri Bashmet, Dawn Upshaw,
Andras Schiff, Thomas Quasthoff, Sylvia McNair - each of these was a special
event, memorable and moving.
This year (and last, and next), there has been one ideal Edinburgh artist,
the choreographer Mark Morris - who is both international and fringe,
theatrical and musical, alternative and classical, and who is plainly one of
the superlative artists of our day. His theatrical visions - just see Grand
Duo and Home - are equal to those of the above theatre-directors. There is
enough dissidence and modernity in Morris to suit him to McMaster's spirit;
and McMaster has responded by making sure that Morris's dances are
accompanied by world-class musicians. Sight and sound are thrillingly, and
festively, conjoined.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Hysteria at the Royal Court - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST the best line in the new play at the Royal Court is the first. The
central character sits motionless in his chair long enough to be convicted
of hamming. Then he opens with: 'If you are waiting for me to break the
silence, you will be deeply disappointed.'
This is also the last line of the play. For given that the central character
is Sigmund Freud, you would expect a certain synthesis, synthetic or
otherwise. In the meantime we have been on a rare helter-skelter that opens
like a mystery-thriller, moves quickly into farce, then has long periods of
semi-seriousness.
Enjoyment of Terry Johnson's Hysteria will depend almost entirely on your
mood on the night. Having returned from duty at the Edinburgh festival, I
was looking for fun and a touch of southern frivolity, and very good some of
it turns out to be. It is pleasing to hear that Freud had recently been to
see Rookery Nook in the West End and had laughed four or five times. Since
laughter for Freud was clearly a serious matter, that is a lot.
I also enjoyed seeing Johnson emulate some of the best of the farce
tradition: a naked girl, the daughter of the subject of one of Freud's case
studies, hidden in the closet, and Salvador Dali, wonderfully played by Tim
Potter, prancing about in his underclothes.
The inevitable line takes a long time to come, but is worth waiting for. Old
and doddery in London in 1939, Freud trips over the carpet. 'It was only a
Freudian slip,' is the natural response. It is a pleasure, too, to find the
Royal Court taking such an eclectic approach to its choice of plays. This is
partly the same team that gave us John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation in
this theatre: Phyllida Lloyd as director and Mark Thompson as an excellent
designer of sets.
Others, however, may prefer the more serious parts which centre on Freud as
analyst and theorist and possibly Freud as a fraud. It is alleged that he
changed his views when he saw how oddly they fitted with his own family
background.
I am unable to comment on how far that is true. The central theme that Freud
and Dali were both frauds, though of a different kind, seems slightly
implausible. Freud at least had a degree of seriousness which has passed
into almost everyone's consciousness. Still, the equation between the two is
something that theatre audiences in the right mood might like to discuss
afterwards. There is also a Jewish doctor who goes on about Freud and
Jewishness and a thesis that Moses was an Egyptian which, the doctor says,
ought not to be published in the late 1930s. Some people might like to take
that as a serious theme as well.
For my part, I preferred the funny bits. Henry Goodman is a compelling
Freud, but the mix is not quite right.
Royal Court Theatre (071) 730-1745.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Fears for live events funding - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world, well, that scrap of it known as the arts sponsorship world, was
amazed when the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts came up
with a figure of Pounds 64.4m for corporate expenditure on the arts in
1991-92 and predicted that there might even be a slight increase this year.
If ABSA wants to ensure that its forecast comes true it need only add in the
Pounds 4.5m that Classic FM has raised through sponsored programmes in the
past year.
It is hard to argue that the Classical Gas programme, sponsored by British
Gas on the station; Classic Verdict, which appears thanks to Clerical &amp;
Medical, and the station's Summer Music Festival programme, sponsored by
Kenco (impressed by rival Nestle's success in underwriting the charts on pop
commercial radio) are not a form of arts sponsorship.
Certainly the latest initiative, a Pounds 100,000 investment by Prudential
to ensure that its sponsorship of the Prudential Awards for the Arts is
better known, is designed to help the arts world. Through the coverage, the
4.5m listeners of Classic FM, will hear all about the activities of
short-listed companies like Theatre de Complicite, Opera North, and the
Shobana Jeyasingh dance troupe, and will be encouraged to see them.
There is a fear that the money spent on sponsoring arts programmes on
television and radio, which is now being actively encouraged by the media
involved, will take away funding traditionally put behind live events. There
is the possibility that some companies will feel happier investing in media,
which they understand through their advertising expenditure, rather than in
sponsorship. But TV and radio coverage will need the events of the living
arts to promote, and anything that gets business thinking about the arts as
a marketing outlet, rather than traditional brand and corporate advertising,
is a good thing.
* Slowly, almost imperceptibly, ABSA Consulting is being launched on to the
world. It is a risky business for the Association for Business Sponsorship
of the Arts, a charity designed to increase corporate funding of the arts,
to start up a commercial subsidiary. It has traditionally given free advice
to its corporate members.
It will still do so. If you want a quick opinion about a new sponsorship, or
a run down of opportunities in the dance field, say, or in drama, ABSA will
still weigh in with its experience. But if you are a long-term sponsor who
is thinking of revamping its sponsorship programme and needs an audit of
past activities and some considered research into potential commitments, or
a totally new sponsor looking for guidance and perhaps a packaged arts
programme, then ABSA Consulting will charge you the rate for the job based
on its hours of research and its lengthy documentation, prepared by still to
be recruited internal consultants.
ABSA has always been a big player behind the scenes. It advised Digital when
it launched its rescue programme for Sadlers' Wells based around dance, and
helped English Estates with its important educational work. In future such
time-consuming advice will be costed. ABSA's task is to ensure its hundreds
of corporate members that they can still look to it for free day-to-day
guidance on sponsorship matters.
* The Barbican is the first arts organisation (festivals excepted) to take
full advantage of the extra cash available under the re-vamped Business
Sponsorship of the Arts scheme, which this year has Pounds 4.5m of
government money to hand out as encouragement to arts sponsors. Since April
the maximum top-up for an arts company with a sponsor in tow has increased
from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 35,000, and, more importantly, during a year it
can make four applications (instead of two) and receive a maximum of Pounds
50,000 in state aid, double the old limit.
The Barbican secured its Pounds 35,000 when the German bank Norddeutsche put
up the same amount to underwrite an exhibition of the work of Mucha, and
quickly reached its Pounds 50,000 limit when Levi's backed the exhibition of
photographs by Bill Brandt, which also opens this month.
So far nine arts companies have qualified for the Pounds 35,000 boost,
mainly festivals, like the Brighton and the Covent Garden, but also
exhibitions, like the Holbein show at the National Gallery of Scotland,
backed by Capital House Investments, a first time sponsor. Another first
time sponsor qualifying for Pounds 35,000 is BUPA, which is supporting the
Council for Music in Hospitals in a number of events this year.
Applications for BSIS cash provide a good monitor of the state of the arts
sponsorship industry. ABSA, which administers the scheme, is actually
turning away more applicants this year, especially those arriving late. All
told it expects to receive a record 600 requests this year, suggesting that
arts sponsorship has ridden out the recession better than most.
* Tate &amp; Lyle, as a member of the Per Cent Club, devotes a proportion of its
profits to good works, of which the arts merit 15 per cent. Most of this,
Pounds 120,000 over the past three years, has naturally gone to the Tate
Gallery, founded by Henry Tate in 1897.
The link is due to end next month but already the search is on for a
continuing connection. In the past Tate &amp; Lyle has sponsored the Friends of
the Tate, providing the seed corn money which has enabled the Friends to
grow in numbers and revenue. The Friends contribution to the Tate Purchase
Fund now approaches Pounds 100,000, and included the commissioning of the
Patrick Heron coloured glass window in the new Tate St Ives.
* The London Philharmonic Orchestra has just returned from a twelve concert
tour of South Africa. It is the first visit to the country by an important
British arts company for many decades. The tour was sponsored by Nedbank, a
leading South African banking organisation, for an undisclosed but
'substantial' sum, presumably around Pounds 100,000.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With television it never rains but it pours. You can go months without any
sort of experimental programmes and then, within 24 hours, find three new
series starting. Screenplay Firsts is BBC2's slot for new short dramas
'united by a commitment to innovation, topicality and the development of new
television talent'. This year eight new films are being shown, from Britain,
the US and Germany, starting today with a double bill. 'Schwarzfahrer' (Fare
Dodger) is about a racist old lady sitting next to a black youth on a bus,
and 'The Burden' portrays an exiled Polish musician who finds himself back
with bureaucracy when he befriends a young child in a park.
Channel 4 begins Midnight Underground (12.20), a season of 'classic
experimental' films, which sounds like an oxymoron, but as the series
includes work by people such as Bunuel and Man Ray you see what they mean.
There are four films tonight, all on alternative spirit worlds, including
Kenneth Anger's 'Inauguration Of The Pleasure Dome'. Tomorrow BBC2 begins a
new series of 10 x 10, a showcase for short programmes by new directors.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (12): Magnetic island in the sun -
Bermuda is the world's fastest growing offshore centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERMUDA, home of some of the world's fastest growing and innovative
reinsurance companies, has benefited from a flood of new interest this year.
More than half a dozen new reinsurance initiatives have been launched,
bringing more than Dollars 1bn in fresh capital to the island and
consolidating its reputation as the world's biggest offshore insurance and
reinsurance centre.
Until this year Bermuda was known as a centre for captive insurers and more
recently for highly specialised reinsurers which offer high-level liability
covers.
Centre Re, the biggest of Bermuda's reinsurance companies with assets of
Dollars 2.9bn, has pioneered so-called finite risk transactions, while ACE
and XL insure large - mainly US - corporations against legal awards.
In June, American International Group, one of the world's biggest insurers,
reinforced this trend by sponsoring the formation of a new excess liability
company, Starr Excess Liability Insurance. Other backers include General Re,
Munich Re, Primamerica and Aon Corporation.
However, most attention has focused recently on the catastrophe reinsurance
market, with Bermuda hosting a number of significant new initiatives by
North American insurers and financiers. Attracted by the recent strength in
reinsurance rates and prospect of attractive profits, Marsh McLennan, the
world's biggest insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the US bank, sponsored the
formation last autumn of Mid-Ocean, a new Dollars 350m reinsurance company.
The company began underwriting in January and in the summer announced plans
to go public in the US with an initial public offering expected to raise
nearly Dollars 250m.
In the last six months five similar ventures have been formed:
American International Group announced it was setting up a property
catastrophe reinsurer, International Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Co,
which aims to provide excess of loss treaty reinsurance for personal and
commercial risks. AIG has a 24.4 per cent stake in the Dollars 300m company
which will also underwrite retrocessional business for other reinsurers and
also some non-catastrophe business.
Investors including General Re, the biggest US reinsurance company, and AIG
have raised Dollars 500m to support Tempest Reinsurance, which is expected
to begin underwriting in October.
Goldman Sachs, the securities house, and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance
broker, are organising another company, Global Capital Reinsurance, which is
expected to have some Dollars 300m in capital. Investors include
Underwriters Re Holdings Corporation.
Investors including Warburg, Pincus Investors, General Electric Pension
Trust, Investment Private Placement Partners and USF&amp;G, the US insurance
company, are raising Dollars 140m to invest in Renaissance Reinsurance. It
plans to underwrite property and short-tail casualty insurance, earning more
than 60 per cent of an expected Dollars 100m a year in premiums from the US
market.
Centre Re itself has formed a Bermuda-based shell company, Centre Cat, which
will also underwrite catastrophe reinsurance.
Separately, General Re is opening a wholly-owned underwriting management
company, to help meet growing demand for back office services on the island.
Two obvious attractions are Bermuda's tax regime (companies pay no income or
corporation tax and can build up tax-free reserves allowing them to build up
much stronger financial strength to meet large scale claims) and its benign
regulatory environment.
Bermudian companies are able to avoid the very high so-called 'frictional'
costs, which are typical of a market - such as London - in which dozens of
relatively small insurers and brokers combine to insure and reinsure large
risks.
They tend to conduct a small number of high-value transactions, transferring
huge blocks of risk on to their own books in exchange for multi-million
dollar premiums.
Already there are signs that the amount of fresh capital in Bermuda is
having an impact on rates and terms and conditions on international markets.
One prominent London underwriter estimates that capacity for leading US
buyers has risen from around Dollars 120m per event to Dollars 150m per
event in recent months.
So far, however, there is little sign that Bermudian underwriters are
winning market share at the expense of established marketplaces in the North
America and Europe, either by offering cheaper policies or better security.
Mid-Ocean, the most active Bermudian catastrophe reinsurer at present,
generally underwrites portions of reinsurance programmes, in which prices
and conditions are set by so-called 'lead' underwriters in Lloyd's.
The new companies look set to follow suit. Mr James Stanard, chief executive
of Renaissance, says: 'Much of our business will be participations on
catastrophe programmes led by recognised lead underwriters.'
Although there is concern among some US reinsurance buyers about the quality
of security in the London market and particularly at Lloyd's, other buyers -
especially from Europe and South Africa - are equally sceptical about the
durability of Bermudian companies and are particularly mindful of the
problems experienced by many Bermudian companies in the mid-1980s.
Industry leaders such as Mr Michael Butt, the chief executive of Mid-Ocean,
insist that the Bermudian market 'complements' rather than competes with
London. Indeed in some other ways the Bermudian market has recently provided
direct support for Lloyd's underwriters. Underwriters Capital (Merrett),
another new Bermudian company, was formed with the specific purpose of
providing quota share reinsurance to the syndicates of the Merrett Group,
for example.
Centre Re agreed at the end of last year to back a multi-million pound
reinsurance scheme, which will allow Lloyd's Names to obtain stop-loss, or
personal, reinsurance. And Centre Re also provides dozens of financial
reinsurance policies - called 'time and distance' policies - which allow
Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves more flexibly.
However, as the Bermudian market develops and the confidence of buyers
increases, local Bermudian underwriters may begin to seek to lead business.
One prominent London underwriter predicts this could happen in the 1995
renewal season. 'Customers are already using Bermuda as a stick to beat us
over the head,' he says.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (11): Aware of the risks - Life
becomes more complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LIFE reinsurance has traditionally been the low-risk, low-margin end of the
business tacked on to a much larger and more profitable general reinsurance
capacity,
But staggering losses in some business classes, including usually safe areas
such as home and auto reinsurance, are causing a re-think about the merits
of life cover for the reinsurance business.
Mr Roger Sansome, director of long-term business at Mercantile and General,
a subsidiary of Prudential plc and the UK's largest life reinsurance
underwriter, said that 10 years ago only a third of M&amp;G's business was life
reinsurance. Now, life reinsurance is two-thirds of the total and that could
go as high as 75 per cent.
'If you get the market right, you should be able to make a better profit out
of the non-life business because it's more volatile. The life business is
less so and the profits are lower.'
But because risks are fairly predictable in pure life cover, reinsurers are
able to estimate the incidence of future claims and to price products
appropriately.
Indeed, the great shudder which ran through the life reinsurance industry in
the late 1980s, when the Aids virus first posed a threat to existing
actuarial calculations, has now proved to be somewhat overblown. The
incidence of Aids among Britain's insured population has turned out to be at
the lowest end of estimates prepared by the Institute of Actuaries and both
premium rates and reinsurance rates have eased in the past year.
Mr Wayne Daniel, product development actuary at M&amp;G, said that at his
company the premium rate to guarantee a Pounds 50,000 sum assured for a 30
year-old man nearly doubled in three years to reflect the increased risk of
Aids. In August 1987, that man would have had to pay monthly premiums of
Pounds 7.30 but by April 1990 that had risen to Pounds 14.55. But the lower
than expected rate of Aids has pushed premium rates down to Pounds 12.90 in
April 1993 and there may be scope for further premium reductions.
However, pure life cover, the core of the business, is increasingly taking a
back seat to the higher risk but potentially more lucrative market of
'living risks'. 'We think the growth is in all the areas where people can
claim while they are still alive,' Mr Sansome said, noting that the pace of
expansion in these types of policies now outstrips that of straight death
cover.
That view is echoed by Mr Jonathan Ludbrooke, assistant general manager at
Munich Reinsurance which holds roughly 25 per cent of the UK's life
reinsurance market. 'For years the reinsurers have been banging the drum and
saying to the life insurers that protection products are the way to go. Now,
the direct insurers are getting the message,' he said.
The greatest growth areas for life reinsurers are critical illness policies,
private medical insurance coverage and long-term care policies for the
elderly.
'The state would like to withdraw from provision of benefits and the
insurers for the most part are happy to take up the role,' Mr Ludbrooke
said.
But selling these products to a wide portion of the population remains
problematic. 'Long term care in particular is a hard sell,' Mr Sansome said.
'We did some market research and found the demand was there until the price
was mentioned.'
The challenge for the life underwriters and their reinsurers is to find a
way to convince the public to buy an expensive product that they still
believe is a luxury and not a necessity.
'What is needed are tax breaks and there are no tax breaks although the
industry is working on it,' Mr Ludbrooke said.
For the reinsurers, one big difficulty remains assessing risk and setting
premiums. Since so many life offices rely on the reinsurers to set the rates
for them, the reinsurers are now in the position of having to conduct
sufficient research to enable them to price products appropriately.
'There is almost no data on which to base your premiums,' Mr Ludbrooke said.
The existing information on, say, critical illness experience, covers the
general population at large and is often too old or too limited to be of
much use. There are substantial statistical variations in life expectancy
and healthiness between non-insureds - who tend to be the unemployed and
less well-off - and the insured population.
Reinsurers believe that one of the best things which could happen to
non-death cover is that some of the nation's largest employers begin bolting
on to their pension plans options for that sort of provision. That would
give reinsurers the necessary data base to help them consider likely loss
experience and get the public acquainted with the merits of products such as
critical care cover.
Mr Ludbrooke suggests that leading schemes might wish to offer their members
an option of receiving a lower rate of pension while they are healthy with a
guarantee of critical care cover if they become ill. The willingness of
pension schemes to be more creative in their benefit offers would create a
pool by which underwriters could judge loss experience.
A 70 year-old seeking,say, a critical care or PHI policy, is a difficult
customer. Although the potential policyholder may have been subject to a
full medical examination, insurers do not know how to assess the findings.
'Is what the doctors have found comparable to what is normal in a 70-year
old?' Mr Sansome said. 'We don't know because we don't know what is
comparable in a 70 year-old.'
Meanwhile, the data so far suggest that, if anything, reinsurers and direct
insurers are underpricing their Permanent Health Insurance products as well
as their long-term and critical illness care products. 'We have wanted to
raise our PHI rates,' Mr Sansome said, noting that stiff competition was
preventing M&amp;G, the market leader in reinsuring that product, from doing so.
'It's not a market where you can dictate prices because there are other
competitors.'

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (8): The tax man cometh - Financial
products still sell despite tighter rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE demand for financial reinsurance is on the increase, there is also
greater regulatory concern over how it is being used.
Lloyd's is currently attempting to ring-fence its old year liabilities in a
specially created entity, NewCo. The exercise is like that of some financial
reinsurance products, aiming to stabilise the effect on current trading and
capital management of a past book of long-tail business while making full
use of the time value of money. The financial reinsurance jargon for this is
obtaining 'surplus relief'.
At the same time, the Serious Fraud Office is examining the use by
syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency of Time &amp; Distance
policies (T&amp;Ds), under which a predetermined set of payments exceeds premium
paid. Formally accepted in the UK as a reinsurance policy, T&amp;Ds are pure
funding instruments whose main function, according to the Institute of
Actuaries, 'is to avoid admitting that reserves have been discounted'.
The Inland Revenue permits T&amp;D premiums as a tax deduction, but also insists
that credit be taken for the full value of the policy immediately, creating
an apparent (but taxable) current year profit.
The Inland Revenue has been suspicious of Lloyd's funds flowing offshore for
over a decade since it put a stop to 'rollovers', reinsurance policies on
which one year's premium was the previous year's profit commission. This
enabled tax free funds to be built up offshore.
This is also the main aim of financial reinsurance, according to an Inland
Revenue/Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI) discussion paper on
equalisation reserves published last month, this time achieved by 'somewhat
artificial transactions to exploit loopholes in the accounting conventions'.
Prudential concerns like those concerning T&amp;Ds are also apparent: assets are
transferred beyond local jurisdiction, and there is a risk of distortion in
insurers' financial statements.
At its simplest, financial (or 'finite risk') reinsurance is a T&amp;D with
timing risk. Loss Portfolio Transfers (LPTs) enable an insurer to book a
current credit while reinsuring a block of old business. For the reinsurer,
they are almost risk-free, and they can be structured to operate much like a
rollover. LPTs may be useful in managing the run-off of a discontinued
account, but were also a popular method for US insurers to obtain 'surplus
relief', causing regulatory concern that a precarious financial position was
being disguised.
Prospective Aggregate Covers (PACs) are similar, but apply to business yet
to be written. These and the more sophisticated spread loss contracts are
intended to provide continuity of cover at a predetermined price. A further
development is experience funded accounts, where the reinsured has access to
an agreed credit as well as the current balance in the 'experience account'
which records the progress of the contract.
Spread loss and experience funded contracts have become increasingly common
in London, creating legitimate concerns by regulators about off balance
sheet underwriting losses.
In April 1991, the DTI reminded UK insurers that the Association of British
Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice indicated that reinsurance deals
where risk transfer was not significant should be accounted according to
'economic substance'.
The Accounting Standards Board is considering a regulation which would
strengthen this requirement (similar to the rule in Australia), an apparent
death sentence for the T&amp;D and transactions aimed at 'surplus relief', and
with potential implications for more sophisticated covers. UK insurers must
also record negative experience account balances as liabilities in their
1992 returns.
The EC Insurance Accounts Directive may help to clarify some of these issues
by outlawing implicit discounting, requiring separate identification of
reinsurance, assets and liabilities to be stated gross, and limitation of
provisions to a 'necessary' level.
US prudential concerns are identical to those in Europe. At the end of 1992,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB standard 113,
addressing transfer of risk among other reinsurance issues. This required
liabilities to be stated gross, reinsurance recoverables to be treated as
assets, reinsurance transactions of which the substance is not provision of
an indemnity (based on considerations such as risk transfer and the
reinsurer's risk of loss) to be accounted as a deposit, and enforced
separate accounting of provisions for the prospective and retrospective
elements of hybrid covers.
Most importantly, it forbade immediate recognition of a gain or loss from
any retrospective contract, which must now be spread over the term of the
policy. More recently, FASB, through its Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF),
issued new accounting rules affecting 'multiple-year retrospectively rated
reinsurance contracts'. These require ceding companies to record experience
account balances on such contracts as assets or (when negative) liabilities.
The EITF acted in response to concern by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) that following Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, insurers may
have placed underwriting losses off balance sheet by not recording negative
experience account balances in so-called funded catastrophe covers.
One company which has restated its 1992 results to take account of the task
force's recommendations is Phoenix Re, which had a funded catastrophe cover
with USF&amp;G. As a result, its 1992 operating loss increased from Dollars
50,000 to Dollars 3.68m, and its net premium income fell by 10.9 per cent to
Dollars 48.4m.
'The EITF conclusions eliminate many of the GAAP advantages of funding
property catastrophe losses through multi-year contracts,' says Mr Dan
Marren, president and chief executive officer of Commercial Risk
Re-Insurance Co, the financial reinsurance subsidiary of French reinsurer
SCOR. 'For property catastrophes, the incurred event becomes known and
losses are paid quickly, so there is no avoiding the asset or liability
issue,' he adds.
However, Mr Marren believes that multi-year arrangements continue to be
attractive for long-tail casualty business, for which losses are accrued on
an incurred but not reported (IBNR) basis and there is considerable
uncertainty in the estimates. According to Mr Marren, 'for casualty lines,
shared risk programmes provide an effective means to protect against adverse
loss development while allowing companies to benefit from favourable
development'.
Funded catastrophe covers, however, have been written less by specialist
financial reinsurers than by traditional reinsurers seeking new kinds of
business. Three years ago, Ms Maralyn Fichte, now vice president, insurance
derivatives, at Banker's Trust, criticised 'the bandwagon of funded
catastrophe reinsurance'. While buyers might use it on an opportunistic
basis, adoption by reinsurers of credit risk, sometimes with automatic
reinstatements doubling the exposure, 'could lead to a disaster,' she
suggested.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (10): Unorthodox duo's initiative -
Profile / how Centre Re acquired its dynamic reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRE RE has grown apace in 1993. The initial public offering in the US in
the spring and the new plans to launch a new catastrophe reinsurer in
Bermuda in the summer have underlined its reputation as one of the world's
most dynamic reinsurance companies.
The Bermuda-based company, controlled by Zurich Insurance, has shown an
impressive record of growth and profitability since its launch from scratch
in 1988. Premium income has increased from just Dollars 268m in 1989 to an
estimated Dollars 1.1bn in 1992. Profits amounted to Dollars 65.9m in 1992,
a 37 per cent increase compared with 1991, and representing a return on
equity of 12.7 per cent, and by mid-1993 the combined assets of the group
amounted to Dollars 4.5bn.
Since its initial capitalisation of Dollars 250m in 1988, assets have risen
on average by 63 per cent a year. But it is not just the speed and scale of
growth that marks off Centre Re from many of its competitors.
The company's founders - Mr Stephen Gluckstern, the chairman of Centre Re
Holdings, and Michael Palm, the executive vice-president who heads up the
Bermuda operations - are both in their early 40s and had had no experience
in the reinsurance industry before launching Centre Re. Indeed their
backgrounds are even more unorthodox that that. Both men have liberal arts
backgrounds - Palm did academic research in English Literature, specialising
in the work of the American poet Wallace Stevens, while Gluckstern is an
educationalist who researched pre-school influences on the ability of
children to learn.
They met for the first time - in 1976 - teaching English in
pre-revolutionary Iran. Ten years later - after business school and
beginning banking careers - the two teamed up again, at the Philadelphia
offices of Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group led by Warren Buffet.
Influenced by the climate of innovation in US finance during the 1980s, they
saw reinsurance as an underdeveloped part of the financial markets ripe for
new ideas. 'We wanted to take a more heavily financial approach to
insurance,' explains Palm. 'This was a sector with very substantial cash
flows which ought to have the same kind of stability and product
sophistication as is found in other financial services.'
'We wanted to focus on stability and long-term relationships instead of
cyclicality and ups and downs in pricing,' says Palm. The two men thought
the answer lay to some extent in a new kind of reinsurance contract. 'We
wanted to find an intersection between highly leveraged and highly risk
exposed business and what had been called financial reinsurance - closer to
a banking or funding deal than a traditional reinsurance contract,' he adds.
'We wanted to take a multi-year approach to insurance costs, taking
volatility out of year to year deals.'
The result was what Palm admits was seen as a very ambitious effort to raise
Dollars 250m to support a new reinsurer. Backing came from Kemper Re, a US
reinsurer, Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, JP Morgan,
the merchant bank, and, in particular, Zurich Insurance, which has
subsequently become a majority shareholder.
Launched in 1988, Centre Re began by specialising in what Palm calls
'retrospective' financial reinsurance deals covering what is known as
'timing' and 'interest rate risks' - the possibility that claims may emerge
faster than expected on a book of liability business, or that trends in
interest rates may reduce the value of funds available to meet known claims.
Palm and Gluckstern decided to locate in Bermuda because the territory's
regulators allow its insurers to count future investment income as part of
its funds to meet claims, essentially permitting companies to discount their
reserves.
'The US regulatory environment introduces many inefficiencies,' explains
Palm. 'Our goal to concentrate on the economics of a transaction not to do
business when they didn't make sense.' The regulatory framework also helped
Centre Re contain its costs. 'We don't need to get authorisation for each
separate line of business which we underwrite. We can move more quickly than
our competitors,' he explains.
Over the past five years the nature of business has changed, with the group
beginning to concentrate on more typical reinsurance risks. In 1992 only 10
per cent of reinsurance contracts underwritten by Centre Re are now
'retrospective', compared with 100 per cent in 1988. The trend will be
accentuated by changes in US accounting rules in early 1993, which remove
some of the advantages for ceding insurers of using financial reinsurance
deals. Meanwhile, Centre Re's commitment to compete in more orthodox markets
has been underlined by a decision to start a new catastrophe reinsurance
company.
Even so, despite the changed focus, several aspects of the company's
strategy and style are likely to remain distinctive. The way that Centre Re
analyses risks and underwrites its policies marks it off from some companies
in the industry, for example. Its staff of just over 100 includesat least 30
actuaries, who are adept at using mathematical models to assess risk. Barely
concealing his contempt for some of the underwriting practices of the
Lloyd's market in the late 1980s, Palm says: 'We don't believe in subjective
underwriting where you guess what the range is in which losses might fall.'
He insists that the company is conservative in its analysis and pricing of
risks. 'The history of the industry shows that the successful people have
taken a very conservative view. Things tend to turn out worse.' By
underwriting in this fashion Centre Re is able to assume more risk on its
own books and therefore has more influence in the marketplace. You don't
want to be a follower. It tends to underwrite 'lines' or shares of
individual risks of at least 50 per cent.
Centre Re also tends to favour longer-term relationships with its clients
with contracts stretching on average for between three and five years. In
1992 the company underwrote just 175 contracts, each of which had an average
reinsurance premium of Dollars 25m. These factors tend to mean that
retention rates are higher and costs are lower.
Above all Palm remains confident and observes that the reinsurance industry
as a whole seems to be following in Centre Re's footsteps, with better
pricing and terms in the market increasingly controlled by the industry's
financially stronger companies.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (9): To advise and to guide - Brokers
are being pushed in new directions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEE COPPACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reinsurance broker is becoming less a clearing house for capital and
capacity and more a professional adviser active in the development of the
market.
Clients demand more evidence of the broker's value than a promise to improve
on the rates, though the ability to find capacity at a reasonable price
remains important.
In a market where capacity is tight and solvency is a key issue, the broker
can provide a real service to the ceding insurer and also to the reinsurer
who is looking for catastrophe protection of its book. Those who do not are
likely to find their business dwindling in the face of competitive pressure.
Brokers compete with reinsurers for business. Ceding insurers do not have to
use a broker; traditionally the professional reinsurance companies, mainly
based in continental Europe, have written most of their business directly.
One of the main reasons has been their close relationship with their
domestic, direct insurance market.
Dieter Losse, chairman and chief executive of the respected international
reinsurance broker Greig Fester, said: 'The serious brokers are all clear
that they can only justify their position in the chain if they are genuinely
adding value.'
In territories, such as the UK, which are broker markets, the reinsurers
have been happy to take business from brokers with the proviso that the
broker must not block the relationship between the direct insurer and the
reinsurer. Reinsurers are increasingly insisting on knowing just what risks
they are taking. Cedants have to submit to scrutiny or they find themselves
short of reinsurance, according to European insurance analyst Tim Dawson at
Lehman Brothers in London. 'The flight to quality works both ways.
Reinsurers can pick and choose from which insurers they want to accept
business.'
Michael White, deputy chairman of international reinsurance at Willis
Corroon, also says that over the last two or three years brokers have had to
spend far more time on renewal analysing the business and objectives of the
cedant and discussing the best approaches to the business. Clients and
potential clients demand more evidence of the broker's value than a promise
to improve on the rates.
One way that brokers have been enhancing their value to cedants has been
through the development of research and analytical tools to help them
understand the implications of what they have been writing in terms of
catastrophe exposures, the geographical spread of their book in terms of
perceived natural hazards.
Explained Dieter Losse: 'The broker is in a unique position to help the
insurer understand the nature of their exposures from the reinsurance
perspective, particularly in a hard market, and advise on a range of
options.'
In addition to preparing and placing programmes, brokers may handle claims
and help prepare documentation in response to the reinsurers' requirements
for increased information. They also monitor the solvency of reinsurers and
reinsurance markets.
The need for specialist skills is increasing reflected in the results of
firms such as Greig Fester and another London based international
reinsurance broker, the Benfield Group. Since 1988, Greig Fester's turnover
has risen from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 42.8m at the end of 1992. Benfield,
which is an excess of loss specialist, nearly tripled its turnover between
1990 and June 1992 with a rise from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 39.8m.
Benfield, under its chairman Matthew Harding, plays an active role in
developing the excess of loss market since the demise of the notorious LMX,
or London market spiral. For example, it insists that the ceding insurer
takes a co-insurance of at least 10 perent of any programme. In this way,
Matthew Harding believes, the direct insurer retains an interest in keeping
claims down, which in turn pleases the reinsurer and promotes a good, long
term relationship.
And against the trend of brokers distancing themselves from underwriting
activities, Benfield has now announced that, subject to approval from the
Department of Trade and Industry, it will set up a UK based excess of loss
reinsurer. The new company will have fully paid up capital of Pounds 50m
(Dollars 75m) and is intended to begin underwriting effect from January 1,
1994.
No other details have yet been released, but it seems almost certain that
the co-insurance principle that Benfield applies to its brokered programmes
will be a fundamental part of the new company's underwriting policy.
Direct insurers also look to their reinsurance brokers to help in analysing
security, particularly in a hard market when they may not be able to get all
the capacity they want from their traditional sources, reinsurers.
Solvency is a considerable worry, following the collapse of once important
London market firms and problems in the Scandinavian market. New capital has
been coming into the reinsurance market, but its willingness to provide
continuity is untested.
Faced with an insolvent reinsurer, the broker not only has an unhappy
client, for whom finding replacement cover may be difficult in a hard
market, but it also faces an administrative headache. The London market
system of 'net accounting', which is highly convenient when all the parties
are solvent, is a source of major problems for the broker if one of them
fails.
Leading insolvency counsel Gabriel Moss QC explains that typically the
broker acts as a 'clearing house' for payments between insurers and
reinsurers.
However, in an insolvency, only the principals to the contract, the insurer
and reinsurer, are permitted to set-off the amounts they have outstanding
with each other. The broker's standing effectively vanishes.
Increased expectations from clients coupled with competition for scarce
reinsurance capacity is putting pressure on the skills of brokers and
further rationalisation is likely in the London market. Although there is no
register of reinsurance brokers as such, the fall in the number of Lloyd's
brokers to 218 with 42 resignations and only five admissions last year is
likely to indicate the trend. Those who can offer the expertise will play an
essential role maintaining the reinsurance market.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (6): Environmental time-bombs - Chris
Clark on liability for injuries caused by delayed-action pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOT attention is being paid to a series of judgments handed down by the
supreme judicial court in France, the Cour de Cassation, in December 1990.
In these, the court effectively outlawed 'claims-made' policy wordings which
liability insurers now rely upon to manage their exposure to claims from the
past.
Under a claims-made policy, the policyholder is covered only for claims
submitted during the policy period. Under earlier 'occurrence based'
policies, the cover remained open into the future for claims arising from
events that occurred during the policy period, but whose consequences were
discovered years later, such as asbestos bodily injury, latent defects in
buildings and gradual pollution.
The claims-made form, as similar policy wordings based on manifestation or
discovery of harm, allow insurers and reinsurers much more control over the
size of outstanding liabilities at the end of each underwriting year.
In 1990, the French court ruled, on the grounds of consumer protection, that
such policy restrictions imposed an unfair burden on the insured and that,
regardless of the wordings included in an insurance contract, the policy
holder would be entitled to cover on the basis of the original act causing
the harm ('fait generateur'), which insurers see as an even wider trigger
than occurrence wordings.
Initially, French insurers thought that the ruling was confined to a narrow
class of business relating to the construction industry, but the court seems
determined to apply its decision to all liability insurance. To add to these
worries, similar developments have since occurred in Belgium and Spain, the
first under an article in a non-marine insurance contract law passed in June
1992, and the second following Spanish supreme court judgments in 1991 and
1992 concerning medical liability policies. In each case, claims-made policy
wordings were deemed unfairly restrictive on the policyholder.
Because of past experience with long-tail liabilities, most insurers today
are unwilling to write liability insurance on an occurrence or similar
basis. They simply do not know how to set realistic premiums for such wide
exposure to unpredictable risks. These rulings therefore pose a fundamental
threat.
There are some signs that regulatory authorities in Belgium and Spain
recognise that something needs to be done to stop liability insurance drying
up altogether in their countries, but both insurers and reinsurers remain
extremely concerned about the French position, according to Mathias Schubert
of Cologne Re.
Everyone is hoping that French legislators will do something to correct the
situation. If they do not, there is a real danger of leading insurers and
reinsurers pulling out of the French liability market, although at present
insurers are continuing to write claims-made policies on the understanding
that policyholders will not attempt to enforce the supreme court judgment.
Juerg Spuehler of Swiss Re believes that much of the difficulty here is
based on misunderstanding of the claims-made principle. Far from penalising
the insured, he argues, claims-made wordings simply move claims to a
different policy, which is in fact a more favourable one for the
policyholder.
Claims that, on an occurrence basis, would have had to be attached to old
policies, written many years in the past, under claims-made now trigger
today's policy, which is likely to have much higher policy limits and is
less likely to have been partially exhausted by previous claims for general
liability or product liability losses.
The insured therefore benefits, rather than suffers, under the claims-made
form and Mr Spuehler feels that it is essential that insurers and reinsurers
take the time to clarify this with regulators and others who fail to
appreciate it.
Apart from this issue, environmental liability continues to worry almost
everyone, in two forms: the overhang of exposure to claims from past
pollution and the development of an effective insurance market for the
future. On the historic backlog of pollution incidents, those who wrote
general public liability policies over the last 30 years or so are to some
extent holding their breath.
As governments progressively insist that such pollution is cleaned up, often
to expensive standards, the parties responsible for clean up are digging out
their old liability insurance policies to see if they offer any cover, with
a growing community of insurance 'archaeology' companies on hand to help
them.
So far, most of this has been taking place in North America, where US
environmental regulation imposes strict, joint and several, and effectively
retroactive liability for problems like contaminated land and groundwater.
Under a tidal wave of multi-million dollar claims, US courts separately in
each state have a queue of legal cases outstanding in which insurance
companies are attempting to resist claims for gradual, or intentional,
pollution.
European policies have yet to come under this pressure, largely because
policyholders have not yet had to pay out much on environmental clean up.
Some policyholder lawyers believe that, as environmental regulations
tighten, past policy wordings in Europe will be just as vulnerable to claims
as their US counterparts. Other people foresee greater difficulties for
policyholders here, because European courts tend to reach more restrictive
judgments on commercial law.
With this past experience, many insurers want to have as little as possible
to do with future environmental liability. From 1986, all pollution risks
have been excluded from general liability policies in the US, while in
Europe the partial, 'sudden and accidental' exclusions have mostly been
introduced more recently.
For wider cover, insurance market pools in France, the Netherlands, Italy
and Denmark, and individual insurers elsewhere are offering specialised
environmental impairment and other pollution liability policies (loosely
known as EIL), which use claims-made wordings and require detailed site
inspections before cover is offered.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (7): Crumbling monoliths offer new
opportunities - As centralised control is swept away, Latin America and the
ex-Soviet bloc become expanding markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A time when global reinsurance capacity has been contracting at record
speed, in Latin America and the former Soviet bloc relaxation of state
control over the insurance industry is eroding the domination of
nationalised reinsurers.
Most of Latin America, including the most attractive markets, is opening to
foreign direct investment in insurance, as is central Europe, while most of
eastern Europe has seen a rapid increase in new insurers with domestic or
joint venture capital.
For the economies of Latin America, the 1980s was 'The Lost Decade'
afflicted by political instability, high inflation, capital flight and the
burden of debt service. International financial institutions are now
prepared to invest once again.
In the north, Mexico will become even more attractive with the passage of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), while in the south economic
integration is being fostered through Mercosur, the planned common market
linking Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Mercosur will eventually introduce freedom of insurance services, creating
indigenous impetus for the dissolution of the still-monopolised Brazilian
and Uruguayan reinsurance markets. Argentina has abolished its state
reinsurance monopoly, as Chile did at the beginning of the 1980s.
Other measures of market deregulation have been implemented in, for example,
Colombia and Peru, and also in Brazil, where last month a board for the
first time made up of professional insurers rather than purely political
nominees was appointed to the monopoly IRB. In Venezuela, measures to open
up the market have been delayed by political instability.
Mr Egbert Willam, board member responsible for the region at Cologne Re,
says that 'As a reinsurer, we now have many things we could wish for. We
think it represents an opportunity for us.'
A measure of the degree of underlying change is the fact that only two or
three years ago Cologne Re was considering withdrawing from the region, but
this December will establish a new operation in Buenos Aires to service the
Southern Cone.
At the end of July, Transatlantic Reinsurance Co announced the formation of
a new division in Miami to underwrite Latin American business. While the
number of direct insurers operating will decline, those which remain will be
financially stronger and technically more sophisticated and demanding, the
divisional head Javier Vigil says. He adds that as a new entrant to the
market unburdened by the effects of past losses, Transatlantic aims to be 'a
premier player in Latin America' beyond the year 2000.
It is not a reinsurer's Eldorado, however. A prime concern is catastrophe
exposure, particularly in the north which is subject both to earthquake and
windstorm. In August last year, Cologne Re advised its clients that it would
cease providing catastrophe cover on a proportional basis by 1997. 'A
non-proportional basis is the only reasonable way to reinsure catastrophes,'
Mr Willam comments.
Mr Georg Daschner, deputy executive manager with responsibility for the
region at leading provider Munich Re, expresses similar concerns regarding
catastrophe exposure and points out that deregulation does not bring
automatic benefits.
In Chile, when tariffs were freed along with the abolition of the
reinsurance monopoly, 'many reinsurers only saw the fantastic statistics,
thought the market must be sound, and offered high levels of capacity and
commissions,' he recalls. As competition, premium levels plummeted and fear
of competition delayed the required underwriting adjustments.
Reinsurance market conditions are not conducive to an exact repetition of
that scenario, but Mr Daschner warns that the freeing of tariffs and
controls on policy conditions has also led to a collapse in original premium
levels in Colombia and Mexico, for example.
The inadequacy of property insurance rates becomes particularly apparent, he
adds, when the portion to cover earthquake is removed. 'We need to separate
this price out,' he emphasises, so that a premium commensurate with the risk
can be obtained by reinsurers.
For the next renewals, Munich Re will demand additional measures to be taken
to limit further accumulated liabilities from natural perils and to increase
the respective reinsurance prices. The company will maintain its close but
cautious relationship with the region, working together with those companies
which it believes can underwrite on a proper technical basis and are
interested in a long-term link, Mr Daschner says.
Eastern European state insurers always placed substantial volumes of marine
and aviation business, as well as hard currency property risks, in the
international market. In much of both regions, there is a shortage of
experienced underwriting staff, the former because insurers were few, the
latter because they were many but effectively insulated from technical
decisions by set tariffs and compulsory cessions.
In the past, developing insurance markets with a shortage of local capital
such as eastern Europe have been able to rely upon proportional reinsurance
support, now in short supply while non-proportional cover is expensive.
Subsidiaries of major western insurers or joint ventures - Allianz,
Generali, AIG and Alte Leipziger are among the most active - can rely on
their parents and their existing relationships with leading reinsurers.
Others buy such protection as they can afford and run the remainder on a net
basis. In Poland, which has a comparatively large number of small insurers,
co-insurance is developing, and a new local reinsurer is being formed by
market leader PZU, which is awaiting privatisation.
The problem of reinsurance is greatest in the former USSR. Russia has well
over 1,000 new insurers, most of them already licensed, who are nowadays
trying to cover their rouble reinsurance requirements on the local market.
Ingosstrakh, the former Soviet hard currency insurer, provides some, as do
the now emerging new local reinsurance companies all over the country.
Cologne Re (which also owns 10 per cent of the largest Russian
privately-owned insurer, ASKO), and Munich Re also do so selectively,
although both are more active in providing the markets of the former USSR
with scarce hard currency reinsurance.
An area in which reinsurance support has had important local impact is in
cover for motorists abroad. Uniquely in Europe, states of the former USSR
(with the exception of Estonia) have no motor liability insurance
legislation, and have been unable to join the Green Card system.
French market leader UAP reinsures Green Cards underwritten by PZU which are
marketed by the state insurers of Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus, as well
as by private sector insurers in Estonia. Last month UAP and its partners,
together with Polish broker Grupa Polska, opened a motor claims bureau in
Warsaw.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (5): Natural disasters multiply -
Global warming makes insurers sweat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANNESSA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE scope and frequency of claims due to natural catastrophes has risen
drastically over recent decades leading to unprecedented losses for insurers
and reinsurers alike.
The trend was highlighted by Swiss Re in Sigma, its monthly review of
reinsurance developments. Its review of catastrophe and other major losses
in 1992 shows that natural disasters again dominated the year with a record
130 events resulting in an insured loss of Dollars 22.5bn, up 108 per cent
on the previous year's figure.
Nor was the long-term comparison any healthier. Loss figures have remained
high for the last four years while average losses rose alarmingly.
From 1970 to 1981 the insured loss per catastrophic event averaged Dollars
84m (1992 prices). Between 1982 and 1991, however, the figure rose Dollars
132.8m. Swiss Re concluded that economic factors were responsible for only a
small proportion of the losses: GNP increased by 85 per cent over the last
23 years, while insured losses increased by over 900 per cent.
Others factors, including the settlement and industrialisation of vulnerable
areas and an increase in insurance density were no less important and may
gain further significance. This applied especially to climatic conditions
'since it appears quite likely that the loss surge is at least in part due
to climatic change ..'
Sigma says that its statistics do not tell us precisely 'how or why mankind
aggravates catastrophe risks or allows them to become worse ..' but that
they 'do clearly indicate that risks are increasing; they give us the urgent
warning to examine the causes of these trends and to develop effective
preventive strategies.'
Research by Munich Re has highlighted 'already disturbing signs of the
worldwide warming of the atmosphere'. For example, 1990 was the warmest year
since meteorological records began, and six of the last 10 years have seen
global temperatures higher than all previous readings.
Current information, seems to point to a global rise in temperature of
between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees by the end of the next century. Assuming that
all the predicted effects of the man-made greenhouse effect become reality,
just what will mankind be up against? Munich Re assumes the following line
of development:
A warmer atmosphere would result in a greater exchange of energy adding to
the momentum of vertical exchange processes which are the driving force in
the development of tropical cyclones, tornadoes and thunderstorms resulting
in increased frequency and strength.
More severe winter storms in Europe similar to those in late January and
March 1990 which resulted in an insured loss of DM17.3bn are feasible.
Increased exposure to storm surges and flooding in low-lying,
densely-populated regions such as Bangladesh, because of a 30cm-100cm rise
in sea levels within 100 years.
The jury has still not reached its verdict on global warming. However, most
of its members would probably support the view expressed by Swiss Re in its
1990 annual report that 'reinsurers cannot afford to wait for scientists to
provide evidence of how climatic change will influence natural events such
as storm, hail and flooding and so on. Underwriting policy and commitment
acceptance must be adjusted now to possible future developments.'
But just how can the insurance and reinsurance industry cope with the
increased loss potential of natural catastrophes?
Munich Re believes that industry can either adjust to the situation or
minimise or prevent the effects and suggests a number of instruments that
the risk community has at its disposal including:
Charging premiums commensurate with risk, which would mean breaking down the
product into its constituent parts and calculating the risk premium for each
peril that could impact on an account. It should be kept in mind that
historical return periods for these perils may well have been altered by
global warming. The challenge for reinsurers is to provide cover at rates
that not only reflect the past, but to set prices which anticipate future
loss. Substantial deductibles and insurance participation by the insured.
Munich Re demonstrates the effectiveness of a deductible in its study 1990
Winter Storms in Europe, illustrating how a deductible of DM500 on a German
homeowners' comprehensive policy would have reduced aggregate insured losses
by 30 per cent and the number of insured losses by 40 pr cent.
Liability limits per loss event or area with those liabilities rendered
transparent by determining accumulation.
Limits on cover or exclusions for certain hazards.
Loss prevention through policyholder education about measures which may
bring about a reduction in weather damage claims.
Optimal loss settlement.
Munich Re maintains that the effects of climatic change need not have a
negative impact as long as the above disciplines are introduced. However,
clients of insurers and reinsurers would have to be aware of environmental
changes to motivate them to take suitable countermeasures such as
participation in the United Nations International Decade of Natural Disaster
Reduction aimed at combating the increased danger of natural disasters or
ratification of the World Climate Convention.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (4): The big one that missed Miami -
Hurricance Andrew was bad but it could have cost a lot more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HURRICANE Andrew, the biggest ever US catastrophe loss was bad
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but it could have been much worse. Had Andrew hit Miami last August instead
of less built-up areas of Florida and Louisiana, the damage would have been
much greater than the Dollars 15.5bn in losses the storm actually caused.
Even so the impact of the hurricane on the local reinsurance market, which
contributed to Dollars 22.97bn in catastrophe losses for the year as a
whole, has been stark.
Last year's losses have depressed industry profitability and put many
smaller and medium-sized reinsurers under further financial strain leading
many to reduce their involvement in the market and a decline in capacity,
with the resulting fall in capacity forcing a sharp increases in prices.
The scale of the hurricane has also served to highlight a longer term trend
in which catastrophe losses are becoming bigger and more frequent. Losses
from catastrophes rose steadily during the 1980s with the annual toll
reaching Dollars 2.3bn in 1983, Dollars 2.8bn in 1985 and Dollars 7.6bn in
1989, when claims from hurricane Hugo alone amounted to Dollars 4.2bn.
During 1990 and 1991 losses stayed at a high level, amounting to Dollars
2.82bn and Dollars 4.72bn respectively.
Figures for the first three months from Property Claims Services, the body
which collates data for the industry, indicate that the trend is continuing.
Anticipated claims for the first quarter amounted to Dollars 2.8bn. The bulk
of the first quarter loss was provided by a large storm which hit 24
southern and eastern states between 11 and 14 March. Claims from the World
Trade Center bombing on 26 February amount to more than Dollars 510m. 'The
industry has to accept that the traditional pattern of periods of low loss
frequency punctuated by the occasional bad year is no longer applicable,'
commented the specialist newsletter Catastrophe Reinsurance.
Rates have risen sharply. Reinsurance premiums which were moving gently
upwards at last year's mid-year renewals rose sharply at the end of the year
and have climbed higher again this year, bringing the US firmly into line
with the hardening market in Europe and elsewhere.
Increases of rates ranged from 10 per cent to 100 per cent on January 1993
renewals. Further tightness, especially in the property market, was evident
at mid-year renewals. The terms and conditions of many reinsurance policies
sold to US buyers have tightened.
According to Mr Alan Cranfield, reinsurance broker with Alexander Howden,
pro-rata reinsurance treaties bought by US companies are now much more
likely to include caps on the catastrophe exposures that they cover. Mr
Cranfield said that 90 per cent of such policies included caps at the the
mid-year renewals, compared with 70 per cent at the end of last year.
Reinsurers are also more likely to insist that insurers agree to accept
bigger deductibles, retaining more of their risks on their own books. This
in turn is prompting many insurers to reduce the amount of cover they offer
to their own policyholders, especially in areas highly exposed to
catastrophe risks such as coastal Florida.
In the longer term the trends seem certain to put many smaller reinsurance
companies under increasing financial pressure, leading to a further
consolidation in the market.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, says that 1992 losses drove up the
industry's combined ratio (expenses plus claims against premiums) to 118.2
per cent compared with 106.3 per cent in 1991, leading to a sharp depression
in profitability.
In spite of its capital gains of more than Dollars 870m, the earnings of the
US reinsurance industry plummeted during 1992. Profitability as measured by
return on revenue dropped 10 percentage points to 2.88 per cent in 1992 from
12.95 per cent in 1991. The industry's pre-tax profits declined by 51 per
cent to Dollars 963m compared with Dollars 2bn in 1991, while profits - as
measured by return on equity - fell by 747 basis points to 6.34 per cent in
1992. Excluding realised gains it fell to 0.59 per cent.
S &amp; P's figures show that the industry's better capitalised reinsurers have
fared better than their weaker rivals, generally posting better results.
'Simply put, larger well-capitalised reinsurers are in a better position to
withstand such devastating losses,' say Thomas Walsh and Mary Ann Gangemi,
of Standard &amp; Poor's.
Financially stronger well positioned reinsurers have been able to 'cherry
pick' books of business from both primary companies looking to leave the
reinsurance business and professional reinsurers who have lost market share
or status.
The top 10 reinsurers' increased their market share to 57 per cent in 1992,
compared with 44 per cent in 1985 and 53 per cent in 1991, say S &amp; P. The
top 20 reinsurers are responsible for more than 75 per cent of net premiums
written. Beyond the top 20 almost 90 per cent of premiums are underwritten
by only 35 companies.
'The consolidation process, accelerated by the most recent string of
catastrophes, is expected to continue as many of the smaller firms
deteriorate financially due to the less profitable business written in
recent years,' say S &amp; P's Walsh and Gangemi.
'These losses will require further loss reserve strengthening which for some
will create unbearable pressure on an already fragile capital base,' the two
analysts add.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (3): Man-made hurricanes - Europeans
foot the bill for the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE early 1990s have witnessed the culmination of a series of adverse trends
in Europe's primary insurance industry which had their roots in the dynamic
financial markets and striving for international expansion in the mid-1980s.
In 1985, non-life reinsurers were publicly expressing anxiety mainly about
US liability business. By 1987, other concerns were coming more to the fore.
Munich Re, for example, noted 'the far-reaching consequences' of retention
of a greater share of risk both by commercial insureds and insurers.
Netherlands Reinsurance Group (NRG) commented that the resulting shift of
emphasis towards catastrophe cover would lead to 'increasingly unbalanced'
reinsurance portfolios and even greater volatility of results, which could
only be evened out if 'an adequate price is charged'.
At the same time, Swiss Re was observing 'the first effects of the EC 1992
project' in the shape of intensified competition, particularly for
industrial risks. This was precisely the area of business 'which has
repeatedly brought unsatisfactory results for years'. Munich Re, meanwhile,
had for years been criticising 'structural deficiencies' in the European
industrial fire market.
By 1988-89, Swiss Re was expressing concern over possible accumulations of
risk generated by restructuring of the primary insurance market, as well as
criticising 'blatant' underpricing in some areas.
The 1990 winter storms in Europe prompted it to call for 'fair distribution'
of catastrophe losses between reinsurer, insurer and policyholder.
Swiss Re is now addressing the twin problems of inadequate underlying
property rates and instability in prediction of natural catastrophe losses.
At the end of August, it announced that it planned to invest Dollars 100m
and to take a leading technical role in Partner Re, a new specialist
catastrophe reinsurer based in Bermuda.
'Industrial fire and property has been extremely bad also on a per risk
basis, especially in Europe, and especially in France and Germany,' says
general manager Walter Kielholz, whose company is 'trying very hard - I
can't put it otherwise - to pressure our clients into doing something about
it'.
'We are assisted in this by the prohibition of cross-subsidising of personal
and commercial lines,' he adds. But he sees a potential danger in the
impending liberalisation of all European Community markets. 'All our
experience of markets which liberalise indicates that rates tend not to go
up,' he comments.
Reinsurers can either reduce their support or toughen conditions, but in Mr
Kielholz's view some restructuring of the business itself is necessary. For
example, in continental Europe there has been a tendency not to encourage
industrial clients to take large deductibles, which are sometimes so low as
to be 'quite ridiculous'. He attributes this largely to distribution
networks focused on premium volume.
Each part of the business, he says, must be examined on a stand-alone basis
so that no client segment or class of business subsidises another. The
problem with a 'whole account' view was that it made it impossible to set
funds aside for very risky business.
'If the original business cannot be cured, an unhooking of the reinsurance
terms of trade from the original terms of trade is unavoidable,' he
concludes.
'Especially in areas of high risk, you have to have an absolute level of
control,' comments John Dowling, managing director of Eagle Star Re, one of
few remaining providers of significant proportional capacity in London.
Last year, with numbers of reinsurers withdrawing or heavily restricting
operations, the bargaining position of those remaining was strengthened,
particularly as catastrophes had ended the reinsurance spiral in which
participants earned a precarious living by 'taking in each other's laundry'.
In August, Cologne Re told clients that over the next five years it would
cease providing cover for catastrophe on a proportional basis.
In October, the UK market was notified by European reinsurers that cover for
damage from terrorist attack would no longer be included free in property
reinsurances. Munich Re, again, had been warning of the implications of
increasing political risk for property insurance for years.
In its 1993 annual catastrophe review, it stated that wherever there is a
risk of large losses, reinsurers must obtain in full a margin sufficient to
pay them 'irrespective of whether the original rates charged by their
reinsured clients provide these margins or not'.
Furthermore, account must be taken not only of past losses, but of the risk
that future catastrophe costs may be higher still.
The same argument applies to proportional business. With original prices so
low that they are often barely sufficient to pay for a medium-sized fire
claim, 'reinsurers are in effect covering major fire losses free of charge,
not to mention natural catastrophe losses,' says Munich Re management board
member Fedor Nierhaus.
Munich Re will no longer follow inadequate original prices, and will also
set limits on catastrophe exposure in proportional contracts, which Mr
Nierhaus describes as 'a matter of fundamental importance.' Such caps have
suddenly become the rule rather than the exception in the US.
Serge Osouf, president, reinsurance operations, of the French SCOR group,
says 'we decided to show the market that enough was enough'. SCOR's accounts
are probably the most transparent of any European reinsurer, with major
losses - and any subsequent recovery - shown more quickly than by its
competitors.
'We have to replenish and increase our catastrophe reserves, and therefore
we need better margins,' he says. SCOR group companies too will emphasise
non-proportional and facultative business, but will renew proportional on a
selected basis after careful review of catastrophe accumulations.
'We will co-operate with all clients who are prepared also to share their
good results,' he adds.
Perhaps the most radical step, however, was that taken by NRG. It announced
its complete withdrawal from non-life reinsurance in March afterobserving
that 'the vagaries of the American tort system  .. exploited by a surfeit of
plaintiff lawyers make it virtually impossible to transact liability
business on a profitable basis.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (2): Recovery in the ruins - London's
outlook is not as bad as it seems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMID the bomb debris and 'To Let' signs littering Fenchurch and Leadenhall
Street it is only too easy to form the impression that London's insurance
market is in terminal decline.
Indeed in the spring of this year news of reinsurance company withdrawals
and a continual stream of disaster and scandal at the Lloyd's markets
combined to create a mood of near despair among professionals about the
fortunes of the market.
Six months later the picture is a good deal brighter. Reinsurance rates are
still rising, the weather in the Caribbean and Europe has - at least until
the end of August - been kinder to reinsurers, and the market has been
buoyed by higher than expected investor interest in new reinsurance ventures
both at Lloyd's and in the company market.
London's problems began when a series of catastrophe losses squeezed between
the two European storms of October 1987 and January 1990 hit the highly
specialist market for retrocessional cover. At a time when the market was
introducing new technology to speed up claims payments, the combination of
both the number and scale of the losses eventually overwhelmed lead
underwriters backed by Lloyd's agencies such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim,
Devonshire, Rose Thompson Young and Bromley.
Syndicates such as 290 and 540/42 made losses in 1989 and 1990 which
exceeded their total capacity by more than 200 per cent, leaving their Names
with unsustainable losses and a tangle of litigation. Losses at Gooda
Walker's seven syndicates - three of which were regarded as leaders in the
'spiral' market - are expected to exceed Pounds 1bn, about a sixth of
Lloyd's total losses in the last five years. Even underwriters such as Mr
David King, whose syndicate 745 was popular among professionals, has been
driven out of business by the losses.
The number of syndicates fell from just over 400 in 1990 to 228 in 1993,
with a fall to fewer than 200 forecast for 1994. Syndicates which had
occupied four of the Lloyd's building's trading floors in 1989 were
accommodated on only two floors this year.
London-based reinsurance companies were hit in less spectacular fashion but
in some cases the damage was sufficient to force withdrawals from the
market. Mercantile &amp; General Re, the subsidiary of the Prudential
Corporation, was so badly affected by claims from the Piper Alpha oil rig
explosion in July 1988 that it first markedly reduced its exposure to
general reinsurance business, and then in 1993 announced its decision to
concentrate on life reinsurance.
A second wave of losses in 1991 and 1992, culminating in hurricane Andrew -
the US's biggest ever catastrophe loss - damaged a number of companies
specialising in direct reinsurance, leading earlier this year to the
decision by market leaders such as English &amp; American, Norwich Winterthur (a
joint venture backed by Norwich Union, Winterthur and Chiyoda of Japan) and
NRG, the subsidiary of the Netherlands' biggest insurance company,
Internationale Nederlande Groep, to leave the market.
Mr Willem Dikland, chief executive of NRG, explained that reinsurance did
not offer 'a sufficient return on capital. Catastrophes are getting bigger.
You cannot get any retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) protection, and
original rates, especially in France and Germany, are totally inadequate.'
At least a dozen companies, some of whom such as Chancellor had an extensive
involvement in the reinsurance and retrocession markets, have gone into
liquidation. More generally the scale of losses and obvious volatility of
the market led to the withdrawal of companies such as Royal Re, the
subsidiary of Royal Insurance.
Moreover, the problems of many Lloyd's syndicates and smaller reinsurance
companies have heightened fears about reinsurance security. Increasingly
brokers have shied away from placing business with reinsurers who have less
than Pounds 50m in capital.
At the same time the greater preparedness of brokers to place business
directly with large European companies in their home offices has also
weakened London's position. And stung by heavy losses themselves many
European companies have become much more concerned to exercise more direct
control over the business they write.
In a significant development in June Munich Re announced that it was
downgrading its London office. A notice to brokers issued on 30 June said
that the company's previous policy in which international treaty business
had been underwritten in London 'had lead to accumulations which have to be
more tightly and centrally controlled'. In future international treaties
would be underwritten either in the Munich home office or in Munich Re's
local subsidiaries and branches in the respective markets, it added.
Yet in recent months there have been initial indications of a slow recovery
in London's fortunes. Rates for almost all reinsurance policies have
increased to more adequate levels, increasing the prospects of a return to
profitability. The Lloyd's business plan, published in April, highlighted a
sharp rise in reinsurance rates between 1989 and 1993 and a big increase in
the size of deductibles that buyers are being forced to accept (see graph).
During the summer there have been a number of new investments.
NAC Re, the eighth largest US reinsurance company, injected Pounds 50m into
a London reinsurance subsidiary in June, after recruiting Mr Charles Catt
from NWRe to head up the office.
Liberty Mutual, a Boston-based insurer, also announced in June that it
intends to invest Pounds 85m in its London market subsidiary. The investment
increased paid-up capital of the company from Pounds 15m to Pounds 100m.
Liberty had earlier recruited Mr Dick Hazell, the former deputy chairman of
Lloyd's of London, as the chairman of its London subsidiary.
Mr David Holmes, of the London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association
(LIRMA), says his organisation, which represents the London reinsurance
community, has received a number of other inquiries especially from US
companies.
In August Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, announced
it was converting its London market division into a fully fledged marine and
reinsurance company, with a dedicated capital of Pounds 125m.
In August it also emerged that the Benfield Group, a broker, which
specialises in high level excess of loss market, was intended to form a new
reinsurance company, with paid-up capital of some Pounds 50m.
There has also been higher than expected investor interest among UK and US
financial institutions in the efforts of Lloyd's of London to attract
corporate capital to its market. At least some of this capital - which could
amount to Pounds 500m according to some early indications  - will be
channelled into the reinsurance market.
Sentiment was also boosted in July by the government's decision to allow
companies to establish tax free catastrophe reserves for the first time. The
changes were outlined in consultation document issued by the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue and published in July.
Even so investor interest in London is dwarfed by recent developments in the
Bermudian marketplace, where more than Dollars 1bn in fresh capital was
pledged in the summer. At present underwriters of the new Bermudian
companies are currently content to underwrite so-called 'following' lines on
policies whose price, terms and conditions are decided by 'lead'
underwriters in London.
Yet as their confidence grows the new Bermudian companies may soon start to
seek to lead business themselves, posing a potentially serious competitive
threat. The London market will need to consolidate its recent recovery if it
is to defend its position successfully.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (1): Reaping the whirlwinds - New
capital is flowing into the reinsurance industry, writes Richard Lapper. But
as the markets absorb the cost of a series of recent largescale disasters,
they are under continued pressure to raise premiums and to limit the scope
of cover

AS REINSURERS MEET in Monte Carlo today for their annual rendezvous,
investors are showing an almost feverish interest in their industry.
Yet in spite of the flow of new capital into the catastrophe market in
Bermuda and to a lesser extent in London, international markets are still
short of capacity, following the increase in both the number and scale of
catastrophe losses in recent years.
Bermuda has been the biggest beneficiary of the surge in investor interest,
with more than half a dozen new companies, specialising in catastrophe
reinsurance, choosing to base themselves on the island in recent months. The
biggest new venture is a company, called Partner Reinsurance, launched a
week ago by Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer, John Head, the
US investor, and other institutional investors.
The three original shareholders have invested Dollars 255m and intend to
raise a further Dollars 500m from US, European and Japanese equity markets.
Mr Walter Kielholz, a director of Swiss Re, said the aim of the project was
to 'generate as much new capacity as possible'.
Earlier this summer investors - ranging from insurers and reinsurers such as
American International Group, General Re and USF &amp; G, brokers such as
Johnson &amp; Higgins and financial houses such as Goldman Sachs - announced
backing for four separate ventures with a combined capital of more than
Dollars 1bn.
The biggest of these - Tempest Reinsurance - is expected to have up to
Dollars 500m in capital, while International Property Catastrophe
Reinsurance Co, backed by AIG and others, is capitalised at Dollars 300m. In
another move Mid-Ocean, a venture started by Marsh McLennan and JP Morgan
last year with capital of Dollars 350m, raised a further Dollars 250m
through an initial public offering in New York. Separately it emerged in
August that both SCOR, the French reinsurer, and Centre Re, now controlled
by Switzerland's Zurich Insurance, are both considering new Bermuda-based
catastrophe reinsurance subsidiaries.
In London, two US insurance companies have announced plans to launch new
subsidiaries, dedicated to the catastrophe reinsurance market, while
Benfield Group, a fast growing reinsurance broker, is expected to launch a
new reinsurance company in the autumn with about Pounds 50m in capital,
while Australian investors are preparing to inject ADollars 300m into a new
Sydney-based facility.
This influx of capital will ease capacity shortages but it is unlikely to be
sufficient to depress rates, which have risen strongly since 1989 following
a series of multi-billion pound insurance losses. The impact of hurricane
Andrew last year, which left losses of more than Dollars 15.5bn and was the
biggest ever US catastrophe loss, underlined the increasing scale of
catastrophes in recent years.
Mr Alan Badanes, who specialises in insurance mergers and acquisitions with
Chase Manhattan, says that even after the most recent announcements in
Bermuda, the amount of new money is still dwarfed by the volume of capital
which has left the industry in recent years. 'Any way you look at it there
is a big hole to fill. In terms of raw supply and demand this means prices
should hold up for the next few years,' says Mr Badanes.
In London, underwriters and brokers expect the extra capacity will allow
them to stabilise covers and rates at present levels. They stress that at
least as far as the 1994 renewal season is concerned most Bermudian
underwriters are following the rates set by underwriters in London.
Mr Richard Keeling, underwriter with Murray Lawrence syndicate 362, and a
leader of reinsurance business in London, says that some buyers of
catastrophe covers, from Australia, for example, could even face rate
increases. But he hopes that increases will be avoided elsewhere. 'With a
bit of luck we can stabilise the catastrophe product.'
Mr Keeling is expecting the most substantial rate increases in the market
for risk excess covers, which cover the peak exposures of a ceding company.
Rates in the risk excess market vary by as much as 500 per cent. 'The market
has got to a point where it needs to be repricing the product.'
The 'hardening' is likely to be as pronounced in the proportional market -
where reinsurers assume a set percentage of exposures in return for the same
percentage of original premium less a ceding commission. Europe's biggest
reinsurers are still not satisfied that rates have been increased to
adequate levels. Last year the withdrawal of Munich Re and some of its
European rivals from some markets increased capacity shortages and spurred
further rate increases.
Munich Re excluded some catastrophe risks from policies in the
hurricane-prone Caribbean, for example, and refused to cover terrorism in
policies sold to UK insurers, following the IRA bomb attacks of April 1992.
This latter move caused confusion in the UK industry and, in spite of the
establishment of a new government-backed reinsurer, Pool Re, many of the
country's businesses are now not protected from terrorist incidents.
Dr Fedor Nierhaus, a management board member at Munich Re, says that
original rates for earthquakes and storms are still too low in almost all
markets and that commercial lines business is still heavily underpriced,
hinting that further tightening could be on the way. 'We have taken the view
that we can't follow these inadequate original rates any longer. We can only
agree a separate reinsurance price. If we cannot get an adequate price we
must reduce coverage,' he says.
Reinsurers are likely to press for the introduction of loss participation
clauses and lower commissions on proportional business. Reinsurers could
also insist on new restrictions to the wordings of proportional treaties,
including caps on catastrophe exposures.
Caps have been introduced in most American proportional treaties over the
last 12 months, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. Dr
Nierhaus says Munich Re intends to press for similar changes elsewhere and
says that reinsurers will be unable to give 'unlimited cover for each loss
event'. The company will 'pursue this limitation. It is a matter of
fundamental importance,' he adds.
Underwriters in London now expect other European reinsurers to follow suit,
a development which could leave some European insurers with problems. 'This
is very serious especially for French and German insurers who have no idea
about the size of their exposures,' said a Lloyd's underwriter. These
companies will come under more more pressure from their reinsurers to
provide more detailed information to their reinsurers detailing their
exposures to storm and other catastrophe risks.
One other implication is that hard pressed and financially weak direct
insurers may be unable to use proportional treaties to bolster their
capital.
The proportional market could also see some other changes with European
underwriters of liability and motor business refusing to offer unlimited
cover except where it is a legal requirement to do so.
A leading London broker says that reinsurers successfully pushed through
these changes during the Australian renewal season at the beginning of July,
although they were less successful in the South African market.
Overall, though, current developments seem likely to reinforce the recent
trend in the market for reinsurers to carry a greater proportion of exposure
on thir own books, rather than syndicating them widely with dozens of
reinsurers sharing a small part of each contract. 'The flight to capital and
the flight to quality will continue,' says Mr Badanes. 'Rather than 70
different reinsurers all taking small lines on one reinsurance contract,
there will be fewer but larger companies and larger lines.'
Mr Michael Palm, executive vice-president of Centre Re, believes 'a smaller
market made up of larger players' is emerging. 'Pricing and terms will be
controlled by the large and well capitalised companies,' he adds.

FT  06 SEP 93 / People: Waterways Ombudsman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Ponsonby of Shulbrede has been appointed Waterways Ombudsman, largely,
she believes, on the strength of her experience as a barrister and
arbitrator. Every year millions of people use Britain's canals: boaters,
anglers, and freight carriers.
If they have cause to complain of maladministration by British Waterways,
the nationalised body that runs the canals, reservoirs, towpaths and
buildings, they have recourse to BW's complaints procedure. If still not
satisfied, Lady Ponsonby is their last resort.
No one really knows how busy she may turn out to be; British Waterways says
it keeps no overall record of how many moaners it gets annually. But Lady
Ponsonby is not one of them; she acknowledges never having taken a canal
boat holiday, 'though I have walked along a good few towpaths'.
During her three-year contract, Lady Ponsonby, 61, plans to stir the waters
a bit: 'British Waterways will have to abide by my decisions, and if they
don't like them, too bad - they're stuck with me,' she says.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Management: Changing face of the MBA - As demand for courses
falls, business schools are reassessing their role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent cartoon in the Christian Science Monitor conveys an uncomfortable
message for modern managers. It pictures the IBM 'juggernaut' careering off
the road and a clearly bemused 'driver' under the caption 'I don't
understand . . . we all went to the top business schools'.
Management education is going through a rough patch on both sides of the
Atlantic. Demand for MBA courses is down 17 per cent in the US and by
roughly the same figure in the UK. Companies are sending fewer managers on
executive programmes; and contracting higher education budgets mean fewer
faculty jobs for academic staff. The more honest and forward-looking
business school heads, however, acknowledge that economic recession is not
the sole culprit. Current uncertainty, they concede, has as much to do with
changing perceptions of the value of an MBA.
One such realist is Jim Schmotter, dean of the College of Business and
Economics at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, and a former associate dean
and director of international studies at the Johnson Graduate School of
Management at Cornell University. Addressing human resource directors at a
one-day conference at Manchester Business school last Thursday, Schmotter
identified the main trends in North American management education with
disarming frankness.
Reinforcing the cartoon theme - that maybe the emperor has no clothes -
Schmotter almost masochistically cited a New York consultant who advises
Fortune 100 companies on their MBA recruitment. 'She (recently) observed
that companies are now hiring MBAs primarily because of the work experience
they had before entering school because they see no value that we on the
campus add. And they are hiring far fewer. Further, they do not see business
school faculty as qualified to help them solve important business problems.'
Whether you agree with this bleak assessment or not - the Lehigh dean and
most of his audience would presumably strongly beg to differ - Schmotter's
point is that views like this are part of the market reality. How are
business schools responding?
Schmotter outlined four strategies.
Do nothing, or as he put it, 'get down into my tenured bunker and wait for
the economy to rebound'. Blaming others - naive students and short-sighted
corporations - is part of this approach.
Expand courses with features that look attractive, such as outward-bound
leadership programmes, overseas trips or 'non-credit' sessions on speaking
and etiquette. Schmotter argues that business schools have no comparative
advantages in these areas, and none of it affects the curriculum or faculty.
Gear up the public relations machine, proclaim commitment to the 21st
century and try to get front page news coverage every day. Schmotter's
verdict: 'Again, style over substance.'
Finally, and most positively, introduce genuine reform. The task is not to
be underestimated but he suggests that 'schools such as Michigan, Case
Western Reserve, and Babson College are rethinking what they do - and from
all we hear Harvard is soon to join this trend'.
Schmotter believes that business schools will have to change because global
corporate restructuring is resulting in fewer jobs of the kind MBAs have
traditionally held. Schools will have to add more value to students'
employability and alter their expectations. They will have to develop more
real partnerships with companies.
Shrinking resources will put a premium in business schools on the sort of
concepts normally taught, rather than acted on, by academics: productivity,
total quality and continuous improvement to name but three.
Business school 'constituents', meanwhile, will increasingly continue to
insist on a market-driven, rather than a product-driven mentality. Trends
towards tailored, company-specific programmes are appearing in MBA
education, too, and rankings are here to stay.
MBA schools are also realising they cannot cover the waterfront, and
specialisation - practised with success by the Thunderbird School and the
University of South Carolina - is according to Schmotter the key to market
share.
The European model, he concedes, is finding converts in the US and schools
there 'face sophisticated competition. . . for the best students, faculty
and corporate support'. 'MBA education,' he adds, 'is a global phenomenon.'
That in part explains why much of Schmotter's analysis is echoed in Europe:
the growing PR awareness is particularly marked, and course reform is
exemplified by the growth of distance learning, the sometimes discreet
trimming of two-year MBA programmes and the development of intra-European
networks. League tables and other forms of independent ranking may become
more widespread, not least if the impasse over plans for a common European
system of accreditation is not broken.
Schmotter's thesis is one of opportunity as well as challenge, and in the UK
there is arguably plenty of both. A recent Institute of Management survey
reveals almost a third of UK companies admit to spending no time on
management training, while other evidence suggests most UK companies are
pleased if they devote 2-3 per cent (against the 25-30 per cent cited by
many Japanese executives).
As with the shoe salesman who returned disconsolate from Africa to say that
everybody there went around in bare feet, such statistics can be read in
more than one way.

FT  06 SEP 93 / People: Rhodes switches to Thorn lights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn Lighting Group has lost little time in making fresh main board
appointments following its sale to Investcorp, the Bahrain-based investment
bank, which in June this year paid Pounds 162m to Thorn EMI in what was
effectively a management buy-out. According to Investcorp, Thorn Lighting
will be seeking a flotation in the medium term.
Phillip Rhodes (right), a 46-year-old chartered accountant, has joined as
chief executive covering the UK, Ireland and central European territories;
Michael Frye, 47, chief executive of the engineering and machine tool
manufacturer B. Elliott, becomes a non-executive director with special
responsibility for Thorn Lighting's architectural lighting initiative and
design issues.
They join a main board of seven, and also a management executive board of
nine.
Rhodes was a main board director of the commercial support services group
BET between 1989-92, overseeing (as divisional chairman) the group's textile
rental, contract catering and facilities management in the UK, US and
Europe. Before that he held various posts with Guinness.
'There are lots of similarities in the marketing mix', of both Guinness and
Thorn, says Rhodes, a believer in general management 'being a universally
applicable skill'. Thus although there might seem to be a substantial leap
from spirits to lights and 'our customers are not consumers in the same way,
we nevertheless have to serve them efficiently and well'.
As happened with its sale of Kenwood Appliances and Thorn EMI Software to
their managements, Thorn EMI retains a stake in the new Thorn Lighting
company. The parent company receives Pounds 137m in cash, a 12 per cent
equity stake, worth Pounds 8.7m, and Pounds 16.3m in subordinated loan
notes.

Bridget Bloom, formerly agricultural correspondent of the Financial Times,
has been made a part-time commissioner of the Forestry Commission. The
appointment comes as the future of the Commission is being reviewed by an
inter-ministerial committee, with privatisation an option.
Bloom, 56, was the FT's Africa and later its defence correspondent, before
taking up the agriculture beat. She retired from the paper last year and is
a part-time commissioner of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
While writing for the FT she was strongly critical of government forestry
policy, until the abolition in 1988 of tax concessions that had encouraged
wealthy individuals to invest in large-scale tree-planting.
Seven of the 11 members of the Forestry Commission, its board of directors,
are non-executive.
The performance of the non-executives is strongly criticised in a submission
by the Institute of Chartered Foresters to a government review. The
Institute said it suspected that improvements in the running of the
Commission had been 'achieved in spite of the non-executive commissioners,
not because of them'.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Management: Back to school for industry - Managers are
sharpening up their skills through educational placements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time was when industry's involvement in schools was regarded as a good
public relations wheeze, paid for out of the same budget as charitable
donations. Today, however, UK companies are realising there are important
career development benefits for their managers.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, is one business
leader who supports participation by employees in community action and
education programmes. 'It's a big part of career development,' he said in a
recent interview with the FT (Management Page, July 2). 'I like to see
people in the trenches, not stuck in the back office. It's better than 1,000
management courses. It's playing the game for real.'
On Sir Allen's analysis, sending staff on educational programmes is an act
of enlightened self-interest - training is helped, while the company's
image, and the long-term health of the community around it, improve. Sending
employees into classrooms can also be a valuable first step to finding good
new recruits.
The bodies that co-ordinate education and the private sector are now trying
to ensure that their programmes will be useful for industry participants.
These include Young Enterprise, which uses corporate managers as advisers to
'boards' of 16-18-year-olds running dummy companies for vocational business
qualifications, and Understanding Industry, which arranges for managers to
give sixth-formers lessons in how industry works.
Research by Oxford University's delegacy of local examinations found that
companies are using secondments to the Young Enterprise scheme as a formal
and informal means of developing management skills. Work as a YE adviser
also conforms with the standards of the Management Charter Initiative, the
government-backed body for establishing common standards of managerial
training, which is backed by 1,614 companies.
Each Young Enterprise 'company' has a board of directors composed entirely
of students who raise starter capital of Pounds 250, and a workforce taken
mainly from friends at school. Over the next year, they attempt to make as
much money as possible from business activities. The children gain
vocational qualifications, and have the chance to win prestigious prizes in
competition against other youthful companies across the UK and Europe.
Managers from industry are required as advisers for each managing board.
Last year, more than 5,000 advisers were seconded to Young Enterprise
companies.
Corporate training managers say a young manager can derive excellent
experience by overseeing the birth of a small company, run by usually highly
enthusiastic teenagers. Midland Bank now has more than 400 Young Enterprise
advisers, and uses the scheme as a standard appraisal tool for any recruits
who hope to become small business advisers.
According to Oxford University's research, each adviser must play roles as
team players and managers, but must also work as a 'catalyst', consultant
and manager of learning. They must also assess and audit their students'
work. It is a big commitment, involving one two-hour session each week with
the youthful boards of management, plus duty on some Saturdays towards the
end of the year when the companies take their wares to trade fairs and make
presentations.
But former YE advisers find the experience invaluable. Isobel Day,
remunerations and benefits officer for Guinness Brewing in north London,
advised a company called Le Pose at Queens Park Community School in Brent.
In a turbulent year of existence it appointed four separate managing
directors, and drastically revised its accounts several times. Day said she
learnt to take an overview of the range of a company's functions - not
otherwise easy in a company the size of Guinness - and also gained insights
into the problems of team leadership and co-ordination.
Under Day's guidance, Le Pose eventually raised enough money by offering car
washes and making Christmas cards to go to France and take advantage of the
then favourable exchange rates to buy cheap goods, which the children then
sold in north London. Its campaign came to a climax with a highly regarded
presentation to a group of business leaders, including Martin Sorrell, chief
executive of WPP, which had been organised by Business in the Community.
According to Day, Guinness has now established Young Enterprise involvement
as 'very much a useful career development tool'. This judgment is shared by
United Biscuits, another big employer in Brent, which also involves its
managers in YE programmes.
Understanding Industry organises a less onerous programme that also allows
junior managers to gain extra perspectives on their work.
UI courses are offered as a bloc to Sixth Form colleges, and lead to a
diploma at the end of the course. During the term, the aim is to introduce
students to all sectors of industry, and to each of the various management
functions. Different volunteer managers from industry address the class each
week to explain their job, and to take them through model exercises.
Past volunteers attest that the experience of explaining themselves to a
group of curious sixth-formers helped their communication skills. They must
act as ambassadors for their companies, but avoid technical jargon, and also
review closely what their job is aiming to achieve. Students also have an
ability to ask questions that managers would otherwise never have asked for
themselves.
Like Young Enterprise, UI aggressively promotes its programmes as useful
training for managers, as well as for students. Powerful backers for its
latest campaign include Allied-Lyons, Esso, Marks and Spencer, Thorn EMI and
Boots.
Allied-Lyons expects all its managerial employees to take on external
community positions, with a particular emphasis on school governorships and
participation in Understanding Industry courses. The company sees
educational involvement as a part of overall managerial development, and an
opportunity to widen contacts.
Educational involvement, though, does not come cheap. Allied-Lyons
calculates that each secondment of a manager to take a UI course amounts to
a gift of Pounds 800 for the school.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The P&amp;0 company BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 10.5m contract
to build a 67,000 sq ft superstore for Safeway in Reading, Berkshire.
Situated on Basingstoke Road, the new store will also offer a range of other
facilities including a petrol station, post office, restaurant, baby
changing rooms and a dry cleaners.
Originally a rubbish dump and later a car showroom and servicing facility,
the site required special preparation before building work could begin. This
involved clearing waste materials and stripping off contaminated top soil up
to a depth of 6m.
As well as the construction of the store, petrol station and creation of a
667 space car park, Bovis is managing associated roadworks which will create
a new roundabout and access to the store.
Bovis will also fit out 35,000 sq ft of sales floor area in a 15-week
programme. Work carried out will involve the installation of all shop floor
services including underfloor heating, refrigeration units, checkouts, cash
transfer systems and security systems. All back-up services for the
coldrooms, freezers, ambient storage, bakery and food preparation areas will
also be installed.
Building work is due for completion in February 1994 and the store will open
in March 1994.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: German monetary policy in the spotlight -
Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will be the centre of attention this week with parliament resuming
work after the summer recess today and the Bundesbank's decision- making
council meeting again on Thursday.
The debate over whether the Bundesbank should or should not ease its
monetary policy will be fuelled by the expected publication tomorrow of
second quarter gross domestic product figures and July retail sales figures
during the week.
The consensus among economists is that the economy stagnated in the second
quarter. If true, that would lend support to the government's belief that
the recession has bottomed out. But the outlook for recovery is bleak, with
rising unemployment and continued self-doubt in Europe's biggest economy.
The weak state of the Japanese economy will be highlighted in the Bank of
Japan's latest 'Tankan' report on Friday. By coincidence international
monetary officials meet in Paris that day to prepare the way for the annual
International Monetary Fund meetings at the end of the month. Japan could
again find itself under pressure to expand its economy.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, the
financial information company.
Today: US, Labour Day market holiday.
UK, July credit business (up Pounds 200m), housing starts and completions.
Spain, August official reserves (Dollars 47bn).
Tomorrow: Germany, second-quarter western German GDP (unchanged on quarter).
Belgium, EC monetary committee meets in Brussels.
Wednesday: US, July wholesale trade, consumer credit (up Dollars 2.5bn);
Federal Reserve Board releases tan book.
UK, chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George
discuss monetary policy. Treasury releases monthly monetary report.
Canada, August help wanted index (88).
Thursday: US, initial claims week ended September 9 (330,000); state
benefits week ended August 28; 1993 real capital spending; second-quarter
productivity; money supply figures for week ended August 30 (M2 up Dollars
1bn). Japan-US deputy ministers meet in Washington.
Germany, Bundesbank council meets.
UK, CBI distributive trades survey. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke at Scottish
CBI dinner.
Canada, August housing starts, seasonally adjusted annual rate (163,000);
July motor vehicle sales (up 3.5 per cent on month); June labour income (up
2.3 per cent on year)
Australia, August unemployment rate (10.8 per cent).
Sweden, August consumer prices (unchanged on month, up 4.6 per cent on
year).
Friday: US, August producer prices (up 0.2 per cent on month), ex-food and
energy (up 0.2 per cent).
Japan, Bank of Japan Tankan report; 1993 Tankan capital spending estimate
(down 5 per cent); August manufacturing diffusion index (minus 54 per cent),
non manufacturing (minus 42 per cent)
France, August preliminary consumer prices (unchanged on month, up 2.2 per
cent on year). G7 deputies and OECD's Working Party Three meet in Paris.
Canada, August unemployment rate (11.5 per cent), employment (up 0.2 per
cent on month); July department store sales (down 2 per cent on year).
Norway, August consumer prices (down 0.1 per cent on month, up 2.3 per cent
on year).
During the week: Japan, August trade balance customs cleared (Dollars 7bn
surplus).
Germany, August final cost of living (unchanged on month, up 4.2 per cent on
year); July manufacturing orders (uncha-nged on month), retail sales (down
2.5 per cent); June trade balance (DM3.5bn surplus), current account (DM2bn
deficit).

Netherlands, August consumer prices (up 0.6 per cent on month, 3 per cent on
year)
Switzerland, August federal consumer prices (up 0.3 per cent on month, 3.4
per cent on year), unemployment (4.7 per cent).
Australia, July money supply and credit.

FT  06 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, reporting full-year results on Thursday, might sound more cheerful
about its prospects in the US following President Bill Clinton's more
conciliatory message about health care reforms this week.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended June are forecast at around Pounds 1.65bn
against Pounds 1.43bn a year earlier.
Underlying sales growth will be in the low teens but sales of new drugs
might be somewhat disappointing. A final dividend of 13p is likely making
20p for the year (17p a year ago).
Cadbury Schweppes is expected to deliver results in line with management's
bullish assessments of trading in recent months when it reports its
first-half figures on Thursday.
Many analysts forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 160m, up from
Pounds 126m last time.
Forecasts for Prudential, reporting on Wednesday, vary widely from Pounds
218m-280m pre-tax against Pounds 249m a year earlier. an increase in
dividend to about 4.5p from 4.1p is also forecast.
Better life insurance performance will be overshadowed by further heavy
losses on re-insurance.
Whether George Wimpey, reporting on the same day, returns to an interim
pre-tax profit from a loss of Pounds 7.2m a year earlier hangs in the
balance. Some analysts forecast a small profit, others a small loss. Its
second half will be stronger given the housing pick up.
Blue Circle should report on Thursday interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead
with the dividend unchanged.
AMEC's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be slightly lower on Wednesday
than last year's Pounds 10.6m.
Following a recent trading statement, Hillsdown Holdings' results tomorrow
will be carefully scrutinised.
It said it would achieve operating profits of not less than Pounds 80m, but
it has its work cut out to improve the profit-ability of its diverse food
businesses.
Coats Viyella on Thursday is forecast to report a moderate increase in
interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 54m from Pounds 46.5m a year
earlier.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Recovery is 'on track'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS OF rising confidence and improving company performance in the
Institute of Directors' latest business opinion survey provide clear
evidence that recovery is on track, the institute says today.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general, warned that business needed a period of
stability to build on the 'still fragile recovery'. The survey showed that
expansion could be inhibited by growing cashflow problems and 'any tax
increases in the November Budget could prove a serious setback'.
The institute's bi-monthly survey shows that in August 63 per cent of
members were more optimistic about the economy, compared with 55 per cent in
June. August's result came close to the 65 per cent of directors expressing
optimism in April - the highest confidence level since 1988.
A total of 56 per cent of directors reported increased business volume - up
from 49 per cent in June - while the proportion recording improved profits
rose from 45 per cent to 52 per cent. But only 27 per cent expected
employment levels in their companies to rise in the next six months,
compared with 35 per cent in June.
The survey shows a sharp rise in directors regarding cashflow as their main
business concern - up from 33 per cent in June to 41 per cent in August.
This, says the institute, strengthens the view that companies are starting
to look to the financing of expansion. Lower European interest rates,
subdued inflation and a tough November Budget will lead to a UK base rate of
5 per cent before the end of the year, Mr David Kern, chief economist of
National Westminster Bank, predicts in its September Economic and Financial
Outlook. But, he says, a rise in inflation will push the base rate back to
6.5 per cent by the end of next year.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Consumer confidence improved in August says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY

<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence improved last month but it is still too early to predict
a steady recovery in spending, says a survey carried out by NOP for Verdict,
the retail market research group, Neil Buckley writes.
The index for August was 118, up from 112 in June and July - and well above
the 109 in August last year - but still below the 125 reached in May.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Tyre-burning power station set to operate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S FIRST power station fuelled by waste tyres starts preliminary
operations in Britain this week, which when complete will enable it to
generate electricity by burning more than 8m tyres a year.
The West Midlands plant, employing 60 people, expects to burn 23 per cent of
Britain's waste tyres in its first year of operation. The project is the
latest waste-to-energy scheme under a contract with the Non-Fossil
Purchasing Agency, which encourages alternatives to coal-fired power.
The contract allows Elm Energy - a US joint venture between utility group
Nipsco and the tyre company Performance Services Corporation - to supply
power to 25,000 homes in the Midlands region.
If pre-production tests this week are successful, the company intends to
build another plant at East Kilbride in Scotland and to seek a suitable site
in the south-east.
Elm says the power station at Wolverhampton will be the cleanest in the UK,
pointing to Pounds 48m of equipment and plant installed to ensure that
emissions are well below maximum levels set by the World Health
Organisation.
Mrs Anne Evans, managing director, said that unlike fossil fuels, waste
tyres contain only low levels of carbon and none of the dioxins which lead
to greenhouse gases.
'This new technology is not an environmental problem. Our emissions are
between one hundred thousandth and one billionth of the allowable limits,'
she said.
Potentially harmful by-products of burning tyres are to be recycled. The
tyre industry will buy back zinc oxide, steel particles will be sold for
scrap, and calcium sulphate used for building materials.
Once purified, steam from the plant's generators will be transformed into
electricity by a 35 megavoltamp turbogenerator. Midlands Electricity will
supply the power to domestic users.
Tyre distributors including subsidiaries of Michelin, Pirelli and Goodyear
have signed contracts with Elm Energy.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Pits attract few private-sector bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR mining companies have made bids for fewer than half of 19
pits shut or mothballed by British Coal in its closure programme.
The deadline for the last five pits to be put out to tender is tonight, with
the likelihood that only one will attract a bid that involves mining. The
five are Coventry, Shirebrook in Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Mid
Glamorgan, Parkside on Merseyside and Sharlston in West Yorkshire.
As the final deadline approaches it is probable that only eight of the 19
stand a chance of reopening as mines. The others have either received no
bids or are the subject of tenders that involve the use of surface assets
only.
The government will use the private sector's lack of enthusiasm in its
argument for closing so many pits. However, the shortage of bids will
reinforce fears that the privatisation of British Coal next year will prove
difficult.
Although eight of the 19 pits may in theory reopen after the bids, it is
highly unlikely that the market is big enough to sustain all of them. Some
bids may be withdrawn and others rejected.
Of the final five pits to be put out to tender, Coventry is the only one
likely to attract a mining bid. Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial
director of British Coal, is thought to be considering an offer. If he made
a bid it would be his fifth for a mine being offloaded by British Coal.
The other main bidder has been RJB Mining. It is not interested in the five
pits in the last tranche after bidding for five of the first 14 to be put
out to tender.
Of the 14 the most popular is Betws in south Wales. Because of its
anthracite household coal it has attracted bids from Mr Edwards, Ryan
International and a management buy-out team.
Markham Main and Rossington, both in the Yorkshire region, have each
attracted two bids, one from RJB, the other from Mr Edwards.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Investment body increases activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOULD-BE investment regulatory body the Personal Investment Authority is
to launch a campaign to capitalise on the growing support it is receiving.
Although the plan for the PIA got off to a faltering start last September
and it has slipped nearly 12 months behind its original timetable, it has
now received the strong backing of the top investor protection body, the
Securities and Investments Board.
The PIA is expected to release this week further details of how it will
absorb all the members of two existing regulators, the life industry's
Lautro and financial advisers' Fimbra - and also certain investment firms
regulated by Imro, another investment regulator, and others regulated by
SIB.
The objective is to bring all the regulation of retail investment products
and services under the control of a single body. Members will range from the
biggest banks and life assurance companies to the smallest independent
financial advisers.
The plans of the PIA include:
Issuing a formal prospectus by the end of this year, leading in a few months
to recognition by SIB.
Selecting an 18-member board - a reduction on the 30-strong body originally
proposed, but more than the board of 'perhaps 15' recommended by Mr Andrew
Large, SIB chairman.
Authorising several thousand prospective member firms during the early
months of 1994, with the aim of starting operations before the middle of the
year.
Recruiting a chief executive, following a search by headhunters Spencer
Stuart.

A further four pits are each the subject of one bid. Mr Edwards has made an
offer for Trentham, near Stoke-on-Trent, while RJB has put in for Bevercotes
and Clipstone, in Nottinghamshire, and Easington in County Durham.
British Coal is assessing the merits of the bids, all of which are
accompanied by bonds totalling Pounds 60,000. Decisions are expected to take
at least another month.
Of the first 14 pits to be put out to tender three are the subject of bids
involving use of the surface assets only. They are Cotgrave and Silverhill,
in Nottinghamshire, and Vane Tempest in County Durham.
Pits for which there is no interest are Bolsover, in Derbyshire, Grimethorpe
and Houghton Main, in the Yorkshire region, and Westoe in Tyne and Wear.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Gas break-up 'should be rejected'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should reject the recommendations of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission for a break-up of British Gas, says the Oxford Institute
for Energy Studies in a report today.
'Other than on purely ideological grounds there appears to be little
justification for seeking greater liberalisation of the UK gas market,' it
says.
A free market would bring benefits to gas producers at the expense of
consumers, it says, and would lead to higher prices because of the
elimination of cross-subsidisation. Dismembering British Gas would threaten
a successful and international company without offering proven benefits.
The Oxford-based think-tank says gas consumers are by and large satisfied
with the performance of the gas industry, and the benefits from a more
competitive market are not clear-cut.
Last month the MMC recommended that British Gas be made to divest its gas
trading operations by 1997. It also urged the removal of its domestic market
monopoly by the year 2002 at the latest.
The Department of Trade and Industry will today publish the complete text of
the report. However, ministers are expected to take several weeks before
deciding whether to accept the recommendations of the report.

MOTOR INDUSTRY euphoria over last month's unexpectedly strong 17.76 per cent
rise in new car registrations is about to be partly damped by statistics
showing that key sectors of the commercial vehicles market remain unable to
shrug off recession.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will this week publish
figures showing that total commercial vehicle registrations in August were 2
per cent down on even the very depressed levels of the same month last year.
August, as with the car market, is by far the largest sales month for
commercial vehicles.
The problem is concentrated in the light and medium van market. Industry
analysts believe it indicates that the small companies and tradesmen who are
their main buyers want evidence that economic recovery can be sustained
before they are prepared to commit themselves to purchases.
August's sales of small vans, mainly based on cars such as the Vauxhall
Astra, were 6.66 per cent lower than the same month last year, and those of
panel vans, typified by Ford's Transit, were 5 per cent lower.
For the first eight months of the year the light van market was down 8.18
per cent at 41,000 and the panel van sector down just over 5 per cent at
about 60,700.
The heavy truck market has started to match the recovery trend in the cars
sector, as long-distance hauliers and other operators continue the overdue
replacement of fleets.
The 4,950 trucks over 3.5 tonnes sold in August represented a 20 per cent
rise from last year, slightly outperforming August's new car market.
Carmakers continued to express delight at the weekend over August's strong
sales performance. However, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, president of the SMMT and
chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said that this year's forecast total of
1.75m, although well up on 1992's 1.6m, was still far below the 2.3m of
1989.
By far the biggest winners in the August car figures were the Japanese and
French industries. Japanese cars took more than 13 per cent of the market
for the first time, although the figures include production from UK car
plants.
Citroen and Renault each saw sales increases of about a third.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Businesses warn chancellor against harming upturn: FT
writers report on the controversy over the November Budget and gauge the
views of voters and industry
</HEADLINE>

BUSINESSES ARE warning Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against raising
taxes in November's Budget. Higher taxes would pose a serious threat to
recovery, it is claimed, weakening consumer demand and undermining
industry's confidence to invest.
The British Retail Consortium, representing 300,000 retail outlets, said it
had written to Mr Clarke urging him not to extend value added tax. 'We are
completely opposed to any extension of the VAT base,' it said.
Retailer WH Smith said it was preparing to launch a co-ordinated lobbying
campaign with publishers and other booksellers to try to persuade Mr Clarke
not to impose VAT on books. The company said: 'We have fought on this issue
on three separate occasions since 1985, so we are used to this battle. But
we have to say the omens look less favourable this time.'
Many retailers fear that an increase in either direct or indirect taxation
could weaken consumer spending. In particular they fear that moving the
Budget to November might pose a threat to the vital Christmas trade. Some
retailers make as much as 90 per cent of their annual profits in the
Christmas and new year period.
Industry bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry and the
Institute of Directors are preparing their Budget submissions for delivery
later this month.
The CBI stopped short of calling for no tax increases. It noted, however,
that the government had already announced tax increases of Pounds 10.5bn
over the next three years in the last Budget. 'We don't want anything that
adds to the burden on business, or endangers recovery,' it said.
Mr John Neill, chief executive of the components group Unipart, pointed out
that the motor industry had received Pounds 1.6bn of help through the
abolition of special car tax. 'It's probably right that the chancellor
should seek to claw some of that back, perhaps through higher petrol duty or
road fund licences,' he said.
But putting up corporate, employment or personal taxation would devastate
Britain's global competitiveness, he said. 'The government must do
everything to cut the national overhead, because otherwise it will drown
British industry.'
Mr John May, managing director of Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency
chain, wanted the chancellor to give priority to spending cuts.
He believed house buyers were particularly sensitive to personal tax
increases in the early stage of a recovery. 'To increase taxes this year
would be very damaging to the recovery,' he said.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Bury voters want alternative to cuts in services: FT writers
report on the controversy over the November Budget and gauge the views of
voters and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent

MS KAREN Sinacola, who works at the black pudding stall in Bury, Greater
Manchester, hopes that the government will neither raise taxes nor cut
services. 'Isn't there something in between they can do?' she asked.
She did not vote in last year's general election, but intends to vote Labour
next time. 'They may tax us more, but I don't suppose they can do worse,'
she said.
Ms Nicola Bailey, assisting on the black pudding stall, was not old enough
to vote last year. As for the next election: 'I don't know what I'll do yet,
but I'll probably vote Conservative.'
Politicians pay close attention to voters in Bury. They remain prime Labour
targets in a north-west England cluster of 10 marginals which will be
essential to any Labour victory.
Mr Norman Diggle retired last Wednesday as Bury's town centre postman. He
and his wife Audrey will have to live on just under Pounds 100 a week of
state pension and a small sum from his 11 years with the Post Office. 'Now
I'm a pensioner, I certainly do not want more taxes,' he said, as the couple
did their weekend shopping in Bury market. 'Lower taxes are what we voted
for. But services have been cut enough. It's a tricky situation.'
Mr Brian Nolan, a payroll manager who was made redundant twice in the 1980s,
had a clearer view: 'Whether I'm in favour of higher taxes depends on who
they are going to tax. They usually tax the ordinary people. Thatcher
doubled VAT and Major put it up to 17 1/2 per cent.
'This hit everybody, especially the poor. My wife is a social worker and she
sees the effect of it all on people. I want no more cuts. I would rather
they put any tax increase on PAYE, then only the people who are earning
would be paying.'
Mr James Wallace, who has sold eggs in the market for 29 years, expects to
have to pay more. 'Whether I'm in favour depends on the alternative. If it
will avoid more cuts, I suppose tax increases are inevitable. But they
should be overall because that would be fairer.'
A young father with his infant son in a pushchair was similarly resigned,
but wanted high earners hit hardest. 'I'm not giving my name because I'm
worried about being sacked for speaking out. I work for one of the
privatised utilities and they don't like employees speaking to the media,'
he said.
'What has really upset me has been the wage rises the bosses have given
themselves. I think there is much more bad feeling about directors' pay than
there would be over tax rises. If the basic rate of tax went up 1 per cent
or 2 per cent, but went to the National Health Service, I wouldn't be
worried,' he added.
More important for the government, however, is that both Mr Wallace and the
young father voted Conservative last year. So did Mr and Mrs Diggle. Mr
Nolan voted for Mrs Thatcher in 1979 but has since floated between Labour
and the Liberal Democrats. He said he would vote Labour next time.
The good news ends there for Labour, however. It was impossible to find
anyone - even among the party's supporters - who believed it was going to
win the next election.
Mr Wallace said as he sold another carton of large eggs: 'I think the
Liberal Democrats will do better next time, but I don't think Labour will
win.'
This was also the view of the young father. He expects a hung parliament.
His wife, however, was adamant: 'I won't vote Labour. I'm not a socialist
and I don't believe in socialism. But I don't believe in all this
privatisation either.'
She added: 'They have invited private-sector bids for parts of the social
security department and the Inland Revenue. It's wrong. How do you guarantee
confidentiality about individuals' tax and benefits if you put the records
into private hands?'

FT  06 SEP 93 / Graduate job prospects continue to deteriorate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYMENT prospects for new graduates have worsened again, figures released
today show.
The proportion of graduates finding long-term employment by the end of the
year in which they left university fell to 43 per cent last year.
It was the fifth successive annual fall, figures from the Universities'
Statistical Record show. In 1986-87, 60 per cent of graduates found
long-term jobs. The latest figure is lower than the 49.5 per cent reached in
the trough of the last UK recession in 1980-81.
Last year the proportion believed to be totally unemployed, without even
temporary work, rose from 9.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent.
Graduates also shifted away from industry - the destination for 23 per cent,
down from 25 per cent the year before - and towards commerce - up 1
percentage point to 31 per cent.
Employers' organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry,
predict that companies will start to recruit graduates again before economic
recovery is fully under way, and graduate recruiters earlier this summer
detected a 'small but discernible upturn' in demand. This has yet to be
reflected in any figures.
Only 'old' universities, and not the former polytechnics which have become
universities, are included in these figures.
The number of students graduating from education courses fell 2.4 per cent
last year, the Universities Statistical Record shows. All the other subject
groups registered a rise, with an average of 6.3 per cent.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Major faces test over tax policy: FT writers report on the
controversy over the November Budget and gauge the views of voters and
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PRIME MINISTER John Major was last night facing a new test of his leadership
as the Tory right stepped up its efforts to head off possible tax increases
in the November Budget.
As Mr Major prepared to return to Downing Street tomorrow after his
Portuguese holiday, rightwing ministers were insisting that tax and spending
should be discussed on Thursday at the first Cabinet meeting since the
summer break.
Downing Street yesterday described the meeting as 'very much a reporting
Cabinet', with ministers outlining summer developments in their departments
in general terms.
But rightwing ministers were adamant that the debate over the best way of
narrowing the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement should not be
kept off the agenda, arguing that the general political situation could not
be discussed without talking about spending.
Cabinet's spending committee, EDX, is not scheduled to reconvene until next
week.
An acrimonious debate about whether further tax rises should play a part in
the government's drive to reduce the budget deficit has rumbled on in Tory
ranks all summer.
Already some are warning that the differences which have come to light could
prove as damaging as the rift on Europe which dominated the last
parliamentary session.
Yesterday brought a string of contributions to the argument, with Mr David
Mellor, a former Treasury minister, saying the option of tax increases had
'got to be kept up'.
Mr John Townend, rightwing chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee,
said supporters in his Bridlington constituency were telling him they did
not elect him to put taxes up. He was 'heartened by the fact that the battle
for spending cuts is making progress'.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, said Mr Major should tell
Cabinet colleagues that if they did not go along with government policy they
should 'quietly resign or retire'.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Clarke to bolster finance initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, will this week use his first big speech
after the August holidays to attempt to inject fresh momentum into the
government's flagging private finance initiative.
Addressing the Scottish Confederation of British Industry in Glasgow, Mr
Clarke is expected to announce that a government guide to the initiative -
which is intended to encourage the use of private investment for public
projects - will be published this month. The guide will be aimed primarily
at industry and financial institutions.
He is also expected to foreshadow a possible solution to one of the problems
hampering the sort of private and public-sector partnerships that the
government is trying to nurture - the Treasury requirement for competition
for public-sector contracts.
Such competition can act as a disincentive to companies coming up with
innovative proposals because, once adopted, the proposals must be put out to
competitive tender for implementation. A company devising a project could
find a competitor winning the contract to build it.
One way forward would be to examine the intellectual property rights of
project proposals so companies that develop them could be paid for their
efforts.
The chancellor's comments in the speech, which will also focus on the
Scottish economy, will be eagerly awaited by industrialists and financiers
who are keen to see progress on the private finance initiative.
The initiative was launched with much publicity in last year's Autumn
Statement. But since then the government has announced no significant new
public-sector project involving private finance and the hiatus has caused
concern.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said recently that the initiative
would be discredited unless 'real holes can be dug in the ground pretty
soon'.

FT  06 SEP 93 / A piece of the action for chess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Nigel Short and Gary Kasparov sit down in London's Savoy Theatre
tomorrow for the Chess World Championship there will be more than chess at
stake.
For the Pounds 1.7m match is not only proving to be one of the most
colourful in recent history, but also the most commercial.
With the contest now as controversial as the 1972 Spassky-Fischer world
champion chess match, the promoters claim they have the making of a
lucrative chess marathon. Up to 24,000 tickets will be on sale and a range
of related promotions and match merchandise is planned.
But since Short is the clear underdog - in spite of his training programme
of swimming, weightlifting and computer analysis - the promoters still face
problems in pitching chess as a spectator sport.
The contest will be fought in 24 matches spread over two months. The winner
is the one who gains more than 12 points, with a won match worth two points
and a draw one point. Despite a barrage of publicity, by last weekend only
three-quarters of the first week's tickets had been sold - even after some
were reduced to Pounds 10 from earlier prices as high as Pounds 150.
The promoters insist television coverage should boost audiences later.
Channel 4, which has bought 'live' television rights, will show 60 hours of
the match, using a panel of 'expert commentators' to fill in the pauses.
Channel 4 said: 'It will be a format a bit like Test match cricket - the aim
is to explain it to people who know nothing.'
Even by the Byzantine standards of chess, the politics behind the contest's
sponsorship have been bewildering.
The battle started seven months ago when Fide, the international chess
organisation, announced that Manchester would stage the match - a choice
that seemed apt, given that Short, the 28-year-old bespectacled chess star
who is Britain's first world champion chess challenger, is from nearby
Bolton. But Kasparov's dislike for Fide and Short's disappointment with
Manchester's Pounds 1.2m prize money led the players to reject the bid and
form a rival chess group.
Fide blacklisted the players and staged its own 'world championship', which
started in Holland this weekend.
Short and Kasparov reopened the bidding battle, which was won by The Times
newspaper and the telecommunications company Teleworld, which offered Pounds
1.7m prize money, five-eigths of which goes to the winner.
Meanwhile, the BBC seems uncertain if the game is a sport. It has enlisted
Newsnight reporters Peter Snow and Francine Stock to host its coverage of
the game - journalists better known for dissecting complex current affairs.
Given events so far, it may be an appropriate choice.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Call on frozen beef rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rejected calls from the Labour party to withdraw on
health grounds surplus European Community meat which has been released on to
the market after being held for long periods in cold storage.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, said on BBC Radio
that the government had 'behaved shamefully' by withholding from the public
the origin of the EC beef and the date on which it had first been put into
storage. Without it, he argued, the consumer could not know for certain
whether the meat was safe.
He was responding to a report in yesterday's Sunday Times newspaper that the
release of deep-frozen surplus beef up to six years old was prompting
concern about the quality of meat used primarily in pies and sausages.
Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the Consumers' Association, said
last night: 'It is outrageous that EC beef is just being dumped on the
market and consumers are not told anything about it.'
The UK's beef 'mountain' reached a record 164,389 tonnes last year partly
because of the recession and partly because other EC countries refused to
buy UK beef after an out-break of BSE, or 'mad cow' disease.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Pick-up expected in pay increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST increase in pay rises to between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent, in
line with inflation, is likely early next year, Industrial Relations
Services says today in its forecast for the coming 12 months.
IRS, an independent research organisation, expects companies to make greater
use of merit pay and profit-related increases.
It adds that company performance and the ability of an employer to pay will
be the most influential factors in deciding the level of awards for the next
12 months.
More than half the 300 companies involved in the survey said they planned to
offer lower wage rises than they had in the past 12 months.
While almost 30 per cent said they would provide higher rises, 25 per cent
said they would give the same increase as previously.
IRS says that basic wage rises are levelling off at about 2.5 per cent.
Pay comparability between wage levels in the same industry was a factor in
deciding levels, according to half of the companies.
The survey found that the constraints on wage growth over the next 12 months
will 'remain intense'. Almost 60 per cent mentioned 'poor company
performance' as particularly influential as a downward pressure on pay
deals.
But there are signs in the IRS survey that companies will be less ready to
cut their workforces in the next 12 months. More than two-thirds of them
said they would not be shedding jobs in the next year. More manufacturers
than service enterprises were planning job cuts.
The survey is based on the views of personnel and industrial relations
practitioners and pay decision-makers in 315 private-sector companies
employing 771,400 people between them. More than half the organisations are
in manufacturing and 37 per cent in private services. The survey was carried
out in July.

recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING remains in recession with falling order books and continuing
redundancies, yesterday's employment trends survey by the AEEU engineering
and electrical union shows. Just four companies of 100 surveyed had
vacancies for skilled or semi-skilled workers. Some 27.5 per cent announced
redundancies in the second quarter of the year compared with 20 per cent in
the first quarter, and 16 per cent had poor order books compared with 17.5
per cent in the first quarter.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Monks looks across the pond: New chief draws on US
experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MONKS, who this week becomes TUC general secretary, wants to draw on
lessons from the US labour movement in his efforts to reverse the trend of
declining union membership.
'I admire the toughness and professionalism of the American unions,' he said
yesterday. 'They have to live and work within a difficult business
environment in the face of large, heavily anti-union multinational
companies.'
The 48-year-old Mancunian, who takes over from Mr Norman Willis at the end
of the week as general secretary after 23 years in the organisation's
bureaucracy, is particularly keen to emulate US labour recruitment campaigns
that use computer co-ordination and seek broader alliances in the community.
The TUC plans to take the initiative by launching campaigns to publicise the
relevance of trade unionism to the estimated 66 per cent of workers no
longer in unions.
A test campaign will be held in Bristol, where a number of unions intend to
launch a co-ordinated recruitment drive soon. Local union activists will be
mobilised to try to persuade workers who do not belong to unions to join
them.
If the Bristol campaign succeeds then the TUC will shift its efforts to
other cities.
Immediately after this week's congress the TUC will prepare its campaign to
reach each of the 6m trade unionists estimated to have their membership
subscriptions paid out of their pay by their employer under the so-called
check-off system.
Under the new Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act every trade
unionist has to agree to union check-off within the next 12 months. Many
union officials fear this could produce a dramatic fall in membership as
workers decide not to renew their subscriptions.
Unions will be encouraged to move their members to the direct debit system
of payment as a way of protecting their finances. 'Our check-off campaign
will be a good test of what we can do,' Mr Monks said.
The TUC plans to concentrate its campaigning efforts in four priority areas
 -health and safety, pensions, vocational and trade union training, and
equal rights. It wants to co-operate with other organisations at regional
and local level.
'We want to make the TUC the kind of organisation that people admire and
respect, talking good sense and saying things that chime in with their
experience,' Mr Monks said.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Committee absences at 50%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-ATTENDANCE at many of the TUC's key committees is running at well over
50 per cent and reaching as high as 80 per cent for the education and
training committee. That is the finding of an informal survey by Mr Roger
Lyons of the MSF white-collar union.
Mr Lyons, whose survey was based on three meetings of each committee in the
past year, said that the figures proved the need for a radical reform of the
committee structure.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Part-timers prove shy of unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNIONS are finding it increasingly hard to recruit part-time workers,
a survey published yesterday by Labour Research magazine shows.
It found only 16 per cent of the combined membership of the country's 20
largest unions are part-timers although as many as 28 per cent of the
workforce now work part-time, of which four out of five are women. Labour
Research calculates only 22 per cent of part-timers are in unions, compared
with a quarter of them five years ago.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Workers' fear of job loss lessens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEAR OF unemployment and job loss among Britain's workers has declined in
the past nine months, according to a survey carried out for the TUC, Robert
Taylor writes. The findings suggest a recovery of optimism about economic
prospects in the workplace.
As many as 65 per cent said they did not think there would be job losses at
their workplace in the next 12 months, compared with 50 per cent who
believed this last December.
Only 11 per cent thought it was likely that they would lose their job in the
next 12 months, compared with 15 per cent back in December.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Row looms over return of ousted members: Issue of
electricians triggers controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PUBLIC row over the proposed return of the electricians to the TUC is
almost certain at congress after yesterday's decision by the TGWU general
union to submit an emergency resolution on the issue.
Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said his union opposed the TUC's
peace formula designed to smooth over divisions over membership poaching
between the electricians - now part of the AEEU engineering union - and
other unions in the construction industry.
Mr Morris said: 'We want to have a permanent settlement of the problem and
not a short-term solution.' It remained unclear last night, however, whether
the motion would be accepted for debate.
Britain's biggest union - Unison, the public service union - agreed
yesterday to back the TUC's plan for the return of the electricians after
six years' absence since their expulsion from congress.
It seems likely that the majority of congress will support this but many
delegates remain bitter about the electricians, who used their absence from
the TUC to recruit members from other unions.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Smith's backers confident on union reform: Labour leader
seeks to reassure TUC congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS OF Mr John Smith's campaign to reform the Labour party's links
with the trade unions insisted last night that he could still win the vote
at the party conference in three weeks time.
They also believe that Mr Smith's address to the TUC congress tomorrow,
which will stress the vital importance of strong trade unions, will quash
the notion that he is anti-union.
The Smith camp has been boosted by the probability that Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, will shift in its favour, and the possibility that Nupe,
the public service union, will do the same.
The Usdaw executive meets next week and Mr Garfield Davies, the general
secretary, said he was confident that it would vote for the introduction of
one-member-one-vote for the selection of party candidates - the key issue in
dispute.
Even with the support of Usdaw and Nupe, however, the vote will be very
close and could result in defeat for Mr Smith. That, warned Mr Davies, would
be a 'very serious blow' for his leadership.
Mr Bill Jordan, head of the AEEU craft union, the main union backing reform,
also said that 'the public would reasonably assume that if the unions can
dictate to Mr Smith as leader of the opposition' then they could also do so
if he was prime minister.
In spite of attempts by union leaders to prevent discussion of the
Labour-union links issue, it is set to dominate the TUC congress and the
approach to the Labour conference at the end of the month.
There is no sign that the two key unions opposing Mr Smith's version of
reform - the GMB and TGWU general unions - will shift. But one GMB official
did suggest that if unions were to pay for their own members to join the
party that might retain the federal principle of union affiliation that the
general unions want to preserve.
Mr Smith's backers will be trying to persuade union leaders that they can
disregard any conference votes against the reform package because they came
prior to the recent proposal of cut-price party membership for union
members. That proposal, taken up by the Smith camp, came originally from Mr
John Prescott, one of Labour's senior MPs most popular with union leaders.
Some supporters of Mr Smith speculate that he could turn a defeat on the
issue to his advantage by being seen to take a strong stand on an issue of
principle. He would then keep fighting on the issue and get his way next
year.
One union official, who strongly supports the reforms, said yesterday that a
year of conflict between unions and the Labour leader 'would do no harm and
might even do some good' for Mr Smith's standing in the country.
Yesterday Labour's ruling national executive committee said that individual
party membership had risen from 1991's post-war low. The number of members
at the end of last year stood at almost 280,000 - an increase of about
18,000 from the previous year.
